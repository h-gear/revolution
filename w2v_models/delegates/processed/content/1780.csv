8303,dg014373,1780,the Virginia Board of Trade,"""the Virginia Board of Trade   Gentlemen, Philadelphia, January 3rd. 1780. In consequence of your letter to the Delegates of Congress in August last to procure from the Continent a sum of money adequate to purchases for the officers and soldiers in the Virginia line, I have this day with great difficulty negotiated 120,000 dollars with the board of Treasury which according to the determination of Congress must be instantly paid to the quarter-master general. Mr Moss upon an accurate settlement of his affairs in this City will fall in debt about that sum-and principally from the purchase of some light cloathing designed for the troops who are marching to the Southward. (1)It appears to me the purchase above mentioned was extremely judicious-to my Judgment things of that sort will be abundantly more expensive in the course of a few months, and perhaps not to be gotten at all. You will observe the order upon your board is drawn to the amount of 130,000 dollars; 120,000 being sufficient to answer JANUARY 3, 1780  the purposes of Mr Moss. I shall retain the remaining 10,000 dollars as so much of what the assembly are pleased to allow their delegates in Congress and the Treasurer will accordingly give your Board credit for that Sum and make it a charge agt. myself. I have the honor to be with great respect, Gentlemen, your most obedient and very humble servant, C. Griffin [P.S.] I suppose you have heard that Maryland has seized all the flour in that state designed for Virginia, and for the French fleet.(2) ""

8305,dg014375,1780,George Partridge to Joseph Ward,"""George Partridge to Joseph Ward   Dear Sir Philadelphia Jany 3d 1780 Yours of the 7th ultimo was duely receivd, but I did not design to have answered it till I could have informed you of the Determination of Congress on your repeated application, but least you should misconstrue such Delay, 1 would inform you that I am almost weary of making fruitless motions on that Matter,(1) no wonder then you'll say that your Patience is nearly exhausted-true-but when you consider the State of our currency, the State of our finances, and the consequent Difficulty of supplying a suffering Army, the Necessity of recruiting the Regts. & a variety of other Matters which your own Ingenuity will suggest, you will not perhaps think it so strange that it should be difficult to draw the attention of Congress to any Matter which they do not think of the greatest importance immediately to attend to, and which will take them sometime [to] adjust. However I make no doubt but that your Officers will have their Subsistance made good to them equally as Officers of the Line, and to commence from the same time. I shall not be inattentive to the Matter, but you are sensible that I have but one voice, & that a feeble one. It is my sincere wish that you may have ample Justice done you & speedily, & that you may continue to serve your Country in publick character being convinced that your abilities & Disposition are happily united to render it important Services. I am with great Regard, your most obedt. Humbe Servt, Geo. Partridge P.S. My Colleagues tell me that they will join with me in pushing this Matter immediately. ""

8306,dg014376,1780,William Ellery to William Greene,"""William Ellery to William Greene   Sir, Philadelphia Jany. 4th. 1780. Since I last had the honour of writing to your excellency (1) nothing material hath occurred: But as I may be thought negligent unless I write now & then to the Assembly I therefore now resume my pen. We have not received any foreign intelligence for a long time; and nothing domestick but the sailing of the long-talk'd-of embarkation from New York. They sailed in two divisions. The first, which consisted of more than an hundred sail, and which Genl. Washington says \""it is generally imagined consisted of returning transports and private vessels bound to Europe,\"" sailed on the 23d ultmo. The last division consisting of 110 sail, principally large ships, put to Sea A large number of troops were in this fleet; but how great the number, by whom commanded, and where destined is uncertain. It is generally thought that a part of them, at least, is bound to the Southward, and it is reported that Genl. Clinton in person commands the expedition. Genl. Parsons, who commands a body of troops advanced towards the sound, wrote Genl. Washington \""that a number of southern refugees are said to be on board the fleet, among them Governor Martin.\""(2) Last Tuesday we had a very heavy storm. I hope we may have the pleasure of adopting Queen Elizabeth's motto afflavit Deus et dissipantur. It is said that the Spaniard hath taken Pensacola. If this should prove true, and they should procede and capture St. Augustine, it would make a fine diversion in favor of Charlestown, provided the expedition from N. York should be intended against South-Carolina. A considerable body of troops are on their march to join Genl Lincoln; but will arrive there too late to succour Charlestown against the supposed intended attack. We are busily employed in financing and procuring supplies for the army. Bills of exchange are falling; and some people begin to be apprehensive of evils from appretiation. These are favorable symptoms. As we have put a stop to further emissions, if tax procedes, it is improbable that the money should further depretiate. A letter from the Genl. Treasurer of our State to the continental Treasury board gave them and me great pleasure.(3) It seems by that letter that a great part of our quota of the Tax was collected, and that the whole would be [in] the treasury by the first instant. Since I wrote the foregoing I have seen a gentleman from Maryland who informed me that Bills of exchange and every article were falling in that State when he left it, which was but a few days before. I have also since that time seen a letter from Genl Lincoln, but it contained nothing new. Congress have order'd the Treasury board to prepare bills of exchange; to be sold at the rate of twenty five  JANUARY 4, 1780  dollars for four & six pence Sterling, The purchaser when he receives his bill to deposit in the loan office, an equal Sum of contl. money to be estimated at that rate, for which he is to receive yearly six per Cent. I think I have expressed the Idea clearly; but the resolution will soon be published. The incessant and large demands of the Army, and the slowness with which taxes come in have made this measure necessary. This is indeed a very critical period. If we can however but get along for two or three months I hope we shall proceed with more ease and satisfaction in future. A considerable body of men have inlisted for the war. This well recruited will make a very respectable army. The only difficulty is to furnish it with supplies. If we can but give steadiness to our currency, and the several States will exert themselves, and obtain the quotas of supplies which will soon be assigned and recommended to them all our difficulties will be removed. Wishing success to every measure calculated for the public benefit, prosperity to the State of Rhode-Island and Providence Plantations, and health & happiness, with many New Years, to your excellency, I continue to be with great respect, Yr Excellency's most obedt. hble Servt. Wm. Ellery Please to turn over. P.S.(4) Since writing the foregoing, Congress has received a letter from Gen. Washington, dated Dec. 30th, 1779,(5) in which he mentions that, by the last accounts he can get of the British troops, which left New York the 26th ultimo, they consist of six British regiments: The grenadier and light infantry of the army, Rawlins' corps, the legion, the queen's rangers and the Hessian grenadiers, which will make about five thousand effectives.

The situation of our affairs here are truly distressing, owing to the disordered state of our money & finances; An army in want of one days supply; and demands upon the treasury daily for millions, & little or no money there; Is the honl. court really sensible of our distressed state; I must suppose they be, for what can congress say more than they have done; But don't, my worthy friend, think, I dispaire of the common cause, no, not if the army should be all disbanded; which some think will be the case.

8311,dg014381,1780,John Mathews to Thomas Bee,"""John Mathews to Thomas Bee   Dear sir, Philadelphia Jany. [5?] 1780.(1) I received yours of October 18 (intended by Mr. Rutledge) on the 30th Ulto. by Major Lucas, to whom Rutledge entrusted all his dispatches for this place, having at last given over all thoughts of being able to reach the place of his destination. The account Majr. Lucas gives me of him, is truely melancholy. I hope in God his disorder may take some favourable turn, so as he may be preserved to us, for I think his loss would be a heavy one to his Country, his family, & his friends. The present is not the time, further to discuss the matter of taxation, as I expect 'ere this reaches you, you will be warmly engaged in a business of a far different kind. It is destressing beyond expression, to hear the accounts I do from all quarters, of the disaffection, (I can call their late conduct nothing less) of our back country people. Good God! is their nothing to be done, that will tend either to perswaid, or coerce them to do their duty? Indeed My Dear Friend, the day is not to come, it does not depend on our Militia's not turning out to repel your present danger, which may subject us to the imputation of a want of vigour, the brand is already fixed on us. In passing through No. Carolina, & Virginia, whenever I urged the necessity of their sending men to our aid, the constant reply was \""how can South Carolina expect we will send our men to their support, when they will do nothing for themselves. Our men go there, sacrifice their health, their lives, & the So. Carolina Militia are snug at their own homes. It is too much for them to expect us to fight their battles for them.\"" Hints of the same kind, have been thrown out in Congress. Where I have principally appologized for our men in the first instance, in the second, I have treated such insolence, with the keeness [keenest] severity, for  JANUARY 5, 1780  let us be censured by whomever may, Congress are the last class of men on earth, who ought to presume to do so. Before I had received a Copy of Rutleges instructions, I had done everything that they required, except sending some part of the Stores, & it is too late now to be done. The three frigates are I hope safe with you as is likewise the Vessel with Military Stores. The Virginia & No. Carolina lines consisted of 3000 men, but on examining into their times of serving, such as would expire before they could reach you have been detained, which reduces them to about 2300 very fine men. If they were with you, I should be under very little apprehension about the loss of the town, but as they are at this day some 500 & the rest 600 miles from you, I almost despair. The great difficulty was in getting the men on their march, for want of necessaries, particularly Shoes, without which it was impossible for them to encounter the inclemencies of the season. Indeed some of the men suffered very severely in coming from camp here, for want of shoes, but now that they are marched, I am confident from the disposition of the Officers, not a moments time will be lost, and if the No. Carolina Militia can but support you, so as to hold the town, you need be under no apprehension about the expiration of their times of service, for before that happens these troops will certainly be with you. Blands & Baylors two Regiments of horse, I am in hopes will not be long after Master Clinton. Had Congress done their duty on the 10 of Novr. when I applyed to them for the troops,(2) they might have been the best part of their way through No. Carolina by this, but they first refused, then hesitated, untill the rivers were shut up by the ice, so that the men must now march the whole way by land. Which misfortunes are principally owing to a want of proper spirit in them at first. I can with a safe conscience say, I have done my duty to my Country, for there is nothing which I thought could be beneficial to it, but what I have applyed for, & by unremitted Sollicitations, as far as continental circumstances would admit of, have in the end procured. If it is too late, the fault is not imputable to me, & I flatter myself my Country will do me the justice to think so, & acquit me of any want of attention to their interest. You say, you wish to hear often from me. At any other time, such a request would have afforded me infinite pleasure, which I always have felt in communicated [communicating] my thoughts to so esteemed a friend. But I am too much with you, & my whole faculties are at present so much engroced by your destresses, that there is no space left in my mind to turn to anything that passes here. I must therefore reverse the proposition, & intreat of you to give me an account of everything that passes with you, as often as you can find leisure, & opportunity. I sent of an Express in two hours after we got the account of the sailing of the fleet from New York, & I strictly charged him to be there in sixteen days, which if he is, will give you information of it, before they can reach you. God send you success & JANUARY.6, 1780  as he has already twice preserved us from eminent danger, I hope he will yet once more guard over & protect us, from this greatest of all the tryals we have hitherto had to struggle with. And believe me to be, My Dr. Sir, with the most sincere regard, yr. most Obedt. Servt. [P.S.] You know who I am without a name, which for various reasons had better be omitted. ""

Mr Cranch delivered me your Favour of the 14th Decr. & I had an Oppertunity last evening of further conferring with Colo. Pickering on that Part of your former Letter which relates to the Expence of Waggons &c in the issuing Departmt.; he appears to be in Favour of a new Regulation, & will perhaps be more convinced of the Necessity thereof, by your stating particularly to the Board of War, the proposed Alteration, the Abuses which it is intended to correct, & an Estimate of the Sums to be saved thereby. With Respect to the Ballance due to You from the late Commissary Trumbull, I am unable to determine whether it will be possible or not, to obtain the payment thereof in Loan office Certificates bearing the Date of the Time at which the Money was advanced. Frequent Applications have been made to Congress to adopt that Mode of paying Debts, contracted by the Staff Departments for Articles supplied the Army, & all have been rejected; but there is a manifest Difference between Ballances due for Supplies on which the Creditor has charged his profit, & Cash Advanced by an officer to support the Credit & promote the Business of his Department, the latter of which as You have stated it, is precisely your Case. I am therefore of Opinion, that it will be best to profer a Memorial to Congress, & direct it to the president thereof, representing the Facts mentioned in your Letter, & in Support thereof, to transmit Mr Trumbulls Certificate.

I have the honour to forward by Brown two dozen blank Commissions with Instructions and Bonds. By late letters I have received from Amsterdam it is abundantly evident that your Excellency's Correspondence as also that of Governor Livingston with Baron V.D. Capelen hath enlighten'd & undeceived many people in Holland, & produced many Friends & favourable sentiments with respect to the cause in which we are engaged.(2) I hope Congress will take some honourary Notice of the Baron. I am told N. Jersey have Just passed a law appointing proper persons to purchase all articles of provision & forage for the army which that State can supply. I was in hopes to procure the act & send it forward by Brown. I believe a regulation of that kind will be generally adopted & cannot but hope it may be attended with beneficial consequences to the public. I have directed Mr Brown if he can obtain the above mentioned act in the Jersey's to take it with him.(3) I am favour'd with intelligence on which we place dependance that the late embarkation from N. York on the 23d & 26th ulto had Troops on board to the amount of 5,000 Effective Men their destination unknown & no intelligence has been received of them since they sailed.

Mr Laurens told me he met with great difficulty to get JANUARY 6, 1780  them Translated: few persons here understand the low Dutch, your last Letter from the Baron, I procured a Dutch Clergeman about Eight miles from this City to Translate.

But since I have hinted at increasing Opportunities of Conveyance, I must assure you that the days are too short for me at present by much to get pressing public Business off my Hands; and as to the Nights they are ten times more ruinous to my health than they were in Summer, I therefore hide myself from them within the Bed Curtains the Moment that public duty is discharged. In Truth, I am at length aiming to preserve some Remnant of a good Constitution for Situations into which you seem to think you would chide me if you was invested with those Rights of Chiding which a Church Parson's Certificate is presumed to have conveyed to another.

The State of Maryland has likewise passed a Law for the regulation of prices. New York Assembly is called on purpose to consider of the Matter. The Commissioners from Several of the States that were present Met last Evening pursuant to the recommendation of the Hartford Convention, viz two from New Hamshire, two from Connecticut, one from New Jersy, And one for Pennsylvania. Mr. L Homedieu was also present from the State of New York but he Says their Assembly made no Special appointment for this convention, & Supposes he has no right to Act.(2) I dont hear that any other States have appointed Members. I believe they expected that the resolution of Congress would Supersede the necessity of this convention. So that I dont think it will be of any advantage for the Assembly to wait, in expectation of having a report from this Convention for I believe there will be None. Mr. Bryan informed us that a great majority of the Assembly of this State were in favour of a regulation of prices before they Adjourned. They meet again the l9th of this month. I Should think Since the Press is Stopt it would not be difficult to reduce prices as low as twenty for one, Some people are much afraid the Money will Soon Appreciate very rapidly, and be attended with more pernicious effects than the depreciation has been.

8324,dg014394,1780,William Floyd to Pierre Van Cortlandt,"""William Floyd to Pierre Van Cortlandt   Dear Sir Philadelphia January 11th. 1780 I am now happy in being able to Inform you that the Divisions and party Spirit, which prevailed in Congress, During the last winter and Spring are Entirely Done away, and as that Spirit originated from Certain Questions Relative to Mr Dean & Mr Lee, That cause no longer Existing, it is to be hoped that the Effect will not happen again. A harmonious Disposition, to Do Business, prevails, And our Greatest Difficulty is, to know what to Do, in this Critical Situation of our Affairs. (Our money, our Army) The Recommendation of Congress for the Several States to provide Supplies for the Army by their own Exertions, I expect is before the Legislature, New Jersey whose Legislature was then Sitting has passed a Law for the purpose, and I understand it is now Executing much to the Satisfaction of the Inhabitants of the State. They have forbid all Deputy Commissarys Except those of their own appointment, and who act under their Direction, agreeable to Certain Rules Laid Down for them in the Said Law. And I am happy to hear that they are like to Suceed in Getting allmost all the Spare provisions JANUARY 11, 1780  and forage in that State for the use of the army. I hope Soon to have a Copy of their Law which I will Do my Self the pleasure to Send you. It would be Disagreable for me to mention and I believe for you to hear, the particulars of our Circumstances (and perhaps Improper). But it is necessary that you Should know, and our whole Legislature; that the Supplies for the army from the Several States, must be procured by their own Exertions, and if the four States nearest the Army, Should fail of Doing this; the worst of Consequences is to be apprehended. The General Regulation of prices as Recommended By Congress I Expect will take place, Maryland has passed a Law for the purpose, and New Jersey also, But the last mentioned State, I believe will be But Little affected with it, as their purchasers are much Engaged and I expect will either, Realy purchase, or Secure, all the Spare produce of the State by the time the Regulation is to take place; and that at the now going prices. Our money in this State (and I am told it is not much better in the States below this) is at a very ebb, a Dollar in this Market is Reckoned very little more than a penny, and yet it Goes if possible More Current than Ever and there is a great Cry of its being Scarce here, No wonder it is So, when it Requires near one hundred times as much as formerly, to do any Business. I do not expect the money is Depreciated in our State to the Degree it has here; But I do Imagine it has fell Sufficiently to Convince every one, of the propriety of our puting off the Sales of our forfieted Estates to the time we Did, for it appears very Evident now that if we had ordered an Immediate Sale we Should have lost nearly one half their value. I have Conversed with the Delegate from New Hampshire (1) Respecting the Vermont title, and the Claims which those people on the Lands have to Independence, and he Seems to be full with me in opinion that it will not Do to Suffer them to be so, But I think I can Discover in him a hope, or Rather a wish, that they might be annexed to New Hampshire; or at least that part which Lays to the Eastward of the Mountain. But at the Same time I think I Discovered-a faintness in his hope, and a Doubt whether his wishes would be accomplished. I have not as yet understood that Massachusetts Intend to put in any Claims to that Country.(2) Yesterday Congress Resolved to Inform General Lee that they had no further Service for him.(3) This Dismission, (tho' I never did like Lee, I have always Considered him as a very Imprudent man, Yet there appeared to me a kind of hardship, or Rather Cruelty in it) which prevented its having my Consent. As soon as the Vermont Business is over and the Roads will permit, I shall Return home leaving a full Representation here, But I fear it will hardly be possible to Cross the Country with a Carriage till   Spring.

Their principal dependance is on Connecticut for Beef. I wish there might be the most vigorous exertion to furnish a present Supply. The Commissary General informs me that he Sent to Your Excellency 200,000 dollars for that purpose. He will be furnished with a further Sum and intends to come that way himself very soon. Stopping the press Occasions a Scarcity of money. The States I believe are now collecting their taxes-but if they dont keep the money collected for the continent Seperate from that collected for their own use there will be danger of a deficiency of Supplies to answer the warrants drawn by Congress, which may be attended with dangerous consequences. Commissioners are arrived from Maryland to attend the convention, to consider of a limitation of prices. I was informed Some weeks ago by one of the Delegates of that State, that the Assembly had passed a law for the limitation of prices & he Shewed me an abstract of the Act, but it proves to be a mistake. A Bill was prepared but not enacted into a Law-and the Assembly is adjourned till March next. We hear nothing from Virginia or Delaware respecting that measure-nor do I learn that any persons are appointed by Massachusetts bay or Rhode Island to meet in Convention.

Laments the \""present distressing Aspect of our publick affairs.... On the Subtile Subject of finance my pretentions are truly Small, but on the necessity of some different measures from any yet adopted what man can Shut his eyes? To say nothing of the various aireal Schemes that have been thrown out, one thing is clear, that even such as have been tryed from their Shew of more reason and Solidity, either from their being inadequate in their nature, or too late in their application have palpably failed of the effect. For Some time past we have resembled a Patient far gon[e] in disease, given up of his Physicians and left to the mere efforts of nature. Now whether we Shall proceed in the same natural or rather slothful and timid way, leaving our internal commerce to regulate itself, and take chance for the event, or attempt the plain highway of Law & publick Authority, in the regulation of Prices generally, appears to be the Question, and that without an alternative that can promise Success. The latter however degraded by Merchants or exploded by some politicians of more refined Sentiments if I have any Opinion at all, is the better if not the only fundamental means of our political recovery. I know there are powerful Objections to this doctrine of regulation of prices by law, or rather they are powerfully made, for at this time I must in truth declare I think their whole operation impertinent, inconclusive & lost in the Superior force of these arguments which inevitably result from the present circumstances of this country, whereby the great Law of Necessity is now clearly introduced for the tryal of a legal regulation of Prices, and must at least fully justify the experiment. I know the grand difficulties, as well as the nicities attending Such regulations must lie in the execution, and penalties of this Law-hard they may be but ought not to be supposed insurmountable. True the virtue of the populace is very low but not altogether extinct, the latent remains whereof must yet instrumentally Save us, if so, how are we to animate these remains, when the natural Springs thereof are so much relaxed-No other probable or perhaps possible way but by the Salutary Stimulace of publick authority, and the encouragement they may derive from a near prospect of Peace, or at least of retrenching the extra expences of the Civil Staff of the Army, which wou'd naturally lead to Some farther Observation, I mean such as arises on the remarks, Sentiments and temper of many people far out of your Sight and hearing.... \""[P.S.] I cou'd sincerely wish the policy of Virginia respecting their Land-Office and extent of territory were otherwise timed-and more disinterested.\"" ""

I would have you send all forward to our Friend, unless you should have found that I really committed the Error of sending you before both Mr. A's H & my owne.

But as you see above I have altered the Conjecture. How do you do, Lovely Portia, these very cold Days? Mistake me not willfully; I said Days. For my Part, I was hardly able to write legibly at the Distance of only 18 feet from two Fire Places in the Congress Room at 4 oClock this afternoon. There is no Probability that the Cold will be decreased in 7 hours from that Time. I will strive however to refrain from coveting my Neighbour's Blankets. I shall find that not difficult.

In the Month of June last a Gentleman belonging to the Chamber of Accounts at the Treasury was appointed and comissioned to repair to Albemarle in the State of Virginia in Order to liquidate and receive Payment of the Accounts of the United States against the Troops of the Convention of Saratoga, which are become very considerable.(1) He did not succeed in his Mission, Major General Phillips, seniour Officer of the said Troops, alledging that he was not in Cash, but that, if he were, he did not consider himself as invested with competent Authority to order the Payment either in Money or Articles in Kind. Among the Papers delivered in by the Commissioner on his return we find also a Number of Exceptions taken to the Mode of stating such Part of the Accounts as fall in the Line of the Quarter Master General's Department, because the Supplies for the Troops of Convention were blended with those of the Guards, and the Proportion struck according to the comparative Numbers . On the report of the Commissioner, Congress have passed a Number of Resolutions a Copy of Part of which is enclosed; and in Consequence it becomes our Duty to take Measures for pursuing this interesting Object.(2) We shall therefore appoint and impower a suitable Person or Persons to complete this Business agreeably to the Intentions of the said Resolutions, and will be indebted to you for every Assistance you can give.

8335,dg014405,1780,Board of Treasury to George Washington,"""Board of Treasury to George Washington   Sir, Treasury-Office Philadelphia, 14 January 1780 By your Excellency's Letter to Congress of the 4th instant(1) we are happy to be made acquainted that Proposals for an Exchange of Prisoners, by the Commanders in Chief of the American and British Armies, are in the Way of being opened. How far the Subject on which we now trouble Your Excellency may be involved, or ought to be thought of previous to or in any Discussion of this Matter, we cannot precisely determine, but conceive it our Duty thus early to mention it. At the same Time declaring that Nothing would tempt us to throw an unnecessary Obstruction in the Course of so desireable an Event. In the Month of June last a Gentleman of the Chamber of Accounts at this Office, was appointed and commissioned to repair to Albemarle, in the State of Virginia, with proper Instructions and Powers to Liquidate and receive Payment of the Accounts of the United States against the Troops of the Convention of Saratoga. After much Correspondence, Conference and Explanation with Major General Phillips, seniour Officer of the said Troops, he has returned without effecting any Thing, though from the Documents produced, we are convinced he has left no proper Means unessayed to compass the End of his Mission. On considering his report Congress have passed certain Resolutions, a Copy of which your Excellency has enclosed.(2) It is now become our Duty to take Measures for carrying the Determinations they contain, so far as we are directed to take Order on them, into Effect. In this, as we shall need so we wish to have all the Countenance and Assistance your Excellency's Attention to other pressing and indispensible Business will allow you to give us. The Accounts amount to a very considerable Sum, as nearly as we can judge, if those not yet collected are added to these prepared, not less than two Hundred Thousand Pounds in Specie, and we look upon the Settlement and Discharge of them as an Object of such Magnitude and JANUARY 14, 1780  national Concern, that we are unwilling the British Government or their Officers, should be in a Situation to venture a peremptory Refusal. The Difficulty also with which we procure Specie, absolutely necessary to be obtained for some Uses, prompts us to avail ourselves of this Resource for at least the Balance due for what can not be repaid in Kind, and for the Whole, if the Enemy chuse to repay no Part in that Way. But above all the Payment is to be expected as a Piece of Justice demandible on the Part of the United States to whom the Money is, and has long been, due for value received. The Accounts against these Troops, previous to the Departure of General Burgoyne for England, or as far as they were collected and prepared at that Time, were paid off. The subsequent are founded on no new Principles, and it is therefore to be hoped that no further Hesitations on the Part of the Enemy will take Place. Major General Phillips's Objections were principally that he was not in Cash, but that if he were his Authority was incompetent. Some less capital Objections were also made against the Mode of stating such of the Accounts as came in the Line of the Quarter Master General's Department. The Matter perhaps may now be accomodated, and we earnestly hope it will never be necessary to carry the Penalty of a Refusal in any Degree into Execution. If the Accounts now prepared and ready for Settlement are accepted and discharged, it is to be supposed that those due and not yet collected would be admitted on the like Ground when ready. The Amount of these is not inconsiderable, and we are not advised how far a Stipulation to discharge them when collected and adjusted would be necessary previous to a Release of the Prisoners, were the Exchange to extend to a large Proportion of them. We shall, with all convenient Dispatch commission and instruct a proper Person to go forward and transact this Business as an Accountant, to whom we should be happy if your Excellency would join some active and intelligent Assistant from the Army, acquainted with the Train of Business in the Commissary, Quarter Master and other Departments to which the Accounts belong, and capable of conducting such a Matter with suitable Influence and Address. If your Excellency approves this Idea, we wish your early Notice, and the Name of the Gentleman you would appoint, that we may join him in the Commission and give him concurrent Authority with the Person appointed from hence. Whatever Your Excellency may have Leisure to suggest will be of great use to us in the Conduct of this Affair.(3) We have the Honour to be, your Excellency's most obedt, most hble Servt.

Four american Colonels, Magau, Ely &c are out from New York on short parole, with propositions drawn up by them & General Philips of the Convention troops, for a general exchange of prisoners; which bids fair to take place on the plan now proposed. It is referred by Congress to Genl. Washington, with power to take measures thereon at his discretion.(1) Much credit is due & given to Connecticut for the supply of Beef said to be coming on from thence to the Army, whose distress has been great & situation yet remains critical for want of provisions. Eight dollars have been given in its vicinity by the Soldiers for a quart of meal & half a dollar for an ear of Corn. Flour & Grain are procured sufficient it is said for some months & now forwarding as fast as may be-& every attention will in future be paid to furnish money for the beef department. The failure of that great resource the press, gives as was expectable a violent Shock, but it is hoped will prove a salutary one. The System of taxation urged by necessity is now establishing itself fast. All the States in the Union, so far as I can be informed are now Levying & collecting pursuant to the requisitions of Congress-tho' in some of them their assemblies have not yet been together to consider of the Quotas last required. Maryland Assembly has indeed lately been together & adjourned without making provision therefor-owing to their not being able to obtain a vote in the Senate for the Sale of British & Tory property-but as they have called on their people at large to shew their sense on that question & are soon to meet again there is no doubt of that obstacle's being removed & that Maryland will chearfully & fully furnish her quota.

I believe you had not then recieved my last, in which I mentioned some Rooms which I cou'd get for your Accommodation here, the Owner wishes to know your Answer, which I cannot give untill I know your Determination-& tho' you say you have Doubts whether you will enter upon the arduous Task, yet I think that Point must have been long settled with you, or you wou'd have told the Legislature so before they rose, when they had it in their Power to fill up the Vacancy. Forbes declares, & says he has written so to the Governor, that he will stay no longer than the End of this Month,(2) if so it will be indispensably necessary for some of the new to come up, or the State will be unrepresented, how pleasing this may be to our Constituents I submit to your Judgment. Congress has resolved to leave Philadelphia in April next, but when is not yet determined, perhaps the Uncertainty of being properly, or so well, accommodated in any other Place, may be a Mean of their continuing here-but this I do not positively say-was it left to me, I shou'd, thinking it necessary, remove tomorrow, if practicable. Flour is now conveyed with much Facility on Slays, & some has arrived here from Maryland & gone on to Camp. The Depth of the Snow prevented Cattle from being driven, & reduced our poor brave Soldiers to an Hering & Gill of Rice per Day, this they bore without murmuring. The Exertion of the States (upon which we must now solely depend) & the Roads being opened now, afford a Prospect of Subsistance to the Army, & I hope a little Perseverance in this Line of Conduct will fill our Magazines against the ensuing Campaign. Your recommendations will ever have great Weight with me, because I know you wou'd not recommend a bad Man, & I shou'd be happy to prove it by my Endeavour to promote Mr. Grayson, whom I view as a good Officer & skillful Mariner. But I must inform you that we have more Captains than Ships, our Marine being but in its Infancy. Many of these Captains, deserving in the highest Degree, are now obliged to go in Merchantmen to get a living. It will never do to put a Man over their Heads. The Enemy certainly sailed from N York on 26th Decr. with five thousand Troops, & I have great Reason to think Clinton with them, where destined we know not, but 'tis most generally thought to Georgia & Charles Town. Since their sailing there have been two severe Storms, from JANUARY 21, 1780  Portrait of George Plater  the good Effects of which we have much to hope. Since my Arrival here I have received another Letter from Mr. Chamberlaine (3) concerning the Land, I wrote him (4) that I had applied to you for your Determination, & then wou'd give him my Answer, which I wish to be enabled to do in a Post or two, the Weather may possibly prevent your going to the eastern Shore for some Time, & my Delay may be deemed by him neither candid or polite-therefore shall be glad you will say whether you will purchase or not. The Disposal of the Land at Wye is what I have not thought of, the Right not being fully in me, but shou'd such a thing happen, you may be assured it wou'd give me more Pleasure to vest it in you than a Stranger, nor can the mention be by any Means deemed offensive, well knowing that you intended none. I find it is my Fate to be detained here this Winter, very disagreable to me, & inconvenient to my domestic Affairs-I presume Mr. Hall (5) cannot think of leaving the Vineyard & Bub 'till warm weather gives Motion to Butterflies &c. The Weather is cold, but all agree, who have travelled, that the Roads are very dry & good, perhaps better than you may find 'em in April. Therefore it wou'd give me Pleasure to see you here.

8353,dg014423,1780,Ezra L Hommedieu to George Clinton,"""Ezra L'Hommedieu to George Clinton   Sr Philadelphia January 21, 1780 As I understand one great object the Legislature of our State had in view, in meeting at so early a day, was to carry into Execution The Resolution of Congress recommending a general limitation of Prices in the different States, I think it necessary to inform you, that at present I see no probability of its being speedily adopted by the states in general. The States of New Hampshire, Connecticut, New Jersey, Pensylvania, Delaware & Maryland, have sent Agents or Commissioners to this place (many of whom are their Delegates in Congress) to meet the Agents from the other States, in pursuance of the Recommendation of the Convention that met at Hartford; they have adjoined [adjourned] from Time to Time, without doing any Business, and are waiting expecting to hear from Virginia, who they are informed has apointed Agents to meet; and from the Massachusetts, from whom no Accounts have been received respecting this Business; Should this State or any other of Consequence refuse to join in the general Regulation proposed, it would much discourage the other States. Connecticut will not pass the law, except Massachusetts does the same, Maryland & Pensylvania are so connected with Virginia, that they cannot inforce such Laws except she joins in Similar Measures. I do not expect the States in general will pass the necessary Laws for the Limitation of Prices except conditionally till they know the result of this Meeting. I do not know that it would answer any valuable purpose for New York to send or impower agents to meet this Convention, as they have no Doubt of the States adopting the Measure if it should be general. New Jersey have passed the Law without any Reserve, at the same Time, they empowered Agents to buy the produce in the state, who likely before the act takes place, will buy up most of their Produce at the present going Prices there. Wheat for Instance at 50 Dollars per Bushel. Their Assembly are adjoined to meet at an early Day after the Act shall take place, so that they run little or no risk in proceeding in the Manner they have done. I shall be informed of the Deliberations & proceedings of this Convention and shall give you information thereof. The Distresses of the Army for want of Provisions has been very alarming, Occasioned for the want of Money to purchase; the Necessary Consequence of the prices being stopped & the extraordinary  JANUARY 21, 1780  Depreciation of Money, so that the Treasury was almost exhausted, the purchasors greatly in debt and out of Credit, before any Money could be procured from the States for Taxes. Bills on Spain and Holland are now issued, some of which will be sent to our State. This will give a Temporary relief. Maryland & Delaware being called on have procured a considerable Quantity of Flower, but except the prices can by some means be reduced, or Our Money fixed at some certain Rate I fear it will be with the greatest Difficulty that Supplies for the Army can be procured for the next Campaign. It is under Consideration to call on the several States for to furnish equal Quotas of Produce & other Necessaries for the Army & support of the war at certain prices to be credited to each State & to be paid for by them out of their Taxes. I am informed that Mr Shearman & some other Eastern Delegates have received information from the New Hampshire Grants [that] they are determined not to submit to the Decision [of Con]gress, their Claim to Independance; but have [named] Agents to send to Congress, with offers to confederate with the United States, or such of them as are willing to confederate with Vermont.(1) I have great reason to believe that great pains will be taken by some of the States (perhaps not openly) to put of[f] the Tryal & prevent any Determination respecting those Lands at present. They are continually strengthening themselves in the Eastern States by selling Lands but I trust Congress will see the necessity of immediately hearing and determining a Controversy of so great Importance as well to the United States as to New York.

(1) The peculiar interest which our Country has in some part of it determined us to give the earliest advice in our power to you her presiding Magistrate, relying on your vigilance for every thing that can possibly be done to frustrate the designs of the Enemy. We flatter ourselves that a strict attention even to the most minute movements of the disaffected, which we know you will cause to be kept up will prevent the advantages, which they hope for from that ill judging class of our Citizens, and from our Negroes-and should they attempt to invade or penetrate any part of our Country, we have no doubt of hearing, that the vigor and valor of our people, will be exerted against them with decisive success. But we can not help wishing that the scene of action may be forever removed from our own state-and that the Enemy may be met in their most distant approach by a force sufficient to give them an Effectual Check. Our apprehensions on the Article of Arms made us enquire if any succours of that kind could be sent, from this place, but we can derive no hope from the result. Virginia has lately had an acquisition of five thousand stand and we doubt not she will assist us if we shall be eminently threatened.(2) It would give us great satisfaction to learn that the long expected supplies of this kind are arrived for we should have no fears from such a force as the enemy can employ against our particular state if the militia were completely armed. The Virginia line which is on its march, to reinforce the southern army, will be, we hope at least time enough to come to the relief of Charlestown should it be invested, at all events to check them in their approach to our Country.

Discusses a new Pennsylvania militia act and the merits of corporal and capital punishment. Apologizes for his limited knowledge of \""that Subtile Science of Finance,\"" but expresses unwillingness to leave \""the deplorable state of our publick affairs...to a mere course of nature-As a Vesel deserted of her Crew, or a patient of his physicians. The means that in my Opinion appear the most proper for our recovery and deliverance, are Simply these-1st. a Regulation of Prices by Law. 2d A Speedy reformation of abuses, and retrenchment of Expences in the two great lines of the Civil Staff, and some other appendages of the Army, more immediately under the direction of the Board of War. Whether this last shou'd extend to the line Military, the General will best judge, but unless there are officers supernumerary the line cannot be touched. 3d. the laying in of certain Quantitys of Grain into publick Magazines, or particular Mills appointed for the purpose. The Millars for the sake of the Tole, I presume wou'd readily find Granaries; this grain to be laid in at the regulated price, either in part or whole of the Owners Tax, allowing him a moderate Mileage for Carriage. The first of these I call, the basis of every thing Salutay--the mode is at  JANUARY 24, 1780  once, regular virtuous & necessary, and at present perfectly consistant with the Spirit of good Government-diametrically opposite therefore must the temper of that man be, who wou'd resist or evade such a Law. However arduous the Execution of this regulating law may be found to be, I humbly presume the necessity and expedience of it, must to every candid Observer be as evident as the noonday Sun, and this necessity must at least justify the Experiment. To Say that such a law is at no time practicable, is paying an odious Compliment both to God & Man; to him who hath the hearts of all men in his hand, the Original institutor & approver of all lawfull means, in the use whereof he may be said to Superintend the generallity of human affairs-to our Countrymen and fellow Citizens, as tho' their love of Nominal or even a little real superfluous wealth shoud lead them headlong to political destruction or that they Shou'd be found incapable of Society and the blessings thereof, by a lawless and refractory dispossion rending asunder it's most Salutary bonds! forbid this Almighty God, the author of Order, of human nature itself, and giver of every good & perfect gift. The Hacknied Maxim, that Trade Must alwais Regulate itself, Is in our Situation as impolitick as it is arrogant and absurd, and patience but scarcely restrains from bestowing upon it the severer epithets due to a possition so very ill-timed. Amongst the Aerial or more refined schemes of Finance which have been exhibited most whereof must be considered as so many phantoms, it's said there is one lately Suggested by a Mr. Usher from Maryland,(1) which with the embroidery of a Loan to the publick of fifty millions of Dollars & a considerable sum in specie, I confess puts on a glittering aspect-having had but a cursory & perhaps an imperfect relation of that Gentlemans Scheme, the least we can say is that it's well Ushered in & perhaps with a good designe-but as it contains an antidote only to One branch of our disease, Speculation or private monopoly, we must doubt the effect like its cause wou'd only be partial-And the articles of commerce limited to certain Companys however large & free, might one day produce as boisterous a noise on our shores as the rising tides whereby they are introduced. The plain high way of publick authority for America Wise & just Regulations by Law-Loping off every excrecence and superfluous branch in our several departments-persevering, but moderate Taxation, Such as every taxable may obviously bear- Honest Loans, justly if not generously requesting the lender whether he lent sooner or later in this conflict, but expecially those who have advanced or shall advance their Money in the publicks extreamity. These Measures together with the plain lines of ceconomy & good government, will by the divine blessing which on the American cause we can never doubt (if we exclude it not by inattention or wicked works) will recover our finances-replenish our Treasury, support our Army and ensure the establishment of American liberty.\"" JANUARY 24 1780  Laments the recent degeneration of public virtue but concludes nevertheless that \""our people at large will yeild to a wise & equal regulation of prices & labour by law, as the basis of every other improvement in our affairs & of our political safety.\"" On the other hand, \""taxation must be mitigated\"" because of the present severe weather. \""The people will pay tax willingly as they can bear it, but must have time; and on this condition also, that a reformation of abuses & curtail[ment] of the publick expence as Suddenly take place as the nature of things will admit-which reformation farther than the Outlines cannot possibly be performed by the General & assistants but ultimately & minutely by the Several States, and in their respective Counties.... My good friend Mr. McLane James McLene] writes me his doubts of the propriety of a regulation of prices, as among other considerations he doubts whether the people wou'd bear such regulation & their high Tax, at the Same time. The matter admits of no doubt, they wou'd not, nor will they bear taxation as at present projected whether a regulation take place or not, but if it shou'd there will not be the same necessity for a high Tax, and the lower it can with safety be made, will have a powerful tendancy to facilitate the Operation of the regulating Law.

They accordingly adjourned without day.(2) Despair not however of the currency's receiving a fixedness & Justice being done. In my next I will write you more particular on this Subject.

8368,dg014438,1780,Oliver Ellsworth to Thomas Mumford,"""Oliver Ellsworth to Thomas Mumford   Dear sir, Philada. Jany. 25. 1780. I thank you for your Letter of the 1t of Instt. recd. yesterday-& the order you have been pleased to give Mr Breed to deliver me a Barrel of Sugar, which I shall avail my self of with proper sentiments JANUARY 25, 1780  of your disposition to oblige me & wish you to direct the Post to call on Mrs. Ellsworth & receive such pay therefor as you shall name to do your self justice. Congress have no very special intelligence from Europe of late; all things however on that side the water continue to look favourable & flattering to American Independance. It is doubtless in Europe a winter of negotiation & I shall be as happy as you should the result be an honorable peace to America in the Spring. As to a foreign Loan Congress have good reason to expect that a small one at least will be negotiated in Holland if not in Spain by the persons they have appointed & authorised thereto. Which if obtained I think it more probable that the money will be funded there & bills drawn thereon rather than that much if any of it will be imported in specie-but this is my own conjecture. A few Bills are now offered by Congress for Sale at 25 dollrs. for 4/6 Sterlg. an equal sum to the purchase money to be at the same lent the Continent on loan office certificates. The Bills I have no doubt will be honored, tho' I confess I do not like the terms of sale. If you incline to purchase you may doubtless soon be supplied at the Treasury office in Hartford. French Bills here are at 30 for 1 in dollars-& hard money at 38. Measures are in contemplation which may perhaps fix the medium. The general talk this way on the Subject within doors & without is \""do ample justice to the holders of the Bills & certificates as far as the nature of the case will admit.\"" If hereafter it shall at any time be in my power to give you any useful or important information, duty & inclination will prompt me to it. I have not yet had the pleasure of seing Capt. Saltonstal whome you are pleased to name to me; but had other motives sufficient if you had added none to interest me particulary in wishing him a fair & impartial enquiry & I doubt not of his having it. The Convention that was proposed to be held at this Place on the subject of a Limitation of prices, being attended only from N. Hampshire, Connecticut, N Jersey, Pensylvania, Delaware & Maryland-they did not think proper to proceed to business. There is very little probability now I think of such a measures taking place & am led to hope that the strenuous exertions of the States in taxes which they seem well disposed to, in conjunction with other regulations that may take place will in a great measure superceed the necessity of it. You will be pleased to know that greater Unanimity has at no time prevailed in Congress & that the embarrasments you will easily conceive must attend them, does but strenthen their reliance on the exertions of America, & that good providence that has conducted us thus far.

I should have been glad to have seen your Remarks on the anonymous Letter, but Mr Lovell informs me, he has not yet received them. (1) The Policy of America will succeed or fail in my Opinion, in proportion to her Exertions for establishing a Navy. I well remember that You was the first to promote it, & altho it was disapproved by some in Point of Time, the Benefit derived from the Measure has clearly manifested the Wisdom of it. The State of our Finances will check it's present Growth, but I doubt not that it will soon flourish, & that Time will suggest Improvements in the Arrangements & Regulations of the Boards that are appointed to cherish & conduct it. I am very sensible that the officers of these Departments have been poorly rewarded, & was lately of a Committee who reported that their present Salaries should have a Retrospect to Novr. 1778, but the Subject is not yet considered by Congress. I think however that You have their fullest Confidence. Congress have not yet determined whether to remove eastward or southward; both are talked of, but your Remarks respecting the Navy are conclusive in my Mind, in Favour of the former. The great objects of Attention in Congress are OEconomy & Resources. Necessity dictates their Measures, & I hope will produce salutary Effects. The Departments of the Muster & Barrack Masters are abolished & the Business of the former annexed to the Office of Inspectors. Generals Schuyler & Mifflin & Colo Pickering are appointed a Committee with full Powers to inform themselves by Inspection or otherwise of the State of the Staff Departments, to call in any of the Officers thereof for Information, to discharge all persons therein that are supernumerary or delinquent, to break up unnecessary issuing Posts, & establish others were requisite, to stop all Issues of Rations not indispensibly necessary for the Service, & in Conjunction with General Washington to reduce the Number of Horses & Waggons in the Service & Expence of Transportation, & to adopt a general Reformation of the Departments. The States are to be also called on for their respective quotas of Supplies, & authorized to stop all purchases by continental officers, when Measures are adopted for complying with the Requisitions of Congress; & to induce the States to purchase cheap they are to be credited equal prices for JANUARY 25, 1780  Articles of the same Kind & Quality, & in proportion for other Articles. I inclose You the News papers containing three sensible Letters by a Gentleman in Maryland on \""Appreciation\"",(2) & can give You nothing new, excepting certain Information from the Court of France that by their Interposition the british Court have failed in their Applications for Recruits to the several Powers of Germany. The Massachusetts Delegates are sitting in Congress by Virtue of a Certificate of their Appointment from the Deputy Secretary. They have never aspired to be commissioned, but wish not to loose their Rank as warrant officers. I observe your Apprehensions relative to a new QMG but have no Reason to suppose them well founded, altho the Matter has been suggested in Congress.

None of the States have as we are informed yet adopted a limitation except New Jersey, & it is now become impracticable for several of them to do it by the time recommended by Congress, their assemblies Standing adjourned to a later day.

I have sounded many members about it. Some I find extreamly well disposed to the measure while others again receive it with more coolness rather on account of the novelty of the Institution than from any other motives tho' perhaps the dismissal of Gen Lee which makes the rank you claim the more important may have some influence on their minds. But this last consideration is so much less weighty than the first, that I am persuaded if you would accept Greens place (2) which he wishes to [qu]it that you may have it on your own terms. What I would particularly mention to you is my [earn]est wish that you will comply with the request contained in the resolutions of Congress transmitted to you [by] the President,(3) they apply to you as a member of Congress who are capable of extricating your country from the ruin that threatens it. Should you suffer any personal considerations to interpose or prevent your affording the assistance they request when you act not as their servant but as one of their body, You will offer room to your enimies to alledge that private convenience more than publick reasons have influenced your past conduct. Your Friends will be disappointed & hurt, And a measure which they have so much at heart (to which [they] consider this as preparatory) be entirely defeated. Let me therefore intreat you not only to accept the commission but to do it immediately & without reluctance. The publick requires it of you. And shd. your endeavours be crowned with success which they can not fail in some sort to be you will acquire more reputation than you or any other person could possibly attain in any other station or upon any other occasion. I can not enlarge (as I fear I have already missed the post) but just so far as to tell you that we have not yet determined where to move to, that question being put off to the 1st of February.(4) Our Affairs are as much deranged as ever, our finance far from being restored- and our army living from hand to mouth. When we shall get thro' these perplexities I know not. I shall however contribute my mite tho' not I fear [with] the fairest prospect of success. The fleet which left New York last Month has not yet been heard of. The Cold continues so intense that the Chesapeak bay is froze over. We have a report that St. Augustine & Pensacola are taken by the Spaniards & that Genl. Prevost has left Savannah.

I Recd. your favour of the 6th Instant, two Days Since, and am Sorry to Learn, that the part of our Army on the North River are under Such Distressed Circumstances.(1) I was in hopes that those Difficulties did not Extend further, in any Great Degree, than to the Troops in New Jersey. I am however happy to Inform you that the Roads Since the Snow has fallen, is much Better than before, which has facilitated the Transportation of provision to the Army at head Quarters, in Such a Manner, that with the Great Exertions of the State of New Jersey they are amply Relived for the present; and if the Roads Should  JANUARY 28, 1780  Continue as they Now Are for a few Weeks, I hope they will Obtain a Considerable Supply. The Embarkation of General Clintons troops at New York with himself, and it is Said Cornwallace, left the hook two Days before the violent Storm. But we have not heard of them Since; Though We hope providence has Disposed of them to our Advantage. Congress has for More than A Year had under their Consideration A plan, for Establishing A Court of Appeals in all Cases of Capture and Much time has been Spent upon it. They have at last finished it and Appointed their Judges. The Gentlemen Appointed are, Mr. Wythe of Virginia, Mr. Paca, of Mariland, and Mr. Hosmer of Connecticut. They are to begin their Courts at this place and they have it in their power to Adjourn to any place between Williamsburgh and Hartford, having an Eye to the Number of Causes that are or may be brought up to them. In order to Correct abuses and Retrench our Expences, Congress have appointed Commissioners with Ample and Sufficient powers, over the whole Staff Department of our Army. The Gentlemen Appointed are General Schuyler, General Mifflin, and Mr. Pickering, who is now a member of the Board of war. If those Gentlemen will undertake this Business (and I hope they will not Refuse) they may Save Some Millions to this Continent and Render their Country Most Essential Service. In my Letter Some time Since to the President of the Senate,(2) I gave it as my Opinion that a Regulation of Prizes in the Several States from Virginia Northward would take place. I founded my Opinion on an Information of the Delagates from Maryland that their State had passed a Law for the purpose a Copy of which they had Recd. (But I now understand it was only a Bill under the Consideration of their Legislature And which Did not pass at their last Session). New Jersey had passed a Law for that purpose. These, with what I expected from the Convention which was to meet on that Business at this place were the Reasons for that Opinion, But as the matter Now appears I am very Doubtfull whether there will be a General Regulation or not. As the Meeting of that Convention was not General, No Deputies from Virginia And those from Massachusetts and Rhode Island did not Arrive untill the Members that were met had Adjourned without Comeing to any Resolutions; But Since the Arrival of the Eastern Members I understand they have formed their Convention again and are now Consulting what is proper for them to Do Without Virginia, or New York, Though I believe they have no great Doubt that our State would come into any Measures of that kind provided all the Other States Should Do it. For five Weeks past we have had the Severest Cold here, that has been known for that Length of time (as the people of this City Say) Since the Year 40.

Since the Letter Mr Sherman & myself did ourselves the honor of addressing to your Excellency by the last post,(1) a commissioner has arived from Massachusetts to attend the Convention for a limitation of prices,(2) which had adjourned sine die-also a Commission from Rhode Island to their Delegate in Congress to the same purpose.(3) Upon which the Assembly of Pensylvania to whom their Commissioners had made report, have reappointed others, to meet again (4)-& a meeting has been thereupon had from Commissioners of all the States who attended before, except New Jersey, with the addition of Massachusetts & Rhode Island, at which also the delegates in Con- JANUARY 30, 1780  gress from N. York attended, tho' not specially authorised & gave assurance that their State would abide the measures that might be come into. The Convention having again formed now stands adjourned to Wednesday next, for N Jersey Commissioners who are sent to, to come in-the result of which meeting will perhaps be a further adjournment to a distant day to give Virginia, who has not yet done it, oppertunity to appoint & send commissioners. It does not appear indeed what more can well be done at this time as some of the Commissioners present are not authorised to do any thing unless the Convention should be attended from all the States first proposed. In return for Lord Sterlings late Expedition to Staten Island, a party of the Enemy consisting of one hundred horse & four hundred foot, last week surprised the out guards at Elizabeth Town & Newark & made four officers & about Sixty men prisoners, & burned some publick buildings at both places. The supplies & prospects of the Army are now comfortable. The General was reduced to the necessity of demanding from the Several Counties in N Jersey specifeck supplies, which with much spirit they complyed with even beyond the requisition. Maryland is said also to have fully complyed with the requisition of Congress to that State for 15,000 barrels of Flour. Delaware has also exerted herself much in the same way. The Assembly of this State are now together & seem disposed to furnish the 50,000 barrels of Flour requested of them as also to go into such further specifick supplies as may be necessary.(5) South Carolina, justly apprehensive of her danger, is arming three Regiments of blacks. It is highly probable, unless the Embarkation from New York should have blown to the West Indies or suffered much in the Storm, that we shall soon hear of an Attack on Charlestown-tho' I trust there will be a defence sufficient at least to render it a serious one. The Town scituated on a Neck less than one mile across & not commanded by heights is defensible & well fortified on the land side-the entrance of the Harbour being very narrow is secured by a number of Frigates, which are the largest Ships that can come over the bar without taking out their Guns. Continental troops and Militia are now marching southward but may not arive in season for the Enemy's first attempts. That policy which has long since directed the Enemy to carry their operations & efforts southward seems now to be attending to & there is much reason to expect that the active part of the next campaign will be in that quarter. I take the liberty to mention to your Excellency that the Scituation of my affairs renders it necessary for me to return home by the begining of March, & to express my wishes that some of the Gentlemen on the new election may find it convenient to take their Seats in Congress by that time.

8391,dg014461,1780,William Churchill Houston to John Jay,"""William Churchill Houston to John Jay   Sir, Philada. 7 February 1780. It is not simply from being a Member of the Committee of Foreign Affairs that I take the Liberty of troubling you; my Curiosity to have Access to all the Sources of Knowledge in publick affairs, is a further Apology. For this I confess I have a boundless Thirst and Eagerness. A Vessel, lately arrived to the Eastward, reports to have spoken with the Confederacy on the Coast of France, and I indulge myself with the Confidence that you are safely arrived there, and have also reached the last Stage of your Destination: for your Success at which it must be the Inclination, Interest and Duty of every good American to pray. The general Complection of Affairs here is favourable. The Subject of Finance constitutes our principal, if not only, Embarrassment. To this, I know, your early Attention will be turned, and, it is to be hoped, strenuous Efforts at Home, with the Assistance of our Friends abroad, will in a little Time surmount it. No military Event of much Notice has taken Place since the unsuccessful Attempt upon Savanna in Georgia by the allied Forces under Count D'Estaing and General Lincoln, in which we were so unfortunate as to lose the gallant Count Pulaski, with other brave Officers and a Number of Men.  FEBRUARY 7, 1780  From this however the Enemy have not derived any Advantage besides keeping Possession of the Town and a small Scope around it, for they have not occupied one other Post more interiour in that Country. I believe they Suffered severely. By Dispatches, dated 23 December last, from Augusta, the present Capital of Georgia, and received the 3d instant we are informed that the Government of the State, for some Time dormant or rather annihilated, is again organized and in Operation. (1) George Walton, Esqr. I think formerly known to you, is Governour; the legislative and Executive are in plenary Exercise of their Several Duties; and Delegates are appointed to Congress, though not yet arrived here. The Sentiments of the People are resolute and decided; Measures are taken to recruit their Troops, and the Conclusion of their Letter to Congress is, that \""in the Fall and wreck of the Union only, and total Extirpation of their State, will they fall and perish.\"" A large Embarkation took Place at New York about Christmas, said to be six or eight Thousand confidently reported and believed to be destined to the Southward. Sir Henry Clinton and Lord Cornwallis have both sailed, and General Knyphausen commands in New-York. This is the Intelligence, but whether Sir Henry is gone with the Troops or to Europe is not ascertained, nor have we heard any Thing of the Fleet since it sailed. Many suppose that the Weather which was uncommonly stormy for some Time after their Departure, must have altered their Course by the West-Indies. To put the Southern Army in Condition to oppose so formidable a Force, the whole North Carolina and Virginia Troops have been detached from hence, and Bodies of Militia called in the Southern Country. The Arrival of these Succours as soon as was calculated and as early as they may be wanted is a Matter of some Doubt from the extraordinary and continuing Rigour of the Winter. It is clear the Enemy mean to bend a pointed Effort against the Southern States, and if possible to pare us down by trying this Extreme; but, I hope, they will find other Use for their Time and Hardihood than plundering and desolating the Country, as in multiplied Instances they have heretofore done. Accounts from the Floridas, which seem to wear every Mark of Credibility, except that they do not come through the official Line of Communication, say that the Forces of His Catholick Majesty are in Possession of the Town and Garrison of Pensacola, and that Operations against St Augustine are well forward. Land-passage being at this Time extremely scarce, difficult and tedious, you will probably have pretty near as early authentick Intelligence in Europe, as we here. As to Navigation, the Delaware has been shut up since the 20th December last, and a Passage for loaded Waggons more than a Month. The News, if true, will draw deep in our Favour. The Main Army is hutted for the Winter in the vicinity of Morriston in New Jersey: a strong Garrison under the Orders of General MacDougall is at West point. General Heath commands the Posts at  the Highlands; and a small Garrison occupies Rhode Island since it was evacuated by the Enemy. The Papers sent by the Committee of foreign Affairs will give you the other current News. Governour Livingston and Family are well by Letters lately from him. The Vermont Business just come on. My best Compliments to Mrs Jay, and believe me your Excellency's most obedt Servant, Wm Ch Houston ""

The Grant they have been pleased to make me is very acceptable and claims my Acknowledgement. The vigorous exertions of the State of New Jersey to provide for the late Necessities of the Army are such as have done much honour to the Magistrates & Inhabitants of that State, and provided a plentiful temporary supply.(1) I may with propriety acquaint your Excellency with reason to expect that the plan of operation for the ensuing Campaign will be on the part of our Ally, as should call forth our most vigorous Exertions & Cooperations to expell the Enemy from the United States and put a period to the War. The Measures adopted by Congress for recruiting the Army for the next Campaign allready too long delayed will be forwarded in a few Days and I hope may reach you before the Assembly rises.(2) We have undoubted Intelligence that an Expedition against Pensacola was forming at the Havannah, the last fall, and have recent Accounts & reports that they are now in possesion of that place & have made the Garrison prisoners consisting of about Nine hundred Men but of this Success we have no official Intelligence. An Express is Just arrived from Georgia which brings the above report respecting Pensacola but knows not how the Intelligence arrived there though the Capture of the place was publicly talked of there. By this Express we received letters from the Governor & Assembly in Georgia assuring us they meant to defend themselves and support the common Cause to their utmost. We can as yet obtain no Intelligence of the British fleet which sailed from New York the 26 of Decemr, supposed to be destined for South Carolina or Georgia, & begin to hope that Providence has directed them to depart the Coast. The Severity of the frost in these  FEBRUARY 7, 1780  parts and as far Southward as I have heard is greater than hath been known these forty Years. I have the honour to be, with every sentiment of respect, your Excellency's hble Servt, Sam. Huntington Feby 8 Another Express is Just arrived from Genl Lincoln. The following is an Extract from the Generals Letter dated Charles Town S. Carolina, Decemr 22, 1779.(3) \""Before this reaches you, you will doubtless hear that the Spaniards have been up the river Mississippi and possessed themselves of the English Settlements on that River and that they made nine hundred prisoners, That about the Beginning of this month they [left] Havannah with a Respectable Fleet with Troops for Pensacola or Augustine,[....]\"" Yours ut supra, S.

The affair of Bradford is frequently agitated but we have come to no dicision upon the matter as Yet, though I think we shall in a few days when I am apprehensive the conclusion will be agreable to my wish.(3) The Vermont affair has not come on but will soon.(4) Ira Allen has been going to and fro in the Earth and walking up & down in it, ever since the Month of November last and I am informed Jos. Fay & a Col. Robertson from the Grants is in the Citty, but I have not seen Fay.(5) A Col. Olcott and Mr. Woodword are now here and there views appeare to me verry agreable.(6) I am of opinion they by no means wish to be seperated from the state of N.H. N.Yrk. with their usual industry will exert every nerve to bring their purposes to pass-but what will be the isue is to me uncertain. The state will soon be called upon to fill up their Regiments so as to compleat about 1200 Men,(7) and also to furnish their proportion of supplies, for the Army, that we may be in a situation to carry on a Vigorous campaign the ensuing Year, or to Negociate to advantage if peace should be proposed. The convention is now siting here, who were to have considered the limitation of prices but have not come to a conclusion as Yet.(8) The spaniards have made considerable progress among the English settlements upon the River Misisippi-taken 900 British Troops &c (9)-no news of the fleet since they left N York nor from Europe a late date-except fresh terminations of the friendly dispositions of the Christian & Catholic Kings-and their willingness to Cooperate with Us in carring on the War. Notwithstan[din]g the high price every thing bears here, Bills meet with a dull sale. I have proposed to contribute our proportion of the public Expence by building ships &c. What think you of this and at what rate can they be built in sterling money? I would write my mind of men and things with more freedom, but I understand many letters from Congress have of late fallen into bad hands &c. with expectation of obtaining the secrets of Congress so that outward bound letters must be cautiously wrote. I was in great hopes to have been relieved by Mr. Livermore but find I am not, and nothing but the cause of my country and the advice of my friends (among whome I have placed not a little dependance upon your opinion) Could have induced me to crucify my interest, & by Tarrying here through the winter, and I must FEBRUARY 7, 1780  beg your influence that I may be releived verry Early in the spring as I shall absolutely if alive within about eight weeks from this time at furtherst.

And it is not in your Power to Compensate for the Disadvantages which will Necessarily attend that very important department upon your refusal. In Short it is my opinion that our having the Naval Department upon a Sure or respectable footing depends exceedingly upon your acceptance. Mr. Livermore is in the Chamber over your Room, And I was in hopes to have been releived by him but find I am not. His appointment as Delegate Expires in a very few days!(2) I imagine much sooner than it will be possible to finish the Vermont affair which has not Come under Consideration yet. Their agents are here. Colo Olcott and Mr. Woodward are also in the City & not in favour of Vermont if I Can Judge Right. By letters from Genl Lincoln we learn that the Spaniards are warmly engaged in reducing the British Settlements upon the River Mississippi, have taken 900 Prisoners-&c &c. The State of New Hampshire will Soon be requested to fill their Regts in the Continental Army to the amount of about 1200 men in all, and also to furnish their Quota of Supplies in kind, as the only probable means of Supporting a proper Army in the field, Next Campaign. No time ought to be lost by the States, for effecting So important an End, The Same exertions are Necessary whether we expect peace or War and I think the Latter most probable notwithstanding the plausable declaration of Some Gentlemen who wish for a peace &c even At the Expence of every thing we ought to hold Dear & Sacred.

(1) The following is the substance of what material has since that time been received from the Southward. Governor Walton, of Georgia, writes the 15h of Decr.(2) that their Assembly were then sitting at Augusta, had appointed Delegates to Congress, were arranging their force, securing their frontiers, & providing to cooperate in the expulsion of the Enemy. General Lincoln, also writes from Charlestown, the l9h & 22d of the same month that the Enemy remained queit-that a Ship with military Stores from Philadelphia had very seasonably arived-that the four continental Frigats ordered there from the Eastward had also arived & brot. in with them a british Privateer of 16 Guns-& were in his opinion, in addition to the french marine their before, sufficient to secure their bar from insults & to keep open the communication of supplies. That the Spaniards had been up the Missisippi & taken possession of the british settlements & made 900 prisoners. And that a considerable Naval force with 4,000 Troops on board, sailed from the Havannah the begining of Decr. for Pensacola or Augustine or both-which however the british Army affected to disbelieve, & had sent no reinforcements to either of those posts-& were in expectation of the arival of Troops from New York. There is every reason to beleive, Sir, that Spain will make a serious diversion in the Florida's; to which perhaps we can have no objection, provided she does not extend her views on the Missisippi beyond the Latitude of 31, nor to an exclusive navigation of that river. The Convention at this place, have concluded to adjourn to the 1st Tuesday of April, & to give notice thereof to Virgina that she may then send commissioners if she thinks proper or otherwise let her determination be known.(3) I have the honor, to be, Sir, with great Esteem & Respect, your Excellency's most obedt. hum Servt.

I am sure it would be best for the Governmt. of every State in the Confederacy to know what we know here. We must cut Throats another Year at least, and we ought to do it vigorously. F & S (1) will persist in strenuous Cooperation for the Purpose of securing our Independce. and indemnifying themselves.(2) An armed mediation is not improbable, in which Case the last mediatorial Offers of Spain may be taken up again so that Britain ought not at the End of the next Campaign to hold Possession of any Part of the Territory of the U.S. Our Enemies do not meet with Countenance in Europe yet, but some Powers there may be obliged by secret Treaties, on certain Events, to interfere  FEBRUARY 8, 1780  against our Interests, tho' unwillingly; disagreable Terms of Peace or additional Force against us & our Allies may therefore become a necessary Alternative. F is extremely desirous that we should put matters upon such a footing in regard to Spain that a lasting Alliance may be formed; and hints at 4 Points 1. A precise & invariable western boundary to the U.S. 2. The exclusive Navign. of Mississipi to S. 3. The Possessn. of the Floridas 4. The Lands on the left or eastern Side of the Miss. On the first F thinks we should go no farther west than was permitted by the royal Proclamn. of 1763. On the 2d. she thinks we have no Right because we have no Territory situated on the River. On the third as it is probable S. will conquer the Flordas during this war every Cause of Dispute between us & her should be removed. On the 4th that the Lands lying on the East Side which were prohibited by the Proclamation abovenamed to be settled by the then Provinces are the Property of the Kg. of Engld. and proper Objects against which Spain may proceed for a permanent Conquest. S conceives that these States have no Right to those Lands not having possessed them nor having a Claim in the Right of the Sovereign whose Govt. we have abjured.(3) On this last we shall assuredly differ- the others are all in a fair Train. We are standing stiff for Mass. that she shd. not be still overburthened by Quota of Troops. We have the Ratio of Sepr. 76 preferred to March 79, but still it is not right; however it will not, I fear, be altered at this very critical & late hour of providing for a vigorous Campaign. 6,070 will be requested from you in a day or two. I do not know that we can possibly get an Army unless Mass. perseveres in furnishing what I know she has judged her Disproportion.(4) Our Frigates are well into Charlestown Harbour with 5 or 6 french ones. The Stores also are arrived there from hence. You will see a Paragraph of Lincolns Letter in Today's paper. I am told our Frigates took other Prizes than the 16 Gun Privateer.

I take the Liberty of troubling you with the enclosed Letters to put them in the Way of reaching the several Persons to whom they are addressed, being assured you will excuse it. A Plan at this Time lies before Congress for establishing regular Packets to France (1) which bids fairer to be attended with Success and Execution than any hitherto attempted or projected. It is to be hoped when this is carried into Effect, the Court of France will adopt a similar Measure. The Connection and Intercourse between the two Nations require such an Establishment, and will also be greatly promoted by it. Should this take Place, the Committee of Foreign Affairs will not find it so difficult to communicate constantly with the Gentlemen who manage the Interests of the Union abroad. It is to be lamented that so great a Slackness has prevailed in this respect hitherto, it being indeed difficult to find Conveyances every Way suitable, but the proper Improvement has not been made in many Cases even of such as offered. I have no Wish to increase Your Excellency's Labour of Correspondence, but beg Leave to mention that I would willingly endeavour to make your Intelligence more frequent, if agreeable to you, being satisfied that the publick Interest may derive Advantage from the regular Communication of Facts though unattended with reflections. By Dispatches dated 22 December last from General Lincoln (2) at Charlestown in South Carolina we are informed that the Enemy are quiet in the Town of Savanna and it's Environs, and have not made any Irruptions into the Country as was apprehended. From this I am led to believe that they suffered more deeply than we supposed FEBRUARY 9, 1780  when the Town was attempted by the allied Forces under the Command of Count D'Estaing and General Lincoln. It is also mentioned that the Spaniards have attacked the English Settlements on the Mississippi, and made nine Hundred Prisoners, and that an Expedition from the Havanna was shortly expected to proceed against Pensacola or St. Augustine. A large Detachment is ordered from the main Army in New Jersey into the Southern Country, so that in all Probability Things will go well there. Vigorous Preparations are making on our Part for the ensuing Campaign. The Enemy since the Evacation of Rhode-Island possess only York-Island and the two adjacent, and have about the End of last Year embarked six or eight Thousand Men for the Southward or the West-Indies, perhaps both. I beg Leave to request, Sir, you will be so good as to procure me tha Nautical Almanack (3) for 1780 and 81 published in London under the Direction of the Comisioners of Longitude and which, I suppose, can be had in Paris. It is not to be bo't here, and I had rather give any Price than be without it. I will answer your Bill to any Person in this City, and acknowledge the Kindness by any Services in my Power.

We do not chuse to dwell upon the embarrassing & distressed situation to which the delay of Genl. Scot & Mr. Duane have reduced us. We could have wished to have had the benefit of their assistance in a matter of so much moment to the State, or at least, if deprived of that by any unforeseen accident, to have been possessed of such materials as would have enabled us to exert our poor abilities in her behalf. We do ourselves the honour to enclose your Excellency the only paper which we have recd. upon the subject. You will judge how far this could be serviceable to us. As it may be of some consequence to know the disposition of our antagonists We will endeavour to give you all we can collect here. Masachusets seems to be indifferent about their claim. New Hampshire extreamly anxious to have a determination, but more so to come to some amicable settlement by which they may preserve to themselves such towns as wish to be with them, on the east side of the mountains, & to relinquish all on the West side absolutely together with those on the east side which wish to be connected with New York. The people who have the power on the grants are firmly determined as far as we can collect, to opposition by arms. From this State of facts we are unanimously of opinion, that agents shd. be appointed to conclude some agreement with New Hampshire, and to form a treaty with them for the restoration of peace and good order in that part of the government. The Issue of an appeal to arms considering the dispo[si]tion of our own people, of those on the grants, & in the eastern States, will we conceive be very doubtful, the Country turbulent & unquiet, & the expence of the force necessary to subdue it beyond our abilities. Nor can it be of importance to have subjects whose natural connection is with another State, the Mountains opposing an insuperable bar to their commercial intercourse with New York. These sentiments we have taken the liberty to submit to your Excellencys consideration, if you shall think them worthy your attention you will communicate them to the Legislature. We also enclose the result of a months conference of delegates from different states in convention.(3) We thought it proper in order to avoid all censure, that one of us shd. attend, & assure them of the disposition of our State to do all that was required of them upon this subject. We must most earnestly recommend it to our Legislature to take immediate measure for informing themselves accurately of the quantity of flour, grain, & hay, taken for the use of the army, under the Laws of our State, since the first of August last, as it may be of the utmost moment to them. A report now laying before congress for quotas in kind for the use of Army, & remitting two thirds of the tax  to be raised to the State which shall furnish it. (4) If this shd. pass & we should be able to make it retrospect we are confident that it will appear that we have already furnished all that will be demanded, we are anxious to be furnished with this account, & the prices at which taken as soon as possible. The papers which we enclose contain all the little news of this Place. We are Sir, With the greatest respect & esteem, Your Excellency's Most Obt. Hum. Servt. Wm.

8404,dg014474,1780,North Carolina Delegates to Richard Caswell,"""North Carolina Delegates to Richard Caswell   Sir Philadelphia Feby 9th. 1780 You will before this arrives have received Some resolutions of Congress for recruiting [an] army,(1) a business of the highest Importance at all times, but now peculiarly Interesting, by Reason of the Critical Situation of public affairs, which requires the next campaign to be prosecuted with Such Vigor as may entirely expel the Enemy from every part of the united States. We are persuaded that the advantages arising from Such decisive Success are obvious to every one in the general assembly and scarcely think we have occasion to add any other Suggestions to excite their most vigorous and expeditious exertions for preparing a formidable force to take the field as early as possible, but we cannot Suppress our Opinion which we  FEBRUARY 10, 1780  have formed on good grounds, the restoration of Peace, and the future tranq[uility] of the United States, and particularly those to the Southward, in a great measure depend on the Compleat expulsion of the Enemy by the Operations of the current year. The Proportions of the Several States are far from being estimated by any precise or Satisfactory rule; and you will perceive a resolution for an equitable adjustment of the expence attending the raising and providing for Such Troops as shall be found to be beyond the due proportions. The Ideas we have of the Circumstances of the State we have the honor to represent determined us to endeavour to obtain a resolution for making all the Efforts of the States for raising men, whether as regulars or Militia, a Common expence.(2) We remembered the vast Sums disbursed by the State and vast expences incurred in calling out militia and making extraordinary exertions in a War whose object is common, and whose Operations have been, perhaps, less threatening to her than to her Neighbors. We also foresaw, that She must make Still greater Exertions in Consequence of the Enemy having pointed their hostilities principally against the Southern States, and we deem it our duty, especially as doubts were thrown out in debate, to take the Sense of Congress, directly, on the Question in order that the General assembly may be fully informed, on a Subject So Interesting to their Constituents. We have failed in our motion as you will See by the inclosed Extract from the Journals. The States who voted against it are very Apprehensive of very great, and perhaps unnecessary expence being the Consequence, if Such a resolution were it to have restrospect, but Seem to have no matterial objection to its future Operation. As our State is much Interested in the retrospective operation, we did not chuse to move it in that form without more particular Instructions from the State.(3) Your Excellency's Ob. Servts., John Penn Thos. Burke. Allen Jones. ""

You may expect to receive as soon as possible from the Commander in Chief or his order,(2) an accurate return of the Troops now in service belonging to the state which will ascertain the deficiency to be furnished by the States respectively agreeable to the Act inclosed. As the Quotas apportioned to each State may be supposed not to be exactly Just you will observe Congress have made provision to pay the Expence any State hath incurred or may incur by furnishing more than their Just proportion of men. It is recommended to each State respectively in the strongest Terms punctually to comply with this requisition by furnishing their respective Quotas of Men compleat without loss of Time. Many powerful motives too obvious to need enumeration conspire to urge the propriety, policy, & necessity of having a respectable Army ready to take the field early in the spring. Vigorous exertions and a respectable Army in the field are the most sure means to prevent the necessity of another Campaign on the one hand, or on the other to crown it with the desired success and put a period to the Contest upon honourable Terms.

8407,dg014477,1780,Robert R Livingston to John Jay,"""Robert R. Livingston to John Jay   Dear John Philadelphia 10th Feby 1780 I have just steped out of Congress to let you hear by this opportunity that your friends in this part of the world are well & not unmindful of you & to acknowledge the rect of yours from Reedy Island (1) FEBRUARY 10, 1780  which after long & wearysome peregrenations reached me three days ago at this place. The Cypher it contains is not sufficiently intricate to be in any wise relyed on, if the conveyance by which this is to go shd. be delayed I will inclose one that you may venture to express your most hidden thoughts in. If not we will continue the use of yours till a better is established. The Winter has been so uncomly severe here-as to exclude all foreign intelligence, & for some time all commerce between the several States. Chesapeek, Delaware, & New York bays, together with the Sound, are all frozen so as to bear loaded carts & it is asserted that the Ice extends some miles into the sea. One hardly knows how to communicate information to a person so far removed from us, if we mention nothing but what is new in this part of the world we omit many things which may possibly not have reached the others, And by writing transactions which have passed long since, we run the hazard of obliging you to read what some more punctual correspondent has communicated before. However as the last is the least evil, I will venture to inform you that Sir Henry Clinton sailed from New York with the light infantry & Granadiers of the whole army, & most of the cavalry, & so many other troops as made the whole number about 7000 men. He left the Hook the 26th Decr two days after which came on a most violent North East Storm accompanied with rain & snow. This was followed by North Westerly Winds, & the most extreme cold wheather that has been known in this climate. As several vessels foundered at their anchors within the Hook, we cannot but promise ourselves that this fleet have suffered severely by it, many of them being very probably lost & the remainder driven in a shattered condition to the West Indies. What gives weight to this conjecture is, that neither the Enemy nor we have had the least intelligence of them since their departure, tho we have great reason to believe that they were designed for North & South Carolina, And had they arrived within the usual time I think we must have had intelligence from thence. You have doubtless recd. information of the operations of the Spanish troops in the Missisipi where they have dispossessed the British of several posts & are as we are informed preparing a strong force at the Havanah to make an attempt upon St. Augustine, or Pensicola, which has very probably succeeded by this time, we having no accounts from Charlestown latter than the 22d Decr. at which times the enimies army under Provost still remained at Savannah. I am thus particular because I conceive every information from that quarter of the world may be particularly useful to you in your present situation, & I am fearful that you do not get all you shd from the committee for foreign Affairs of which I have at present the honor to be a member, and which I am labouring to get disolved in order to apoint a secretary for that department. Tho' I know that our little differences of   sen[timent] can be of no great momment to you, yet I can not help telling you that Coll. Lawrance having refused to accept his appointment, we have been for some time endeavouring to supply his place. The Candidates Lovel, Morris, Hamilton & Coll Steward. The first had six votes on three different ballotings, the second five.(2) As both parties were fixed the matter rests till some other expedient can be fallen upon. The Minister of france has done me the honor to express the warmest wish that I should go to his court, and as I am absolute in my determination not to fill the present vacantcy, he proposes to his friends to appoint a resident as my desire to go abroad is extreamly languid.(3) I have done nothing to promote this design, & I am inclined to think that its novelty will be a good osstensible reason with many for not going into the measure tho' some embrace it very warmly-there is a method in which I could affect it, but then I shd. place {Lov[e]l [in a] situation which will give him too [m]uch influence over foreign negotiations},(4) a thing by all means to be avoided. We have determined to make the greatest exertions this campaign & have called upon the respective States for their quotas of thirty five thousand men which is to be the number of our troops for the ensuing season & who may in a few days in the Northern States be encreased to twice that number if required to act upon any sudden emergency. While we anxiously wish for peace we see no other road to it but such as our arms invent for us. This much for news and politicks. There is one other subject on which I might enter but it requires both more paper and more leisure than I have left. Let me then bid you adieu after requesting you to divide my best wishes with the partner of your heart & my other friends which you carried from hence & believe me to be, Yours Most sincerely, Rob.

We were all very happy the day before yesterday at recg a letter from Mr. Jay, but on opening we found it dated at Martinique where he was driven after loosing all his Masts & Bowsprit, off the Banks of Newfoundland. He got in to Martinique the l9th Decr and left it in a french frigate the 26. all well on board. On the day of their arrival the english fleet from St Lucy engaged a fleet of merchantmen under convoy of a frigate, & notwithstanding a gallant attempt of Monsr La Motte Pequet with 3 ships to relieve them took 14 of them. The English have a decided superiority at sea in the west Indias, owing to the storm that divided the french fleet. The Minister tells me that he has acc[ount]s from Europe so late as Novr, the combined fleet was then preparing for sea under Mr Chaffant, Count D'Olivers being removed from the command,(1) great preparations were making on both sides to carry on the war with spirit-the ensuing summer, & very little prospect of a peace. I have yet recd no papers from Mr Scott, nor do I hear when he or Mr Duane are to come on.(2) By this means I am prevented from availing myself of the Snow to bring Mrs Livingston home, which I had intended.

I shd be glad to know whether they are like to pass such a support bill as will enable me to keep my office. My expences this winter and the oppressive taxes which I am charged render it necessary for me to look about me, surely they shd think my whole time a sufficient tax, & give me as much for my services as will discharge them, I ask no more, or what is still less that they would suffer me to depart in peace.

8422,dg014492,1780,Rhode Island Delegates to William Greene,"""Rhode Island Delegates to William Greene   Sir, Philadelphia Feby. 15th. 1780. Congress have come to sundry resolutions, determining the number of privates of which the army is to consist, and adjusting the quotas of the States; which we suppose are sent to the State; (1) but as it is possible that they may not reach your Excellency so early as this letter, we will just mention that the whole number of privates is to be thirty five thousand, and our quota eight hundred and ten. We objected to the quota assigned to our state, and proposed that it should not exceed seven hundred men; but were not able to procure any reduction. Several other States made similar objections; but it was thought too late to alter the adjustments and set the matter afloat, and so the report stands as it was offer'd by the board of war, only with the qualifying resolution added to it which you will take notice of. We received a letter last Saturday from Mr. Jay, our minister to the Court of Madrid, informing us that the Confederacy, off the banks of Newfoundland, met with a violent Storm which carried away her masts and Bowspreet, and obliged her to put away for Martinico where she arrived the l9th of December. His letter was dated the 20th. He further advises us that a British Squadron from St Lucia fell in with about 25 french merchant Vessels, under convoy of a frigate, off and bound to Martinico. That the enemy took 14 of them and drove too ashore. Monsieur De le' Mothe Pequet was dispatch'd to persue them as soon as possible, but, his force being inferior to the enemy, it was not in his power to recover the capture. Mr. Bingham, our agent at Martinico, in a letter of a later date mentions that Mr. Jay sailed in the Aurora frigate for France the 26th of December. We are told that there are letters in Town from St. Eustatius so late as the middle of January; but not a word of news from Europe. The Georgians have organized Government, and are determined to hold their State as long as they can. The Seat of Government is at Augusta. The Spaniards have taken possession of the British Settlements on the Mississippi; and a respectable fleet with 4000 troops sailed from Havannah for Pensacola or Augustine, or both the beginning of December. Affairs wear a better aspect to the Southward than they did some time ago. We have not received any intelligence respecting the famous fleet from New York since it sailed. We have nothing further to add at present but that we are with great respect, Your Excellency's most obedt. humble Servts. William Ellery John Collins P.S. Genl. Lincoln in a letter bearing date Jany. 8th (2) informs that by the last accounts from Savannah he was informed \""that the 60th  FEBRUARY 16, 1780  Regiment was order'd to St Augustine. The enemy seem to be alarmed at the movements of the Spaniards. We do not know yet the fate of Mobille or of Pensacola. There is some reason to believe that they are both in the hands of the Spaniards; this is undoubtedly the report in Savannah. I have it from deserters and Mr. Cowen one of our Offs. who lately left it. What foundation there is for the report or what gave rise to it I know not. I have my doubts with respect to the fact, though I think it my duty & that I may safely give the hint on mentioning my authority.\"" \""I am just informed that 6 or 700 of the No. Carolina militia are arrived at Camden.\"" Camden is 126 miles from Charlestown.

8423,dg014493,1780,John Armstrong Sr to Horatio Gates,"""John Armstrong, Sr., to Horatio Gates   Carlisle 16th Feby. 1780. Expresses his \""uneasy feellings and anxious apprehensions, on the distracted & melancholly State of our finances.... \""The first, and fundamental remidy is the Regulation of Prices through all our States by the publick Authority of Law. 2d, a Speedy determined and judicious Reformation of mistakes or abuses, in the two great departments of the Staff, including in it a Retrenchment of Expences, Offices and Officers-and this by the by, cannot in my Opinion be effected otherwise than by the Several States, or their Commissioners, perhaps best appointed in their respective Counties. 3d, The laying in of certain quantities of Grain, at the expence of the Owners in Such Magazines as may be appointed, for which Carriage a moderate Miliage may be allowed, except in the distance of five miles, The Grain to be delivered at the regulated price, or pass in whole, or in part of the Owners Tax. These measures at Once Simple, regular & virtuous, aided by such taxation as the people can bear, which by the way must be greatly lessened to what it now is-and by Domestick Loans, will by the Divine blessing carry us on until a foreign Loan can have time to Operate. But if these Steps be declined, I dread to mention the approaching consequences. As for the Chimerically refined notions of Finance which some men have thrown out, they must be considered as so many Phantoms. The plain highway of Regulation by Law, appears now by fatal experience & dint of necessity the only rational line of our direction-and however FEBRUARY 16, 1780  doubtfull may have been that such a Law cou'd not be put in execution, the more disinterested people here are lamenting the delay of this measure, and grieved to hear that very lately Virginia had Sent no Commissio[ne]rs to assist in binding up the bleeding wounds of this Country-Shall they bleed to death, altho' made with our hands! is not this a kind of National Suicide? Shall poor Jersey be constrained to repeal her virtuous Law? have we now any known value annexed to our currency even for the Space of One Week. Is not all rational calculation at an end, and the use of figures become futile-are we not well pictured by a Ship on the Ocean without Helm or Rudder left to the mercy of the waves! But thanks to god only who commands the waves of our political Sea & may yet vouchsafe to take the helm into his Omnipotent hand. He reigns, let every honest heart & genuine Whigg be Glad! A wise & vigorous regulation must prove to our affairs at present as the main spring of a Watch to the wheels-no matter how many lesser amendments are made in our finances or how proper in themselves, if not fixed on this basis, the disease will recur-palliate they may & but a little- Cure they can not, having no radical powers. As to the Merchantile rule or Hackneyed Maxim that Trade only can regulate itself, I can Scarcely Speak of it with patience, but shall only Say that Obstructed as our commerce is abroad by the Enemy, and by Speculators & Monopolizers, perverted at home, that general rule is with us highly exceptionable, and none but the interested or unobservant part of Our Countrymen can with any propriety plead it in opposition to a regulation by Law, which however arduous, is compelled by the present state of affairs and justified by necessity, as is every act, whether National or personal, that has virtue for it's motive & end.\"" ""

8424,dg014494,1780,James Lovell to Samuel Adams,"""James Lovell to Samuel Adams   Dear Sir Feby. 16 1780 I wrote yesterday (1) by Post of the Disaster which the Confederacy met with near the Banks of Newfoundland when she lost her Bowsprit, masts, Yards and part of her Sails, her Rudder also being split. She however carried her Passengers into Martinique on the 19 of Decr. from whence they sailed again for France in the Frigate Aurora, on the 25th of that same month. I inclosed you yesterday two Letters from Genl. Lincoln which he wished safe, I had no right to franc the two now inclosed; and besides, I thought that the dividing the four sent to my Care would give a Chance of conveying News from the Southward to the Generals family by the first Oppertunity, which is a Thing in doubt between the Post & Express, tho the Post has now the Start. The Enemy, at the  FEBRUARY 16, 1780  Time of the General's Writing (Jan 8th) had got to be allarmed about St. Augustine and were sending some of their Troops from Savanna to that Place. No Sight of the Enemy's Fleet was had at Charlestown 16 Days after sailing from New York. Perhaps the News Paper of this Day may retail the Reports from Virginia of another Kind, a quite contrary one. Congress has taken so much notice of Govr Geo Walton's Complaints about Brig McIntosh as to inform him his Service in the southern Department is dispensed with, conveying to him a Copy of the Governor's Letter and a Paragraph of one from the Speaker of the Georgia Assembly.(2) The Spirit of that State, as it appears in those Letters is excellent. Waltons Letter was directed to you or any of the old members from Massachusetts, and Gerry & I have not slighted the fair occasion of cultivating that Confidence which seemed to be placed now in a Spirit which some of Brownson's Colleagues did not formerly coalesce with as he did. Govr. Walton says he shall certainly be here in the Spring. I suppose as a Delegate special if not general. I hope there has been no printed mention of my going abroad. Your News Papers are remarkable lately for more groundless Paragraphs than most others. I have been told of my name, having thus got in. But I am far from Embarking and I own I am pleased, since I find how much Cabal enters into the Business. We are to discuss next Satday the Proposition for appointing a Resident with his official Powers to go to France instead of a Secy to the Embassy. This will dignify the Place enough for R R Livingston:(3) and I am somewhat inclined to think that our Affairs here make several wish to be away from the fatigue which they cause. I do not like the Scale of Influence abroad should have Weights from New York rather than from some other State. But I shall not encline to stand against R R L in the Nomination for the new Office tho I will always allow myself to stand as a Check upon Gr M s.(4) Upon the whole I must begin to think altogether of getting along thro' the War as well as possible upon the old Ground of drudge hard & fare hard too; which is the Lot of most of the faithful in our Cause. I dare not believe the Paragraph from Virginia, in the Paper inclosed.(5) I believe I must forward my Accounts to Boston that I may get the Balances of the 3 years back, what was due in 77 would have so cloathed me that I should not need now to spend twice more for one Suit than I sent my Family through all that Year. 70 Dollrs.

You must not expect very regular Answers to them from the Interruptions to Journying caused by the severest Winter we have known since 1740, I mean severe as to Snow chiefly. We begin to made Shuttle Cocks of as usual when the Enemy are in yr. Quarter. I suspend all Belief but on your Letters, therefore let us have them as often as your greater Business will permit. You will hear from the Comtee. who receive your Letters,(2) what our State of Finance & Supply of Food & Rayment is or rather is not, Yet we are to look for a vigorous Campaign. I hope the States are rousing from a Sort of Lethargy, and that they will be able to carry on the next Campaign well notwithstanding the ill Appearances of the present moment. As to Penobscot we hear almost nothing. But it will be taken into the Plans of Opperation for our Army when recruited. So extensive a Continent calls for great Numbers of Defendants & we can find but few though it is a Land of Plenty, unless Avarice will relax a little of its harpy Demands upon our Treasury. Our State have determined to make good the Pay of their Troops for 3 years back, and have determined a Scale of Depreciation by a mean Ratio on the 4 Commodities of Beef, Indian Corn, Sheeps Wool & Soal Leather taken monthly from Jany. 77 to Jan 80, the last amountg. to 32, 50 [hundreths?] (3) for 1. This is turning the Tables upon the Farmers with a Vengeance I think. But yet Farmers must have done it in Court. I am, likely, to drudge on here another Year, and will be ready for rendering you any Services in my Power but trying to draw you from the Southward till Things look more favorably in that Quarter.

8426,dg014496,1780,Abraham Clark to the New Jersey Assembly,"""Abraham Clark to the New Jersey Assembly   Sir Philada. Febry. 17. 1780 The Convention for regulating prices have Adjourned till April and I fear the Attempt will prove Abortive, Virginia seems to hang back, no members have attended from thence, and as far as I can learn none have been Appointed, and their Legislature stands Adjourned till May. I shudder at the prospects before us, a Virgorous War to prosecute, while our money reduced almost to nothing, is Still depreciating with rapidity. The Current exchange here between hard money & paper is from 45 to 50 for one. In the Market, a paper Dollar is estimated at present at one penny and will soon be less than a half penny in all probability. Congress have now under Consideration the Apportionment of Supplies for the Army to be required of each state the present year,(1) One [Our] Quota at present stands at 18000 hundred weight of Beef or pork, 10,000 barrels of Flour, 3,758 bushels of Salt,3,500 Tons of hay, 30,000 bushels of Corn, Oats or buckwheat.(2) The Estimate of Prices, as follows. Flour 4 1/2 Dollars per hundred, Summer fatted Beef 5 1/2 dollr per neat hundred, fall fatted Do. 6 1/2 dollars, Stall fed killed after Janry. 7 1/2 Dollars, fresh pork 7 dollars per neat hundred; Salted pork 22 dollars per barrl. containing 240 lb. Indian Corn, 3/4 dollar per bushl., Oats 1/2, Rie 1, Buckwheat 2/3 dollar per bushl., best first crop hay 15 dollrs. per Ton, Rum 1 1/2 dollrs. per Gall, Salt 3 dollars per bushl. For my part I dislike the plan altogether, as purchases ought to be made where most Convenient having regard to the places where they are to be consumed & the prices in the several states which must depend upon the seasons in them, but I am assured the plan is Agreable to the wishes of our Legislature, by whose Opinion I shall Always be governed. The Salt I fear will be procured with difficulty in our state, but as the prices above Are all Estimated in Specie & that Article Set at 3 dollars, I dare not refuse it to our State, Specially as other states wish for that Article and offer to take it from us in exchange for flour or Other provisions at the Estimated prices-but as Salt is much higher estimated than any other Article, I think we may exchange provisions for it to much greater Advantage by private Contractor perhaps, by promoting the Manufactory of Iron on publick Acct. we may procure that Article of Salt in exchange for Iron and save our provisions. In Case our Legislature shall desire to FEBRUARY 17, 1780  be freed from procuring the Salt by taking upon them the Supply of Other Articles Equivalent in Value as Estimated, by Signifying their pleasure thereon, I am persuaded the matter can be affected. Thus far I had wrote before Congress took up the business of Supplies this Day. They had before gone through the Quotas and now took into Consideration the Prices as reported by the Comme. and have Agreed to the price for flour as Above mentioned. The next under Consideration was the Price of Beef, this is not finished but will I believe pass agreable to the report-more of us would be willing to Alter some Articles did we not see that it would deraing all we had before done without any Material Advantage, so that the Prices I have mention[ed], tho' only as reported from a Come. from Each state will I believe be Agreed to. Should any material Alteration take place so as to affect our state, we shall Attempt a reconsideration of the Quotas. I am with all due respects to the General Assembly, your Obedt. & Humble Servt.

Shall be 5 1/2 Dollers, per hundred\"" was under the Consideration of Congress yesterday when I moved \""that the paragraph of the Report of the Committee respecting the prices of Articles which were restricted agreable to the late Act of the State of N Jersey, be recommitted, & that the price of Flower is fixed by Congress agreable to the price agreed on by the Convention of the States from New Hampshire to Pennsylvania inclusively, held at N Haven in January 1778 the Committee be directed to adjust the prices of other Articles in the proportions adopted by the Convention\""-& that upon a question, whether the Motion was in order, I appealed to the House & required the Yeas & Nays, whereupon the president taking the Sense of the House declared that the calling the Yeas & Nays in this Case was by the House determined to be out of Order. If the Decision of the House affected me only in a private Capacity, I should not hesitate a Moment to pass it over in Silence, altho my Feelings would be injured by being denyed a privilege which other Members under similar Circumstances had enjoyed; but as it affects me in a publick Character, I am reduced to the disagreeable Alternative of giving up what appears to me an important privilege of a Member of the House, or of defending the same against the Determinations of a Body whose Honor I have much at Heart & shall always endeavour to support. The former, I am not authorized to do & therefore I shall defend the privilege to the best of my abilities & leave the State which I have the Honor to represent to do the Rest. Congress have wisely endeavoured so to frame their Rules, as to give every Member an Opportunity of shewing his Conduct to his Constituents, & I hold this as a privilege essential to the Interest of the publick, & to the Honor of every Member of Congress; for without it should a Majority of the Members at any Time be arbitrary both in principles & practice, which I sincerely hope will never be the Case, they would oblige the others to leave the House, or suffer unmerited Censure. In the present Case many precedents have been & more may be produced to shew that the Yeas & Nays have been frequently called on questions of Order, some of which have been determined in the Affirmative & others in the Negative; & if the House undertakes to  determine on what Motions the question of Order shall be decided by Yeas & Nays, I conceive that their Rules will only serve as Cobwebs to catch Flies, or in other words as pretexts to enable a Majority, if arbitrary, to bring on the Journals such part of the Conduct of each Member as they may think proper, & thus put a favorable Appearance on their own unjustifiable proceedings, whilst they stigmatize those of the Minority, however wise or vertuous. I think it peculiarly hard in the present Case, when the paragraph of a Report was under the Consideration of Congress, which as it respected some of the States appeared to me to operate great Injustice, & I made a Motion to prevent it, that the Question of Order should be agitated; that the Decision of the House thereon should preclude me from their Sense on the Motion, & that whatever Reason I may have to suppose that Decision improper, I should be prevented from shewing the Impropriety or even the Existance thereof. The House will probably remember that in a similar Case, when the Report for recruiting the Army was under Consideration, I waved my privilege of appealing to the House on the question of Order, to prevent Altercations on the question of privilege, & afterwards produced to them many of the precedents quoted herein, in Hopes, that by convincing the House of the Facts, all Disputes relative thereto would have been afterwards prevented. I am unhappy that any part of the present Time of Congress should be spent on a question of Order; I did not agitate it & only required a Decision in the usual Mode. I shall only add sir, that I think it my indispensible Duty to repeat my Requisition, as a Matter of privilege, that the Sense of the House may be taken by the Yeas & Nays, \""whether the Motion which I made Yesterday for recommitting the paragraph of the Report respecting Prices then under the Consideration of the House, was in Order,\"" and I shall be under the Necessity of regulating my Conduct accordingly by the proceedings of the House on this Requisition.

8435,dg014505,1780,Elbridge Gerry to Samuel Huntington,"""Elbridge Gerry to Samuel Huntington   Sir, Philadelphia 22d Feby 1780 I am informed by some of my Collegues, that Congress have not yet considered the Letter which I had the Honor of addressing them the l9th Inst. containing a Remonstrance against their Decision of the preceeding Day, which I conceived had deprived me of an essential privilege of a Member of the House.(1) The Reason assigned for this is, that some Gentlemen objected to my Mode of proceeding as unparliamentary, & said, that a Member who supposes his privileges Invaded, should remonstrate in his place & may there be heard. I know of no Resolution of Congress for governing their proceedings by Rules of parliament, neither will they apply in general, or in the present Case. Nevertheless, I shall readily attend Congress, if they think it expedient, but cannot consent to take my place for these amongst other Reasons; that I have not the privilege in Congress of other Members, & that every Member, by the Rules of the House may require my Voice upon any question agitated & put whilst I am in Congress, in answering which I shall betray my Cause. When Disputes respecting privilege are not between Congress & a Member, the latter may complain in his place without these Inconveniences. I conceive that the privilege contended for, is an essential one, &, that without it, a Member cannot discharge his Trust. Congress have viewed it in this Light, or I presume they would not have ingrafted it into the Confederation;(2) & twelve of the States are of the same opinion, or they would probably never have ratified it, without objecting to the Article establishing this privilege. Several Days have elapsed since my Absence from Congress, during which Time they have proceeded in the important Business under Consideration at the Time of my leaving it. If I ought to be restored to the privilege claimed, Congress will perceive, that in the present Case a Delay of Justice is a Denial of it to the State which I have the Honor to represent so far at least, as I am able to render it Any Services in Congress. Congress will consider or not consider, my Letter, & grant or refuse my Claim, as to them may seem meet;(3) I am no Way solicitous about the Event, as it respects me personally; but as a Member of the House & Citizen of the united States wish to prevent a Measure which if confirmed by Congress will, as it appears to me, strike at a fundamental principle of the union.

We have for some time past daily expected Mr. Duane or Mr. Scott with the Act of Assembly, and the papers respecting the New FEBRUARY 22, 1780  Hampshire Grants. I do not know that the delay on our part hitherto has been attended with any greater disadvantages, than would reasonably be expected. It has encouraged the Vermonts, and is considered by their friends here as a circumstance in their favor. The Attorney General from New Hampshire(1) is now confined with the small pox by inoculation, and will not likely attend in 8 or 10 days; so that nothing will be done in the business till March, in all probability. The agents from Vermont are gone home without receiving any answer from Congress;(2) those from the East side of the mountain (3) Still continue here waiting for the trial: some gentlemen are going home this week, who are the greatest friends to the proceedings of the people on the Grants, and probably will not return till after the hearing of the cause, which will be no disadvantage to us . Congress have for some time past been busily employed in forming estimates of Supplies to be furnished by the different States for the ensuing campaign, and fixing prices to the particular articles; which has been attended with much difficulty, as always I believe is the case, when quotas are to be fixed; I expect it will pass in a few days, as the greatest part of the report has been agreed to though 'tis likely some alterations may be made. I enclose you a copy of the supplies required, and the prices as they now stand in which is included the necessary supplies for the Navy twelve months, and the supplies requested by our Allies.(4) I hope this measure if pursued will be attended with the good effects expected from it, at the same time I fear more difficulties will be experienced in carrying it into execution than is at present imagined. If the money should continue to depreciate, as it has lately done here, it will be difficult for the States to furnish their quota of supplies, and pay one third of their tax into the Treasury, as is expected. The exchange of money here is now at 50 for one; it is difficult to assign the reasons for this late depreciation. The emissaries of the enemy by exchanging and raising the price of hard money in a few instances soon fix the rates of exchange in this city, by which every thing else is regulated. A master of a vessel has arrived here from Havannah, which he left the 31st of December, and on his voyage the eighth of Jan'ry saw a large fleet to the Southward of Georgia, which 'tis supposed to be the fleet that sailed from New York or part of them. The River is not yet open here; near twenty vessels 'tis said are arrived below, amongst which some are from France, by which 'tis expected we may receive material intelligence; which if we should, I shall not fail to communicate to you. I have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedt. servt. Ezra L'Hommedieu ""

8440,dg014510,1780,James Lovell to George Washington,"""James Lovell to George Washington   General Washington, Philada. Feb. 23d. 1780 From Expressions in some of your Excellency's Letters to Congress and in one lately to Baron Steuben I conceive that you imagine us more regularly informed than we have actually been about European Affairs-particularly about our Interests in France.(1) The Correspondence with our Ministers at foreign Courts passing especially under my Eye & Finger, I wish you to be persuaded that I will not omit giving you any Information in my Power from time to time which I can judge may conduce either to your Ease in the Formation of military Plans, or to your Relief under Anxieties about Supplies expected from Europe. With the latter View, I was putting some Facts together to warrant a Conclusion that our Letters to the King of France, and Invoices to our Minister there had arrived on the l9th of September.(2) Luckily however I am not left to Inferences, a Packet having come to my Hand from Doctor Franklin dated September 30th in which he mentions the Receipt & consequent Presentation of those Letters & Invoices: He signifies only his Hopes of obtaining all or a great Part of the Articles.(3) But the Minister of France here had some Weeks ago known under a Date of October from Versailles that Supplies were certainly ordered, tho' it was not clear till now that such Order was posterior to a precise Knowledge of our Wants being conveyed to the King. This is the only Letter received from Doctor Franklin since one of May 26 last year which came to hand Augst. 17th following. Doctor Lee under Date of Decr. 8th from Paris (4) has covered the King of England's Speech to his Parliament on November 25th and Sir Joseph York's Memorial to the States General of Holland on the FEBRUARY 23, 1780  26th both which you will see in the Gazettes of Philada. They are uncommonly modest. I do not however conclude that England is without any Friends in Europe merely because no mention is made of them in the Speech from the Throne. For, those should not be boasted of as Friends on one Side who mean to step out soon as Mediators between contending Parties. Nor is it good Policy to forearm a Foe by publishing well founded Expectations of new Aids. The Stories of the Display of our 13 Stripes in Holland may be perhaps pleasing to certain Classes here, but I have some Proofs that Things have been conducted rather in Conformity to Dutch Politics, and in a Manner that will be productive of more solid Benefit than the Pleasure of indulging the little proud Affections of our rising Navy.(5) I am, with much Esteem, Your Excellency's Most humble Servant, James Lovell ""

I made the Printer complete a few of the Treaties as he had got the last Proof corrected before the Decission to leave the Sheets out of the Journal. Any Person who understands french may with a Pen make the Accents; and some Gentlemen in every state will wish to have the Treaties in the Language in which they were originally composed. And though the commercial one was printed authoritatively in France yet the political one never was I believe unless as translated from the English in our News papers. Send the Paper to Mrs. A____ . You will see that we have at last got some Intelligence from Europe.(2) I mentioned to you that the Retalliation & the Poole had arrived in France Sept 19. They are now in this River. By Doctr. Franklin's Letter of Sept 30 to me, We know he had presented ours of July with the Invoices to the King, And tho' no definitive answer had been then given to the Doctr. yet the Chevr. Luzerne some Weeks ago had notice from Versailles of Octr. date that the Supplies were ordered; But the Chevr did not know till he saw my Letter that the order was posterior to the King's precise Knowledge of our Wants. We are bogueing in Congress much divided upon a Report consequential of our promise made Decr 14.(3) It is impossible to be accurate but crying Iniquity may be avoided. The two great Rocks are. Shall we now state the prices at which the similar articles shall be credited to all the States? Shall we do it in spanish Dollars. Would or would not the last totally destroy our Paper, that very Paper with wch. the States must purchase. FEBRUARY 24, 1780  Whatever we do we ought soon to do, or we shall frustrate the Views of our Allies who have pointed out to us plainly that we should be decisively vigorous this Campaign. Whether we do or do not fix the Prices now it would be wise in the Rulers of our State to cast about how they shall procure certainly and most oeconomically 56,000 Cwt of Beef 12,126 Bushels of Salt 195,628 Galls. West Indian Rum so as to furnish the whole in the Course of the year, the first partly on hoof & partly in Barrels. Pork may be given in Lieu of Beef. Continental Rum for W. India with the stipulated allowances if any are stipulated or if not at equitable odds. As to the Greatness of the Tax it should be considered we went on Years without any. What signifies calling for that which is nought? If the millions called for will not produce the Quota of Supplies double or treble millions must be had. And the States will get them with ten times the ceconomy that our commissarial Legions would. Let every Man that has a Tongue preach to bring about a vigorous Campaign . Excuse my slovenly Manner. I am really in want of two pair of Hands. I am alone again on the meek Comtee. of for. Affairs, Mr. Livingston & Mr. Houston being like their predicessors gone for a Season .(4) A Lee writes to the Comtee. of a Paris date Decr. 8 [a] few Words to cover The King of Englands Speech & Yorks memorial,(5) tollerably modest Things. But we ought not, as Arthur does, to conclude that England has no Friends in Europe because the Speech is silent on that Head. It would be wrong to hold up as Friends Those who may soon appear as Mediators. Or if any mean to take an armed active Part the Antagonist should not be forewarned. I own that I conclude from the Speech that England knows of a Certainty that she shall be befriended; And I believe she has been advised to say nothing of America by some intentional mediators. The tickling Story of the Stripes hoisted in Holland may have its Run But I have some Proofs that matters have been conducted more agreably to dutch Politics; and [In] a Way that will produce more sol[i]d Good than the Pleasure of indulging the proud Affectations of an rising Navy.

You will observe that the prices affixed to the several Articles are in Spanish milled Dollars and the accounts are to be kept and finally Settled in like Currency as a fixed Standard in order that equal Justice may be done to all the States and to prevent the great Inequality of Prices which hath happened in some Instances in different States and places for Articles of the same kind and Quality. As it is not in the power of Congress at present to determine the just Quota of each State they have made provision in this as in former acts that Justice shall be done to each State in the final Settlement of their Accounts. It is supposed that each State will chearfully take upon themselves to furnish, Collect and deposite the provisions and Articles assigned to them respectively, which being done will supersede the necessity of purchasing Commissaries and Quarter masters in the several States. In order to enable the States the more easily to comply with this Act you will observe they are excused from paying in the Continental Treasury two thirds of the Monies which they were called on to raise monthly for the use of the united States by the Resolution of the 6th of October last.(2) Congress have thought it expedient to form the Estimate of Supplies as large as would be necessary for the most vigorous Exertions in any Case that may be with probability supposed; but as the Scene of Action may change or from a Variety of other Causes and unforeseen Events the Quantity of Supplies necessary to be furnished by all or any of the States cannot be reduced to a Certainty, it is expected the Commissary General will give due notice to the several States of the kind and quantity of Articles wanted from time to time that they may [be] collected or deposited at the places assigned by the Commander in Chief.(3)  FEBRUARY 28, 1780  The Importance and Necessity of a substantial Compliance with this Act of Congress are so obvious that nothing farther seems necessary to be added to excite the most vigorous Exertions on the part of the several States to carry the same into Execution.

8447,dg014517,1780,James Lovell to Samuel Adams,"""James Lovell to Samuel Adams   Dear Sir Feb. 28th. [1780] (1) The Report which I hinted at, to you in my last, has passed, and will doubtless be officially sent by the Post Tomorrow.(2) But, as Mr. Fessenden may get early to Boston, I inclose a Sketch which I made use of during the Debates. I do not chuse seperately from my Colleagues to descant upon the Principles of the Report. But I entreat that you would use your utmost Eloquence to promote this Business & every other essential to a vigorous Campaign. And I must confidentially entrust you with an Anecdote to prompt yr Zeal. The Chevalr. De la Luzerne, from the purest motives and a most cordial anxious Concern about the Affairs of America & the Alliance, was writing a circular Letter to the Govrs. & Presidts. of the respective States by way of friendly Stimulus, but his Delicacy led him to inclose his Sentiments to the Presidts that the Opinion of the Delegates might be had.(3) The Letter was a very good one, but the measure was not agreable, for several Reasons which an old Veteran, as you have been tautologically called, will easily conceive, at least upon casting yr. Eye FEBRUARY 28, 1780  over the 6th Article of the confederation. I own that I felt no zeal of Jealousy on this Occasion. But since the Matter has been agitated & delicately quashed. I hope there will not hereafter be any Room to say that Congress have not Influence with the States nor chuse to let the minister of France try his. He certainly has a Right to treat with particular States thro' Congress by the sd. 6th Article, in Implication. Surely then he may in that Chanel exhort & stimulate to the Fulfillment of measures recommended by Congress. However, This being not the Question now, I recur to my Entreaty that you would be earnest in promoting all measures for a vigorous Campaign. Tho' we were enjoyned Secresy; yet the minister had no Idea that the Governments of the States should not know that there is some probability of an armed Negociation; when, the Proposals made last yr. by Spain may be again advanced. The Enemy therefore should not be allowed to hold any Parts of the United States on the Day of Cessation of Hostilities. We may be assured of the Resources of the Realme of France being used for the Purposes of grand Diversions in our Favor as well as Cooperations here if we get into a Condition for Vigor. The order for this Day was to determine where we shall move to. That is put off for a Fortnight. I am well satisfied we shall not move at all.(4) Another order for this day was a report upon the Letter from our State; put off till Tomorrow It will cause much debating for I will strive to have something definite; whereas the Report touches only the charging all past Advances & Encreases of Pay as Deductions in the States Account against the Officers & Men. But it ought to be known whether the whole is to be a continental Expence.(5) I add herewith an Extract of the ministers Communications.(6) I give it to you as a Secret & no Secret to make the most judicious use of in yr. Power. I only say it is not a News Paper Business. Yrs. affectionately, J L 29th. Mr. Brailsford arrived this morning & has delivered a Letter with Instructions about the Penobscot affairs (7) & Col.

"
8451,dg014521,1780,to Richard Caswell,"""to Richard Caswell   Sir, Philadelphia Feby. 29th 1780. You will receive, from the President of Congress, sundry Resolutions which are the result of much deliberation; and such as the Necessity of our affairs, rather than choice, has determin[ed] us to adopt.(1) This Necessity arises from the state of our circulating currency; and from the impossibility of having recourse to further Emissions of paper on public Credit. The Currency is no longer capable of procuring any given quantity of Supplies; because, it is impossible to say what quantity of it will be Necessary for purchasing the Commodities required, whose prices rise beyond any imaginable proportion; and the press, being once shut up, cannot again be opened with any prospect of affording relief. The only resources, now, for furnishing the Supplies for the war, are the Contributions of the States, and what may be obtained by loans. The latter, after many trials, is found to yield but little aid, and that little, extremely burthensom to the Community. The former is the true and unfailing fountain of the Strength of a Nation, especially, a free One. But it is not in the power of Congress to call them forth, otherwise than by Requisitions to the Several States; and, if the States fail to comply, it will be utterly impossible to carry on the war. While Congress could raise supplies by means of Emissions on public Credit, a failure of Exertions in any one or more of the States would not have been fatal. But, since that can no longer be done, it is unquestionably clear that a failure in any State, who furnishes Considerable Supplies, might be attended with Consequences, in the last degree ruinous to the Cause we are engaged in; and which is now happily drawing to a glorious conclusion. In a word, Sir, the Exertions of Congress are no longer competent; and, unless the States exert themselves, the Cause is utterly lost; and we shall be left in a situation the most wretched among human beings-that is, exposed to all the Oppressions and Insults of enraged, Victorious, and avaricious Tyranny. FEBRUARY 29, 1780  It is much to be wished that the Contributions could be made in money, so as to answer the Exigencies of the war. Such a mode would be most easy in Execution, tho, perhaps, not equally easy and beneficial to the whole, for that part of the Community, which is near the prinicipal Scenes of Action, would be able to demand, and have, a greater proportion of the public money for their produce; and, of Course, pay their quotas with much greater ease than those more remote. So that, not only the difficulty of Contributing would be unequal, but the quantity of Contribution would be unequal also. Contributions in money must be always subject to this inequality, until some mode can be fallen upon for estimating the quotas in proportion to the value of the produce of labor; but this cannot be effected during the War. There is another objection to Contributions in money, at the present period, which renders it altogether ineffectual. So urgent, and incessant are the demands of the public, for Necessaries to support an Army, which must disband if not daily supplied, that those who pay taxes have it in their power to insist on any price they please, and, no doubt, will demand higher in proportion to the Tax they expect to pay. This alone is Sufficient to render the taxes unequal to the Supplies. But if to the force of this principle be added the force of that attention which each Individual has to his own Interest, and always determines the Selier to take advantage of the Necessity of the buyer, the force, also, of the abusive System of public purchasing, which, So long as our Necessity continues cannot be corrected, and of the fluctuation which the Events of War always produce in the hopes and fears of men, when all these, Sir, are added, their united Operation will render it impossible to make any given Sum of our Money represent a given quantity of any Commodity. Indeed we find, by experience, that all calculations of this kind are vain. For tho' the States should tax to the amount of all the Money in circulation, the urgency of the public demands, and the avarice of Individuals, would raise the prices to so enormous an heighth, before it could be collected, that the money would go but a very little way in purchasing supplies: so that tho' the Community should be oppressed by Taxes, the Necessary Articles for carrying on the war could not be obtained. The contributions of the States must necessarily be in the Specific commodities wanted for the Support of the war. The powers of Government which the States possess enable their magistrates to procure them by a variety of Means. They can be obtained on certificates redeemable at a Succeeding Assembly; for which redemption, a tax can be calculated, because, the purchase is previously made, and the price known; and the holder can discharge the Tax by those very certificates. Some can cause them to be collected by Specific Contribution; and Some, we hope, can obtain them by that most desireable mode of contracting. But, we need not suggest the vari-  ous modes; and our Anxiety for the Success of this most Necessary Measure, has carried us into the mentioning those few we have Suggested, not any opinion that the general assembly will have Occasion for our Advice in a matter, to which their own wisdom is, infinitely, more competent. We call it, Sir, a most Necessary Measure. We will venture to repeat that it is indispensible. We cannot See any thing that can be adopted, in lieu of it, that promises, even the most distant prospect of relief, and we hope from it, for many Essential advantages to the united States in general, and to our own in particular. As to the last, we shall only say that our Industry will be applied for the discharge of our part of the public burthens, at the Same rate with that of the other States, which our local disadvantages would prevent were we to pay in money only. As to the former, we hope the Measure will remove the public Necessity by the provision of Magazines previous to the want of them, that the Supplies, being furnished by all, and the remote coming in aid of those more near, will prevent that excessive demand, and excessive advantage taken of the public, which were the Consequences of procuring them only in the Neighborhood of the Army. That the evil of a numerous Staff department, established in such a manner as to enhance the most ruinous abuses, will be entirely removed. In a word Sir, will give us plenty of Supplies, without incurring heavy public debts; without giving partial advantages; without causing partial burthens; without leaving us exposed to the abuses of peculation, or danger to our affairs from the precarious Subsistance of our army. If these happy effects should flow from it, our resources will be as inexhaustible as our Industry. Money will attain to it's true use and value, for, in Ordinary Commerce, no individual can be under Such Necessity as the public who are maintaining a War for their very Existence. If prices of Necessaries continue high, those who want them must retrench in the use of them; or increase their Industry to enable them to purchase. The product of that Industry will no where find that Necessity which, at present, every one finds in the public. The market of high prices must be sought among the affluent, who will thus contribute to the support and increase of Industry, but, even among those, prices will find limits beyond which they cannot go; and commerce will so regulate itself (2) that even paper money, will find a Certain fixed value as the general representative of Industry-an Event which may in vain be looked for, so long as the Necessity of the public is Suffered to Continue, by neglecting or failing to foresee and provide for the demands before they arrive. On perusing the report it will be found that Congress have allowed liberal prices for every Article and all as Near as Could be in the same Proportions. The Prices of the year Seventy four were assumed from the best Information that could be obtained, and fifty per cent were added in Consideration of the particular Circumstances of the  War. The whole indeed will operate as a loan from the Staple States to the whole union of which they must afterwards be charged with their proportions And be creditors for the Surplus. The States who have not Staples, or fail to Supply, will be debtors to the whole Union. It will easily appear to you that it was Necessary to fix the prices in Specie because nothing that is fluctuating could measure either the whole of the amount of Supplies or the several [propo]rtional parts, and Consequently nothing else [could be] adopted for doing Justice to the whole or to each. You will find the quotas assigned to North and South Carolina far beyond what is their Supposed proportion but the prospect of a vigorous Campaign in the southern States, the probability of great Armaments being there employed the impossibility of Supplying them with provisions from any other States, with other reasons which will occur to you, determined the Delegates of those States to assume the quotas as they now are, and induced Congress to make the requisitions. The Same Considerations will explain the reasons for assigning the different Commodities as they appear in the Resolves. We shall only observe that North Carolina assumed the flower because South Carolina could furnish none, and the Troops from Virginia and North Carolina cannot be Subsisted upon rice. We will now Sir dismiss this subject first praying leave to press its importance in the most Strenuous Manner on the State General assembly. ""

This will be accompanied by the substance of a System, which lately passed Congress, for supplying the army. An exact copy will be transmitted by the President.(1) We are now upon a plan for giving stability to our money. As soon as any measures shall be agreed on We will give your excellency the earliest intelligence. Some time ago Congress had a conference with the minister of France, at his request,(2) by a Committee; when, among other things, he informed us that there was no prospect of a peace this spring, that France and Spain were making preparations for a powerful diversion and that it was expected on our part that we should exert ourselves with vigour this campaign. That successful operations would hasten and facilitate negotiations of peace &c &c. This is the substance of what we think ourselves now at liberty to communicate. We have lately received a letter from our minister at Paris; but not a word of news, saving that our Invoices for cloathing and military Stores had just arrived, and that he was encouraged to think that our application would meet with success. The King of Britain's speech is more moderate than usual; but he is still determined it seems to prosecute the war with vigour. It is our duty to be prepared to resist his efforts, and to regain the possession of such parts of the United States as the enemy have taken from us, if we can. This we should be able to effect if we had a naval force superior to that of the enemy; but our own naval force is weak and what force our ally will have in America the ensueing campaign we know not. Count De Estaing with 12 sail of ships are gone to France. It is said that on his passage he had taken a 64 gun-ship and a frigate but I believe this account is uncertain. We presume that their places will be supplied, because we cannot conceive that our Ally will leave the W. Indias exposed. No certain intelligence hath yet come to hand relating to the famous York fleet. They have been seen at sea. Yesterday a letter was received by a merchant in this place from one of his captains who had just  MARCH 3, 1780  arrived in Chesapeak from the W. Indias, informing him that in lat: 28 long: 68 he had come across a transport which was one of that fleet, that had been wrecked by a storm & that he had taken out the men and left her. That Clinton & Cornwallis were on board the fleet and that it was hound to Georgia. Inclosed will be a news paper which will give you all the flying news.

8459,dg014529,1780,James Lovell to Horatio Gates,"""James Lovell to Horatio Gates   Dear Sir Feb. [i.e., March] 4th. 1780 (1) It is only because Col. Bull was so obliging as to promise to call on me this morning for a Letter, that I now take up my Pen, for it is impossible for me to write with any Deliberations, having two Expresses to attend to immediately. Yr. Favor of Feby 17th with L's (2) Instructions are on my Table. Verily I cannot conceive he acted from any other Principles than what he avers; and I ought in Charity for Congress to suppose that the Word Protection will fairly admit of the Ideas usually annexed to \""Aids by Treaty\"" otherwise their Honors have been over free in the Use of it during the Honey Moon of our late interesting Alliance. However I will consider this matter a little more maturely. You will really be surprized when you [get] to See L's last Letter to Congress. I did not imagine he would write so confessionary an Epistle to any Potentate on Earth. His first is published Jany. 10th, his 2d will be in the Feby Journal. I did not know but some Persons might chuse to have by them the Treaties in French, the Language in which they were originally drawn up; therefore I made the Printer bind a few of the Sheets which he had struck off, but was forbidden to insert in the 4th Vol. of the Journals; you can accent them with a fine nibbed pen.(3) The Printer had no Tipes for that Purpose. P.M. I was interrupted this Morning by the Arrival of a large Mail from France by the Mercury after a long Passage.(4) We had later News before. I hope we shall get Supplies of Arms & Amunition early. There is the fairest Prospect. Indeed, we could make out pretty well with our own Magazines. We could by the 1 st of May get ready 10,000 including 1600 Queen Ann's, which would serve at West Point. But, the Money! General, the Money! Speculators are 8 times over match for us. As to Massachusetts God knows where they will find the Cartloads; but they have determind to make good the original Contract of Congress with both officers & Men for 3 years back; and to be governed in future by the same Scale which regulates them for the Past-the monthly Average of the Prices of Beef, Indian Corn, Sheeps Wool, and Sole Leather.  MARCH 4, 1780  I think I mentioned to you some time ago that we ought to be guarding against an Event not improbable which is an armed Negociation wherein the Terms offered by Spain last year may be again renewed by others as reasonable proposals vizt. Each to hold what they possess on the Day of the Commencement of a long Truce. France & Spain will make powerful combined Diversions to favor us if they should not be also able to cooperate in these Parts. It is reported that Sr. Henry was not heard of at Carolina on the 10th of February. The Express who brought my Packet in 14 days from Boston tells me that as he passed thro' Connecticutt he was told that Genl. Putnam had been taken off by a Fit of some Kind, but whether Convulsions or Apoplexy he could not remember.(5) Our Boston Papers rarely come to hand of late, and are chiefly Advertizements when they do reach us. As I am uncertain whether I shall print what Doctr. Franklin mentions of Portugal, I give it to you in Extract.(6) Passy Octr. 4. 79 \""Portugal seems to have a better Disposition towards us than heretofore. about 30 of our People taken & set ashore on one of her Islands by the English were maintained comfortably by the Governer during their Stay then furnished with every Necessary, and Sent to Lisbon; where, on Enquiry to whom Payment was to be made for the Expence they had occasioned, they were told that no Reimbursement was expected, that it was the Queen's Bounty who had a Pleasure in showing Hospitality to Strangers in Distress. I have presented Thanks, by the Portugaise Ambassador here, in Behalf of the Congress. and I am given to understand that probably in a little Time the Ports of that Nation will be open to us as those of Spain.\"" Arthur Lee was in Paris Decr. 8th.(7) I doubt not he is now on his Way to America, for there is Reason to think Mr. J. Adams arrived soon after that Date. I fear he will never get any Redress from Deane who will take Care to miss him in both Countries. The Letter which I forward is from Count Montford,(8) as I judge by the handwriting & Size resembling several others which have been opened. He meant well in what he has published though there is nothing very smart or substantial in it. He had a hard boat to steer if he means again to appear as an Officer in America. He has met with some considerable Windfalls on the Decease of a Grandfather & Sister. Conway has a Regiment. I have Dispatches to prepare in Consequence of the new arrival this morning, which addition to the Labors announced when I first took up my Pen must plead my Excuse for not noticing particularly what have written heretofore about Canada & other Subjects.

8461,dg014531,1780,John Fell to Robert Morris,"""John Fell to Robert Morris   Dear sir, Philada. March 5th. 1780 Yesterday I was favourd with yours of the 1st & 2d Instt. relateing chiefly to the truely distresting situation of our unhappy State. Your feelings on this occasion, may in some measure make you senseable of what ours must be hear, When the dispatches from 30 many quarters and departments, all breathing their different complaints and wants, requires great fortitude indeed, to bear up, under the weight. As I am engaged, I am not willing to speak, but Assist with my slender Shoulder to the Yoke though I am fearfull it will not avail much. Look which way you will every thing seems to wear a bad aspect, I would not be understood to mean by the looks or actions of the People hear, for it is quite the reverse, disappation and extravigence of all kinds are beyond conception. The dress now of the Ladies in Paying their Visits is quite equal, to the dress of the Ladies that I have seen in the Boxes in the Playhouses in London, and their dress in general even along the Streets, Resembles in a great degree, the Actresses on the Stage. I suppose from these Reflections you will conclude, I write like an Old fellow, who cannot make Proper allowances, but I ashure you that is not the Case. I never had any of them scruples about dress when it was done with Propriety. Our extravigence is even look't on abroad with contempt. Yesterday a Letter from Dr Franklin was read, (1) wherein he expresses his sorrow, for what he hears of us, in that Respect, and says he has a Proof of it, by the Bills drawn on him for the Interest of the Certifficates, which he understands is chiefly orderd to be laid out in the Purchase of Tea and other triffling articles of extraviegence. Congress has been some time in a Committe of the whole to consider a Report of a Committee on Supplies for the Treasury,(2) That the States be calld upon to make Provision for sinking by Taxes, Loans, Exchange or otherwise in the course of the Present Year their quotas now in circulation viz. New Hampshire &c &c 200,000,000 Million. Each State to be charg'd in debt for its Quota in Spanish Milld dolls. at the Exchange of 40 for 1 with Interest at 6 Per Cent Per Annum and be Credited in Spanish Milld dolls at the same Rate of exchange for said Bills as they shall be brought to be destroyed, NB now I have begun I believe it will be less trouble to give you the whole then to curtail it. That it be reccomended to the States as the Bills are drawn out of circulation to emitt Bills on their own Credt. redeemable in Specie within 7 Years not exceeding on any Acct the quotas of 10,000,000 Dolls' not to be Isued more than 1/20th Part so fast as the other Bills shall be brought in to be destroyd and that they establish funds for the Redemption of the Bills they shall Emit. MARCH 5, 1780  I grow tired giving you the whole as I do not like any Part of it. As to the different States Emitting their own Bills I do dislike exceedingly, as I am sure that would be Productive of the greatest confusion. As to the Specie Plan, I should have no objection to if it were Practible or Posible to comply with it, but where is New Jersey to get her Part of 500,000 dollars in Specie for her Quotas. I imagine there is as little Specie in that State as any, one reason they have had more Prisoners with the Enemy, which has been a great drain to their friends of all the hard stuff they could get, another reason with me is from their Vicinity to New York, there has been a great European Trade carried on which has been another drain. However you will agree with me, that it is much easier to find fault than to Propose any thing new that will answer the end. As to Projecting Schemes on financing I have no Pretentions that way; If any thing new offers to morrow on this subject I will let you know. I have two affairs in New Jersey that I want your advice about. One is about the Estate of Henry Caylor deceasd and the other Jos Forman, of whom I have a Mortgage of some Land, I beleave near Allen Town, I think the Papers are in the hands of Henry Waddell Esqr. I wish you would repeal that wicked Tender Law, though I had a hand in the making of it, for instance if I was to attempt to Recover either of the above I suppose they would Pay me off immediately; I have done my endeavour in Congress to get a requisition to the States to Repeal or revise the Law, the Opposition think it has done all the hurt it can, and that now only Tories will benifitt by it. I cannot see it in that light, however there is a Report from a Committee now on the Table on the subject, and was Postponed to take up the Plan now before us. Now I much want your advice and friendly assistance with regard to [My]Self. As I can safely say, and that without flattery there is no Person in New Jersey in whose opinion I have a greater Esteem. Money you know is the Principle mover. I should be glad to know how I am to recover £500 which I have spent last Year more than my allowance, in absolute necessary Expences, only the Taylors Bill for making One Coat & Breeches, and some Shoes all the rest such expences as were dayly wanted and not One Botle of Wine nor One Shilling spent in Tavern. This Year is to be £20. will that be more then 20 dollars last Year. I doubt it much, however I hope you will write me on the subject and your opinion of the Propriety of my Resigning As I am too much Reduce'd to be able to live hear at my Own Expence. However notwithstanding all these complaints I have given orders for a Cask of Madeira Wine that will hold about 5 Galls. and Cost £50 a Gall, What do you think of that. (I hope it will be better then taking Bark.) What is your opinion of Justice and the faith of the Nation with regard to realizeing the money, would it be right that a Countryman that makes you Pay 60 Dolls for a Turkey in the market, and at the   same time tells you it is only 60 Pence should have his money realized, Or the Butcher that sold his fatt Cow, Yesterday at 20 Dollors a Pound, in that case his Cow would be worth as much as One of the Grand Moguls Eliphants. Or the Landlord that was paid last week for the Rent of a house £300 at the moderate Excha[nge] of 55 for 1. Or the Lawyer who asks you £100 Sterlg for a fee or in Contl at the Exchange. And yet on the other hand there are doubtless many instances were justice only requires it. I expect I shall tire you out before you have read all my nonsence, but I have not done yet. What think you of The Honble Silas Condict being appointed Quarter Master General.(3) Quere would not his Friend General Winds have understood the Business as well. I have not heard from Petersfield in several weeks & I am greatly distressed on the Account; If I had a Horse I believe I should be tempted to goe to see what was become of Mrs Fell and Son Peter. A number of Vessells have come up Yesterday and to day, what Effect it will have on the money I know not, but it seems to be agreed on all hands that money is very scarse hear at Present, A very droll circumstance of One of the Vessells from Cadiz, having along Passage and bad weather had been oblidged to throw her Guns over Board, came up with a Snow of 10 Guns which he boarded and took, and after getting the Guns on Board his own Vessell, he took a Brig, both said to be valuable Cargoes, The Watchman say it is Past 10 o Clock, time to goe to Bedd, so Adieu, Good night. Monday morning [i.e., March 6]. I forgot to tell you last night, when I was out I heard there was letters come from So Carolina on the 10th Feby no account then of the arrival of the British Fleet. On Saturday Congress agreed not to draw any more Bills on Europe till further orders;(4) I have been uniform in opposing the Plan of drawing Bills from the first time it was mentiond for several reasons. P.M. This day has been taken up chiefly in dispatches from Major [General] Lincoln dated the 31st Jany.(5) He says on hearing of the Fleet on the Coast he sent out two frigates, who went and lookt in the River at Georgia where they see 5 Ships which they took to be line of Batle, One of which had an Admirals flag and I think about 14 Sail of other Vessells, but on seeing the Ships, Prepairing to make Sail they made the best of their way to Charlestown agreeable to their orders, they took 2 or 3 Vessells with 40 Dragoons and some Officers. One of the Vessells had had 45 Horses on Board, but had thrown 43 Over Board. 1000 of the No Carolina Militia were arrived and the Express who did not leave Charlestown till the 7th February says General Hogan with his Continental Troops, and Coll Washington with his horse were about 100 Mile off on their way and that several Vessells had arriv'd at Charlestown before he came a way from St.  Eustatia with stores &c for the Garrison.

I had the honor of addressing you a few days since with my colleagues upon public business, which I hope came safe to hand.(1) The British King has not thought proper to mention America in his late speech; I am at no loss how to acct. for it in my own mind, for if he had observed upon the state of this Country as being in rebellion, I have no reason to think it wou'd be likely to answer a valuable purpose for him, at the several Courts in Europe at this day. His  MARCH 6, 1780  holding up his own immediate danger (no doubt) he apprehended wou'd be more likely to prevail with some of the powers in Europe to assist him, at least, to become mediators; and if they should, and the terms proposed by them cou'd not be complied with by Congress and her ally, the mediating powers would join with him in the war; altho' he may have no expectation of subjugating America, yet he will be very loth that we should continue sovereign & independent, or treat with us as such, and if he should be brought to treat with America as Independent; I suppose he will insist upon holding such parts of the united states, as his armies may be then in possession of; If this may be considered as the state of our national affairs in Europe, it must appear evident that all the exertions in our power ought to be made to drive the enemy from every part of these states. The enhanced prices of all the necessaries of life, the great demands for money, and the exhausted state of the public treasury, greatly embarrasses our affairs; how far it is in the power of the Honble. Court to assist Congress, or what sums of money the good people can pay in, is best known to their immediate Representatives; But surely these are matters that require the greatest care & attention, as well as exertions. By letters from General Lincoln dated the 31st of January, (2) which came to hand this day, we are informed that the enemy have arrived in force, in the state of Georgia, but have no particulars as to their numbers; It is supposed to be the Fleet that sailed from New York some time since. Congress have resolved to recommend to the several states, to set apart the last Wednesday in April next, as a day of fasting, humiliation and prayer. I have the Honor to be, with the highest sentiment of respect, Sir, your most obedient servant, S. Holten ""

8464,dg014534,1780,William Churchill Houston to Robert Morris,"""William Churchill Houston to Robert Morris   Dear Sir, Philadelphia 6 March 1780 Looking over my File of unanswered Letters I am really ashamed to find how deeply I have [suffered my self to fall in your Debt. Your several obliging Favours of December 19 and 26 and 8 February last and 1 March instant are now before me, and if it is in my Power to keep my Hand to the Paper without Interruption for an Hour, I will endeavour to pay, in Quantity at least. It was my Inten- MARCH 6, 1780  tion to have lessened the Amount on my return from Princeton, but found the Court of Admiralty had detained you at Allenton; and being afraid that the Ice from above would interrupt the Passage at Howell's Ferry, the only one near, which was passable, I was fain to get [here on?] Monday Morning. I have not failed duly to warn Congress that the whole, and much less two Thirds, of our Tax will not buy the Supplies for the Army, which must come from the State. They are not insensible of this, but they do not wish to make Exceptions, lest others, who will not have the same Reason, should wish to retain the Whole of their Tax, and it is not unknown to you how absurd People can and will argue when themselves are interested. You may rest assured that not only the whole will be given up, if necessary, but Money will be advanced if in our Power, and to me it is clear that if the Army keep their present Position it will be wanted, e[speciall]y if the Crops are good the coming Season. But from the States at a Distance from the Operations of the War, little will be wanted, except for marching Troops, unless it be of such a Nature as will bear distant Transportation. The Clothing and Sutlery furnished the Troops I find by Mr. Kelsey run very high, and it seems that when the Clothier General, this last Distribution, came to examine the Continental Stock and what each State had procured, he said New-Jersey came nearer to clothing their Troops than most of the other States after adding what Share he had for them, so that I believe we got Little or Nothing from him. This is a great Credit to us, but runs away with our Money and still the whole Brigade is not fully furnished. [It is] to be hoped that our Militia will not be so expensive to us as it has been, the Enemy being weaker at New-York, and the Army in the Vicinity of our Lines throughout a considerable Extent of them, and I have always thought that a smaller Number than we have employed generally, especially if a Proportion of them were active Horse, would answer the Purpose as well as more. The Vermont Business which was to have come on 1st February ulto has been staved off, as New-York and Massachusetts-Bay were not fully prepared. New York is now ready, and as Massachusetts will probably wave their Claim, or dispute it afterwards with the prevailing Party of the two, the matter is ordered to come on Tomorrow without further postponing. Three Agents from Vermont attended on the 1st of February, but as they claimed to be admitted to support their Pretensions in the Capacity of a free and independent State, and did not submit the Matter on other Grounds, agreeably to the Resolutions of Congress of 14 September last, they staid but a little Time and then returned. I am with you in Apprehensions that this Contest will be extremely troublesome before it is issued, though I do not think that quite all those who are now peaceable and obedient Subjects of the new State will choose to carry the Matter to Extremities. One Thing surprises me in the Delegates of New York,   and I cannot help reminding them of it now, and then, they talk of the Vermont-people as Great-Britain does of us, that not a third of the People are in the Interest of the new Government, that two Thirds or three fourths are friendly to New York. This is either pretended putting the best Face on the Matter, or is a fond Deception. It is a childish Idea that a Majority in any Country, where Equality of Condition and Improvement prevails, should be governed by a Minority. I almost venture to say it cannot happen anywhere, but in this Case I am certain. Many however may turn about and prefer returning to the Jurisdiction of New York before going to Blows, and in this respect I have some little Hopes. But should they generally persist as strongly as many of them seem to intend, it is not the Power of the State of New-York that can compose the revolt without serious Bloodshed. It may be possible to end the Matter amicably. New-York certainly offers generous Terms, peaceable Possession to every Man of what he has as a Farm and Habitation without Challenge or Incumbrance, and I think if they had offered this sooner, the Animosity [would] never have burned so strongly, nor run to such a Length. I approve these Terms of New-York, but I will remember what I thought some years ago, that if I were oppressed by a Set of Landjobbers and Aristocratical Gentry as those People were, I would die in the last Ditch rather than succumb to it. Mr. Clark has been with us since the 25th of January last.(1) I flatter myself that he will not be beside the Point in Matters respecting the Confederation, for I often hear him say that though he thinks the State of publick Affairs requires it's ratification, and postponing it to the Arrival of Peace will leave the States in Danger of a dreadful Separation, yet as to the leading Objections which New Jersey has made to it, they are clearly right, and ought to be contended on every Occasion when the general Good will be promoted by it. I write in Confidence, and take the Liberty to say on what you mention as to former Connections, that the old Leaven is not altogether gone from among us though it rarely appears, and a very desirable Harmony prevails in Congress at present. It is mortifying to recollect how much Time those Animosities have cost. I am of the same Opinion I was when I wrote to the Legislature early after my coming to Congress, which you will see on the Files of the Assembly; and as I feel myself entirely neutral as to Party in every Respect, I am determined to be on my Guard as long as I have a Part in the repre[sentation], and to support that Character against every Bias, on Subjects of the Nature referred to. As to the Question mentioned in yours of the 19 Decr. last and more particularly pursued in that of the 8th ulto, it is a Matter on which, all Things considered, the Decision is very difficult. Whether we had better contend for our Right to the Proceeds of what were called the Crown-lands on United or Confederated Ground?(2) The Reasons you give for taking the former in Preference before the latter  are solid, but as usually happens in such Cases the other Side is not without Somewhat to say. I am still in the Situation I was when I wrote you first, undecided and querying. I am not of Opinion that the Confederation guarantees to the States any Bounds, and much less Bounds which they may claim ad Libitum without any formal Decision or Control. In our United State no Measure can be taken for the Circumscription, with any Tolerable Prospect of Success; I am convinced of this from the Temper I have seen discovered in Discussions of the Subject in Congress, and Claims are set up which I am well persuaded cannot be countenanced by any Documents in the Hands of the Claimants: but confederated, I must take the Liberty of saying Congress of Right might bring any State to shew their Grounds of Claims and decide whether the Union ought to recognize and defend the Extent to which they go. It is doubtless a Defect in the Confederation that no Mode is laid down for deciding between the United States and any one of them, in a Matter of this Kind, as well as between any two or more States where a Difference subsists as to Boundary; but this must be taken as inc[. . .to the?] Constitution of the Confederation, it being clear to me that there is within the Limits of the whole Confederacy Lands to which no particular State can shew any Title: and if there is one Mile square there may be a Million, and as no Right can subsist without a remedy of obtaining it, it is proper to make the Search, and to take the means for doing so. Suffer me to state three or four Particulars. 1. The United States are not in Capacity to take or hold Lands. They are associated for Defense and carrying on the War. Do the Acts and Instructions of the several States from which the Deputies come extend to any other Object but this, and those collateral and necessarily incident to it? And on this Footing I have ever opposed all Propositions for purchasing real Property as a Congress, and particularly in a late Instance in which a Proposal was made to sell to the Union the Estate upon which the Fortifications at West-point are erected.(3) 2. Pursuing this Idea were there a Territory acknowledged to [. . .] be out of the ownership or Claim of any particular State in the Union, are the United States assembled in Congress constituted or authorised to dispose of it? Or had they a Claim to Land or Territory in any State are they a Person or Body politick to pursue it? In my View, they are at present [under a] mere temporary Association, confederated they would stand on different Ground. 3. You see by the Act I sent you of 19 February last, passed in the State of New-York,(4) that there is a Disposition in that State to have their Limits ascertained, and in Order to satisfy the Discontents of many of their Sister-states they may be disposed to do what is reasonable. Their Example may be followed by other States, and though it may be said this will be more likely to be the Case before the Completion of the Confederation than after; as seems to be your Opinion; I confess it does not strike me, but that there will be a better Disposition to it then than now, while Jealousy   and Irritation is so apt to take Place, and no Person Seems to feel any Security that if they give up a Part the rest will be Secured to them by a solemn federal guaranty. 4. It seems clear to me that Virginia, the Carolinas and Georgia will find their Interest in deserting a Part of their present Pretensions, and agreeing to a moderate Boundary for the Sake of interesting the rest of the Union to support them, or if they claim the Continuance of the Jurisdiction they will be inclined to relinquish the Property. It is not unknown to you that there is an extensive Territory on the Western Parts of those States which was heretofore of disputed Right between Great Britain and The Family Compact. I am not [sure] whether France or Spain, probably France who releas[ed] to Spain. The Crown of Great Britain in 1763 by Proclamation forbid the Location or Settlement of those Lands, and it is beyond a Doubt that if the Spaniards were disposed they might set up a Claim to them. In such Case Nothing but the Interest of the Union could avail to produce a relinquishment, and no rational thinking Person could expect that this would be cordially interposed for the exclusive Emolument of two or three States. However these Things I say to you in Confidence, and beg you will receive them under an Injunction of the closest Discretion. I could add somewhat further, but you would disapprove of my hinting at Matters which are not Mature for the Light. You will not mistake me, and set it down as my Opinion that it would be best first to confederate and then move in the Prosecution of our right. I had much rather the latter were done first, but my Idea is that the former would not render the latter altogether impracticable, and shut up every Prospect of Justice. That right will some how or other take Place, I am clear; because our Pretension is just. I am but a young Man, and younger in publick Business than in Life, but this I have observed, not only in reading but in Experience, that right and Truth do finally prevail, and on this idea my Confidence is rested. Persons of the best Wisdom and Forecast wish a Circumscription of Boundaries to take Place.(5) ""

Every reflection Sir, I have made, since the receipt of Your Excellencys letter of the 24th January, on the appointment mentioned In It has Confirmed the conclusion I very Early drew that I could not Consistently with my honor and reputation accept of any employment under Congress In a Station rather less honorable or less Important than that which I once had the honor to hold, And when the Circumstances which led to my quitting the Army shall recur to Congress, I trust they will acquiesce In the Justness and propriety of this determination on my part. I do not mean Sir to Convey the most distant Idea that I Sollicit a restoration to the rank and place I held In the Army; It is true that I quitted It with reluctance and that I have often since Comented that I was drove to the necessity of doing It. Yet the delicacy I entertain with respect to the feelings of others who might possibly conceive themselves Injured by a perfect restoration of my rank, Added to other Considerations have Induced me to lay aside every wish for a reappointment. But Sir as I am Incapable of witholding any Services my Country may deem me Capable of rendering, as a reform In the Civil departments of the Army is of the highest necessity and as Congress have thought proper to apply to me for my Aid on the Occasion permit me to tender them an offer of my services as a member of their house on a Committee to Consult with the Commander In Chief and the heads of the several civil departments of the Army, and to Adopt such Measures as will have a probable tendency to compleat the great Object of the resolution of the 20th January; As a member of such a Committee I should Esteem It my duty to visit every part of the Continent for the purpose of Introducing good order and a proper ceconomy and Should deem myself fully rewarded for every possible exertion In the Success of the business and the Approbation of Congress.

8487,dg014557,1780,Philip Schuyler to Jacob Cuyler,"""Philip Schuyler to Jacob Cuyler?   Dear Sir,(1) Copy No. 2 Philadelphia March 11th. 1780 I arrived here on Sunday, on Monday I advised Congress, that I could not consistent with my honor serve under the appointment they had been pleased to make. The other Commissioners were ordered to proceed in the business, but intimations having been given that my Aid was necessary, a Committee was appointed and I put on it. As this does not comport with my Ideas of propriety I continue to refuse. Men of Sentiment approve my firmness and delicacy, others are chagrined but dare not drive me to a pointed explanation, which I will never give otherwise than in writing, that my Constituents and all my Countrymen may see my Principles. The subject of Finance has for some time past engrossed the attention of Congress in a Committee of the whole, but paradoxical as it may seem, that a part should be more competent than the whole, it has been thought necessary to refer the business to a lesser Committee, composed of Burck, Elsworth, Holtn, Haustin [Houston], Livingston and Scuyler, a Report will probably be compleated by Monday, my object is a fixture of the present Circulating Medium at a given ratio calling it in, speedily destroying it, a new Emission quoted to States and sent forth on permanent funds, the Quantum to be emitted to be proportioned to the periodical destruction of the present Bills, the new ones to bear a Specie Interest payable at their redemption or in bills on France at the option of the holders. I believe the reports will bear this Complexion, but what transformation it will undergo in the House is impossible to determine, as every Man wishes to be thought a Financier and must have his Ideas. It will probably be like Joseph's coat a composition of patches party coloured. I can say nothing yet about Your Department, a few days will enable me to do it, and You will have the necessary communications, as far as shall be in my power to afford them, the Vermont business is not yet on the Tapis. If my Financing Ideas should prevail our State will be able to extricate itself out of its difficulties without continuing the Burden of Taxes, Provided always that our Legislature will be prudent and decisive, and that Men of considerable property will do their duty; altho I am amongst the middling Class of these, I propose to rob them all of the honor of being the first to set a good example; this is perfectly Enigmatical at present to You, and so it must continue, until I am at liberty more fully to explain myself. You that love Your Country shall follow me, at least I will give You an opportunity of doing it at the Risque of our property, may be a little, but the Sacrifice will be glorious, and perhaps too our Countrymen may honor us with the all endearing name of true and Virtuous patriots. That You, I, and all like us, and all our more distressed Fellow Citizens  MARCH 12, 1780  may truly deserve that pleasing appellation is my sincerest wish, my fervent prayer, Adieu, my friend, and believe me to be sincerely such, Ph.

However if we can hold out a little longer we have a hope in Pro[v]idence yet for Yesterday a Committee brought in a draft of a proclamation for a Fast &c on Wednesday 26th of April, which was Read;(2) I thought there was an omition and moved for an amendment, which was inserted, but it seems I Laugh'd at the time, for which Mr Clark seemd much displeasd with me, however he got up and said he thought some of us, acted like Infidells (I suppose he meant me). Tomorrow is the day fixt for Congress to determine, whether they will adjourn from Philadelphia. It is also the order of the day (but I do not remember wheth[er] I wrote you last week). The great and Important day, big with the Fate of the People, of the New Hampshire Grants (Alias the State of Vermont) Neither of which I imagine will come to any thing determinate. Yesterday a Report of a Committee, for Reccomending to the several States, the Revising or Repealing the Tender Law as it is calld,(3) And though I was one that gave my Assent to it, I think it has been Productive of more mischief in its MARCH 12. 1780  Effects, then any one Act that ever was Past, I can speak from woefull experiance.

I return to close my Letter to you after the Lapse of a Week. You will excuse it however when I inform you that every waking moment of that Time I have been totally immersed in attending to a subject of the first Magnitude to the Union, the State of the Paper Currency. I have, I take the Liberty to say, faithfully attended a Committee appointed to that Duty from which my Mind has not been detached even while I have slept. I earnestly hope the Legislature will not rise till they hear from us on this Subject. The report is going through a Committee of the whole, and I hope this week will finish and put it into your Hands. I hope good things from [it] if the States will join [. . .] Support, without whom what is Congress? I wrote the Governour and the Speaker pretty fully relative to the Acceptance of Certificates in the Payment of Taxes,(1) if it can possi- MARCH 13, 1780  bly be avoided it is dangerous to meddle with it, and if at all, I would avoid the printed ones in the Quarter-Master's Department, because it must derange the settlement of his Accounts, and may be attended with great mischeifs, and perhaps double Payments. What you write me in yours of the 1st instant really surprises me. A requisition for so large a Quantity of Forage is rather suspicious. The General must have been misinformed, or Biddle (2) cannot have the Orders he announces. I am afraid strange Practisings and Artifices are made Use of by some who do not wish well to Alterations in the Systems of the Departments. I have this Day been informed there is a large Quantity of Forage at Coryell's Ferry, and also at a Mill in Spotswood quite within the reach of the Enemy. I do not know how to account for many Things which I see, notwithstanding I have not [any] intention but Charity. If there is any Thing left in New Jersey which can be of Use to the Army, I hope you will have it in the Way of being drawn out. Pennsylvania is really very slow, though I hope when they do begin they will do Something. Is your purchasing Law of 25 December last to be revised this Sitting? It is my sincere Opinion that one Purchaser in a County is quite enough, and that more will do Mischief instead of Service; and this one ought to be restricted to his County. There is a very deserving Man I wish were employed as a Purchaser in the County of Middlesex, I am intimately acquainted with him and know him to be a Man of Education, Parts and Business. In the Turns of the Times he is out of Employment and therefore would attend solely to this. I mean Jonathan Baldwin, Esqr of Princeton and believe he is not altogether unknown to you. I never was fond of recommendations, but I should not hesitate to recommend him. We have no authentick News from the Southward since the 6 February when all was well. Reports tell us that Charlestown is taken, and Porto Rico in the West Indies. These I regard as idle Tales. If it is so we [had] not Time to know it nor have they [. . .] but my Fears are not unalarmed about the Events of that Quarter.

8493,dg014563,1780,Nathaniel Peabody to Meshech Weare,"""Nathaniel Peabody to Meshech Weare   Sir, Philada. 13th March 1780 You will doubtless have the resolutions of Congress respecting the Quotas of men and Supplies, to be furnished by the respective States, officially transmitted (1) to you previous to the receipt of this Letter and on the 4th Instant the delegates of N Hampr. did themselves the Honr. of inclosing you Extracts from Communications lately made by the Minister of France;(2) as also the answer Congress made to those Communications-by all which you will be able to form Some Idea of the Necessary Measures to be taken for the ensuing Campaign, as also the Situation, and views of the Allied Powers. MARCH 13, 1780  The Numbers of men assign'd for New Hamp. to furnish is about one 6th part more, in my opinion, than would be their Just Quota. Yet as Congress did on the 9th ulto Resolve \""That the reasonable expence any State hath incur'd or may incur by raising and having in the Continental Army more than what shall hereafter appear to have been their Just proportions of the Troops Actually serving in the Said Army from time to time, Shall be allowed to Such States & Equitably adjusted in a final Settlement of their account with the United States\"" the Injury will not be so great, or in other words, a prospect of future Justice will make the present Grievance more Tolerable. As to the apportionment, and prices, of supplies, appear to me an Object of Very Great magnitude and ought to be thoroughly investigated-Tho' I cannot say the amount of Supplies alloted to New Hampr. to furnish, Estimated at the rates affixed to them, very far exceeds their due proportion, Yet I must Confess I feel no Small degree of Anxiety when I take a short retrospect of the various manners practiced in order to obtain those resolutions Especially that for affixing prices; which must evidently appear to every impartial person, well acquainted with the rates at which those articles were formerly or are at the present day, usually Sold in the Various parts of the Continent respectively Calld upon to furnish the same, it was by no means founded upon those Just and impartial principles of equallity & reciprocity which ought, at all times, to Govern in every important decision, as being the only Sure means of Cementing the Union of these States, or whereby a Nation can ever rationally expect to be Exalted. The ratio by which those prices in Specie were pretended to have been determined was for all Articles of American produce at 50 per Cent advance upon the prices Such articles were usually Sold for at the places of delivery, in the respective States in the year 1774-And Articles Imported from foreign ports in the same proportion with a reasonable additional Allowance for the Charge and risk of Importation. Let us now examine how far this Rule has been observed? Indian Corn in the Southern States was formerly Sold at from 21 to 24 90ths of a Dollar per Bushel, it is now rated at 67 1/2 90ths which instead of being 50, is 200 per Cent advance. Rye, Oats, and Many Other Articles of short forage nearly in the same proportion! The price of the best first Crop hay at the Market was formerly about 6, or 7 Dollars per Ton, it is now rated at more than Cent. per Cent.(3) advance above the former prices. The price of Merchantable flour in this City was formerly about Two Dollars per Cwt, Tho it was often Lower, Now rated at 4 Dollars & 1/2, which is 125 per Cent advance, but enough has been said to shew that Such States, whose distance from the Theatre of War, or other Circumstances, will not Admit of furnishing their proportions of these and many other  MARCH 13. 1780  articles rated in a Similar manner, will be Charged in a Specie Account from 100 to 150 per Cent advance above the former prices upon an average. And it ought to be here Observed the various articles were assigned to the respective States previous to affixing the prices. Let us now pay a Short visit to the Eastward, Say New Hampshire. Their delegates Consented to the article of beef, or other meat Equivalent Supposing it possible to furnish that Article. They also Consented to Some part of the Article of Rum, not doubting but the price of both Articles woud be rated in Just proportion, with other Articles of Supplies Calld for, and in hopes as the Sea Port there was open, it might be in the Power of the State to furnish at lest a part of the Rum, but at the same time, they were the rather induced to Consent to that article, for want of ability to furnish others, and more Necessary Supplies, and apprehending, also, that a failure in furnishing this Rum, would not be attended with so disagreable Consequences to the public, as a failure in many other Articles of Supplies, And of course the State would Escape the most pointed Censures Consequent upon such neglect though unavoidable. But to the point-It is now time to enquire how and in what manner that State is to discharge it Self from the enormous Debt brot. upon her by Consequence of the high, and unequal, prices affixed as aforsd? By furnishing grass fed beef at 5 & 1/2 Dollars per Hundred wt. I mention Grass fed because those who woud wish to keep their Cattle till after the first of December for a higher price must begin to feed with Corn and other dry forrage, by reason of the Winter Setting in, at least a month earlier there, than in Connecticut and the States to the Southward-which will be Such an additional & partial Expence I expect very little beef will be furnished from that State after the 1st of November. The price of Good beef at that Season of the Year was heretofore usually about four Dollars per Hundred wt.-And is now rated at five and a half Dollars per Cwt. which is not 40 per Cent advance from the Old price. And as to the Rum though I by no means pretend to be Master of Merchantile affairs Yet I will Venture to assert that no Man can import that article, at this day, by exporting flour at the price affix'd, so as to be able to Sell the Rum here under about 2 Dollars & 3/4ths or three Dollars per Gallon, if he can for that. The present rule of barter here, is from a Gallon to a Gallon & a half of rum for one hundred of flour, hence it is obvious that my calculation upon this Article is well founded. And that New Hampshire must furnish Supplies at a very Great loss, when compared with the allowances made for most part of the articles to be furnished by other States, or Else be Charged in an immoderate Specie Debt to the United States, upon interest, that will not only far exceed their Just proportion of the Necessary Expence of furnishing such Supplies but their ability to discharge! The loss that New Hampshire will Sustain upon a moderate Calculation by the unequal manner in  which those prices are affixed upon the Supplies, Call'd for the Current Year will amount at least to 50,000 Dollars in Specie while other States differently Circumstanced will gain in proportion to your Loss, and which mode if Continued but for a few years will entirely mortgage the State. Upon this view of Things you will pardon me if, as a Citizen, I venture to express my Sentiments upon a Subject So vastly important in its Consequences And which so Essencially effects the Interest of a State I have the honr to represent. And hope it will not be conceived that I have the most distant wish to retard or discourage the State from furnishing all the Supplies in her power, As the existence of the Army and Support of the Cause of America very much depends upon the immediate & vigorous exertions of the several States. Nor ought there to be any responsibility in Congress for the Consequences in Case of a failure. My only Aim by this representation is to give you the Ideas I have upon the Subject, and if possible to induce the State to take Such measures in furnishing the Supplies Call'd for as may reserve to the State or her Delegates in Congress the full and indisputable right, and Power, at any future period when our public affairs will admit of investigating the Subject and endeavouring to obtain a redress of the Grievance and Compensation of the injury Complained of, in such sort that no Act the State may adopt respecting the Subject may by any Construction whatever be deemed an acquiesscence in the System adopted by Congress before alluded to, for furnishing Supplies for the army. It has Incessantly been my most Ardent wish and aim, that Congress would fall upon Some Eligible Mode for freeing the public from the intolerable burden, they have for a long time been groaning and Travelling under even untill now in Supporting Legions of Continental Sinecures who appear in Swarms like Locusts, upon the Land of Egypt, and not only draw Numberless rations; but are in every other respect rioting upon the blood and Treasures of the virtuous Citizens (if any Such there be) in these united States. By making calculations upon indisputable documents in my possession I am with astonishment Convinced that there is not one moment to be lost in retrenching public expenditures-loping off every Exuberance in order to introduce a more oeconomical System. It will be in vain for these States, in future, to attempt Sustaining the burdens She has but too long been Crouching under. And I have good reason to hope some spirited and vigorous measures will immediately be adopted for effecting so desirable an object. Tho' in the present Situation of our public affairs, and the deranged State of our finances the Expenditures must be nominally very large, in order to prosecute the war with Success, or negotiate for peace with any Tolerable degree of policy or advantage. However, the present prospect in my private opinion promises no other alternative than abject Slavery on the one hand, or on the other, to exert every Nerve, to Carry on the War, with redoubled  MARCH 14, 1780  vigour the ensuing Campaign, and I hope No Citizen of these States will hesitate in his Choice a single moment.

8497,dg014567,1780,John Mathews to Horatio Gates,"""John Mathews to Horatio Gates   Dear sir, Philadelphia March 14th. 1780 I received your very obliging and friendly favour yesterday, & embrace this earliest opportunity of acknowledging it. It contains matter of high importance and truly deserving the serious consideration of that body of which I am a member. Your observations instantly flashed conviction on my, before, bewildered senses. They at once evince the experienced soldier, & deep Politician, & I return you, Sir, my most sincere & hearty thanks for them. But alas! either from the obstinacy, or something worse, of the men I have to deal with, I have very little hopes of stimulating them to any acts that will tend to the salvation of those devoted Countries. Were an angel from heaven to perch on the back of the Presidents Chair & proclaim the immediate annihilation of the southern states, unless something vigorous, & effectual was done, & even point out the mode, I sincerely believe, as soon as he had taken his flight, & the surprise had subsided, they would just sink again into the same torpid State in which he found them. As a proof of this, I will beg leave to inform you of what passed yesterday. I received your letter just as I was going to the house. I took the first opportunity after I got there, of informing them, that I had a few hours before received a Letter from a Gentleman for whose opinion I entertained a very high respect, & whose information was to be relyed on. And stated the contents of your letter, as matter of information & not opinion,  MARCH 14, 1780  thinking, by giving it this turn, to attract their serious attention. (1) I thought myself well justifyed in doing so, as your opinion had as much weight in my mind as if you had told me, it was founded on information, you had received from Genl. Clinton. I then took the liberty, by your permission, of proposing the plan of operations for the Southern Campaign, agreeable to your Ideas. I was asked, \""from whom & whence I had my information, & whether I knew this person to be a Whig.\"" I answered I was not at liberty to say from whom, or whence, I had my information, it was enough for them to be told it was undoubted. That the person was as good a Whig as any in that house. They for a little while seemed to be alarmed, & I thought disposed to act like the Guardians of the United States. But as soon as selfishness, and the apprehension of danger to these States, from the adoption of such a plan, had repossessed their minds, every art & contrivance was made use of, to silence the just demands of the Southern States for support, & the business was at last got rid of by the old, stale trick of proposing a Committee to go to Camp to consult with the General. This I rejected with indignation, too well knowing its tendency-that is, merely to save appearances, without the least intention of doing anything.(2) Thus you'll see, my Dr. sir, how little is to be hoped from the best plan that human genius can invent, whilst mens minds are warped by self-interest, & the danger is at a distance. You, Sir, have taken an active, & brilliant part in & know most circumstances relative to this revolution & your abilities enable you to draw just conclusions from what I am going to say. In the beginning of this war, whilst the efforts of the enemy were pointed to the reduction of the Northern States, men were drawn from every State in the Union (except So. Carolina & Georgia, whose local circumstances you well know would not admit of it) for the defence of those States in danger, & some of the people of the Southern States, undertook a march of 1000 miles, & underwent the fatigues of it with cheerfulness to effect so laudable & so desirable a purpose, & those that did not send men contributed their aid of money &c with great good will, & an affectionate zeal, & would have with alacrity done any thing in their power towards the support of the common cause. How the Scene is changed. The war is most evidently transfered from the Northern to the Southern States, & in my opinion their conquest there, are meant to be solid & permanent. Then have not those States, now the theater of war the same right to expect, the support of the United efforts of the other states? Should not the Grand army be now employed there, as it has heretofore been here? It may be said the enemy have still a formidable force at N. York, it's my belief they will be much obliged to us, to let them alone, if so, they will not disturb us, besides are not the troops of Six States sufficient, with the powerful Militia these Countrys afford, to keep the enemy within their lines.(3) Undoubtedly I also could write a Volume on this Subject but I am afraid I have already tried your  patience. Therefore will for the present relieve you, And subscribe myself with much Esteem & regard, Dr. sir, yr. most Obdt. servt. Jno Mathews P.S.

8498,dg014568,1780,John Armstrong Sr to Joseph Reed,"""John Armstrong, Sr., to Joseph Reed   Carlisle 15th March 1780. \""I have at some length lately wrote my Colleagues in Congress on the propriety & necessity of a limitation of prices by Authority, being daily more & more convinced, of the expedience of that measure-and that we have not another, possessed of sufficient energy & requisite dispatch, for the recovery & progress of our affairs-which are too important at this crisis to be risqued on the operation of Slow or doubtful measures-nor have I any doubt but that the law if heartily & any how generally is gone into, will operate & have effect, as beside the requisitions of candid & disinterested men, even those who are much less so, begin to be alarmed at the near approaches of a total stopage of the circulation of the money, & earnestly wish for some certainty respecting it's  MARCH 15, 1780  value, of which at present they have next to none. The topicks of argument in favour of this measure, must often have appeared to your excellency, arising not only from the necessity of the case, from publick & private utillity, but also from the baleful consequences which but too easily present themselves under the want of it. So numerous are the offspring of these different sources of argument, and so plain, that in writing to any wise & good man, I must check the variety of pointing them out, lest I shou'd abuse his time, or tacitly impeach his observation. Nor are political arguments (tho' fully sufficient) the alone Supporters of the doctrine of a general limitation in the present hour, as those of a moral nature also fall into the consideration, altho' we hope there will be no occasion for their publick appearance. All the Objections I have yet seen to a regulating law, appear to be inconclusive-an idle refinement on civil rights & lethargick timidity, make up the best half of them-nor can the past efforts of the Massachusets-bay be thought Sufficient, being without the present pulse of necessity, the sanction of Congress, or the knowledge of concurence in any other State; no wonder then, that their efforts proved abortive. A crafty evasion or elusion of the Law, is the stronghold of it's opposers-to this disease, no doubt corrosives must be applyed-let them do it at the risque of something considerable (but much less so than the safety of their country), perhaps the loss of Ears that refuse to hear, or some quick Sensation to an unfeeling hand. In circumstances like ours, to call the above an Arbitrary Law, is rather a reproach than a Compliment to government, the ultimate design whereof is the Safety and happiness of the whole. There is also a different line of regulation incumbent upon Congress and equally necessary with that which respects the States as mentioned on the other side. The reformation of abuses & retrenchm't of all unnecessary expences is a great & Salutary work, indeed Some observant men of my acquaintance say it ought to be done previous to a limitation of prices, that it wou'd greatly contribute to the effect of that Law, and is the least encouragement the States can have for their trouble in making & vertue in executing it, that after all, their property be not totally embezled thro' want of System and Economy. This is perfectly my own Opinion with this difference, that instead of either of these means taking any remarkable lead of the other in point of time, they ought to run hand in hand, but in the order of things the regulation or limitation of prices as the only basis of every other amendment shou'd first be known, for until some certain value is affixed to the currency, Congress have no rule whereby to fix their Salleries, nor to make any other useful alteration with effect. I have used the name of Congress in this business of reformation, but well know they cannot do it to publick satisfaction; neither is it possible for the Commander in Chief of our Army, and except his advise in some particular cases & information in others, it is a shame to put it  upon him, and what I hope in it's full extent he will not undertake. In short the States or their Executive Councils & they only are competant to this business-and some candid inspectors to make report, or other useful intelligence must at least be had from every County-this is not only essential to the gaining of facts, but by it the people will see that a reformation is intended; for at present chagrin prevails so far, as to excite hard surmises & very disagreeable opinions. The business in question therefore clearly involves two Ideas-the one that it be rightly done, the other that as far as possible the body of the populace have evidence that it is so. By this means confidence in our publick councils may be restored-unanimity & alacrity excited-the best means these, of Securing our future efforts & payment of the publick debt. Congress Ought fully & explicitly to authorize the States in the business above (as I have lately hinted to my Colleagues) and cannot be too early in advising the publick, that they will thoroughly inspect and reform such abuses as have been but too Obvious even to vulgar sight. If any Such resolution as this shou'd be made in Congress, I cou'd wish it dispersed in a number of hand-bills as the News-papers have not a general extent-considering it not only as a mean to animate the hopes of the people, but a good preparative to the limitation of prices by Law, especially if Congress shou'd think proper to express such desire.... You must be puzled at the Alterations & new State-quotas talked of in Congress, of which I had a hint from Mr. Bryan-but no probable progress, nor uniformity of procedure, under any alteration whatever, can I possibly see short of a known or fixed value to our money-at least for some time. It is amazing to see how some otherwise judicious men, will venture to go on, and expect to succeed in the great business of America, without any rational foundation-data, or given point! it is more than any Mathematician on Earth ever pretended to. General Green I hear is a sanguine asserter of the saving efficacy of deep Taxation, that alone is his infallible Nostrem-A deep delusion, a Shameful error. Taxation to the present demands of America is like the Gentlemans Dinner to his appetite, what he had was good, but neither enuff nor half enuff.\"" [P.S.] Some time ago I wrote Mr. McClane,(1) that I cou'd not possibly attend Congress sooner than the begining of May & the prospect of a late Spring but farther confirms that determination-but hope that a Supplement to the Bill, may have passed this last Sessions- not in the addition of Dollars but of Delegates.

Scott, since which time we have not been able to bring on the business of the New Hampshire Grants, although it has been the order of the day for some time past; the attention of MARCH 15, 1780  Congress being almost entirely taken up, in endeavoring to establish their finances and prevent a further depreciation, which in these parts is at the rate of 60 for 1, with respect to specie, and much higher when compared, with the necessaries of life. The plan before the house is generally, to call in all the money in about one year by taxes and destroy it, to be received in taxes at the rate of forty for one in specie. As fast as the old money comes in, new issues in the proportion of 20 for 1, for the purpose of purchasing supplies or other expenditures of the war; each State to appropriate funds for the redemption of the new money, and for the payment of the interest in specie. I expect the plan will be finished this week, and will be immediately sent to the different Legislatures. The enclosed letters, though dated the 2nd of December were not received by the President till the last of last week, which makes some suspect they were antedated;(1) as their delegates declared a few days before that they had no advice from the State respecting the controversy and that they would not put in any claim. There is no doubt but they design if possible to cause delays and had rather the independence of those people should be admitted, than they should be under the jurisdiction of New York. I depend that next week this business will be taken up,(2) and after passing a resolution against the independence of the Grants, a Court will be formed for the hearing of the parties that are ready. 'Tis likely New Hampshire and we can (3) agree on the persons for the Court, which will save much time, although 'tis not likely they can suddenly be convened. As we have so many members from our State here, and the expense of living is so enormous, I think it will be prudent for me to return, which I conclude to do as soon as the travelling will admit, which I trust will meet with your approbation. The Act of Assembly for limiting the boundaries of the State was agreeably received by a great majority of the States and was referred to a special Committee to report thereon;(4) which will be done soon as they find the House have time to receive it.

8504,dg014574,1780,Samuel Holten to John Kettell,"""Samuel Holten to John Kettell   Philadelphia, March 16th, 1780 Dear Mr. Kettell.(1) (Front Street) Before this reaches you, the spring will be opening fast, and as I do not expect to be at home before the last of May, a few lines by way of advice may not be amiss, as I put the greatest dependence upon you in my absence, respecting my Family affairs & little farm. I consider it allmost unnecessary to mention anything to you, respecting how to improve the Land, and I am but poorly acquainted with my own private affairs; while the war continues all the produce of the earth will be in very great demand: and the Seasons in our Country are very uncertain, sometimes cold & wet & at other times hot & dry, so that the ground you plant should be some of it low, & some dry, because mising of a crop at such a time as this wou'd be very distressing, for it might not be to be purchased for love nor money; In the first place, I advise you to Sow with Barley & Flax all the ground you have in hills, because that can be done without dung & the barley will be ripe soon in the year. Then consider how much you can dung & where you can get the dung on easiest & what sort of land it is, whether wet or dry, and put your dung on accordingly, much depends upon the sowing & planting the grain; some Land should be sowed or planted much sooner than an other, always consider whither the ground is warm enough, when you are about sowing or planting, and you should take great care in puting the corn into the ground, so that it may be the most likely to come up. I should suppose you could raise Potatoes, Beans, &c, &c, &c, where you can't well raise corn, no land that is rich should remain unimproved at such a day as this. The next thing is hay; I am sensible if you follow the foregoing advise, you can cut but little English hay. But you must cut all the hay you possibly can of all sorts, the meanest will make dung & the dung will make corn, and you must carefully MARCH 16. 1780  save all the straw, stalks & husks for this will keep cows, don't forgit to sow plenty of turnip seed, among the Flax and corn. You will take care to keep the Cattle below untill the feed is good above, and then the lower Swamp must be moved late. Wool is of great value, & I hope you keep much the same number of sheep as when I left home. There is danger of the corns being greatly destroyed by birds & otherways about the time it comes up; please let me know how your hay holds out, this tedious winter. The first business upon a farm in the Spring is the beating the dung to pieces in the Field & pasture, if you have time. Congress have appointed the last Wednesday in April next, as a day of Fasting, humiliation & prayer throughout the States. Give my kindest love to Mrs. Kettell & your little son; and also to Polly & Sally, when you see them. Yours affectionately, S. Holten. P.S. I inclose you a paper which contains the weight of a very large Cow, lately killed in this city; I have often seen her, & have eat some of the beef. ""

There are throughout that anonymous letter so many strong marks of malice & revenge that I am confident the author had something more in view than giving information from a regard to the public good; and I have no doubt that He is some disappointed Officer, or some one who wishes to become a member of the Navy board. Of this opinion I find the marine committee were when they first received it, and in that light it is viewed by the Admiralty board to whom I read your letter which respected it. If I could think of any method by pursuing of which there would be probability of investigating the Assassin, I would persue it with ardour, and give up to you the villain when detected; but it appears to me idle to attempt to discover any thing without some clue. A man who means to stab in the dark will involve himself in such obscurity as not to leave one single ray of light by which he may [be] found. The miscreants who too frequently knock down and rob people in the streets of this city chuse the darkest nights to  MARCH 17, 1780  perpetrate their hellish purposes in, and I do not recollect that one of them has yet been taken, but I presume they will proceed until embolden'd by their crimes they become less thoughtful of their security, and so expose themselves to detection. In like manner the vile Assassin of the reputation of the eastern Navy board, finding that his attempt hath not succeded, and imagining that he is not watched by them, may prompted on by malice or envy make other attempts until he shall be discover'd. I think that the best way is to let him go on digging his own Pit. I am sorry that my letter to Mr. Schweighauser (2) did not arrive seasonably for the packet which sailed in January. I hope it will go in the Active. The badness of the roads & the dilatoriness of the Posts have made any distant communications very slow indeed. Your letters of the 22d of January and the 10th of February were a long time coming. The roads will soon grow better and I hope the warmth of Spring will make the riders more active. The Bugbear expedition as you call it I am afraid will turn out to be something very serious. Part of the fleet have arrived of[f] Georgia and there is no doubt but that Charlestown is their object. I wish we may be able to hold it. It is said that the naval force there is sufficient to guard the passage to it by water. I wish it may prove so and that the force by land may be sufficient to defend it on the land side but I confess I am not without my fears. There is no prospect of peace at present. What this campaign may produce I dont know, that altogether depends upon the good or ill success of our Arms and that of our allies. Our depretiating currency is at present our worst enemy.

8517,dg014587,1780,Connecticut Delegates to Jonathan Trumbull Sr,"""Connecticut Delegates to Jonathan Trumbull, Sr.   Sir Philadelphia March 20th, 1780 The President will transmit to your Excellency the resolutions of Congress for Sinking the continental Bills of Credit and issuing New Bills on the credit of the Several States,(1) which We hope will be approved by your Excellency & the Honorable the General Assembly. It was judged impracticable to carry on the war another year with the present currency-and no other plan has been proposed that appeared So likely to relieve us from the Embarrassments of a fluctuating currency as that which has been adopted by Congress. The depreciation here has been at the rate of Sixty for one and in the Southern States from forty to fifty. Neither the Scarcity or the Collection of taxes have had any effect to appreciate, or fix, its value. 'Tis apprehended that the New Bills will be effectually Secured against depreciation, from the Smallness of the quantity to be in Circulation, the funds provided for their redemption, the Shortness of the period, and the payment of an annual Interest. The preparing them under the direction of the Board of Treasury, and the insurance of payment by the United States in case any State Shall by the events of the war be rendered incapable of redeeming them, will give them a currency through out the United States, and be a Security against Counterfeits. This emission of Bills will not only introduce a Stable Medium of Trade-but increase the revenue, The amount of five millions of dollars equal to Specie. The Six tenths of the Bills to be emitted will enable the States to purchase the Specific Supplies called for by the resolution of the 25th of February last, and the remaining four tenths will Supply the continental Treasury for Paying the Army &ca, while the States are collecting in the old Bills by taxes. And although it is recommended to collect in the Continental Bills by Monthly Assessments it may be expedient to give the people an opportunity of paying the whole at one payment. It may also be expedient for the States to allow New Bills to be exchanged for the MARCH 20, 1780  old, that the old may be drawn out of circulation as Soon as possible to prevent further imposition by counterfeits and if there Should be a Scarcity of money people might be allowed to pay their rates in provisions to be delivered at the magazines at the prices fixed by Congress. The New Bills will be prepared and forwarded to the States as Soon As possible. We hear that the Honorable Assembly have ordered a New Emission of Bills.(2) We beg leave to Submit to Your Excellency whether it will not be expedient to Stop the issuing of them, and immediately adopt the plan recommended by Congress. We Should be Sorry to have that fail of the good effects expected from it by any Act or omission on the part of the States. The Same proportions are kept up in the present requisitions as in the resolution of the 7th of October last, Wherein Connecticut is rated much too high, but hope that wont prevent her compliance at least to the amount of her quota, which would be about one twelfth part, in case none of the States were disabled by the events of the war from raising their quotas. Perhaps her quota in present circumstances, would be more than one eleventh part of the whole-repeated Assurances have been given by Congress that those States which do more than their proportion Shall be equitably compensated. There is a report before Congress for fixing the rate in Specie at which the loan office certificates Shall be paid.(3) It is expected that a new regulation of the Quarter Master's and other Staff departments will Soon be established on the most Economical plans whereby much expence will be Saved. They will be Accommodated to the late regulation of making the purchases by the States. The prices of the Specific Articles to be furnished by the States were estimated at about 50 per cent above the prices in 1774. They include all expences of purchasing and delivering them into the Magazines. The motives for Adopting that measure were, the rendering the Supplies more certain and equable among the States, and to prevent frauds & abuses. And the aid of the States in procuring Supplies was found to be absolutely necessary. By a Letter from General Lincoln of the 22d Ultimo we are informed that part of the British forces that left New York were Landed on St Johns, & James's Islands, near Charles town the Numbers not Assertained, but he thinks there is a good prospect of making a Successful opposition to them.(4) Mr. Lawrence expected to Sail for Europe the 26th of Feby.

The extreme badness of the roads and frequency of rains rendered my journey so slow that I did not reach this place till Saturday last.(1) The only public intelligence I have to communicate is that the great and progressive depreciation of the paper currency had introduced such disorder and perplexity into public affairs for the present and threatened to load the United States with such an intolerable burden of debt, that Congress have thought it expedient to convert the 200,000,000 of Dollars now in circulation into a real debt of 5,000,000 by establishing the exchange at 40 for 1. And taxes for calling it in during the ensuing year, are to be payable at the option of the people in specie or paper according to that difference. In order to carry on public measures in future money is to be emitted under the combined faith of Congress and the several States, secured on permanent and specific funds to be provided by the latter. This scheme was finally resolved on on Saturday last.(2) It has not yet been printed but will be immediately. I shall transmit a copy to you by the first opportunity. The little time I have been here makes it impossible for me to enter into a particular delineation of it. It will probably create great proplexity and complaints in many private transactions. Congress have recommended to the States to repeal their tender laws, and to take measures for preventing injustice as much as possible. It is probable that in the case of loans to the public, the state of depreciation at the time they were made will be the rule of payment, but nothing is yet decided on that point. I expect to be more at leisure to write fully by next post. Yrs. &c. &c. James Madison Junr. ""

8527,dg014597,1780,New York Delegates to George Clinton,"""New York Delegates to George Clinton   Sir, Philadelphia, March 21. 1780. (1) We do ourselves the honor to refer your Excellency to some important resolutions which passed Congress on Saturday, and will be transmitted to you by the President;(2) whether their effect will be such as we wish, time alone can discover. Our hopes are sanguine; as the minutes of Congress will shew that we unanimously concurred in them, we think it proper to lay before your Excellency our reasons, not only as a justification of our conduct to our constituents, if contrary to our expectations the measure should not meet with their approbation, but in order to explain more fully the principles upon which the determinations of Congress were formed. The continued and rapid depreciation, notwithstanding the pressure of taxes, which was severely felt in many places; the increased demands of the Army, in consequence of that depreciation; the exhausted state of the public treasury; the utter impossibility of procuring a supply in any other way, adequate to the demand by taxation, even if the people could have submitted to have their burthens doubled upon them, called aloud for some firm and decided alteration in our system of finance. In vain we endeavored to borrow in aid of the taxes, the monied interest availing themselves of our necessities refusing to lend, though we offered them near fifty per cent advance on sterling bills. This evil increased upon us every day, and loans become more difficult when the depreciated state of the currency reduced the relative quantity below what was necessary as a medium of commerce, in which situation of things no person would lend unless upon such a premium as would be sufficient to indemnify him for the capital drawn from trade; and even then only slowly, and in Small quantities, as the necessities of the public daily giving him hopes for more advantageous terms. In this situation nothing was left us but some firm and decided measure, or public bankruptcy and ruin. We flatter ourselves the part we have taken will do justice to individuals as far as it can be done with safety, and enable the public to make those exertions on which the happiness of its members depend. The farmer will acknowledge the propriety of a measure which compels him to pay to the public no more than the value of what has been received to his use, and the money holder if he reasons justly, will be satisfied with the MARCH 21, 1780  real worth of the commodity with which he purchased that money, instead of a visionary wealth which every hour diminishes in his hands, and which must have vanished into air, as the cause on which it was borne could no longer be supported. The continuation of the tax to the amount required, though desirable and to be complied with if possible, must however be limited by the situation of every State. Perhaps with us it may be advisable after the establishment of funds, to take in part of the old by exchange for the new emissions in order to lighten the tax; perhaps too it might be advantageously funded upon our confiscated estates and back lands. The resolution to receive specie and the new bills at 40 times the nominal value of the bills of credit now in circulation is founded upon a belief that that is about the average value at which it was received by the present possessors of them: this may indeed bear hard upon individuals, but in so great a work it cannot but be, that private interests must yield to public utility. It may be asked, what will secure the new emissions from depreciation? We answer, first the reduction of the whole debt to so moderate a compass as to render the payment of it easy; second, the funds on which they are to be issued, which it is expected will be sufficient to convince the creditor of the public that his money rests on a firm basis. These are the only securities a community can give, and these have always been sufficient, if a State did not either outrun its resources, or neglect to apply them to the maintenance of public credit. We flatter ourselves the State will see the necessity of such established system of taxation as will enable the public creditor to calculate the value of his security, without which a paper credit must always fluctuate. Besides the advantages which we have already stated as the probable consequences of this measure, and those more obvious benefits that arise from throwing off an unjust and cumbrous load of debt which threatened for ages to clog the industry of our people. From having some fixed standard by which to ascertain the pay of our officers, civil and military-from checking the idleness and dissipation which a fluctuating medium always occasions, and from banishing their baneful spirit of jobbing and speculation-which disordered Finances and a heavy public debt never fail to give birth to. We had reasons arising from the peculiar situation of our State which attached us to the measure. We had little room to hope that Congress would make us those allowances in the liquidation of the public debt, which as we conceived, our distresses entitled us to; since, though they acknowledged the weight of our present burthens, yet they seemed to Suppose (and perhaps with some degree of justice) that our future resources were fully sufficient to enable us to bear any proportion of the debt, which by the terms of the confederation could be imposed on us. Had they therefore under this impression adopted any system of appreciation for which taxation was the basis, our State would have been unable to tax in proportion to its   neighbors, would necessarily have fallen a sacrifice to that appreciation. From this evil we are now happily secured, since whatever time our necessities may oblige us to take for the redemption of the public debt, we are assured that the value of money cannot increase to our ruin. We have dwelt thus long upon this subject, because we are sensible that a measure in which numbers are interested must have many difficulties to struggle with, and impressed with its necessity and importance, we wish to bespeak for it the support and patronage of the State. The business of the Grants still drags on heavily; at present we are prevented from proceeding by the sickness of one of the representatives from Maryland, whose absence breaks up the Congress,(3) if agreeable to the spirit of the resolutions of Sept'r last, the States that are interested in the controversy should stand aside. We shall omit no opportunity of bringing it on, when a convenient season offers. We have the honor to be with the highest respect and esteem, your Excellency's most obt. humble Servts. Jno.

The sinews of war must be braced, and more regular and more ample supplies bro't into the Treasury than it hath received for months past or our military preparations must cease and the most pernicious consequences ensue. MARCH 21, 1780  Congress have long seen with alarming apprehensions the crisis to which a continued depretiation of our paper currency would one day reduce our affairs. They have given frequent and faithful warnings to the several States; and have exerted every power on their part to avert the impending mischief; but to little or no purpose. The evil, like an uncontrouled torrent hath advanced on with rapid progress, and now threatens to overwhelm us. Under these circumstances Congress have thought it necessary to adopt a new plan of finance; and have accordingly come to the decisive resolutions which we now have the honour to inclose to you.(3) The main objects of them you will readily perceive are; by one operation to give an establishment to the paper medium, to realize the nominal debt of the United States, and find supplies for the treasury. We have taken the liberty to point out very briefly the objects of the Plan referred to and the necessity which compelled Congress to adopt it. We will only subjoin that if it should meet the approbation of our legislature, we hope that they will immediately make the necessary provisions for carrying it into effectual execution. In a letter lately written by Mr Ellery to the Lieut. Governor (4) he mentioned the substance of a letter received not long since from Dr. Franklin, and also transmitted the translation of a letter from the King of France to Congress; and at the same time desired his Honour to communicate them to your Excellency and the Genl. Assembly, with an apology for our not writing to Government. Since that we have received no intelligence from Europe or any other quarter. We are in daily expectation of hearing something from the Southward. We have received no advices from thence later than the very beginning of February, and they only announced the arrival of part of the British fleet off Georgia, without particularizing their number or the number of troops aboard. Indeed it could not be ascertained. Inclosed is a resolution of Congress of the 29th of February last,(5) which may be of use in the settlement with the continental Officers & Soldiers of our State. Congress have passed resolutions recommending a revision of their tender Laws &c. of which we will also transmit a copy if one can be procured before the post goes out.(6) Since writing the foregoing Congress have received a letter from Genl. Lincoln of the 22d of February.(7) In which he observes \""The uncertain events of war will not authorize an assurance of success; but I think if my requisition of 2000 militia from the country is complied with, and General Hogan with our other expected succours, arrive time we may flatter ourselves with the probability of an effectual opposition.\"" The intelligence in the paper respecting the Enemy &c at the Southward is good, and renders it unnecessary to copy  MARCH 22, 1780  anymore of Genl. Lincoln's Letter. We are [with] the greatest respect, Yr Excellency's most obedt. Servts William Ellery John Collins ""

But, Sir, there have been many and urgent calls for money which it has been impossible for Congress with a nearly exhausted treasury to comply with; and the same difficulties will remain so long as the several States are dilatory in collecting their quotas of money, or when collected apply it to other purposes than the payment of Continental warrants. The reduction of the Battalions in the continental army, is a matter now before Congress, but is attended with difficulties. Tho' ceconomy pleads strongly in favour of the measure, yet it is doubtful .whether there will be sufficient time to adjust and settle an intire new arangement of the Army before they may be called to take the field; and as every new arrangement is also found to be a new source of discontent, it is the opinion of some to postpone this reduction until there shall be fewer other causes of discontent in the army than at present. It has also been observed that should the Battalions not be reduced at this juncture, yet considerable savings may be made, by the several States forbareing to fill up vacanies in their respective lines, which are already numerous should they not become more so. Our endeavours however shall not be wanting to carry our instructions upon this head into effect. It is with pleasure we observe from the acts transmitted to us, that on the great and embarrased subject of the publick finances the leading sentiments of the assembly of Connecticut are much the same as on full discussion have been assented to in Congress. And we entertain the more confidence from this consideration that the measures which Congress after so much deliberation have recommended will meet that concurrence and support from all the legislatures of these United States as is essential to attaining the ends therein proposed. Congress have judged it expedient to continue Jesse Brown an Express rider until their late establishment of posts shall have taken its effect and their further orders shall be given.(2) By a Delegate from South Carolina just arived (3) we learn that Charlestown was safe on the 1t Instant-that the enemy who had occupied the adjacent Islands had appeared for some days motionless-that the Garrison were in good spirits-that the North Caro- MARCH 23, 1780  lina Brigade of Continental troops had arived-& that the Virginia line were met on their march tho' at the unexpected distance of four hundred miles.(4) We have the honor to be, with the highest respect, your Excellency's most obedt. humbl.

Your Excellency must have long seen with alarming apprehensions the crisis to which a continued depreciation of the paper currency would one day reduce our affairs. It is now, Sir, just at hand. Without more stability in the medium & far more ample supplies in the treasury than for months past, it will be impossible for our military preperations to proceed, & the Army must disband. The present moment is indeed critical, & if let slip the confusion & distress will be infinite. This, Sir, is percisely the point of time for the several Legislatures to act decidedly & in a manner that the world will forever call wise. It is now in their power by a single operation to give a sure establishment for publick credit, to realize the publick debt at its just value, &, without adding to the burdens of the people, to supply the treasury. To furnish one common ground to unite their exertions upon for the accomplishment of these great purposes, your Excellency will easily percieve to be the spirit & design of the resolutions above referred to. They speak a language too plain to need any comment. I will only add concerning them that they have been the product of much labor & discussion; and tho' some States may have reason for thinking they are not the best possible, yet they are the best Congress could agree upon; and should they be rejected I confess I do not well see on what ground the common exertions of the several States are to be united and continued hereafter. Your Excellency will forgive me the very great freedom of this Letter, and permit me the honor of subscribing myself, with the highest Respect, your Excellencys most obedt. humbl Servt, Olivr.

He says the British troops were in the same position as on the 25 of February (as your Excy. has already been informed) Genl. Hogan had arrived with the No. Carolina Brigade. Genl. Woodford on the 11 Inst. was 380 miles distant from Chs. Town. Genl. Scott, had at last proceeded for that place alone. The troops that were under his Command remained at Petersburg without the least appearance of moving. The lines of Chs. Town were compleated & the harbour well secured by a respectable Naval armament, & wanted nothing to render it almost impregnable, but a larger body of men, than they then had, or had any prospect of soon obtaining, for its defence. It was the general opinion when he came away, that the enemy had met with material losses at Sea, either in men, or some of their capital Store ships, which caused their inactivity, as they had been possessed of the principal part of the ground they then occupied for twenty one days. Genl. Lincoln commanded in Chs. Town & Genl. Moultrie at a post 24 miles from the town (Bacon's bridge, an important pass on Ashley river) with a body of between 400 & 500 horse, & a few Infantry. The inactivity of the enemy in So. Carolina, the arrival of the Roebuck, with the transports from thence, at New York, seems to countenance the opinion, of the enemy's being unprepared for an attack, & which may probably not take place before the return of those Ships from N. York. In this event it will give time for the Virginia troops to get up, which will be a most fortunate circumstance. I thought it advisable to give Your Excy. this information as it may lead to your obtaining some usefull intelligence from a certain quarter.

8542,dg014612,1780,Thomas McKean to Richard Henry Lee,"""Thomas McKean to Richard Henry Lee   Dear Sir, Philadelphia, March 25th. 1780. Your esteemed favor of the 15th last month, with the extracts from your much injured brother's letter to the President of Congress, and the copy of Doctor Berkenhout's letter to yourself, inclosed, came safe to hand. (1) Next to the approbation of my own conscience, it has always been my wish to obtain that of the wise & good, and I confess I am happy in having yours. I flatter myself the time will shortly come, when the honest laborers in the cause of freedom & their country will at least meet with the reward of being known, and when also the double-dealing artful pretenders will be discovered. There has been a virtuous band in Congress from the beginning of the present contest, but they were never so few, or so much opposed as just after you and your good brother left us. In the Winter & Spring of 1779 there was a cabal, whose views I could not fathom; there were some possessed of restless spirits, and who endeavored to set member against member, and the Congress against the States, particularly Pennsylvania and those of New-England, and the States agt. Congress. Every artifice was used to instill prejudices against all our foreign Ministers and Commissioners, particularly your brothers; and I really believe, if I had not in April last gone off the Bench into Congress, in the face of a vote of the Assembly of Pennsylvania, that they would have been recalled without exception. My fears were, that at that critical period, when it had been propagated in Europe; and some uneasiness discovered on that score by the court of France that we were listening to overtures from Great Britain, a change of men might have implied a change of measures, and given some countenance to the reports; and for this reason I thought it wrong to recal any Gentleman in such a conjuncture. The vote was taken with respect to Doctor Franklin, and being determined in the negative, it was postponed as to the rest until I was absent on the circuit.(2) Places were sought after by some, and vacancies were necessary for the purpose of obtaining them, but I could not think this was the only thing in contemplation; tho' I may have been mistaken, as harmony seemed to be restored in some measure upon the appointments of Messrs. Jay and Carmichael. The death of Mr. Drayton, and the considerable change about that time of the members, several of them not having been re-elected, left us pretty quiet ever since, tho' prejudices still too much prevail. When I reflect on the assiduity, the zeal, the fidelity, the abilities and patriotism of Doctor A. Lee, I cannot help deploring his fate, and reprobating the ingratitude of Congress; but, Sir, it is with pleasure I can assure you that he has many unshaken friends still remaining in that Body, who have never seen him, and who esteem him only for his public virtues. I profess myself one of these, and he MARCH 25, 1780  has at least my warmest thanks for his substantial services rendered to my country. I cannot think it any reflection on a Gentleman's heart, that he has been mistaken in entertaining too good an opinion of another, nor am I at all surprized that even you should have been led into an error with respect to Doctor Berkenhout after perusing his letter and knowing his insinuating address: but I shall say no more on this head, as I am really appologizing for myself. The deranged state of our finances has given us infinite trouble and concern; A new plan has been adopted, which is published in the News-Papers, to which I shall refer you-if it can be carried into execution it will be a great relief to us; and I see nothing else left but for every Whig to exert himself in its support. There is no great prospect of peace, tho' the late intelligence from Europe is otherwise favorable. I suspect, that Mr. Temple (who came over in 1778 with Doctor Berkenhout) will shortly venture here again with propositions (perhaps secret) to acknowledge the Independence of the States, except South Carolina & Georgia, and that part of Massachusetts, formerly called the Province of Main, on condition of our neutrality between Britain & Spain-he is to have power to draw on two merchants in London of his own nomination ad libitum.(3) This is not mere conjecture or report; but it may not be attempted to be carried into execution, as I think, upon the least reflection he must despair of success. Can they suppose that these States will be so perfidious to one another, or to the auxiliary of the Ally-that they are so corrupt-so base? Can they be taught to believe, that a virtuous people can grow so extremely wicked by a war of five years continuance?

From the best intelligence from that quarter there seems to be great encouragement to hope that Clintons operations will be again frustrated. Our great apprehensions at present flow from a very different quarter. Among the various conjunctures of alarm and distress which have arisen in the course of the revolution, it is with pain I affirm to you Sir, no one can be singled out more truly critical than the present. Our army threatened with an immediate alternative of disbanding or living on free quarter, the public treasury empty, public credit exhausted, nay the private credit of purchasing Agents employed I am told as far as it will bear, Congress complaining of the extortion of the people, the people of the improvidence of Congress, and the army of both. Our affairs requiring the most mature & systematic measures, and the urgency of occasions admitting only of temporary expedients and those expedients generating new difficulties. Congress from a defect of adequate Statesmen more likely to fall into wrong measures and of less weight to enforce right ones, recommending plans to the several states for execution and the states separately rejudging the expediency of such plans, whereby the same distrust of concurrent exertions that has damped the ardor of patriotic individuals must produce the same effect among the States themselves. An old System of finance discarded as incompetent to our necessities, an untried & precarious one substituted and a total stagnation in prospect between the end of the former & the operation of the latter. These are the outlines of the true picture of our public situation. I leave it to your own imagination to fill them up. Believe me Sir as things now stand if the States do not vigorously proceed in collecting the old money and establishing [funds?] for the credit of the new, that we are undone; and let them be ever so expeditious in doing this still the intermediate distress to our army and hindrance to public affairs are a subject of melancholy reflection. Genl Washington writes that a failure of bread has already commenced in the army; and that for any thing he sees it must unavoidably increase.(2) Meat they have only for a short season and as the whole dependance is on provisions now to be procured; without a shilling for the purpose, and without credit for a shilling, I look forward with the most pungent apprehensions. It will be attempted I believe to purchase a few supplies with loan office Certificates, but whether they will be received is perhaps far from being certain, and if received will certainly be a most expensive & ruinous expedient. It is not without some reluc- MARCH 27, 1780  tance I trust this information to a conveyance by post, but I know of no better at present, and I conceive it to be absolutely necessary to be known to those who are most able and zealous to contribute to the public relief. March 28. Authentic information is now recd. that the Enemy in their passage to Georgia lost all their Horse,(3) the Defiance of 64 guns which foundered at sea, three transports with troops, although it is pretended these troops and the men of the Defiance were saved, and 1 transport with Hessians of which nothing has been heard. By a letter from Mr. Adams dated Corunna 16 Decr. there seems little probability that Britain is yet in a humour for peace.(4) The Russian Ambassador at that Court has been lately changed, and the new one on his way to London made some stop at Paris whence a rumor has spread in Europe that Russia was about to employ her mediation for peace. Should there be any reality in it, Mr. Adams says it is the opinion of the most intelligent he had conversed with that the independance of the United [States] would be insisted on as a preliminary: to which G.B. would accede with much greater repugnance than the cession of Gibraltar which Spain was determined to make a sine qua non. With respect and regard I am, Dr Sir, yrs. sincerly James Madison Jr ""

8544,dg014614,1780,Oliver Ellsworth to Jonathan Trumbull Sr,"""Oliver Ellsworth to Jonathan Trumbull, Sr.   Sir, Philadelphia, March 28. 1780. It has been much expected in Europe that Russia would offer herself as a mediator betwen the belligerent powers there. Good authority now assures us, that if she does one of the ultimata that she will insist on is that America remain independant and that she also wishes Gibralter to be ceeded to Spain. She has lately changed her minister at the court of London. The new one on his way was three weeks at Paris. Letters are received from Mr. Adams in Spain the 11th & 16th of Decr. He acknowledges politeness and civilities greater  MARCH 28, 1780  than has been usually shewn to strangers in that Kingdom, and found also that orders had been issued from the King for his subjects to treat all Americans as their dear friends. Mr. Adams was proceeding on his way to France by land. His travels it is to be hoped will not only be attended with information to himself but with utility also to the publick. Advice is had from General Clintons Headquarters as late as the 4th Instant that his principal force was then on James's Island and was preparing to possess Stono Ferry-that the Defiance a 64 gun Ship foundered at Sea on their passage from New York as did also three transports, the men it is given out were saved-that one Transport with Hessian Troops there had been no account of-that all their Cavalry were lost and other damages sustained. Less pleasing but not less necessary to be known is the information I will further take the liberty [to] add. It is that the continental treasury is now empty. This has been nearly the case for some weeks. The consequence is that the continental agents have not only discontinued their purchases, but cannot move forward the little supplies they have on hand; and the army are again in want. Nor does it yet appear when either the army or Treasury will be supplied by the several States. Surely, Sir, they do not expect the war to be carried on without means, nor can they mean to let it drop here. Does it not then behove them to adopt effectual measures for drawing forth their resources, and that without a moments delay? Can it, Sir, be the design of Heaven, that has roused us to exertions thus far, and armed mighty nations for our support and brought us within sight of the promised rest to leave us after all to destruction, and to lament also the best blood of our land as spilt in vain? I trust not. Mr. Sherman will leave Congress in a few days and as he will be present with the general assembly when they meet he will be able more fully than a letter can do to give the necessary information of the State of our publick affairs. I hope his place in Congress will be soon supplied & mine also. For further news of the day I beg leave to refer your Excellency to the enclosed papers.

8558,dg0151,1780,Elbridge Gerry to Samuel Huntington,"""Elbridge Gerry to Samuel Huntington
 April 3, 1780  Sir, Philadelphia 3d April 1780 I was honored on the 2nd of February last, with your Letter inclosing a Resolution of Congress of the same Date; & having since been frequently informed by Members of the House, that there was a general Disposition therein, to consider with Candor my Letter of the l9th Feby last, I have patiently waited more than a Month for an Answer to the same.(1) I have also omitted to communicate the Affair to the State which I have the Honor to represent, lest their Harmony with Congress might be interrupted at a Time when the publick Interest renders it necessary, that every State should support them. But seeing no longer a Prospect of being restored to the privilege of a Member, or even of having my Claim to it considered, painful as it is to contend with a Body of which I have long been a Member, or to adopt any Measures which may appear inconsistent with an ardent Desire to promote their Dignity & Honor, I am nevertheless constrained by a Sense of Duty to my Country and Constituents, to enter into a full & free Discussion of this Subject, & to close it with Congress.  The Decision of Congress \""that I was not in order in requiring the Yeas & Nays on a Question of Order\"" was, as I conceive, clearly against the Rules & Usage of the House, referred to in the Letter last mentioned.(2) Congress have undoubtedly a Right to alter these whenever they think it expedient, but they will give me Leave to deny their Authority, for determining that a Member is out of order, when he conducts agreably to both. Had Congress at that Time thot it necessary, & actually passed a Resolution to discontinue the Yeas & Nays on questions of order, still it is difficult to conceive, that as impartial Judges, they could determine a Member to have been out of order, for using that privilege previous to the passing of such a Resolve.  If that Decission was intended as an Act for discontinuing this privilege, it may be necessary to enquire, how the States are to be informed of the Conduct of their respective Members in Congress? or, by what Means the Fountain of the Confederacy is to be kept pure, & Members supported in the faithful Discharge of their Trust? Perhaps it will be said, that the privilege of requiring the Yeas & Nays is still continued, excepting on questions of Order, & is sufficient for the purposes mentioned. But the Answer to this is plain, that the Conduct of Members may thus appear on all propositions decided by Congress; but will be concealed on all Motions by them suppressed, which is the particular Greivance now complained of under such Circumstances, if a Member makes a Motion, & a Majority are disposed to be arbitrary, they may call him to order, & silence him, APRIL 3, 1780  whilst strictly conforming to the Rules & Usage of the House-they may thus prevent propositions, however useful & necessary, from being considered by Congress-they may for partial or private purposes, devise & pass plausible Resolutions, & refuse to consider Motions for detecting the fallacy of, or for amending them-they may continue to debar particular Members from the Use of their privileges, &, by preventing Entries on the Journals, may conceal from the States, the Conduct of themselves, & others, in the premisses. Whereas, by continuing the Yeas & Nays on questions of order, every Member may have an Oppertunity to check or expose such arbitrary proceedings; & the Stigma will rest on those who adopt them. But what is the Sense of Congress & of the several States on the Subject in the Articles of Confederation? Therein it is expressly provided, \""that the Yeas & Nays of the Delegates of each State on any question, shall be entered on the Journals, when it is desired by any Delegate;\"" from whence it is evident, that no Member can be deprived of the privilege of having the Yeas & Nays on a question of order, when the Articles of the Confederacy are fully ratified, without a direct Violation thereof.  If on the other Hand, the Decision was not intended to discontinue this privilege, I am no longer at a Loss for the Reasons of its not being entered on the Journals; because it would thus become a general Rule, & equally affect the several Members but the proceedings of Congress on this occasion, will still appear extraordinary; for they have not only adjudged a Member to be out of order, whilst strictly conforming to the Rules & Usage of the House, but leaving these unaltered, which establish the contested privilege, they have in Effect determined that Congress have a Right to support some, & restrain other Members in the Use of the same privilege, & have thus impaired that equal Representation in Congress, which is considered by the States so essential to their Liberties.  With Respect to the Resolution of Congress of the 22d of Feby last, relative to the Mode of hearing a Member who thinks himself aggreived, It may suffice to shew, that it does not apply to the present Case. The Resolve is as follows \""That any Member thinking his privilege infringed by anything said or done in the House, ought of Right to be heard in his Place.\"" It appears by the Journals of that Date, that the Words \""& not otherwise\"" were moved as part of the original Proposition,(3) & rejected by a Division of the House; by What Rule of Construction then does the Resolve determine, that a Member shall not \""be heard\"" unless \""in his Place\""? But should even this be admitted, yet it is presumed, that Congress did not mean to subject a Member to an ex post Facto Act, which under the Appearance of regulating the Mode of supporting his Claim, materially affects the Claim itself. When an essential privilege of a Member is infringed by Congress, & he cannot obtain Redress, it becomes his Duty to appeal to his Constituents; and how is he to make his Conduct appear, if in  APRIL 14,1780  defending his privilege he is confined to the Mode prescribed by the Resolve? Should he propose in his place any Entry to be made on the Journals, Congress may prevent it; & if he is unguarded in his Expressions to the House, they may order the same to be recorded, whilst those of other Members to him, however exceptionable, may pass unnoticed. An Instance of this happened at York Town, & may occur to the Memory of a Gentleman now in Congress,(4) who will do me the Justice to acknowledge, that with him I then opposed such ungenerous proceeding;(5) but if his Opinion is altered, as it Appears to be on this occasion, he has undoubtedly a precedent to support it. Indeed had the Resolve applyed, what it proposes has been done in the present affair, & without Effect: for it is well known, that the Member in his place, repeatedly required the Yeas & Nays on the Question of order, that when the Right was disputed, he produced in its Defence, the Rules & Usage of the House; & that he considered the Decision, as having the Appearance of an arbitrary proceeding. It is evident by the Journals, that when the Resolve was under Consideration, a paragraph for taking the Sense of Congress on Matters of privilege \""in preference to any other Business\"" was expunged from the original proposition, by a Vote of the House: this, together with the Resolve itself, which involves a plain question of privilege in Disputes about the Mode of claiming it, has eventually been the Cause of deferring an Answer to my Requisition of the l9th of February, untill Gentlemen have had an Oppertunity of carrying thro' their favorite plan, then under Consideration. And if it was the Intention of Congress, by that Vote to negative the paragraph, a Majority of the House may at any Time avoid the Opposition of a Member, by depriving him of his privilege & obliging him to submit to the Greivance, or withdraw from the House during their Pleasure. Upon the Whole, sir, Is it not evident from undeniable Facts, that a Member of the House has been thus compelled to an explicit Remonstrance against their proceedings? that he has contended merely for the essential privilege of manifesting his Conduct in Congress. that he is justly responsible for his own, but not for another's Conduct, that in claiming his privilege, he has neither received that Support nor Attention, which as a Member he had a Right to expect? & that he is under the disagreable Necessity of submitting to a dangerous Attack, made thro him, on the Liberties of the House, or of referring the Matter to his Constituents? These are Considerations which, however veiw'd by the House, are weighty in his Mind, & have made it his Duty to adopt the alternative, whilst he thinks himself deprived of his Seat in Congress. I have the Honor to be sir, with the highest Respect, your most obedient, & most humble Servt.  E. Gerry ""

  Sir, Philadelphia April 4th. 1780. I received your excellency's favour of the 8th of March and advert to the contents of it.(1) You are pleased to inform me that the Genl. Assembly, at their Session held on the fourth Monday of February, passed a resolve to raise 810 men including those already raised in Col Green's and Col. Angels regiments. You then mention the proposed bounty &c and proceed to say \""That when you consider there is one half of the above number of men now to be raised there being about one half of them now in Cols. Green's & Angel's regiments\"" &c &c. Your Excellency must have attended to the words of the resolution of Congress immediately following the adjustment of the Quotas to wit, \""That all the men whose times of service do not expire before the last day of Sepr. next, be counted towards the quotas of the States to which they respectively belong, whether they compose the battalions in the lines of the several States, those of the additional corps, including the guards, the artillery and horse or the regimental artificers in the departments of the quarter master general and commissary general of military Stores who being credited to the states respectively should be provided for, deemed and treated in the same manner with the men in the several state lines\"" &c &c.(2) Now, Sir, if we have any men, belonging to our State, in Col Sherburn's regiment in the guards &c &c whose times do not expire by the last day of next Sept, and I imagin we have, they must be counted towards our quota, and of consequence included in the number of our men as well as those in Green's & Angel's regiments; and therefore, if the supposition I have made proves true we shall not have one half of our quota to raise, if about one half of it is now in Greenes & Angels regiments. I have been the more particular because I should be very sorry to have a State whose quota is disproportioned to its abilities, attempt to do more than is required of it. Sensible that our quota was too large I  APRIL 4, 1780  moved and urged that it might be reduced to 700; but could not get Congress to agree to it. When the Arrangement was made at York Town,(3) One regiment only was assigned to us; and perhaps if we had not been so forward to raise a regiment of blacks, without the request or even the knowledge of Congress, one regiment only would now have been required. Our State hath sometimes by too great an ardour injured itself. When the account hinted at comes forward I shall exert myself to have it paid, and shall take notice of the bounties we have proposed to pay, & make use of every other argument to accomplish the wishes of the State Which my invention can suggest.  Your Excellency requests, if I should find it necessary that I would write to Genl. Washington on the subject of one of our States regiments being stationed this campaign within the State. I could not think it necessary; for if I had known what your excellency had written I have not the vanity to imagine that I could have suggested any additional argument or enforced what you must have urged. However as it seemed to be your desire, and as I shall always consider your desires, tho not fully expressed, as commands, I have also written to the Genl. on that head,(4) and shall esteem myself very happy if my efforts should contribute a mite towards the granting of so reasonable a request. I wish the Genl. Assembly may succeed; but when I consider that the troops of the Virginia and No. Carolina line are gone to the Southward, and that he chuses and it is necessary that he should have a respectable army with him, I cannot promise myself that the application will prove successful.  The board of Admiralty, of which I am a member, received by last Tuesday's Post a letter from your excellency, informing them that the Pigot Galley was so rotten and so dull a Sailer that She was unfit for service, and proposing that she should be sold, all but her military stores, and another vessell purchased for a cruiser. The board sometime ago received a Letter from the Capt. of her proposing that She should be repaired and fitted out for a cruiser; they being well informed that she was but a dull sailer, that it would cost much to repair and fit her, knowing too that it was not the intention of Congress, that the Vessels procured in pursuance of the resolution for the defence of our bays & rivers should be employed as cruisers; and further thinking that the Pigot Galley might, in her present condition, afford some protection to those places were content that she might be so employed; of which I have given notice to Capt Clarke in a late letter. If Congress were disposed that a suitable vessel should be provided for the purpose you mention, which I am far from thinking they would admit; yet such is the State of the Treasury that they have it not in their power to purchase a peice of one. Indeed We have two vessels on the Stocks and for want of money we cannot even launch them. If the Galley is of no use to our State I could wish to be informed of it; for it would be wrong to keep a vessel with a  number of hands that is of no service. Willing to serve the State, thinking that the Galley might be of some benefit, and being fully sensible if She was sold it would be impossible to supply her place; because the proceeds would be otherwise applied, I induced the board to consent that she should be continued in the service. I shall put off if I can any determination on your letter until I receive an answer to this; because I plainly perceive the majority of the board will be for selling her and placing the money on the Ships now building.(5) I am with great respect Yr Exellency's most obedt. Servt  William Ellery P.S. By a letter from Genl. Washington yesterday 6 we are advised that a fleet from Cork of 45 sail had arrived at N. York and that he was informed that the enemy there were taking up transports; perhaps, I say, to carry a reinforcement to Genl. Clinton to supply the losses he sustained in his passage. Genl. Clinton the 12th of May [i.e. March] was at James-Island and had not made an Attack on Charlestown. W.E.  ""

  Sir, Philada. 4 April 1780 I know Your Excellency's awakened Attention to the publick Good, and take the Liberty to express to you the keen and oppressing Anxiety I feel at present respecting the Situation of our national Affairs. The Army is again suffering for want of Provisions; the Departments halting and deranged; Money inadequate to their Demands for procuring the Supplies; the Campaign opening upon us. APRIL 4, 1780  This is really a more critical Predicament than that of the End of the year 1776, because the Danger was then visible and every Individual was struck with the Necessity of immediate Exertion; now it is not before the Eyes of the Community, even the Legislatures themselves are not adequately roused. It has become absolutely necessary to change the Modes of Supply to avoid ruin, and the System of State-purchases is not yet in Operation. It is to be confessed that all the Measures, preparatory and not yet adopted and therefore the Legislative and Executive of the States are not blameable that our Affairs are not in a better Train. However enough is done and enough is seen to engage their immediate and constant Attention. Our Situation being critical, I would suggest to Your Excellency whether it would not be advisable that you and the Privy Council should be frequently together. If any Thing is within your Power, there never was a Time when the Practice of that Power was more indispensible. Our State has done a great Deal, has suffered a great Deal, and it seems as if a principal Dependence must still be placed upon them for some Time. Much as they have done and much as they have suffered, and however good a Right they have to be wholly relieved, it is certainly better to strain to the utmost, than that worse Consequences should ensue. The State of Pennsylvania are getting ready, but somewhat slow. It is in their Power to do much, and I trust when they get into Action their Exertions will be of great use, but no Man ought to trust his neighbour but try to do every Thing without him; all that is then done by others is clear Gain.  I doubt not your Excellency has seen the Proceedings of Congress of the 18th ulti, and the proposed Act of the State of Pennsylvania founded thereon and published for the Consideration of their Constituents.(1) I wish your Ideas upon them, and whether the People will give them the necessary Support. Excuse me in the midst of Hurry and Interruption and believe me your very obedt. hble Servt,  William Ch. Houston P.S. I am not well informed whether the Law gives the County Contractours Power to transport the Provisions and Forage to the Army, as well as to buy them. I wish it were if it is not, for it is better to buy half a Quantity of Provisions and carry them to the Army, than the whole and let it lie where purchased.  ""

  Dear Sir, April 4th 1780 As Mr. Partridge will probably be on his Way in a day or two and Mr. Adams certainly Tomorrow I must either leave you to the former, or to a Chance of my being able to write at large by the later, for a Detail of our Affairs which are much at a Stand. We print not money we are called on for millions we are in no Preparation for the Opening of a Campaign: We know not whether the States will furnish either Men or Money as we have requested. It is true, this State is about emitting pounds, Shillings & Pence instead of Dollar Currency, Perhaps Connecticutt is going into that same Practice. This tends in a measure to disjoint Unity. It was foreseen. But there appeared a universal Consent to deprive Congress Money of Value tho' that Consent at first founded the Currency. We dropped Money making. We, as a Congress, are worse off than if we had continued; will the People consent to see themselves better off. Am I not in the Hippo this morning from having only Opportunity to judge upon a single APRIL 4, 1780  and diabolical Part of the continental Race?

  My Dear Sir: Philadelphia April 5th, 1780 On the 3d Instant I was favored with Your Excellency's letter of the 30th ult.(1)  I have for ten days Successively deferred writing In hopes that I Should have been able at last to have advised you that public business was closely attended to In this quarter,(2) and that we had adopted Measures to disencumber us from that variety of embarrasment we experience, but alas! We have made little or no advances.  Mifflin, Pickering, Jones and General Sherman have furnished the first part of a Voluminous system for the Quarter master department. The Second part is to direct the Commissary General of Issues in the discharge of his Duty, and the third will point at the regulations for the Hospital. I do not mention the purchasing Department because that is to be abolished, the States are to do All; As General Sherman roundly asserts this System will strike off four thousand Officers from the Civil departments, as It is replete with absurdity and petiness It will pass into a law, unless It Should be thought proper to Confer with the Commander In Chief on the Subject. There has been some wicked work respecting a Certain appointment which Gen. Greene will advise you of Verbally.(3)  The Gentleman I have last mentioned adressed Congress in a letter of the 3d Inst wishing for their Sense on his Genral Conduct in the QMaster department,(4) a Resolution was proposed, that Congress had full Confidence In his Integrity And Ability, and requesting his future exertions-this brought on much debate, amendments were moved, and the house got Into heats, and an adjournment was deemed necessary to give the members time to Cool. A member more zealous for the Generals reputation than prudent, Observed that he was an officer In whom the Commander In Chief had the highest Confidence, that he was the first of all the Subordinate Generals In point of Military knowledge & ability, that In case of an Accident happening to Gen. Washington he would be the properest person to Command the Army, And that General Washington? thought so to, another Observed that, he had a very high Opinion of G. Greens Military abilities, that he believed the General had too, but that he believed no person on Earth was Authorized to say as much as the words above Scored, Implyed. I mention this that your Ex. may guard against any misapprehensions which this may occasion with Your officers. Gen. Greene will Inform you who delivered the Imprudent Speech.(5) APRIL 5, 1780  Yesterday Your letter of the 2d was read, there appeared a disposition in Many to leave the whole business which was the Subject of It, to Your discretion.(6) Great part of the Morning was Spent on the Subject before the resolution took place which will be transmitted by the President.  Some days Since I moved for a Committee to prepare a letter to the States to Call on them for Exertions more Competent to the Great Object we have In view. After some Altercation a Committee was appointed. Elsworth, Muhlenberg & Schuyler composed it. They prepared the letter and reported but Some Gentlemen were averse at the decisive plainess with which we Intended Congress Should address the States whilst others Contended that we should speak Still more pointedly, after a whole days Debate the letter was recommitd.(7)  I have Intreated Gen. Greene to remain a day or two longer In town that I may be able to advise with him on the Measures necessary to be procured to prevent the Ill Consequences of his being drawn to the necessity of a resignation which I conceive would at any time be an Event to be much lamented but In the present Conjuncture ruinous.

  [April 6-13, 1780](1) In Congress April 6. 1780.  Resolved, That a committee of three be appointed to proceed to Head Quarters to confer with the commander in chief on the subject of his letter of the third instant, together with the report of the board of war and the letter from Baron Steuben on the subject of a reduction of the regiments, and the report of the commissioners on the arrangement of the staff departments of the army, and that a committee of three be appointed to prepare instructions for such committee.(2)  April 12. 1780. Copy of instructions to the committee appointed to go to camp.(3)  Gentlemen  You are to confer with the commander in chief on the subjects contained in the resolution for your appointment, and such others as are committed to your charge by the following instructions.  1. You are to consult him about the propriety of reducing the number of regiments: you may with his advice reduce, incorporate or unite to state lines the several additional corps.  2. You together with the commander in chief are to limit the number of horses to be kept by the officers of the line and regimental staff, and to make such regulations with respect to the soldiers employed as servants as will, as far as is consistent with the convenience of the of ficers they serve, enable the United States to avail themselves of their services as soldiers.  3. Together with the commander in chief you are to suggest such measures, and to form such plans for the general advantage of the officers and soldiers with respect to cloathing and necessary supplies as will tend to remove all just ground of complaint, which Congress sincerely lament that there should be any room for, and to adapt them to the abilities & circumstances of these United States, and immediately to lay them before Congress. APRIL 6, 1780  4. You are to consult with the commander in chief and the commissary and quarter master general about the defects of the present system, the abuses to which it is liable, and the best methods of reforming the same. In doing this you will pay a particular attention to the report referred to you in your appointment and adopt, amend or alter the same in such manner as shall upon full consideration appear to you most adviseable, and you are hereby fully empowered to carry into execution any plan for conducting the quarter master and commissary departments which upon advice with the commander in chief and the heads thereof you shall approve; always reflecting that supplies are to be drawn forth by the respective states agreeably to the resolutions of the 25th of Feby. last.  5. You are to inquire minutely into the management of the hospitals and medical departments, & after consulting the commander in chief & director general, you are empowered to discharge unnecessary officers, to retrench expences, to abolish purveyorships, unless when they shall appear absolutely necessary. To contrive modes for checking their accounts, and to limit the number of horses which the officers of that department shall be permitted to keep, providing that they be as few as possible, bearing in mind that the resources of the country are much drained; and that it is more expedient that individuals should feel temporary inconveniencies, than to involve our affairs in general ruin.  6. You are to inquire into the management of the hide department and to reform or abolish the same, substituting contracts in the lieu thereof, if upon advising with the commander in chief it shall appear most salutary.  7. You are to pay particular attention to the department of ordnance and military stores, and after consulting with the commander in chief and the heads of the departments, to lay down such rules for the management thereof as to you shall seem necessary.  8. After the establishment of general regulations you shall visit the different posts as far as you shall judge necessary, in order to see the same carried into execution. In doing of which you are vested with joint and seperate powers; you are at liberty to call to your assistance any officer in the service of the United States, whose expences shall be borne by the states.  You are to abolish unnecessary posts, to erect others, to discharge useless officers, to stop rations, improperly issued, and are hereby further authorized to exercise every power which may be requisite to effect a reformation of abuses and the general arrangement of those departments, which are in any wise connected with the matters committed to your charge.  You are from time to time to inform Congress of the measures you have taken in consequence of these powers and instructions, & to transmit them lists of the names and occupations of the persons   you shall discharge and of those new officers, if any, which you shall find necessary to appoint.

  Dear General Philada April 6th. 1780 Col. Bull being punctual in his obliging Information of an Opportunity to convey a few Lines to you I will not omit to assure you of my Regards though I have nothing in the Line of Politics to communicate which can give you any degree of Satisfaction. I can only say that I do not despair. We are obliged to wait for money from the States, and you know that even when we printed it at double Tides, the several Army Departments were often standing still for want of it. Now therefore we can carry on nothing with Vigor.  Our Allies look to us for an active Campaign lest Negotiation should take us at a Disadvantage with an UTI POSSIDETIS; But I fear it will be a Campaign of PAL.LIATIVES, EXPEDIENTS and BOTCHES.  Col. Hazen is here and has his Heart set upon Efforts to the northward as the most economical as well as reputable Council we can take in the midst of our Difficulties. He is sanguine as to the favorable Disposition of the Canadians, and also as to his own Abilities to manage the Transportation of Provisions for 5000 three months. But I find an extreme Caution here as to the main Point of an Incursion or even Conquest on account of the Dubiousness of an after Protection, will that be in the Compass of our Strength?  By accounts from Mr. J Adams we are assured of the good dispositions of the Court of Spain but we know not whether Mr. Jay's Powers & Instructions will give entire Satisfaction there when he arrives tho it is on the Side of Probability that they will. We are drawing Bills of Exchange upon him from such a Presumption. But the Speculators here have got the better of us in this matter as well as in our Currency. For as it was not proper for us to heighten Exchange while we recommended moderate Profits to the Importer, our Draughts have been bought to be sold again under our Eyes.  God be praised the Enemy are not in Force & Vigor at New York so that our Remnant of an army is not put to the Impossiblity of either running from an immediate attack or of following the Foe pari passu to some other Station.  Something has been wrong for the Spaniards off Gibralter but I do not think the Seige is essentially affected. We are entitled to authentic Dispatches from France about this day.  I send you the February Journal without its Disgraces of Yea & Nay in long Borders.  A Letter of yours has lately been read in Congress on yr. Request.(1)  APRIL 6, 1780  Pray, had you been counted a Home Stealer or a Jockey, or what, that you chose to have that formal Communication?  Congress will not say that the Penobscot Expedition was rightfully or wrongfully undertaken or that the reasonable Expences of it shall or shall not be paid by the Continent. Nor will they attempt to direct an Expedition against the Post now held by the Enemy in that Quarter. You will perceive that I am in a Temper of much Chagrin. I do not find Men of such Minds round me as I have been accustomed to transact Business with in the first Parts of my Delegation. In short the War is grown too familiar a Thing with us. We not only are not at all allarmed, but we even do not watch, or prepare against the probable Councils of our Foe. We make somewhat of a Stir about saving when we have become pennyless: and I must own there is a large Field to exercise our Talents in as Economists.  I believe you are fully convinced by this Time of what I at first said of not giving you any Satisfaction. You must however take my Tale in good Part and continue to believe me your affectionate Friend & very humble Servant. James Lovell  ""

  Dear Sir.(1) Philadelphia April 8th 1780. May I be permitted to address you as an absent friend with no other apology than assuring you that personal respect is my principal motive.  Your constant exertions in the great cause of our Country can't but make you highly respected by all her true friends, that, has the pleasure of your acquaintance; and I am greatly mistaken if you are not sensibly effected with the distresses of our country, but it is difficult for a person to form to himself an idea of the State of affairs here; The deranged state of our Finances & want of money has greatly embarrassed every department, I have said embarrassed, I shou'd have said allmost put a total stop to every thing that respects the army; Daily demands upon Congress from every quarter & little or no money in the Treasury; It wou'd give me some Satisfaction if I knew the Hone. assembly was fully sensible of our Situation & their own danger; I am loth to add further upon so disagreeable a subject, and tho' I thought myself prepared for the greatest difficulties in this respect, yet I can truly say I have met with nothing like it since the war, and how far it is in the power of the states to relieve Congress & themselves I am not able to judge, but this I am sure of, that, it is best to exert ourselves in the ways pointed out by Congress, for by this means we have the whole strength of the union together. However (my worthy friend) don't think I despair of the great cause, no, not if the enemy should be disbanded which many suppose will soon be the case.  It would give me pleasure to converse with you upon our national affairs in Europe, but I think there wou'd be some impropriety in committing such important matters to writing if I was under no restraint, yet you may be assured that things are going on there as well as can be expected, all circumstances considered; But I have no doubt the minisr. of France and other Gentn. here of distinction from foreign nations, see with concern the distressed state to which Congress are reduced; soldiers, money, & supplies are the three principal things wanted here, but the two latter gives me the most concern, for without them it will be impossible to keep the army we have in the field; but what difficulties are unsurmountable when a virtuous & enlightened people are striving for all that is dear & all that is worth living in this world to enjoy & not ownly for them selves but for posterity.  I am, my dear Sir, with great respect, your most obedient servant.  ""

(1) You will see the Impropriety of taking the dernier pas where you are. Mrs. Schuyler did not see her Eldest daughter married. That also gave me pain, and we wish not to Experience It a Second  APRIL 8, 1780  time. I shall probably be at Camp In a few days, when we will adjust all matters.

In the mean time revolve the Matter In yours.  The pride, the folly, and perhaps too the Wickedness of some on a Certain floor Combine to frustrate every Intention to promote the public Weal and releave my amiable Chief (3) from his well grounded anxiety; The few that feel for him, and are alarmed at the critical State of our public affairs in Every department within as well as without have not been able to Carry a measure which they believed could have had Salutary Consequences. They have now proposed that a Committee should repair to head Quarters, Invested Conjointly with the General, with a kind of dictatorial power in order to afford Satisfaction to the Army and to arrange the great departments thereof.(4) Livingston, Elsworth and Mathews are appointed to prepare Instructions. Some good may result if Gentlemen who love the General are not Jealous of the army, and of a Generous turn are sent, but should General Sherman be at the head of the Triumvires the General will be tormented with the thousand littlenesses which Roger has thrown together and which he Entitles a System. I shall not be sent on this business \""because It would not be proper to send a person who as he has been In the Army will probably have a Bias in Its favor.\"" This reasoning is Conclusive.  Be so good as to desire Mrs. Cochran to Mark which and how many Yards of Silks marked on the Inclosed she wishes to have and advise me by the first Conveyance.  Beware of Communications to this quarter which you would not wish the world to know. This hint will prevent you from writing but by a safe hand.  It is amusing to observe the Effect Sir Harry Clintons private No. 15 has.(5) The Southernites have their Spirits much raised by It. The Northerns look big and the Enemy's distress is owing to their Virtue and Exertions. They wish for the 12000 russians to have the pleasure of devouring them. The war is to be at an End next winter, and as they wish to Conclude handsomely they will Insist that their Constituents compleat their Quotas without delay, and furnish aids of money &c. En verite there are only two or three of the Club who believe the letter Spurious, but two who are decidedly of that opinion. Adieu my Love to Betsy, make the same to Mrs. Cochran, my best wishes to all at head Quarters, I am Dr Sir sincerely Yours &c &c,  Ph.

  Revd. & dear Sir, Philadelphia Apl. 11 th. 1780. I had the pleasure of addressing you the 28th ulto.(1) & shou'd not have wrote again by this post, had it not been for a paragraph in a letter from you to the Honl Mr Gerry which he was so kind as to shew me, By which I perceive you are under a mistake, which I think I ought to endeavour to convince you of. In my letter of Decr. the 7th (2) to which you are pleased to refer (in yours to Mr. Gerry) I mentioned that one reason for my not writing before, was, \""the length of time between your letters & an expression in your last\"" which lead me to believe that it would be most agreeable to you, to drop our correspondence, therefore I think it can't be supposed that what you were pleased to mention to Mr Gerry was the true reason, as that affair was contained in one of your former letters; But I will now explain my self more fully & mention the very sentence which I had then reference to. You begin your address in these words, \""it lies in my mind that I am indebted to you a letter\"" the way of expression which seemed as if you had almost forgot whether it was so, or not, added to the length of time since remained unnoticed lead me to form my judgment as expressed in my letter above referred to; and I further assure you sir, upon my honor, that, what you was pleased to hold up to Mr. Gerry as your Supposed reason for my  APRIL 11, 1780  conduct had no influence upon my mind at that time, for I well remember that I understood your former letter (at the time when I read it) in the same light in which you are now pleased to explain it. I have ownly to add that I should have taken it kind if you had wrote me a few lines upon the subject, which wou'd have made it unnecessary that a third person shou'd have known any thing particular respecting our correspondence, & might have presented & any person from apprehending that I had taken exception at something that was not exceptionable.  By intelligence from Genl. Washington, yesterday, we understand that about 2000 of the enemy lately sailed from New York, supposed for Charlestown So. Carolina.  I inclose you this mornings paper which contains the news of the day.  Please to present my respectful compliments to your Lady, & believe me to remain with Sincere respect, your most obedient  ""

  My dear Sir, Philadelphia Apl. 11 th 1780 Jere returned last evening & bro't your agreeable favor (1) dated at Trenton the evening before; I was sorry after you left me that I had not directed him to wait on you, untill you overtook Mr Livermore, or to head quarters, but you may recollect the old saying that repentance always comes too late, therefore I have ownly to ask that you'l accept the will for the deed.  Agreeable to the order of the day Congress took into consideration the instructions proposed to be given to the come. to be appointed to repair to head quarters & soon after a motion was made for postponing, in order to bring before the house a resolution for making good to the officers & soldiers their pay, &c on acct. of the depreciation, which passed nem. con. after spending near the whole day in amending it to our minds.(2)  I am daily more convinced that it wou'd be most proper that the Hond. assembly shou'd determine how their Delegates in Congress shou'd be supplyed with money to bear their expences.

  Dear Brother Philadelphia April 11th. 1780  You have I hope before this recd a Letter I wrote you in answer to yours containing your project for going to Holland. (1) I am uneasy about your Last plans from an apprehention that your affairs are not in such a situation as you would wish. I can not help thinking that with your expectations it would be more proper to continue in your own country & endeavour by your industry & economy to accomodate your circumstances to your fortune, contending your self with a gradual encrease of it than quit your country & connections & leave your estate embarrassed if you should not succeed. Perhaps this thought is suggested rather by the pain I should feel in parting with you than from any other cause. I pretend not to direct, I can only pray heaven to crown your endeavours with success. In my Last I gave you reasons for my not being able to embark with you in trade. I would have you think if you do go abroad whether the Havanah or Coruna in Spain wd. not afford you good opportunities of succeeding in either of which I believe I could get you invested with a publick character. A few days will determine whether I do not go abroad myself since many of my friends are particularly earnest with me upon this subject (2) tho' I am far from wishing it myself in that case perhaps your destination may be altered. This is said in the utmost confidence & is not to be communicated. The news of this place you will find in the enclosed papers. A fleet left New York the 5th with 2000 troops on board it is said another embarkation is preparing-so that they mean to risk every thing for the conquest of Charles town. I can not hear that they are like to recive any reinforcements from Europe. I shall direct for Tillotson at the Manor as I suppose he is no longer with you.

Wherefore you are not to expect many Letters from me.  I am now standing at a Window to scratch this while Esqr. Burke is speaking.

But you may depend upon it that every Thing proper will be done for the deserving Classes of the Staff upon the Principles which have governed us as to the Line vizt.  Resolved, That when Congress shall be furnished with proper Documents to liquidate the Depreciation of the continental Bills of Credit, they will, as soon thereafter as the State of the public Finances will admit, make good to the Line of the Army & the independent Corps thereof, the Deficiency of their original Pay occasioned by such a Depreciation; and that the money and Articles heretofore paid or furnished or hereafter to be paid or furnished by Congress or the States or any of them as for Pay, Subsistance or to compensate for Deficiencies shall be deemed as advanced on Account until such Liquidation as aforesaid shall be adjusted, it being the Determination of Congress that all the Troops serving in the continental Army shall be placed on an equal footing Provided that no Persons shall have any Benefit of this Resolution except such as were engaged during the War, or for three years and are now in Service or shall hereafter engage during the War.  Resolved That a Committee of three be appointed to report a proper Compensation to the Staff of the Army in Consequence of the Depreciation of the Currency. Holten, Peabody & Burke.

Genl. Lincoln writes on the 14th March (2) that the Enemy had been lying before the Bar of Charles Town with a Number of Ships of War viz. one line of Battle, one fifty, two forty four, two Frigates, two twenty, one Sloop & a Galley, with some Transports which had been lightening the heavy Ships-their Intention to come in the first favorable Opportunity. Our Ships were anchored so as to act in Conjunction with Fort Moultrie. The Enemy had thrown up a Battery opposite the west Part of the Town, on the north Side of Wappoo Creek, from which they fired on our armed Vessels. The Balls reached the Town, but it is at too great a Distance to annoy our Works. It will prevent our Ships lying in Ashley River, which wou'd intercept their Passage, if they meant it by Boats.

Your Spirits I perceive are good, and your health, I hope will always continue as well as you can wish it. Mine I find declines apace and I am satisfied that another year's close application in Congress would make me a perpetual Citizen in Philadelphia, and give me a right to the soil from whence nothing short of the Final Judgement of this World could Eject me.

  My dear Madam Philadelphia 17th April 1780  By the last Post I was honored with your Letter of the 13th March, communicating in Confidence your Sentiments on a certain publication in the Philadelphia Paper, which had been too striking to escape the Notice of Mr. A[dams]'s Friends in this Quarter.(1)  It is not easy to ascertain the Intentions, of the philosophical Society in their Election of Mr. A s, or how far they were concerned in making such an invidious Distinction, but it is highly probable that the List was sent to the press by some of their Members, & certain it is, they might have corrected the Measure, had they disapproved thereof. Nevertheless Madam, to pursue these Enquiries, I presume, will be no Ways pleasing to You, if \""the Honor & Character\"" of our Friend can be guarded by any Mode that is more agreable, & at the same Time that promises as happy an Effect.  Previous to the Audience of Mr. Gerard, who was the first foreign Minister received by Congress, it was determined, that all Ministers plenipotentiary, whether sent to or from Congress, should have the Title of \""honorable\""; & altho this appeared to many Members unequal to the Dignity of the Office, yet, in all the publick proceedings of Congress, the Rule has been invariably observed to the present Time. Doctor F[rankli]n, Mr. A s, and Mr. J[a]y; (2) are by their respective Appointments Ministers plenipotentiary, and no one who has seen their Instructions can suppose, that the Powers of Mr. A s are less, or indeed that they are not more important than what are given to either of the other Gentlemen. D r F n's Commission not being renewed represents him to have been \""Deputy from the State of Pennsylvania to the General Congress & president to the Convention of the said State.\"" Mr. A 's \""late Commissioner of the united States of America at the Court of Versailes, late Delegate in Congress from the State of Massachusetts Bay & chief  APRIL 17, 1780  Justice of the sd State\"" and Mr. J-y's ''late president of Congress, and chief Justice of the State of New York,\"" from all which I think it evident, that whether We refer to the Commissions, Instructions or Appointments of the Gentlemen mentioned, Mr. A 's Rank is at least equal to either of the others, & by the Resolutions of Congress, he has the same Title.  But the Subject, as You justly consider it Madam, is delecate in it's Nature, & requires Measures that point not directly at the Object. I am therefore of Opinion, that it will be well, for the Information of the Friends & Correspondents of our Ministers plenipotentiary and the Secretaries of the Embassies, to publish such Circumstances as have been mentioned relative to their respective Commissions & Titles, in the same Paper in which the List of the Society was published. It may also be proper to have Mr. A____ s appointed a Member of the \""American Academy of Arts & Sciences,\"" for the Institution whereof I have been lately informed a Bill is depending in the Legislature of the State of Massachusetts; (3) & should You think it expedient to consult our Friend General Warren on the Occasion, he will undoubtedly promote the Appointment, & see that it is properly communicated to the publick. A third Mode will be attempted, but I am doubtful whether it will succeed, which is to move Congress to grant a more dignified Title than \""honorable\"" to all Ministers plenipotentiary, whether sent to or from Congress; for indeed they will always have it de Facto if not de Jure.  The Attempts mentioned in your Letter to traduce Mr. A s in France, are convincing Proofs of the Necessity of opposing every measure of this Kind, however trifling it may at first appear; & I assure You Madam that on every Occasion I shall with the greatest pleasure endeavour to support him as a particular Friend, as well as a valuable Statesman.

  Dear Sir.(1) Philadelphia April 17th. 1780. Your constant exertions in the great cause of our Country can't but make you highly respected by all her true friends; that has the pleasure of your acquaintance; Therefore in this light I hope to be considered in addition to personal respect.  It is now five years since the commencement of this war and great difficulties we have had to encounter; another campaign is opening upon us, & I am sorry to say we are poorly prepaired for it, the depreciation of our currency has greatly deranged & embarrassed our public affairs, and I might add almost put a total stop to the movements of our armies, and 'tho' I can't but suppose the Honble. Assembly are sensible of the state to which we are reduced, yet do they really consider their own danger & how much we have at stake, & not ownly ourselves but posterity, for what value are our lives & estates to us, if the common cause is not supported; but it may be said what can be done more by this people, I answer, that I think they can relieve themselves & I believe they wou'd if they were fully sensible of their danger, men, money, & provisions are the principal things wanted, but the two latter I am most concerned about, for without them it will be impossible to keep the army together; I believe you will agree with me that the recommendations of Congress shou'd be carryed fully into effect if possible for in this union of strength &  APRIL 17, 1780  exertion is our greatest security; But don't think (my worthy friend) I despair of the common cause, no, it is two good & just for me to admit a doubt of the final success; yet we may be further reduced before the good people will see their danger & exert themselves accordingly; Congress are sensible of their situation & are exerting themselves to put a stop to all unnecessary expences in the great departments of the army & to that end have lately appointed a come. with very great powers, they are to endeavour to find out the abuses & rectify them & to carry their plans into effect even before they report to congress; The unnecessary expences in these departments (I make no doubt) has been great, but it is not so much to be wondered at when we consider how we were driven into this war.  I intended to have wrote you more particularly respecting our national affairs in Europe, but have ownly time to add, that from the best intelligence, I have reason to believe that things are going on there as well as can be expected all circumstances considered; But I make no doubt the minister of France & other Gentn. of distinction here (from foreign Nations) see with concern to what state Congress are reduced.

  Sir, Philadelphia Apl. 18th. 1780. Your excellency in a letter of the 8th of last March informed me, that the account of the State against the United States was very large and that it would soon be forwarded.(1) The sooner it comes to hand the better. Very lately a draft was reported on our State for five hundred thousand dollars in favour of the late Commissary Genl. I opposed it with all my might, told Congress that a warrant for that sum would exhaust the last farthing of the debt due on our quota of taxes, and that I daily expected that the State would present their accounts and demand a very large ballance. In this way I got it reduced to one hundred thousand dollars.(2) The people urge so pressingly the payment of their debts, and it is so necessary to preserve or rather recover credit, that warrants are continually issueing whereever there is any prospect of their being answered. The want of punctuality in paying their taxes where the quotas were large, has depretiated the money greatly, and greatly embarrassed our Affairs.  I acquainted your Excellency in my last that I had written to Genl. Washington as I was requested.(3) The Genl. writes me that he had informed you of the improbability of his being able to comply with your request. I hope however that the recruits the army may receive may still render it prudent for him to continue the battalion of blacks in the State.  I have lately received a letter from Genl. Varnum informing me that he was directed by the Genl. Assembly to request me to act and do every thing necessary in behalf of the State for their obtaining a confirmation of the decree in favor of the State against the Sloop Crawford. No appeal hath been lodged with the Secretary, notwithstanding months have elapsed since it was granted, and therefore I presume the Appellants do not mean to prosecute it.(4) Fees are enormously high here; and it would be impossible for me to get money enough to fee Council without hiring money the treasury [is] so much exhausted, and therefore I hope the matter will be dropped by the Appellants.  A fleet of 12 ships of the line have arrived at Martinico with a number of troops, which gives the french a superiority in the W.  APRIL 18, 1780  Indias. I wish they could spare us half of them to be employed agst the enemy to the Southward.  We have no late intelligence from Genl. Lincoln. Troops are constantly marching into South-Carolina I am informed and it is expected that if we are able to keep possession of the harbour of Charlestown, we shall have force enough by land to keep the town.  A Committee hath lately been appointed to repair to head quarters to arrange departments &c &c &c. Inclosed is a copy of the instructions given to them; which points out their business more particularly than I could do it by a relation. It is expected that great advantage will result to the public from this measure.  Congress have too passed an act for making good to the line of the army and the independant corps thereof, the deficiency of their original pay &c.(5) This I also take the liberty to inclose to your excellency. These are the most material acts which have passed Congress; since I last had the honour of writing to you.  We are upon a plan for liquidating the value of Loan-Office certificates, determining to do justice to the holders of them as exactly as possible; when this is agreed to, I will transmit it.(6)  As I have done I mean to give every information, and to perform every service in my power, which may be beneficial to the State, so long as I shall continue to represent it in Congress; and whenever my constituents shall please to displace me, I shall go out with the satisfaction of having discharged my duty at least with firmness & integrity.

  Dear Sir, (Private.) Philadelphia April 18th 1780. The news papers announce all the foreign Intelligence received by Congress and something more, except that of the Enemy's Intended plan of operations for the Opening Campaign which we believe we are possessed of. I enter not Into a Minute detail, least this letter Should Miscarry; let It Suffice to observe to your Excellency, that I think It will, on their parts, Evaporate as the last did especially to the Northward, If Supplies can be furnished for the Army To the Southward, I fear they will make an extensive penetration Into South Carolina, for I have no great hopes that the troops In Charlestown will be able to make Effectuall opposition. I wish they may not be Caged; all was well there on the 21st ult. but a private letter of a later date advises that the Roebuck had passed the bar and would have her Cannon on board In ten hours. If this is fact, we shall soon have some serious Intelligence from thence.  The Enemy have published one of my Letters which they took from Mr. Crane at Paramus; (1) one to Your Excellency, another to Mrs. Schuyler & a third to Colo. Lewis have not Yet appeared In print (2)-their view in publishing mine appears to be to announce to their friends that we were under some difficulty with respect to our Finances, for it otherwise afforded them little consolation.  Maryland & Delaware continue unrepresented, so that the Vermont business still hangs by the Eyelids.  APRIL 19, 1780  Mr. Livingston is gone into Jersey.(3) I am one of a Committee directed to repair to the army, for the purpose of arranging all the staff departments, thereof; this business and that of visiting the different posts East of Jersey will take much of my time, so that General Scott will be left alone, and altho our business will not Suffer In his hands, Yet Sickness may prevent his constant attendance; would It not, therefore, be prudent to hasten Mr. Duane on. I hope Your Excellency has received the act of Congress allowing pay & subsistance to the men to be raised for the defence of our frontiers.(4)  Please to make my respects acceptable to Mrs. Clinton.

  Sir Philadelphia April l9th. 1780  I was in hopes to have been able before this Time to inform You of some effectual Measures in Congress for reducing the Seditious in the northeastern parts of our State (1) to a due Submission to Government. That Business was the Order of the day, very shortly after my Arrival hither; but the alarming Derangement of Finance compelled us to give Way to the pressing Request of Congress for giving the preference to that Business of interesting & universal Concern. The Transaction of that Business consumed so much Time, that Maryland became unrepresented by the death of Mr. Forbes.(2) In consequence of this, Georgia being also unrepresented, & the three States of N. Hampshire, Massachusets and N. York being by the express Terms of the Resolution of Congress excluded from voting in the Controversy, We have hitherto had no Opportunity of bringing on our Case. A Representation from Maryland is daily expected. When that takes place I shall endeavor to bring it on without the Loss of a Moment, tho' under great Disadvantages. General Schuyler is going on a Committee to Head Quarters for reforming the Staff &ca, to be attended with a Visitation of the Posts; which will render his Return before Autumn improbable. Messrs. Floyd & L'Hommedieu have returned home some Time since. Mr Livingston is gone to attend on his Lady at her Fathers; and from thence he intends to return to our State; having left Me slender hopes of his coming to Congress again unless sent for-So that in two days I shall be left alone to represent the State & manage the Affair of our Eastern Boundary. As far however as concerns the Question of Jurisdiction between the three States on the one part, and the Grants on the other part which is to be determined by Congress itself, I shall press forward without the Loss of a Moment; hoping tho' not waiting for Mr Duane, to whom I wrote some Time since,(3) requesting his immediate Attendance. I must entreat You to urge him to it. The Law respecting our Western Boundary was laid before Congress soon after it was recd.(4) It was agreably received by some Members, as an Instance of our Generosity; by others with some Jealousy. A Committee however was appointed to take it into Consideration & Report; but on a disagreement they were discharged. I will endeavor to get another appointed; for tho' we cannot by the Terms of the Law do any thing conclusively without the presence of three of our delegates, yet the Matter may be put en train. Give Me Leave Sir thro' You to APRIL 19, 1780  urge the State with the most pressing Instance, to adopt our plan of Finance, however it may in the Judgement of some be not so clear of Objections as might be wished. The Dye is cast & for certain Reasons which it may not be proper to express, the more especially as they must be sufficiently obvious to You, the plan must be complied with. Let Me also in the most urgent Manner press the immediate filling up of our Battalions, if since the last returns they should require it, & the prompt Levy & payment of our Taxes, & Contribution of the specific Supplies for the Army. I need not particularize, for I suppose You well know how extreamely pressing the demands of the Continent are on those Subjects.  A Resolution lately passed Congress for making good at a future day the Deficiencies in the pay of the Line of the Army occasioned by depreciation. I am happy to hear that it gives the honest brave fellows high Satisfaction. Something of this kind will be done for the Staff or at least a part of it when it shall be reformed. I inclose You in Substance the proceedings of Congress of yesterday on Loan Office Certificates.(5) Unluckily I was attending the Board of War when the Business was brought on; but I shall move for a Reconsideration of the Resolution for the Evident Mischief contained in the latter part of it. These are my Reasons #(1) The Certificates are negotiable & therefore, as well as the Bills of Credit a circulating Medium.#(2) They have an advantage over the other because they bear interest. They will therefore depriciate the other and work agt. the Plan of Finance by encouraging Speculation & thereby preventing the Fixation of Bills of Credit at 40 for one. #(3) Public Credit is no more engaged for supporting them than the other; and the Establishmt. Of them on the footing of the Resolution, arraigns the Justice of the Plan of Finance with respect to the Bills of Credit. #(4) Strict Justice requires no more than that the Purchase Money & the Interest be paid to the Purchasor. #(5) No Member of Community ought to be allowed to jobb in the Public Funds because such Commerce must be injurious to the Community. #(6) It will be dangerous to the Liberties of America by contributing to the Destruction of that Equality of Property which is essential to the Existence of Republics. #(7) If it will be subversive of the Plan of Finance respecting the Bills of Credit, it will be subversive of the Liberties of America; because the Continuance of the War to Advantage will necessarily depend on the due Execution of that Plan.  I could wish the Printed Copies of the Laws passed the last Meeting of the Legislature may be sent us as soon as possible; & beg to be informed when the next meeting will be.  All prospect of removing from this Place for some time to come is at an End. For however disgusting our Stay here is to Congress and the Inhabitants, our removal at the Opening of a Campaign   would probably be attended with the Loss of a Month; and therefore with too much danger to permit the Attempt.  We are in great Fear for Charles Town; and our Fear is increased by the retreat of our Naval Force (which I apprehend is not well commanded) from the Bar to Sullivan's Island. Should the Enemy pass Fort Moultrie on that Island & drive our Ships from that Station they would possess themselves of Cooper River with a naval force most probably sufficient to compel the Evacuation of the Town, & reduce General Lincoln to the Necessity of covering the Country with our whole force. We find however much Consolation in the Confidence We place in the cool firmness & good Sense of the General, and his Zeal in the Service, tho' We feel ourselves much disappointed at the Abandonment of the Bar; over which by the last Accots (22d Ult.) the Roebuck had got, & would be able to get her Cannon mounted again in 10 hours. We have had no of ficial accounts from thence since the 14th Ult. and are big with hourly Expectations.  Some Time since we were (tho' not officially but I believe truly) informed of the Enemies Plan of Operations for the ensuing Campaign.(6) It is as follows to secure the Posts of Hallifax, Penobscot, N. York, Charlestown & Savannah; to enable them, on a Treaty of Peace to claim a Cession of the Province of Main, South Carolina & Georgia. This System is verified by an original Letter from a Campbel in Britain to his Son a Lieutent. & Adjutant in a British Regiment here; wherein he informs him that the Plan is to secure the Posts at Hallifax, Penobscot, New York, Portsmouth in Virginia, Charlestown, Savannah & St Augustine, to act defensively at these Posts, & offensively agt. the Trade of America. The Letter was taken in a Prize bound to Georgia & has been transmitted to a Member of & read in Congress. We have no later News from Europe than an Accot. of the disaster of our Friends the Spaniards off Gibraltar-not so heightened as the British Accot. makes it; which however I believe is nearest the Truth. It is a capital Stroke against Us; for which we daily comfort ourselves with an Expectation of good News from the two Floridas. No Accounts yet of Mr Jay's Arrival. We are strangely destitute of Intelligence from that Quarter. I wish Philosophy there may not have taken Place of Politics too much. An attempt to send a Resident to the Court of France, which had the Voice of N York, has miscarried. A Secretary is now to be appointed, the Gent. we had in View for a Resident will not accept the Secretaryship. For obvious Reasons We shall endeavor to get one from the Southward.(7)  As Lieut. Colonel Reignier of the 2d New York Battalion has resigned (8) I hope Major Fish's Rank & Merit will claim the Attention of the Council of Appointment for this Vacancy, which I believe is his undoubted Right in our Line especially as the Vacancy is in his Regiment. A Resolution has been passed on the recommendation of  the Board of War agt. making new Appointments,(9) with an Eye to a Reduction of the Army; but was not intended to Prevent Promotions; which is the Birthright of an Officer & of which he cannot while in service be deprived without great Injustice & a discouragement to the Service. The executive Council of this State have lately called on the Board of War for their Sense on the Resolution. We have given it as above; and I believe they are acting upon it. I hope our Council will secure to our Line their Promotion; and should it be extended to the Major I should, while I consider him as a Son, esteem & have a grateful Sense of it, as a Promotion in my Family.  I must again intreat You, Sir, to urge Mr Duanes immediate Attendance. A single representation, considering the Danger of Accidents, is too precarious to be relied on. Beg him to bring with him all the Evidence he has collected since my departure, & particularly authenticated Copies of the 2d & 3d Cession of the five Nations, for their Country of Habitation & their Beaver hunting Country acquired by the Sword. The first Cession I have. Since our last Instructions we have avoided without Suspicion, any Explanations with New Hampshire; they are warmly opposed with Us to Vermont. Half of their Present Representation is as warm agt. & Jealous of Massachusets & Connecticut, as of Vermont. Massachusets has not yet passed her Act of Submission; and I believe, she intends to lie by till a future opportunity. However Congress must by the Express Words of their Resolution proceed between the Grants & such of the three States as have submitted. So that as soon as Maryland is represented I shall insist on their taking up the Business.  I wish to make my Compliments to your good Lady acceptable as well as to all my friends & acquaintances at Poghkepsie & its Environs as if they were particularly named.  I have the Honor to be with, Great Respect, Your Excellency's most obedt Servt. Jno. Morin Scott  P.S. Pray let Me [be] favored with a Line as often as You have nothing else to do.  ""

The Chevalier Luzern Minister of France his Secretary and my old Acquaintance Don Juan Miralles, who all reached Head Quarters on a Visit the day after my Arrival. The Minister appears to be a polite Gentleman of easy manners, very affable & attentive. Monsieur Gerard the late minister, he says, mentiond me to him with particular Regard. The Secretary Monsieur Marebois is a Gentleman of great Knowledge and agreeable address, & every way calculated to please. They with the Don are here merely on a military Visit. There is to be a Review and Ball on Monday for their Entertainment, but I shall stay no longer than to have an Interview with General Schuyler who will be up to morrow with a Committee on Business with the Commander in Chief & be detaind probably a fortnight or longer. I do not wish to go forward till I have some Conversation with him on the State of our publick Affairs: especially as I hear the Chancellor (2) has left Congress with an Intention to return home.  We have no news from South Carolina to be depended upon later than the 14t March. At that time the Enemy had made no Impression; but from every appearance they meant to beseige the Town in form. They have a very considerable Land force; indeed they have bent almost their whole strength against that State, and I am not without Apprehensions for the Event.

The loss of South Carolina (which we must every momet look for) will involve in it consequences, truely alarming to the Union. Their extensiveness a few moments reflection will suggest to you.

  Dear Sir. Philadelphia Apl. 28th 1780. I have been favored with yours of the 9th instant; & am sorry to hear the merchants are dissatisfyed with the important resolutions of Congress of the 18th ultimo, which in my opinion so much under God depends, 'tho' it is no more than I expected for it is not likely that their first consideration was whither they will relieve their distressed Country, but how they will answer their own present purposes in way of trade.  I have the pleasure of corresponding with a number of Gentlemen in Court & out, but by their letters, they do not appear to be fully sensible of the distressed state to which our Country is reduced, owing to the depreciation of our currency for it has not ownly deranged & embarrassed the public affairs, but allmost put a total stop to all our proceedings? Congress have lately agreed upon a circular letter to the several States which I suppose will come to hand before this, and they have mentioned some of the great difficulties they labour under, so far as was thought adviseable, but it is far short (in my opinion) of our distressed & reduced situation; How far it is in the power of the states to relieve us I am not able to say, money, & provisions are the two principal things wanted for without them it will be impossible to keep the army together; By the resolutions mentioned above I think it must appear that if they were carryd. into effect it wou'd immediately help Congress to a sufficient sum of money to carry us thro' this campaign, and I have no doubt there is provisions sufficient in the country if the States can collect them, but it is not in the power of Congress to do it, unless they should take such measures as wou'd be verry distressing to the Citizens near the armies. The daily demands upon Congress for money from every department is great, in addition to their numerous complaints, and 'tho' I thought myself well prepaired for difficulties of this nature yet I must confess, I have met with nothing like it since the war commenced; But don't think (my worthy friend) I despair of the common cause, no, not if the army shou'd disband, as I am frequently told will soon be the case.

  Sir: Philadelphia, May 2, 1780. Nothing new in the Congressional line hath taken place since our last, but what will have reached your Excellency's hands before this. The frigate Confederacy arrived here last Saturday, from Martinico, and confirms the account of the arrival there of sixteen sail of the line, with a considerable body of troops, so that now the French have a decided superiority in the West Indies.  An express arrived here last evening with despatches from Gen. Lincoln, to the 9th of April, the substance of which is, that the enemy crossed the Ashley river in force, near the ferry, on the 29th ult., and encamped about three thousand yards from our line. They have erected works in front and on the left, and on Cooper's river, and were opening lines of communication. What they have done seems rather calculated to cover their approaches than to annoy. Seven ships of war passed Fort Moultrie on the 8th, and anchored near where Fort Johnston stood, without any apparent injury. Our people were employed in throwing obstructions in the passage up Cooper's river, thereby to preserve a communication with the country, from which they might draw succors and supplies, and meant to throw up works in proper places, the more effectually to secure that communication. General Woodford, with about seven or eight hundred MAY 2, 1780  of the Virginia line, arrived the 7th, and the North Carolina men were coming in. The remainder of Gen. Scott's troops, and some militia men from North Carolina, were soon expected.  We do not pretend to form a judgment of the results. The events of war are uncertain, and your Excellency can make up as good a one as we are able to do. Hoping every thing will eventually turn out well, we are with great respect,  Your Excellency's most obedient servants,  William Ellery, John Collins.  P. S. Mr. Ellery has received your Excellency's letters respecting the Pigot Galley, and will lay the same before the Admiralty Board.(1)  MS not found; reprinted from Staples, Rhode Island, pp. 281-82.  1 In an April 17 letter to William Ellery, a member of the Board of Admiralty, Governor Greene had requested a replacement for the Pigot-to \"" scour the coast of small armed vessels.\"" Staples, Rhode Island, p. 279.

  My dear General Philadelphia 4th May 1780 We are here in anxious Suspence for the Fate of Charles Town: it is not to be wondered at when we consider the greatness of the Stake, and the Uncertainty and Importance of the Event. The Governour, Council and Magistracy have shut themselves up in the Town determined to share the Glory of preserving it, or to perish in the Attempt! We understand that this Resolution was submitted to with Reluctance by the principal Officers of the Army, and in my Opinion it is rather a display of Heroism then of deliberate Policy. The Influence of Goverment would have been well employed, as far as we can Judge at so remote a distance, in preparing against a Disaster and drawing the Internal Strength of the Country to some point for it's Defence. On the present plan the Loss of the whole State seems to be hazarded with the Capital. We learn from a Mr Cannon who left the neighbourhood of Charles Town on the 12th and parted with General Lincoln on the 9th, that the Garrison and Inhabitants were greatly elated on the Arrival of the Virginia Line; and in full expectation of Success: and it is his opinion that if the Maryland Line were near the Scene of Action Sir Henry Clinton woud be glad to raise the Siege. We have endeavourd to learn from Him the Sentiments of General Lincoln on the Fate of the Town: but it appears that he is as reserved in his Conversation as his Letters 'tho his Activity & Vigour inspire the highest Respect and Confidence. These Circumstances do not appear in any Correspondence and I conclude tho' they are not very material you will not think them too trivial to be communicated.  We are exerting every Means in our power to expedite the March of the Reinforcement destined for Charles Town. It is committed to the Joint Efforts of the Board of War and the Treasury and I hope every Obstacle is surmounted. I have but one wish left, that Virginia may on so decisive and interesting an Occasion be able to detach a Body of Militia which in Conjunction with the Continental Reinforcements will be sufficient to support the Communication between the Town and Country and harrass the Besiegers in their Rear. The Reluctance against the Southern Service, tho' easy to be accounted for, is much to be deplored; and I reconcile myself to the Embarrasments which our Weakness in that Quarter Superadds to all our other Difficulties.  MAY 4, 1780  In spite of the disagreeable Aspect of our money Affairs I look forward to a happy Termination of our arduous Conflict. We have not experienced half the distresses which considering the power of our Enemies, every contemplative Mind must have expected. I am in this View much engaged in another Attempt to get the Confederation accomplished which in my Opinion woud fully compensate for the temporary Loss of any City on the Continent: & it gives me great pleasure to assure your Excellency that the Delegates from Virginia are warmly disposed to give it all the Aid in their power: & I indeed have the fullest Expectation that our Joint Exertions will Succeed: and the future Safety and Tranquillity of the States be fixed on a permanent Basis. Without a Federal Alliance peace itself, Independance, and Security from external Assaults, would scarcely deserve the Name of a Blessing. The flame of disaffection to the British Administration has at length reached the Bosom of our Enemies. Remonstrances and Committees, always terrible to an Arbitrary Government, cannot fail of producing Embarrasment in publick Councils, or of enfeebling the National Exertions. We have a Right to hope that they will be attended with Serious Consequences, and put an End to their Operations against these States. If Brittain unsupported by Friends or Allies, and rent asunder by domestic Jars and discontents, can continue an unjust and unpopular War against the Joint Efforts of America, France and Spain, she will exhibit an Example of Obstinacy and of Vigour unparallelled in History.  To hold a place in your Excellency's Confidence & Friendship is an Honour which I most highly prize; & which I shall always regard as one of the most happy Circumstances of my Life: for no Man can be more entirely Attached to you by every Tie of Affection, Esteem & Gratitude than my dear General, Your most Obedient & most faithful Servant,  Jas. Duane  P.S. Be pleased to present my most respectful Compliments to Mrs. Washington & the Gentlemen of the Family. We have this moment Letters informing us that Connecticut & the Massachusetts Legislatures have chearfully adopted the new plan of Finance.(1) The Connecticut Leaders have done themselves great Honour as well as the principal Farmers. The former in an Address to the Assembly declare their Readiness to receive the new Money at its Value specified by Congress in payment for their Commodities. New York I am perswaded will Concur & their Example will probably bring All the States into the Measure.  ""

  Sir, Philadelphia May 4th. 1780 The appointment of Congress to the Court of appeals does me great honor. (1) I thank them exceedingly for the confidence they repose in my Integrity and abilities, but as the nomination was unsolictied and even unknown to me, and being delegated by the state of Virginia to a very different employment I do not think myself justifiable in a peremtory acceptation of the office without the approbation of my constituents. In the mean time, the state of Virginia being so ably and fully represented without my attendance, if Congress shall think proper I will undertake the business of a Judge and endeavor to pay that attention which so important and distinguished a commission may require.

The last bottle had been broached. We addressed congress,(3) and used every argument in our power to induce them to order a couple of pipes to be sent to head-quarters, and told them that the general's wine was entirely exhausted. They doubted. We informed them that we had received a letter from the committee giving us that information.(4) They still doubted, and desired that the letter might be produced. We delivered it with the utmost reluctance.

  My dear sir, Philadelphia 5th May 1780 It gave me great Pleasure to learn by your Letter of the 11th Decr. that You had safely arrived, and had met with so agreable a Reception in Spain: (1) & I hope soon to have the Satisfaction of hearing from You at Paris.  Mr Lovell informs me that he shall transmit You the Journals of Congress & News Papers (2) by the latter of which You will perceive that the Enemy have invested Charlestown, & that it is defended by General Lincoln with about four or five thousand Men, the greatest part whereof are continental Troops. General De Kalb with the whole of the Maryland Corps, consisting as I am informed of between two & three thousand Men, is ordered to Charlestown from the main Army, & has by this Time probably crossed the Cheesapeak: Reinforcements of Militia are also on the March from Virginia & North Carolina, all of which should Charlestown hold out about a Month or five Weeks must I think make a formidable Army, in the rear of the Enemy. The Garrison by the best Accounts are supplied with five or six Months provision, & have a sufficiency of military Stores; & altho the General in his publick Letters is exceedingly modest & confines himself to States of Facts, yet in one of his private confidential Letters he expresses his Hopes & Expectations of being able  MAY 5, 1780  to defend the City, or of making the Acquisition expensive to the Enemy.  The Resolutions of Congress for calling in & canceling the two hundred Millions of Dollars emitted by them, have in general been well received. (3) The Depreciation is stopt, & Specie, which before the passing of the Resolves was sold for upwards of 70 for 1, is now current at 60 & has been lately at 55. The Advantage of this Plan will be great to the Land holders, inasmuch as the national Debt including Certificates & foreign Demands does not now much exceed five Million sterling, which is but a trifling Sum compared with the two hundred Millions sterling due from G Britain. Another Benefit resulting from it, is a Supply of five Million Dollars of the new Emission, every Dollar of which is equal to 40 Dollars of the old Emissions; indeed this must be called in before that can be realized, nevertheless, there is a greater Demand amongst all Ranks for continental Money than there has been since the Commencement of the War, & Specie is no longer hoarded by the disaffected or timid. So much for the Value & Stability of the Medium. With Respect to our Resources Congress are at present much in Want of Money, & it is a happy Circumstance; for, their economy is in proportion to their Wants. The Demands on the Treasury are generally answered by Warrants on the several States which are careful by some Means or other to discharge the Draughts. The Taxes are indeed very heavy, but the Collection goes on, & I doubt not that the Army will be well fed & paid. Military Stores & Cloathing must however be procured on Credit in Europe, as well as a considerable Loan to serve as a Fund for drawing in Case of Necessity. Since the Treasury, Admiralty, & Court of Appeals have been put in Commission, Congress have not been troubled much with their respective Concerns, & for several Days past have adjourned before the usual Time from a Want of Business.  Trade & privateering are brisk, & there is a plenty of Goods of every Kind (exceptng military), but no Money to purchase them. This is easily accounted for, since the whole Sum in Circulation as Congress have fixed it, is only five Million Dollars, & these are not one third of what are necessary for a Medium for the several States. Our privateers & Commerce have nevertheless lately suffered much by the Cruisers of the Enemy, who have the Command of the Coast. It is much to be wished that the Court of France would order a squadron superior to the Enemy to be stationed in some part of the united States, as the best & only Means of putting a speedy End to the War. It is almost impossible to conceive the Havock that our privateers made of the Enemy's Cruisers & Transports during the Time that the Count D'Estaign was at Rhode Island & Charlestown, but our Losses at present nearly equal our Captures. Indeed that worthy Officer aware of those & other advantages ordered the Count de Gras  to be stationed at the Cheesapeak, but his plan was defeated by the Tempestuousness of the Weather. Had the latter arrived with his Squadron, Charlestown could not have been beseiged & three or four of our Frigates which are now in Ashley River & will probably be destroyed, would have been employed in intercepting the Enemy's Transports.  We have had a very severe Winter & backward Spring, but the prospects are not unfavorable.  I had forgot to mention a Resolution of Congress to pay off the Continental Certificates according to the Value of Money at the Time of their being respectively issued. This is but Justice, & will undoubtedly be satisfactory to Foreigners.  Bills of Exchange are now at 45 for one, & will be higher, in Consequence of the great Risque of sending Vessels from the eastern States to the southern for produce.  I have had the pleasure of a Line from Portia, (4) whose Sentiments are sufficient proof of a Mens sana in Corpore sano.(5) Poor Don Juan de Merailles lately died at Camp, on a Visit with the Minister of France to General Washington. I have many Things more to say to You but the Vessel is to sail immediately & I have scarcely Time to send my sincere Regards to brother Dana or to assure You that I remain sir with every Sentiment of Esteem & Respect Your affectionate Friend, E Gerry  [P.S.] Mr Lovell will give You the necessary Information respecting your Accounts.

  Dear Sir. Philadelphia May 5th 1780. Four days since I was favored with yours of the 10th ulto. & thank you for the information therein given.  To answer your letter fully wou'd be to commit to paper that which I dare not by any means do, & therefore I desire you to consider me as writing under restraint, 'tho with an inclination to write freely.  I consider it as unnecessary to mention to you under what disadvantages we engaged in this war with one of the greatest powers on earth, they can't but still remain upon a mind like yours? While Congress emited bills & the good people tho't they were growing rich, there was no great complaints (ownly of the enemies cruelty), but nowithstanding all the endeavours of congress they depreciated to such a degreee & still increasing, that the good people (in these parts) were more alarmed than by the late resolutions you are pleased to mention, & what added to the difficulty was, they tho't it was in a great measure owing to Congress's continuing to make paper bills; & therefore petitioned in great numbers to stop the press & tell them what to do & they wou'd exert themselves to the utmost to support the common cause; Notwithstanding, Congress was aware of the difficulties attending the stoping the press as well as the dangr. of keeping it open, and of two great difficulties they chose that which they tho't the least, & I believe have never repented it; However they took care not to stop it 'till they were able to finish the last campaign which they had reason to hope wou'd be the last and upon stoping the press they informed their constituents how long they cou'd go on without taxes being paid in, & let them know what they tho't wou'd be the consequences if they were not supplied with money according to their recommendations & notwithstanding the good intentions & exertions of the people, they have not been able to supply us? And now, sir, I wou'd ask your attention to take a short view of our distressed & reduced state for four months past; an empty treasury & a Starving army not paid for some time & poorly cloathed &c, &c, &c; Please to consider our worthy Genl. using his great influence with the exertions of congress to git the good citizens near the army to supply their wants, without which they must disband; view the civil magistrates & Citizens exerting themselves & supplying them even to the last provisions they had, & their families, in consequence thereof, ready to starve around them, coming to Congress for pay MAY 5, 1780  & they unable to afford them relief? Under these circumstances were the bills drawing you refer to, in order to raise money for immediate use; But not long after we had letters from our Minister sent to the Court of Spain that he had met with misfortunes at sea which wou'd hinder his arrival so soon as was expected, & that our agent sent to Holland was disappointed & detained in South Carolina, (1) these were some of the reasons why Congress stoped drawing and dispairing of fixing their currency without calling in the whole by taxes as many people took all possible advantage by Congress's selling them so low.  I consider it as unnecessary to point out to so great a statesman as your Honor the immediate relief the public wou'd receive from the resolutions of Congress of the 18th of March if they were carried into effect.  Congress as Congress, can't want my assistance to Support or justify their proceedings, but they have to lament.(2)  ""

  Dear Sir, Philada. 6 May 1780 Yours of the 17th March last continued to the 20th I received on the 23d and thank you for the Observations on several Subjects which it contains.(1) The only Thing I can at present find Intermission from Business to reply to is what I suppose will imediately engage the Deliberations of the Legislature, I mean the Resolutions of 18 March last upon Finance.  The operation of so large a Tax, as you observe, would probably have affected the Money, if it were punctually paid, and, when paid, adequate to the publick Exigencies; throwing out of the Question altogether [. . .] any Part of the Collection; because the Prices are [fairly?] proportionate to the Quantity in Circulation. But the great Difficulty is that the Taxes never have been punctually paid, and, if they were, even adding Loans to them, would not accumulate a Fund adequate to the publick Expenditures at present. The Prices will not fall rapidly, indeed it is not perhaps best they should; and after every reformation in the publick Departments, which can be made, shall be made, some other Means must be adduced in Assistance of Loans and Taxes to pay off the publick Debts and continue the Operations of the War. This Plan of Finance is therefore calculated to neat Money into the Treasury, and to this, among other indispensible Objects, one of which is, if possible, to give some Equilibrium to the Medium, the several Parts of it were necessarily pointed. You also know it has long been the importunate Intreaty and wish of the People, \""fix the Value of the money somewhere little Matter at what if it can be prevented from fluctuating. It is the Fluctuation more than the reduction of value, as far as these can be separated and distinquished, that perplexes and embarrasses every Thing.\"" This will, I think turn the Tide of Depreciation, and have a Tendency to poise the value somewhere if it can have Time to operate, and if the publick Exigencies do not press so intolerably, that Congress may be under the Necessity of taking some Measure which may give the Course of it an unlucky Touch, and derange the whole. I am fully convinced that a Plan regularly adhered to, if not quite so wise, will produce better Effects, than desultory, altering and temporary Expedients often mended and corrected before they have Time to produce any steady Effects.  I hope our Legislature will adopt the Plan, not only because I think it of publick Expediency, but because it seems to be well received as far as I have heard every where but in this-City-No Object of Imitation believe me. But even here most who understand it, approve it. It is adopted eagerly to the Eastward,(2) though Exchange was lower there than anywhere else on the Continent. I wish the Legislature MAY 6, 1780  [would] consider the Propriety of putting a Clause in the Bill to allow any one that pleased to bring in his Money and have it exchanged, still going on with the Taxes. One Reason is this, I foresee that it will be necessary to take in the Certificates in the Staff Departments for Taxes. They have contracted Debts almost beyond Computation as if they had been employed for no other Purpose than to try how much they could owe. What is become of the Purchases does not appear as yet. This will indeed be a way of paying some of the publick Debts, I am sorry it is not a better one, but it will bring no Money into the Treasury. Therefore we shall be behind in our Taxes, and they must continue longer to get in the Money, if it is not got in some other Way. And should it all come in by Exchange, the Taxes can go on at a fourtieth for the Prosecution of the War or any other necessary Purpose.  The State of New York I observe have ordered the Certificates in that State, given by the Quarter Master's and Commissary's Departments receivable in Taxes; and notwithstanding we have resorted to every possible Expedient to get the Debts paid off in our State, we can effect Nothing to Purpose, and Mr. Dunham was obliged to go away a few Days ago empty. I suppose therefore we shall have to do as New York have done. Have more to say, but neither Time nor Room. Am, as always Yours &c, William C Houston (3)  ""

  Dear Sir Philada. May 6th. 1780 I am sorry I can give you no other account of our public situation than that it continues equally perplexed & alarming as when I lately gave you a sketch of it. (1) Our army has as yet been kept from starving and public measures from a total stagnation by draughts on the States for the unpaid requisitions. The great amount of these you may judge of from the share that has fallen to Virginia. The discharge of debts due from the purchasing departments has absorbed a great proportion of them, and very large demands still remain. As soon as the draughts amount to the whole of the monthly requisitions up to the end of March, they must cease according to the new scheme of finance. We must then depend wholly on the emissions to be made in pursuance of that scheme which can only be applied as the old emissions are collected & destroyed. Should this not be done as fast as the current expenditures require, or should the new emissions fall onto a course of depreciation both of which may but too justly be feared a most melancholy crisis must take place. A punctual compliance on the part of the States with the specific supplies will indeed render much less money necessary than would otherwise be wanted, but experience by no means affords satisfactory encouragement that due and unanimous exertions will be made for that purpose not to mention that our distress is so pressing that it is uncertain whether any exertions of that kind can give relief in time. It occurs besides, that as the ability of the people to comply with the pecuniary requisitions is derived from the sale of their commodities, a requisition of the latter must make the former proportionally more difficult and defective. Congress have the satisfaction however to be informed that the legislature of Connecticut have taken the most vigorous steps for supplying their quota both of money & commodities and that a body of their principal merchants have associated for supporting the credit of the new paper, for which purpose they have in a public address pledged their faith to the Assembly to sell their merchandise on the same terms for it as if they were to be paid in specie. A similar vigor throughout the Union may perhaps produce effects as far exceeding our present hopes as they have heretofore fallen short of our wishes.  It is to be observed that the situation of Congress has undergone a total change from what it originally was. Whilst they exercised the indefinite power of emitting money on the credit of their constituents they had the whole wealth & resources of the continent within their command, and could go on with their affairs independently and as they pleased. Since the resolution passed for shutting the press, this power has been entirly given up and they are now as dependent on the States as the King of England is on the parliament. They can neither enlist pay nor feed a single soldier, nor execute any other  MAY 6, 1780  purpose but as the means are first put into their hands. Unless the legislatures are sufficiently attentive to this change of circumstances and act in conformity to it every thing must necessarily go wrong or rather must come to a total stop. All that Congress can do in future will be to administer public affairs with prudence, vigor and economy; In order to do which they have sent a Committee to Head Quarters with ample powers in concert with the Commander in chief and the Heads of the departments to reform the various abuses which prevail and to make such arrangements as will best guard against a relapse into them.  The papers inclosed herewith contain all the news we have here. With great regard I am Dr Sir Yr Obt Servt James Madison Jnr ""

  Dear sir, Philada. May 7th [1780]Sunday.  I have the Pleasure to informe your Excellency of the safe arrival of our mutual friend Mr. Jay at Cadiz in 25 days from Martinico, I think it was on the 22d January (a fine Passage indeed). The account came this after noon from Martinico Via St Eustaius in the Active, Capt. Mesnard, in 14 days, (1) And as I was informd this Evening of Mr R Willings going to Morristown tomorrow, was glad of the opportunity to give you the early intelligence.  This day I Receivd a Card from the President of Congress directed to the Delegates of New Jersey, by desire of the Minister of France, that we would attend tomorrow morning at 9 oClock at the Catholic Chapple in this City to Pray (I believe it was to Pray, but as it was French which I do not understand very well I am not sure) for the Repose of the Soul of Mr Merallies. I shall attend and doe the needfull, as he was an old friend of mine at the Havana. The Chevalier used to call the Don, the King of the Segars, I had the Honour of dineing last week with the Chevalier but observed now Don Juan is dead, no Segars were introduc'd, for which reason a certain Person of your acquaintance allways makes his Visites short when that is the Case.  What can be done Sir for Mr John Hopper and his Poor distressed family at Peramus who are totally Ruin'd. I had drawn up the following which I intended to move in Congress, but on shewing it to several Gentlemen they think it will not doe as it would occasion so many applications Viz. Resolvd, That in consideration of the great Loss susstaind by Mr John Hopper of Peramus, in having his Mill, Dwelling house and Effects burnt by the Enemy, in consequence of Major Byles bravely deffending himself in said House, be allowd the Sum of Dollors in Part compensation of said Losse. If your Legislature should not incline to doe something for him Perhaps a Reccomendation from you to Congress would have weight. I am sure Justice requires something to be done and I think I can deppend on your friendly assistance in the Premises. (2) What are your Poor Delegates to doe, for want of money some of your Gentlemen disapprove of our applying here for money, in consequence I have applyd to  MAY 8, 1780  your State Treasurer but without success, as he sent me only a Part, without giving me any reason for his non complyance. My Landlady cannot goe to Market without money and I doe not love to Run in debt for Bread & Water. (A Hint.)  Monday P.M. The Gentleman not goeing out of Town so early as I expected has intirely frusterated my Intention of giving you the first intelligenc. However I hope you will accept the will for the deed, And as the Letter is wrote shall trouble you with the Perusal. I am with great Respect Your Excellencys Most Obedt. Humble Servt.  John Fell ""

  Dear Sir Philadelphia May 8th. 1780 By yesterday's post I had the pleasure of receiving your favor of the 27th. Ulto. (1) The price of Dunlap's paper I understand will be 204 Drs. per annum (2) besides the gratification to the Post which will be not much less. But if there were less objection against the expence, the uncertainty of the conveyance is such that I scarcely think it would be worth your while to become a subscriber. Should that still be your wish however your instructions shall be immediately executed.  Our public affairs still continue in a very confused and critical state owing to the distress of public credit. Nor can they be well put into a better one till the new arrangement of finance and the requisition MAY 8, 1780  of specific supplies are complied with by the States. It appears that this is likely to be done with great decision and energy in the Eastern States. And if Virginia fulfils the expectation and hopes of the public, I flatter myself that however objectionable past[?] measures may be thought we shall in future stand on firmer ground than we have ever done. The terms on which the new money is to be emitted will certainly give it a more substantial and intrinsic value than the old ever had, and the experienced folly of tampering with public credit, will it is to be hoped prevent any mischief to it from that source. Our great danger at present arises from the dilatory proceedings of the States and the real difficulty of drawing forth those resources which the new System is to operate upon. The Treasury and the Army both require immediate relief; and every thing must be in a state of stagnation, to say the lea[s]t, till the contributions of Money & Stores arrive. It is not to be expected that Congress can do any thing further of themselves. The only real power they ever had of supporting the war was that of emitting money on the faith of their Constituents. Their vote for stopping the press was a voluntary relinquishment of that. They are now totally dependent on the supplies from the States. They can not execute a single measure but as the means are first put into their hands. It is absolutely necessary that the States should attend to this change of circumstances and regulate their conduct accordingly. Any further reliance on the (independent) separate resources of Congress will infallibly end in disappointment & ruin.  A Vessel from the West Indies brings information that Mr Gerard & Mr Jay had arrived at Cales [Cadiz?] in 22 days from their leaving Martinique.(3) The English fleet at St. Lucia consists of 22 Ships of the line and a few frigates. They had collected their force at that place in order to make an attempt on Grenada & St. Vincents. But the french reinforcement has stopped that enterprize. The Marquis de Bouille has also strengthened those places with 800 troops sent to one and 600 to the other.  The Enemy at N. York have received late despatches from Europe. But a profound silence is as yet observe[d] with regard to the news in them. An Opinion prevails there that Paul Jones is on the Coast with a small squadron. They say in their papers that the Galatea has been chased by it and that a 74 & some other ships are going out in search of it. The Marquis de la Fayette is arrived at Boston and probably will be here in a few days. (4) His return was not expected and is considered as an omen not unfavorable.  I suppose you must have heard of the death of your friend Don Juan de Miralles. We were this morning on the invitation of [the] Minister of France, at the celebration of the service for the repose of his Soul. He died at Head Quarters whither he attended the Minister on a visit to the Genl & the Army. Every mark of sincere regret  MAY 9, 1780  is visible in all those who were acquainted with him. The lying genius of Rivington has converted his death into that of the Chevalr. de la Luzerne who he says was obliged to fly to the Army for protection against the vengeance of the people. With very sincere esteem & regard I am Dr Sir [Yr.] Obt. & humble Servt  James Madison Jnr.

  My dear General. Philadelphia 9th May 1780.  I Judge of your Excellency's Anxiety for the Fate of Charles Town by my own. When we have much at Stake Events, tho' not very important, are interesting: I shall not therefore fail to give you every Intelligence which comes well authenticated from that Quarter tho' it may probably often happen to be no more than a Repetition of your of ficial Information. The President yesterday receivd dispatches with a Copy of a Letter from Mr Jervais, who is either paymaster or Commissary for the Detatchment of the Army to the Southward, dated the 6t Ultimo; (1) and it appears that our Cavalry under General Huger was surprized by the Enemy & sustaind a Loss of 20 men & 30 Horses: That this Success enabled the Enemy to head Cooper River, and take post on the North side, and that it will eventually compleat the blockade of the Town: That the Injury from their Operations against the Garrison is very inconsiderable; from the Land side having killed only a woman & a child and two Privates of the Virginia Line; & set on Fire three Houses: from the Water they have made no Attack. It is the Letter writer's opinion that if the expected Reinforcement from North Carolina arrives in any Season, the Party of the Enemy posted on the North side of the River- separated as they are from their main body-must fall into our Hands, Mr Lawrence the late President, to whom this Letter is addressed, observes that what Force cannot, Famine may effect. But if the Town, as it is reported, is Supplied with provisions for a Six month's Siege, and the Fire of the Enemy shoud not become much more formidable; the danger of a Reduction seems to be very remote. The account adds-and it gives me pleasure-that Governour Rutledge & five of the Council have been prevailed on to quit the MAY 9, 1 780  Town, in order to support a legal Government in the Country, and enforce Measures for opening and preserving a Communication with the Garrison; and that Mr Gadsden the Lieut Governour with five of the Council remain in the Town. Sir Henry Clinton seems to have put every thing to the hazard in this Enterprize, and from the deliberate Caution of his Motions to bid defiance to the whole power of the Southern States. God grant that he may have Reason to repent his Temerity!  I am much concerned at the Want of money in the military Chest and other Departments: Nothing in our power will be left undone to obtain a competent Supply: but it is to be feared that some distress is necessary to rouse the States to more decisive Exertions. We learn since my last that the new plan of Finance will be supported in Virginia as it already is to the Eastward. This ought to be the Endeavour of every Friend to our Cause. It is unavailing and fruitless to examine into it's policy, or even to exclaim against the Injustice it may do to Individuals. Private opinion and private Interest must give way to publick Councils & the publick Safety; & it ought to be rememberd that in a Case of such difficulty and Embarrasment while some Remedy seemed to be indispensably necessary, none coud have been devised which woud not have been objectable.  The Arrival of a Packet at New York we are informed has produced many dejected Countenances; but as this has been an invariable Remark on every such Event for three years we cannot be much elated. We have however All the Reason to be wished for this Reflection that the Distresses of our Enemies bear a full proportion to our own; and that they cannot but feel the Strongest Apprehensions that the War must terminate in our favour.  I congratulate your Excellency on the Arrival in Europe of Mr Jay & Mr Gerard; & of our Gallant Friend the Marquiss La fayette in America. (2) Mr. Telfare and another Gentleman are just arrived & Col. Walton daily expected, as Delegates from Georgia. (3)  Be pleased to present my most respectful Complements to Mrs Washington, the Gentlemen of the Committee, & of the Family: and to be assured that I am with all possible Esteem, Respect and Attachment, Dear Sir, Your Excellency's very Affectionate & most Obedient Servant,  Jas.

  Sir, Philadelphia May 9t. 178 (1) Your Excellency will probably before the receipt of this have been informed of the death of the honorable Don Juan Demarelles the spanish gentleman of distinction that resided at this place. He died after a short illness the 28th of April at Morristown to which place he had accompanied the Minister of France, to pay their respects to the General & Army. His remains were there interred with the honors of war, and his funeral rites have been also here celebrated this day in the french chappel with very great respect & a lasting requiem sung to his soul.  This Gentleman during his residence here appeared zealously attentive to the political interests & views of this Country as well as his own; & waited with impatience to see the ties between the two countries indissolubly formed by a ratification of treaties of amity & commerce which he expected would take place on the arival of our Minister at the Court of Spain.  Much anxiety prevails here to know the fate of Charlestown, from which there are no accounts, to be depended on, later than the 9th of April, (2) nor does it appear from the papers published in New York to the 3d of this month, that any accounts have been received there later than ours. In addition to the other troops that had been before detached from the main army & sent to General Lincoln, the Delaware regiment & the Maryland line went on a few days agoe, & will arive it is hoped in season to support the country should the enemy be so fortunate as to gain a temporary advantage.  There are very circumstantial accounts from New York, transmitted to General Washington, that Paul Jones is on this Coast with a small squadron of five Ships, & had lately chased some vessels into the Hook, & that a 74 Gun Ship & some Frigats were preparing at New York to go in quest of him. This may be true, it is unknown to Congress where he is.  Several Vessels have arived in this river from St. Eustatia as late as the 23d of April, but bring no material intelligence in addition to what was here before except that the two formidable fleets in the West Indies were both out of port, & that a very busy & important campaign was expected in that quarter.  No official information has been very lately received by Congress MAY 9, 17 80  from Europe; but from the current of publications on that side the water & especially the english papers, it does not appear that any power has yet been found sufficiently uninformed to join Great Britain in her wicked & romantick attempts of reducing to obedience what she yet stiles her rebelious Colonies. And as she cannot obtain assistance she seems willing to have it beleived that she stands in need of none; & accordingly goes on with a shew & pretensions of being sufficient for all things of herself; much perhaps as a merchant sometimes on the eve of bankruptcy makes an uncommon parade of wealth & business in order to keep up the delusion till chance may have had time to atchieve something in his favour. The comparison however fails in this respect that it is no secret to the world that the circumstances of Great Britain are bad, & that the minds of her wisest men are filled with consternation. She is ready to be crushed with the weight of her own debt, which is accumulating upon her by the whole expence of the war, & for which she is already mortgaged to pay forever an annual interest of seven millions sterling. Her revenues being fully charged with the interest it is impossible for her ever to reduce the principal, but by a sponge or revolution; & as impossible for her to go on much farther in borrowing. She is also embarrassed with the claims of oppressed Ireland, & which may perhaps advance upon her as she is less in a condition to contest them. Scotland also tho' habitually servile to the Throne, begins now to speak with determined insolence & will be heard. Add to which, county conventions, in spight of the ministry, are now forming in various parts of England under the first-characters of the Nation, for reducing within due bounds the influence of the crown & the publick expenditures, or which is the same thing, oversetting the present venal & utopian system of administration. From these marks of weakness & dissolution she bears within herself, it is reasonable to expect that Great Britain will e're long cease from troubling us; and unless she can speedily regain the sovereignty of the seas, she may be reduced, from her insular scituation to hold her own existance at the mercy of her enemies. The Use good men in America will derive from these considerations, will be of encouragement to persevere in the present contest, & to continue working with the Lord until by his good pleasure the great business of our political salvation shall be fully accomplished.  It must, I know, be supporting to your Excellency to observe that the State over which you have the honor to preside, are sufficiently impressed with these sentiments already, & do not need additional arguments laid before them to comply with their duty & their interest. Their sense & determination expressed by the general Assembly in their late Sessions at Hartford are a full proof of this, and at the same time exhibit to the world a conviction of the never failing resources a wise & virtuous republick has within itself.  MAY 9, 1780  I thought it my duty to read in Congress the accounts I had received from Connecticut, & was kept in countenance by their just approbation. And it is devoutly to be wished that the well timed & animating example of so respectable a State may have its due influence with the rest. A number of their Assemblies as New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland & Virginia are it is said now convened or convening, & will be informed thro' the channel of the Philadelphia paper, if not otherwise, what Connecticut has done.(3)  I have the honor to be, Sir, with the highest respect, your Excellency's most obedt. humbl. Servant, Oliver Ellsworth  P.S. Since writing the above advice is receivd from Charlestown to the 15 of April 2 oClock P.M. (4) The Enemy had opened their batteries on the town on the 12th & kept them incessantly playing but without much execution. They had surprised a party of the light-Dragoons; Our loss was about 20 men, 30 Horses & 20 waggons with their Horses. The Enemy had also crossed Cooper river & were taking a strong post on the north side of it nearly opposite the town & were endeavouring to complete the Blockade, which unless a reinforcement seasonably arived there was danger of their effecting.

  Sir, Morris Town May 10th. 1780 The necessary enquiries at the posts in the communication from Philadelphia hither, & the heavy rains which fell, retarded ourJourney so much, that we did not reach this place untill the 28th Ulto.  Judging it advisable to inform ourselves, as fully as possible on the general subject of our Mission, before we attempted an alteration in any of the departments, We held conferences with the Commander  MAY 10, 1780  in Chief for several days succeeding our arrival. The result of which, was, that the distressed State of the army, in point of provisions, should claim immediate attention, to the arrangement of the two great staff Departments, so as, to adapt them to securing & bringing on the supplies called for from the several States, by the act of the 25th of February last. Systems for both have been attempted, & some progress made therein. We find little difficulty in establishing one for receiving, securing, issuing, & properly accounting for, the expenditure of supplies to be furnished by the states. But, embarrassments of a serious nature arose, through a want of money on the one hand, to pay for the transportation thereof, a want of forage on the other, in those States which are not called on to furnish any, & in which the Continental officers are probably inhibited from purchasing, as they are in this State, & where the quota of that article, is already expended, at the same time, that the State Officers cannot go beyond the quantities assigned them. And yet, a vast land transportation must of necessity take place, in & through States, under either predicament. The impracticability of conveying Forage from States remotely situated is too evident to require any comments on our parts. Hence, unless the States are requested to repeal so much of their laws as prohibit the Continental Officers from making purchases, whenever Congress, or some superintending board, or Military Commander, shall judge it necessary, the public service must inevitably be retarded, if not totally stagnated. Nor, should the repeal be confined, to a mere permission for procuring forage, but, be extended to every enumerated article under the restrictions mentioned. For it is beyond a doubt that cases will arise, in which the army will be resupplied in particular States, when the quotas of such States have been expended, And those of others not only so remote, as to afford little prospect of immediate relief, but, too much so, to draw the supplies from thence, on any principle of economy, if they could be got at hand, as the mere charge of transportation, would greatly exceed the prime cost. But the repeals We have stated to be necessary, are not alone sufficient, for unless money is immediately furnished to pay for the transportation of supplies from the different magazines in hired carriages, & to redeem the public working cattle which the farmers in every quarter hold in pledge for the payment of their subsistence through the winter every plan of supply must prove nugatory, & all we have done, or can do, relative to the arrangement of those departments, will be inadequate to the great object. Indeed such are the accumulated distresses of the army at this conjuncture, & such the effects of a repetition of want, that it has had a very pernicious influence on the soldiery. Their patience is exhausted, by being exposed to such frequent sufferings, that they already begin to ascribe to a defect of resources, what they have hitherto been taught to believe arose from accidental impediment.  Their starving condition, Their want of pay, & the variety of hardships they have ben driven to sustain, has soured their tempers, & produced a spirit of discontent which begins to display itself under a complexion of the most alarming hue. If this spirit should fully establish itself, it must be productive of some violent convultion, infinitely to our prejudice at home, & abroad, as it would evince a want of means, or a want of wisdom to apply them. Either of which must bring our cause into discredit & draw in its train, consequences of a nature too serious to be contemplated without the deepest anxiety. Permit us therefore to intreat the immediate attention of Congress to this necessary supply, for the purpose we have mentioned. And, for the payment of the troops, to whom the Paymaster is now greatly in arrears, and the Officers so entirely destitute, that many for want of their subsistance money, with which they made some addition to their single rations, are now reduced to the disagreeable necessity of making it their whole support.  On examining into the State of provisions in Camp we find there is not more meat than will last untill the 12th Inst. Collo. Blane is come up, & we learn from him that he has no prospect of an immediate supply of this article. The only resource we can turn our eyes to, in this exigency is, the State of Pensylvania. If they fail to make instantaneous exertions for the relief of the army-We will not pretend to say, what may be the event!  Before we had an opportunity closely to view and examine into the real State of things, we had no conception of the almost inextricable difficulties, in which we found them involved.  We have stated matters plainly. We have been impelled to it by every consideration of duty, by the sincere desire we have to fulfill the views & expectations of Congress, in our appointment, And by the principles of unbounded affection for our Country. These will lead us to every exertion And without a moments delay to lop of[f] every exuberancy which can be effected without material injury.  We have omitted observing that the Medical department are destitute of those necessaries, which are indispensable for the sick. They have neither wine, Tea, sugar, Coffee, Chocolate, or spirits. We wish orders may be given for an immediate supply, as the army grow more sickly every hour.  Inclosed is a Copy of a letter from the Commissaries Genl. of purchases, & Issues, to the Commander in Chief. (1)  We have the Honour to be, sir, with the highest Respect Yr most Obedt. Servts.

  My dear Friend Philad. 12th May 1780 I need not tell you that I was much disappointed in not meeting with you at Camp. (1) Besides the pleasure of your Conversation I had in view to consult you on business. I am now launcd forth without the Advantage of your late Observations and Experience on the Floor, and must trust to my little Stock. There are two Points which I have much at Heart and which will fall within the powers of your present important Mission. It is reported that a Quantity of Cloathing is arrived or expected from France: (2) you will see I feel the distressed Circumstances of our State Line. Let those worthy Men be provided for, as they are peculiarly destitute: and I have but feeble Hopes that any Measures in the power of our State will afford them seasonable Relief. My Feelings for them were painfully touched at a late Review. I did not indeed want such a Proof of their distress: Nor can you want arguments to awaken your Attention.  The other point requires some Investigation before there will be use in communicating it, which I this moment recollect.  Thus far I had written when I was honourd with your Favour of the 6t. (3) I agree with you that the Detention of the party to the Senecas Country affords no prospect of the Success of their Visit. I never apprehended matters were sufficiently ripend for a peace with the Six nations. Present good is their only motive to any Action; & our Enemies have the means of gratifying them. Our Friend Col. Louis' (4) Remark to me upon this very Subject will be Justified. In substance it was this: The Six nations are fools-they will forget the Loss of their Country in contemplating the Bawbles & Trinkets bestowd upon them by the british Agents. The Oneidas claim our Protection and  MAY 12, 1780  our Promise of a Residence. As far as I can Judge the Upper Castle will be the most proper. It will be a great discouragement to the Western frontiers if they are drawn down to Fort Hunter & have the Apperance of abandoning the whole county of Tryon as too insecure for the Residence of even the Indians. How far there is the necessary Soil or Accommodation for these our distressed friends at the upper Castle, Or whether they will be contented with such an Assignment I cannot decide.  The Marquiss La fayette I presume is with you before this day. From Hints we may expect essential Support from our great Ally in the present Campaign. When we have more authentic Advice it will be worth communicating: but you may perhaps have speedier Information thro' the Marquiss.(5)  We have nothing from Charles Town since my last Letter to General Washington. (6)  I am pleasd to hear of Mrs. Schuyler's Intention to visit us: Among other Reasons that we shall have the pleasure & advantages of your Company & Council.  Your Publick Letter (7) is referred to a Committee And nothing will be left undone to excite this Government to exert herself for the supply of the Army.  Adieu my dear Sir and believe me always, your affectionate & most Obedient Servt, Jas. Duane  P.S. Present my respectful Compliments to the General, the Gentlemen of the Committee & of the family.

  Dear Colonel Philadelphia May [12] 1780 (1) Yesterday a Letter from Mr. Carmichael dated in Feby at Madrid & inclosing Copies of two Letters from him to Mr. Jay at Cadiz, was received by Congress,(2) & the Gentleman who decyphered the latter informs me this Morning that they contain Advices of an annual Loan of three Million Livres, which the Court of France have agreed to supply to Congress during the War, & also of a Squadron of french Ships with a body of land Forces to operate in America; the latter I hope will be soon on the Coast, & employed to releive Charlestown. The Letters further say that Don Juan was instructed by the Court of Spain to make proposals to Congress for taking into Pay a Body of American Troops for the Reduction of the Floridas, but as Congress will probably send a Copy of the Letters to the General & it is expected that the Marques La Fayette is at Camp, You will undoubtedly be informed of the particulars. The Board of Treasury have issued Warrants on the Treasurer & at the same Time sent him private Instructions not to pay them: perceiving this, I applyed to them for an order to discharge your Warrant & another in favor of myself, but without Success. I shall return my Warrant & have it cancelled, but I think you may obtain the payment of yours by writing a Line to Congress & informing them that the Money is wanted here to discharge the Bills for Supplies procured for the Committee, in  MAY 12, 1780  doing which You were under the Necessity of advancing Your own Money.

  Sir Philada. 12 May 1780 I take the Liberty to enclose to your Excellency for the Inspection of the Legislature, Copy of an Act of the General Assembly of the State of Connecticut for carrying into Execution the Recommendation of Congress contained in their Proceedings of 18th March last on the Subject of Finance, (1) marked No 1 and Extract of a Letter from a Member of Congress for the State of Massachusetts bay, lately MAY 12, 1780  returned into that State, on the same Subject. (2) The Advices from other States speak a similar Language, as far as any Thing on the Subject has come to my Knowledge. The principal Objections to the Execution of this Plan are made in Pennsylvania, it is said, or rather in Philadelphia, for I believe the state in General are in Sentiment with it and good reason they have to be so; for it is no longer uncertain that in many Places to the Eastward, the Exchange between Paper and Specie was on the 18th of March at or below fourty, while in Pennsylvania it was sixty. But I have observed more than once that the Citizens here are apter to find Fault than they are to produce a good reason for doing it: the most sensible however do not gainsay.  I have formerly written pretty fully on this Subject to the Legislature, (3) and only add, at this Time, that I believe a full adoption and steady adherence to the System will be attended with beneficial Effects. I ever did think it unexceptionable, but when I have seen Persons, who found most Fault with it, put upon shewing one preferable, I must confess it has not been done, and in the most Cases has not been attempted. It is universally acknowledged that Something decisive in the Matter of Finance is become indispensible, and it is a sound Maxim that in financing it is better to adhere uniformly to a Plan if it is not the best, and more good will be produced by it, than to unsettle and alter from Time to Time even if it is in some respects for the better. From all I have hitherto learned, I am inclined to think it will be agreeable to the People in general. Many it is to be confessed will suffer, but upon strict Investigation it will appear, that the Number is not so great as would at first be apprehended. Let it be considered we are in an unfortunate Predicament; let any Mode whatever be taken, many must suffer, I believe as few, if not fewer, in this way than any other.  It is with great regret I am constrained to mention that it has not been in the Power of the Delegates to procure any Means of answering the numerous Claims made upon the publick Departments by the Inhabitants of New Jersey. I hope it will be believed, for it is a Fact, that Congress, fully sensible of the Exertions and sufferings of the State, are forwardly disposed to do every Thing in their Power, but the Resources in Command are greatly inadequate. The present Operations of the War to the Southward, much more expensive than similar operations would be in any of these States, swallow up every Thing. Reluctant as I am to think of receiving the Certificates given in the Comissary's and Quarter Master's Departments in Taxes, I begin to think it will be impossible to avoid it. An additional Reason makes it more disagreeable than formerly, these Debts will swallow up the Taxes and the plenary Execution of the Plan of Finance will perhaps be postponed by it. I sent to the Legislature at the last Sitting a Copy of the Act of Assembly of the State of New York upon this Subject, that if it should be taken up a Precedent and Example might   be at Hand. I do not think however the Legislature will suffer this Matter, if they do adopt it, to interfere with the Scheme of Finance, for I am of Opinion that if an Option is given to the People to bring in the Continental Money and have it exchanged, they will voluntarily do it in many Cases, and this may in some Measure make up for the Deficiency of Money in Taxes. And should the whole Quota thus come in, the Taxes can still go on paid in Certificates or new Bills a fourtieth Part, or Specie if any one chuses. The Representation and remonstrance from the State to Congress stands referred to the Board of Treasury and no Means will be left unessayed to endeavour to do Something towards discharging these Debts, but it is impossible to say with any Certainty what can be done. If any of them could be paid in Loan Office Certificates, they might be had as the whole Loan is not yet filled, though not a very large Sum remains.  Enclosed also is a Copy of the famous Virginia Land Office Act, (4) which has been so offensive to Several of the States and which they have in some Measure suspended on the recommendation of Congress. I have only to observe at present that from the laudable Example which has been lately set by the State of New York,(5) I have some Hopes Virginia will also show a Disposition to bound herself within a reasonable Extent leaving a large and extensive Country the Property of the Union.  I am, with great Respect, Your Excellency's obedt. Servant. William Ch Houston  ""

  Sir Philadelphia May 12th. 1780 I did myself the Honor of writing to You some time since, of a date I do not now recollect, (1) as I had not Time to retain a Copy of the Letter. But it was so long ago that I have some Apprehension from not having been favored with your Answer, that either it or your Answer may have miscarried, which probably may also be the Case with the joint Letter from the Delegates which they had the Honor to write to You before.(2) In short except what has been handed to Us by official Information, I, for my own part, have not recd. a MAY 12, 1780  Syllable of Information from any Gentleman in public Office in our State since my Arrival in this City.  The full Adoption of the plan of Finance by all the States is eagerly expected By Congress. Connecticut has actually complied & transmitted their Law on that Subject, as well as another concerning specific Supplies for the Army, to Congress; and we have abundant Evidence with respect to both, that the landed and trading Interest of that State will heartily conspire to give them the most vigorous Execution. We have the most flattering Assurances of a like Spirit operating in the Massachusets Bay, and from these Considerations we hope that all New England will unite to carry both into full Effect. With respect to our State, its delegates, well & long convinced of the Zeal of our Legislature, which indeed is as well known & acknowledged by Congress & the Army, in the Common Cause, cannot entertain the least doubt that our State will exert itself in an effectual Compliance with both plans.  With respect to that on Finance, delicate as the Subject is, I conceive it too plain to require much Comment. I trust it will be sufficient to observe in general, that the plan turns upon this general principle, to wit; That the depreciation of our former Emissions moderately supposed on an Avarage at 40 for one, tho' in Exchange, at some places at 60 for one, & in purchases from 80 to 120 for one, rendered absolutely necessary a Call by Congress for a forty fold nominal Tax on the united States, at the least, in former Emissions, or in Specie, or the intended to be funded Emission at par. Congress therefore most clearly have not broke faith with the public. This Argument is equally applicable to both plans. If there is a Breach of Faith, the people at large have by depreciation broke faith with themselves. Congress have carefully avoided intermeddling with the Circulation of the old Medium in private Commerce, have not recommended even the compelling the payment of Taxes in it; but on the contrary have so framed their plan as to leave it at the Option of every Individual to pay his Taxes in it, in Specie, or in the new Emission. Nor have they meddled with the possible Surplus that may possibly remain on hand after the monthly Taxes shall have been brought in. By leaving this part of the Subject undefined, they leave every Man at full Liberty to speculate for himself. This Speculation in the dark, tho' it leaves him at perfect Liberty, with respect to one of the three Modes of paying in his Taxes, will probably have the wished for Effect of bringing in all the old Emissions.  Thus much as to the general principle upon which the plan of Finance is built. That on specific Supplies stands on the same principle, a Call on the States to furnish them without Regard to the Increase of prices, or what is tantamount the depreciation. With respect to the Avaraged rate of forty to one, an Avarage for obvious Reasons was necessary. By it some States will be gainers, other losers,  MAY 13, 1780 7  but this could not be avoided. The apparent Excellence and Necessity of this plan, which has already become the subject of Rage & disappointment to the Enemy, & however much it may be publickly reprobated & privately opposed by Speculators, will I am confident be eagerly embraced by the Wisdom of our Legislature. And I am sorry that my present public Engagement, forbids my bearing my Testimony in its Favor in my place in Senate. I had like to have forgot that the plan, together with the Resolution of Congress' for succoring the Army from the pernicious Effects of depreciation, has made that most distinguishedly virtuous part of the Community happy at least in prospect.  With respect to the Mode of funding the Quotas of the new Emission, I suppose different Modes will be adopted by the different States, suited to their different Circumstances. Some have not Common & perhaps no forfeited unappropriated Lands, and therefore will necessarily be driven to fund on Taxes appropriated & sufficiently productive-others, as we, may fund on both & make both Funds mutually subservient to the Alleviation and Security of each other. But this is a Subject that would require a larger Field for discussion than the Limits even of a long Letter will admit of. And tho' I would readily contribute my Mite on so important a Topic; yet I chearfully submit the Subject to the mature Consideration of the Legislature.  Should the plan take effect You will easily see, Sir, the Necessity of a tender Law. I have hastily drawn one this Morning. If I should have Time to make a fair Copy of it I will, which or the Draft shall be inclosed. You will remark it goes only to old Debts; and I think the Reasons are obvious why it should go no farther. That and this Letter You may communicate to the Members of the Legislature if You please. To all of whom permit Me to trouble You with my Compliments. I Sincerely wish their present Meeting will be attended with lasting good Effects. We have nothing lately from S.C. We think this a favorable Circumstance, notwithstanding the close Investiture of the Town. Nothing yet done about the Grants for want of a sufficient Number of disinterested States. That Impediment removed not a Moment shall be lost. I am, with the greatest respect, Your Excellency's most obediant Servant, Jno. Morin Scott  ""

  Sir, Philada. 13 May 1780 The Letter of the 10th inst from your Committee was read in Congress yesterday and referred. The Committee of whom I am one, was instructed, in the first Place, to confer with the President and Council of Pennsylvania; and we have this morning been discharging that Part of our Duty.(1) We have laid before them such Extracts of your letter as seemed most proper, and explained fully and urged pressingly the Objects of it as far as they concerned the State particularly. They have given us the most unreserved Assurances of their forward Exertions, but withal express great Doubts whether they will be effectual. The State, we are told, raises very little Beef, which is the Article to which, at present, you particularly point, and of this Letter, scarcely any is in any Sort of Preparation for Use. They have ordered out People to examine the Meadows and Farms round the City and in the adjacent Country. From thence if any Supply is derived, it will be more immediate than from the Counties mentioned by the Comissaries General in your Enclosure of the 9th, which will also we hope be next resorted to. The Want of Money is a great Obstacle, what they have been able to command having been required for other Purposes, and you will remember that Beef is not one of the Articles which they are to furnish by the requisition of the 25th of February last. They also mention, and with too much Justice, the vast Consumption of Provision and Forage in the State by Persons who are, or pretend to be, entitled to them as being in the publick Service. When I consider the Facts and Explanations which they state upon this Subject, and extend them even in a small Degree to the other States in the Union, I am constrained to say, what is every Day present to my Mind, that unless we can  MAY 13, 1780  alter and reform the modes of conducting the civil Departments of the Army, the Soldiery must separate or starve. You have not been so much in Congress lately as the other Gentlemen who are joined with you in Comission; they will witness that I have urgently and uniformly pressed this Consideration; and I now declare, and the Event will shew it, that there can be no Alternative, no Compromise, Persons in the Staff Departments, except in Cases where they are in Camp, and all those who are employed at different Places throughout the Country, must, where it is requisite and reasonable, have a proper Increase of Pay, and go to Market, to the Farmers or board for their Subsistence, and the Army have the Provisions, or the former use them and the latter go without. This Matter never can, it never will be regulated by Halves. I have now sat six Months at the Treasury Board, and am not without some little Knowledge of our Finances and Resources. It is not impossible to find Money to support and prosecute the War on a Plan of wages or Contracts, but the United States at vendue would scarcely suffice to keep us moving on the Plans we have for two years past pursued. The Resources of no Country whatever are adequate to it. It is not worth while to struggle with Impossibilities, in which we must, in the Issue, both fail and be ruined into the Bargain. Including the Debts which we are told remain to be satisfied, upwards of two Hundred Millions are less than the Expenditures of the Departments of the Quarter Master and Commissary Generals for the two past years. Is Half this Sum a high Calculation for Provisions and Forage? The Truth is we have, comparatively speaking fed one Half of the Country and their Horses, and they wanton in Plenty though the Army should be pinched to the last Extremes of Distress; and this is the more mortifying as many of those who thus forestal the Soldiers of a Morsel of Bread, have the Reputation among the People in general of being some of the m[ost] useless and worthless of the Sons of Men.  Is it not possible to discontinue the Issues of rations altogether and of every Kind, except in Camp, under which I comprehend ali Detachments of the Army, all Posts where Men of Arms are, Garrisons and Guards. Even if Waggoners, Boatmen and Persons daily attending in the Hospitals were included, we should not still be devoured as we now are. I do not pretend to be fully acquainted with the different Descriptions of Service where Subsistence is impracticable otherwise than from the publick Stores; but I see Rations issued to great Numbers of People who could, without the least Difficulty, supply themselves, and who could procure them at one Half the Price it costs the Publick to furnish them, computing all Expenses. We know that vast Quantities of Provisions and Forage have been and are purchased for the Army, but by the Issues to the Staff and it's endless appendages, they are dissipated and absorbed. Certainly it would be better to give such People, where they are necessary, any  advantages of Contract, or any Wages which Conscience or Custom would admit them to take, than feed them at the Expense of the Existence of the Army.  I observe that the Commissaries General in their Letter, or report, of the 9th inst to the Comander in Chief (2) mention a military Force as the most possible, if not the only means of producing a present Supply. The remark is just, and it may be that the Matter must issue here. The reflection which strikes me, is the shameful and untoward Appearance of the Thing; to take Provisions and Forage from the Inhabitants by military Contribution, not merely for the Army, this every good Citizen would approve where requisite, but for Persons whom we see at Home, some doing little, some Nothing, many their own private Business, and all of whom could be otherwise subsisted than from the publick Stores, these Things create a general Discontent among the People, totally discourage them from Industry and Exertion, and indeed the Absurdity and oppression of such Arrangements admit of no Excuse or Palliation. When His Excellency lately made a requisition to New Jersey, it was fully furnished, even to the Impoverishment of the State. Necessity, the Affection and respect of the People for their General, the Deserving and the Wants of the army conspired to forward it: but I did not converse with a single thinking Man who failed to make the remarks above stated, I did not receive a Letter in which they were not detailed. The People have not Ingenuity enough to discover why the Army should be starved that it's appendages may be fed; and indeed I believe we are the only Nation under Heaven who do these Things: I cannot recollect, nor have I ever heard that such was the Case when we formerly supported an Army in America.  In the Course of our Conference with the Council we have been led to learn that they have purchased and supplied a considerable Quantity of their Quota of Hay, and I am of Opinion the whole will be consumed without a Handful reaching the Army. Perhaps indeed it is too distant; but if I am not mistaken Supplies of this Article have heretofore gone up the Delaware from below this Town, and if they did not proceed to Morriston they furnished the Communication. I cannot learn that such has been the Case in the present Instance. That Part of the Letter from your Committee which respects Forage will be duly attended to, nor will there be much Inconvenience in an Addition to the Quota of Supplies required from any particular State when Circumstances require it; or in taking more of any one Article than the Quantity expressed in the requisition, in Lieu of a proportionate Quantity of another according to the stipulated Prices. Our Appointment leads us also to a Conference with the Assembly of Pennsylvania as soon as they make a House, and we shall report to Congress on the several Things you mention.  I cannot close this Letter with adverting to a further Reason which  increases my Anxiety about the main Subject of it. It has long been Matter of Speculation and Enquiry whether we might not in the Course of the coming Summer expect Succours on the Coast from abroad. The Possibility of this desirable Event makes the Subject of Supplies still more interesting. And when we consider our present Situation and that we have not the most flattering Prospects of Plenty the present Year it is certainly a Point of wisdom to save every Ounce that can be saved. Every Person supplied from the publick Stores consumes double the Quantity he would otherwise.  Your Letter mentions the distressed State of the Hospitals for Want of proper Stores. It is painful to say, I cannot be surprised at it. The prodigious numbers of idle Officers in that Department is a publick Scandal. There is, I am told no Hospital here, nor within twenty miles of the Town, and yet, I suppose, there are not less than a Score of Hospital Officers who doubtless are entitled to whatever they wish to draw from the Purveyour's Stores, as well as ordinary Rations. You must remember the Return made here last Winter before the Hospital was moved, when there were 50 Hospital officers and 133 Patients. It is not a Trifle will supply the Officers here, as many of them are high in Office, though I cannot hear of any Thing they do-and it is to be supposed the same Circumstances exist in other Places.  I have written my Sentiments freely to you, not officially as one of the Committee or on their Behalf. I suppose when they have expedited the Business you will hear from them. Your Committee, in my Apprehension, have Power to redress the Mischiefs to which I have pointed as far as they are redressible, by a proper Order for the Purpose. Difficulties will arise at first, but a little Resolution and Perseverance will reconcile them. We may as well be embarrassed in one Way as another.  15th. No Conveyance having offerred, I am unhappy this Morning to inform you of an Accident which happened yesterday to Mr. Gouverneur Morris. He was riding out in a Phaeton, and the Horses taking a Fright ran away in the Street, struck the Carriage against a Post, broke it all to Pieces and in the Shock fractured Mr. Morris's Ancle to such a Degree that it became necessary to take off his Leg imediately.

  Dear Sir, Morris town May 13t 1780 The Marquis De La Fayette is so good as to take Charge of this; he will announce to Congress (If the dispatches he has forwarded from hence have not allready done It) the Glorious exertion of the King his Master In our favor.(1) The Ample Succour that prince has sent, the terms on which, the Extensive power given us to direct the force of our Illustrious Ally, all combine to evince the most determined resolution In France effectually to Support us. But my Dear Sir what must be the feelings of this Generous Ally, what the reflections of every Observant power In Europe, If we do not Improve this Succour to the advantages It is capable of, If we do not In some quarter make such an Impression on the Enemy as to give impretion at home and abroad that Britain must of necessity relinquish the Contest, will It not too evidently Evince that we want the means of Exertion, or the wisdom to apply those Means. I think It will, and that our cause will be materially Injured and that of the enemy promoted. We shall lose friends, they will gain them. If these reflections have any weight It is Incumbent on us to Strain every nerve for a Spirited Co-operation, the Country is far, very far, from being destitute of the necessary Supplies, the means to draw them forth are also within our reach, but not In the ordinary way. If we trust to that, we shall Inevitably lose an Opportunity which may never again offer, and the reflections on which will most assuredly destroy the happiness of our lives, extraordinary Cases require Extraordinary remedies and exertions. A degree of Inertia pervades all popular bodies, they are unequal to that Celerity so requisite to the Effectual prosecution of Military Operations. Perhaps Congress labours In a greater degree under this misfortune than any popular body that ever existed at the head of an Empire, by Invariably holding up to the States that It had only a Recommendatory power, they have been taught to pay little attention to any decision of Congress, but It is for the weal of the Empire that they should resume, or even take new powers. The present Occasion will Justify It, and I most sincerely wish they may not lose the opportunity. A little reflection must convince every one that the more speedily (after the Arrival of the French force) we begin to operate, the Greater will be the prospect of Suc- MAY 14, 1780  cess. To allow six weeks from this, for that arrival is giving Competent time. In that Six weeks how much is to be done, what a variety of necessarys to be procured, what force to be purchased. Indeed my friend so much must be done that Congress cannot In time make even the necessary resolutions unless they reduce them to one, which shall lodge dictatorial powers either In the Commander In Chief, or In him, Conjointly with a Small Committee of Congress.(2) Should the latter be adopted It will be necessary to Chuse men of Abilities and Consideration, but as that Cannot always be done and that there is a necessity of temporizing, would It not be well to put Elsworth on It, as so many Supplies must be drawn from and thro the state he represents;-I wish one of you to be another, and If possible Jones from Virginia, a third.  When Sir Harry Clinton receives the Account of the french Force coming to America he will In all probability raise the Siege of Charles Town If he has not taken It, In order to Concentre his force at N York or at any other point against which he may suppose our operations will be directed. He will do the Same If Charles Town is taken, only leaving a Garrison there. In either case It appears unnecessary that the Maryland troops Should prosecute their march to South Carolina as their Services will be lost, would It not therefore be well to hasten them back to this Quarter?  America is much Indebted to the Marquis for his exertions In Its favor. I hope Congress will feel It, and hasten that reward so pleasing to a Sensible mind.

  Dear Sir, Morris Town, May 1 5th 1780.  The Marquis de la Fayette, of whose arrival your Excellency has doubtless been Informed, left us yesterday with dispatches from the Court of Versailles for Congress, and for the Chevalier De La Luz- MAY 15, 1780  erne; whilst here the Marquis detailed the Contents of the dispatches, of which he was fully advised, to a select few. They evince the most decided determination on the part of France to Support us thro the Contest, and an event will soon take place which will announce to all Europe and America that his most Christian Majesty will not confine himself to mere professions of amity to us or to pecuniary aids.  I am not at present permitted to be more explicit;(1) but a common friend of ours (2) has wished me to Communicate thus much, with the Express view that the legislature may not seperate until they hear from Congress on the Subject I have alluded to. If, therefore, there should be a disposition to a speedy close of the session, it may perhaps be proper to signify that I consider it a duty incumbent on me as their servant in Congress, to intreat the legislature may not nise, as there will most assuredly be a necessity of reconvening them at an early day.  Mr. Livingston has been here and proposed to do himself the honor to wait on the legislature, but was prevailed on, to return to Congress to afford his aid on the important business which will immediately claim the attention of that body; (3) he has intreated me to mention this to your Excellency that the legislature may be advised of it; altho I am closely engaged with the committee appointed to the arrangment of the Staff departments. Yet if your Excellency and the legislature shall deem my presence necessary at Kingston for the purpose of giving any information they may require, I shall with great alacrity attend. I am, Dear Sir, with every sentiment of Esteem & affection your Excellency's most obedient Humble Servant,  Ph: Schuyler.  [P.S.] Charlestown safe on the 1st Instant; little Impression made by the Enemy. If it is not reduced before this day, there are reasons to believe it will not be at all.

  Dear Sir Morris town May 15th 1780 In the letter which I did myself the pleasure to adress you by the MAY 15, 1780  Marquis, I mentioned the necessity of remanding the Troops lately order'd to South Carolina under General De Kalb;(1) I have since submitted my reasoning on the subject to the General (2) and he is perfectly In sentiment with me on the propriety of It, altho he does not chuse to request It of Congress as they were ordered thither by that body. It is however possible that Gentlemen may differ in opinion with us on the subject unless the reasons which appear to militate in favor of the recall occur to them or are detailed. I shall therefore take the Liberty to adduce them to you.  If Charles town should be In possession of the Enemy, when Sir Harry Clinton receives advise of the Intended reinforcement from France, he will probably Immediately Embark for New York, in order If possible to save that place, which he will have a good chance of doing. If he concenters his force there, leaving the smallest Garrison possible for the defence of Charles town, In this case the Militia of the Country will suffice to protect the rest of the state, and more they cannot do, If even Joined by De Kalb for no force whatever can recover the town, until cannons, and every requisite for a Siege, can be procured, and such a supply they cannot expect this season from us. But should the town not be reduced when the Account of the French reinforcement arrives, and should Sir Harry persevere, not only to reduce the town, but having done that, to attempt a Conquest of the Intire State (which by the by would be a kind of madness we should think him Incapable of) the reinforcements under De Kalb will not be able to prevent him and therefore ought not to be lost between the two points, which I apprehend they will be If they proceed and be lost to both.  But should Sir Harry, on being advised of the Intended French reinforcement raise the Seige, and return to New York for the defence of that port, then General Lincoln will be safe, and In sufficient force to dislodge the Enemy from Georgia should any be left there, hence then There will be no necessity for De Kalbs proceeding, on the Contrary, It will be evidently necessary that the force under Gen. Washington should be Increased as much as possible to afford a probable prospect of Success, against an Enemy in such Capital force as the British will be at New York when Joined by the troops from Carolina; If our operations should be formed against that City; thus in every point of view It seems necessary that De Kalb should be recalled, at least to Cheasapeak Bay, from whence If Sir Harry should remain In Carolina and our operations be directed to that Quarter, they may be Conveyed thither In the fleet, & If against New York they will be at hand to Join this Army.  As It seems Impossible to draw forth the necessary supplies On the present Occasion In the ordinary way, and that no alternative offers but by applying to the States to support your officers, would It not be proper, to request the legislatures now Convened to con- MAY 16, 1780  tinue sittings, and to request those that are not assembled to do so, without delay, that such applications as Congress may deem necessary to make may be laid before them and their decision obtained the soonest possible?  Adieu my friend, remember that much is to be done and very little time allowed us to do It in.  I am affectionately and Sincerely Yours &c &c,  Ph. Schuyler [P.S.] In the Committees letter of the 10th Instant to Congress, a Glance was thrown against the System of State Supplies. I wished to have attacked It in force, to have Induced Congress to a reconsideration of the Subject, persuaded that If some attention was bestowed on It, and If reduced to Calculation, It would be found productive of an expence far, very far beyond what a well directed purchasing System would Induce, and after all the Supplies would never be Collected In greater quantities under that System than barely to Support the army from day to day.(3) It is late and Mr Mathews goes of early in the morning (4) otherwise I would enter into a minute State of the Objections the new System is liable to, and evince by Calculation that its expence will be enormous.

  Sir Morristown May 16th. 1780 Agreable to the Instructions of Congress the Committee has con- MAY 16, 1780  sulted the Commander in chief about the propriety of reducing the number of Regiments, and in conjunction with his Excellency fully discussed the matter, Considered It under a variety of views and Concluded that no Capital reduction could be adopted without hazard at this Conjuncture for altho a very Considerable diminution of the public expence would attend a reduction even If the Officers retired on full pay during the war, and were to participate in every advantage And Emolument after It with those remaining in Actual Service; And Altho a variety of Embarrasment In the formation of the Division, Brigades &c &c and in the disipline of the Army result from the paucity of the numbers which Compose the Several Corps; Yet reasons exist which forcibly militate against the reduction and which arise from the following facts-The certainty that the Campaign will be opened, and the Army take the field, before the necessary arrangements Incident on a reduction can possibly be Effected-The particular Conjuncture of the day-The aversion which the Soldiery in general entertain to a change of Officers- The personal Attachments which Induced many to Engage In the service during the war or which has been acquired since they have been In It-The necessity of Attending to, and temporizing with the feelings of Men whose virture is put to the Severest tryal by the distresses they experience from a Combination of Almost every specie of hardship; A Consideration of these facts has led the Committee to determine not to Attempt a present reduction of more than the 5th New York, and She[r]burns and Livingstons Regiments, and we do ourselves the honor to Inclose Your Excellency Copy of our resolutions, for the reduction of these Corps.(1) it appears Improper to publish them here until Congress has decided on what terms the reduced officers are to retire from the service which decision we Intreat to be favored with as soon as may be.  In considering the Subject we have Stated It became necessary to Examine Minutely the returns of the Army In detail And we have the mortification to Observe that some Companies are reduced to four rank and file-That a Majority of the Residue do not exceed fifteen-That the number of recruits which have Joined towards compleating the quotas called for by the act of Congress of the 9th February last are very Inconsiderable Indeed-That Should the deficiencies called for by that act be furnished the army would Still be much weaker than It was Intended to be at that time, as many have been discharged and great disertions have taken place Since-That some states appear to have considered as part of their quota Citizens employed In the various Staff departments of the Army, and who were never engaged either as soldiers or Even as regimented or Inlisted artificers During the war-That from Information which the Committee has Obtained, It appears the mode adopted by several of the States, perhaps by all, to Comply with the requisition of Con-  gress of the 9th of February last, does not afford the most distant prospect that the Army will be reinforced with one quarter part of the Compliment deficient, and In all probability not even with that Small portion until towards the End of the Campaign. As from this state of facts the necesity of Immediate measures for a Speedy and Effectual augmentation of the army appears evident, the Committee conceived It a duty, especially engaged as the Attention of Congress now is with other very Interesting and Important Matter, that the deficiency In Each line of the Army should be stated In a return, which with such remarks as seemed requisite, we have the honor to Inclose; (2) And that we should take the liberty to propose to Congress a set of resolutions (3) Calculated to draw from the States a Temporary supply of men to Compleat the Establishment proposed in February last, As Inlistments or drafts for the War, cannot possibly take place with Sufficient Celerity to be of any Service in the Operations of the present Campaign, And that It would be hazarding too much to rely altogether on aids from the Militia, as experience has evinced It too precarious a dependance especially for offensive operations in as much as they frequently retire from the field in such Critical Conjunctures & when their Continuance would be of the highest Importance.(4)  We have the honor to be with Great respect, Your Excellency's Most Obedient, Humble Servants, Ph.

Resolved that the Regiments now Commanded by Colonel James Livingston, and by Colo.

All which is Humbly Submitted by, Ph.

Resolved that the states be severally required to Compleat said quotas by drafts from the Militia to Serve in the Continental Army until the last day of December next Inclusive unless sooner discharged, On the Estimates of deficiency transmitted them by the Commander in chief.  Resolved that the Commander in chief transmit to the executive of the states respectively, returns of all additional deficiencies which have arisen from Casualties since the Estimates mentioned In the preceeding resolution.  Resolved that so much of such additional deficiency as is occasioned by death, desertion or discharge of men who were engaged to Serve beyond the last day of September next, or during the war; be made good by the States in the Manner directed by the Second resolution.

The Court of London hath earnestly applied to the Court of Russia for assistance, and was absolutely refused. A hearty friendship subsists between the latter and the Court of France. The Dutch entertain more favorable sentiments of us than formerly, the Stadtholder, who hath been against us, acknowledged he hath been deceived, and is for furnishing unlimited convoys to their trade. Ireland is not satisfied. Scotland is uneasy at the countenance given to the roman MAY 16, 1780  catholic religion. Associations and Committees of Correspondence those terrible engines to despots have alarmed the ministry of Great Britain. France seems determined to preserve a decided naval superiority over the British in the American Seas. More ships and troops are coming out; and perhaps some of them may come to our immediate assistance. The success of the british fleet off Gibraltar hath flushed the spirits of our enemies, but not at all disheartned the Spaniard. Capt. Jones in the Alliance is order'd to America. The three ships she captured, and which were obliged to put into Denmark have been order'd by its King to be deliver'd up to the British Consul against this conduct. Dr. Franklin hath remonstrated and demanded a restoration of the prizes or their value. What effect his memorial will have is uncertain. Three millions of livres are to be advanced annually by France to assist us in procuring cloathing &c for the army. These are the principal articles I can recollect.  As my constituents have thought fit to remove me I could wish to return home as soon as possible, (3) and therefore hope that one of the newly appointed delegates may be directed to set out for this place as soon as may be convenient. It will be absolutely necessary in order to my return, that I should be furnished with a considerable sum of money to enable me to pay my debts, to purchase a horse, one of mine having died, and to bear my expences. There is no money in the Treasury. I have no acquaintance that can supply me; and I very much question whether twenty thousand dollars could be procured here, money is so scarce and the demand for it so great, even upon the credit of the State if I were authorized to offer it. Therefore permit me to urge that that sum be sent to me by the first delegate; otherwise I may be obliged to continue here months at the expence of the State without having it in my power to do it any service.  I am with the highest sentiments of respect, Your Excellency's most obedt. Servt. William Ellery  P.S. The enemy at N.

  Dear sir, Philadelphia 16th May 1780 Your Sentiments respecting the late Plan of Finance, are similar to the Ideas which I had formed of it before the Measure was adopted by Congress, but if the States in general or the Inhabitants of particular States should be divided on the Policy of carrying it into Effect, it may be attended with the most injurious Consequences to the publick Credit, & depreciate if not destroy the Currency of future Emissions. This is not all; it may so weaken the Confidence of the people in Government, as to prevent their obtaining Supplies either by Loans or Taxes adequate to the Expences of the War, & thus serve to protract it & dispose the people to a disadvantageous Peace, whereas by a vigorous Support of the Measure, the temporary Inconveniences which have resulted thereupon & cannot now be remedied, will be forgot & amply recompensed by the Reduction of the national Debt & the easy Taxes consequent to the Establishment of Peace. The principal objection which I had to the plan was its Inconsistency with the Faith of the publick pledged by Congress, but Embarrassment in the Execution of their Resolves will not serve to remedy but may greatly increase the Evil.  The Marquis de la Fayette arrived in this City the last Evening, & I had the Pleasure of a Visit from him with Letters from our Friends Mr Adams & Mr Dana: (1) they are agreably situated in Paris waiting the Events of War to produce an alteration in the mad Disposition of the Ministry of G Britain, which nothing but misfortune can alter. France are making great Exertions in our Favour, & are determined to preserve a Superiority at Sea. Britain has no Prospect of an Alliance with Russia or any other Power, but has succeeded in obtaining Supplies of Money for the ensuing Campaign. The Irish Nation are firm in their Resolutions to be independent of the parliament of G Britain & the County Meetings & Committees of Correspondence are carrying on the good Work of reducing the Power of the Crown, whilst the King is manifesting his Resentment to these proceedings by dismissing his County Lieutenants & such other officers as countenance them. Holland are extremely incensed at the Capture of their Ships, & are no Ways disposed to comply with the Requisitions of Sir Joseph York for furnishing Britain with a naval Force. On the whole, Things wear a favorable aspect in Europe & the West Indies, & We want but little Animation to extend it to America. Charlestown was safe on the 20th of April, but General Lincoln informed the MAY 16, 1780  Governor of Virginia, that Troops were wanted.

  [May 16, 1780] We are yet anxious for the fate of Charlestown, having no advices from thence later than to the 15th of April. There was no account in New-York on the 10th of this month of its being taken, whence MAY 16, 1780  we may conclude it was in our hands as late at least as to the first of May.  Great apprehensions prevail in New-York of a visit there from a naval force. A packet arrived in a short passage from England the 3d of this month, upon which two dispatch boats in less than 48 hours were sent off to Sir Henry Clinton. New works are throwing up at the narrows, and a large number of vessels are loaded with stone ready to sink in the channel. Lines are also forming across from the east to the north river just without the chain of redoubts, and the militia are continually exercising and on fatigue.  Congress have lately received dispatches from abroad, down to the 4th of March. The disposition of Europe never appeared more favourable to our cause than at present. The resources of France and Spain will be greatly drawn forth against the common enemy this year; and America, comprehending the West Indies, will be an early and capital object of their attention.  Great Britain has received a fresh denial of assistance from Russia; and has by her late insolent and piratical proceedings against the Dutch roused the spirit of that nation also against her. Nor is the like to receive any aid from Denmark, which though armed is armed against the insults of Great-Britain. No troops will be drawn this year from Germany more than to recruit the regiments already in the British service.  The claims of Ireland are in a regular train, still advancing; and will probably stop short of nothing less than independence of the British parliament, which is certainly the point they ought to aim at. The conventions and committees of correspondence in England have given so much alarm that spirited measures are taking to suppress them. His majesty has been advised to break every county lieutenant that has given countenance to the late meetings and consultations of the people, which advice he has thought fit to accept, and time must shew with what success.  Our agent at Nantz writes that ten thousand complete suits of cloaths for the army would be shipped in a very short time and fifteen thousand stands of arms. Cloth was also purchased for seven or eight thousand suits more.  The fund in France for payment of the interest bills of exchange, notwithstanding some evil surmises to the contrary, still remains good and punctual payment will continue to be made. The credit of these States is in no danger of failing abroad, and with prudent management it can never fail at home.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia May 17th 1780 I embrace the earliest & best opportunity of acknowledging the receipt of your's, dated, Wilmington 21st April, & need not, I trust, express, how much I join with you in anxious expectation of hearing the fate of our Capital, & the brave men within it. I am, however, not without my hopes, & am convinced, that if Sir Henry has not Succeeded before this time, he never will. The Garrison & inhabitants of New York have been thrown into the greatest confusion by news received from Europe, repeated councils of war have been held, repeated expresses sent off to Clinton, & the citizens, as well as the military, are called out to fatigue duty; they are erecting works between the two rivers, and a battery at the lookout, on Staten Island, whilst a number of vessels have been prepared, & are ready to be Sunk, with a view of obstructing the entrance of the harbor. These facts, joined to the information we have received from Europe, lend us to expect the appearance of a friendly force. I thought it of the MAY 17, 1780  greatest consequence that our friends in Carolina should be immediately made acquainted with our expectations in this matter, as it may be attended with no Small influence upon their councils. As my Colleague Matthews is on a committee at Camp, (1) I am deprived of his advice with respect to that part of your letter, which hints the expediency of transmitting to Mr. Adams, a Similar commission, to that which you now hold, but have thought it best upon reflection, not to mention any thing about the matter, answering in general terms to all enquiries, that you were at Wilmington, & waiting for a Safe opportunity to embark. Should we be so unfortunate as to lose Charles Town, it will not then be too late to transmit a commission to Mr. Adams, but should our enemies be disappointed, you will in that case, I flatter myself, my dear Sir, be prevailed upon to make the attempt, & may do it with a far greater prospect of Success, if not embarrassed with the interference of another Person. We have had quires of paper from our Ministers abroad, but they contain little else but extracts from French & English Newspapers, except on one head which I have alluded to in the other page of this letter, & which prudence forbids my discussing on paper. Should any thing material take place, I should esteem it a particular favor to hear from you, & will endeavor to deserve it, by giving every degree of information from this quarter.

  Sir, Philadelphia 18th May 1780 General Arnold in his Letter to Congress of the 12th Instant having Reference to the Draught of a Report, which I made at the Board MAY 18, 1780  of Treasury whilst a Member thereof, has rendered it necessary for me to rectifie several Errors, if they can be so called, under which the General has laboured in stating that Matter.(1)  Congress having on the 27th of April 1779 referred to the Board of Treasury, General Arnolds Petition of the same Date, on the 28th I proposed the Draught mentioned to be adopted by them, as their Report to Congress. Soon after it was read, the Board being disposed to rise, directed it to be filed with the Petition for future Consideration; but before this could take Place, the Commissioners of the Chamber of Accounts to whom General Arnolds Accounts had been long before referred, applied to the Secretary or Clerk of the Board for that Petition, & probably received with it, inadvertently, the Draught mentioned. Be this as it may, I knew nothing of the Matter then, nor for a considerable Time after, untill some Gentlemen of the Treasury informed me, that General Arnold had been propagating such a Report as is contained in his Letter to Congress. I must confess that I could scarcely credit the Information, being conscious to myself, that General Arnold had no just Grounds for such a Proceeding, but presuming it had originated by Mistake, I enquired of the Members & other officers of the Treasury & Chamber of Accounts whether General Arnold had received his Intelligence from them, & was informed, that he had not but on the other Hand, that some of them had explained to him the Matter. This I supposed would have been satisfactory to him, & altho' he had acted unkindly in spreading the Rumour, I presumed he would rectifie it, & tho't no more thereof. But not long after, conferring with him at the Door of Congress on the Subject of his Accounts, which I had taken much Pains to have settled to his Satisfaction & with Justice to the Publick, he hinted to my great Surprize the Circumstance before related, & after I had declared to him on my Honor, that the Paper was sent to the Commissioners without my Consent or Knowledge, he still appered desirous of believing otherwise. I then informed him that he was at Liberty to think as he pleased on the matter, & that he could not produce any Evidence, or a single Circumstance in Support of his Suggestion: on which he said, that he tho't he had received his Information from Mr Carmichael, who coming up to Us soon after, was interrogated on the Subject, & utterly denied that he had given such Information, & further said that he knew or believed the contrary.  Having thus stated Facts to the best of my Memory, I must beg the Indulgence of Congress in making a few Remarks on the General's Letter. He first says, that the Draught of the Report was \""designed for the Commissioners of the Chamber of Accounts to make on his Accounts.\"" Herein he is unfortunately confuted by the Copy of the Report which he has transmitted to Congress, for it begins thus \""The Comme. having likewise considered a petition from Major   General Arnold of the 27th Instant referred to them by Congress, beg Leave to report.\"" And if the General will be at the Trouble of looking at the printed Journals of Congress of the 27th of April 1779 he will find his Petition was referred to the Board of Treasury, & not to the Commissioners of Accounts; how, then can it be supposed that the Report was draughted for the Commissioners, when it otherwise appears by the Draught itself? And here it may be proper to enquire, how the General came by an original Paper of the Treasury, for speaking of the Draught he says, \""the original I have in his (meaning my own) Hand writing.\"" I have no objection for my own Part to his being indulged with the Original of that or any other of my Essays, but I cannot learn from any of the Officers of the Treasury that he is properly possessed of that Paper, & am unable to conceive that any Person, even a Member of Congress has a Right to take from any office an original Paper without being properly authorized so to do, or that the General is not highly reprehensible for this his Conduct.  General Arnold is equally unhappy in his next Observation, that \""the Report as appears by the Date was drawn up previous to the Commissioners examining his Accounts,\"" for it is well known that his Accounts had been a long Time before under the Examination of the Commissioners of Accounts, altho' they had not finished that Business.  The General is still more unfortunate in his third Assertion, that the Report was \""presented to him by one of the Commissioners as Instructions or the Sentiments of the Treasury Board sent to them to govern in the Settlement of his Accounts,\"" for the Commissioners utterly deny this, as shall appear to Congress when they deem it expedient. I shall forbear to make any Remarks on the Inconsistency of supposing, that the Draught alluded to was intended as Instructions, or that it could have been sent in such a Form, & on a Scrawl, \""as the Sentiments of the Treasury,\"" to the Commissioners, to govern them in the Settlement of General Arnolds Accounts.  The General Concludes by saying \""How far Mr Gerry's Conduct on giving private Instructions to the Commissioners of Accounts, tending to influence their Conduct in a Matter that was to be ultimately Judged & determined by the Treasury Board of which he was a Member can be justified upon the principles of Honor or Equity, or how far his Instructions & Influence have operated in occasioning the Disputes which have arose on the Settlement of my Accounts, Congress will determine.\"" And there Congress will give me Leave to request, that General Arnold may be furnished with a Copy of this Letter, & have Leave to produce his Evidence if any he has, that I ever gave \""private Instructions\"" of any Kind \""to the Commissioners of Accounts.\"" The assertion I declare on my Honor to be an Untruth, & submit to Congress, whether any Part of my Conduct whilst a   Member of the Board of Treasury or of Congress, has been inconsistent with, And whether General Arnolds Conduct in this Affair can be justified on \""the principles of honor or Equity.\"" The last Part of this paragraph seems to explain General Arnolds Conduct in endeavouring to fix on me an unmerited Stigma, for therein he suggests that my \""Instructions & Influence has Operated in occasioning the Disputes which have arose in a Settlement of his Accounts.\"" I have never been desirous of occasioning Disputes in the Settlement of General Arnolds Accounts; if they are right they will undoubtedly be allowed And He will have no Reason to apprehend Injury from Disputes, but if erroneous (which seems to be the Opinion of all the Boards & Committees who have reported thereon) surely they ought not only to be disputed but corrected, or disallowed. But I presume enough has been said to convince Congress, that General Arnolds Observations relative to my Conduct are without Foundation, & that they are equally so with Respect to the Commissioners of Accounts. The Board of Treasury whose Business it was to attend to the Conduct of the Commissioners, never had Reason to suppose (whilst I was a Member thereof) that they were capable of undue Influence, And if We may judge from their Disputes with General Arnold, he has no Reason to conceive that he can influence them; on the other Hand, they had ever manifested in their office, such Abilities & Integrity, that Congress as well as the Board of Treasury always tho't it their Duty to support them. But Sir, if persons who have Accounts to settle with the publick are thus permitted to misrepresent the Conduct of the Officers of Boards instituted with proper Checks for the Security of Individuals as well as the publick, & upon every Dispute relative to the propriety of a Charge to appeal to Congress, or Committees thereof; will not the Intention of Congress in providing such Institutions be utterly frustrated, & may not the publick Accounts be as well adjusted, & a considerable Expence be saved, by dismissing the officers established for this Purpose, & by permitting such persons to choose or be their own Arbiters? The unprovoked Attack made by General Arnold on my Character has obliged me to be thus explicit which I hope Congress will excuse, & remain sir with every Sentiment of Respect for them as well as Yourself, your most obedt., & most hum, servt, E.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia, 18th May 1780. You may be surprized at hearing of me again from this place after my determination to leave it. I had indeed set out but was stoped by the important intelligence that has been communicated to you & which is too delicate to dwell upon in a letter.(1)  It gives me extreme pain to see the Vermont business so long delayed, but we find it impossible to proceed in it for want of a full representation; the moment we have, I shall endeavour to bring it on, (2) if I can stay so long tho' as my money & credit are exhausted & my affairs not in the most promissing situation at home I have MAY 18, 1780  some doubts on this point. You have heard of poor Morris's misfortune in the loss of his leg; he bears it w'th becoming fortitude and is, I hope, in a fair way of recovery.  We have an account by the way of New Berry Port that a fleet of 8 sail of the line were on the coast of Georgia on their way to Charlestown on the 3d of May; should this prove true & our other expectations be answered we have every reason to hope that this campaign will terminate the war in America.  I hope our State have had the prudence to stop the sale of the confiscated property & to make use of it as a fund for the redemption of their money. I have drawn upon the treasury for the amount of my taxes, having no other possible way of discharging them while here & as the State is greatly in my debt I hope they will answer my bills. Your Excellency will do me a favor by getting some genl. resolution for this purpose. I am, D'r Sir, with the highest esteem & resp't your Excellency's most obt. Hum: Serv't,  Robt. R. Livingston.

  Reverend dear Sir, Philadelphia May 19. 1780. Your favor of the 1st instant came to hand a few days since, & it gave me sensible pleasure after so long silence.  I have not seen anything of your scheme that you mentioned as being sent forward before, but as you have been so kind as to mention the substance of it I will give you my opinion upon the matter. Congress will not be likely to do any thing about it; as they intend to fix their money agreeably to their resolutions of the 18th of march last and all the money now in circulation is considered by them as not being more than sufficient to pay the taxes called for & furnish the supplies for the army as lately requested. This must fully appear if you attend to their resolutions above mentioned as well as several other proceedings of Congress; Such a plan as you propose I have often tho't of and many others as finance has engaged a great part of my attention for 18 months past, but after well considering of the same I was of opinion that it wou'd not be advisable for Congress to go into such a measure; for they are not [so] much endeavouring to get the bills out of circulation as to procure money & provisions to carry on the war, and if the good people incline to pay their taxes in hard money or the new bills when they come out at the rate of 1  MAY 19, 1780  for 40, I am very sure Congress will have no objection; I wish what I have mentioned above to be considered ownly of my opinion so far as it respects Congress. I shou'd suppose the Board of Treasury to be the proper place to take under consideration such a scheme & give directions as they are vested with great powers particularly respecting bills of exchange at this time and was I to act as one of that Board I might be of different opinion from what I shou'd be as a member of Congress when acting as such.  The foreign intelligence bro't by the Marquis is considered here as being much in our favor, but as I suppose you collected the chief of it soon after he arrived I shall not be more particular, the Accounts from Madrid recd. a few days before are also agreeable.  We have no of f icial intelligence from the southern army since about the middle of April, but some accounts by private persons are to about the last when all was safe.  Thus far I had wrote when your favor of the 24th ultimo came to hand, but I have not time to make much addition.  Congress sit near half the last night & you may expect pressing calls upon the states. (1) We have not a moments time to lose if we expect to reap immediate advantages from the exertion of our Ally in our favor.  The committee that prepared the late resolutions on finance was Mr Ellsworth of Cont., Genl. Schuyler, N.Y., Mr. Houston NJ., Mr. Livingston, N.Y., Mr. Burke, N.C., & myself but I consider Mr Ellsworth as the Father of them as he put the first outlines on paper, & is a very worthy man.

  Sir, Circular In Congress May l9th. 1780 Congress have recd authentic information that his most Christian Majesty is preparing to send a powerful Naval & Land force to some part of the Continent of North America. (1) This force generously calculated either to produce a diversion in our favour, or to forward the Operation of our Arms by being directed to the same object, may either by our exertions be made the means of delivering our Country in the course of the Campaign from the ravages of War, or being rendered ineffectual through our supiness serve only to sully the reputation of our Arms, to defeat the benevolent intention of  MAY 19, 1780  our great Ally & to disgrace our Confederacy in the Eyes of all Europe.  Every State that reflects upon the depreciation of the Currency & their own deficiency in the payment of their taxes must necessarily conclude that the Treasury is exhausted. The military departments are at a stand for the want of money to put them in motion. Congress have no resources but in your spirit & Virtue, upon these they confidently rely. You know the value of the prize for which you contend, nor need you be informed how much you are interested in a speedy termination of this distressing & expensive war.  But as the smallest disappointment in the requisitions they make may be attended with the most serious consequences, they have endeavoured so to limit their demands as not to exceed your power to comply with them.  The sum for which you are called upon by the within resolution they flatter themselves you will furnish to the Treasury by the fifteenth of June at furthest, without neglecting to discharge the orders that have been drawn upon you for the whole of which, you will receive credit on your account of taxes due on the first of March last.(2)  As this Money is absolutely necessary to put the Army in motion, independant of the purchase of provisions, we trust you will by no means remit your attention to the forwarding your quota of supplies, which the present exigency renders more requisite than ever.  It may not be improper to suggest to you, that if a strict & immediate collection of taxes should be insufficient to procure the necessary sums within the time limited, it may perhaps be more speedily obtained by Loans.  Congress for the greater dispatch, have thought it expedient to appoint a Committee to assist the Commander in Chief in drawing out supplies-As their powers will be inadequate to the purposes of their appointment unless they shall derive their force from the States to whom they will be under the necessity of applying. They most earnestly request you, if you should find it inconvenient to continue your sessions to lodge such powers in your Executive, or some part of your Legislative body, as will enable them at this interesting period on the application of the Committee to call forth the resources of your State.(3)  Congress trust that these requisitions will not appear unnecessary, when compared with the information on which they are grounded. In the importance of which they doubt not that you will find a sufficient Apology for the demand, and the warmth with which they intreat you to carry these measures into immediate execution.

  Sir [May 19, 1780](1) I wrote to your Excellency yesterday. I trouble you again about matters of a private nature if those can be called so in which the honor & justice of the publick are materialy interested. On the last assessment I was rated at £3300. By a Letter recd. yesterday from my Agent I am informed that I am again rated at £9000 & that the whole of my income notwithstanding the most assiduous endeavour to collect it does not amount to 600 Bushls. of wheat. I have no personal property & occupy a small farm which does not half pay the expence of cultivating it. The profits of a valuable profession & my whole time I have devoted to the publick for a very triffling compensation which I have seldom recd. but to give to others who I thought more distressed than myself together with considerable  MAY 19, 1780  additions out of my private fortune. I have already since I have been at this place expended upwards of sixty thousand dollars in order to maintain the character with which I am invested, a small proportion of which will be repaid me by the State. I need not add to this the unremited endeavours that I have exercised to promote the freedom & happiness of my country or the heavy losses I have sustained by the ravages of the enemy. These I think sufficiently evidence my willingness to bear my full proportion of the burthens of the war but surely some rule of proportion ought to be established. Taxation never can go beyond what a man can spare after the necessaries of life are afforded out of his income. If the publick conceive that I have no merrit on account of the sacrafices I have made & that my whole time & the profits of a profession which would with less expence of Labour, health & peace than my publick employments cost me procure an elegant competance-let them treat me as criminals are treated in some countries, let them take my whole estate into their hands & allow me so much out of it as they conceive necessary to support me in the manner in which they would wish me to live- or let them if take my whole income into their hands & strip me of publick employments & leave me to support myself by my own industry. To either of these I will chearfully submit. To both I cannot without injustice to myself & family. I shall be told that these matters doe not lie within the Reach of the legislature to whom I wish the letter to be communicated. But surely Sir a servant of the publick who by his attention to their interest is placed in such a situation as not to be able to attend to his own affairs as the ordinary modes of procuring redress must expect that the government will take care that bare justice is done him and that a respect for their commands shall not be the means of his ruin. The least I conceive that a publick Officer may expect is that no final assessment be made till his return home but that the charges remain against him till the Legislature can within a reasonable time after his return afford him an opportunity of combating its justice or so ordering his affairs as to pay it neither of which it is [. . .] to do in my present situation. (And I shall f ind myself In the necessity of quiting a State which suffers my ruin As the price of my endeavours to serve them. As I have it in my power to settle advantageously here or goe abroad I [. . .] now whether it is the intention of the Legislature to sacrifice their servants to the). I intreat you to believe sir that I entertain too high an opinion of the Legislature to [be]lieve that it is either their wish or their in[tention] to render the ruin of their servants the price of their [la]bours. I flatter myself that the bare mention of it will [con]vince them to do me ample justice for an injury which has unavoidably risen out of their system of taxation. If otherwise Sir you will do me the favour to inform me as soon as possible as I have it now in my power to make an advantageous settlement here or to go abroad upon honourable terms.(2)  ""

  Dear Sir, Philada. 20 May 1780. On the Receipt of your Excellency's Favour of 11 March last, I made it my Business to cast about for some Mode in which Colo. Diriks might be employed to better Effect for the Publick and more agreeably to himself, than was the Case at that Time and unfortunately continues so still.(1) Finding that suitable Expedient was attainable, I informed him in such Manner as to deserve, as far as possible, your Excellency's recommendation of my Frankness and Candour. Shortly after this some Circumstances turning up which it was thought probable would call the attention of Congress more particularly than heretofore to the Affairs of Holland, Colo. Diriks, with the Advice of his Friends, applied for Leave to return thither with a Recommendation to Mr. Laurens for Employment, the means of defraying the Expenses of his Passage, such Testimony in Favour of his Merit as might be thought proper and the Commission instead of the Brevet of a Lieutt Colonel. Congress were not willing to grant the first and last of these requests, lest they should embarrass Mr. Laurens, to whose Discretion they had confided the Employment of such Persons as he should find necessary in managing his Mission; and lest they should make an improper use of Rank in the army, upon which Subject they have for some Time past become very cautious. The Resolutions which they passed not being satisfactory to the Colonel, they were revoked. He has lately made a second application, which has been referred to a Committee to which I happen to belong.(2) How sucessful our report may be, I am not able to conjecture; but am not greatly sanguine though for some Reasons, not of Moment to detain your Excellency, I advised the Application. It remains only that I do my utmost for a Man who is active, informed, and closely attached to our Cause, and who, I believe, from his Connections in his own Country, would be very useful to us there. As Mr Laurens has not yet left America, and we have some Circumstances favouring his Return to this Place before he sails the Matter is delayed a little for the present and I have to assure your Excellency that I shall continue to pay due Attention to your Ideas on the Subject.  I am extremely sorry for Mr Laurens's Disappointment in not being able to embark from Charlestown, agreeably to his Expectations when he went from hence. The State of Affairs in Holland is,  MAY 20, 1780  at this Time, critically wavering, and many Circumstances promise us great Advantage: the Importance of an early Connection and good understanding with us, the Strength of the Confederacy against England and the violent and pyratical Insults upon the Commerce of the Provinces. We are told by Letters from Europe that the Insults upon the Dutch Commerce operate so strongly, that the Stadtholder begins to be doubtful whether it is politick further to support the Interest of the British Court so unreservedly as he has hitherto done. The Friends of America have a favourable Occasion, and great is our Loss in not being in Condition to make the most of it.  All Intelligence from the other Side of the water is favourable, and if we can but play our Part well in a vigorous Campaign, great are the Benefits which, through the Blessing of Divine Providence we may hope to acquire.

  Dear Sir Morris town May 20th 1780 I ought not to Complain that I have not been favored with a line as I have not done myself the pleasure to address you one Since we parted. I am however perhaps the most Excusable of the two as I have been closely kept doing something or other in the public way.(1)  My Colleagues on Committee for arrangements are Mr Mathews & Mr. Peabody. We are daily engaged In that business without however making the Progress I wish. The want of Money in the Treasury, the want of Magazines here, and the Scarcity of the necessary Supplies, and the want of public Virtue, combine to embarrass us exceedingly. The Quarter Master General threatens to resign & his Deputys refuse to Act, because they deem themselves Injured by some resolutions of the treasury Board. The System of State Supplies we find Inadequate to the purposes It was Intended for, & more Expensive than a well directed purchasing System would be. The Army has been two days without meat, and they may be so ten days more for aught the Commissary knows to the Contrary. The Soldiery are uneasy. They begin to attribute to a want of resource what they had been Brought to believe proceeded from Accidental Impediment. This is a disagreable picture of things. But heaven which Indulgently Smiles on America I trust will brighten the prospect. It is said the Marquis de La Fayette has brought something favorable; should Our ally send a fleet, and we Rouse from our torpor into Exertion, we might possibly drive the Enemy from the Continent at least from this part of It In the Course of the Campaign-but remember that without great exertion every attempt to It will fail, and I conceive It better not to begin, than to begin without a probable prospect of success.  On Sunday last governeur Morris's horses ran away In the streets of Philadelphia. He leaped out of the Phaeton, and shattered the MAY 20, 1780  bones of his left leg so much that It became necessary to amputate It. There are good hopes of his recovery.  Accounts from New York announce that Count de Guichon with his fleet has sailed from the West Indies, (2) and supposed for the American coast. Vessels are filling with Stones to stop the Channel at the narrows, and fire rafts making. Betts run three to two at York that Charles town will not be taken, we also begin to think so. The president writes me of the 18th \""We have in town some favorable reports from Charles town but I dare not yet Communicate them as true.\""(3)  As soon as we have made the arrangements here, I propose to examine the posts to the Northward and reduce numbers that are now preying on the public; that done I hope to set quietly down to my farm.  A most Extraordinary change of Conduct took place in a Certain Gentleman.(4) He was not from the time you left us until I came from Philadelphia once disguised, and has behaved with much propriety since.

I agree perfectly in All the Sentiments you express on the bright Prospect which is open to our View, in your anxious wishes that we may avail ourselves affectually of the Cooperation of our generous Ally and in your Opinion of the disgrace of our Councils & our Cause if we shoud be so unwise or so indecisive as not to make the proper Advantage of this golden opportunity to draw the War to a successful Period.

Mr Mathews MAY 21, 1780  will be able to inform you of the obstacles to a Committee plenipo. & I have hinted them to the general: (2) they are deep seated in their human passions and not to be surmounted on the first Impression. That the Reinforcements orderd to the Southward shoud be halted is obvious for the Reasons you assign: but do you expect such a proposition from a Northern Member deeply interested in strengthening the main army? It is a question of the utmost delicacy and even danger: for, however groundlesly, an opinion has been propagated that Congress meant to sacrifice the two southermor States & it has been productive of great Animosity and discontent.

I have laboured hard to bring about a recal of the Maryland Line but without success. To move it myself would have lost us the confidence of the Southern States & excited an oposition which would have effectualy deprived us of the power of being useful upon other occasions. I endeavoured to prevail on Mr. Jones or Mr. Matthews to make the proposal, in which case we could have supported it with so much force as to have overborne all oposition. They were brought to wish it, but did not dare to move it when it came to the point so that all that we shall be able to do will be to direct them to return in case they hear the siege is raised before they arrive at Charlestown. I shall myself venture to move tomorrow for the return of Lees corps (2) the cavalry of which have not yet left the place. We have likewise appointed a committee to confer with the Minister on the procuring supplies for the French troops,(3) & to obtain intelligence of the strength of the enemy at the several ports, & the soundings of the several bays and harbours &c.

  Sir, Philadelphia 21st May 1780 We are sorry to be obliged to inform your Excellency that, notwithstanding our Efforts to bring the matter of the New Hampshire Grants to a Decision, unavoidable Obstructions have prevented it to this day. On the 2d of March last it was made an order of the day for the 7th. In that Interval the new plan of Finance which had been before on the Table was resumed, and we were with great Reluctance compelled by the pressing Instances of Congress to permit the order of the day to give way to the more general and, as they insisted, more pressing Business of Finance. By this means the order of the day was postponed from time to time till the 18th of March when the Plan of Finance was compleated. In this Interval Mr Forbes a Delegate from Maryland fell sick and soon after died & that State became unrepresented. Georgia being also unrepresented, and New York, MAY 21, 1780  Massachusetts and New Hampshire disqualified by the Resolutions of the 24th of September, nine disinterested States were not represented in Congress. Notwithstanding this Impediment we thought it right to shew our Earnestness to prosecute to effect a business of so much Importance to our State; and therefore on the 21st March moved to proceed to the order of the day; but \""it was resolved that the same be postponed, nine States exclusive of those which are parties to the Question not being represented in Congress\"". In this Condition the business has been suspended; for tho' Georgia has been represented within three days Delaware has been unrepresented for several weeks. However to lose no Opportunity of manifesting the Solicitude which we felt, we, two days since, on the reading of your Excellency's Letter of the 9th Instant and some of the papers attending it, again moved to proceed to the order of the day; and the same Objection of the want of a Representation of nine disinterested States being urged, it was ordered \""that the President write to the Executives of the States of Delaware and Maryland to urge them to send forward immediately and to keep up a Representation in Congress as matters of the highest Consequence are now before them.\"" (1) At the same time your Excellency's dispatches of the 25th Ult. (2) were Laid before Congress and so much as related to the Depredations of the Indians refered to a Committee.(3)  We propose to prevail upon Congress to come into some pointed Resolutions to censure the Vermonteers for their Contempt of their Authority and the Recommendations of the only Body who can preserve the peace of the Confederacy.(4) Something of this kind seems to be necessary to check the Violence of our Adversaries and to comfort and encourage the peaceable Citizens within the controverted Jursidiction. The nature and Success of this Measure we shall communicate to your Excellency by Major Hunt if he can be prevailed upon to wait the Issue.(5)  We feel, Sir, the utmost Anxiety, for our frontier fellow Citizens. Nothing for their Protection, which is within the power of the State ought to be neglected: especially as we foresee that all the Forces which can be raised under the Authority of Congress will find full Employment in the active and offensive Campaign which is soon to open. The of ficial Communications from the President, on the bright Prospect which is displayed by the promised Cooperation of our great and generous Ally, will fully explain to your Excellency what we have in Contemplation.(6) It woud be highly improper for us to enter into any detail on a subject which requires Secrecy as much as it does Vigour and Decision. A Committee of Congress residing at Head Quarters, of whom General Schuyler is Chairman, are authorized to correspond with the Governments of the respective States to direct and draw forth the necessary Supplies, and to effectuate, as far as possible, the Plan of Operations. To that Committee your Excellency  will be pleased to be referred. It gives us pleasure to be perswaded that our State by the wisdom, the Liberality, and the Promptitude, of her Measures, at this most critical and important conjuncture, will manifest to the World that she merits the Freedom for which we contend and the generous Cooperation of our Ally to secure the Blessing, by the total Expulsion of our Enemies from this Continent.  We are in Pain for the fate of Charles Town: the Enemy having turned almost their whole Force by Sea and Land, against one of the weakest members of the Confederacy: while it's distance renders it impracticable to send forward sufficient Reinforcements in Season. The garrison were safe the 28th of April; from a severe and incessant Cannonade they had lost Only fourteen Lives, and otherwise suffered very inconsiderable damage. But the Besiegers proceeding with the utmost Caution have gaind ground and brought their works within 70 yards of the Defences. In this critical Situation the place remaind by our last Advices. The Garrison had made a successful Sortie killing a number of the Besiegers, and taking some Prisoners; but no decisive Advantages had attended it, as the Enemy maintain their ground and press forward with an apparent Resolution to carry the Town by regular Approaches.  The great Change which has taken place in the System of our Finances calls for an Alteration in the Mode of supporting the Members of Congress. We never approved of drawing money from the Continental Treasury; and only submitted to it because it had become a general Practice; and we were otherwise unprovided for. That Appropriations should take place, on the application of an Individual, for his own use, was equally improper with respect to the publick, and degrading to ourselves. At present the Treasury here is quite exhausted, and we must request the favour of a regular Supply in future and more especially of a speedy Remittance to discharge our debts which are become very burthensome as, not foreseeing this difficulty, we are entirely unprepared. To estimate the Expence in nominal money might call into Question our (Economy in a State which has not yet reached the Summit of Extravagance which prevails in this City. Our board alone we shall mention as a Specimen being, according to a late demand, for a Gentleman and his Servant £270 Contl. per Week, exclusive of even table beer. We imagine, however, that the Value of six specie dollars a day with good Management may be a decent Allowance, exchange here between that and paper money being 60 for one. We observe that the Delegates of our State were originally allowed four dollars a day, and the price of every Article of Expence to which we are now exposed is at least double. We are far from wishing to derive a Profit from our publick Employment: on the Contrary it woud give us the highest Satisfaction if the Legislature shoud think it expedient to provide a House and Table for us, under the direction of a Steward, as in that Case we shoud keep   our hands clear of the publick money, and be excused from the Trouble of accounts. Let it not however, be understood that we sollicite this or any other particular Mode of providing for our Support; for we mean, with the utmost Deference, to submit it wholly to the Legislature. May we entreat the Favour of your Excellency to communicate this Letter, with our most respectful Complements, to that honourable Body; (7) and to believe that we are, with the utmost Respect and Regard, Dear Sir, Your Excellency's most Obedient & very humble Servants,  Jas.

  Sir Morristown May 21st. 1780 I was this morning Informed that about two hundred batteau men were engaged at Albany for the public service, but that they had  MAY 21, 1780  determined to leave the service as they could not procure their pay; Impressed with the necessity of retaining a body of men whose services, should any Offensive operations be prosecuted against the Enemy, I deemed Essential, I made further enquiry and learnt from a Capt. Sickles, who is an Ass. Quarter Master at Albany, that the men amount to the number I have mentioned, that they are engaged to Serve during the Campaign, at Six dollars per day-that they expected money on his return-that he has none, and that they will certainly Quit the service. I mentioned the matter to the Commander in chief, who is exceedingly anxious to retain them and Intreated me If possible to Suggest the means. If there is no money in the Continental treasury I can devise no other way but that of drawing on the Treasury of the state of New York. If this is done, and there Should be no money in that, I will Immediately give directions for borrowing as much of the money on my own Credit as can be procured, and become personally engaged for the remainder. As no time is to be lost permit me to Intreat the determination of Congress on the Subject and to be advised thereof.(1)  I have the honor to be with Sentiments of great Respect & Esteem, Your Excellency's Most Obedient, Humble Servant,  Ph.

  Sir, Philada. 22 May 1780 I have the Honour to enclose for the Use of the Legislature a Boston Paper of the 8 inst which I have this Day received by Post, containing the Act of the Legislature of the State of Massachusetts bay on the Proceedings of Congress of the 18 March last, relative to Finance.(1) I think it my Duty to communicate every Thing on this Subject which comes to my Hands, as to me the Matter appears of the most indispensible Importance; but shall not detain further upon it, having already explained myself pretty fully. I only beg Leave to observe, that if I had not thought the Interest of the State deeply concerned, I should not have been so explicit, especially since I have heard that a Variety of Sentiments prevails among those who are certainly capable of judging. This has aroused my Caution, but upon a careful review of the whole Subject, and Examination of all I have read and heard, I must still venture to say, that Something is necessary to be done, and that no Expedient appears to me so promising and adviseable, every Circumstance considered, as the one now in Question.  By communicating the several Acts as I receive this I do not expect that the Legislature will be so much influenced by Example, as assisted in framing a Law on the Subject. It may indeed be Matter of Encouragement that the Measure is elsewhere adopted, but as one  MAY 22, 1 780  State cannot be injured by adopting it before another but rather the contrary, there can be no Objection to take early rank in this Instance.  I have heard it alledged that these Resolutions involve a Breach of Faith. Though no such Thing appears to me, yet if by any Construction it is inferred, it will probably operate to induce the Legislature to have out the comparison between specie and the present Bills, and retain only that between the latter and the new Bills to be emitted. How far this will be an effectual Provision, I pretend not to determine; the Consequences may be examined and it is of the highest Moment to weigh them.  Lest it should escape the recollection of the Legislature I take the liberty to mention that the Embargo Act continued the 25th of December last in Consequence of a recommendation of Congress of the 15th of the same Month, was limited to the first of April last. The expected Events of this Campaign, the present State of Provisions, the Prospects of the coming Crop, far from being so favourable as could be wished, all conspire to urge the Propriety of reviving and continuing that Act. The Matter was lately agitated in Congress, but as no Instance of Exportation was known, except from Delaware, and it was said the Embargo was in Force in the other States, a resolution was extended no farther than Delaware.(2) We did not mention New Jersey because there was no Doubt the Legislature on adverting to the Circumstances above-mentioned would take the necessary measures.  The State of Pennsylvania has applied to Congress for Direction with respect to the Propriety of receiving the Certificates given in the Staff Departments in the Payment of Taxes. As I see the highest Probability the measure will be approved and recommended I take the Liberty to apprise the Legislature.(3) I see no Prospect of any other Answer to the Address and representation of 15th March last, and am of Opinion that Time need not be lost in waiting to hear from Congress. No Means in the Power of the Delegates of the States has been omitted, to obtain some other Mode of discharging the Debts due to the Inhabitants and avoiding the Necessity of resorting to this Expedient, but without Effect.  The Proceedings of Saturday last you have, ere now, received. I doubt not the President has suggested the Propriety of Secrecy. For though these Things are noising abroad, they are Surmises without Information. I speak particularly of the Contents of the Letter. The Occasion is highly interesting and the Improvement of it may be attended with the most happy Consequences.(4)  I have the Honour to be, your Excellency's most obedt hble Servt. William Ch.

  Dear Sir, Philad. 23d May 1780 The Marquiss de la fayette handed me your favour of the 14 Instant which woud have been sooner Answerd had not my Time beenfully employd.(1) You will learn the difficulties of constituting a Commitee plenipo. from another Channel; tho' a little Reflection upon human nature and a republican Government, might have brought them fully to your View without Assistance. What is not committed Congress stand ready to Support by their united Voice and Efforts, being resolved to Act with Vigour and Decision; so as to render the present Campaign glorious & Successful. The Committee have all the powers Congress can give to render them useful in drawing forth Supplies; & in opening the Necessary Communications with the Civil Governments. As to Military operations they must rest solely with the Commander in Chief; & Congress will not suffer any of their Committees to interfere in the Exercise of his free Judgement. Sometimes advice might be useful, but it is possible it might embarrass; & that Possibility woud have been enough to decide against the Powers had there been no other Objection.  The Marquiss I hope is pleased with the respect paid him by Congress; if it is not altogether agreeable it was not for want of the best and kindest Intentions. He luckily did not think, or at least speak, of the Captain of the Frigate as it must have embarrassed exceedingly from an opposition between the point of Propriety, & a disposition to please a Man to whom America is much indebted & who deserves to be gratified and is in every Respect entitled to my utmost attention. (2) I agree with you my dear Sir that the Conjucture is critical and that much Very much depends on our employing it to advantage: Vigour and diligence in Government and Zeal and Liberality in the People must in the embarressd State of our Affairs conspire to give us a prospect of Success and prevent our disgrace. To you who see things in their true Light I shall not enlarge. May Love and Glory unite to make you as happy as I wish & then you will have nothing MAY 23, 1780  more to claim your Sollicitude: for I am with real Esteem & Affection, Dear Sir, Your most obed Sert, Jas Duane  PS.

  Sir, Philadelphia May 23d. 1780. Since my letter by the last post (1) I have been informed that Genl. Cornell, who was chosen first delegate by the Assembly, was to set out very soon after the election; so that in all probability the money I requested might be sent me by the first delegate that should come on will not come by him. I have now to request your excellency that it may be transmitted as soon as possible for the reasons assigned in my last. I have applied to my acquaintances for a small sum to pay my washer woman and cannot even get that; so scarce is it and so difficult to be had. One of them told me that he had been offer'd thirteen per Ct. for two hundred dollars. I have a warrant on the treasury which I would sell, and sustain the loss of a discount if I could do it; rather than sustain the reproach of repeated dunning, and of continuing here at the expence of the State without being in a capacity to be useful to it. I am not the only poor delegate here, many are in the same circumstances, and have been obliged to write to their States for a supply of Cash. I hope that this matter may be attended to, and that my earnest request may be complied with.  We have no late accounts that may be depended on from Charlestown. Yesterday it was reported that the enemy had attacked the works on the 25th ultimo and were repulsed. This day's report is that no attack had been made on the 28th, that the enemy had  MAY 23, 1780  cannonaded them for 15 days with but small effect. That they had invested the town; but our troops were in good spirits and determined to hold possession to the last. If they have held out to this time it is my opinion that the enemy will abandon the siege. The letter which your excellency will receive from Congress before this reaches you contains the foundation for this opinion. There is a prospect of an active campaign. I wish we may be prepared to oppose them vigorously with the force which may come to our assistance and compell our enemies to be at peace with us.

It being the Idea of Congress that you would find it covenient to accept the Election of Comissary General of Prisoners, and absolutely necessary to fill up the Board of Treasury where Business was suffering much, Mr. William Denning was elected to the Treasury a few Days after as you will see by the Proceedings of 28th ult. I am really unfortuante that, as you decline the Comissariate, we cannot have the Pleasure of your Company in the Board. If Mr Denning should not acquiesce, I shall still think myself authorised, at least for Time, to signify you will accept an Appointment which Accident alone has prevented your receiving.

  In committee of Congress. Sir, Circular No. 1. Morristown, 25th May, 1780.  Yesterday we were honored with a despatch from Congress, conveying to us their resolutions of the l9th instant, together with a copy of their circular letter of the same date, to the several States from New-hampshire to Virginia, inclusive.(1)  By one of the former we are appointed to assist the commander in chief in drawing out supplies for the Army, and the line of conduct we are to pursue, is pointed out in those subsequent: The whole  MAY 25, 1780  having been transmitted to your State, together with the circular letter, it is unnecessary to inclose your Excellency a copy. Immediately on the receipt of these papers, we laid them before the commander in chief, and entreated him to signify what supplies were immediately necessary to enable him to move the Army; and to put it in a condition to co-operate vigourously with the shortly expected succour of the great and generous ally of these States. This request we candidly avow, was made more with a view to preserve form in conducting business, than for want of competent information on the subject, that having already been fully detailed us by the General, and others, on former conferences, when acting as a committee of arrangements, he, consequently, had only to refer us to what had been before delivered us, by him and others, and which was in substance as follows. That the Army was five months pay in arrears; That it had seldom, or ever, since it took this cantonment, had more than six days provision in advance; That at present, it is without meat, and has been on half, and on quarter allowance, for some days past; That the commissaries cannot give any assurances of doing more than barely subsisting the troops, from day to day; That even then, they apprehend a want of meat will frequently prevail; That the Army is greatly deficient in camp equipage; That it is destitute of forage, for the few horses which indispensible necessity has required should be maintained in Camp; (2) That it will require several thousand horses to move the Army, so as to promise any effectual operation from it; That the sick in hospitals, have not a sufficiency of those articles necessary for their comfort; That carriages in considerable numbers are wanted; That the quarter master general has not a competent number of boats for the use of the Army, in case any offensive operations should take place; That he has no materials for constructing new boats, and carriages, nor even for repairing the old; That as every department of the Army is without money, and not even the shadow of credit left, consequently no article, however necessary, can be procured; That the transportation even of the inadequate supply of flour, forage, and other articles hitherto furnished by the States, is at a stand; That very few of the recruits required by the act of Congress, of the 9th of February last, have arrived; That from information received, there is no prospect that any considerable number will timely engage in the service, on voluntary inlistment; That by the expiration of the terms for which men were engaged, deaths and desertions, the Army is so greatly reduced, that it does not afford a probable prospect of its acting with any degree of efficacy in merely defensive operations; That the patience of the soldiery, who have endured every degree of conceivable hardship, and borne it with fortitude, and perseverance, beyond the expectations of the most sanguine, is on the point of being exhausted; That a spirit of discontent is encouraged by the arts of the enemy, whose emissaries hold up in printed papers, dis- MAY 25, 1 780  tributed among the soldiery, the most flattering prospects and promises, to enduce them to desert their colours: The evidence given us in support of this detail of facts, has been fully corroborated by our own observations and enquiry; and painful as the contemplation of the distresses our country labours under, may be; we conceive it would have been inconsistent with our duty to have palliated, or disguised them, in an address to the constituents of that body under whose authority we act; as they ought, in our opinion, to be fully informed: For it is to them, this committee is directed to apply, and on them every reliance for relief and assistance must rest, in this very critical and important moment: But so far are we from desponding under this variety of embarrassment, that we reflect with satisfaction, the result of conviction, that the country is not destitute of the resources necessary to enable its Army to act with vigour, and to second the views of our illustrious ally; and that the legislative and executive powers of your State, impressed, as they are, with a just sense of the magnitude of the object, are equally desirous, as capable, of drawing them forth.  Congress, in their circular letter, has pointed generally at the measures necessary to be adopted by the States: We conceive it incumbent on us, in discharge of the trust reposed, to point more minutely at particulars, and in some measure to enter into a detail of them. We are encouraged to this, under a persuasion that the States will impute to our zeal, and affection for the interest and weal of our country, the liberty we take; and not to a spirit of dictating, which would be, equally improper, as presumptuous.  In a letter we had the honor to address Congress on the 16th instant, but which had not reached Philadelphia, when the circular letter and resolutions we have alluded to, were passed, we stated the little probability (which from the information we had obtained) there appeared to be, of completing the quota's of men, called for by the act of Congress, of the 9th of February last, by voluntary inlistment; and we conceived it requisite, to propose a set of resolutions, calculated to draw forth the intended complement of men for the Army, together with a state of the deficiencies-copy of which we have the honor to inclose persuaded that the States can with more facility, and much less expense, make drafts to serve during the campaign, than to engage men to serve during the war, and convinced, from repeated experience, that no reliance is to be made on gaining a sufficient number by voluntary inlistment, should the mode, we have proposed, be as agreeable to the sentiments of the legislature of your State, as it is to those of the commander in chief, we cannot entertain a doubt but that the measure will be adopted with alacrity, and executed with energy.  From the state we have made of the distressed condition of the Army, in point of provision, we are persuaded that every argument   to induce the utmost exertions to fill the magazines, which the commander in chief has directed to be formed, would be needless, as a matter of such importance will certainly claim the most immediate attention of the legislative and executive powers of the States.  Congress, in their act of the 25th of February last, have not called on the States for the transportation of any of the articles of supply, enumerated in that act, beyond the limits of the State furnishing the same. If the officers, whose business it is to direct the transportation, were, or could be furnished in time, with money, for that service, it would probably supercede the necessity of any intervention of the State: As they are not, nor is it probable they can be, even with the best exertions of the States, we humbly recommend, that authority be given by your legislature, to the executive authority, or to such other persons, as they may think proper, to furnish such carriage to the officers acting under the authority of Congress, or their committee, as may be needful, to convey those supplies, or any other, for the public use to the Army, or to such posts and places, where they may be required: And that until the public officers shall have cash in hand to pay for the same, we intreat the legislature of your State, to give assurances to its citizens, that speedy and effectual measures will be taken to make payment of the debts which may be thus incurred, and remain unpaid, with an interest of six per cent, per annum, as stated in the resolutions of Congress, of the 19th instant.  It is more than probable necessity will require, that some States should be called upon for additional supplies to those apportioned to them in the Act of Congress of the 25th of February last; both because our Army, and that of our ally, may take such a position, as that supplies from remote States cannot be brought; and because some States are so exhausted, that they cannot even furnish the quota's assigned them: It therefore becomes essential that similar powers to those stated in the preceding paragraph, should be lodged in the executive authority, or other persons, for furnishing such extra-supplies, on the application of this committee, or officers appointed for that purpose: And to this matter we also intreat permission to draw the attention of your legislature. As it would be hazarding too much to depend on the precarious supply of horses and carriages, which might be furnished by the inhabitants occasionally, to move the artillery, baggage, and stores immediately attached to the Army; and as the aid of the States to procure the horses and carriages in the present exhausted State of the public Treasury, is evidently necessary, we are also constrained to intreat the attention of your legislature to this capital object, and to request that the executive authority, or other persons, may be empowered to comply with the requisition of this committee, or persons by them authorized for that purpose, on the condition mentioned in the paragraph next preceding the last.  Having, Sir, stated the most material articles of the many which are wanted, we beg leave to urge the indispensible necessity of investing your executive authority, or such other persons as your legislature may judge proper to intrust, with ample power to comply with the requisitions of the committee, or other persons by them appointed, for that variety of articles necessary for an Army, and its appendages, and of which, no perfect enumeration can be made; and to rely for reimbursement out of the monies called for from the States. Had it been practicable to have stated the particular extra supplies, which necessity will induce us to call for, from each State, for the support of the Army, and its operations, it would have been our duty to have done so: As it was not, we wish your legislature to believe, that the committee will pay every possible attention, in making requisitions for supplies, so as to render the burden as equal in proportion to the ability of each State, as their situation, and the nature of the service will by any means admit.  It is possible, Sir, that should even the deficiencies to complete the quota of troops apportioned to the States, in February last, join their corps as early as the exigency of affairs certainly require, aid of militia may nevertheless be called for by the commander in chief, and as so much depends on dispatch in offensive operations, we beg leave most earnestly to recommend, that such measures may be adopted as will, effectually draw forth this invaluable resource with as little delay as possible.  Having stated what appears to the committee absolutely requisite to be adopted and pursued by the States, permit us, Sir, to add we are authorized to communicate, that the naval and land force alluded to by Congress in their circular letter, was to have sailed so early from France, that they may be daily expected to arrive on this coast; That the orders given by the court of Versailles, for the line of conduct to be observed by their officers, in combining their force with ours, to operate against the common enemy, clearly evince the most unbounded confidence, and the most unequivocal determination, that it should be directed by American councils and rendered subservient to the interest of these States. This generosity, on the part of our illustrious ally, strongly points at the necessity of taking every precaution in our power, that his views may not be frustrated, nor his arms disgraced. Indeed we should be left without the shadow of an excuse, should we through inattention, or indecision, neglect to avail ourselves of the advantages to which such a capital succour is capable of being improved. We should degrade our character, disgrace our Arms; and evince to all the world, that we were either destitute of resources, wanted exertion to draw them forth; or wisdom to apply them; and either would tend to discredit our cause, and stamp these States with indelible stains of infamy: But Americans are incapable of such folly: They will see the necessity of risking   possible evils, nay even suffering certain, but temporary ones, with fortitude, and sacrificing a portion of property, if such sacrifice is necessary, rather than by withholding it involve themselves and their posterity in misery too painful to be contemplated without the deepest anxiety.  You, Sir, and the legislature of your State, we are fully convinced will, on this occasion, display with additional lustre that virtue and wisdom which have hitherto so emminently distinguished your councils, and, by taking the lead in exertion, will stimulate your citizens to such laudable acts as will amply intitle them to the invaluable blessings of that liberty, peace, and independence, for which they have fought, and bled.  The committee have only to add their wishes, that you, Sir, will be pleased to convene the legislature of the State with as much dispatch as possible, and to lay these our applications before them.

  My dear General, Philadelphia 26th May 1780 We have Intelligence from Charles Town which leaves it in our possession as lately as the 3d or 4th Inst. and we may from the Silence of the Enemy at New York extend our Hopes to the 10th or 12th. The best and most direct Account is to our Friend Mr Jones from Gen Woodford. He has this moment promised me to communicate it to your Excellency which he will do much better than I can from my Memory; (1) otherwise I should attempt it. The Contempt with which Sir Henry Clinton treated the propositions of the Garrison is a sufficient proof of the strong Confidence he entertains of Success: and indeed the gradual Approaches, and the Contiguity, of his Works, which we have not been able to prevent, or even obstruct, free him from the Imputation of Presumption. The determin'd Resolution of the Garrison to defend the Town to the last Extremity will do honour to our Arms, and woud go far to relieve my Apprehensions, if I did not see the utmost probability of their being pushed from the only defensible Ground in our possession, by the Weight of a superior force, operating under an impenetrable Cover, with all the Advantages of deliberate Caution, and military Skill. If, under such discouraging Prospects, we shoud come off Conquerors it will be a further proof of one of the mottos which we have appropriated to our Cause, and often seen verified-nil desperandum! North Carolina is in motion, but something is always deficient. The want of arms is now the Cry!  A St. Kitts paper, which you have probably seen gives an Account of a naval Engagement between the French and English Fleets in the West Indies.(2) It is so palpably absurd that nothing can be collected from it, but that there has been a Rencounter.

  Sir Philada 26 May 1780 Your Excellency receives enclosed Resolutions of Congress of this Date, on the Subject of negociating, in the Payment of Taxes, the outstanding Vouchers given by Persons employed in the Departments of the Commissary General of Purchases and Quarter Master General, for Articles furnished to the publick Service.(1) It is to be regretted that this Provision is not more adequate to the Relief of New Jersey, and a fuller Satisfaction of the Address of the Legislature of the 17th of March last. I will endeavour to give an Account of the State of this Proceeding.  The States of New-York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware are those in which such Notes or Certificates are principally on Hand. New-York has some Time since passed an Act for receiving them in Taxes, under certain Modifications and Conditions, which I need not describe as I took the Liberty to transmit a Copy to the Legislature at the last Sitting. No Measures have been taken respecting them in any of the other States that I have heard. It has been from Time to Time represented that the Taxes could not be collected, even for the last year, and much less for the present, because Payment of Arrears due to the Inhabitants from the publick Departments(2) was not made, by means of which many were unable to answer the collectors; and those who were able, but unwilling took advantage of the pretext.  The consistency of these resolutions with the proceedings of the 1 8th of March last was held a point of indispensible necessity. Nothing which has the color of an interference could be carried in Congress, but in cases of the last extremity. The taxes of two months are there appropriated to discharge outstanding debts, and I believe they are pretty competent to this end, even exclusive of other deficiencies not yet paid up or drawn for. If therefore one State takes in more Certificates than the quota thereof to the 1st of March last, the surplus must be paid to such state in cash from another state which takes in less or perhaps none; or from some other fund, so that the public measures may move in conformity with one another, and it is to be remarked by the way, that though the present mode is one attempt to pay off the public debts, it ought not to be looked upon as the only means, for those which are not satisfied in this way must be paid in money.(3)  It seemed absolutely necesssary that these Notes or Certificates, as the Provision extends both to the manuscript and printed, should be received only from the Persons to whom they were originally given, because the destructive Inconveniences of their circulating as  MAY 26, 1 780  Cash, and being open to Frauds, Impositions and Abuses of many Kinds, were to be obviated. The same caution suggested the Propriety of the Oath or Affirmation. I must however observe here, that if the Legislature find they have, in general, passed from the first Holders, and that the Transaction ought to be countenanced, as far as it has proceeded, it is not impracticable to give the Transferrees an opportunity to pay them in, under the Oath or Affirmation of those named in the Certificates, which might not be attended with bad Effects if confined to Transfers already made. In some Cases, indeed, this would be attended with Trouble, and in others it would be impossible; but I should think comparatively few. The Case of Executours and Administratours would also seem to require particular Attention.  I have not mentioned, what I have often suspected, that where assignments of these Certificates have been made the Purchasers have taken Advantage of the Sellers. Many of them may, perhaps, have been bought with the best Motives; but in such Cases as these the ignorant and credulous are too apt to become the Prey of the designing, and the far greater Number may have been obtained at a shameful and oppressive Discount. I have heard of Paymasters in the Army who, under Pretence of being without publick Money, have offerred to buy Soldiers' Dues with their own, at one Half or two Thirds Value, and put the Proceeds of the Negociation into their own Pockets. I do not say that any of the Staff Officers in the civil Departments of the Army have done such Things, or procured them to be done, for I do not know it. I am well assured many of them are too honest to be guilty of such management, but it is not the general Impression of the People that they are all Saints.  It will be noted that the Resolutions extend only to such Certificates as have been already given; and this will not I suppose, affect our State as the State-Purchasers have now the Business under their Direction, where doubtless a better Superintendence can be exercised, and more Honesty and Economy will take place.  In many Cases the Certificates paid in will be above the Amount of the Tax due from the Person paying them. Therefore that he may have Credit for the Surplus, and have it afterwards discounted, he ought to receive a Voucher as his Evidence from the Collectour, which the Law will particularly check and describe. And by examining the Resolutions of 6 October last, and those referred to, as well as of 5 January and 21 May preceding, (4) it will appear a Matter of Consideration, whether the respective State ought not to be charged with the Interest on that Surplus, because an Interest is allowed to the State on the whole Amount paid in, of which this Surplus is a Part.  It was necessary to except, as in the Proviso, Orders already drawn, because they are generally, if not altogether for similar Purposes MAY 26, 1780  with these Resolutions, to discharge the Debts of these large Staff departments, and also the Requisition of the 19th instt (5) for the express Purpose of putting the Army in a Condition to move, should Necessity require it, or the interesting Event, which we are taught to expect early in this Campaign, take Place.  On the whole of this Matter if the Legislature, upon Consideration of Facts and Circumstances, should find that the Provision made by these Resolutions will avail to the Relief of the People, in the Extent to which they are carried, it will be the more fortunate, as the Object will be attained without deranging other Parts of the publick Measures; but if, as I suspect, they are not adequate, the Legislature, as best able to judge, will determine how far they can be extended compatibly with the other Objects of publick Concern, particularly the Resolutions of 18th March last, and the Exertions of the opening Campaign. Could it be depended on that an Option to the Holders of the present Bills of Credit, to bring them in for Exchange with the new Bills to be emitted, so that the Benefit of the five Millions intended to be raised in the Course of the thirteen Months and a third, by the Plan of Finance lately recommended, might not be lost, would take and operate effectually, much might be ventured. There can be little reason to doubt it, if the advantages of a stable medium are duly considered; but it must also be confessed that no Certainty can be predicated of that which is not only future and contingent, but also depends on the different Ideas of so many different Individuals.  The Amount of the Continental Taxes due from the State to the 1st March last, is five Millions, two Hundred and seventy Thousand Dollars; the Orders drawn, including the Requisition of the 19th inst are to be counted against this; and how far the Balance will be over or under the Remainder of the Taxes paid in, the Knowledge the Members have of the State of the Collection in the different Counties, will enable the Legislature to decide. I have more than once heard it mentioned, that in the Counties where few publick Purchases had been made the Taxes were generally paid up, but that great Arrears remained in the Counties where such Purchases had been principally made and of Course these notes or Certificates given.  It is to be recollected that by the Resolution of 6 March, (6) it was recommended to the State to take Order respecting the Purchases made in Consequence of General Washington's requisition of last winter. Part of the supply then sent to the army, was, I suppose, procured by the State-Purchasers, and Part by the Continental Agents, and many of the Debts yet unpaid will probably fall under the Provisions made by these Resolutions.  I am to inform Your Excellency that we have, as yet, no further Information from the Southward, tho that Charlestown becomes more and more closely begirt by the Enemy. Very little Damage has   been done, but the force of the Besiegers is so vastly superiour, that in the common Course of Events, every possible Effort will be insufficient to check their approaches. The Garrison behave gallantly, and when it comes to the article of storming will it is to be hoped, not be found wanting in that Respect.  I have the Honour to be, Your Excellency's most obedt and very hble Servant, William Ch. Houston  ""

  Dear Sir Philadelphia 26th May 1780 I wrote to you by the Marquiss to which Letter (1) I have not been favoured with your answer. Since the departure of Mr. Mathews nothing material has been transacted relative to the grand business tho' a committee of which I am chairman has made a report thereon which lays on the table.(2) I moved to recall Lees corps but was under the necessity of withdrawing my motion or disgusting all our friends since (as I expected) the eastern people in order to regain their confidence opposed the motion. I am happy that the Genl. has determined upon it since the strongest argument against the measure was the Generals not having recommended it.(3) So that much as he may desire it, it will be impossible to recall the Maryland line except the Genl. shall himself undertake it which I now fear it will be too late to do. Our accounts from Charles town are by no means encouraging, the enemy have brought their approaches to the wet ditch on the 24th. Genl. Lincoln beat a parly & offered terms of capitulation which the enemy rejected with great haughtiness, on which it [was?] determined to defend the place to the last extremity, which is I suppose in other words till the enemy come to their terms. Indeed unless they are hurried by the information they have received I am very fearful that all the galantry of the Garison will not save them. We have made several attempts to bring on the business of Vermont without success,(4) & what will surprize you is that New Hampshire has always voted against us. He (5) tells me that Mr. Livermore has taken away their papers, tho the report we have got upon the subject by no means renders them necessary. Pray mention this to Mr. Peabody & press upon him the necessity of returning unless he means  MAY 26, 1780  to have the vote of the State entered upon the journals of Congress against its essential interests, if he supposes they have any in this controversy.  You will feel with me for poor Morris' misfortune, & will therefore receive some satisfaction in being informed that he is in a fair way of recovery. Present my compts. to the Genl. & the family & the Marquiss. I need not mention the ladies, for they are of course included in remembrances.  I do not know whether you have it still in view to make your preparation towards Canada. If you should an expedient which I mentioned to the Marquiss would give it some complection-The ordering boats to be built to the northward-The sending Arnold to command there since the enemy would naturally conclude that if any thing of that kind is in Agitation he would be employed & if known at Philadelphia they will not long be ignorant of it. If it shd. be inconvenient to him perhaps it might be sufficient to let him be served with an order (with private permission to stay where he is) & in the mean while to make publick preparations for his departure. We have accounts of a very severe engagement between the fleets in the West Indies but nothing from which we can form any other judgment, than that they treated each other very roughly, & made a drawn battle of it.

Should the State agreable to General Washington's Request compleat the regiments to 504, I conceive it will Suffice instead of a new draft, to Convert the 800 men now raising to that purpose, tho probably the Situation of affairs will require they should remain to the Northward. If so-I would advise the State to inform the general  MAY 27, 1780  of it, as I shall be on the Spot & will try to remove any difficulty which might arise.  Letters from Philadelphia announce a Naval engagement in the West Indies between the two capital fleets in that quarter, in which the French Flag was triumphant and drove the British into port. The particulars are not Stated; corroborating advices have also been received from the Eastward, and both wear the Complexion of truth.  A Dangerous mutiny has taken place in a Connecticut Brigade; the Soldiery insist on returning home.(1) It is for the present quelled, but we have too much reason to apprehend that it will shew itself soon and more seriously unless provisions arrive. The Officers live chiefly on bread & water to give the men all they can, and the latter have for ten days past much oftener been without than with any and at no time when that period have they had more than half allowance.

In our letter of the 9th Inst. to Congress,(2) we observed That, if the spirit of discontent, which then prevailed among the Soldiery should fully establish itself, It would be productive of the most serious consequences. The causes which contributed to the first rise of dissatisfaction continuing, have increased & ripened into mutiny. Two  MAY 28, 1780  entire regiments of the Connecticut line, paraded on Thursday Evening with their arms, accoutrements, & packs, intending to march off, & return to the State. They complained of inability any longer to endure the torture of famine, & the variety of distress they experienced. On this serious occasion the Officers displayed a wisdom & prudence, which does them honor. Their exertions reduced the disorder to bounds of moderation, & the Soldiery were prevailed on to desist from intentions, as injurious to their Country, as derogatory to their honour. They retired to their huts, with passions cooled down indeed, but with evident signs of discontent, & Chagrin, & left their Officers with the painful reflection, that a repetition of similar distresses was only wanting to compleat a scene, which they cannot contemplate without horror. The brave, Patriotic & virtuous band of Officers, in every line, had already given up their rations to the soldiers, & submitted literally to bread & Water, as their only sustenance. By this scanty fair, they continue to set an example to, & keep the Soldiery in tolerable temper. But with tears in their eyes (such as men who fall for the distresses of their Country may shed without pusillanimity) they stated their apprehensions, that the dissolution of the army was at hand, unless constant supplies of provisions at least were kept Up.(3)  Persuaded, sir, that to be silent on such occasions, would be criminal, We will address our Compeers with Decency, but with Freedom. We will advise them, that something more is necessary, than mere recommendation, or they will lose an army, & thereby risk the loss of an Empire. Times & exigencies render it sometimes necessary for the governing power to deviate from the strict lines of conduct which regular Constitutions prescribe. And when such deviation is necessary for the preservation of the whole, It is incumbent on rulers to put themselves on the Judgment of their Country, to stand acquitted, or condemned by it. Such times, such exigencies, such deviations, have heretofore taken place-They are marked on the Journals of Congress: And the honest Patriot reflects with gratitude that there were men who at all hazards dared to save their Country. We intreat Congress seriously to consider Whether such times & exigencies do not now exist. If they do, shall Posterity say, that those who directed the affairs of America, at this era, were less intrepid, more attentive to personal consequences than their Predicessors. Heaven forbid the thought! Our affairs it is true are alarmingly deranged, but bold & decisive measures adopted, & prudently executed will restore all.

  My Dear Sir Morris town May 28h 1780 The queries which your Excellency has stated, and on which you have done me the honor to request my opinion, are on a Subject so exeedingly Interesting and Important that I feel my Inability to consider It as extensively, as you wish, I shall however attempt to state my Ideas on the Occassion, and to regard It in every point of view I am able.(1)  It seems requisite in order to enable us to determine with any degree of precision when the enemy can be attacked to the greatest \""advantage\"" to take a view of the probable consequences which would result from commencing the operations in the southern quarter, in preference to this.  The enemy continuing in a divided state, and Charles town not yet reduced, we should in All human probability by pointing the Operations to Carolina not only releive Charles town, preserve the Garrison In It, secure the Southern States, But damp the hopes of the disaffected, Increase the Confidence of our friends in every part of the Continent, and we might even expose the British to the loss of their Army under Sir Henry Clinton. If of all these possible advantages we could only ensure the safety of Charles town and the Garrisson, It would have so happy an Influence on our affairs that I should not hesitate to advise our first Attention to be turned that way, but the Objections which present themselves to such a measure appear to me many, and weighty, and the Obstacles, If not Insurmountable, yet seem not far from It-permit me to State them.  The French Armament will probably arrive at an Eastern port, the sick, the Stores, not Immediately necessary, and the whole of the troops must I conceive be debarked there If a Southern Expedition is to take place, because the transports will require to be fitted for .the reception of such troops of ours as It would be necessary to reinforce the french with-for the horses for the use of the Artillery this with the reembarkation of the troops, the horses, the necessary MAY 28, 1780  forrage and water (supposing all to be previously procured) would together with other Incidental delays take up considerable time, let us suppose three weeks, as much more time would probably Elapse in Compleating the voyage to Carolina, hence It would bring us to the Middle of August before the fleet could reach the vicinity of Charles town (If the French force arrived by the first of July on this Coast) without making any Allowance for delays, which the fleet may experience In the voyage to Carolina, from the danger of the seas, or by falling in with a British one. It may therefore I think be fairly concluded that before the Armament could reach the point of destination, The town must be reduced and the Garrison captured, or the Siege be raised. Let us now suppose the two first of these Events to have happened, and Sir Henry Clinton with his Army still In that Country. In this case I conceive we could not reasonably promise to ourselves Success, Either In an attempt to recover the town, to operate against the british in Georgia, to Attack their army, or to destroy their fleet. 1st. Because I apprehend we could not reinforce the French troops with more than five thousand of our own, If with so many, for altho we might with Considerable exertion send a Competent Supply of flour, as we have no Salted meat, as none can be cured until October at soonest, and as Live Stock cannot be Conveyed thither, they will fail In provision, unless the Country can afford a Supply and that would be too precarious to rely on from a Country at least partly In the Enemys possession and which at best I believe is not well Stocked. 2dly. admitting every difficulty on the score of provisoins Obviated; The force I have Stated, I conceive would not be equal to the reduction of Charles town, If covered by the British troops now there, nor even to that of Savannah as the enemy may speedily march to its relief. 3dly. Granting that the Combined force had gained a footing In the Country, and where In such force as to face the Enemy In the field Yet he will in that case probably take such a position as would render an attempt to dislodge him exceedingly hazardous, If not Impossible, Especially Strengthened as he will be by the disaffected; nor would their fleet be in danger as their frigates and transports would be In the Harbour of Charles town, and their Heavy Ships have In all probability left that coast as being of no use there.  Let us next take a view of our prospects. If when our force arrives In Carolinas Charles town should be reduced, a Garrison left there and another in Savanna, and Sir Harry at New York with the remainder of his troops, then as Our force here would be Incompetent to any Offensive operations we must Content ourselves In this quarter to those merely defensive, and the whole operations of the Campaign will be reduced to An attempt for the recovery of Charles town or Savanna, uninformed of the Situation and strength of the latter I cannot guess at what might probably be the Event of an Attack upon It but If It be fair to draw a conclusion from the difficulties which the british with   a well appointed Army and probably in force equal to any we could send, experience the Siege of that place, we shall not have much reason to believe that we could reduce It and that too at a more unfavorable Season of the year, when Storms prevail which would expose the Ships on an open Coast, to much danger.  If the siege is raised and the british retired to N York, then we shall have no Object to the southward but Savanna and that would then be too Inadequate an one to Claim our attention so far, as to send a force from hence unless we should find ourselves unable to make an attempt on N York.  But after all It is possible that affairs may be In such a posture when the french fleet arrives, as to render a southern operation apparently Indispensible, both because It would probably best promote the Interest of the States in General, eradicate the Idea which has prevailed In the more southern states that they were neglected, and because It would Immovebly fix that confidence which the States and all orders of men in them so justly place In you, and which It is so essential to the true Interest of this country should not be diminished. I will state the possible case-If Sir Henry Clinton from Personal Considerations should be Induced at all hazard to expose the british In this quarter, after having been advised of the Intentions of France in our favor, or If relying on naval assistance from England for N York, he should Obstinately persevere in maintaining the Siege of Charles town, things being thus Circumstanced when the french fleet arrives on the Coast, I think It should be directed to proceed to Charles town with every possible degree of dispatch, for altho the french troops Joined to our troops In that quarter might not be able Essentially to Injure the Enemy In the field, yet It is more than probable that they would be obliged to raise the siege and the town and Garrison be secured to us-directions would In this case be given to the fleet, If advice was received during the voyage to Carolina, as that the siege was raised, or the town reduced, Immediately to put back and attempt to gain the bay of NYork, before the british could arrive. I take many liberties my Dear Sir but as they proceed from the best affections of the humane heart, your goodness and your Candor will be my best apology.  If then It should be deemed Ineligible to commence our operations In the Southern quarter except Impelled to It under the Circumstances last stated, there seems no other object within these states worthy our attention but N York, and the Conduct to be Observed in Operating against It is next to be considered. In doing this I shall premise that the force you have stated as necessary is really drawn into the field and that the supplies are adequate to their support, that the fleet makes the American coast west of N York.  As the success of the Enterprize against N York would be almost reduced to a Certainty If the fleet was In the bay of New York And MAY 28, 1 780  could maintain Itself there; If therefore It arrives at any of the Southern capes, I would advise that their store ships (I mean those that convey such stores as are not necessary in the operation) should push into Delaware, and that the Ships of war And the transports should without a moments delay push for the hook, and that the former Should Immediately after attempt the passage Into the harbour. If they succeed and the british not have left Staten Island when the fleet gets In, they will probably retire by Bergen Point and Cross to New York under cover of the batteries at Powles Hook-but least they should remain on the Island with a view to oppose the french troops It may be necessary to draw a body of our troops to such a position as that they may be Speedily thrown on the Island In order so to divide the Enemies force as that the french troops may debark without risque. Having gained the bay, and the british either relieved from Staten Island or be reduced on It, the next necessary step seems to be to gain footing on Long Island. It would not I believe be prudent to suffer the French troops to land on Long Island unsupported by ours as they might experience a defeat. It therefore appears necessary that they should be reinforced on Staten Island with so many of ours as would make them at least equal to the Enemys whole force; or that a body of ours should be previously thrown on Long Island from Hellgate or Its vicinity-but as the Enemy can so easily combine all their troops either on York or Long Island, It seems necessary before either the french or any of ours land on the latter, that we Should have gained York Island or secured the communication by Hell Gate, and perhaps It would be prudent to attempt this with the whole of the American force, and Even to approach the City, Invest It, and fortify our Camp; If footing can be gained on York Island and afterwards make the detatchment for Long Island-here It is a question If It would Still be prudent to suffer our detatchment and the french troops to land at two different points on Long Island as one or the other might be attacked by half at least of the british force, If it should be deemed Imprudent then Circumstances must determine, wether our detachment should Cross Into Jersey and Join the french on Staten Island to proceed from thence to Long Island, or If the latter should by the way of Jersey come to York Island and the whole proceed thence to Long Island, I say circumstances must determine on the propriety of the one or the other of those movements, as the enemys position on the Island may be, or our means of conveyance enable us.  As the French fleet would be exposed to a disaster If the Superior one of the Enemy should approach whilst we were operating against N York Every possible precaution Should be adopted to prevent the Enemys Shipping from forcing their way up. How far this may be Effected by throwing obstructions In the Channel, and by land Batteries to aid the men of war I am far from being able to determine,   having only a very Slender knowledge of the Country & the waters in that quarter. At any rate It appears to me prudent, if practicable, that the transports after having discharged the Men and necessary apparatus, should retire Either to Delawar or Providence.  If the french fleet should arrive at an Eastern port, I conceive It advisable after having debarked the Sick that It should proceed to the Hook with every possible degree of dispatch leaving the transports to be disposed of in manner hereafter to be mentioned, for If they attend the fleet Its arrival at the Hook will be retarded by the necessary attention to the transports; they may meet a British fleet and the Incumbrance of the transports may prove very detrimental, they must In attempting to gain the bay of New York probably leave some Ships without to protect the transports and thereby their Acting force will be diminished. The delay in coming round with the transports may give time for a British fleet to arrive and Should Even an Inferior one heave In sight whilst the fleet and transports are off the Hook, a penetration Into the harbour will hardly be attempted; I am aware that these Objections to attempt going In with the transports Militates against what is recommended In the preceeding paragraph, but there appears no Alternative; for the transports In that case, must Either proceed with the fleet into the bay of New York or at least to within the Hook, or the whole fleet must go to Rhode Island, for I conceive the Admiral would not risque the Transports by themselves, or even under Convoy of his Frigates only; If the whole fleet proceeds past the hook to Rhode Island It is probable three weeks will Elapse before they can return as they will probably be under the necessity of watering at Rhode Island, and If In the Interim the British Naval force at N York Should be reinforced, It might be Impossible to Obtain the bay of N York with the French fleet. If then the fleet arrives at Rhode Island and the Ships of war only go round, the transports under Cover of the French and Such frigates of ours as we can collect might proceed up the Sound, and the troops be landed at New Haven, and the other western ports In Connecticut, after which to retire to New London or Providence. This mode of debarking The french troops will of necessity Induce another disposition of Your force to Commence the operations. Perhaps, It would not In this case be unadvisable, to Combine the whole of the French and American forces In Westchester County, towards York Island, forming a line, from Hudsons River to Westchester town. In this Situation If the Enemy on York Island Should appear disposed to dispute Your passage across Haerlem River, and It be deemed too hazardous to make the attempt In their face, A fortifyed Camp might be occupied In the Vicinity of Hell Gate, and a force Equal to the whole of the British thrown on Long Island, to Invest the fortifications at Brooklyn, then on the point of being Invested will probably Induce the British to quit the northern parts of York  Island, If so the troops In Westchester will Cross Haerlem River and take post on the Island either on the Heights above Haerlem or approach the City to Invest It, as they may be In force or not, I have hitherto Supposed that Your force will be Equal to an operation against Brooklyn and the City at once, If so this would Accelerate the reduction of Both-but If not; and If your force on York Island is too weak to Invest the town, I would then advise that the Communication with Long Island by Horns Hook or Turtle Bay should be well Secured and part of the troops from Long Island be made to Cross to York Island, or visa versa, as Circumstances, which will be better ascertained on the Spot, may direct. But If the Enemy Should retire Into their works In the vicinity of the City as soon as you Appear in force on the North side of Harlem river, I think It would then be advisable to proceed to York Island Immediately and with the whole force Invest the City, and strongly fortify a Camp, before any detatchment is made to Long Island.  The Events which have taken place Since I was honored with Your Excellencys Queries have Superceeded the necessity of what is observd in the former part of this letter(2) on the Subject of the Southern States, and also of answers to some of the Queries that do not relate to that quarter. The Estimates given to Congress & the States have been Explicit as to the number of Troops you ought to be furnished with to give a full prospect of Success In a Cooperation with the French Naval and Land force. I am Still of Opinion that number is necessary, altho there are Considerations which induce me to advise that the attempt Should be risqued with 30000 men Actually Employed In the sieges, provided that two thirds of them are regular troops.  I wish I had been more Equal to the subject, and more Capable of Expressing myself with propriety and perpiscuity on It-this want with every error in Judgment Your Candor will make Allowances for.  You have an arduous Campaign Opening on you. It is the duty of Every Good Citizen to afford you his aid, and I do most Earnestly Intreat you, to lay your Commands on me; without the least hesitation and on every Occasion In which you may think I can render you A Service, and be assured that I will Strive to Execute them with that Alacrity which the warmest Affection & Sincerest Esteem is capable of Inspiring.

  Dear Sr, Morristown May 30th. 1780 I do my self the Honour to address your Excellency at a time when the fate of these United states are pregnant with the most alarming events that ever attended them since the commencement of this Unnatural War. And was I to remain silent I should think I justly deserved the Curses of every Freeman in the state that sent me forward. I asure you upon my Honour the following narative is drawn from facts stated by his Excellency Genl Washington Confirmed and avowed by Genl Green and the Committee from Congress with which corresponds my own observations for three days past.(1) That from every enquiry and observation that I have been able to make they all so far corespond as to authorise me to declare officially that the Circular letter from the Committee of Congress contains impartial representations of the distresses and imbarresments the Army labour under. Since which the Commander in Cheif hath had the Mortification to se[e] Two whole Regts. from the Conecticut line parade with their arms, packs &c determined to leave this land of Misery, disband and return home. Had it not been for the timely exertions of a number of officers (who have done great honour to themselves) it is more than probable the matter would have become serious and the whole Troops marched off the ground.(2) His Excellency is still under the dismal apprehensions that the moment is not far distant when such an event will take place. In a word the imbarrasments under which the Commander in chief now labours is of such a complicated, distressing nature that they could not be borne by a less exalted Soul. I want words to express the feeling manner in which he  MAY 30, 1780  represents his distresses and his fears of the Countrys being subjugated to the power of Britain. The Committee from Congress appear to be no less alarmed. Every appearance bears a complection at this place sufficient to convince every thinking man that nothing can save us from distruction but a spirited exertion in the several states and drawing forth the rescorces of the Country, for which I cannot doubt the state of Rhode Island, makes her utmost efforts. But when I take a view of the Civil policy of the several states in the union I almost dispare of being able to make any vigorous exertions untill there is a power vested in some man or number of men obliging and binding on all the states in the Union, as it will be impossible to convince the several Legislatures of the Necessity untill the happy moment is past, of which I trust you will be satisfied when you are informed a principal (3) state (to say nothing of the monthly Taxes) hath not yet paid their proportion of the Sixty Million.  I must take the liberty to desire you to use your influence that one of my Coleagues may Come forward as I am fully convinced the important business now before Congress will far exceed my abilities.

It is to be lamented that we were not furnished with better Estimates at first; but we must endeavour to correct the Error; and to face every difficulty with firmness: and to remedy it as speedily & effectually as possible.

When assurances had been given by Congress to France of an Effectual Cooperation with any force she might send, when not a single Adequate Step had been taken to bring the promised number of troops into the field, or to Supply them properly, when Congress was Informed that the armament from France was Actually ordered hither when they had every reason to believe It would arrive here by the last of June, It seems unaccountable that they should not have taken bold and decisive measures to have preserved the honor and promoted the Interests of this Country. What have they done? They have appointed a Committee (2) with powers not to draw forth the resources but merely to apply to the States for those resources, And  MAY 30, 1780  yet Members of Congress have held up to the Minister of France, to the Marquis de la Fayette, and are propagating thro out the Country, that their Committee have the most ample powers to enable to Supply every want of the Army and to put Into a Condition to act with vigor and Efficacy, surely this is Injurious and putting the Committee into a very disagreeable predicament. I foresee the Consequences. The supplies will be Inadequate, the Country will be uneasy, fault will be found, and the Committee will be made the Scape-goat and loaded with Calumny. Indeed I am an unfortunate Mortal. I had retired from public life sore with the wounds I had received In It. I have been drawn Into again, to experience a repetion of distress and heart corroding cares. I do not however Intend to dispair. I will do all I can, I will exert every faculty, I will do my duty, and doing so I shall at least experience the Comfort of an approving conscience.  You have appointed a Committee to Confer with the Minister on the subject of Supplies for the French Troops.(3) Mr. Corny has shewn me his Instructions, and what passed between him and Gen. Greene on the Subject, he has probably advised you of the Conversation he, the Marquis and I had in Consequence. I think It would be for the honor of these States as well as for their Interest that no Public officer of ours should Interfere in any purchases-that the most Capable man that can be found should be recommended to the Minister- that this person should direct the whole Business of purchases, and of transportation, and In General whatever may be necessary for the Accomadation of the troops of our ally. Let this person be a man who has a Character to preserve, and of such rank in life as to Intitle him to the respect and the Confidence of the French Commanders. If the Business is to be done by the deputies In the Staff departments of our Army they will be guilty of pettinesses and little chicane that will reflect dishonour [on] us. The troops will be III supplied, The Commanders Chagrined and disgusted, and unfavorable Impressions will take place; I am not Singular in these opinions.  The Enemy at New York are from good Accounts about 8000 regular troops, 4500 Inrolled Militia and refugees, with Sir Harry Clinton about 8000, In Canada as far up the St. Lawrence as Oswegatchie about three thousand, this Includes the Garrison at St Johns and the Smaller posts on Lake Champlain.  Sir Harry Clinton is advised of the Intended Reinforcement from France. He will probably, as soon as Charles town is reduced, which Indeed I take for granted It already is, return to New York leaving the least Garrison possible say 2500 Men, and that he has lost by death, sickness, &c 1000 more. Since the British at N York will amount to 17000, against a force so Capital and well Covered with fortifications, Every attempt will be fruitless unless we can operate against them with at least double the number. Can we draw that Into field, can we supply them If we should. I fear, I fear we can do  neither the one or the other. We cannot Attempt the recovery of Charles town; the french force would be Inadequate; and we cannot make a detatchment because we have no salted meat and the Live Stock cannot be sent, And It would be too Imprudent to depend upon the precarious supply of the Country. Where then can we point our Operations, to Penobscot, that does not seem an Object of Sufficient Importance, Niagara we cannot approach In this Campaign unprepared as we are, and the Enemy have no other posts, within the united States, and beyond them It seems by the resolutions of the 20th May and those of January, that the General cannot point any operations. Is it wise thus to limit him? (4) If we cannot reduce the first Object N York, should we not Attempt the Second? I think we should, the reduction of Canada is Important. It secures the whole chain of fronteer down to Virginia, enables you to Act with more vigour on the sea board, The temper of the Canadians affords you an Almost Certain prospect of Success-five thousand men In addition to the french force would be amply Sufficient, and these, If the States have the Exertion to Compleat their battalions as the General & Committee have proposed they shoud, could be spared from an army here to act only on the defensive. Why then If we should discover the Imposibility of operating with any probable prospect of success against N York, should we not adopt the only Alternative which Seems left, If those who think like me on the Subject mean to Attempt an extension of the Generals power? It might be well to point In their arguments at Halifax as an object. This might Induce the Eastern members to Join in extending the powers of the Generals.  Measures have been adopted to turn the Enemies attention to Canada but they will not succeed for they will obtain the knowledge that our operations are to be confined to these states. The secret cannot be kept, large popular bodies are equally Incapable of Secrecy as of dispatch.  Colo Sheburne (5) whose regiment is reduced wishes to go to Hyspaniola as Consul or Mercantile agent. Wether such an Officer is to be appointed or not, It may be well to mention It to General Cornel, he wishes It, and I have promised to mention the Matter. A little Management will attach him to you.

  In Committee of Congress. Sir, Morris town June 1st. 1780.  The commander in chief has laid before us letters from General Howe commanding at West point,(1) and from the commissaries at that post and those depending; from those we have the mortification to find that there is not a days provision in the garrison of any kind, that that which had been lodged in the redoubts, and the most positive orders given to preserve it for the subsistence of the garrison in case of an attack from the Enemy, has thro' necessity been also expended.(2) It is exceedingly improbable that the Enemy should be ignorant that the garrison now subsists from hand to mouth, and as they have the highest inducement to attempt a reduction of that post, we ought to suppose they will; (Indeed private intelligence has been received that the[y] contemplate it) as soon as the troops from Carolina arrive, and they are hourly expected. Should they gain it, the consequences would be distressing in the highest degree; permit us to state one. The French force is expected to arrive in an Eastern port, to co-operate with them against New-York or any other point ours must of necessity cross Hudsons river, hence if the Enemy is in JUNE 1, 1780  possession of the fortresses in the highlands as the quantity of flour east of Hudson's river is so amazingly inadequate to the supply of such an Army as we ought to bring into the field, we should have to convey it, from the Delawar by the circuitous route of Sussex County in this State, thro' Orange and part of Ulster in that of New York, thence by a long land transportation to the point of operations, but all the carriage that could be collected, would be incompetent to the business. And if even a sufficient number could be obtained, yet the forage on the rout would be exhausted before the Army could operate offensively. Thus every prospect of makeing an impression on the Enemy in this campaign, must vanish-the succour of our ally prove rather a misfortune than an advantage-the disaffected encouraged, and a spring given to their hopes, if even the result should not be more fatal. It therefore becomes indispensibly our duty not to lose a moment in furnishing that post so amply as that the garrison may maintain itself, until this Army can march to its relief. Your exertions, Sir, and those of the State over which you preside, we are no strangers to, and we note with confidence, that they will be evinced on this occasion, both in a supply of salted and fresh meat, the former cannot be dispensed with in a seige, as cattle cannot be maintained in the redoubts which cover the capital fortress, nor be thrown in if the Enemy should invest them.  We have to intreat your Excellency to keep the substance of this letter, as secret as possible, least the Enemy should take an advantage before the supplies can be thrown in.  We have the honor to be, With perfect Esteem and respect, Your Excellency's Most obedient Hble servts. Ph. Schuyler  Nathl Peabody (3) ""

  In Committee of Congress, Sir, Morris Town, 2d June, 1780.  In a letter of the 31st Ultimo, from the Commander in Chief,(1) which we had the honor to receive on the same day, his Excellency observes, \""That in the expected co-operation with the force of our ally, against that of the common enemy, it is of great moment that we should proceed with circumspection, and on the surest ground. Before we can determine what ought to be undertaken, we should be able to appreciate the means we shall have it in our power to employ, on some precise scale.  \""To begin an enterprize against any point in possession of the  JUNE 2, 1780  enemy, on a general presumption of sufficient resources in the country, and proportionable exertions in the respective Governments to bring them forth, would hardly be justified by success-could never be defended in case of misfortune, to say nothing of the fatal consequences that might ensue. It appears to me necessary to ascertain the number of men, and the quantity of supplies which the states are capable of furnishing in a given time, and to obtain assurances from them, founded on experience of their continuing supplies in the same proportion. I esteem the plan adopted by the Committee in their Circular letter, an extremely good preparatory one: but I think it of indispensible importance, in the next place, to come to something fixed and determinate. I therefore take the liberty to submit to the Committee, the necessity and propriety of calling immediately upon the states for specif c aids of men, provisions, forage, and the means of transportation.\""  His Excellency next states the enemies number, and position- mentions the points against which the combined Arms will probably be directed, and furnishes us with an estimate of the force which America ought to draw into the field, with others, exhibiting a state of the provisions, horses, carriages, and a variety of other articles indispensibly necessary to give vigor and a probable prospect of success to our operations. Duty and inclination equally impelled us to a conference with the General, and to the most serious consideration of the subject. The result was a determination specifically to apportion to, and request from the states referred to in the resolutions of Congress of the l9th Ultimo to furnish the requisite supplies by the first day of July.(2) In estimating these, we have paid all possible regard to the probable resources of each, and to their relative position to those scenes of operation, which are at present in contemplation. We shall accordingly annex the kind, and quantum of supplies which are monthly expected from your state; and we have to intreat that you will fully comply with the requisitions, we have the honor to make, and that they will be kept up, in the same proportion until the last of November, if necessity should induce us to continue the application to that period, even although any of the articles now called for, should exceed the quota assigned you by the Act of Congress of the 25th of February, last: And you will please, Sir, to signify to us, without delay, the determination of your state on this important subject.  Here it becomes our duty to advise you, as upon examination you will perceive, that we have stated your quota per month, in some articles, beyond what it would have been, could we have strictly adhered to the proportion on which the allotments made by the act of the 25th February last were adjusted; but this was found impracticable, because of the exhausted condition of some of the states, in which the Army, and its principal detachments have wintered. But   as these, in the course of the Campaign, will be enabled to afford more than they can at present, your quota as now stated, will of course diminish. The requisition, Sir, is large, but it is barely competent-It is the least adequate to the intended operations, as it is calculated on the most limited expenditures, without the smallest allowance for accidental losses, or extra-consumption.  Having given the states a fixed point, to regulate themselves by, their measures will be equal to it, and their exertions competent to the magnitude of the object. In matters of such high import, it appeared to the General, and to us, essential that there should be a proper understanding on all hands. That the states should know the wants of the Army, and what is expected for it; That the General and the Committee should be clearly and explicitly advised of their abilities, both individually, and collectively; and to have determined with precision, what may be expected. We do not fear to discourage by the largeness of the demand, as we conceive it impossible they should not bear with the knowledge of the wants of their Army, and because knowing them, we are persuaded, their wisdom and patriotism, will impel them to every exertion, fully to afford the supplies. (Thus far Circular)  1st. To New-Hampshire. The supplies apportioned to your state, are as follows,166,835, pounds of beef per month, and 25 Hogsheads of Rum per month, to be transported, and delivered where the commissary general shall direct; also 150 horses to be attached to the Army, and to be delivered where the quarter master general shall direct, and on or before the first day of July next.

Virginia. The supplies alloted to be furnished by your state, are, 60,000 pounds of bacon, in three equal parcels, monthly, to the last of September, and 60 Hhds of Rum per month, to be transported and delivered where the commissary general shall direct; also 29,714 bushels of grain for forage, per month, to be transported to and delivered as the quarter master general shall direct. The first monthly quota of supplies to be delivered by the first day of July next, and the subsequent ones monthly, within the months succeeding, as the quarter rnaster or commissary general may direct. The bacon is an additional Article to those stated in the Act of Congress of the 25th   of February last, but the requisition on your State, as on others, for extra-supplies, could not be dispensed with, and the amount thereof, together with the transportation of any, must be charged in account with the united States. We have not apportioned to your State any flour, beef, salt, or hay, as we were apprehensive that calls might be made on you from the Southward, should that not be the case, you will forward as much beef, and flour, monthly, as will amount to about a fifteenth part of the quota assigned you of those articles by the act of Congress of the 25th of February last. What follows, is circular. We believe it would be advantageous to the States in general, that the carts, oxen, and horses, should be procured by hire, in preference to purchase, as the drivers who will then accompany them will be more careful of the cattle; should your State adopt that mode, we recommend that the contracts may be made, payable in specie, or in paper money equivalent, and that the value of the carts, waggons, oxen, and horses, should be appraised on oath, and a return of the appraisement be made to the quarter master general.  As the object against which the military operations will be directed cannot be positively ascertained, we have it not in power to call on you for a determinate quantum of transportation, but believe it will be considerable.  The continental troops already engaged, and with the Army, together with the addition requested by the generals letter of the 25 ultimo, to complete the batalions to 504 rank and file, will still, in his opinion, and our own, be inadequate to insure success, in the intended operations. In our circular letter of the 25th ultimo, we intreated your legislature to adopt measures for drawing forth your militia, on the shortest notice. We have now to request that such arrangements may be made, as that your quota of militia, which, with the concurence of the commander in chief, we state at (The number of militia requested from the several states, is contained in the first column of the estimate of supplies, see page 63) (3) rank and file shall rendezvous at the Army, or at such posts and places, as the General shall direct, by the fifteenth day of July next, at furthest, and to continue in service for the term of three months, computing from the day of their arrival at such rendezvous, as aforesaid.  Such of the supplies, herein required, as made part of the quota assigned to your State, by the act of Congress of the 25th of February last, and which it is requested you will transport to, and deliver where the quarter master general or commissary general shall direct, will be receipted for by the Continental officers appointed for that purpose, before either they, or your agents, convey or transport the same beyond the limits of your State. If however such continental officer should not be present, you will give directions, that the weight, or quantity of the articles may be estimated, and an account, or  invoice, transmitted with each parcel. We have to observe, that in the beef requested, hides and tallow are not included, allowance must therefore be made for these, when cattle are sent to the Army. If drivers are sent with the draft horses, and cattle, requested of your State, we wish to have one for every four horses, or oxen.  We have the honor to be, with the greatest respect and esteem, Your Excellency's most obedient humble Servts.  Philip Schuyler, Jno. Mathews Nathl. Peabody P.S. We do most earnestly entreat, that the requisition now made on your State, for the quota of Militia may not be suffered on any consideration whatever, to retard the completion of the Continental batalions, as recommended in our second circular letter of the 25th ultimo; The necessity of that measure becoming daily more striking and important.(4)  ""

  Sir, Philada. 2 June 1780 I take the Liberty to enclose for the Use of the Legislature, The Act of the State of New-Hampshire on the Proceedings of Congress of 18th March last, relative to Finance.On former Occasions I have JUNE 2, 1780  transmitted that of Connecticut in Manuscript, and that of Massachusetts-bay in a Newspaper.(1) From the present, little Assistance can be derived in forming or amending a Bill, the Modes of Taxation in New-Hampshire, and indeed in all the Eastern States, being very dissimilar from ours. It is very effectual for their Purposes, but would be looked upon as loose and inadequate in New-Jersey.  I am sorry it was not in my Power to attend the Commands of Members of the Legislature in Trenton, as I could have wished, while in the State, the Beginning of this Week. I had but three Days being obliged to return Yesterday, and it was well I did, as Mr. Fell is unfortunately ill, so as not to be able to attend Congress. Though I have very few private Concerns to look after, I have been so much absent, and so inattentive to them, that I was obliged to give them a little Time.  As I came through Trenton I heard of a Supplement or Gazette extraordinary of Rivington's figuring upon the Capture of Charlestown. I did not see it, nor have I yet seen it, but verily believe it is a Puff, or perhaps a Part of a Scheme they have lately concerted and laboured with much Assiduity, to foment Discontents and Mutiny in the federal Army. I do not pretend to say no Disaster has happened to the Southward, but can scarcely think they know more of it than we, and if the Town had been taken on the 12th ult. it would have been over Land by this Time. Speculations are not of much Account, but if the Enemy were about to leave New-York, or had heard of the Raising of the Siege of Charlestown, they would play such Tricks.  I shall enquire further into the Circumstances when I attend Congress to-day, and if I can collect any Thing of Consequence, will take the Liberty to communicate it for the Information of the Legislature.  I have the Honour to be, with due Respect, Your Excellency's very obed. Servt. William Ch. Houston  ""

  Dr. Sr.(1) Phila. 2dJune 1780 I yesterday recd. a Letter from Jno. Dawson (2) informing me of his arrival at Boston the 16th ult. and of his delivering your and my Leters to Mr. Swan who very politely received him and promised him every necessary attention. The Letter being wrote the day after his geting to Boston no information could be given of the Expence but he says he will communicate it as soon as Mr. Swan and himself shall be able to make the estimate. No extraordinary advance at the JUNE 2, 1780  first will be necessary on the part of Mr. Swan as Jack writes me he had 500 dols. of his money left and his Horse and Saddle &c to dispose of. I am surprised no more Tobacco has come down as the persons owing it promised it should be down as soon as the Roads were in order. I have written to Mr. Jones about it. A Gazett extraordinary of Mr. Rivingtons was brot. here yesterday giving an acct. of the surrender of Chs. Town on the 12th ult. But from various circumstances the Truth of the intelligence is much questioned. A day or two will clear up our Doubt. Sr. Jno. Johnson with three Companies of Regulers and a party of Indians are laying waste pt. of the Frontier of New York, having burnt and destroyed many Houses and killed and taken many of the Inhabitants and it is said the Enemy are collecting in considerable Force at Montreal with design to distress our Frontier.(3) It is not improbable the Indians united with some British Troops and Tories may be troublesome this Summer in resentment for Sulivans treatment the last year wch. served rather to provoke than destroy or ruin. The engagement between the Fleets in the W. Indies appears to be indecisive and it depends upon another struggle to determine the Superiority. I will so soon as it shall be in my power make the inquiry you desire abt. the Maryland Certificates but believe you may be sooner informed by application from Mr. Carrol than from me. It will I think be difficult to get any of them here. With Compts. to yr. Lady, I am, D. Sr, yr. most obed. Servt. Jos. Jones  ""

  Dear Sir Philadelphia June 2d 1780 I have written several private letters to you since my arrival here,(1)which as they contained matters that I should be sorry should fall into other hands, I could wish to know had been received. If your Excellency has written any acknowledgments of them, they have never reached me.  Mr. Griffin tells me he has seen several letters just recd. by Mr. Bingham from Martinique (2) which give information that three successive engagements have taken place between the Fleets in the W. Indies, the two first of which were indecisive but that the third was so far in favor of the French that the English had gone into port, and left the former entirely master of those Seas: that they were gone in consequence of it to invade Barbadoes, and that the general expectation was that both that Island and St Kitts would speedily be in their possession.  It appears from sundry accounts from the Frontiers of N. York and other N. States, that the Savages are making the most distressing incursions under the direction of British Agents, and that a considerable force is assembling at Montreal, for the purpose of wresting JUNE 2, 1780  Photograph of James Madison  from us Fort Schuyler which covers the N. Western frontiers of N.York. It is probable the Enemy will be but too successful this campaign in exciting their vindictive spirit against us, throughout the whole frontier of the United States. The Expedition of Genl Sullivan agst. the six nations seems by its effects rather to have exasperated than to have terrified or disabled them. And the example of those nations will add great weight to the exhortations addressed to the more Southern tribes.  Rivington has published a positive and particular account of the surrender of Charlestown on the 12 Ulto. said to be brought to N. York by the Iris which left Charleston five days after. There are notwithstanding some circumstances attending it which added to the notorious character for lying of the Author, leave some hope that it is fictitious. The true state of the matter will probably be known at Richmond before this reaches you.  We have yet heard nothing further of the Auxiliary Armament from France. However anxiously its arrival may be wished for it is much to be feared. We shall continue to be so unprepared to cooperate with them, as to disappoint their views, and to add to our distress & disgrace. Scarce a week, and sometimes scarce a day, but brings us a most lamentable picture from Head Quarters. The Army are a great part of their time on short allowance, at some times, without any at all, and constantly depending on the precarious fruits of momentary expedients. General Washington has found it of the utmost difficulty to repress the mutinous spirit engendered by hunger and want of pay: and all his endeavours could not prevent an actual eruption of it in two Connecticut Regts. who assembled on the parade with their arms and resolved to return home or satisfy their hunger by the force of the Bayonet. We have no permanent resource, and scarce even a momentary one left, but in the prompt & vigorous supplies of the States. The State of Pennsylvania has it in her power to give great relief in the present crisis, and a recent act of its Legislature shews, they are determined to make the most of it.(3) I understand they have invested their Executive with a dictatorial Authority from which nothing but the lives of their Citizens are exempted. I hope the good resulting from it will be such as to compensate for the risk of the precedent. With great respect, I am Yr. Excellency's Most Ob & humb Servt  James Madison Junr.  ""

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia, 2d June, 1780. The Want of a competent Representation in Congress to decide on the Business of the Vermonters still continues.(1) We wish however for some intermediate act to check their Career, and it is in the Expectation of such a Measure that Major Hunt is prevailed on to delay his Journey a few days longer.  We had the Honour of writing to your Excellency on the 21st Instant by the post; among other things we mentioned the necessity of our Legislature's providing some fund for the support of their Delegates, and of a speedy remitance to disincumber us from the debts we have already contracted for our Subsistance. Lest that Letter may have miscarried we beg leave to repeat that the Inconvenience of permitting members to draw money out of the publick treasury at their pleasure called for a Check; it was not less improper with respect to the Community than indelicate as it regarded the Applicant. It is true that we gave into the practice but it was not that it ever had our Approbation: general acquiescence only gave it Sanction. At present the publick Exigencies are such as to close the Treasury against the private Wants of even the members of Congress, and we must entreat your Excellency to recommend a suiteable Provision for us without Loss of time. They demand from us £270 Cont. money a week for a gentleman & Servant exclusive even of Table beer, every thing else is in proportion, and exchange 60 for one. We take it for granted that it is the Intention of the Legislature that our Expences should be defrayed and we wish for no more. If we should be asked for an Estimate it is our opinion that the Value of six dollars a day specie will be no more than sufficient. It is indeed a third more than the original Allowance to the delegates of our state: but it must be observed that every Article of Expence to which we are exposed is raised to double it's former price.  We enclose your Excellency a Resolution of Congress to establish the post you recommend; (2) and we hope that it is expressed in the manner you wish and that it will answer the Ends you propose. The general Measures pursued at Head Quarters to oppose the Irruptions of the Indians and British into our distressed state cannot but meet with approbation and produce salutary Effects: But horror and devastation will always mark the footsteps of those dastardly foes; and while no adequate Defence can be provided against the Assassin & Incendiary we must be exposed to feel with inexpressible Solicitude and regret the reiterated Sufferings of our frontier Fellow Citizens.  We are still anxious for the Fate of South Carolina. Rivington by a handbill has made a present of it to Sir Henry Clinton: but the Tale is not credited. JUNE 2, 1780  We shall have the pleasure of writing again to your Excellency by Major Hunt, probably in a day or two. And remain with the highest respect, Sir, your Excellency's most Obedient humble Servants,  Jas. Duane. Jno. Morin Scott.  P. S. Neither of Us have as yet received one Shilling from the Treasury. J.

The letter which I did myself the pleasure to write you on the 11 th of May, you had not received when yours of the 25th was written.(1) In that I advised you that I had conversed with the General on the subject which passed between us before I left Philadelphia; that he appeared undecided on the occasion, I believe because no arrangement was made, for he expressed himself with regard to you in terms such as the friends who love you could wish. When I received yours of the 25th May, I read it to him; he was much engaged; next day he requested to know the contents again. I put it into his hands; he expressed a desire to do whatever was agreeable to you, dwelt on your abilities, your merits, your sufferings, and on the well-earned claims you have on your country, and intimated that as soon as his arrangements for the campaign should take place, that he would properly consider you. I believe you will have an alternative proposed either to take charge of an important post, with an honourable command, or your station in the field. Your reputation, my dear sir, so established, your honourable scars put it decidedly in your power to take either. A State which has full confidence in you will wish to see its banner entrusted to you. If the command at West Point is offered, it will be honourable-if a division in the field, you must judge  JUNE 3, 1780  whether you can support the fatigues, circumstanced as you are.(2) Mrs. Schuyler proposes a jaunt to Philadelphia; if she goes I shall accompany her, and have the pleasure of seeing you.

  Sir, Philada. Sunday 4 June 1780, 12 o'Clock at Noon A Mr. William Finnie, from Williamsburg, in Virginia, is just arrived in Town, and brings the following Intelligence. \""That when he was at Baltimore in Maryland, on his Way to this Place, a Number of Letters came to sundry Persons there, from Richmond, the Capital of Virginia, informing that Charlestown capitulated on the 12th ult.\"" The News is mentioned to come by an Express from Governour Rutledge, of South Carolina, to Congress, who was ordered to call on his Route and deliver Despatches to Governour Nash of North Carolina, and Governour Jefferson of Virginia.(1) This is supposed to be the Reason he has not reached Philadelphia. No Particulars are mentioned. The Speculatours, whose Riders travel Day and Night on such Occasions, generally precede the publick Expresses. By a Letter of 31st ult from General Washington, I find the Capture is credited at Head-quarters. What to say against Report so confirmed, I am at a Loss. The Probability certainly is against us. Nothing but official Certainty remains to be expected. If the Event has taken Place we may hourly expect this, as the Express cannot be far off unless some extraordinary Accident has befallen him. I do not like to believe bad News; but we ought to be prepared for it. The Reflections which first present themselves are, that no greater Stroke has befallen us since the Commencement of the War, and none which has required more active and thorough Exertions to recover and repair it, than this will. It is not said on what Terms the Garrison capitulated, but in all Likelihood, they cannot be more favourable than Prisoners of War. Their Service is lost to us, probably for the Campaign. The JUNE 4, 1780  Finances, evidently mending, will be thrown a-back, and without a speedy Execution of the System of 18 March, perhaps return to wilder Disorder than ever. No Subject whatever requires more Attention, for Money will be more necessary than ever. The Effect upon the Army, as well as upon the People, will too probably be dispiriting, especially at first, but may be directly the Opposite after a little Reflection if the publick Movements can all be made to draw together, and no Chasm or Derangement happen before their Thoughts and Views have Time to collect and accommodate themselves to the Exigency. Bold Counsels are the best in precarious Times. I would submit it to the Legislature whether if their Intelligence turns out Fact, it would not be best to vest the Governour and Privy Council, or a greater Quorum if more proper, with Powers suited to the Cast of the Occasion. The Capture of Charles[ton] and the Arrival of a French Fleet, should it happen, both require it. The utmost reach of the Powers of the State will be necessary in a Model which can be speedy and effective in Execution either to provide against great Evils, or to attempt great Objects. The Legislature of Pennsylvania, which adjourned last Thursday, before this News appeared in any Shape, considering the Greatness of the Crisis, empowered the Executive to proclaim and establish martial Law in Case of Necessity during the Recess of the Assembly, for limited Periods. The Assembly has adjourned to September next. A special Council composed of Members of both Houses might be more agreeable to many, but I say nothing of the Form, only have taken the Liberty to say thus much concerning the Thing itself. A Correspondence between such Body and the Delegates in Congress for the State, might be of great use to the State, should the Legislature be unanimous in adopting the Measure so as to give it weight with the People at large. It also occurs that early and effectual Attention ought to be paid to the State and Preparation of the militia. Great Part of the Enemy's Troops will return to New York immediately on the Reduction of Charlestown, though if they knew their true Interest they would, all leave New York and go to the Southward. In the Event of their coming back, their Disposition to Mischief is too well known to believe they will be pacifick towards New-Jersey. It is not a farsought reflection, that this Disaster, though great, is not Matter of Dispondence: Mortals see not Futurities, and who can say that Heaven does not mean this to precede Something more important to us than it is to the Enemy. Things much more unexpected have happened. The Enemy must commit themselves on the Ocean before they can appear at New-York. Perhaps it is best. History and Experience say, that young Nations, as well as Men, [are less able] than those of riper Age, to bear that Prosperity which is not dashed with some Sharpness of Misfortune. These Things fulfil the Ends of God's  JUNE 5, 1780  government, where partial Evil is general good. We pity our suffering Brethren, but no man despairs of the Republick.

  Sir, Philada. 5June 1780. You will receive enclosed two resolutions of Congress, (1) which have doubtless already gone from the President in the ordinary Course of Communication. But as Papers sometimes miscarry thought it not amiss to repeat them. That relative to Deserters will certainly be of Moment, should any French Troops, or the Troops of any allied or co-operating Power, ever be landed on the American Shores for the Purpose of giving Assistance in the Prosecution of the War. The Laws relative to Desertion will easily be extended to secure and return them. This is not only the Duty of an Ally, but it is our Interest in many respects, and no Objection, that I know of, can be taken to it.  The other relative to the Defense of the interiour Frontiers against the Incursions of the Savages is important to us. I understood, when lately at Trenton, that there was a Bill before the Legislature for embodying a Number of Militia to protect the upper Settlements. That no Hesitation may hereafter be made relative to the Allowance of Continental Pay and Rations, it would be well to take the Step New-York has taken, and obtain the Approbation and Engagement of Congress or the Commander in Chief; either will be sufficient. Every one must be convinced of the Necessity of supporting the Settlements over the Mountain; for if they are obliged to remove, double, if not treble the Number of Men will be necessary to secure the Country against Impressions, and after all it will not be so effectually done in this as in the other Mode. The Post established in Ulster will be of Advantage in the general Protection, and the Legislature will be able to determine in what Degree we may be benefited  JUNE 5, 1780  by it.

  Sir, Philada 5 June 1780, Monday 6 P.M. The Express mentioned in mine of yesterday to your Excellency is arrived. Enclosed you have the most material Intelligence he has brought.(1) Governour Rutledge's Letter, No 1, carries no Marks of Certainty; he grounds upon nothing better than mere report. The Day agrees with the Accounts from New-York, but this might be a Finesse calculated to intimidate the Country, and slacken the Succours. Though the Probability is that the Town is taken, I do not believe the Event happened on the 12th May. Governour Rutledge could scarcely fail of knowing it in four Days at the Distance of 120 Miles, and less still Governour Nash in 13 Days at the Distance of 270. Besides the latter declares he has an Express at George-Town, 60 Miles from Charlestown for the sole Purpose of advising him on the State of the Town. It is obvious to remark how totally unlike that Country is from our own; that Certainty one Way or the other should not be had at so short a Distance after so long a Time. It is not indeed to be doubted that the Enemy command a Range of Country about the Town much more extensive than they would be able to do in these Northern Parts, better settled and the Face of the Country more favourable than to the Southward: but through the same Difficulties I cannot but think Intelligence would find it's Way among us.  It cannot escape Observation that Governour Nash speaks of the Event as doubtful. Many Circumstances certainly have that Appearance. But it can scarcely be expected not to have happened at all, though not at the Time alledged, because the State of the Country shows no Countenance or Promise of Succour to the Town. This is plain from the total Loss of Communication.  To explain one of Governour Nash's Reflections, that from Governour Rutledge's Letter it is fairly concluded the Falling of the Town involves the Falling of the State, I must inform your Excellency  JUNE 5, 1780  that I had not Time to transcribe the whole of either of the Letters, but only extracted the Sum of the Intelligence. Governour Rutledge gives a Detail of less Incidents and Remarks, from which the Conclusion is deduced, and it must be confessed with too great appearance of Probability.  This Catastrophe is indeed disastrous, but it is only a Fall in the Race. The Business is to be up and forward, not to sit still and lament. It is neither politick nor necessary to publish abroad the Deepness of the Loss; it is best known by Piece-meal, and we shall soon have it to the Top of the Flourish from the Enemy. To the Prudence of the Legislature I can however say that betwen 4 and 5000 regular Troops were probably in the Town; near double that number of Arms; Ammunition and military Stores of most Kinds in great Abundance; three fine Frigates with their Crews and Stores in the Harbour, the Town, or sunk in the River; if I am not mistaken some Clothing; and private Property to a vast Amount. I cannot say what Part of any of these Articles were removed before the Town was completly invested; I am doubtful not much. I write thus freely in Confidence, knowing that a prudent use will be made of it.  It is not to be doubted that the Southern States will now rouse and exert themselves. It stands them in Stead not to be idle; but I scarcely think any great Number of the British Troops will remain in that Quarter, and rather that we may expect them back at New York. Better Times may be before us, and gloomy as the Prospect is, it is right to hope that we shall have a Day too in due Season.  I have the Honour to be, your Excellency's very obedt.

  Sir Philada 5 June 1780, Monday 10 1/2 P.M. The bitter Cup of ill Tidings is dashed with a little mixture of a different Quality. Captain Pickles of the Schooner West-Florida is arrived this Evening from Mobile, with Dispatches from General Bernardo de Galvez, who commands the Spanish Troops in that Country, to the President of Congress. They are dated at Mobile the 8th ult. and announce the reduction of that Fort. The articles of Capitulation are inclosed, (1) which with the General's Letter will JUNE 5, 1780  appear in the Paper Tomorrow, and will probably reach your Excellency by that Means before this comes to Hand. The Captain's Information is that the Garrison consisted of 800 Regulars besides Militia; and that General de Galvez was waiting for some Shipping in Order to proceed to Pensacola, which if not speedily and largely succoured must soon follow the Fate of this Fortress, and with it the Province of West-Florida. The Captain's Information will probably be published: what I give you is hastily collected and too imperfect to appear. You will be so good as to communicate it to the Legislature. Hard Times make us willing to improve every little Help to break the Fall of Charlestown, should that be realised.  As soon as authentick Intelligence on that Subject comes to Hand it will be forwarded, and doubtless published by order of Congress.  I am, Sir, your obedt hble Servt,  William Ch Houston  ""

  Dear Sir. Philadelphia June 5th. 1780.  This day the President of Congress received a Letter from Governor Nash, enclosing a Copy of one that he had received from Governor Rutledge; Copys of both I have transmitted to you. (1) From Mr. Rutledge's information, and from a handbill published by Rivington, I fear Charles Town has fallen, & the Troops made Prisoners of War. This will be a severe blow to us if true & there is but a bare possability to lope It Is not so.  I need not have Posted to Phila. in the haste I did, As the business relating to Vermont was the occasion of the Summons. The New York Delegates are impatient to subdue the people setled on the New  JUNE 5, 1780  Hampshire Grants, & who claim a Jurisdiction of their own; (2) but I hope and trust, that Congress have more wisdom than to take final Order in this business, before our independence is established; We have business enough on our hands without carving out more at this time.  I expect to hear from your Excellency by the next Post. The information that I may then receive, will determine me as to the time of my setting out from this place. The State is still unrepresented so that Maryland is without a Vote in Congress. (3)  Congress has not been as yet informed of Mr Jays reception, (4) tho' there is no reason to doubt but he will be received as Minister of the United States at the Court of Madrid. Mr. Carmichael was at that place settling the form of Mr Jays reception.  I expect that the French Troops will be off our Cape in all this Month; but how come Green to Publish in the Maryland Gazette the particulars of the information that was transmitted to you & the Council.

  Sir, Philadelphia 5 June 1780.  The Resolutions of Congress of Fryday last respecting the controverted district of our state were this morning read and have now all the necessary Solemnity for their authentication.(1) We thought it ad- JUNE 5, 1780  viseable to have some Copies printed in order to their being certified by the Secretary and circulated in such manner as your Excellency and the Legislature may judge best. Maryland and Delaware continue to be unrepresented which retards a final determination on the Claim of independent Jurisdiction assumed by the Vermonteers. We cannot, however, entertain the least doubt but that Congress will decide against a usurpation which both in its principles and its consequences has the most dangerous and alarming Tendency. We need not reassure your Excellency that we shall embrace the earliest opportunity to urge forward a hearing: for we have nothing more at Heart than to put an End to this pernicious Contest.  The Fate of Charles Town is still suspended. Governour Rutledge in a Letter to Governour Nash of North Carolina of the 16th of May last uses these Expressions: (2) \""We have accounts so certain that I think they cannot be doubted that on Fryday last Charles Town surrendered; as yet I have received no authentic Intelligence of the Terms of Capitulation.\"" Mr. Rutledge then resided at Cambden about 60 miles from Charles Town. This disagreeable Report seems to be corroborated by Rivington's hand bill; but the total want of official Information or even private Letters from Friends or Foes, on so important an Event and after near a Month from the time it is supposed to have happened stamps it with strong marks of Suspicion. It is only supposing that the Enemy at the time the Iris sailed from Charles Town which was the 17th of May thought it for their advantage to spread a Report of the Surrender, and we can as easily account for its passing from their Lines thro' the adjacent Country to the Ears of Governour Rutledge, as for its being propagated thro' that Channel of Misrepresentation, Rivington's Gazette.  We have the pleasure to inform your Excellency that the Expedition of Don Bernardo de Galvas, the Spanish Governour of Louisiana, against Mobile has proved Successful. The Garrison of Fort Charlotte of Mobile consisting of 800 regular Troops under the Command of Lieut. Governour Durnford surrendered prisoners of war the 8th of May. It is not to be doubted but that the Conquest of Florida will be pursued with vigour and while the British are gratifying their vengeance against the feeble parts of our Country without the most remote Hope of advancing their Interest or their Honour effectual Measures will be taken for forever annexing that valuable Country to the Crown of Spain.  We have the Honour to be, with the utmost Respect Sir your Excellency's most obedient & most humble servants,  Jas. Duane, Jno. Morin Scott.  Reprinted from Clinton, Papers (Hastings),5 :797-99. KC (N: Clinton Papers). Charred.  1 Although Edmund surnett noted that this reference to the Vermont resolutions   \""of Fryday last\"" seemed to indicate that they were given a second reading\"" this day, a more likely interpretation is merely that the June 2 resolutions were printed over the week-end and received a proof reading this morning before Secretary Thomson certified them with his signature.

  My Dear Morris town June 5th 1780 My friend General Arnold Complains that he has not received a line from me since I left Philadelphia. I am however not culpable, and my letters must have miscarried, to prevent the like I take the liberty of Inclosing one to him.(1)  When the Commander in chief afforded the Committee here a perusal of the resolutions of the 20t ult. the necessity of secrecy on the Contents, was mentiond, and I believe no Communications have been made by any of the Gentlemen, nor by the General or any of his family, And yet I find some people here are advised that the Operations are to be confined to the united States, and that If the Minister of France is not Informed of them, he will soon be; what will be Consequences? I fear more favorable to us, I have already in a former letter (2) Observed on the Impropriety of the restriction, and every reflection I make on the Subject convinces me more and more of It. I could point out to you as I have done to the General In answer to some questions which he stated to me on what ought to be the object of the military operations, (3) that they cannot be pointed to the Southward, except in one case and there is not the most distant probability that that will happen, but to transcribe what I have said on the Subject would require more time than I can at present spare. You (have seen) will see our last letter to the States, (4) and the Estimates which Accompany that to Congress of this date, you will observe how vastly deficient we are in what is necessary to prosecute an Enterprize where such a force is required, as is stated In the letters. Is it probable these can be procured under the present circumstances? I really think not, and that restricted as the General is, little advantage is to be expected from this Campaign, Indeed I wish we may not be Exposed to disgrace and ruin.  Webbs regiment wants several Officers, the General will write to Congress on the subject. (5) I wish the promotions may take place, and the General requested to recommend the officers to the vacancy.  Capt. Van Dyke who has suffered so much In New York, who under the severest tryals has abided by and maintained his principles has a claim to our Attention. Let me Intreat my Colleagues to aid JUNE 5,1780  him In procuring some appointment he wishes to be in the naval line, (6) every body about head quarters speaks well, very well of him.

For one that has been a General Officer to Attend the army as a Committe man, when It takes the field, is rather a disagreeable situation, It will be more so when the French troops Join.

  Dear General Philada. 6th June 1780. I am now to answer or rather acknow[ledge] the receit of yr. favour of the 10th Ultimo-as being but a few days here, I shall rather give you a Scetch of present appearances & things to be early apprehended than at present attempt any formal answer to yours.  The French troops (expected to be about eight thosand including Marines) are not yet arived tho' daily expected either into the Delaware Bay, or at Rhode Island-of the Land forces, 5000 effective is said to be the nearest mark, these in conjunction with ours, augmented by Militia to the number of 40,000 men, are thought of to form a Blockade agst. N____ K. This effort if made will try our finances & other resources (I mean provisions, Forage, Waggons &c) to the very bottom___the treasury is already empty or nearly & of  JUNE 6, 1780  the Interest of money lent the publick, not One Shilling can be had! yet it is said that the foreign troops must be employed when they come, and that to decline the Object mentioned above will Set us in a bad point of light with our Allies &c. The Marquis Le Fyett, who is now at Camp, I find is very fond of it. This business in my Opinion cannot be attempted till after Harvest. This morning bro't us the depressive intelligence of the fall of Charlestown, by letters from Mr. Laurens dated at Wilmington which gives the Surrender a greater appearance of truth than former accts had done, yet not fully assertained but as good as granted on all hands. The expectation of the French troops well known to Sir Harry Clinton may favour the residue of Our Southern possessions, by recaling their force to New York.  The demands of the Southern Gentlemen you may be Sure are very urgent upon Congress for farther aid to that Country & the Legislature of Virginia in a late adress hath conjured us to that purpose. What may be proper to be done cannot so well be determined until the reinforcement arive & the farther movements of the Enemy to the South become more evident. On perceiving that a motion wou'd probably be made for sending you to the South-I moved your being Sent for to this City, urging the propriety of every assistance in forming the Arangements of the Campaign &c. From One quarter I was opposed with the immediate necessity of your taking the command of the Southern Militia, with the Maryland line &c. for the defence of those States-this I thought proper to parry for the present, with the approach of Sir John Johnston who is fortifying in that Country, and may have, or expect a much greater force in his rear than the Six hundred which at present appears- the indigested State of our affairs & the light we require from future events-that Baron DeCalb was gone forward &c. So that on the whole the debate produced for the present no more than the revival of a few past transactions, and the good Opinions wch. naturally follow them. In the Idea of Consultation respecting the Arrangements for the Campaign, it was alledged that as the House had a Standing Committee with the Commander in Chief, that must suffice. From these hints you will naturally See, that your call to the field may be Set down as Certain, but the time when, & the place where, as uncertain; it may be in a fortnight, and yet may not be until the Fall.(1) I confess I cou'd wish your presence here & a Visit to the Army might have it's utillity, on the other hand, the errand that at this time wou'd lead a man from his own house as a volentier, ought to be irresistable, the expence & Scarcity of money, being equally indiscriptible! Your intimate friends will however be much obliged by your Sentiments on the business of the Campaign, and also on your Own private wishes, which we know will be governed by the laws of reason, and of Arms. As to Charlestown I'm now obliged to think  we had better compose ourselves and take our next Steps, yet can I hardly be persuaded that Genl. Lincoln, unable to defend the place, will not attempt to get out more or less of the Continental troops either by land or by Water. As to our finance, at Once in the lowest & most delicate Situation, it must wholly depend on the Success of the resolution of the 18th of March last, and therefore the concurrence of the States is of all things to be wished & endeavoured. Pennsylvania, altho' without money has made a vigorous effort not only to rais troops for the Campaign, but to provide a temporary Supply in the Article of Meat for our Army lately starving which is beside the Quota assigned her. It's true the troops are necessary to her immediate defense agst. the depredations of the Indians. Our Merchants have I hear, agreed to give the new money a currency so far as is in their way, and I hope all the States will concur in their Several Laws to establish the resolution mentioned above. I hope you will have other letters by the Doctor-And am Dear General, with my best respects, to your Lady and Major Gates, Your very Affectionate friend, And humble Servt, John Armstrong  [P.S.] I am better pleased with the Simplicity & temperance of the Chevaliers Table than I expected, except the innumerable Sweet Meats & Deserts of which there is a great redundance.  Johnston I believe will be repelled by the York-line of the Army & some Militia of that State gone up for that purpose.  ""

If the contrary should prove to be the case, God knows what will become of us, for I dont find we have any further assistance to Expect from this quarter, unless the French Fleet arrives, which I fear will be too late to be of service to Charles Town.

  Dr Sir June 6, 1780] Major Lee, in the card which you politely handed to me, having referred me to you for an elucidation of what passed yesterday at Doctor Sheal's table,(1) I must now address my self to you on that Subject, which his mistake has, undeservedly, rendered of Some importance, and I am happy that he has made choice of a Gentleman to whom I can with the greatest Confidence Commit my honor.  From the Conferance, which you favored me with this morning, I have discovered, that he has taken Offence at my desiring to refer every thing Serious to a future Opportunity. This I did at two periods with different Intentions. The first merely to elude a Conversation which was Irksom to me and which Major Lee particularly pressed upon me, and which, in my Opinion has already been Continued beyond the line of good breeding.  I wished to Convey no other Idea than, that Serious Subjects were not then well timed, and were never agreeable to me after Certain hours in the day, which were then over, expecting that Such a hint would be Sufficient to remind the major that he ought not to expect me to forego my own disposition for Chearfulness, And to take up his for Seriousness, and I recollect having explained this Intention more fully by this Expression \""Allow me to trifle when it is my hour for trifling.\"" JUNE 6, 1780  The Second was to convey to Major Lee my Sense that if he was offended, I thought the place improper for an explantion, and that I did not chuse, hastily, to give any that I would take a proper time when I could, cooly, consider what has passed and distinguish between captious petulance, and the feelings of a man of honor, for tho' I was and always am resolved to do nothing in Consequence of the former, yet I have the highest respect and most Sacred regard for the latter, and if ever I am so unfortunate as to offend them thro' mistake or Inattention, I hold my self bound by every powerful principle to make attonement. Unconscious as I was of any Intentional offense, the time and manner of the Major's calling on me Suggested to me the former as what gave rise to it, while on the other hand my Esteem for, and high Opinion of him Strongly forbid my entertaining any Such Idea. While my mind was thus ballancing, he used the word serious, and I then assured him he should have as serious an Answer in the morning as he might think proper. (2)  During the first period you were present, and to you Sir, I beg leave to refer whether my words or Manner imported any thing which could be deemed offensive to the most Nice and Scrupulous honor of a Young and gallant Soldier? For I think the Major entitled to every allowance due to Such a Character, which I am extremely desirous of cherishing. If your Opinion be for the affirmative of this Question I then Sir do not Scruple to declare that the major entirely mistook my Intentions which never were to give him offence. If your Opinion be for the Negative, I Shall then decline all Explanations by words, and Shall attend the Major's Summons for any purpose, the most serious that he may wish, agreeably to my promise of yesterday Evening.  As your Opinion shall determin, on the above Question, you have my permission to declare to Major Lee either alternative.(3) And with the highest Confidence in you, I am most truly yr. obt.

But while both are to be ascribed to obvious, nay necessary, Causes it will be vain indeed to repine. To a republican form of Government a Jealousy in confering extensive Authority is natural: and equally natural is it for Men to relax and become supine after long and violent Exertions. However Experience has proved, and I trust it will prove again, and as often as may be necessary, that Distress and Calamity will rouse us to a Suitable display of publick Confidence and private Virtue; and that both cooperating will be abundantly sufficient to enable us to surmount the pressing difficulties which surround us. The Apprehension of the Loss of South Carolina, the real distresses of the Army, and the Insistence of the Enemy, have already had a very considerable Effect on the Legislature, as well as the Whiggs of this State. I am firmly perswaded that they are making great Exertions, that meat may be found here to feed the Army for five or six weeks and that afterwards the Eastern States will produce a competent Supply. I am not quite so easy in my Mind on the Articles of Bread and Pay altho' these I am persuaded may also be drawn forth on an urgent Call, and such a one rings loudly in our Ears. Men and Courage will not be wanting when the Danger or the prospect of Deliverance approach in fuller View. While I entertain these Sentiments I can examine the gloomy side of the Prospect tho' not without pain & Solicitude, yet without being deserted by the pleasing Hope of combating All our difficulties, and rising superior to the Assaults of our implacable Enemies!  But I must defer this Speculation or lose the Conveyance for the Clock strikes four and the post cannot wait. In a word I think I may venture to assure you that no Requisition from the Commander in Cheif which Congress has the Means of complying with will be refused: and, on the other hand, I have no doubt but his Wisdom & - Vigour will point out what is proper. That you will be near to assist him I regard as a fortunate Circumstance.

  Sir, Philadelphia June 6. 1780 By the enclosed paper of this day your Excellency will see the Spaniards are in possession of Mobile.(1) There are no late official Accounts from South Carolina, but from a variety of circumstances there is much reason to apprehend that Charlestown is in the hands of the Enemy & that the Garrison capitulated about the 12 of May.  The war will probably be very serious with us this Campaign & it is to be wished all may duly expect & be prepared for it.  Some of the new bills for Connecticut will I hope be forwarded the begining of next week.(2) What the Eastern States have done on the resolutions of the 18th of March your Excellency is fully informd. Of. N York has adopted the Measure with unanimity & spirit & pledged their forfeited Estates as a fund for their Bills. (3) The Assembly of New Jersey it is said have neerly compleated their Acts for adopting the measure. This State your Excellency will see in the enclosed paper.(4) The Assembly of Delaware are convening again & it is to be hoped will have wisdom & firmness enough to do right. Maryland meets again the 7th of this month. Mr Jenifer a delegate from that State says they will undoubtedly adopt the measure & execute it, as not only the people but a decided majority both in Senate & Assembly approve it. A question arose when their Assembly were last together between them & the Senate, whether the new bills should be a Tendery, on this they grew warm & adjourned. They have probably by this time cooled & discovered that they were disputing about a circumstance not very essential. Virginia Assembly are together & there is every reason to expect they will adopt the measure pretty unanimously.  There is nothing very late from Europe; nor any other particulars yet recd. of the engagement in the West Indies than what is taken from the English Accounts.

The Paper also contains the Act of the Legislature of this State on the Proceedings of Congress of 18 March last. I regret the Suspension-clause, not that I believe any material Injury will arise from it, because the Intelligence from Rhode-Island whose Legislature met the 2nd instt, from New York who met some Time since, from Maryland who meet the 7th inst and from Virginia now sitting, the Measure will soon be adopted in a Majority of the States; but such a Suspension looks dubious, timid and indecisive, and were the same to be done in other States, what would be the Effect on publick Measures!  To this Bill is tacked the Act on the recommendation of Congress of 27th ult respecting Deserters, (2) a Subject which the Legislature will, I doubt not, attend to.  The Paper also contains an Act for producing a Defense on the Frontiers of Pennsylvania, a Subject not uninteresting to us.  And in the last Place some very good and seasonable Advice from a serious Whig.  If I can obtain them from the Office, I will enclose the Proceedings of Congress of Yesterday, recomending to the several States to countenance and assist such as may be employed to procure Necessaries from the co-operating Fleet and Army shortly expected.(3) A Gentleman in the Character of Commissaire de Guerre is now attending to that Business and getting it in a proper Train.  Send you also Extract of a Letter from Connecticut (4) which the JUNE 6, 1780  President has been so obliging as to communicate.

  Dear Sir Philadelphia Jun 6th. 1780 A Vessel from West Florida has brought to the President of Congress intelligence from Govr. Galvez of the surrender of Mobile. No other particulars than those contained in the inclosed paper are mentioned, except the verbal report of the Capt. that the Garrison consisted of about 800 including inhabitants &c. Seven or eight vessels have just arrived from the W. Indies as you will also observe in the inclosed paper but they bring no satisfactory information concerning the late engagements between the two fleets. The Address from the Genl Assembly was yesterday immediately on its receipt laid before Congress and referred to a Special Committee, on whose report it will probably be considered in a committee of the whole.' I flatter myself that the arrival of the French Armament which is hourly expected will place our affairs in a less melancholy situation than their apprehensions seem to paint them. There is little doubt but the conquest of the Southern States was the object of the operations of the present Campain, but I can not think the Enemy will pursue that object at the manifest risk of N. York. It is more probable they will leave a strong Garrison in Charleston, and carry back to N. York the residue of their forces. If they should endeavour to extend their acquisitions in the Southern States, it must proceed from an Assurance from England that a superior naval force will follow the french fleet to frustrate their views on the American Coast. I cannot suppose that however intent they may have been on taking post at Portsmouth, that they will venture in the present prospect to spread themselves out in so exposed a situation.

  Dear Sir Philadelphia 6th Jun 1780 Your favor by Mr. Elting I recd. yesterday afternoon & embrace the opportunity of his Return to answer it. We have been extreamly impatient under the total Silence of all our Friends in Public Office, who if they knew how much Pleasure We derive from their Intelligence would certainly be frequent in favoring Us with a Line or two. Our plan of finance has it seems met with the same fate in our State as in others-reprobated at first out of doors, from the Arts of Speculators; yet when well understood most generally approved; tho' indeed no State but ours has carried their reprobation to such a Height as to stop in any degree the Circulation of the continental Money. The four New England States have legislatively adopted it & sent Us their Acts. I most ardently wish we may soon have the pleasure of presenting one from ours in its favor. The double provision You speak of for funding the Money to be Emitted on the plan I highly approve of. It is the very same I had the Honor of proposing to the Governor in a Letter some Time since.(1) I greive for the distresses of that State which for a thousand Reasons is and ever will be peculiarly dear to Me. I think the Governors presence in the upper part of the Country is highly necessary; and flatter myself that his good Sense & military active Spirit will have salutary Effects; and that the cooperations of our Militia with the New York Line will make Sir John repent of an Expedition so disgraceful to Humanity. The devastation of our frontiers by the Savages I predicted. Nothing less could be expected from their Vindictive Temper. For this reason and the Inaction to which Sullivans fruitless Expedition reduced our Grand Army in the last Campaign I disapproved of that Expedition. We cannot exert ourselves too much to answer the Expectations of our generous Ally; particularly as the strong assurances we gave him by our Communications through his Minister in Janry. last make our utmost Exertions for the present Campaign a debt of national Honor. And tho' in a full Confidence of ample and compleat Preparations on our part, the royal Friend of the American States, is sending a Fleet and Army to our direction, I fear, that, unless We strain every Nerve, we shall become a Bye-word among the Nations and in a great Measure be neglected, if not sacrificed in the ensuing Treaty of Peace.  By your Account of the Means to which our Legislature are to betake themselves for Supplies, one would imagine that the Taxes  JUNE 6, 1780  have not been so productive, as, after paying the drafts on the Treasury to leave any Money in it. If so, surely there must be some capital defect either in the Imposition or Collection of the Taxes which call, loudly call, on the Wisdom & Honor of the Legislature for Correction. The Reputation of our State with Congress, with the Army, with the Minister of France stands foremost in the List. For God sake, for the Sake of Liberty & the hitherto immaculate Honor of our State let us maintain that first Rank; let Us continue to be prime inter pares! Let no Means be unessayed, no difficulty unsurmounted. Tho' I am sorry that there was a Necessity for selling any of the Confiscated Lands so soon; yet I am glad they sold at so good a price. I wish for the future we may be sparing of such Sales; and endeavor to supply our Wants by Taxes.  I forgot to mention to You that the Legislature of this State have also passed a Law in favor of our plan of finance; the preamble to which You have in the inclosed paper, (2) as also another for Supplies. Besides this just before they rose they vested the Governor & Executive Council with most ample powers for rendering the Abilities of this State productive in Supplies to relieve our Army in their present distressed Condition. Their want of Necessaries, as well as the destitute Condition of the posts in the Highlands, are almost daily painted in the most lamentable Colours in Letters from the General & the Committee at Head Quarters. About a week ago two New England Regiments paraded with their Arms, Accoutrements and Packs, and seemed determined to go home or seek a Sustenance by Arms. The Mutiny ran: so high that one of their officers in Attempting to quell it received a Blow. They were however after much difficulty prevailed on to retire to their Tents with a Sulleness & Gloom in their Countenances which clearly expressed that their mutinous Temper was by no Means subdued. And can any Thing less be expected my dear Friend, from an Army who have for Months past lived almost entirely without Meat and been almost seven Months without pay? It is said they are preparing for the Field. But how are they to take the field, without provisions, without a Sufficiency of Tents & Camp Equipage, without horses, or a Sufficiency of Forage if they had them? All these are wanting; not because the Country is destitute of them; but because our Credit & our Treasury are both exhausted. There are I believe Members in the Legislature who know I disapproved of the Address of Congress of Sepr. last (3) and was the only Member who opposed the Republication of it. I was displeased with it because it was calculated to cast the Odium of our Calamities on the States, when it justly laid elsewhere; because it excited most impolitically the Tender Feelings in favor of Widows & Orphans whose Losses should have been provided for in a Special Way, & not by an Appretiation of the whole Currcy. to the inriching of Commissaries, Quarter Masters and Speculators at the Expence  of the Ruin of the Country, by compelling it to pay a debt of nominal Value, by a Tax equal to Specie, and because Congress thereon pledged their Faith agt. New Emissions on the delusory promises of ample Loans and the equally delusory Expectation of a punctual payment of the Quotas by the States. Hence have sprung all our present distresses. Whereas had Emissions been continued, Depreciation which grew rapid by stopping the press, would have continued to be gradual; and even had it attained to 120 for one, the Evil might have been as effectually remedied by our plan of Finance as it now can, and we should have had Money to enable our army to take the Field properly appointed. Congress now see this; and are grown Sick of Addresses. I hope they never will in future substitute the Flowers of Rhetorick in the room of plain unadorned Good Sense; or if they should, I hope those painted Shadows will never more so fatally & successfully alleviate the eager Embraces of the States. We have been taught enough by Experience that Handsome Addresses & Resolutions however agreable they may appear on paper, never make an Army figure in the Field, never vanquish a potent Enemy. They please a while; then vanish,  \""and like the airy Fabrick of a Vision  \""Leave not a Wreck behind.\""  Before I quit the subject of Finance I must tell You, that there is the greatest Reason to believe that the Legislature of New Jersey now sitting will adopt it and that the like will be Done by Virginia whose Legislature is now sitting; that Maryland whose Legislature is to meet in a very few days after having ended their last Session without bringing the Business to effect, because they unhappily connected it with another Subject of great Contest between the two Houses, determined on their parting to separate the two Subjects at their next Meeting, which will be This day week; and that Delaware, tho' their Legislature broke up without doing any Thing with the plan of Finanace, probably waiting to see what the other States would do, will now be ashamed of a Singularity on the Subject. I doubt not but the New Emission will be speedily sent forward to our State. But remember my Friend that it can only issue in a certain proportion to the Money brought in by Taxes, which from the experienced Backwardness in Collection; & the Substitution of Certificates in the room of Money, in our & some of the other States, & the repeatedly necessary drafts on the different Treasurys will disable the issuing of the new Money in such immediate large Quantities as our present critical Exigencies require.  You ask for my Sentiments on the tender Law. Tho I heartily wish my plan could be adopted as to old debts, I have no great Objection to its being extended to debts contracted since depreciation began. The difficulty with Me on that Head is how a Scale of depreciation can be settled. Depreciation has been some Time stationary, some  times less, some Times more rapid, at the same periods different in different parts of the State, & yet it is evident that a Scale of depreciation must be given in the Bill. For if it should only provide that the State of depreciation at the Time of the contracting of the debt shall be the Rule, You will leave to Juries that Latitude which will in a great Measure continue the Confusion You speak of. Another Objection is the impossibility of preventing the Creditor from having the depreciation doubly made good to him. It must be supposed that every Seller on Credit in the price of his Commodity had an Eye to depreciation and by enhancing his price with a View to this, he doubtless increases the depreciation. Nor does Justice seem to require a provision in favor of those who sold with their Eyes open while the Money was depreciating. Add to this it will be impossible to distinguish between debts of a private & of a public Nature. The latter should not I think be provided for but on the Recommendation of Congress; and they are Still undetermined what to do about them. It is well known that Sellers have in most Instances taken a shameful Advantage of the public. And it is matter of great difficulty to separate between those & others-a future provision may be perhaps most prudent. But Justice cries aloud for an Immediate one with respect to old Debts.  We tremble for the fate of Charlestown. We have nothing official which shews it is determined. We fear for the unwelcome Tale every Moment. What We have You will find in our official Letter Directed to the Governor. Some other unofficial Accots. of this day render the Surrender more probable & yet it is disbelieved by Some.  Permit me to close this long Letter with the most earnest Sollicitation for the Honor of the Delegates of the State & for that of the State itself as it is interested in their due Support. We are here without Money & almost without Credit. Not a farthing have I been able to get out of the continental Treasury; nor do I expect any from that Quarter. The Money I bro't from home; & by bringing of which I am sure I have distressed my family, is spent, chiefly in paying for my Board, having bought very little Cloathing, & spent not a farthing in pocket Money. I am now in arrear near two Months for my Board and am dunned for it almost every Morning. Besides this a Common Bill for parlour hire, Liquor, Candles &c. of upwards of forty pounds. This Bill accrued partly while You & Colonel Floyd were here and General Schuyler & Mr Livingston left Me to pay it. But for want of procuring Money from the Treasury I have not been able to do it; and I am daily dunned for it. In short I cannot stand it much longer & must return home if I am not speedily relieved. We in an official Letter to the Governor stated our distresses, increased by the addition of 50 per Cent for our Board. Every Thing is here 100 per Cent dearer in specie prices than in 1774. Our Convention allowed its delegates 4 dollars when Money was not depreciated. We ask only  6 Specie or their Value at 60 for one. We hope it will not be thought unreasonable. I hope an immediate Remittance at that or some other reasonable rate may be made so that I may be Reimbursed for my Support from the 18th of Feby. till this Time and for my future Support. I most earnestly entreat We may not be left in such pressing difficulties.  The inclosed Resolutions we procured as a temporary Relief agt. the disorders on the Grants till nine States exclusive of those interested in the Controversy shall be represented. (4) The Report of the Committee containing those Resolutions was violently opposed & voted agt. by Ellery who is no longer a Member, was voted agt. by Holton & by Matlack a New Member for this State & by Mr Jennifer the only Member from Maryland. The Yeas & Nays were called and the only Nays were Ellery, Holton, Matlack and Jennifer.(5) By the arrival of Mr McKean there are now nine uninterested States. We shall therefore attempt to get a day fixed for a Hearing. (6)  I hope our Legislature will continue sitting till the last Moment in June. The French fleet will probably arrive by that Time; & perhaps something will be wanted further of the State towards the Operations of the Campaign. A most violent Fit of the Fever & Ague obliged Me to leave this Letter unfinished till just now. (7) It is gone off; and I can now with Composure tell You how much & how sincerely I am, Dear Sir, Your sincere friend & most obedt. Servt.  Jno. Morin Scott P.S.

  Sir, Philadelphia, June 8. 1780 The various accounts we have from the Southward still leave it a matter of some doubt whether Charlestown is taken or not; tho' It is now generally beleived to have been safe on the 12th of May, & by many as late as the 18th. A body of the Enemy from New York supposed to consist of 4,000 or 5,000 marched into Jersey the 7th as far as Springfield-some  JUNE 8, 1780  Skirmishing has ensured-whether their object is forraging or attempting the Camp at Morristown, or to make a shew of their force is yet uncertain.(1)  Letters from Martinique, as late as the 13 of May, mention no further particulars of the engagement of the 17th of April than that the English fleet in a shattered condition put into St. Lucia, & that the french fleet with their Troops on board continued out; & it was hoped would be able to effect a descent on some of the English Islands.  A very large quantity of Military Stores & provisions are said to have arrived in the West Indies from France.  We do not yet hear of the arival of the fleet expected on this Coast.  More than 40 Sail of Merchantmen have arrived in the Delaware & Cheaspeak in the course of ten days. Prices & exchange are falling. There has been no depreciation of the currency here for about three months.  Your Excellency will doubtless receive from the President a resolution for advancing in Connecticut a sum of the monies of these United States, (2) when such there shall be not otherwise appropriated to the french Commissary Monsr. de Corny to be replaced in Specie on the arival of their fleet. It is indeed to be wished that the United States had mony at this time in Connecticut & other States, that could be advanced for such exchange, as evident & essential benefits might result therefrom. But at present it cannot be supposed that they have much money in bank any where. This the Minister was frankly informed of before the resolution passed that he might not be thereby disappointed, & that it was doubtful whether there would soon be any considerable mony in the Treasury or Loan office in Connecticut that Congress, would have right to draw for. It is earnestly his wish to do all in his power for establishing the credit of the paper currency-And I will take the liberty to suggest to your Excellency as I did to the Minister, that should the United States not have money on hand that they could so exchange, it might be of publick Utility could such exchanges be made with individual States or persons. He has received of this State £17,000 of their new bills pretty similar to those lately struck by Connecticut, to replace the same in specie when the fleet arives. It would be well if the Specie which the french may bring into the Country for supplies could with their approbation & convenience be placed in the publick Treasuries & their purchases made with the same currency as ours.  Two or three hundred thousand dollars of the new bills for Conencticut will be sent forward on Monday next. If the holders of the old bills should appear desirous or willing to exchange them for the new at their relative value, this might perhaps be effected, under proper restrictions thro' the hands of a public agent or agents who should receive & carry the old bills into the loan office to be de-  stroyed, & obtain credit therefor to the State as part of its quota to be brot in, & who could receive the 6/10 on behalf of the State out of which he could pay over 5/10 or at the rate of 1 for 40 to the proprietors of the bills received in retaining 1/10 for the State. This thought I have taken the Liberty to suggest to the consideration of your Excellency, conceiving it to be immaterial to the United States, what methods, consistant with good faith, any State shall take to expedite the gathering & bringing in its quota to be destroyed. To what lengths it may be expedient for the State to lay open its funds- so that persons possessed of money in other States who should give the preference to Connecticut funds might come in & take the benefit of them to the eventual exclusion of some of its own citizens as the case may be, your Excellency will be most competent to determine.  I have the honor to be, with the highest respect, your Excellency's most obedt. humbe. Servt. Oliv. Ellsworth  ""

  Sir (public) Philadelphia June 9th[1780.] I have the mortification to inform you that the Enemy are parading the Jerseys in great force, at least with six thousand Infantry and the General says with a large body of horse also.(1) In consequence of this movement the Commander in chief requests that major Lee may be ordered to the main army, and I suppose this morning Congress will prevent his proceeding to the southward. (2)  A Committee of Congress who have been many weeks at head quarters with very extensive powers, in concurrence with G. Washington and the marquis de La Fayette, think proper to call upon the different states for a considerable quantity of specific supplies in addition to a former resolution of Congress, and also for 22,000 militia immediately to join the northern army-but whether Congress will send forth the requisitions to the state of Virginia I cannot determine (3)__as the neighboring states will demand your utmost exertions.  I suppose the great plan of finance is already happily executed; indeed the resolutions of Congress should be complied with, as a General scheme-for without unanimity upon these important points our confederation will break to pieces. What ever may have been the opinions of some states in Congress, a large majority of that body ought to be regarded especially in critical times like the present.

But presuming that you are not yet intirely weaned from the things of this world, or unsoli[ci]tous about the great events of a war in which the most contemplative Philosopher may find something interesting, I cannot but wish to make you partake in the pleasure I feel on having at length recd. one contradictory account from the souther'd after so many confirming the loss of Charlestown. The Baltimore paper of the 6th says on the authority of a delegate just arrived, that it was in our hands on the 18th. Mr. Chase in a private letter possitively asserts the same thing. This indeed like the accounts of its surrender stand upon report, but while the one is weakened by, the other derives force from the want of more authentick information.  And now Sir give me leave to assure you that as retirement does not render you indifferent to what passes here, so neither does the bustle of towns make us forgetful of those we esteem in the country, JUNE 9, 1780  And perhaps a philosopher would be more justifiable in being solicitous about the welfare of a friend, than the fall of empires, since the last only fall to rise again under another name while the injuries sustaind by the first may be irreparable.

  Dear Sir Philadelphia 9th June 1780 Every objection that you make to the Limitation of the powers of the commissioners was foreseen before I left head quarters & I mentioned them to you. I knew from past experience the real or affected delicacy of some gentlemen upon that point & the facility with which people are won over to an opinion that flatters their pride. However I have no doubt that upon this great occasion every State will make spirited exertions. The Gent. of this place have agreed to receive the new State money as specie and have set on foot a subscription for filling up the Pensilvania line. The Minister has made a loan of the new Money if it can be got ready to be repaid in specie when the fleet arrives so that I have some hopes that we shall have it in our power to pay our troops a proportion of specie equivalent to what the french troops receive while they act together. If this can be accomplished so far as relates to the privates it may prevent jealousies between them and the forces of our ally. As to the limitation of the generals power of cooperation I consider it as a thing of no consequence except as it may remove the blind behind which it would have been proper to mask our designs.(1) Since it appears to be the general sentiment of Congress that war could not be carried on without the limmits of these States unless by their express direction. Nor indeed do I conceive it possible with our present force while the enimy retain their army in this quarter to transport any of ours into Canada.  JUNE 9, 1780  The fate of Charles town yet remains a secret every day however seems in some measure to falsify Rivingtons story. We yesterday recd. a Letter from Chase who asserts roundly that all was safe there on the 18th.

Mr. Williams did mention to me something about advancing the rent but I stopt him short, & told him, he must not expect it, as I was certain your expences on the road must have exhausted your funds, & money was not to be had out of the Continental Treasury, but you will find those people, (I mean of his class) as grinding as ever Jews were.  Could I conceive myself any ways useful in Congress at this time, towards promoting the welfare of my own Country, nothing could induce me to be absent. But if Chs. Town falls, it must be by our exertions here in the course of this Campaign, that we can promise ourselves the most distant hopes of regaining it during the war. And I should feel the utmost anxiety were it to be in the hands of the enemy, at the commencement of a treaty of peace. I have much to say to you on this subject, which would not be prudent to commit to paper. And it will keep very well 'till that period arrives, if I should not see you sooner. Probably the conclusion of this campaign, will JUNE 9, 1780  introduce this subject. I say, under these circumstances, I think I can render more essential services here, in promoting vigour, & activity, in the states to draw forth their resources, in such manner, as to put it in our power to act with efficacy, in our intended Offensive operations, if this opportunity is lost, we cannot reasonably expect, nor should we deserve another. You will find in our circular letters to the States, (Copies of which have been transmitted to Congress) a full State of our affairs, Such as we have done. I would recommend them to your perusal, tho' they are lengthy, they will be worth your serious attention, & afford you much information. If the States exert them selves as they ought, the Campaign will most probably end happily if they do not, the reverse, perhaps fatally.  I cannot as yet believe Chs. Town is lost, at least not on the twelfth of May, or you certainly would have received intelligence of it many days ago properly authenticated. If it has fallen, or does fall, I fear the whole Country goes with it, for having nothing but a few discontented fluctuating militia to depend on, we shall never be in any condition to check the ravages of a merciless enemy, & I imagine our people have not fortitude enough to see their properties destroyed, when their submissions can be the means of saving it. I suppose they will have as little respect for us, as for any two Gentlemen whatever. For my own part I shall look on myself (whenever this event happens) as not worth a groat, unless we can retake the country or have it restored by treaty, then the land must remain but nothing else. As to becoming a British subject again, if a restoration of my Estate is to depend on those terms, why let them keep it, & the Devil keep them with it.  You will 'ere this have heard of the manuvre of the enemy the sixth inst. I went down with The General, & remained there the whole day, there was a good deal of skirmishing between our Militia & a few Continental troops, & the enemy, they were very closely engaged for about half an hour, and our Militia behaved extremely well indeed, there was much skirmishing likewise yesterday on their retreat, some few prisoners, (of the enemy) have been taken, but by all accounts the Militia have suffered severely, I have no doubt of it, for they fought bravely. The enemy are still at Elizabeth town. Their retreat with some other circumstances, may at first blush, appear rather pleasing, but on my mind it has a very different effect. They have answered the purposes for which they came out, in all respects but one. It appears to me, their first object was to try the force of our Army they lay the whole day of Wednesday within view of us, burning, & destroying every thing that came in their way, & used every provocation, to induce us to fight them, we did not, therefore they are convinced we could not, consequently, the moment Clinton arrives, (which must now be hourly look'd for, whether he takes Chs. Town, or not) he will instantly make a dead push at this army, &  JUNE 10, 1780  either oblige us to fight him, or drive us over the Delaware with the loss of all the stores here. West point must of course then fall. A pretty situation we should then be in to be sure. This can only be prevented by this Army's being instantly reinforced. The point they failed in, was giving an opportunity to our troops to desert, which they did not. From the accounts they have received of the discontent prevailing in our army, they had great expectations of drawing over to them a considerable number of our men-however they were disappointed. I think it would not be amiss to shew this paragraph to some members of Congress, or if you like, may read it in Congress. As I believe it to be a true State of the case & I believe the genl. has not time to write. I am my Dear Bee yours most Affectly, Jno. Mathews ""

This Measure is adopted in Consequence of a Proposal from the Minister of France, who seems desirous to aid & support our Paper Currency, and better gain Assurances that the Specie shall be duly paid. Although no rate of Exchange is mentioned yet I presume the Intention is, to receive the new Bills at Par with Specie, or the Bills now in Circulation at forty for one.  I am in Doubt whether the Monies are, or can be soon collected in Connecticut, sufficient to enable your Excellency to comply with this Application; should that be the Case, rather than the Minister should be disappointed, and his generous Proposal fail of Effect, I beg leave to suggest whether some Mode cannot be devised, for the Government of Connecticut to raise the Money on their own Account; or Individuals to advance it, & by such means to obtain the Advantage of the Specie.  A Number of the new Bills are struck, and the first Parcel will be sent to Connecticut, and probably reach Hartford before this comes to hand.

  Dear Sir Morris town Saturday morning, June 10th 1780  I have many thanks to render you for your favor of the 7th Instant(1) which Colo. Hay was so good as to deliver me at nine last night. It affords me a very sensible satisfaction to be advised that our legislature has so unanimously adopted the recommendation of Congress on the subject of Finance not only because our sentiments are thereby approved, but because It evinces a disposition to Co-operate Effectually with Congress than which nothing is more Chagrining to the disaffected. I am persuaded the funds Established for the redemption JUNE 10, 1780  of the bills will be Competent, If prudence takes the lead in disposing of the Confiscated property and Oeconomy In the Expenditures.  You request my thoughts on a Supply bill. I have not been in bed for three nights past and on horseback much the greatest portion of time since Wednesday morning, hence I feel myself very little in Condition to Arrange my thoughts with propriety on Any Subject. I will however commit myself to your discretion In confidence that your friendship will make every allowance.  Beef or pork, flour, hay, and short forrage were allotted to our state as their quota of supplies; of some, or all of these, I suppose considerable quantities have been collected by the Continental offices since the 1 st of December last. The deficiencies must be made up at least. To do this I would advise in your act to recite that Quota assigned to you, to observe that part hath already been furnished, and that you now mean to provide, not only for making up the defi[ci]ency, but Also to procure additional supplies for every department of the Army, If they should be required.  Perhaps It would be proper at this Conjuncture when exertion is so much wanted and when objects of such vast magnitude display themselves, to authorize the Governor to appoint agents, to Collect, purchase, or even If necessary to Impress the supplies which may be wanted, but as you may not have money to furnish the agents with, they should be directed to give Certificates for what they receive payable at one or more pay offices to be Established by the state, and the day of payment fixed to a Certain time after the date of the Certificates. In paying these no regard ought to be had to the prices fixed by Congress. The Currant price should be given whether It be more or less than that, for if the real price of the Commodity (no matter from what cause) was higher than that which the state can charge In Account with the United States, It would be evidently unjust to Confine the Individual to the fixed price, as he would then bear more than his proportion of the public burthen. On the Contrary If the Currant price should be less than the fixed one, the state ought to have the advantage. Otherwise the Sellar would bear less of the public burthen than his proportion. This Method I think should be pursued until the whole of the allotted articles are furnished-and In order to Determine with competent precision when that is, certificates should as early as possible be procured of all Supplies furnished Since the first day of December last, the Quarter Masters & Commissarys to furnish these certificates. Indeed it is Essential to the Interest of the state that these should be obtained, as will Evidently appear by having recourse to the act of Congress of the 25th February last. (2) Whatsoever additional articles like those enumerated In said Act, or whatever others may be wanted, should be procured by the same Agents, and In the same Manner together with the transportation, but the certificates on the pay offices should   In this case Specify the Sum as agreed for by the agents wether It be more or less than the price fixed by Congress, and should be paid upon the Certificates because the whole must be repaid the state, which In this case is only to be Considered as lending Its Credit or Its money to the United States, the latter to be reimbursed either out of Its proportion of taxes, or If those do not Amount to the whole Credit which the State has pledged, then out of the Continental treasury. It may be asked what agents ought to be Employed, I should advise the Quarter Master & Commissary. These officers must Exist. They will be on Established pay, and being under the direction of the Governor so far as the state may make provision for Supplies and transportation they will be no Expence to the State. Other agents will be a heavy one, Imbarrasments will take place, requisitions will be made by the Continental Officers. If the State officers fail to comply, or complying do not furnish the articles of the very best quality, complaints and disputes will Ensue. Besides what is It more than a Change of names, the state agents will have all the duty of Quarter Masters & Commissaries to do, & It is probable they will not understand the business so well. It is possible they may not be such good men. It is certain that they will not so well know where the resources of the Country lay.  If the Country was well supplied with wheat and flour, and If every person who must bear a share of the public burthen could furnish this article, It might be well to Quota It out on the Several Counties, but that neither is, or ever can be the case. You must then give an Alternative to pay the assessment in kind, or in Cash, but on this Alternative people will speculate. If cash is better than wheat they will pay In the latter. If cash is worse than wheat they will pay in Cash, and then you are Still driven to purchase. If you give no Alternative and say If they have no wheat they must purchase It, then you make an hundred purchasers instead of one, and you risk advancing the price, and depreciating the new Money, and probably draw on a heavy expence In transportation from remote places. I believe the best way is to purchase without any kind of Assessment, with money, If you have It, with Credit If you have not money.  I fear, like you, that the disaffected and those who wish the old money reallized in their hands by taxes on the people, will attempt to discredit the new Money, but serve them as they would Serve us, Let the agents whether they be Quarter Masters or Commissaries seize as much as possible in what Supplies these dark characters may have, then they will become Interested In supporting the Credit of the new money.  By the act of the 18th March, If fourty dollars be brought to the treasury whether by taxes, or voluntary for the purpose of exchange, one is emitted In Exchange, and one to Strengthen the treasury. If then you could Induce the people to bring in the old to Exchange  for the New, the treasury would be Strengthened by one dollar in Value equivalent to every forty brought in, and the Credit Established by the Exchange, would not subscriptions for the purpose have a good Effect? Or Would It be too bold a stroke to Call In the Old by act of the legislature, and give in Exchange the new? We have compleated a System for the Quarter Master department, not the best, but I believe as good a one as the times will admit of. This business ought to have been done in November, then a compleat reform might have been made, but had we [lopped off?] of every exuberance at this Critical moment all had been confusion. We were therefore under the necessity of temporizing. The outlines are three Great divisions, the first N. York Inclusive East, and the second thence west to Maryland Inclusive, and the third the remainder of the States. In Each division a Superintendant-one Deputy QM General In Each State to be approved of by the Executive authority of the State If necessary-with a competent number of assistants-No Forage Masters. I believe Colo. Hay will be the Deputy In our State, and Mr. Cuyler the Superintendant In the Commissary Branch.  In the night between Tuesday and Wednesday the Enemy landed at Elizabeth town point with between four & five thousand men and Immediately pushed forward, pointing to this place. Maxwells brigade supported by the Militia who turned out with alertness and behaved with Spirit, made what opposition they could at every post which promised fair to retard the Enemy. By Eleven the enemy had advanced to the Connecticut farms, about nine Miles on this Elizabeth town point, here a Sharp Contest ensued, the Enemy to gain a passage over the bridge near Springfield, ours to prevent them, the former retired to their main body with Some loss, ours kept the Ground; the troops from hence were put In Motion and Arrived about four on the heights between this and Springfield, from that time until dark was Spent In reconnoitring each other and on their part In burning houses; about Eleven at night they retired to Elizabeth town. Maxwell and the Militia followed In the Morning. At one in the afternoon on Thursday Our main body began to move forward to the heights the Enemy had left, there to remain until their Strength, position & Intentions could be ascertained; We reconnoitred them from Halsteads point which afforded us a good view. Judged their number as has been Mentioned, which was too heavy for us to venture an Attack. On Friday very Early they were reinforced by about three hundred horse and some foot. As our force Including militia was still Inferior we retired to our first position above Springfield. Some Intelligence having been received that they should Attempt the destruction of our stores by turning our flanks with their light horse, the General requested me to repair here, and make a disposition of the troops. Nothing has happened. It is now ten oClock, not a word from the army, whence I conclude that the  JUNE 11, 1780  Enemy are still at Elizabeth town. If they were not well Informed of our weakness they would not remain where they are. If the General had three thousand men more they must be ruined, but his numbers without such a reinforcement are Incompetent. I dare not tell you our Strength or rather our weakness.  I have this moment received a line from Mr. Duane, (3) Inclosing a paper he sent me ( 4) which I have transmitted to the legislature thru Mr. Benson.  I have urged much to pay a visit to the legislature but neither the General nor the Committe will Consent that I shall leave this.  Pray make my Compliments to all friends. I am Dear Sir, with Sincere Esteem Your friend & very Hum Servt,  Ph. Schuyler [P.S.] I find the Enemy were made to believe that If they came out in force, our army would not fight, the Country would submit, and that they would possess themselves of all our stores. They were surprised to find the Militia so firm-some were heard to Say the Americans fight like bull dogs. Every general officer in N. York was out, the Titular Governor came out In his Coach followed by fifty or sixty of the most Capital toadeaters in the town.  If the legislature should not approve of making the Quarter Master an Agent under an apprehension that an Improper person might be appointed to that office, If they have no objection to Colo Hay they might appoint him by name, altho I think It may be attended with Inconvenience If sickness or death Should deprive us of his services.

We are happy, Sir, to find your sentiments coincident with our own, on the necessity there is at this important and alarming conjuncture, of the most strenuous exertions of the states. You have been an Eye witness to JUNE 11, 1780  the distress of the Country, and the danger to which this Army was exposed, in that critical moment when the enemy in superior force pointed their operations against it, much too weak to face them in the field with any prospect of effectual resistance, altho led by the bravest and best of men. You have seen our heavy Cannon and stores exposed to the most imminent danger because the means of removing them to places of security were not in our power, and had the Enemy pursued their object, it is more than probable the whole would have been lost; hence it is evident that not a moment ought to be lost in sending on the reinforcements which have been required. Indeed, Sir, the states are exposed to a most dreadful calamity from the reduced condition of the Army, and more especially so, as the British troops from Carolina are daily expected here.  The plan you have proposed for an immediate supply of money appears to us the most elegible of any yet suggested,(1) we think the most salutary consequences would result to the community if it was adopted.  Your attention to the Welfare of your Country will we are persuaded, induce in you in every exertion and your Character and abilities, with these exertions will render emminent service in this day of distress.(2 )  We are, with respect and esteem, Sir, Your Most humble Servts.

  My dear sir, Morristown 11 th June 1780 The distressed Situation of the Army, & the general State of pub- JUNE 11, 1780  lick Affairs, will, I trust, apologize for my addressing You at a Time when I have nothing very pleasing to offer. The present reduced State of the Army, & the Want of every Species of Supplies, together with the consequent Ravages & Insults of the Enemy, may be all traced to an exhausted Treasury, which must be immediately supplied, to enable our General to cooperate with the Forces that are daily expected from our good Ally. Taxes, You well know, are too slow in their Operations to effect this, domestick & foreign Loans are at present inadequate & the only prospect that remains is from the vigorous Exertions of the Citizens of these united States. Your Zeal & Abilities in the Common Cause are well known to & acknowledged by all who have had the pleasure of your Acquaintance, & these supported by your extensive Influence, may I conceive at this critical Juncture, produce the most salutary Effect.  What I mean to propose is an immediate Association of the Merchants thro'out the united States to support the late Plan of Congress relative to Finance,(1) & to promote amongst the Inhabitants of their respective Counties, Cities & Towns, a speedy & vigorous Exertion to send into the respective loan offices, all the old continental Bills of Credit, & receive the Amount thereof in new Bills at the Exchange established by the Resolution of Congress. The Merchants of Philadelphia & Boston may I presume do more to accomplish this, than the Legislatures of their respective States, & by adopting the Measure may make it general thro'out the Continent. I am well aware of your Objections to that Plan & was so fully in Sentiment with You, that previous to the passing thereof, being consulted by some Members of Congress, I freely gave them my Opinion, that it was inconsistent with the publick Faith, & ought not to be adopted; but it is now an Act of Congress, is confirmed by several of the States, & is the only Measure by which We have any Prospect of immediate Supplies.  The Advantages that may result from an Exertion on this Occasion will appear by considering, that every Dollar so exchanged will furnish another for reinforcing & Supplying the Army; that the Treasury may then be immediately & amply supplyed; & that the Army may be speedily reinforced & furnished with Necessaries to cooperate with the Forces of our Ally. Should this be accomplished, We shall have the happy prospect of bringing our Enemies to reasonable Terms, & the War to a speedy Conclusion; whilst the Confidence of our good Ally will be establshed, & other Powers be disposed to follow his Example, but on the other Hand if the powerful Succours which are daily expected from France should be compelled by our Inability or Indolence to return disgraced; will they not be so incensed, notwithstanding the good Will of their sovereign & his Minister towards Us, as to be ever after irreconcileable to Americans? Will not an Alliance with Spain, if not previously adopted, be prevented? Will not the other Powers in Europe be so convinced of our Want of  Resources, or Wisdom & Virtue to draw them forth, as to shun & contemn Us? Will not such as are friendly to G Britain be encouraged to afford her immediate Assistance? & will not the Cause of America be in the most imminent Danger, if not irretreivably lost?  It gives me great Pain to hold up so disagreable a picture of our affairs, but my Duty to my Country obliges me to be explicit on this occasion, and I assure You sir, that I have not seen at any period, so fair a prospect by vigorous Exertions of establishing our Independence, or on the other Hand such dreadful Consequences as are to be apprehended from Supineness, or feeble Efforts. In carrying thro this Plan, You will undoubtedly have to oppose the weak & selfish Friends, as well as the secret & insidious Enemies of America, but I sincerely hope that You will see the Necessity of the Measure & at all Events support it.  The Committee of Congress at Camp are earnestly desirous of carrying this Plan into Effect, & would have addressed the Merchants on this Occasion, did they not conceive that such a proceeding would be considered as extra official by the Legislatures of some of the States; they have nevertheless expressly desired me to promote it in the eastern States, & his Excellency the General is also much in favour of it.  I cannot conclude without informing You, that after the Army had left Elizabeth Town, I had the pleasure of seeing Governor Livingston's Family who have thus far happily escaped the Ravages of the Enemy; the particular of which you will undoubtedly receive from Miss Livingston. Pray give my best Respects to your Lady, & beleive me to be sir with every Sentiment of Esteem & Respect, Your most obedt & most hum sert. E. Gerry  ""

  Dear Sir Philadelphia 11 th June 1780(1) I recd. by Mr. Elting your favor as I suppose of the 29th May tho dated in March. You have I hope before this had my answer (2) to yours from Midletown.  It gives me great pleasure to find that our Legislature have been so unanimous in their adoption of the plan of finance recommended by congress which I am persuaded will make its way good in spite of all the opposition of a few interested persons. This state has  JUNE 11, 1780  adopted it but with a suspending clause, a very extraordinary maneuvre & of a piece with the rest of their political conduct hitherto. Tho I am happy to be able to assure you that the spirit of Patriotizm is again breaking out here, and that within a few days both the people & the Legislature seem to be reviving from their Torper. They have great resources & we may hope for much from their exertion. Maryland has not yet adopted the plan owing to an unhappy difference between their Senate & Assembly about making it a tender. But upon cooling down they see they have broke upon a matter of no moment & at their present sessions will probably agree upon it. I am unhappy that it was not in my power to be with you this session as I had intended, I already begin to find the warmth of this place disagree as much with my constitution as its expence does with my fortune. Nothing but the earnest request of our friends, & a sense of duty would have kept me here. Our friend the Genl.(3) has not been able with all his attention to regimen & diet to keep himself intirely free from his much dreaded enemy the Ague which has shaken him for some days past. However he escaped his fit yesterday by dint of a regular application of the bark.  I see your embarasments about the repeal of the tender law, it is a very delicate subject & I hardly know what to advise. It shd. however at first view seem to me that a man who hires money during the state of depreciation for which he pays an interest does not engage to secure it against depreciation, if he repays it at the end of the period for which it was borrowed. If he keeps it longer he takes the risk upon himself. Because whoever borrows money for a certain time, & pays an interest, is supposed to give the interest for the use during the whole time-And the Lender must be considered as the indorser of the publick bills of exchange for the time. But if the borrower keeps them beyond the proper time without applying to the indorser for repayment & the meanwhile the publick becomes bankrupt he takes the risk upon himself & shall have no remedy over against the endorser who shall receive from him the value of the bills at the time of the contracts terminating.  As to debts where no interest is paid, & the purchaser or borrower still keeps the money there is no doubt but that he takes upon himself the risk of the depreciation. (4)  We are still at a Loss about Charlestowns fate, tho' there is a man in town who affirms that he saw the British colours hoisted there the 12th & gives a particular account of its surrender, having been confined to a prison ship in the harbour at the time, & left it the 17th. Yet as we can not account for our receiving no authentick advise from there, or for their knowing nothing of this business at New York, we hardly can persuade ourselves to give credit to his story.  Since the departure of Mr. Peabody we have met with every obstruction from New Hampshire & having fortunately got nine states  together yesterday I pressed there proceeding to a hearing,(5 ) but upon New Hampshires representing that their Agent was absent, with all the papers, we were obliged to let the business go off till the second Wednesday in Sepr. & a new Notice is ordered to be given to the parties interested. I feel most exceedingly for the distress of our friends their and I have allways thought that some more efficacious & immediate relief should be given them than any that can come from this quarter.  Tell Mr. Hubbard that he owes me a very long letter & that in these times every man ex[pects] to have his paper debts paid in. Present my comps. to Mr. Courtland & Mr. R Yates.

  Sir, In committee of Congress, Morristown, June 12th 1780 Your favor of the 6th instant covering acts of Congress of the are duly received. (1)  Should the enemy oblige our army to retire from its present position, it is not improbable that it must take post either beyond the Delaware, or in the highlands. If at the former, the enemy will undoubtedly attempt the reduction of the posts in the highlands. If at the latter, it will be reduced to the greatest distress for the article of flour, as in all probability supplies of that kind will be intercepted in their way to the Army. It is therefore of the first importance that an ample quantity should be without delay conveyed to New Windsor or kings ferry. The superior influence which Congress has beyond what the committee can be supposed to possess in the States from whence flour only can be obtained induces us to request that they will urge the necessity of hastening on whatever can be procured, and carriage for the transportation.  The Enemy we are informed have this Morning advanced from Elizabeth point, to the Capes. Our Army continues to occupy the heights west of Springfield. JUNE 12, 1780  We have the honor to inclose your Excellency copy of our circular letter to the States of the 2d instant, with copy of one we have this day dispatched, together with copies of the General letters referred to in those to the States.  We have the honor to be with perfect esteem and respect, Your Excellencys most obedient humble Servts, Ph. Schuyler  Jno. Mathews Nathl Peabody P.S. Since inclosing the above, the commander in chief has advised us, that whenever the British now in this State shall be reinforced by the troops from Carolina, which he momently expects to be advised of, he will in all probability be obliged to retire beyond the Delaware, and leave the fortresses in the highlands of New York to be defended as well as they may be by the present weak and inadequate garrison, as he has no prospect of supplying an additional number of troops at that post, for the want of flour.  In the utmost distress to be reduced to this sad alternative, he has entreated us to apply to the State of Pensylvania on the subject, we have accordingly addressed ourselves to Governor Reed, and also begged the favor of him to transmit copy of our letter to the Governors of Delaware and Maryland.(2) Permit us Sir, to request the intervention of Congress by seconding our application.(3)  ""

  In Committee of Congress Sir Morris TownJune 12, 1780  It is with great satisfaction that we learn the legislature of your State has invested your Excellency with ample powers to draw forth every resource of the state at this interesting conjuncture.  Since our letter of this date, (1) The Commander in Chief has advised us, that in the present situation of our affairs should the British force  JUNE 12, 1780  return from Carolina (which event must be hourly looked for) he cannot think of risking his army at the post at West Point. The inevitable consequence of which must be the sacrifice of that small remains of an army now become inadequate to any effectual resistance even against the present British force in this quarter, as there is not flour at that post even for the garrison now there. Under these circumstances he must be under the necessity of abandoning that important post to shift for itself, in the best manner they can, & he can have no alternative, but to affect his retreat across the Deleware.  On a serious consideration of this distressed State of the Army, you must pardon our importunity Sir, when we call on you in the most urgent manner & conjure you as you value the welfare of the United States of America, to use your most strenuous endeavours to procure without one moments loss of time, at least Ten Thousand Barrels of flour, and cause the same to be transported to Kings ferry or New Windsor. It is on your State alone in the present exigency of our affairs that we must rely for support in this article. Your knowledge of the importance of that post, need no comments on our part, how indespensibly necessary it is that it should be preserved not only as a safe retreat for our Army should they be so circumstanced, as to make it necessary, but also to keep open the communication between these and the eastern states & for the preservation of this already too much distressed state. Should our present application not be attended with the desired affect, The consequences must in al1 human probability be fatal.  We have the honor to be with respect Your Most Obt. Servt.

  In committee of Congress, Sir, Circular No. 4. Morristown, June 12, 1780.  We have the honor to inclose you copy of a letter addressed to us by the commander in chief. (1) The contents will advise you to what an alarming crisis our affairs are reduced. The General observes with great propriety, that this committee \""need no arguments to evince the danger.\"" Indeed we do not: our own observations have led to the fullest conviction that unless the force stated in our second letter, of the 25th ultimo, is drawn into the field with a celerity equal to  JUNE 12, 1780  the urgency of the occasion, the period which is to end our liberty, and commence the most disgraceful state of slavery which human nature has ever experienced, is not far distant. But dark and gloomy as the prospect is, America has it in her power to dispel the cloud, by those exertions of which she is abundantly capable, & to which it is her duty to rouse, from every consideration which can affect the human heart.  We are, most indubitably, possessed of the means wherewith to expel the enemy from every part of the continent; but it requires a display of that virtue which distinguished the Citizens of Rome when their state was, as ours is now, on the brink of ruin, And we trust Americans, impressed with a proper sense of the blessings of peace, Liberty, and Independence, will follow the bright example, and evince to future ages, what great minds are capable of, when driven to the extremity of distress.  We dare not suppose, Sir, that efficient measues have not [been] adopted by your state to complete your Battalions to the establishment recommended in the letter above referred to; on the contrary, we beleive that the men are raised, or raising, but we have to conjure you to hasten them on to the Army, without a moments delay. We intreat you likewise, to give the most pointed direction, to induce an unremitting attention to forward the supplies allotted to your State to be furnished, as specified in our letter of the 2d Instant.  Had the Enemy on Wednesday last, pursued what we generally beleived to be their object, our heavy Cannon & stores, would inevitably have fallen into their hands, as our Military force was incompetent to their protection, and the means of conveying them to places more distant, for want of horses and Carriages, out of our power.  Since writing the above, a second letter, from the General, has been handed us, a copy whereof we inclose.(2) Previous to our recommendation to compleat the Battalions to five hundred & four rank and file, we had a conferance with the general on the subject, in which the matter was thoroughly canvassed, and the necessity of the augmentation clearly evinced; the reduction of Charles Town, was then problematical; we had even hopes that it would have been saved, and the Maryland & Delaware lines, have returned to this Army, which then, with the quota requested of the states would have amounted to about Twenty five thousand men, the number which Congress had promised our illustrious ally, should be brought into the field, to co-operate with his troops. It is now beleived, that Charles Town is reduced, and the troops which defended it, prisoners, consequently we shall not have the Maryland and Delaware troops: hence those in this quarter will be less, by nearly three thousand men, than our estimate, we therefore most earnestly intreat that no deduction may be made from the numbers we have stated as necessary.   We have the honor to be, with the greatest respect & Esteem, Your Excellency's, Most Obedt. Huble Servts. Ph. Schuyler,  Jno. Mathews, Nathl. Peabody.  ""

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia June 12th. 1780. On my return here, (1) among other things I was applied to in behalf of Wm. Smith, the wretched father of the two wretched sons, who murdered Boyd the Dy. Collector of the taxes for Concord township in Chester county, to admit him to Bail. The father is confined in Chester goal, the sons here; the brother & nephew of the old man, being formerly known to me as clients, interceded zealously, but their request could not be granted, as Mr. Bryan & myself conceived it for the public good to issue a Precept for holding another court of Oyer and Terminer and General Goal Delivery for Chester county on Monday the twenty sixth instant. A good deal of old business & some new, since the last, induce me to believe we shall be employed there the whole week, so that you can lay out your accounts accordingly. James Steel, who was indicted for passing counterfeit money in York county and left his Bail, has been arrested for the same practices in Chester county & committed to Chester Goal by Justice Clingan. I have been kept almost constantly busy in arresting & examining criminals, hearing parties on habeas corpora &c. &c. ever since I came here. The Eighty dollar Bills are counterfeited, & have been circulated last week in great quantities. The last M, in the word \""seculorum\"" in the motto round the device in the genuine bill is purposely made near as wide again as in the other parts, in the counterfeit it is of the same width, and the first word \""The\"" in the genuine bills has the E at a proper distance from the H, but in the counterfeits it is very near to the H. There are twenty other marks whereby they may be distinguished, but these will be sufficient for you to discover them.  I am but too well satisfied, that Charlestown capitulated on the eleventh of May in the afternoon, at least all hostilities then ceased & the Enemy were in possession next day, notwithstanding we have no of ficial or other certain accounts, nor even a Lre. about the matter from the Town or it's Environs, and notwithstanding the best Whigs believe or affect to believe the contrary. Indeed it appears to me to have been ingloriously & unnecessarily surrendered, I suppose owing to the militia & inhabitants. This I fear will be attended with the loss of the whole State, if not of North-Carolina also; but we shall recover them again, as I suppose the Great Land-Jobbers & Speculators of Virginia will now exert themselves to retain what they have lately acquired.  The Enemy have been out in full force last Thursday in New Jersey, where there have been two skirmages, chiefly with our Militia, who behaved gallantly and always got the better. The Enemy have murdered Mrs. Caldwell, the wife of Parson Caldwell, because he is a  JUNE 12, 1780  zealous Whig; they shot her sitting in her own room with nine little children of her own standing round her begging for mercy; then they burnt the house with every article in it. His Meeting-House, and several other houses at Elisabeth-town shared the same fate. They are fortifying at Elisabeth-town Point, and as soon as Clinton returns from Charlestown purpose to attack General Washington; or if they cannot bring him to a general engagement, which I trust they will not in his present weak condition, owing to the great detachments from his army to the Southward and elsewhere, they intend again for this city. The militia of this State must be called out, and I hope they will not behave like the people of Virginia and North Carolina, refuse to march 'till New-Jersey is conquered and the Enemy at their doors. We must rouse from our lethargy and make one more vigorous exertion, and all will yet be safe.  Tho' the loss of such an Army, six General Officers, 2500 Regular troops, near 4000 militia, 5 frigates, & other vessels of war, with all our ammunition, stores &c &c at Charlestown, is the greatest we have met with since the commencement of the war, yet it may be all for the best, as I am convinced nothing but this, or something as striking would draw off the general attention to the accumulation of property, and fix it upon the general cause once more. Indeed a noble spirit seems again to pervade this City.  We have had no less than 35 arrivals from sea within ten days past, and many more are expected daily.  I am, Dear Sir, with much esteem, Your most obedient & humble servant, Thos M:Kean  P.S.

  Dear Sir Morris town June 12th 1780 General Arnold deliverd me your favor of the 9th Inst this morning.  I believe with you that the states will enter Into spirited exertions but I much doubt If they will be able to draw such a force Into the field as would afford a proble prospect of success in an Enterprize agt New York. The Enemy will in all probability be able to oppose 18000 men to us. If we operate with the whole of our force against Either the City or their fortresses on Long Island, very nearly all theirs may be opposed to us, and we should have little chance of penetrating; If we attack both points our force must be divided and the relative force will Still be the same with this further disadvantage to us that they may easily throw three quarters of their troops to either place and make a Sortie which would endanger one or the other of the besieging armies, our hopes will therefore be reduced to the Effect of a Close blockade and Success from such a maneuvre must depend on the Scarcity of provisions with the Enemy-but altho we May not be able to reduce New York with the force we may bring Into the field, Yet It is more than probable that with the aid of the Militia we should be sufficiently Strong to defend the Country, after having made a detatchment to Cooperate with the french troops. In the reduction of Canada, the Influence such a Conquest would have on our affairs You will readily conceive, I have therefore to lament that the Idea should be discarded In Congress.  The New York papers give us the Capitulation with all the letters that past between Sir Henry Clinton and General Lincoln. I have little doubt but that the town is reduced, and I fear that In attempting to save a town we have lost an Army and a State, I sincerely pity Lincoln, the brave Defence he has made will not Shelter him from the Imputation of wanting prudence and Judgement. Indeed I am Informed that Members of Congress already fault him for not having retired out of the town, this is cruel for from a fair Construction of what Congress did, he had no Alternative left.  No one here can make a Satisfactory guess at what Induced Kniphausen to Halt his army on Wednesday last on the heights-East of Springfield, as he might have reached those on this side before our Army could possibly possess themselves of them. Indeed if they had General Washington could not have made Effectual resistance with 2396 Rank and file Continental troops and About five hundred Militia, and our heavy Cannon & Stores would have been lost.  You alarm me by Informing that Contributions are making to fill up the Pensylvania battalions. Good God, is this Exertion? Is this providing for an Immediate want, Is It by such Means that we are JUNE 12, 1780  to draw an Army Into field, such as we have promised our ally- Indeed, Indeed, I fear we shall become a reproch amongst the nations.

They have built a floating bridge to secure a retreat to staten Island if necessary. Two or three little battles have taken place, in which the militia fought well but have suffered greatly.

You are doubtless informed that the Continental Troops of the Delaware and Maryland Lines under Baron de Kalb are gone to the southward, and it is probable a considerable Body of Militia from North Carolina & Virginia are assembled and collecting to cover the Country from the ravages of the Enemy.  As Congress are unable without further Information to give any particular Orders, your own Prudence & Experience will dictate the most proper Measures to be adopted as Circumstances shall appear, for the Defence & Preservation of the Country until further Information can be obtained of the Situation, Strength & Designs of the Enemy.  I have the honour to be, with every Sentiment of Esteem and respect, Your humble servant, Sam. Huntington President  ""

My Family is perfectly recovered from the small-pox, which to them was so favorable that they never lay'd by for it. Mrs. Walker had only two pustules & Milly one for each of the united States. We are comfortably enough lodged & but for the exorbitant expences of the place, might do well enough.

We wish our State would fall on some expedient to furnish such Supplys as may be intended for us, as we find it extremely difficult to get Cash here.  Genl.

  Dear Sir: Morristown, 14th June 1780.  In looking over my papers this day find two of your favours,(1) but find no memorandum of my acknowledging them, so take it for granted I have not.  But be assured the neglect was not for want of proper respect. We have been exceedingly harassed and fatigued of late owing to the movements of the enemy, which has kept the papers upon the move for some days.  Your letter of the 4th ult. enclosing several papers respecting the medical department makes mention of my having received the last returns before leaving Phila., but I have not those papers, nor do I recollect receiving them. The Eastern returns have come to hand since here. We have not as yet been able to take up the Hospital Department. The sick and wounded suffer for want of stores. Your kind aid in procuring some to be sent forward would be of eminent service to the army.  The enemy lay in much the same situation they have done for several days past. However, Gen. Schuyler who is now going to Philadelphia, will give you the fullest account of affairs here. I wish you to confer with him upon various subjects of great moment as our situation is very critical. We want the union as well as the wisdom of every friend to extricate us from the horrid dilemma. The Commander in Chief is under great embarrassment by a resolve of Congress restricting him in his operations to the thirteen states, the enemy being apprised of this well know he cannot pursue any object without the states, tho' ever so easy and advantageous for us. Of course they will concentrate their whole force, so as to render any undertaking hazardous on our side. We may be in a situation to cooperate with our allies against Canada or Nova Scotia on some other plan, not within these states to very great advantage, when there may be no object in our ability to pursue within the states. You will pardon me when I take the liberty to observe as my opinion that it is of the last importance to the Eastern States to have the Commander in Chief left totally unshackled with respect to his operations. I mean if we should be happy enough to keep up an army.  I must therefore entreat you to advise my friend Mr. Lovell of the matter, and shall rest assured that both of you will ardently pursue such measures as you shall judge for the public good.  I have the honor to be with perfect respect your most obedient and humble servant, Nath. Peabody  P.S. Compliments to the ladys and gentlemen of the family.

  Dear General Philada. 15th June 1780 Whilst I congratulate you on your present unanimous appointment to the Command of the Southern department, I cannot be insensible of the prospects before you & the many known & unknown difficulties you have to encounter. Let wisdom, patience, and fortitude from above carry you through.  These two last days & part of the Nights I have been employed on your affair-as your first nomination (under the Suden concern for the loss of Charlestown & State of that Country) Seemed to import little else than hasty Orders to March; it's true a Committee was at the Same time appointed to consider the number of troops to be drawn forth, in the first instance, but Still you wanted money in order to proceed, as well as powers to call on these States for future Supplys. For this I called on the board of war, who to do them justice cordially fell in with everything & reported thereon Such a Sum for the journey, and other powers, as I hope will be agreeable to you for the present, and Congress readily resolv'd on the Report. I have more privately pressed the Board of War to Send also by the Express, One piece of Linnen, meaning the major part for your Self, and the residue for Major Armstrong, this they thought was a little out of their way, but gave me more than half a promise. The Major has not a Shilling until he reach you to pay what debt he may be in, beside my keeping him in Some pocket money these three months past; he will communicate to you what I have wrote him respecting Rank. Anything of this Sort must now come thro' the Board of War.(1) The Magazines at Westpoint are empty, and General Washingtons Situation for force & provisions, in one word is very Allarming. The Enemy lately at Elizabeth Town in force above four thousand appear disposed to keep the field & are said to be daily Reinforced, their intentions a little mysterious. Some immagin to attack our Army now but weak, others that West point may be the Object perhaps the main motive may be to prevent a junction with the French troops shou'd any arrive. Money we have next to none, our credit greatly reduced & what may be the event of the Campaign is only known to God. We hope however that our loss to the South will serve to inspire the States with fresh vigour. The Government of Pennsylvania will I believe exert it's Self, having already in Some degree gone into Martial Law. Governor Clinton has I believe got in the Rear of Sir John Johnston & burned his Boats, if so the York line Such as it is may Soon return to the Army.

  Dr Sir Philadelphia June l5th, 1780. I am very Sorry that your Sudden departure for Camp prevented me from the pleasure of Seeing you again after the day I so agreeably Spent with you-and I am Still more Concern'd that I cannot hope to Succeed in having your Abilities engaged in the Command of the department where I am an Inhabitant, and whither I am Just Setting off.(1) I found, on examining the resolution I mentioned to you, that it was entered into on a particular Occasion of disputed rank,(2) and Commissions were cancelled and renewed agreeably to the principle adopted. Had the affair Occurred in the Winter, and a proper Scrutiny taken place, I am persuaded the principle would and ought to  JUNE 15, 1780  have been applied to you; and your Commission would, Consequently, have been made out So as to give you the indisputable rank. But as that was not done, and the time at present would not admit of Such disquisitions; I despaired of being able to fall on any mode that would Satisfy your Just, and delicate feelings, that forbids your offering the least possible Shadow of Injury to those of others, or of reconciling the wishes of my self and my Colleagues with the General, and more prevailing Considerations of public utility. We were therefore obliged, reluctantly, to forego a favorite object.  I received yours, inclosing a Copy of what you wrote to Major Lee on the affair to which my last to you related.(3) We were both peculiarly fortunate in a Mediator who possesses Such a Just Sense of honor and of propriety; and whose friendly regard to both, as well as his peculiar merit engaged our unlimitted Confidence. A different Character, most probly, would have perplexed the Misunderstanding still more, and Initated dispositions, of too much Sensibility, to lengths whose Consequences might have been unhappy. As a proof how entirely I acquiesse in your Sentence, I declare that my Esteem for and disposition towards Major Lee are not in the least impaired by the like Incident. Long life and health are the only things which, your own Merits cannot command, and these give me leave to wish you, Glory, and every thing else worthy your ambition, will always play round with the fondness of an enamoured mistress.

  Sir, Philada June 15. 1780  Congress repeat their Applications to your State.(1) They would willingly hope that their former representations have not been ineffectual, and that the States are pursuing Measures to enable our Armies to take the Field with a Force superior to that of the Enemy, and with such ample Supplies of Provisions as will not only maintain them in Plenty, but enable the Commander in Chief, if necessary on any extraordinary Occasion to avail himself of the Aid of the Militia. But upon these hopes Congress dare not rely. Every Moment presses. It is necessary they should have the most explicit Assurances, not JUNE 15, 1780  only that their requisitions, but that such Compliance will be as immediate as the public Wants are urgent. The Letters from our Committee at Head Quarters to you, state those Wants without Exaggeration. They state some Facts and leave to your judgements to supply others which it would have been improper to commit to Paper.  The Object of this Address is only to enforce their requests, and to entreat not to repose your Safety upon the Spirit and Vigilance of others, while any Means within your own Power are left untried. The present Occasion calls for the United Force of America. It gives us great Consolation, that, notwithstanding the Difficulties in which we are involved, the resources of the States if speedily applied, are sufficient to relieve us from them.  Every State in the Union is bound by the strongest Obligations to afford us their Aid, and we trust, that, at this critical Emergency, no present Ease, or Convenience of Individuals will be put in Competition with the lasting Happiness of Millions. That the rulers of States will not hesitate to exert their utmost Authority, and that the People have too much Understanding to refuse a temporary Submission to such vigorous Exertions as are necessary to secure them from continued Oppression, and established Tyranny.  A common Council involves the Power of Direction. Let not our Measures be checked or controuled by the Negligence or partial Views & Interests of separate Communities, while they profess to be Members of one Body. Too long have the dearest Interests of America been sacrificed to present Ease. Too many of us have slept in false Security. Let us awake before the Season for successful Exertion is passed .Judge you whether the Loss of Charlestown, and the Situation of your Grand Army do not call for every spirited Effort. The Objects which claim your immediate Attention are clearly pointed out by the requisitions of Congress, and their Committee at Head Quarters. Let them be complied with. Enable us to cooperate vigorously with the Fleets and Armies of our Ally, and we may reasonably hope, through the Blessing of divine Providence, for a speedy and happy Termination of a Controversy, which is to give Freedom and Independance to Millions.

The Paper which I send in Print is as good for your Information as if it had Thompson's Sanction. Col. Ternant arrived yesterday and Genl. Lincoln may be hourly expected. If no misfortune takes suddenly place upon our army at Morris Town, we shall do very well, upon Supposition That the other States rouse as much as this appears to have done. Genl. Gates is ordered to the Southward. I wish I knew what were Genl Washington's Intentions in regard to him. I know a Letter was sent on from Head Quarters about 10 Days ago but whether it was only a Letter of Intelligence from the Genl. or an Order I can not guess.(3)  My Son will deliver This and repay what you was so very kind and fatherly as to furnish him with in his late Embarrassment on his Way hither. He is prodigiously grown since I left him at home. He is quite young in his manners-a Colt without Education-a Sample of the Injury which arises to my Family from my long absence.

They were treated with all the Ceremonies due to the Troops of an Independent Nation, in the arrangements consequent upon Genl.

I could not before now even ask you to hope that the people would awake, but the very great Change which is taking place in this State is an Earnest of good Things from other parts. I am grieved to find that Mass. is so backward with her Batalions. I think that they will not, they cannot continue so a day longer.  I am now to refer you to Mr Rivington's Account of the true State of Charlestown. Col. Ternant arrived here on Wednesday P.M. Genl. Lincoln is hourly expected. This Loss was familiar to your Mind from your first getting the News of our Army being there in a Cul-deSac: But, false Reports have kept up a Hope here that makes the unfortunate Certainty more cutting now to our S[piri]ts.  Col. Ternant will doubtless write to you and tell you that it was a Wonder that the City did not fall sooner rather than that it is now captured. He appears to think that the Enemy respect the Beseiged for their perseverance. There has certainly been much Ceremony preserved in closing the Scene as if two European Armies had been  JUNE 15, 1780  contending, though the Name of Rebels is yet used in England to denominate Us.  Quere, now what is to be pursued when the French Fleet arrives. An Angel from Heaven, warlike as the best of Milton's could not now tell.

I will not at present enter into a dispute with you tho' I am of opinion that the Exertions of the Whiggs in those States have been great and in some States such as will deserve the Admiration of Mankind. My Petition will I trust, be soon verified that distress and Danger will rouse us to Action and Vigour, and reanimate us with a Degree of patriotic Zeal suited to the Magnitude of the Conjuncture and the Value of the Prize for which we contend. From this Opinion I am led to contemplate the approach of distress itself with Serenity and I had almost said with some Mixture of Contentment. It is an Evil which will be productive of essential good.  The Loss of Charles Town was an expected Event at least in the Judgement of Men of Experience and Information; far from producing Despondency it has pointed out the Necessity of Vigour in Government, and Exertion in the Citizens, in such strong Colours that the Flame of patriotism once more illuminates and revives our slumbering spirits.

The plan(3) is to engage them on their own Credit to send forward three millions of Rations and 500 Hogsheads of Rum which will be a Support of 75 days for 40,000 Men; and woud give us time to receive the Supplies of the States and the advantages of the new Harvest. Add to this that the best part of the human race, the Ladies, are contributing their Eloquence and their pin money for the public Service. It woud give you pleasure to see their Committees on their Rounds of their several districts pleading the Merits and the Wants of the Army: and pleading for them with resistless force. Will not a fire kindled up by these Angels overspread every Breast and will not the sacred Spark be communicated from Individuals to Governments and Legislatures: & from the Town of Philadelphia to every Town on the Continent? and from its Legislature to every other Legislature in the Union? With how much Pleasure and Justice could I expatiate on this acceptable Service of the fair! but to one of your Sensibility it is unnecessary. Your feelings will take the Load of my Pen; and your own Imagination beggar my feeble Praises.  I woud not have you suppose that I do not feel a heavy Load of anxious Solicitude on the State of our publick affairs. They press hard upon us: but the Means of Safety under Heaven are in our power, and I trust we have yet a portion of Virtue sufficient to draw JUNE 16, 1780  them forth into successful Exertion. The House you say is in the mean time on Fire-true! but the Cry is gone forth & the common danger will produce needful Succour.  I cannot but think that the Committee of which you are at the Head have effected very essential Services in our Cause by giving a true Idea of our Wants and or prospects. They will require a high Degree of Glory if they persevere and discharge their Trust to its fullest Extent. You my dear Sir peculiarly are placed in a conspicuous Station: because it is a Station to which you are fully competent and on the Execution of the Duties of which much, very much depends: and because the publick and Confidence is preengaged for every Measure you shall recommend.  I have exerted myself in procuring for you some Segars. They are too valuable to be forwarded at a Hazard. Let me know where I shall send them.  Present my most respectful Complims to Mrs Schuyler & the Circle of our Friends and believe me to be always, My dear Sir, with very great Regard Your affecte & most Obt Servt,  Jas Duane  ""

  Sir Philadelphia June 16th. 1780. Since I had the honor of addressing you last,(1) Congress have re- JUNE 16, 1780  ceived dispatches from General Lincoln, and I am sorry the contents are not so agreeable as we cou'd wish, the enemy are in possession of Charlestown, yet, I have no reason to think but what the General & our little brave army did all that cou'd be expected under their circumstances; for particulars respecting the capitulation, I beg leave to refer you to the printed paper, 'tho' not published by the authority of Congress (because it did not come to hand time enough to be in this paper) yet, I think the articles of capitulation are nearly the same.  By letters lately received from General Washington, I perceive he is under apprehensions that he should be obliged to withdraw the army under his immediate command to the southward of the Delaware for want of supplies; and if that shou'd be the case, the states of New York & N. Jersey will be greatly distressed; and I understand the important posts on the highlands are in great danger for want of provision; But as I expect the bearer of this will bring you another earnest address of Congress, it may be unnecessary for me to add.  It gives me sensible satisfaction to hear of the exertions of the state of Pennsylvania, & the citizens here in particular who are contributing largely for the relief of the army; I am informed the President of the state is preparing to take the field, at the head of a large number of his militia in case the enemy advance.  Congress has directed General Gates to take the command in the southern department.  I have the honor to be, with the highest respect, Sir, your most obedient servant; S. Holten (2)  ""

  Sir, Philada. 16June 1780 Your Excellency's Favour of the 13th inst. I received the same Day When you wrote the President of Congress on the 11th inclosing Lord Sterling's of the 10th, we took the earliest opportunity next Morning to bring the Question for sending a reinforcement of Militia JUNE 16, 1780  from this State into New-Jersey, under Debate.(1) There is the utmost readiness in Congress to make the requisition, and in the Executive of the State to comply with it, but the Scantiness of Supplies makes it necessary to avoid as much as possible, for this Moment, multiplying numbers beyond what is absolutely essential. However that every Thing might be in the utmost Forwardness for an Occasion, a large Body have Orders to be in momently readiness, and will, I hope, march with alacrity on the shortest notice. By a Letter from New Jersey received Yesterday, I am informed that the Commander in Chief has dismissed all the militia, except fifteen Hundred for special reasons, which I suppose to be the State of the Supplies and to prevent the improper appearances of dropping off without orders added to the Expediency of their being at Home as much as possible that they may turn out when wanted, with more readiness. The Militia have obtained the highest Credit on this Occasion, every Body speaks in Terms of Commendation concerning them.  There remains no longer any Doubt of the Fate of Charlestown. Lt Colonel Ternant arrived Night before last with General Lincoln's Dispatches.(2) The whole material Substance is published by the Enemy at New-York, and will be found in the inclosed Paper, which doubtless your Excellency will have been informed of before this reaches you. The Numbers are exaggerated, but every Thing else is pretty exact. It appears that every idle Excuse and unfair Contrivance has been used to detain Mr. Ternant, and as to the vessel stipulated to General Lincoln, and in which he comes himself, we have heard nothing of it. Honour and Faith has, I apprehend, been committed in Order to keep us in Uncertainty. But this is not unusual with the Enemy. Whatever Particulars have not yet been communicated will be published as soon as possible officially.  It remains now that we make the best of this Disaster, and I am of opinion, that instead of being a Detriment when considered on the general Scale, by proper Attention, we may turn it to Benefit. Deeply is to be regretted the Loss of a meritorious General, a brave Garrison and a large Supply of Stores; but if this arouses us to double Exertions, the Effect will be in our Favour finally. Providence has always appeared most eminently in our Favour, and we have ever exerted ourselves with most Spirit when pressed with Losses and Difficulties, and it is reasonably to be hoped this will soon be repaired.  Mr. Woodruft returns to-day. We have procured from the Board of War a Ton of Powder, five Cwt of it Cannon Powder, and also twenty Reams of Cartridge Paper. The publick stores cannot supply us, at this Time, with Lead, but if I am not mistaken we have a tolerable supply on Hand, as much as is equivalent to our Powder with this addition. We have also, I think, Cannon Shot and Flannel for making up the Cannon Cartridges. Besides this the Board of War   have sent to the Army a very large Quantity of fixed Ammunition out of which they have directed a Supply to the Militia. This was on request from Head-Quarters. The Board of war seem disposed to give any Thing to our Militia that they have and can possibly spare from the Army, observing very truly that it is the same general Object. It is earnestly to be wished that great Care may be taken both in securing and in the Consumption of military Stores, for they are imported with great Risque, Difficulty and Expense, and the State must without Doubt account in Settlement for them.  The County of Gloucester, a little before the Attack on Red-bank in 1777 lent the Garrison at that Place twelve Cwt of Powder, and upwards of thirteen Cwt of Lead. The Powder was repaid two Days ago, and the Lead will also as soon as the State of the Stores will admit. This helps along, though it is not the general Property of the State.  I scarcely think any Descent of Magnitude will be made in Monmouth unless a large Number of the Troops have returned from the Southward. It is difficult to decide what Proportion of their Troops they will send back to New-York. Many Circumstances invite them to push Operations in the Carolinas and Georgia, though this last is probably all at their Command already; nor do I think of any Thing that would bring them back at present but the Expectation of a French Fleet, orders received from Europe or the discouraging Summer Climate of the South. A short Time will probably decide and much depends upon it. General Gates is ordered to take the Command in the Southern Department.(3)  I hope your Excellency's Family has removed, it is certainly dangerous they should remain in the Enemy's reach, however they may have escaped hitherto.  A Council of Safety Bill, or Something of that Nature I think indispensible, and hope the Provision necessary for the Crisis will be made before the Legislature rises.  I have the Honour to be, your Excellencys obedt Servant  Wm Churchill Houston  ""

  Dear Sir Philadelphia 16th June 1780 The loss of Charlestown & the wants of the army have occasioned a general alarm here, from which I promise myself such exertions as will make us rise superior to the dangers which threaten us. A few days ago Mr. Meredith & Grason being at table with us we went largely into the state of our supplies, when I happened to drop a wish that the Merchants of this place would undertake a temporary supply upon their own credit Congress countersecuring them. Grason pushed it, Meredith embraced it, & upon its being broke to the Merchants they appointed a committee to consider the proposition & I imagine upon good ground that they will undertake for four million of rations. Should this go thro' it may not only help to releive our present necessities but put matters in such a train as we may find it convenient to keep them in.(1)  As to what you observe upon the propriety of an expedition to Canada in case of N Y. being put out our reach I think it is at least in the present State of our affairs a very disputable point.(2) Should the enimy quit Charlestown with a weak garrison I shd. concieve that we might act with more advantage in that quarter-And thus reenstate our affairs & at least [. . .] the account of prisoners & success. From the measures of the enimy to the southward as far as we can learn them, it seems doubtful whether they do not mean to push JUNE 16, 1780  their conquests there & rely upon the strength of their navy at home for preventing the force from France from coming over, or for following them & extending their operations. They have advanced a party to Georgetown nor had any part of them embarked the 26 of May. All seems to be submission in South Cariolina. Govr. Rutledge has dismiss'd his militia least they should be found in arms. But as far as I can understand North Carolina & Virginia begin to shew signs of life. If they rouse and shake themselves they will not fail to appear formidable to the enimy.  I am apprehensive for the post in the highlands, how are they commanded? Not I hope by Heath? Genl. Howe I have not the pleasure of much acquaintance with him. He by no means stands high with his countrymen. For God sake give some attention to this business, it is not less important than a supply of men or provisions.  I say nothing of the fair because as you inform me you have no time to think of them & I am much in the same predicament myself. Beside that most of those I love (perhaps I should have said esteem) are out of town. You will easily believe me when I assure you that I anxiously wish it were in my power to execute your commission but alas, Delaware flows between us.

  Sir, Philadelphia,16th June 1780.  We do ourselves the honour to enclose the last resolution of Con- JUNE 16, 1780  gress relative to the New Hampshire Grants.(1) We sincerely wish it had been in our power to proceed at an earlier day, but an exparte hearing would have been of little use to us. And to have pushed it with too much warmth would have answered no other purpose than to expose us to the censure of wishing to take advantage of our antagonists, especially as New Hampshire which has hitherto gone with us, threw its whole weight against us.  The loss of Charlestown, & the great scarcity of supplies has rendered our situation extreamly critical, and calls for the utmost exertion. Congress have endeavoured to rouse this by every means in their power, particularly by a circular Letter which you will receive with this.2 We feel for the situation of our state, threatned on one side & actually invaded on another. We submit it to the judgment of the Legislature whether they should not continue sitting till the storm is overblown.  We conceive that not a moment should be lost in sending forward the bill for the adoption of the resolution of Congress of the 18 of March last as considerable advantage may be derived both to the state & the continent from the sums that may be procured by the exchange of their bills.3 And as the preparing them is a matter which will take some time, & those who send on their laws are to have the preferance, expedition becomes an object of some moment.  We have no account from the southward of the enimies having yet embarked any part of their force; they have detatched a body of them as far as Georgetown. The people of South Carolina will give them little opposition, tho' we have great hopes that the approach of the enimy will rouse N. Carolina to the exertions of which she is fully capable. We forgot to mention, that it would be proper to send up with our law, the name of some person who is to sign on the part of Congress that we may recommend him so that no time may be lost on that account. This we presume will be the Loan officer but it may be well to have a second in case of accidents. We have the honor to be, with the greatest respect your Excellency's Most Obt. Hum. Serv'ts, Robt.

  Dear Sir. Philadelphia June 18th. 1780. When I had the honour to write your Excellency from Morristown,(1) I wished our Publick affairs, to wear a more Pleasing aspect, before I wrote you again. Which moment hath in some measure arived; tho far from being so promising as I could wish. The heart felt distress, for the salvation of our Country; hath been visible in the Countenance of all her true Friends. Char[l]estown with all the shiping & stores in the hands of the Enemy, Seven General officers, and near one Quarter part of our Continental Troops; Prisoners of War. General Kniphausen in Jersey, at the head of a Superiour Army, to General Washington, endeavoring to force his way to Morristown: where were all the Artilery and stores of the Army, and not one publick Horse to move them. General Clinton hourly expected, and that West point would be his object, in which there was not one pound of provision. Our Army in Jersey only fed from day to day, the Militia could not be called to the field for want of Provisions. This was the Situation of our publick affairs untill within a few days. At present every friend to their Country, both Male & Female appear to be roused (in this part of the Country) either upon the principals of Honour, virtue, or danger, to make an Common defence, which you will see by the inclosed papers, to which I beg liberty to refer  JUNE 18, 1780  you. And I can asure your Excellency that the publick measures they contain are real. And I flatter my self the state of Rhode Island according to her ability will not be behind the foremost in adopting every patriotick measure tending to promote our common defence. We have, at present a promising aspect of the Armys being supplied with provision by the Exertion that are making in the states we have heard from. Congress do not entertain a doubt of the New England states exerting themselves. I flatter my self your Excellency met the General Assembly possessed with every sentiment necessary for carrying into immediate execution every requisition of Congress and their Committee at Head Quarters. How far they have adopted them I wish to be informed.(2) It is agreed on all hands the whole state of S. Carolina hath submited to British Government as well as Georgia. And I shall not be surprized to hear N. Carolina hath followed their example. In a word we have but little to expect South of Maryland, the once patriotick state of Virginia weighs but little at present in the scale of Defence, Or furnishing of men or Supplies, her whole attention is ingrosed in making sale of her out lands. The little state of Rhode Island hath loaned more money to the Continent then every state south of this. Which will I apprehend cause a great difficulty in liquadateing the Loan office Certificates. I have moved in Congress for a warrant in favour of the state for the money due on the state accompt. It is refered to the Treasury Board they have not reported and I fear they will not soon.(3) The demands on the Continental Treasury is Twenty times as much as they at present can pay. But you may rest asured nothing on my part shall be left undone to obtain the warrant. At the same time as a Friend to and a Member of the state I must beg they will pay no more money on Continental accompt than is absolutely necessary for the salvation of the Country. I fore see so many unthought of difficulties in the Settlement of those Accompts that I fear the state will be a great sufferer in what is paid already. It is impossible for Congress at present to enter upon Comercial affairs therefore I have made no Motion in consequence of the Instruction I receivd from the Council of War,(4) but I find that by the desire of Congress our minister at the Court France had the 11 th & 12th articles of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce expunged; & Both Nations left to lay what duties they pleased for which we may thank our Breathern in the Southern states. The different policy, of the several states and two many of them turning all their views to their own advantage without consulting the Common good, Cause some able Politicians to think that our Political Salvation, in a great measure depends on a controuling power, over the whole, being lodged in some person or persons. I wish to have your Excellencys Sentiments upon this subject, before the matter is taken up in Congress which I think will be soon, as the Union is too much disolved in some of our Sister States, what ever [your] sentiments may be will  be my line of Conduct [....] I fear the ability of the state to carry the sever[al propo]sitions into execution. I hope nothing will be [neglected?] that is probable. You may rest asured if our Indep[endence] is established N. England must do their full proport[ion] as there is not that uninimity, in the southern states, th[at I cou]ld wish. There is many more circumstances [to c]ommunicate to you but having already sp[un this] letter to a great length and perhaps been more pa[rticular] than some may think necessary, but when I know it is the wish of my Constituents I shall endeavour to gratify them in a more particular manner.

  My Dear Sir, Philadelphia June 18th 1780 On my way hither(1) I found at Trenton fifteen hundred Barrels of flour and learnt two hundred more were at Borden town, the whole detained for want of Carriages. I requested an audience of both branches of the legislature which they readily Granted, urged the necessity of their Immediate attention to provide the means of transporting the flour to the army, Kings ferry or New Windsor, and to procure whatever they could within the State and to forward It without delay. I dwelt on the danger the states were exposed to from the greatly reduced State of the Army, pointed at the extra-expence Occassioned by the necessity of frequently drawing to and detaining the Militia in the field, Observed how heavy that service must Inevitably fall on the States In the vicinity of the Enemys main post unless the Army was Effectually and Speedily reinforced, Remarked that altho we had abundant resources yet If every state would depend that others should take the lead nothing would be done and ruin to all must be the Consequence; and added every Argument which occured to Impel them to Instantanous Exertions. I obtained Explicit promises that they would without a moments delay procure Carriages to Convey the flour there as I had requested-that they would take measures to Collect all that could possibly be spared from the Inhabitants, which they apprehended was not any Considerable quantity-That the Completion of their line would Claim their unremitted Attention-And that they would In every Instance and with great alacrity Comply with the requisitions which had been made of them, as far as they were in condition to furnish the Supplies. On my arrival here I waited on Mr. President Reed and entered into a full and minute disscussion of our Affairs, and decidedly declared, that unless the States paid Stricter Attention to the requisitions of Congress than had hitherto been done by any of them, and furnished the Supplies allotted to them to provide that the Contest could not be maintained, that disgrace and ruin must ensue. He appeared Alarmed, promised Every thing should be done that depended on him, but I could not draw forth any Assurances that the requisitions  JUNE 18, 1780  made from this State would be complied with. Indeed I fear we shall not receive them, I mean thro the Authority of the State. The Merchants are however roused. Mr Robert Morris is at the head of an Association for the purpose of furnishing the Army with three Millions of rations, for which the public is to reimburse them as soon as their finances will admit.(2) They have yesterday sent on five hundred barrels of Flour which is to be transported by Carriages to be hired by Mr. Meredith and another Gentleman from Trenton to Kings Ferry or Windsor. Reflecting how Exceedingly your Excellency is pressed with business I have taken the liberty to advise the board of war to desire Gen.

Congress who are eternally penelopyzing have directed that no Corn should be sent to this Quarter from Virginia, unless the Governor of that State Judges that It can be spared from the Southern army. I have Observed to the Virginia Gentlemen now here that In the present Scarcity of forrage to the Northward, and which will Increase until the Rye harvest, It will be Impracticable to put any Considerable army In motion, unless Virginia Sends us Sixty thousand Bushells, they have promised to recommend It to Governor Jefferson .(3)  Gen.

  In Committee of Congress, Morris Town  Sir, Circular, No. 5 June 19th., 1780.  We inclose you a copy of General Washingtons letter to us of this day.' We have in our former letters dwelt so forcibly on the several matters contained in the generals letter, that it is now become almost unnecessary for us to say any thing more on them. But when we consider the season for operation wears fast away; the small force we now have in the field, being still fed in a scanty and uncertain manner, the hourly expectation of the fleet and Army of our Ally, on our coast, And that the Commander in Chief, as well as ourselves, are as yet totally uninformed what are to be our expectations on the subject of our former letters; Be assured, Sir, we feel an anxiety congenial with his, you will therefore, we are persuaded, pardon us for being thus solicitous, when we again intreat you in the most earnest, in the most urgent manner, to use every exertion in your power to engage your state, to a speedy and decisive complyance  JUNE 19, 1780  with our former requisitions. The two points we would wish to impress most forcibly on yours, and the minds of the legislature of your state, are immediately forwarding your quota of troops, necessary to complete your batalions in the Continental Army, and of supplies of provision agreable to the estimates inclosed you in our letter of the 2d Instant, at the same time, we would not wish you to consider any part of our former requisitions as become in the least degree unnecessary; on the contrary, we are more strongly convinced that they are already as small as the important objects in view, can possibly admit of; we only mention the two first as the most immediately, and indispensibly necessary, for reinforced as the enemy now are, by the return of their troops from the reduction of Charles Town, we momently expect an attack will be made on our weak and almost resistless Army; Should this event happen whilst in this state, we seriously dread the result.  From the well known indefatigable attention of your state to the welfare of the United States, we cannot entertain a doubt of its exertions, at this interesting conjuncture, and we most earnestly intreat you to give us the earliest information of the final determination of your state, on the subject of this, and our former letters.(2)  We are Sir, with the highest respect, Your most Obedt.

  Sr. Philadelphia June l9th. 1780  I received your letter of the 27th of May the day before yesterday, and this day laid the same before Congress. It was referred to a Committee who are to report thereon.(1)  Although the requisition was by Several of the members in the Course of the debate allowed to be just, yet all but the delegates of Massachusetts Bay opposed it being granted at Present on account of the Critical situation we are in for Want of money to feed the JUNE 19, 1780  army. I urged that by a resolution of Congress Massachusetts Bay had been allowed to Retain two millions of their quota of taxes on account of the Penobscot expedition (2)-and that the same line of Conduct ought to be observed with regard to us as to them, but the minds of Congress are so intirely occupied with the distresses of the army as to render them inattentive to the Voice of reason and justice, and therefore it will bee some time I fear before any thing will bee done to effect.  In the Course of the next week I expect to procure our quota of the new emission of money to be forwarded to Hartford in Connecticut by Oliver Ellsworth Esqr. who lives in Hartford and is a delegate of that State, and if I Can will agree with him to transmit it from thence to our State.

  Dr Doctr. Philadelphia June 21st 1780 I wrote you by the post Fryday last (1) inclosed you have this days JUNE 21, 1780  paper. Inteligence from the Jerseys to day is that Clinton had arrived at New York with part of his Army from S Carolina. That he had sent two regiments over to Elizabeth Town point to reinforce the Army there and that it was Conjectured he would Immediately proceed up the north River against West Point. He seems to be acting with vigor, but all his Efforts I am persuaded will be ineffectual. Nothing but Exertion on our side was wanting And all ranks of people Seem now to be properly Annimated. The Jersey, York and Pensilvania Militia are turning out fast. The merchants and other Inhabitants of this Town (to their immortal honour be it spoken), have undertaken to Supply the Army With provisions, and rum for two months at their own present Expense and are sending it forward very fast. They have raised £300,000 hard money. They are hereafter to be refunded by Congress. This is a most Seasonable assistance and will give time to lay in proper Supplys by the time the two months are expired. A patriotic flame is Kindled too Amongst the Ladys. They have raised £200,000 for the encouragement of the officers & Soldiers in the Continental Army, which is to be deposited in the hands of Mrs. Reed the Presidents Lady, to be by her delivered to Mrs. Washington, to be put into the hands of the General. A Delegate to Congress from N. Carolina arrived here last night.(2) He says that General Cornwallace with 5200 men with some field peices is making a rapid March through S. Carolina, that he had defeated Colo. Beaufort who Commanded about 300 men, near Camden, had Killed and taken about 170, that he was expected to penetrate into N. Carolina but that 4000 of the Militia of that State had embodied & with the assistance of the Virginians and the regular troops belonging to the Maryland and Delaware line, they should be able to give a good Account of them which God grant.

  Dear Sr. June 21? 1780](1) I have your favour of the 31st ult (2) in answer to my several Letters and was then impressed with and still feel great anxiety on account of our public affairs. The present distress is to be ascribed in great part to the resolution not to issue any more Bills of Credit before a sufficiency of money was provided and supplies secured for the army. Had proper precaution been taken in these matters, and the new scheme of Finance been ready for the public consideration, the determination not to increase the quantity of money and the alteration introduced by the new System would not have been so sensibly felt or occasioned the distress in the several Departments they have produced. From these I think we are nearly emerging as the new money is coming into use in the several States and will probably greatly relieve us. But by these and several other proceedings Congress have been gradually surrendering or throwing upon the several States the exercise of powers they should have retained and to their utmost have exercised themselves-untill at length they have scarse a power left but such as concerns foreign Transactions, for as to the Army the Congress is at present little more than the Medium through which the wants of the Army are conveyed to the States. This Body never had or at least in few instances have exercised powers adequate to the purpose of War And such as they had, have been from embarrasment and difficulties frittered away to the States and it will be found I fear very difficult to recover them. A Resolution passed the other day desiring the States to inform us what they had done upon certain requisitions for some time past that we might know what we had to rely on.(3) This may probably serve as a Basis for assuming powers should the answers afford an opening. Other resolutions are now before Us (4) by one of them the States are desired to give express powers for calling forth men provisions money for carrying on the war for the common defence-others go to the assumption of them imediately-the first I have no doubt will pass this Body but will I expect sleep with the States, the others I believe will dye where they are-for so cautious are some of offending the States in this respect a Gentleman the other day plainly told us, [upon?] a proposition to order some armed vessells to search the vessells going out to prevent the exportation of Flour, that if an Embargo was laid in the Delaware as in this State he consented to the measure, otherwise he never wd. agree to such exercise of power.  The Merchant Bankers in this city are making generous exertions to procure and send forward to the Army a Supply of Flour and will afford us great help in that article.(5) The Massachusetts Delegates read us Letters whereby it appears their State have raised 4000 Men for the Army and are embodying 4000 more to be ready if wanting. (6)  JUNE 22, 1780  Gates, Weedon and Morgan are ordered to the Southern Department. 5000 Militia are required from Virginia to join that Army and 3000 to be held in readiness-from No. Carolina 4000 and two thousand to be held in readiness-2500 of the Virginia Militia were to march yesterday.(7) By our accounts it would seem that States are somewhat roused from their slumber, but have rejected the Scheme of Finance of the 18th March last wch. I fear will have a bad effect on the Credit of the money of the other States that have agreed to the measure.(8) Governor Jefferson has transmitted us a State of the Virginia Troops taken from the last returns by wch. it appears we have in the different Corps 4011 men in Service to the 30th Sept. & for the War or longer period than the 30th Sept. next, including those captured in Charles Town. This surprises me but the fact appears to be so and where they are or what has become of them is strange. I cannot inform you whether our Legislature have ordered a Draught to fill up the deficiencies as we have no Mail this week from the Southward it stoping at Annapolis for want of a Rider to bring it to this place, the Late Rider having quited the Business.(9) With great esteem I am, Dr. Sr., Yr. obt. hum.

  Dear Sir Trentown 22d June 1780  My anxiety for the supplies of the army have brought me to this place in order that I might satisfy myself as to the quantity on hand, & the means of forwarding them. Genl. Nox has communicated to me your Excellencys orders on this subject. Nothing short of this would I am fully persuaded be of sufficient force to produce the desired effect-And knowledge of them will in a great measure render the execution of them unnecessary-impressed with this Idea, I have been long labouring to bring Congress to assume the power which will enable them to call forth the resources of the States but unhappily without effect.(1) However I hope much from their pressing & reiterated demands. What principally induced me to trouble your Excellency at this time is an apprehention which I, in common with many other gentlemen, entertain of the propriety of leaving the command at West point in the Hands of Genl. Howe.(2) Having no personal acquaintance with him I can have no prejudices. But the Gent. from the Southward by no means speake so favourably of him as I could wish. But independent of this I conceive that as he has yet had no opportunity of acquiring a military character-that Confidence which is so necessary to inspire courage especially in militia will I JUNE 22, 1780  fear be wanting in him. I might presume so far I shd. beg leave to submit it to yr Excellency whether this post might not be most safely confided to Genl. Arnold whose courage is undoubted-who is the favourite of our militia, & who will agree perfectly with our Govr. Your Excellency will not consider this as designed to convey the most disreflection on Genl. Howe, of whom I know nothing but by report which may very possibly be ill grounded. But if the most distant doubt remains in a matter of so much moment I conceive it should be removed. I make no other appology for the liberty I take than the motive that suggests it-which has before now induced your Excellency to pardon an interference in matters to which I was no [more?] competent than the present. This hasty letter is written while the express waits whom I am unwilling to detain longer than while I declare the extream respect & esteem with which I am Your Excellencys Most Obt Hum.

Impressed with the necessity of giving you the earliest information of every important occurence; We therefore inclose you a copy of a letter from the Commander in Chief, this moment received.(1)  From the accumulated Distresses of our Army, which we are daily spectators of; The jeapardy we have twice seen them in, and the fatal  JUNE 23, 1780  consequences that must have resulted from a defeat, (which would inevitably have been the consequence, had the enemy at first, and still will be, should they even now pursue their object) We are constrained, again to call on you in the most pressing manner, to forward your quota of men and supplies agreable to our estimate of the 2d Instant, and prevent the total sacrifice of the few brave and intriped spirits that at present compose our Army, and avoid the indelible strain that must consequently be fixed on those states, should such an event take place. (Thus far Circular)  To the States of Pensylvania, and New Jersey.  That part of the Generals letter respecting the state of the stores here, is a matter of such pressing necessity, that we conceive it to be our duty to give the earliest attention to it. The situation of the magazines at this post, is truely deplorable, the enemy are certainly pushing at them, and we are in no condition to move them for want of teams. If they do not effect their purpous at this time, it is evident they mean to persist until the situation of our affairs renders it necessary for the remains of our Army to move from hence, when there will be no impediment to the execution of their plan. We therefore hope, Sir, you will enable the officers of the department to improve this interval so as to effect their removal to a place of greater safety, by having the teams which are requested of your state immediately sent forward.

The Enemy have gained some advantages to the Southward since JUNE 23, 1780  the surrender of Charlestown; but it is to be hoped from the exertions now making in North Carolina & Virginia that they will not be able to proceed much farther. The Enemy in Jersey remained on the 20th of this month inactive at Elisabeth Town point. It is certain a fleet has returned to New York from Charlestown & according to the best information yet obtained has brot. General Clinton & a considerable part of his Troops. It is said that Admiral Arbuthnot is also returned.  General Lincoln arived this day at Congress & has requested an enquiry into his conduct in the loss of Charlestown.(1)  Mr. Lawrence having been prevented going to Holland, Mr. John Adams, or if inconvenient for him, Mr. Dana is authorised to transact the business there until Mr. Lawrence or some other appointed in his room shall arive.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia June 23d 1780 Nothing material has taken place since my last. The fact is confirmed that Clinton has returned to N.Y. with part of the Southern army, and has joined Kniphausen. They are at present manoeuvering for purposes not absolutely known, but most probably in order to draw Genl Washington to an action in which they suppose he may be disabled to give the necessary co-operation to the french armament. Could they succeed in drawing him from his strong position, the result indeed ought to be exceedingly feared. He is weak in numbers beyond all suspicion, and under as great apprehension from famine as from the Enemy. Unless very speedy & extensive reinforcements are resvd. from the Eastern States which I believe are exerting themselves, the issue of the Campain must be equally disgraceful to our Councils & disgustful to our Allies. Our greatest hopes of being able [to] feed them are founded on a patriotic scheme of the opulent Merchts. of this City who have already subscribed nearly £3,000,000 and will very soon complete that sum, the immediate object of which is to procure and transport to the Army 3,000,000,000 of rations(1) and 300 Hhds of rum. Congress for the support of this bank and for the security and indemnification of the Subscribers, have pledged the faith of the United States & agreed to deposit Bills of Exchange on Europe to the Amount of £150,000 Sterling, which are not however to be made use of unless other means of discharging this debt shd. be inadequate.

The enemy advanced yesterday in great force (supposed to be 5000) under the Command of Knyphausen; as far as Springfield, burnt the whole of that pretty village except two or three houses. They were opposed by a few (about 700) of our brave fellows, with a few Militia. But when they had driven us as far as the short Hills, & our people took post there with a firm & resolute countenance, they did not think proper to attack us on this ground but immediately retreated. They once attempted to advance up to us, but whether they did not feel bold, or that they conceived there could be glory gained, by Skivering a handful of ragamuffins I won't undertake to say. But they certainly turn'd tail on us. I was down a part of the time, but did not stay long. I saw this last manuvre.

  Sir, Morristown 24th June 1780 Altho I have Scarce time to write a single word except what relates to official Transactions and of course am deprived the happiness of private correspondence, Yet when I reflect how various and uncertain common reports are with regard to matters and things And how agreable it must be for you Sir and the rest of my friends to have early & direct intelligence of the momentous Manoeuvres & retrograde Manoeuvres of the Enemy Especially at this Critical Conjuncture, Am Constrain'd to rob the Couch of a few dreary midnight moments, to give some imperfect hints relative to the late movements of the Enemy.  JUNE 24, 1780  The Committee wrote you yesterday by their Circular letter inclosing Copy of a letter recd. from the Commander in Chief, but as the fate of the day was then undetermined nothing particular could be observed, except what was contained in his Exclys Letter affore alluded to.  For several days past Genl Washington had been extending the left wing of his Army several miles to the North-That the Enemy whose numbers Since the return of Sr. Harry with his Troops from the Southward, flushed with Conquest, are very Considerable, might not out flank him with their Right wing, so as to Cut off all communication from North to South, and in order also if possible to prevent them from getting possession up the North river.  Yesterday Early in the morning Genl. Kniphausen with 13 Regts Consisting of about 5,000 regular troops, exclusive of some Corps of New levies, advanced from Eliza. Town point, upon our Right wing Commanded by Majr. Genl. Greene.  The progress of the Enemy was Slow-At least Six hours moving from the point to Springfield which is about Eight miles-Did but little mischief on their march-When they arrived were checked by the Spirited Conduct of a few Continentals & some millitia, who gave them so warm a reception, they thought proper to halt-And began in their usual Heroic Humane manner to plunder, burn, kill and destroy, the defensless and almost deserted Town, and Continued till every house was Consumed except 2 or 3. At about Six Clock P.M. they returned toward Eliza. Town. At 11 Ck. they arrived at the point from whence they took their departure in the morning- and from which they had a bridge of boats across the River to Steatan Island. At one this morning they began their retreat over to the Island which they completed before it was light-it is said they have taken the boats apart which formed the bridge.  It is my opinion Clinton has, or, is about to make a rapid movement up the North river, And if Join'd by Genl Kniphausen his force Cannot be less than 12,000 regular Troops, perhaps more, and three or 4 thousand of levies. Time only can discover what may be the Consequences!!  The loss of kill'd & wounded on both Sides in the affair of Yesterday must be very Considerable, Col. Angel's R. Island Regt. & Col. Datons Regt have Suffered much-a Capt Thompson of Col. Lambs Regt. kill'd, regular returns not yet Recd.

  Dear Sr. Philadelphia June 27th. 1780 I do my self the honour to write your Excellency-tho, at the same time I am almost ready to beleive my letters are not agreable, As I have not received one line since I left the state.  Congress have taken up and settled the scale of depriciation upon which the Loan office Certificates are to be paid off, till those baring  JUNE 27, 1780  date on or before the first day of Sepr. 1777 are upon par with Silver and Gold, those dated March the 1st 1778 at one & three quarters, those on the 1st of Sepr. 1778 four for one, those on the first of March 1779 Ten for one, those on the first of Sepr. 1779 Eighteen for one, those on the Eighteenth of March 1780 Forty for one, And from period to period in Geomatrical proportion. This business hath taken up much time in Congress occasioned by the different interest in the states and individuals concerned, bad as it may be thought to be by some, it is the best that could be obtained.(1) It was become absolutely necessary to establish publick credit upon some baisis, Otherwise from appearance the Army will disband and our Country be lost. The embaresments of our publick measures are beyond discription owing to the want of money.  The merchants in this City offered Congress that they would supply the Army with 3,000,000 of Rations of provisions and Three hundred Hogsheads of Rum delivered in Camp, to be paid for in Six months with Interest at Six per cent per Annum. The offer is accepted,(2) the Merchants have subscribed a fund of £300,000 hard Money and are Sending the provisions forward, which I trust will give a momentary relief, At the same time it is to be hoped no one state will fail to exert themselves in forwarding their quotas of Supplies, As the Enemy build their greatest hopes on our not being able to feed an Army sufficent to look them in the face.  I have little incouragment that I shall be able to obtain any money on the States accompt. Massachusetts & N. Hampshire have since applied in the same manner but have as yet not been able to obtain any.(3) I wish some one of my Coleagues may arive soon, the State of Rhode Island is now the only State in the Union, that is represented by only one member, I shall be soon out of cash, the expense of Board in this place is beyond discription.  Mr. Ellery is appointed One of the Commissioners of the Board of Admiralty.(4) He hath also informed me that the General assembly Resolved (some time since) that toom stones should be erected to the Memory of Mr. Ward,(5) he hath nearly got the stones Compleated. Now calls on me to se the same finished. I wish your direction, and in order to se the work finished I must be furnished with between 3 & 4000 dollars.  There was a Severe Scirmish in Jersey on Fryday last between a party of the Enemy and a detachment of Our Army under the Command of Genl. Greene, from the best accounts no great advantage was gained on either side, the loss supposed to be considerable. It is said Colo. Angels Regt. behaved exceeding well, and have suffered greatly, no particulars have yet come to hand.

I have the Honour to be your Excellencys most obedient, Humble Servant, Ezekiel Cornell  NB Since writing the above the inclosed paper hath been published, which more fully explains some things I have mentioned.(6)  A resolution hath this moment pased Congress (7) ordering all moneys Loaned Since the 18th of March last and all further Sums that shall be loaned untill the further order of Congress, to be paid at Forty for One with Interest at Six per Cent per Annum untill paid.

Before this reaches you, you will no doubt have heard of your being called into service.(1) This I am sure will be agreeable to you, and may you render your country that service she stands in need of and that which I know you wish to do. Our affairs 'tis true are critical, but an adverse stroke is now and then necessary to rouse us to action. Our resources are undoubtedly sufficient and we want but exertions to work out our salvation. We are now roused and I hope the work will be finished before we fall into another fit of the lethargy. I think your scheme for recruiting our army an excellent one and wish with all my soul it were adopted. This and the neighbouring States are straining every nerve to bring the present campaign to a happy conclusion; let it not be said that Virginia was exceeded either in zeal or exertions by any one of them. Virginia has so distinguished herself in former times no less trying, that now the more is expected of her. The enemy have burnt Springfield, but were so roughly handled that they thought it prudent to return with a quick step to Elizabeth Town. 'Tis generally thought their next object will be West Point, but should they delay their operations a little longer, I think we shall be prepared for them at all points. Where in the name of Heaven are the Monsieurs all this time? We heard of their sailing from Brest the 9th of April.  Wherever the service of your Country may call you, I shall always rejoice to hear from you and shall not fail to answer your letters.

  Dear Tommy(1) Philadelphia 27 June 1780 I am at this time as well as expected and hope these will find you and all the family in like health.  I have not heard one Syllable from the family since I left it. I have wrote your mother three times, and Mr. Sumner once since I left home.(2) The mair stood the Journey better than the horse, she looked near as well when I arrived at Philadelphia, as when I left home & had more Spirit. The horse lost the most of his flesh by the time I had got to my Journeys end. This may be assigned to two reasons, viz. First to his being too young and secondly to his not having got seasoned to grass, and I don't know but I may assign a third namely his having had the horse distemper so lately. I have had him blooded, & hope he will recruit. His blood was Exceeding black. I arrived in this place the thirteenth of June about Eleven O.Clock which was the twelfth day after I set out. I rested the horse two days & a half, so that I was travelling but nine days, which was pushing rather too hard for so long a Journey; however I believe I have not hurt the horse. It is well I did not take the other horse for I immagine he would not have held out, Hope he answers for you as well as the  JUNE 28, 1780  mair, should be glad to know. I have nothing of news to write you, but refer you to the inclosed News Paper. If your mother has not received the letters I wrote her send by [. . .] at the Post office in Boston for them where I conclude you will find them.  Sincerely wish that you and all my family may Enjoy the Divine Presence and blessing through the whol Period of this life and Eternal felicity in that which is to come. Adieu, A. W.  N. B. You will conduct in all matters according to your best judgment & I dare say I shall have no reason to find fault. I wish you would let me know how you get along with your business &c. Give my kind love to all the family farewell.  ""

  In Committee of Congress, Morris Town, Gentlemen,(1) June 28, 1780.  We are this moment honored by the receipt of a letter of the 27th instant from the Commander in Chief, covering copy of your joint letter of the 22d, and addressed to his Excellency, with his answer.(2)  The committee duly impressed with the utility of augmenting the number of regular troops in the field-the cogency of the reasons by you adduced in favour of such augmentation, so far as they relate to your state, in preference to the mode pointed out by the Committee in their Circular letter of the 2d instant in concurrence with the Commander in Chief, for reinforcing the Army. Sensible of the peculiar embarrassments your state might be under, by endeavoring, at this time, to furnish the proposed quota of Militia, and wishing to calculate every measure to be adopted to the inclination and convenience of the States, are induced fully to coincide with the General in opinion respecting your propositions. Though, as the General observes, many inconveniencies will arise in consequence of so great a deduction from the force you were to have furnished, and if a proportionable dimunition should take place in the other states, although the men, thus furnished will be engaged upon a permanent footing, we are not without anxiety least our Army should be found JUNE 28, 1780  inadequate to the great objects in view. Our feelings have more than once been tortured, by seeing the General, with his little army, involved at a most critical moment in such complicated embarrassments as few Generals would have encountered, when at the same time his sensibility must have been greatly wounded by reflecting that this labyrinth of distress was in a great measure owing to the cruel neglect of those whose indispensible duty it was to have supported their cause by furnishing him with an Army and supplies equal to the exigency of the time; and the importance of establishing their independence, and bringing the war to a speedy and honorable termination; yet we are fully convinced such is his delicacy and candour, such his affectionate regard to the case and convenience of the state, that he would undergo every species of hardship and fatigue, run every risque that did not with temerity endanger a total loss of the Army; the consequences, inevitable to such an event, you will readily conceive. In short, that he would sacrifice every thing but his honor and integrity in support of the independence of these States, rather than they should be burthened by any unnecessary requisition. We shall therefore rely with the most intire confidence, that the condition and proposals mentioned [in the gen]erals letter to you, and upon which he was induced to accept the propositions of your state, will be most rigidly observed, and fully complied with on their part.  We have the honor to be, with the greatest respect & Esteem, Gentlemen, Your most Obedt. Hble Servts,  J. Mathews N. Peabody ""

  Sir, Philada June 29. 1780  The urgent Necessity of drawing into the public Treasury the ten Millions of Dollars mentioned in the Act of the l9th of May was so fully pointed out, that Congress exceedingly regret the Failure of this necessary Supply. The Conjuncture is already arrived when it is become essential not only to the Operations of this Campaign, but to the very Existence of the Army. Congress therefore can no longer delay reiterating the most importunate Solicitations, that the Proportions of each of the States be forwarded immediately. For this Purpose they have despatched a special Messenger, and they trust he will not meet with Disappointment.(1)  A further Sum must also be speedily had, or it will be impossible for the Operations to proceed. Congress have therefore drawn on these States for the remainder of their Quotas to the first of March last inclusive, and it is their Duty to conjure the several States, if they should be still unprepared, that they will at all Events transmit their Arrears to the Period last mentioned to the Continental Treasury within thirty Days from the Date of the Warrants.  The monthly Estimates of Money heretofore made were but barely sufficient at that Time, their Vallue has since greatly diminished & the Payment has been delayed long after it became due. These Circumstances have already involved our Affairs in much Perplexity, and driven to Expedients which nothing but the last Necessity could justify. Permanentcy & Arrangement in the public Finances must at every Hazard be introduced & supported. In this View Congress do again with the most earnest Solicitude press on the several States the Necessity of vigorous & decisive Measures for carrying into full & immediate Execution their resolutions of the 18th of March last, the Doing which, at the same Time that it places public Credit on the surest Basis, will in the Course of the Year give all the relief that could possibly result from a further Emission equal to the whole that is now in Circulation. These resolutions Congress are perswaded are every Day better understood, and that upon giving them their full Effect very much depends the final Establishment of our Liberties. It is unnecessary that Congress should suggest to the several States the Expediency of providing by Loans against any Deficiency they may have reason to apprehend from their Taxes.  The blank Bills for the several States will be forwarded as fast as the Acts of their Assemblies-providing Funds for them are transmitted to Congress.  By Order of Congress, S.H.  ""

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia, 29th June, 1780. I should be very much mortified if I were to ascribe your silence to neglect, but I know the diversity of business that has engaged your attention for some time past, & do not wonder if amidst the hurry of great affairs the little calls of private friendship sh'd be forgot. It gave me sensible pleasure to find from the great superiority of ballots in your favor at the last election, that the people notwithstanding the endeavours of some designing men are disposed to do justice to your merrits.  I am sorry to find that in passing the finance bill, no provission has been made for exchanging money, as this w'd enable you to answer the demands of Congress which are extreamly pressing & at the same time put some money in the treasury without too much disstressing the inhabitants by taxes; it was for this purpose the words by taxes or otherwise were inserted in the resolution. If the legislature are sitting, I wish a supplemental bill may pass immediately; if not I think that the necessity would justify you in ordering the treasurer to do it till they met, as it never was the Idea of any of us that you could raise the whole sum demanded by tax.  I wrote to you on the subject of my tax. (1) am informed that instead of nine thousand it is nearly £15000, so that my annual tax am's to upwards of £50,000; my income is not £10,000. I do not wish to get rid of any burthen which others bear; all I ask is that the Legislature will not suffer advantage to be taken of the absence of their servants; but either have the charge open till I am [at] liberty to return & controvert it, or by making the proper inquiries themselves do me justice.  We have information of the arrival of a very formidable Spanish armament in the West Indies, so that we have all the reason in the world to suppose that some decisive blow will be struck there after the hurricane months are over; England will have more upon her hands than she.can cleverly manage, and I think we have all the reason imaginable to believe, that if we make exertions any way adequate to the occasion, this will be a decisive campaign.  We have been in pain for West Point, (2) but I hope that we have now nothing to fear from that quarter, as we hear that our line are  JUNE 30, 1780  returned & that the posts are strongly reinforced. Should they be attacked I hope by the blessing of Heaven that our militia under your Excellency's command may acquire equal glory & be crowned with more success than they were in the last attack.

  Dear Sir. Philadelphia June 30th. 1780. I was favored with yours by Genl. Schuyler(1) & intended to have done myself the pleasure of writing to you by him, but he sit out sooner than I expected.  You mention that you have not the last returns. Dr. Brown, I think, made two returns of the Medical Gentlemen not long since, & as I have but one of them I did suppose you had the other, as I tho't I had some remembrance of your taking of one: the return I have is at this time wanted by the comittee, as they are considering what Gentlemen are most proper to join the Southern Army; but if you stand in need of the return, I will send it or a copy; I inclose you a late resolution of Congress respecting the department:(2) And the comittee have wrote to Dr. Brown(3) directing him to let them know the state of the middle district, & what stores & medicines are absolutely necessary; Mr. Henry of Virginia is added to the committee, & we are doing all in our power to afford supplies.  It gives me concern that the General shou'd be under embarrasments from a resolution of Congress,(4) & I gave it as my opinion to Genl. Schuyler that it might be removed, but it has not been mentioned in Congress.  It is a great misfortune to our country, that when we shou'd have our armies in the field, we have the men to raise & money & supplies to collect, and 'tho' I am not disposed to find fault with any, yet I think there has been delays, & we must now suffer the consequences.

  Dear Sr. Phila. 30th June 1780 The Troops left by Sr. Henry Clinton in South Carolina amounting to about 3500 Men besides 1500 sent to Georgia cannot be sufficient unless increased by the accession of Tories, to overawe that State, especially when the Inhabitants shall find themselves supported by the Regulars and Militia going to their assistance. The 5000 Militia recommended by Congress to be raised by Virga. to join the Southern Army including the 2500 then or about to be raised and the additional Body to be kept in readiness,(1) if your intelligence corresponds with the above state of the Enemies Strength cannot now be necessary the requisition being made upon a supposition a much greater Force would have continued in South Carolina. The alteration of circumstances will justify an alteration of measures and by lessening the Draughts of Militia increase the number of Recruits for the Regular Army. Upon it and not upon Militia is our great dependence. Besides the caling forth, if it can be safely avoided, such large Bodies of Militia lessens the productions of the Earth and generally produces great distress to a number of Families. Sr. Henry Clintons proclamation exempting the Inhabitants of S. Carolina not taken in the Town from their paroles, evinces his design and expec- JUNE 30, 1780  tation of gaining the people to his side, and that they will take up Arms in support of the British Government. It is not improbable his threats and promises may in their present unsupported situation induce many to do so, unless the approach of the American Troops Shall afford them hopes of Protection, in which case I am inclined to think he will be disappointed as the people cannot but feel resentment at the sudden transition from assumed lenity to a demand of bearing Arms in manifestation of their loyalty, or being exposed to confiscation of Property and punishmt. for supposed Crimes. We hear our assembly are about to reconsider their late determination respecting the Scheme of Finance recommended by Congress, and that it was expected the Measure would yet be adopted.(2) I am happy to hear it, being confident the rejection of the proposition and the emission of more paper money could not fail of producing the worst of consequences. Let us not depart from the determination not to increase the quantity-that resolution has already appreciated the money and a steady adherance to the measure will at length effectually do it. The present is the Season for accomplishing the great work of Confederation. If we suffer it to pass away I fear it will never return. The example of New York is worthy of imitation-could Virginia but think herself as she certainly is already full large for vigorous Government, she too would moderate her desires, and cede to the united States, upon certain conditions, her Territory beyond the Ohio. The act of New York, the instructions of Maryland to their Delegates, and the Declaration of that State upon the subject And the late remonstrance of Virga. are now before a Committee, and I expect they will report, that it be recommended to the States having extensive western unappropriated Claims to follow the example of New York and by Law Authorise their Delegates to make the Cession.(3) I some time past sent Mr. Mason a Copy of the New York Act. Gloomy as the prospect of our affairs has been and in fact still is when compared with the Objects we have in view through the Course of this Campaign I yet feele myself revived by the accounts lately received from our State that the people are at length awakened from their slumber and appear to act with becoming Spirit and ardor at this important conjuncture, especially as the States in general, for the present moment, seem to be roused and impressed with the necessity of great & immediate exertions and if the Spirit is kept up for a while we may reasonably hope for the happiest Consequences. I have been much and still am depressed to think that America should do so little for herself while France is proposing to do so much- that we should, contending for every thing dear and valuable to men, look on with folded Arms and suffer other Powers almost unassisted by us, to work out our salvation and Independence. The Idea is humiliating. The Fact must [be] dishonorable and our Posterity will blush to read It in future Story. Letters from Martinique so late as   the 3d & 4th of this month inform us of the arrival of a Spanish Frigate announcing that 12 Spanish Ships of the line, 4-50 Gunship[s] and six Frigates with abt. 10,000 Troops were abt. 200 leagues to windwd. when the Frigate left them, coming forward to join the French Fleet and forces. The Ct. Guichen was going out with 16 sail of the line to meet them. Upon the junction of their Fleets, the superiority of the Combined Force will be decided, and we may expect soon to hear of some important stroke made in that Quarter. It was conjectured their first attempt wod. be St. Lucia if the approach of the hurricane months did not discourage the enterprise- then Jamacia and from thence come round and by uniting the whole Forces sweep the Coast of North America. The representation is grand and opens so pleasing a prospect to us I will not lessen your pleasure by a doubt of it being verified. These Letters further inform us that the Armament carrying on at Brest and wch. they expected was for the Wt. Indies is for North America and that it was expected to sail abt. the 15th April. It is said to consist of ten ships of the line and a large Body of Troops-no doubt they will make it as large as they well can as it is evident the War will be principally here and in the Wt. Indies. Between the 12th & l9th of last month Rodney and Guichen have had three engagements, the last a severe action in wch. the Count kept the Sea. For further particulars I refer you to the inclosed paper as well as for the account so far as we are yet informed of the action at Springfield in the Jerseys between our Troops & Militia under Genl.

  Gentlemen. Philadelphia lst July 1780.  When I addressed you under the 24th February last,(1) I had received the strongest assurances from Capt. Hill, Master of the Ad- JULY 1, 1780  riana that, Wind permiting, he would Sail the very next day, I had constantly visited his Vessel Morning, Noon & Evening urging dispatch; my Sea Stock &c were already embarked & I had for several preceeding days held myself in readiness to follow them at a moments warning, but that next day & another passed away without effect, when there appeared at Anchor in front of Charles Town Harbor about thirteen Sail of the Enemy's Ships of War & rendred it impracticable for a Vessel of the Adriana's draught of Water to go to Sea with safety.  In these circumstances I determined to seek a Passage in one of the Northern Ports, & at George Town hired a small Schooner, the Peggy, Gabriel Bryan, Master, to convey me, at my option, to Martinique, Wilmington or some Port in Chesepeke Bay & I ordered the Indigo which had been shipped in the Adriana to be put on board the Peggy, upon terms of freight much more advantageous to the Public than those which had been agreed upon with the Owners of the former Vessel-at George Town I ordered the Peggy to Wilmington where I was informed there was an exceeding good Vessel bound to France. Upon my arrival at Wilmington I found that Vessel was in no forwardness, therefore I pressed Capt. Bryan to the further prosecution of his engagement by sailing to York in Virginia, where I learned the fier Roderique an Armed french Ship was lying & nearly ready to Sail for Port L'Orient, as I wished to embark in the Roderique or some other Vessel bound directly to Europe in order to save Money & time which must unavoidably have been expended had I attempted a circuitos Voyage through the West Indies, as well as to avail myself of the best Market for Sale of the Indigo & to shun a double risque of Capture; the Captain endeavored to excuse himself from a compliance by alledging that his Mariners had refused to go the Voyage & that many of them had absconded upon being informed of the destination; he had also been instructed by his Owner Mr. Nelson to reland the Indigo if I should insist upon the Vessel's going to Virginia & to protest the impossibility of procuring Seamen. After wasting much time in attempts to persuade Capt. Bryan to proceed to York in pursuance of his contract, I received intelligence of the fall of Fort Moultrie & Charles Town in which I foresaw the whole state of South Carolina would be involved, & it being the general opinion that the Port of Wilmington would soon be invested by the Enemy's Cruisers, I proposed as an alternative, that the Peggy should proceed directly to Cadiz, the freight of the Indigo to be no more than was to have been paid had she discharged at Martinique or in Chesepeake Bay, which was accepted-the Schooner departed from Wilmington the 25th May & I believe went safely to Sea on the 26th.  Inclosed with this, you will receive an Invoice & Bill of Loading for the Indigo,(2) when I get possession of my Papers which are in a Waggon on their way hither I will present you with Copy of my  JULY 4, 1780  Instructions to the Merchants at Cadiz to whom the Indigo is consigned, will explain the intent & meaning of the reserve \""subject to the further order of the said Henry Laurens.\"" contained in those documents & also inform you in what manner the Rice inserted in the first Invoice was disposed of, the Plate mentioned in the said first Invoice is coming forward with my Papers.  South Carolina being in possession of the Enemy, & nothing, in my view, at the time of the Peggy's Sailing, that could have prevented a rapid & destructive progress of the Enemy through No. Carolina wrought so great a change on the face of our public affairs & such a reverse of my own fortune, as led me to think it proper & even incumbent on me to present myself to Congress. I arrived in this City last Night & now wait their further Commands.  Before I conclude, permit me Gentlemen to observe & to assure you that a constant & steady attention to my Public Duty has been extremely detrimental to my private Interest-by a personal application to the latter I might have saved as many articles in moveables from my Estates as would have yielded me many Thousand Pounds Sterling, these have been since taken or destroyed by the British Troops or are now in their possession & I am at this moment reduced to such circumstances as would be grievos to a Man who had not sincerely devoted his Life & fortune to the service of his Country.

  My dear Sir, Philada. July 4th. 1780.  Your favor of the 31st of May came to hand the 29th of June, the reasons why I was so long deprived of the pleasure of receiving it I am not able to say.  My being appointed to a Seat in the honble house & soon after in Council are very distinguishing marks of confidence & respect,(1) but what adds to it is the obliging manner in which you communicated the same.  The reasons you are pleased to assign for not writing more particular, I wish you to consider as opparating the same on my side, as I hope to have the pleasure of paying you my personal respects in about five weeks.  The reasons of our present embarrassed State of affairs is owing in a great measure to these two great causes the depreciation of our currency, & some of the states not immediately coming in to the resolutions of Congress of the 18th of March last respecting finance. I was happy to hear the State [I] have the honor to represent, immediately complied with them; I perceive the states are coming in one after another (better late than never) they begin to be sensible that they are now suffering for not complying sooner. I thought when they passd. & have seen no reason to alter my opinion that over all under God in a great measure, depended thereon.  Please to make my proper respects to Mrs. Hutchinson.

  My worthy friends Philada. July 4th. 1780. A few days since I was favored with a letter from Colo. Hutchinson, in which he mentions that the Town of Danvers had made choice of me with himself to represent them in the Genl. Assembly the ensuing year; I take the earliest oppertunity to acknowledge the honor done me and to assure you that such repeated marks of your confidance & respect will have a deep and lasting impression upon my mind; & whatever station I may be called to act in, it will always give me  JULY 4, 1780  satisfaction to think that while I am endeavouring to Serve my country in general that I still retain the approbation of the Town that gave me birth & first bro't me into public view, & which in times past I had the pleasure of Serving more immediately; But I must observe, that previous to my receiving the Colonels letter I had been formally notified by the Honble. Council of Massachusetts that the Genl. Court had elected me one of the Council and desired me to take my seat accordingly, I returned for answer that as soon as my engagements here wou'd permit & I cou'd with propriety leave Congress, I wou'd return & take my seat at the honorable board,(1) which deprives me of accepting a seat in the honble house to which you was pleased to appoint me; However, I consider it not very material which house I am in, for you may be assured that all matters that particularly respect the Town of Danvers shall be noticed by me. Permit me to congratulate you on the anniversary of our independance this day; and 'tho' our cruel enemies still continue their endeavours to Subjugate us, yet I have good reason to hope the time is not far distant when they must give up their unjust pretensions and that we shall then enjoy the blessing of Liberty & peace and hand down to posterity the rights of men inviolate which will be a full reward for our labour & care.  I am, Gentlemen, with sincere respect, your most obliged humble servant.  ""

  Dear John, Philadelphia 6th July 1780  Having just heard of an opportunity to write to you by the way of France I relieve the fatigue of an uninteresting debate in which our Friends Fell & Holton take the lead(1) to let you hear from me. If I have not been unfortunate you must at your arrival have found several Letters from me,(2) some of them written in our first cypher which you tell me has become useless so that they are probably unintelligible to you.(3)  I shall now confine myself to general subjects as my present cypher JULY 6, 1780  is not at hand. I have been here since the 4th of Novr. very much against my inclinations & know not how much longer I may be detained. Mr. D is gone home,(4) & as he has views upon your old seat he will hurry back to be in time & he assures me that I shall have leave to go immediately upon his return, & as I do not look the same way I think I shall indulge him. You have I dare say heard of poor Morris misfortune in the loss of his leg. He bears it with magnanimity & is in a fair way of recovery. I feel for him & yet am led to hope that it may turn out to his advantage & tend to fix his desultory genious to a point in which case it can not fail to go far.  As I know the interest you take in what may contribute to my happiness, I venture to inform you of a domestick occurrence by which it is greatly increased, the birth of a daughter. I saw your son (5) at headquarters about two months ago. He is a fine healthy boy and the Idol of his grandmother. Now I am speaking of her, I must tell you that she was so imprudent as to remove with her family to Elizabeth town, where she was vissited by the enemies whole army, who treated her with civility as I learn by a letter to Mrs Morris from Caty. But their troops being very hardly treated by the New Jersey Militia on a second vissit they made to Springfield, which they burnt, they called a second time at the Govrs., & were with great difficulty prevented from burning the house by Mrs. Liv., Mr. Livingston not being at home. You are happy in being far from this scene of trouble. The enemy by the reduction of Charlestown have obliged us to make large detachments from the main army and by returning with the greater part of their force have kept us in continual motion, tho fortunately they are now again by the aid of the militia shut up in New York. And we are waiting in anxious expectation the arrival of the French armament in order to attempt some thing important. In the mean while we shall need great assistance from the court at which you now are to enable us to make some arrangement of our finances, from the disorder of which our greatest evils flow. These however are by no means remediless; they want much attention, & some support from our allies to put them upon the best & most stable footing. I forgot to mention that I have recd. within this few days your Letter from Cadiz.(6) I was mortified to such a degree at not hearing from you while at Martinique that I could not bring myself to continue writing as I had done till your Last convinc'd me that I was not forgotten. I have seen Mrs. Jays journal, (7) feel her distress, admire her fortitude & offer her my congratulations upon her present agreeable situation. You will offer my compliments to the Coll. & Mr. Carmichael, & receive my best wishes for your happiness. I am Dear John with the sincerest esteem, Your friend & hum. servt.  Robt R.

  Head Quarters near Pasaick falls Sir July 6, 1780  The Commander in chief has suggested the propriety of Investing the Committee here with power to Call any of the Continental ships of war which may be In the Adjacent seas to such points as the exigency of the Service may require; That their aid will be necessary In the prosecution of the Intended operation is beyond a doubt and the delay which must of course take place from a previous application to the Admiralty to direct them to a Compliance with the wishes of the General may prove so detrimental that I conceive It ought not to be risqued.  As the Subsistance money to the Officers of the line for the retained rations has not been paid for some time past, they are reduced to great distress, and have become exceedingly uneasy. Remonstrances have been on foot and would Already have been transmitted to Congress, had not the prudent Intervention of the General prevented the Increase for the present, I apprehend the Committee will be under the necessity of directing the Commissaries to furnish them In Actual Service with all the rations they are Intitled to, until the pleasure of Congress is known.

  Dear Sir, Philada. 8th July 1780 For these few days past this place afords but little News. The Enemy remain at Philips's House on the N. Side of Hudsons River, but have yet made no attempt toward Westpoint. A private letter from Baltimore brings intelligence that a French as well as a Spanish Fleet (of the latter we heard some time ago) is arrived at Martinique, but for what purposes, or exactly of what Size we have not yet learned.  The Enemy in South Carolina according to our last advices possessed three different Posts whereby they command the principal part of the provisions of that State, One at Camdon, One on the Congaree, and a third pointing toward the disaffected highlanders in North Carolina. Each of those Posts are upward of One hundred miles West of Charlestown. Fourteen hundred of the disaffected in the back parts of South Carolina are Said to have joined the british & their numbers daily growing. On the Other hand Genl. Caswell from North Carolina had Set out with fourteen hundred Militia to be followed by Others in Order to prevent a junction of the Enemy with the highlanders at Cross-Creek. Baron DeCalb, as I understand it, is forming a Circuituous March North West of the Enemy in Order to get betwixt them & Charlote in South Carolina, a place where we  JULY 8, 1780  have Some military Stores. General Gates appears to have a Sufficient Spot of Work cut out for him, Yet the Enemy cannot exceed four thousand, except what increase they may have through the disaffected of these States which it's feared will be many & occasion what more Strictly may be called a Civil War. The Governors of South Carolina & Georgia are both here which is very wrong, but Governor Rutledge will Suddenly return.(1) In a New Plan for the Qr. Masters Department now before Congress It is proposed that only One Assistant Qr. M. Gl., will be allow'd-and he to reside near Congress. One Deputy Qr. Master in each State to procure Carriages &c. he is to be named by the Qr. Master Genl. but must be approved by the Supreme Council of each State & the Board of War-he will have Clerks or assistants, but without Forage or rations. No Forage Master farther to be allowed but with the Army.(2) The pay of this State Qr. Master is not yet fixed. In Pennsylvania he will have much Work. Who will Genl. Greene pitch on for this State? It is not yet known whether he will Serve but as the System is only designed for the Campaign, it's thought he will. His pay is to be about 15 hundred a year or at the rate thereof in hard money including his pay as Major General.  Mrs. Armstrong has wrote me for £150 & I cannot Send her One pound but have refered her to you & said I wou'd write you. I hope you will be able to Oblige her with that Sum or what She may Stand in need of. You have wrote nothing of the Rum whether you got it or not. Does the Old black mare Stumble dangerously when She rides Slow, or does She not? I send you the last News paper in my possession which is better than that of this day.  Four thousand hard has been refused for our Works-the Company Asked Six. If you See Josey Thornbrogh please to tell him that in my Opinion five thousand is the mark.

  My Dr. Sir Philada. July 8th 1780 I shall make no apology for this address farther than assuring you that personal respect is my principal inducement. JULY 8, 1780  The depreciation of our currency has greatly embarrassed the public affairs, but I think the resolutions of Congress of the 18th of March last respecting finance, (which I suppose you have seen) has produced a crisis; and I think with proper care the credit of the new bills will be kept up.  The fall of Charlestown at first seemed to give a considerable shock, but it has had this happy effect, the good people appear to be all arrived & are making much greater exertions than I have reason to think they would have done (this campaign) had Charles town remained in our hands.  Gen. Clinton has returned to N. York, it is said with 6000 troops, they have lately been out in the state of N. Jersey in force & burnt Springfield, but the militia turned out with uncommon bravery, and opposed them with great spirit, together with part of the Continental troops under the command of G. Green who recd. them so warmly they tho't proper to retreat; It has been tho't lately by their movements that they intended to attack West point, but the country are so much alarmed & G.W. is moving towards the north river, I expect they will return to N.Y. after burning distroying & collecting forrage in their usual manner.  We are looking out every day for our fleet & army from our ally to assist us, God grant they may come safe.  By the last accounts from Boston, I understand our new proposed constitution has been approved of by more than two thirds of the voters at the several Town meetings & is to take place in Octr. next.(1)  Affairs are going on agreeably in Congress excepting our common embarrassments .

He will be better able to inform you of the State of things here, than I can, who after twelve Months Absense from this City, returned but a few days ago. The People of Massachusetts have at length agreed to the Form of a civil Constitution (2) in Nothing varying from a Copy which I sent to you by a Son of our Friend General Warren.(3) This great Business was carried through with much good Humour among the People and even in Berkshire, where some Persons led us to expect it would meet with many obstructions. Never was a good Constitution more wanted than at this Juncture. Among other more lasting Advantages, I hope that in Connsequence of it, the Part which that State must take in the War, will be conducted with greater Attention and better Effect. Who is to be the first Man, will be determind in September, when, if our Newspapers rightly inform us, the new Government is to take Place. The Burden will fall on the Shoulders of one of two Gentlemen whom you know.(4) May Heaven lead the People to the wisest Choice. The first chosen governor may probably have it in his Power to do more good or more Hurt than any of his Successors. The french Fleet is not yet arrivd.

Mr Smith himself with Mrs. Smith & one Daughter & Mr. Roger Smiths family were at his Plantation about 18 Miles from Town during the Seige. The Enemy were frequently at his House but he has not suffered any loss by them except that of one or two of his Negroes who Joined them-his four Sons were all in the Town, but his Son Peter was so III, as to be obliged to leave it some time before the surrender, & went to his family at Mr. Middletons, whose Daughter he married, & who had removed about 120 Miles into the Country, we have since heard he is better. The others escaped without hurt in the Town, and are now prisoners on Parole. Mrs. Bee & one of her Sisters with our two little ones, are with me in Philadelphia. Our last Accounts from the family are that they were all well in health, though much dejected in Spirits on Account of the situation of Affairs in our Country, however hitherto their property is safe, except the Houses in Town which are all occupied in part by the British. This is in general the best account I can render you of the situation of the family, which I am happy in communicating, as you so feelingly simpathise with their Distress.

  In Committee of Congress Sir, Preakness, New Jersey, July 10. 1780 The Commander in Chief, having laid before this Committee, let JULY 10, 1780  letters from the quarter master general, and Commissary General of forage, stating the necessity of immediately forming a magazine of short forage, in the vicinity of Hudsons river; It will readily occur to your excellency, that without this article, the necessary transportation, to convey the variety of stores incident on a large operating Army, cannot be maintained. They have therefore to intreat your earliest attention to expedite the orders for forwarding, the quantity requried of your state, by the Committee.(1) This state, by supplying the Army during the winter, and to the present hour, is intirely exhausted. The failure of crops last year, in the state of New York, and the drafts made from it, for the support of the Cattle of West Point, have rendered that state incapable of furnishing any for the present, so that our main reliance, at least until some time after the present crop is gathered, must be on the states south of Delaware.

  In Committee of Congress, state of New Jersey Sir Preakness, July 10th 1780 The commander in chief having laid before this Committee letters from the quarter-master general, and commissary general of forage, respecting tents and forage which appeard to be matters of such vast Consequences as induced us to address the States, South of Delaware to Virginia inclusive on the subject of the Latter, and the associated Merchants of Philadelphia, on the former.(1) The scarcity of Flour in the States North of Delaware; The little probability of any effectual supply from those States, for a very considerable time beyond harvest, as many of the inhabitants will be taken off, by Militia duty, either with the Army or to protect the frontiers, or be employed in the necessary transportation, excites a wish that the associated Merchants should lay out and forward the whole amount of their funds in that article. But the danger and distress which the Army will be exposed to, for want of tents should it operate in a part of the Country where there are no materials for JULY 10, 1780  a substitute, is so evident that it admits of no alternative, and obliges us to call on them for a supply; we have however only requested one thousand, in hopes that some may be procured from the Navy board at Boston. It is probable the commander in chief will address the Eastern Merchants to afford their aid, on the occasion, and to extend it to the article of sand bags, and knapsacks, the former of which, in a serious operation seem almost indispensible, especially if the Army should operate in a part of the Country, so destitute of wood that gabions and fascines cannot be procured, without great expense and labour. Perhaps, Sir, it might not be improper for Congress to give assurances that if any associations should take place to the Eastward to furnish the Articles we have mentioned, or any others necessary for the service, the associators should in point of security for their disbursements be put on the same footing with those in Pensylvania. Should the house be in sentiment with us on this subject, a speedy communication of their determination may tend to expedite the business.  The uncertain footing on which the officers in the quarter master generals department now stand will occasion many to resign, unless their stipends are ascertained. It is therefore much to be wished that an immediate determination of Congress on the arrangement of that department, should be conveyed to the General or the committee. We do not allude merely to a system for conducting it; for how can one be adopted that will apply to contingencies remote, and which no human penetration can foresee or guard against? To direct the movements of supplies to be drawn from such a variety of sources, and by the different channels which the very nature of state supplies renders unavoidable and through the agencies of state officers, unaccountable to the Military, or to one conducting body, will be a task infinitely arduous, and we fear it will not be effectually done, even with the best exertions of the public officers, without the frequent intervention of Congress by some of its members repairing, as occasion may require, to this or that state, to give countenance, aid, & advice to the agents.  Should the quantity of Flour and short forage accumulated on the banks of the Delaware exceed the means of transportation by land would it not be advisable to take measures for speedily collecting a number of Vessels to convey it to the bay of New York, should the French fleet gain that point, and the passage from Delaware thither be rendered safe by any Ships of War which might be appointed to convoy the provision transport?  We have the honor to be, With great respect and esteem, Your Excellencys Most obedient humble. Sevt, P. Schuyler  N. Peabody (2) P.S.

The scarcity of flour in the states North of the Delaware-the little probability that they will be in a condition to furnish any until some considerable time beyond harvest, induces a wish that the whole amount of the fund you have, with such partriotic generosity created for the relief of your Country at this critical juncture, should be expended in the purchase and transportation of that article, but the exceeding distress the Army would experience for a want of Tents, and the little probability of procuring an adequate supply in any other quarter, obliges the Committee to intreat you to appropriate part of the fund in the purchase of one thousand soldiers Tents.

  July 10th, 1780.  The Committee to whom were referred the Letter from General JULY 10, 1780  Washington of 31st March last, and the Proceedings of the Commissioners who met at Amboy in the Same Month to treat of the Settlement of a Cartel for the Exchange of Prisoners of War, beg Leave to state to Congress the following Information and remarks.(1)  That the Troops of the Convention of Saratoga have been since the Time of their Capture, and still continue to be furnished with rations of Provisions and Fuel at the Expense of the United States.  That no Payment has been made on the Part of the British Government for the said Provisions and Fuel, since the Departure of General Burgoyne; and though formal Application has been made for a Settlement and Discharge of the Accounts, or an Acknowledgement of the Debt and a proper Assurance of Payment, both have been first evaded and then refused.  That your Comittee, from certain Circumstances in the Conduct and Declarations of the Enemy, are of Opinion the British Government mean to dispute the Justice of allowing those Accounts, especially of such as have accrued since the General comanding their Troops in America officially declared to Congress his Authority to ratify, on the Part of the British King, the Convention of Saratoga.  That should this be the Case the Decision of the Matter will, in all Probability, be submitted to a mediating or arbitrating Power; and if Principles of Policy rather than Right should sway, the Interest of the United States, in this respect, may be sacrificed to Considerations of Convenience.  That the Support of the said Troops is productive of very heavy Expenses, and in the Opinion of your Committee, considering the Uncertainty of Retribution, more hurtful to the Comunity than their Service in the Field, if exchanged, would probably be.  That it might be attended with unfavourable Consequences to suffer the Enemy to have a free Intercourse by Flags of Truce to supply the said Troops with necessaries.  That great Numbers of the said Troops escape from Time to Time, many of whom make their way to the Enemy in New-York and elsewhere so that not more than Half the original Number now remain; and the United States lose the Benefit of their Exchange.  That a principal Difficulty which prevents the Settlement of a Cartel for the Exchange of Prisoners, is the Pride and Obstinacy of the British Government which prevents them from empowering their General to pledge any Thing further than his personal Honour for the Performance of such Stipulations as may be agreed on by Commissioners on both Sides; but as Exchanges have from Time to Time been made pro tanto, without the Establishment of a regular Cartel, and in present Circumstances, no other Mode can be expected soon to take Place.  The Committee submit the following Resolution.  That General Washington be fully empowered to negociate an   Exchange of the Troops of the Convention of Saratoga, at such Time, in such Manner and on such Terms as he may think proper.  That in any Negociation upon this Subject it be an Instruction to obtain Payment as far as possible, of the monies due for Provisions and Fuel furnished to the said Troops on Account of the United States; and, if the same cannot be fully obtained, to procure, if possible, an Assurance that all Differences upon that Subject will hereafter be submitted to proper Discussion and Settlement, that an impartial Decision thereof may be had.  Provided always, That Nothing respecting the said Accounts be made an Ultimatum in any Treaty of Exchange.  ""

  Sir, Philada. 10July 1780. The principal military Event which has happened this Spring, indeed since you left us, is the Fall of Charleston, the Capital of South Carolina. No Circumstance very material can be added to the Account officially published, and which you have had from the Papers transmitted already and repeated by this Conveyance. It will, I hope be excused in us, that you will probably see this in the European Papers before it reaches you from this City: our Intelligence being over-land, is tedious in it's Passage; add to this that the Enemy after the Capitulation, interposed every Means by dilatory and frivolous Pretences, by what Candour will probably decide to be a Breach of the Spirit of their Engagements, to delay the Dispatches General Lincoln had stipulated should be forwarded immediately to Con JULY 10, 1780  gress. This you will readily believe when you compare the Date of the Surrender of the Town with that of the Arrival of Lieut Colonel Ternant at Philadelphia, and are advised withal that he met with no Obstruction on the Way. General Lincoln with his Family has since arrived.(1)  We have daily Accounts from the Southward that the Enemy pay no regard to the Stipulations pledged in Favour of the Citizens. Rapines, Violences, Devastations and Abuses of every Kind are comitted without reserve. You recollect their Conduct in New Jersey in the year 1776 and 7; it is similar in this Case, though they are under Terms. The Issue too may be like; they have overrun a considerable Part of the State in the Hour of its Nakedness and Debility, but as General Gates is assembling a Force against them, and their Measures seem as usual to be dictated by Infatuation, Impolicy and Ignorance, when they have wrought up the the Spirits of the People to Fury and Desperation they will be expelled from the Country.  It seems to be the Ordination of Providence, and, though the Sufferings are severe, the Interest of the States, that each should have a Share of this Kind of Calamity. It is clear and undisputed Experience that in those States where for a Time they have made Progress, and from whence they have been driven with Arms, or retired with Disappointment and Disgrace, the Flame of Liberty and Patriotism burns with double Strength and Brightness, and the Exertions of the People are greater and more deciding. The Militia of New Jersey and New-York, whose Vengeance against Great Britian Ages will not be able to eradicate, have in several late Instances fought them with the most desperate internecine Furry. We have Not heard of such a Thing to the Southward as yet, but may in due Time.  Every Person who has attended to the Course of our Revolution will know the Meaning of what seems a Paradox, 'that our Misfortunes are our Safety.' They are certainly, under GOD, the Source of it. Our Captive Soldiers will as usual be prisoned, starved and insulted, will be scourged into the Service of the Enemy; the Citizens will suffer Pillagings, Violences and Conflagrations; a fruitful Country will be desolated; but the Loss of Charleston will to all Appearance promote the general Cause. It has awaked a Spirit unknown since the Year 1776; a Spirit which is fast pervading the Mass of the Community; a Spirit which enlivens and encreases daily. I am more afraid of an unfavourable Effect of this Disaster on your Side of the Water, and hope you will take the proper Means for preventing any ill Impressions it might otherwise have.  The Enemy have brought back more than Half their [troops] from the Southward. Cornwallis commands with between four and five Thousand Men. At this Date they are at Kingsbridge and some miles above.  Governour Livingston and Family were well four Days ago.  I am, Sir your obedt hble Servant, Willm Ch Houston   ""

  Sir, Philadelphia, July 10, 1780.  I know not how I can profess all the regard which I feel for you, without appearing on the one hand, to do it upon slight grounds, or on the other, to have delayed it too long.  I have been steadily in Congress without once visiting my dear family in Boston, since January 1777, and from May, that year, have been a member of the committee of foreign affairs; consequently I am well informed of your truly republican spirit, your particular affection for these states, and your industry in their service, most of your numerous letters down to December the 30th, 1779, having come to hand.  The honourable gentleman who will deliver this, being also a member of Congress, has a just esteem for you, and promises himself much advantage from an opportunity of conversing with you. Mr. JULY 10, 1780  Searle is well able to make a due return of the benefit from the fund of his intimacy with American state affairs, his extensive commercial knowledge and his science of mankind gained by former travails. I shall shortly write to you again, by another respectable gentleman of our assembly,' and I will use every means to make him the bearer of what you have so rightfully solicited, as a faithful first correspondent of our committee, from whom you will probably have regular official letters, under a new arrangement of a secretaryship,(2) which has been vacant from the days of a confusion excited by an indiscreet and illiberal publication, here on the 5th of December 1778, and which you have read with grief.(3)  In the meantime I hope you will receive kindly this individual testimony of cordial friendship, for sir, your very humble servant.  James Lovell MS not found; reprinted from The Port Folio, 4 (January 28, 1804): 29-30.  1 That is, Henry Laurens.  2 Lovell may have been referring to plans for a department of foreign affairs, which had been referred to a committee appointed on May 15 whose recommendations were submitted on June 12. Congress, however, did not consider the committee's report until December 15, and only on January 10, 1781, was a department of foreign affairs established. See JCC, 17:428, 505, 18:1156, 19:42-44.  3 Lovell was referring to Thomas Paine's dismissal from the post of secretary to the Committee for Foreign Affairs.

  Sir, Philada. 11 July 1780 The principal military Event which has taken Place for some considerable Time past, is the Fall of Charlestown, the Capital of South Carolina. No very material Circumstances can, as yet, be added to those officially published, and which the several American Prints have given you, and the British still earlier. The Intelligence from the Southward being overland is very tedious in it's Passage; and besides this, after the Capitulation the Enemy interposed every Means by dilatory and frivolous Pretences, by what Candour will, in my Opinion, decide to be a Breach of the Spirit of their Engagements, to delay the Dispatches General Lincoln had stipulated should be sent to Congress. (1) This is in their usual Stile, and we have daily Accounts of Cases in which they pay no Sort of regard to their Promises sacredly pledged in Favour of the Citizens. Rapines, Violences and Abuses of every Kind are committed without Reserve, and with very little discrimination. Their Conduct is of a Piece with what they have held in every similar Instances, uninfluenced by any Principles of Honour, Truth, Humanity or even Policy. In the Hour of Debility and Want of Preparation to oppose them, they have overun a considerable Part of the State of South Carolina; but as General Gates is collecting a Force to oppose them, and as their Cruelties and Oppressions will probably soon work up the Spirits of the People to Fury and Desperation, they will be expelled from the Country.  It seems to be the Ordination of Providence, and, though the Sufferings are severe, it seems to be the Interest of the Union, that JULY 11, 1780  each State, in it's Turn should be vexed with their Depredations and Barbarities. It operates an amazing Change in the Temper and Sentiments of the People, and fixed them in a rooted and resolute Determination to risque the Extreme of Destruction in Preference before Submission. It is clear and undisputed Experience, that in those States where they have made Progress, and from which they have been driven with Arms, or obliged to relinquish with Shame and Disappointment, the Flame of Liberty and Patriotism burns with more Strength and Brightness, and the Exertions of the People are most deciding and irresistible.  Every Person who has attended to the Course of our Revolution knows the Meaning of what in Words is a Paradox, that our misfortunes are our Safety. The Capture of Charlestown is much to be regretted when we reflect that our Soldiers will be starved and scourged into the Enemy's Service; that the Citizens must suffer Pillagings, Conflagrations and Brutality, but it is obvious to every one that it will promote, under the Favour of Heaven, the general Cause. It has awaked a Spirit superiour to any Thing I have seen since the year 1775 and 6, a Spirit that is fast pervading the whole Comunity, A Spirit which enlivens and increases every Day.  Cornwallis commands to the Southward with between four and five thousand men; Clinton has brought back to New-York a Number somewhat larger, and at the Date of this they are encamped from Philipse's on the North-river across the Country above King's-bridge. When the News of the Fall of Charlestown arrived, and the Troops were returning from thence, they came out with much Confidence and Triumph into New-Jersey, setting Fire to the Country as they passed. The disaffected strengthened their Expectations of Despondence and Submission among the Militia, and Dissertions from the regular Troops. In every Respect they were more disappointed, than perhaps they have ever been since the Commencement of the war. Scarce a man deserted, or Citizen adhered to them, both regulars and Militia, particularly the latter, fought them with the most desperate internecine Fury. The Vengeance due to their former Baseness and Barbarities cannot be forgotten.

  Dear Sir July 11. 1780  By a Letter from Messrs. Gardoqui & Sons of May 3d recd. yesterday I have the Pleasure of knowing you were then well. In a Postscript to one of his former of Feb. 24, the P S not dated, he says he hears of you every Week. (1) This creates a Chagrin as we have none of your Favors later than March 3d (2) You are not to suppose, however, that I dare to complain. I have read my Bible to better Purpose. I am not entitled to throw the \""first stones\"". But I have as good a title as anybody to paliate my own faults, and to shift them upon others. There is said to be a Comtee. of forgn. Affairs, each member is loaded with a variety of business, two have amiable Wives near Pensylvania.(3) I miss the Gentlemen therefore frequently. Mr. Livingston is now absent but you have herewith a Letter he sent to my Care a few days ago.(4) The weather is murderous hot and I cannot go up and down to the Offices in search of those authenticated Papers which ought to be regularly forwarded to you and other dignified Officers abroad. You will be pleased therefore to know from me individually and by Way of a Resolve of Congress of June 21 st certified by me that Mr. Dohrman of Lisbon is appointed an Agent in Portugal. The chief View at this time was that the lives of our poor sailors might not be lost in captivity in that Kingdom. Mr. Dohrman has done an infinitude of kind acts already to such as have been carried into Ports near Lisbon. He is a Gentleman of much Influence through his personal Character his Riches & Relations. I have no doubt you will find Advantage from frequent Correspondence with him. He is not yet furnished with any authentic Account of his ap- JULY 11, 1780  pointment. He ought to have some Commission, perhaps beyond a certified Resolve, and he should have some regular instructions. I will endeavor to get Mr. Houston to join me in a Letter to the Gentleman to cover the Proof of his having been elected on the 21st of June.(5) It was represented by Mr. Anderson of Virginia who is his Agent, that Mr. Dohrman expected no other recompence than the repayment of his Advances, in the usual Way, and those Emoluments that will be naturally consequential upon his being known the public Agent of these States in Portugal. The Proofs of his Spirit in our Cause are unequivocal and his liberality to our suffering countrymen has abundant Proofs. I did give Mr. Anderson a Copy of the Resolve for his own satisfaction but I told him it would go with Authority through You and that Mr. Dohrman ought not to be deprived of the sole Judgement of making the Appointment more or less a Thing of Notoriety according to the Politicks of the Kingdom of Portugal. Mr. Searle is the Bearer of this Via France and Mr. Laurens will either go for Holland in the same Ship, the Jay, or will sail in a few days by another opportunity for Holland. The former Gentleman is on business for the State of Pensylva. and perhaps for some mercantile Companies also. You already know Mr. Laurens is to negotiate a Loan. Indeed an Instruction was given to a Comtee. to bring in a Draught of a Letter to the ministers plenipotentiary of these States at Versailles and Madrid directing them to inform his most christian & Catholic Majesty of the Appointment of Mr. Laurens and to solicit the Aid of their majesties respectively on this Occasion.(6)  I am, Sir, your Friend and very humble Servant, James Lovell ""

  Dear Sir Philada.July 11th 1780.  Your favor by the new line of Expresses I rec'd,(1) & should have answer'd it thro' the same channel, but the bearer was gone before it came to my hand.  I rejoice to hear of the late proceedings of our Assembly with JULY 11, 1780  respect to the new Scheme of Finance,(2) the Pennsylva. Line &c; these I think are objects of vast Consequence. I wish the business of our back Lands was setled, that the Confederation might be compleated. Do you not think it would be advisable in Virginia to give up her exclusive Claims beyond the Ohio, to be guaranteed in all her Teritory on this side? From the present face of affairs here, I am doubtful whether these are not as good Terms as the Confederation could now be compleated on. The United States making us a Compensation for our extraordinary Expence incurr'd in the defence of that Country. I wished to have consulted you on this business before I came here, but had not the pleasure of seeing you. There is now a Committee of Congress deliberating on this Business & I suppose some steps will shortly be taken in it, but expect they will be merely recommendatory.(3) In the mean time should be glad to know your Sentiments on the Subject.  With regard to the late vote, by which I was left out of the next year's Delegation, my Interest could not have been more effectually promoted, tho' certainly it had not the suaviter in modo. I now consider myself as fully absolved for the remainder of my life, from all Civil Employments, having been rejected both by my County & Country; possess'd however of the Mens conscia recti and the Friendship of such as you, I envie no Man his Lot.  I am glad you kept the map sent me by my Father, it was intended chiefly for the use of your honble. Board.(4) Part of his Letter too related to the Commonwealth of Virginia. If you did not read it pray inform me, that I may send you such Extracts from it as may deserve your Attention.  Perhaps you or Mrs. Jefferson may have some little Commissions here, if so I claim them as my right. Almost any thing may be had here for money enough, a little will get nothing. Goods are generally about 50 Per Ct. above what they used to be in hard money & if paid in paper 60 for one on that. I rejoice to tell you, that in the Eastern States, where the New bills begin to circulate, there is no kind of difference between them & Silver. A Strong argument in fav. of the Resolution of the 18th of March.  Inclosed you have the last paper to which I beg leave to refer you for News.

  Dear General: Philad'a, July 11th, 1780.  Your favour of the 4th instant inclosing the Virginia Gazette I received with great pleasure, and rejoice to find that you so cheerfully lay aside every consideration of domestic tranquillity &c. when your country so loudly calls for your services. May they be crowned with that success they so justly deserve.  The French fleet, we are informed by the Baltimore papers, has arrived at Martozines [Martinique]. I think that by forming ajunction with the other French and Spanish forces in that quarter our relentless foes may be more suddenly and vitally wounded than on the continent. Their united fleets in the West Indies will not be far short of fifty sail of the line with about 30,000 troops. With such a force as this, what is to prevent their immediately possessing themselves of all the British isles in those seas? This being done, the continental business will not be difficult. On the other hand, should they come immediately here, we shall be found so shamefully unprepared to co-operate with them, that I fear it will serve only to reflect disgrace on us and render us unworthy of their notice in future. The enemy remain quiet in and about New York. They have been ravaging and laying waste the country between the North River and the Sound. In short all their movements prove that they expect a siege at New York.  By dispatches just received from Europe our affairs in that quarter wear on the general face of them a very favourable aspect; a little more time and perseverance will assuredly confirm our Independence, and unless we are greatly deficient in virtue (which by the bye I fear) will render us a happy and respectable people.  My ammunition and time are both exhausted I shall therefore bid you adieu.  I have not yet got the last paper, but mean to procure and inclose you one.  I am, Dear General, Your Affec't Friend and humble Serv't,  Jn.

The English Papers say they had not sailed the 17th and there are Letters in Town which speak of their leaving Brest at a still later Period.  A Letter of the 8th ulto from Parsons, Alston and Co. at St Pierre, Martinique, has the following Paragraph.(2) \""The present serves to enclose a List of the Spanish Fleet mentioned in our last, as given out by one of the Of ficers of the Spanish Frigate that arrived at Fortroyal the 2nd inst.

Permit us only to observe, that in proportion as any state is deficient in the number of men, and quantum of supplies for the Army, Our prospect of success will be diminished, and should unhappily your state rely-that the exertions of other states will be competent to the business, and the same opinion be entertained by others, It is evident that disgrace and ruin must be the portion of this Country.

(1) A letter we have just been favourd with from Governor Jefferson, and which affords us great satisfaction, supercedes the necessity of addressing him on the present occasion.(2) JULY 13, 1780  The states have been Individually called upon for such portions of the supplies, they were required to furnish by the act of Congress of the 25th Feby. as there situation with respect to the point against which it is in Contemplation to direct the military operations of the Campaign, and their then, and present abilities, indicated to be not only proper but necessary and indispensible. The same principle prevailed in making the requisitions for Extra supplies; and the aggregate of the whole was estimated to be barely sufficient effectually to obtain the object in view, a retrospect to the return of what was required from each state, and which was inclosed in the letter we had the honor to address Congress on the 2d of June last will evince, that if the state of Pennsylvania either will not (which we do not suppose) or is not in a condition to comply with the requisition, A Co-operation with the force of our Ally, against any capital object, will be clearly impossible, unless other states can make good the deficiency of that, but until the Committee is advised, that Pensylvania refuses to comply or is incapable of furnishing the supplies allotted to it, In the whole or in part, We cannot enter upon a new apportionment of such deficiency to the other states.  We assure you sir, that altho we have the most Indubitable testimony that Governor Reed has received at least some of our letters, yet the state has not even deigned to acknowledge the receipt of any one. The Consequences that may result to the public from this Inattention on the part of that state, will so readily, & so fully occur to Congress, that we conceive it needless to elucidate the subject by any farther observations on it.  It is incumbent on us to advise Congress unless the state in question becomes sensible of the attention which is due to a Committee of Congress and conveys the necessary communications to us on the subject of our important Mission, that we shall decline addressing them in future. Persuaded that we should be culpable in suffering the dignity of the great Council of the United states to be wounded thro us by submitting to insult from any.

The State of Georgia, now in the Enemys possession; have at this time, four members present; their expences, which are not the smallest, paid by draughts; on the Continental Treasury, for which their state, is to be accountable when recovered from the Enemy.  A letter was this day read in Congress; from Genl Washington; seting forth the great want, of Marques, & Tents, Also another from the Q M.G, stateing the last, of the Number wanted, at the same time representing that it was out of his power to procure them, for want of Money.(2) Genl Washington, expressed an earnest desire, if Congress could not, furnish the money; that they would recommend, to the Merchants, of the four N. England states, to furnish them, in the same manner, that the Merchants of this City, furnish provision, and Rum, for the Army. The letter is refered to a Committee, of all the N England delegates. They have not made any report. But am ready to beleive they will report, in favour of the plan proposed by the General,(3) for it is out of the power of Congress, to furnish them, with out the immedite assistance, of the States or individuals.

I am repeatedly called on by Congress, and the members, to know what the little state of Rhode Island is doing, in this time of distress.

Untill within a few day when I had the good luck, to receive the Gazette, Containing the Laws, for Emitting £20,000, and for raising Six hundred and od[d] men, for filling up our Continental Battallions the whole was highly satisfactory to Congress.

I am happy to be informed that Connecticutt are in so fair a way to furnish their Quota of Troops & cannot but hope a Spirit of  JULY 14, 1780  necessary exertion is increasing in general. It is with pleasure I can assure you there is greater appearance of it in this State than I have seen for Some years, & believe Should the Armament arive which is now daily expected from France we Shall See vigorous exertions.  General Gates is ordered to take the Command in the Southern department, & I most devoutely wish his former good Fortune may Still attend him.  I am Sorry to find so much difficulty in Sending letters direct to Litchfield. Safe oppertunities come to my knowledge not so frequent as were desirable it being out of the post road, were it in the line of the post I should Trouble you with my correspondence much oftener; & I hope be less forgetfull of yours.

  Madam July 14th.1780 Your favour of June 13th (1) reached me this Morning. I will endeavour to write intelligibly in answer; but, alas! I have already fallen into my old track, and must give a note of explanation before I proceed further. N.B. The above underscoring means that I love flattery and a flatterer; nay, more, tho it may seem contradictory to the first part of my nota bene, it means that I love Saucyness and a Saucy-box. I think that I have done away all the \""enigmatical\"" part of the word as it respected one particular epistle, and was not written in that honest sense in which I generally make use of it to mark whatever comes to me from the pen of Portia.  I will endeavour to accomplish speedily what you wish in regard to the Balance of long standing in favour of Mr. A.  You will find from the inclosed Gazette the Substance of 3 of Mr. A's Letters recd. the 10th of this month.(2) There was another very long one of Apr. 3d but it contained only what had been before published here respecting the Affairs of the United Provinces of the Netherlands. As to what I promised about his former Letters, you afterwards appeared to have had the substance of them so far as related to his travails; and I judged you also got by the Marquis a Knowledge of Mr. A's Situation in France. I will, notwithstanding catch the Leisure to see whether I can send you any Novelty from them. (Your mention of one of my Letters without date, and at the same time reminding me of such a promise in a late Letter confounds me because I find yours of May 24th endorsed \""recd. June 12-answered 13th.\"" (3) Mr.  JULY 14, 1780  A's Letters were read 15 of May) (4) I have had a good Opportunity of sending to Mr. A. this morning by Mr. Searle a Member of Congress for Pensylvania and shall in a few days have another by Mr. Laurens, late President. I have forwarded a Commission to him to execute what was entrusted to Mr. L. as to a Loan in Holland-and another Commission which he is to deliver to Mr. D[ana] for the same Purpose in case of his own Inability upon any Score.(5) The Business was too critical to risque upon Mr. L's safe Passage. The Commissions are only provisory till he or another arrives. Mr. A's Embassy was considered as too important to be absolutely broken in upon by a decisive order from hence. He signified to me his Readiness to undertake any Thing of public Utility to fill up those Hours of Leisure which british Backwardness towards a Treaty of Pacification might give him.  I think I sent you on the 13th the Orders to Doctr. F[ranklin] to pay Mr. A. and D. their Salaries.  I am called off. I care not what Comments you make upon my general Style and manner if you will only own to me that you do not think me enigmatical when I profess myself Madam, Affectionately your Friend and Servt., JL  ""

  Dear General Philada. 15th July, 1780 My late indisposition (of which I am now better) has prevented an earlier acknowledgement of your favours dated at Travellers Rest. This City for near ten days past has been so warm that persons of a relaxed habit bore the heat with great difficulty. It is now somewhat abated & the air has more energy.  By some late intelligence from New York (amongst wch we are told the British are making a Strong Fort on Long Island opposite the Town) and also by a prize brigg this day brought up our River, we can not doubt but that the French Fleet is now on some part of our Coasts, but before I send off this letter the event will probably be better assertained.  Of late the general part of business before Congress is only of the Executive kind-two or three Resolutions in the legislative Stile I  JULY 15, 1780  shall briefly touch. The manner of paying off the Principal & Interest of our borrowed money, and fixing the Era of depreciation to the 1st of Sepr.-77, and the progressive depreciation from thence to the 18th of March-80, with Tables shewing the different Sums to be received by the Creditors according to the time of lending. (1) This Resolution I hope will give general Satisfaction, not being framed on the Skeleton of naked justice, which indeed coud not be assertained, but in the line of justice Self evident & illustrious, or if you please, on the Scale of liberal policy. The Qr.Master department has undergone a revisal, and a temporary System is framed, somewhat different from the former which will be Sent you, and in which Commissions are laid aside & a Sallary adopted.(2)  18th-We cannot doubt but that Adl.

  Sir, In Committee of Congress, Precaness July 16. 1780. Your letter of the 14th Instant with the several papers inclosed was delivered us this morning.(1)  We observe in your letter of the 19th ultimo to Congress that you have stated the degree of responsibility which you think ought to be required of you on the expenditures of monies in the quarter master general's department, and that you have requested the sense of Congress on that subject; As you have not obtained their determination, As the system for conducting your department, reported by this Committee has not, to our knowledge, been decided upon; As the  JULY 16, 1780  Commander in Chief, impelled by necessity, has directed you to arrange it, in some effectual manner to give dispatch and efficacy to your measures equal to the present exigency; And as you decline making the necessary appointments until this Committee afford you their opinion on the degree of responsibility by which you ought to be held, as quarter master general, in the Expenditure of public money, They conceive it incumbent on them, in order to prevent the evils which may arise to the public from a dissolution of the department, before the sense of Congress can be obtained, to give you their opinion on the subject.  We have maturely considered the reasons which you assign in your letter to Congress in support of your proposition, and we assure you they appear so cogent to us, that we do not hesitate to declare our sentiments Generally Coincident with those you have stated in the third paragraph of the letter to which we have alluded.  With respect to the resolution of the Treasury board of the 23d March last, requiring Estimates approved of by the board of war to accompany every application for money, to prosecute the business of the department, we must suppose to have originated from a want of the necessary information, or it would have occured that a strict adherence to the order in your department under our Circumstances, must of necessity, in some cases involve the Army in great difficulties, and in others prove absolutely ruinous. It would be easy to state a variety of instances, which, from the nature of things, must occur in every campaign in support of this opinion, but we decline giving them, as it would, we Conceive, be like demonstrating a self evident proposition.  In Justice to you, Sir, we embrace this occasion to declare that after having examined your arrangement of the quarter master general's department we are convinced the measures you have adopted, and the principles on which these measures were founded, were well calculated to promote the service, whilst they fully evinced your attention to the public interest; How far your arrangements have been complied with, by your subordinate officers; whether these have appointed more assistants than what were absolutely necessary properly to conduct the business, whether they have adopted the most prudent measures in the purchases, and expended the public property with a proper degree of economy, are questions we are not in a situation to determine, nor does it appear necessary we should on this occasion. We have the Honor to be, with great respect and esteem, Sir, Your most obedient servants,  Philip Schuyler,  Nathl. Peabody.  ""

  Dear Sir, Camp Precaniss July 16, 1780 About a fortnight ago I was favored with a Letter from you without date. I was much Indisposed when It came to hand and have Continued so until two days ago, this has prevented me not only from answering Your Letter from the additional pleasure I should have had in compl[y]ing with Mr Webbs wish or rather In Striving to get It Complied with.(1) I assign tomorrow for that business and hope the business will be settled to my satisfaction which will Include his & Yours.  Divines Observe that In a State of Beatitude we shall reflect with pleasure on the distresses we may have experienced in this life. I believe the position, for I Experience something very like It, with all this Clod of Clay about me, I exult in the reflection that neither Calumny or the variety of Injury I have sustained has ever either In thought or deed Induced me for a single moment to swerve from my duty and as I am too much a man of pleasure to marr It by harbouring resentment, I have long since divested myself of that disagreeable Companion and can with strict truth declare that I entertain none even against those who from a depravity of heart have attempted to Injure me. If such have not yet learnt to forgive the man they have Injured, which they seldom do, so much the worse for them. I am persuaded you will forgive me this Egotism because you are Influenced by similar principles of which you have given a generous evidence, In the present as In past exigencies to which your Country has been Exposed.  JULY 16, 1780  I Observe with the most sensible satisfaction that the States in general are roused, that they become Convinced of their danger, and are pursuing measures to avert the Evils which threatned to Involve us In one Common ruin. You remark with great propriety that the times call for Great Exertion and that our affairs demand a bold resolute use of power, and that Congress must have new and Extensive powers. Indeed, Indeed It is necessary they should. It Invovles an absurdity that the propriety of the recommendations of the directing powers of the Empire should be Complied with or not as It may be thought Expedient by the States. I contemplate with anxious Concern that If ever the Enemy should be reduced a few Years will bring on Civil Contests which will deluge this Country In blood; some thing should be done to avert It. I wish a Convention from the States could be assembled at an early day to form a Constitution for Congress and agree upon the principles of a Confederation. If this were done, perhaps It would tend to preserve unanimity for ages and promote the weal of the Empire. If It should be Insisted on that by an early day, the States who claim an Extent to the South seas or whose western limits are Indefinite Should all be restricted by a Certain western Extent not too far from the sea, that the Territory beyond such line of restriction should become the property of the United States, that it should be laid of[f] into States but not organized until Inhabited by a Determined number of people, that In the meantime the Inhabitants should be subject for every purpose of Government to the States within whose north and south bounds Continued they might fall-That an Immediate Settlement of the disputed boundary between any States Should be determined by a given day and the mode prescribed by the Convention-That the governing power should be Invested with the Sole right of making peace & war and all Commercial regulations with foreign powers- that appeals should lay to the Soveriegn power on all decissions in the Courts of any State on Controversys with the Subjects of any foreign powers, that the requisitions of Congress should be complied with by Every State without Debates on the propriety or Impropriety of the demand leaving to the States, the mode of furnishing what might be demanded, except for soldiers which should be engaged upon one General plan, to prevent any one state from bidding against another, That where a State conceives Itself Injured by an over charge, It shall be at Liberty after having Complied, to represent the Grievance, that If proper an abatement may be made on a subsequent requisition-That the governing power Should appoint officals for the Army-And that one General principal should be Established within one Year after the Conclusion of this war for apportioning to the States their quotas of men & money &c.  If some thing like this was done, I should hope that our Successors for ages to come would Enjoy as much happiness as It is permitted  to Mortals to Enjoy. I should beg you a thousand pardons for all this Impertinence but I rely on your friendship which will Impute to my Anxiety for the happiness of Posterity.

Thus Circumstanced I am Necessitated to remain in Camp Contrary to my wish, & vastly injurious to my private interest-with little prospect, of rendering essential Services-And less of giving Satisfaction to the various orders, degrees, & societies of men, necessarily Composed of Individuals, widly differing in their Customs, manners, interests, views and attachments, whom the Committee by their Missions are Necessitated to Transact very important Business with & for.  The French fleet is now arrived, and some few recruits are daily Joining our Army. The plan of Operation for this Campaign agreed upon, in full Confidence that the States will rigidly Comply with the requisitions made on them. Tho we have not been favoured with a Single line from Your State, Not so much as even to acknowledge the Recet. of any one of our letters, Yet from the Zeal, & exertions the State have heretofore uniformly discovered upon less important Occasions, both the Commander in Chief, and the Committee' have little room left to doubt your unremitting efforts in the present instance.  Most of the other states have given us very explicit assurances that Nothing Shall be wanting on their part to Compleat the Great object in view. Massachusetts have Singular merit, and You would be Surprised at the instantaneous exertions of some other States. It is in Contemplation for one of the Committee to visit the Assembly of the Eastern States upon matters of interesting importance, probably it will be my Tour, and it would be a happy Circumstance in my favour, if the expectations of the Public, and the Trust reposed in me should not render it indispensable immediately to return.

  In Committee of Congress Sir Preakness, July 18, 1780. We do ourselves the honor to transmit your Excellency copy of a letter from the Quarter Master General, Marked A, with copies number 1 to 13 of sundry papers delivered therewith, and of our Answer B.(1) We hope the reasons assigned for our interference on this occasion will meet the approbation of Congress. The fleet and land force of our Ally are arrived at Rhode Island; a few days refreshment will put the latter in condition to take the field; and the former to point its operations where it may be directed. The eyes of Europe generally, and those of all America are intently turned to Congress, and to the operations of their Army in this Campaign. Those of the powers of Europe, in order to determine our Character, and to judge by the event of this Campaign whether it will be prudent to espouse our Cause or to throw their weight in the opposite Scale. Those of America in anxious expectations that an attempt will be made to expel the Enemy from that strong hold, whence they have given these states so much annoyance. The hopes of the people are raised in proportion to the exertions of the states.  But as we cannot contemplate without horror, the effects of disappointment-as we apprehend that it will be experienced from the want of exertion in some states; It behoves this Committee entrusted to call forth the resources of the Country, in order to enable the army to act with vigour and efficacy in any Co-operation with the force from France; to recapitulate the measures they have pursued to accomplish the object of their appointment and thereby afford an oppertunity to their Constituents, and if necessary, to their compatriots to judge whether they have conducted with propriety or not; and to whom the misfortunes which will result from an inactive campaign will be Justly imputable.  On the 23d of May we were honored with the Acts of Congress of the 19th of that Month directing us to require from the states JULY 18, 1780  whatever was necessary to enable our Army to Co-operate with the then expected succour from France. On the 25th we addressed a circular letter to the states, in which we detailed the difficulties and distresses the army sustained, truly delienated its weakness and its wants; and remarked that every reliance for assistance and relief was placed in the states, both in point of recruits for the Army, the necessary provisions to subsist it; and the means of transportation. We earnestly entreated their attention to these important objects, and that they would adopt such measures as would most effectually accomplish the great views Congress had in Contemplation, and we concluded our address with, exhibiting the probable consequences which inattention, neglect or want of adequate exertion would produce. On the 31st May the Commander in Chief in a letter to the Committee, urged the necessity of knowing with precision the means America would have in her power to employ in an operation with the Combined force against the object, he had in view, and of which we were advised. In consequence of this application we wrote a third Circular letter to the states on the 2d June, requesting specific aids of men, provisions, forage, Horses, and Carriages to be attached to the Army, and the means of transportation for the variety of articles Incident to its wants. We stated the principles on which the allotments to each were made, we observed that the requisitions, tho large were barely competent, that they were the least adequate to the intended operations-that it appeared essential a proper understanding should prevail on all hands-that the states should be fully informed of our wants, That the General and the Committee should be clearly and explicitly advised of the ability of the states, both individually & Collectively, and to have what might be expected and relied on determined with precision. Exigencies which have subsequently arisen, impelled to the necessity of reiterated applications, Copies of which have been regularly transmitted to Congress.  It was reasonable to conclude that every state so fully advised of the alarming situation of public affairs, would not have left any measure to which it was equal unassayed, to preserve the empire from the impending ruin with which it was threatened to support its honor, and maintain its Character amongst the powers of the Earth, and effectually to establish the great object to accomplish which they had already expended such a deluge of blood. We have learnt with the most sensible satisfaction, that the people in most of the states are roused from the torper which had so generally prevailed. That a due sense of duty to their Country has with all ranks of men been productive of a patriotic activity evincing that they mean effectually to support the Common Cause-that some of the states, from whom aid has been required have explicitedly advised us of their intentions, whilst others have been partial & some altogether silent on the subject.   Massachusetts Bay has engaged Compleatly to Comply with the requisitions of Congress and this Committee in every article. Rhode Island has done the like, except as to the militia and the article of Rum on which they have not been explicit. Connecticut has engaged to Comply in the whole, altho the Governor expresses a doubt If the state will be able to furnish all the flour & salt. New York has engaged to Comply in the whole, but the Governor observes that the short forage can not be immediately supplied; but that the whole quantity called for, will be delivered directly after harvest. New Jersey has engaged to furnish the provisions required of them, the horses and waggons to be attached to the Army-to empress carriages for transportation in the Counties of Hunterden-Burlington-Montmouth-Essex and Sussex; To compleat their three Battalions, but do not say to what number-\""but they have not vested in any persons such powers as to enable them on the requisition of Congress or their Committee to draw forth the military resources of the state.  Delaware, has generally engaged to comply with the requisitions of Congress and of this Committee, and the Governor has given assurances that he will exert himself to the utmost, but no horses, Waggons, or forage have yet been delivered. Maryland has engaged to compleat her Battallions to the Establishment of 504 Rank & file- by raising 1469 Men to serve during the War and to raise another battallion for the same term; If by this, she can be excused from furnishing her Militia, \""unless in cases of extreame emergency.\"" The General and the Committee conceiving this an offer favourable to the United states have acquiesed in the proposition, but she has given no assurances on any other part of our requisitions. Virginia, by subsequent Acts of Congress to those of the l9th May being directed to dispose of her supplies for the southern Army, except so much short forage as could be spared for the Army, has given assurances that the greatest quantity possible will be sent. From New Hampshire, we have no official accounts; private information advises that it is exerting itself. Pensylvania, has not favour'd us with a single line, in answer to the various applications we have made; Some horses but a number vastly short of what we required have been sent to the Army-a quantity of Beef whether exceeding or not the quantity required, we cannot say. A little a very little flour, not more than fifty Barrels as the Commissary General informs. A little Rum, no Bacon, no forage that the Quarter Master General knows of, no Waggons, Some recruits for the Army-but we are informed that they do not intend to Compleat their Battallions to the establishment recommended by the General and the Committee. We are ignorant of the measures if any, which they have taken to draw forth the 3465 militia required of them.(2)  Thus Sir, have we stated the prospects we have and Congress will perceive that the General & the Committee are far from being able  to determine with precision what may be expected, consequently the former finds himself embarrassed and distressed in the moment when every doubt should have been removed, and when every hour is of such importance-that if not clearly improved, the success of the operations will be greatly endangered. In this Crises, when the honor and reputation of Congress & their constituents are so eminently exposed-when a want of Virtue and exertion clearly involves the destruction of the Empire; we conceived it our indispensible duty, as public men, and part of the directing council of the federal union, charged with an important Mission, plainly to expose facts without exaggeration; but without disguise or palliation. If we had remaind silent we should have been culpable. If we had been deterred by the fear of offending, It would have argued an unbecoming pusilanimity. These sentiments have influenced us, and under that influence we shall continue our observations, and intreat the attention of Congress to the return which accompanied our letter of the 2d June last. In which is stated the number of men & quantum of supplies requested from each state. We wish Congress to compare what is required from each with the aggregate of the whole, and it will be evinced that the non-Compliance of such a state as Pensylvania will render it impossible to prosecute the operations which the Commander in Chief contemplates. It will appear that any considerable deficiency on her part will render it difficult to act offensively at all; and that she is not surcharged in the allotment made, when her extent of Country- her Numbers-her Commerce-and her resources are compared with those of the other states. But if Pensylvania will not, or willing, cannot afford, at least a great portion of what has been requested of her-and if we cannot without her aid prosecute the object of the Campaign, Is it not time to put a stop to the great exertions which several of the states are making? We think it is, least they should so far exhaust themselves as to be hereafter render'd incapable of the means of defence, unless measures can be adopted to induce every state to afford those aids which are necessary to promote the weal of the Union, and to establish its Independance on a permanent & lasting Basis.  The arrival of the french force, and the hopes which were afforded the Commander in Chief that by the exertions of Congress & the states, he would be put in condition to Co-operate with the succour of our Ally, render'd it incumbent on him to take the necessary steps for operation. Among other things, he directed that the flour in Sussex County should be remov'd with all expedition to Hudsons River, Carriages were required of this state to convey it to Warrick, in the state of New York, beleiveing that they would be obtained; he orderd that others should be procured in that state to convey it to Hudsons River; upwards of an hundred of the latter went to the place, but no flour had arrived there; the Inhabitants of this State   absolutely refusing to go, unless they were immediately paid, altho urged by every consideration which could influence their humanity, or their feelings as Citizens; hence the flour, small as the quantity is, remains in Sussex, the troops at West Point, rapidly increasing in number, and a few days is to bring on, another involuntary fast, in that quarter.  General Knox, has likewise been ordered to remove a variety of stores, to Hudsons River, and to apply to the Quarter Master Genl. for the means of transportation, which must be considerable. Inclose you Copy of General Greenes Letters on the subject, marked C(3) To procure carriages by military aid, on very sudden emergency's is not only right, but may be eligable on the occasion; but to rely on it, in a serious operation which will probably continue for months, would be precarious, inadequate, and ruinous to the Army, and to the inhabitants. We do not mean that it Should be infer'd that this state, which has already greatly exerted itself in this Line, is any degree equal to the transportation of the Stores, which must pass through it in the course of the Campaign. It can afford considerable assistance, but it must be aided by others, and it is impossible to mistake by which.(4)  The adjutant General and his Deputies-The judge Advocate and his-The Regimental adjutants, Quarter Masters, surgeons & Mates have requested us to obtain a determination of Congress whether they are considered as Entitled to that justice which has been done to the line of the Army by the act of the 9th of April last-and whether at the Conclusion of the War they are to partake of the bounty of the states in point of Land and other emoluments.(5) Connecticut has setled the depreciation with the surgeons and Mates, in their line, on the original establishment of 1776. Representations have been made us on this head, and they claim it on the subsequent establishment which guided the settlement with the other Officers; We mention this matter that it may be considered in the deliberations of Congress on the subject of this paragraph, and we intreat a speedy determination in order to remove the fears and jealousies which prevail in regard to this matter, and we wish, if possible that the decision should be extended to comprehend such Officers in the civil departments of the Army as have served on daily or monthly pay, in order to prevent that multiplicity of applications with which we are daily perplexed, and to Erradicate this source of discontent.  Mr. Schuyler in a letter of 6th Instant (the Committee being absent) mentioned the inconveniency which the Officers labourd under, in not receiving the subsistance money for the retaind rations.(6) In answer to their applications on this distressing Subject, Assurances were given that Congress would be advised of the matter; and that a speedy decision would be requested. Indeed Sir, the disagreable spirit which is already unhappily too prevalent on this occasion is increasing and  unless speedily attended to, may be productive of serious consequences.  Yesterday two Officers of Colo. Hazens Regiment waited on Us,(7) and represented in behalf of themselves and others that they had left their native Country, to follow our fortunes, that previous to their leaving Canada they made Considerable disbursements in Specie to promote our service, Colo Hazen assures us to the amount of about five hundred pounds sterling, and that it is included in his accounts, which are passed but remain unpaid. These officers are, as they declare, so destitute of Cloaths that they are incapable of doing duty, and some of their family's residing in different parts of the Country, are suffering for want of the mere necessary's of life. Their case is peculiar, they have no friends from whence they can draw Assistance; humanity pleads so strongly in their favour that we cannot dispence with most earnestly recommending that some money should be advanced them without delay.  The Commander in Chief, has put into our hands a letter from the Board of War to him on the subject of military Stores,(8) and desired us to take some steps in consequence of it. In this letter the board observes that \""the time is too short for complying with the Estimate for Sixty days, that they are convinced of the utter impracticability of procuring more than half the amount of the Estimate last sent.\"" That \""had they money and were time enough allowed them for procuring the shott & Shells, they are convinced a sufficient quantity of powder could not be obtained .\"" That \""they will do their utmost to procure the articles mentioned in the Estimate for thirty days, but thought it unnecessary to begin the provision without being informed whether or not the business can be undertaken. If the articles agreable to the thirty days Estimate as at first furnished can be had, and they beg His Excellency's speedy answer on the subject.\"" The letter is of the 11th Inst. and was not received until four O Clock Yesterday. It were to be wished that the board had gone on with the matter, as far as was possible for them to do, that so much time as must now of necessity be lost might have been saved. We intreat the business may be spiritedly entered on, and upon the largest Estimate, and the articles forwarded from time to time as they are prepared; We mention the largest Estimate as the board will perceive that in the one which they have transmitted, they state as on hand In Pensylvania sundry articles, which General Knox had already included in his Return, as part of the amount which he stated to be in hand, hence the deficiency's appear to be less than they really are.  The Board presumes General Knox, can influence the proprietors of Iron Works in this State to enter on the business of Casting shott & shells. Mr. Faesh has given proposals, to make about two hundred Tons. We have requested him to commence the work and have given   him assurances we would recommend that he will receive the same allowance which is, or may be given by the board of War, in the State of Pensylvania, and that we would likewise recommend that he should be furnished with the money he requires, which is \""Twenty thousand pounds immediately or five thousand pounds weekly, on account, or he will give loan Office Certificates in lieu to that amount.\"" We believe he will acceed to this, and hope the Congress approves That measures may be pursued to furnish the money.(9)  General Greene has transmitted us Copy of a letter from Mr. Wadsworth to him, which we have the honor to inclose marked D.(10)The subject is interesting. General Greene informs us that the forage required from the Eastern states cannot be converted to the use of the french Troops, as there will not be a sufficiency for ours, especially since the supply required from Virginia depends on the contingency of that state being able to spare any without, distressing the Southern Army. It seems necessary that this business should claim the earliest consideration of Congress.  Colo. Hazen has presented us a memorial accompanied with other papers marked E. As it is far from being within the line of our duty to decide upon the contents; we transmit them to your Excellency for the inspection of Congress. A Monsieur Garranger has also put into our hands a memorial F which for similar reasons we also transmit.(11)  In our remarks on the requisition made of Pensylvania and in stating what we are advised she has furnished, we took no notice of that generous aid of the associated Company of her Citizens, because we conceived an evident distinction, between the exertions of a state and some individuals of it-nor will that Assistance capital as it is militate against our conclusion \""that the military operations in contemplation cannot be prosecuted,\"" without great exertions in the Government of that state.(12)  By resolutions of Congress the Commander in Chief is restricted in his operations to the limits of the United States. It would be easy to assign a variety of conclusive reasons, that such restraint may be attended with many disagreable consequences, whilst no[t] a single advantage can possibly result from it. But we wave stating them as we conceive the restriction has arisen from mere accident in wording the resolution, and that barely mentioning it, will lead to a reconsideration. If the General has not conveyed you his sentiments on the occasion, we are inclined to impute it to a delicacy which may not permit him to request an extention of power, rather than to any doubt he may entertain on the propriety of the measure we allude to as necessary. Should the Sentiments of Congress be coincident with ours on this subject, the present posture of affairs will indicate that their decision cannot be too early conveyed to this quarter.(13)  We have the honor to be, With great Respect & Esteem, Your Excellency's Most Obedt. Humble servants,  Ph. Schuyler Nathl. Peabody (14) ""

  Dear Sr, Phila. 18th July 1780 A Report from the Board of War in consequence of a Letter of Genl. Gates's to Congress refd. to the Board respecting the promotion of Col. Danl. Morgan to the office of Brigadier General, now  JULY 18, 1780  lies upon the Table, at my request. The Board have stated his former Services-his being first Colonel of our Line, and the deficiency of that State at present in her Quota of Troops. If a promotion of General officers is to take place and to be made through the line of the Army Morgan has many before him but if the promotions are to be through the line of the State that officer it appears stands first. Genl. Gates has mentioned his intention of giving Morgan the Command of a Body of light Infantry, but as the State has given the command of the Militia lately sent to the Southward to Col. Stevens who was Morgans junior officer in the Continental line with the Commission of Brigadier General he will command Col. Morgan and this Gates thinks will disgust him and therefore with great earnestness and warmth presses his promotion. I shall thank you for your confidential communications upon this matter as the Report I think will not be pressed or taken up untill the Virga. Delegates are fully informed as it was upon my motion to obtain time for information it lies upon the Table. Besides as he left the Army in disgust under your immediate command I did not like the present mode of his obtaining the promotion, without (that I know of) any alteration of circumstances, at the pressing instance of General Gates.(1) Pray my dear Sr. do you recollect the purport of a Letter lately written to Col. Harrison Speaker of the Delegates, representing the deranged state of the French Finances theirs as well as Spains declining Navy and the increasing growing Strength of the British Navy. I have heard of such a Letter that Gentleman received from you and had shewn it to many of the Members of our assembly and that it was like to prejudice rather than promote the Service. I mention this is confidence as the purport of the Letter may have been misrepresented and I have it not directly from one who saw it or heard it read. Between ourselves I fear that worthy Man is no zealous Friend of the Alliance-I may be mistaken but it is my present opinion.(2) An account transmitted the Admiralty Board by Genl. Foreman makes the British on the N. York Station nine line of Battle Ships, two or three fiftys and 17 Frigates and other armed Vessells-should this intelligence be true the French Fleet as we have been told (though we have not yet the particulars of their strength) will be unequal to the undertaking. My Letters from Virga. speak of our people as being roused-a Bill had passed the Delegates by a Majority of 3 only adopting the scheme of Finance recommended by Congress-thirteen of the Senate only were present the opinion of ten of these publicly known five for & five agt. the Bill. It was conjectured the others were in favour of the measure. Every 15th Militia man is to be drafted to fill up the deficiency of our line, this Bill was also before the Senate. I hope you find the Recruits coming in fast-the news of the arrival of the Fleet will accelerate them. With great respect I am, Dr. Sr., yr. aff hum. Servt. Jos. Jones.  ""

These considerations in addition to those which arise from reflecting that it will redound to the honor and Credit of the states, Induce us to advise (if your Excellency thinks it will afford satisfaction to the army) that the Cloathing arrived from france, should be distributed amongst such of the men, as are engaged during the War. That the uniforms now possessed by these, should be given to the recruits, who are to serve to the end of the Campaign. But as this will deprive those who are engaged for the war, of the use of the Cloaths, which must in this case be considered as their own property: We think, If they insist upon it, that appraisment should be made, and assurances given them, that the value will be paid.

The General having thrown the decision of that matter on Congress, we are now tormented with reading the rubish of large bundles of testimony, but not yet come to the Doctors defence which will probably end, indeed must end, in approving the Sentence of the Court Martial.(1)  Great Exertions are proposed & expected from the middle & Eastern States relative to the Object-New-York.

  In Committee of Congress Camp  Sir, Preakness July 21 1780 We are honoured with your letter of yesterday's date covering an Estimate delivered you by General Knox, stating the weight of Ordnance Stores, for which he requires the means of transportation; with one of yours, exhibiting what number of Carriages will be necessary to move those stores, and others you mention from Trenton to Dobbs Ferry.(1) You wish to be inform'd \""Whether the Committee can give you full assurances, that such aid will be given in the business of transportation both with respect to teams and forage, and all other matters of Contingency dependant on the same, as will authorize you to engage to the General to perform the transportation required.\"" (2) Convinced of the impractacability of prosecuting extensive military operations without ample means of transportation; the Committee have long since recommended it to the attention of the states individually-New Jersey, Pensylvania, and Delaware seem to be the only States from which Carriages can be drawn for what stores may be moved from Trenton to Dobbs Ferry, and any intermediate or adjacent places, South of the Highlands and West of Hudsons River. The Government of this State, has empowred the Magistrates to impress teams, when required; but on a recent occasion they could not be procured in that manner. The Government of Pensylvania, has not advised us of their intentions on this, or any other subject. The Governor of Delaware has promised that the state will exert itself to the utmost; generally to comply with the requisitions of this Committee; hence we are not sufficiently informed to decide what reliance can be made on their aid, or how far the Governments of  JULY 21, 1780  those states will interpose to procure it. The Committee in a late letter to Congress have been very Explicit on the subject of the various supplies requisite to put the Army into a state of activity, and impressed as that body undoubtedly is, with the importance of having matters of such high moment to the weal of their Constituents ascertained with every possible degree of precision, they will probably come to an ecclaircisment with the states; and it seemes impossible that the latter should not be impelled to adequate exertion when they shall be convinced that the General cannot avail himself of any advantage which may offer or commence an operation whatever his force may be, unless supplied with the requisite stores and that an inactive Campaign will involve the states in a series of distress, which no friend to his Country can contemplate without the deepest anxiety; nor will the Committee fail to reiterate their observations on the subject. But should those states in whom a reliance must be more immediately placed for this aid, and which you assure us they are competent to be capable of a measure so injurious as to withold it; We shall certainly not hesitate to advise and request that the Military be employed to assist you, in obtaining the necessary Carriages, persuaded that men who have entered into that profession to preserve their dearest rights as Citizens will execute the disagreable duty with every possible decree of tenderness, and relying that we shall stand Justifyed with the virtuous part of the Community, who whilst they with us lament the necessity of the measure, will decide that of the two evils we had avoided the greater.  The Committee Sir, are sensible that providing the Teams & forage under the present plan of procuring supplies and aid, thro the medium of state agents not immediately dependant on your Department as Quarter Master General, does not render you accountable for their mal-conduct. We consider it, however, your duty to make the requisitions to the states and to prosecute every means in your power to obtain both. The Committee see with anxious concern the embarrasments which incessantly arise from such extensive dependence on the states for every supply-That it is productive of partial burthens on particular states from their local situation-That it will ever create a reluctance in the individuals of such states to the public service-That whilst a want of money compels Government to committ their affairs to persons not accountable to those whose reputation in a great measure depends on the Conduct of such persons; It is impossible business should be prosecuted with either propriety or economy and persuaded that nothing can remedy this evil, and confine business to its proper Channel, unless the confidence of the Inhabitants is regained by adequate assurances that the debts due or such as may become due will be discharged without loss to the Creditors, and unless the Quarter Master Generals Department be supplied with money to pay for the necessary contingency's thereof.   Under this persuasion, the Committee will earnestly intreat Congress to turn their attention to both.  As many of the stores included in Genl. Knox's Estimate are at West Point and places East of Hudsons River, and others much nearer to Dobbs Ferry than Trenton, and as the whole quantity required will not be procured in time on this side of Hudsons River, We conceive the calculation of carriages on his Estimate very considerably too high. We also believe a dimunition might take place in the others as the whole quantity of forage will not be carried on to Hudsons River-that of Virginia being directed another way, and that a substitute for it, will in all probability be drawn from New York and the more Eastern States. We wish you to reconsider the Estimate that the application may be the least that will effectually suffice, as it will diminish the difficulty in obtaining them, and evince that every attention is paid to the ease & Convenience of the states.(3)  We Are Sir, With great respect, Your Most Obt.

The regulations for the Quartermaster department I mentioned in my last,(1) Meta- JULY 21, 1780  morphosed as it is, passed Congress a few days since,(2) and is ordered to take place immediately. As it is now in the press & will be sent to you, I shall say no more on that subject.  Mr. Elsworth who is gone home to Conecticut, was your fast Friend, and his Country's friend. Mr. Shearman-he is full in the faith, that no more expence, aught to be created than the People will annually pay by Taxes. Yet I belive you may set the state of Conecticut, down as your Friend, if that can be determined by the Majority of their Delegates. Mr. Inger[soll] hath predujuced me much in his favour, he appears at all times to be governed, by principal of the strictest Honour and justice. Mr. Matlock is a strange Mortal, for a man of sence, I never know one day, where to find him the next, he hath a great notion of being a Courteor, perhaps in some Countries, he would appear a course Courteor. As for Livingston, Scott, & Duane, they were for Curtailing every sallery, fixed in the Q Master's System. They have something in view, what I am not certain. They make me think of the snake in the grass. It is often thrown out in Congress, as a burlesque, that who can expect such and such things of you, when you had the Modesty to write Congress you would serve them for Three Thousand a year stirling. Perhaps more of this in my next.  Congress are very Sanguine in their Expectation, on the intended offensive opperations. It is not popalar, even to suppose a Miscariage, in case, any unforeseen accident should happen, much less to mention any of those difficulties, that at present, to me appear almost unsurmountable.  Congress in general appear exceeding easy in the present situation of affairs. There doth not appear the most distant wish for more powers, but rather on the Contrary, wish to see their States without controul (as the Term is) free, sovereign & Independant. If any thing appears difficult in regard to Supply &c. what can we do, why we can do nothing, the States must exert them selves, if they will not, they must suffer the Consequences.  For my own part I have been exceedingly disappointed in my expectations, in regard to Congress, and am still at a loss as to their motives and views, if the) have Any. There appears to be a langor, that attends all our Conduct, want of decision and Spirited measures. The greatest part of our time is taken up in disputes about diction, Commas, Colons, Consonants, vowels &c. More in my next. I impatiently wait to hear from Rhode Island.

 Jonathan Trumbull, Sr. Sir, Philadelphia July 22d 1780  The Journals of Congress for June last are Printed and will be forwarded to your Excellency in the usual Channel together with such Copies as are ordered Immediately.  It is with Concern we observe the Exigences of the Public have been such as obliged our State to Issue large Emissions of Paper Bills which with what will Issue in Pursuance of the Resolutions of the 18th of March last may Endanger the Public Credit. The only Way to avoid this Evil is speedily to Draw in those Bills by Taxes and not Suffer them on any Account to Re-Issue.  Paper Money does it's Office when it goes out in Payment and ought to be among the People as a Mediurn of Trade no longer than to find it's Way into their Pockets, and like private Security should be destroyed when Returned into the Office it Issued from, This is doing Business in Sight of the People and Every Man who Pays his Tax knous he does it Discharge of much of his Public Debt. But to Re-lssue Bills taken in by Loans & Taxes Accumulates the Public Debt in a Way not open to the Inspection of the People. They see the Bills are not Redeemed and are told they never will be. The Credit of the State is Scrupled and Depreciation Ensues. The People loose their Confidence in Government, The Laws are Enervated, Military Opperations Prevented, Justice Impeeded, Trade Embarrased, the Morals of the People Corrupted, Men of Integrity in Office Abused and Resigning whilst Peculators Ride in Coaches. These Evils and the Sources from whence they arise, so lately Experienced all serve to Point out the Way to avoid them in future. The Design of Congress in Limiting the Amount of Circulating Bills within the United States will be Wholly Defeated by Emissions from Particular States unless their Amount is Limited within the Bounds and Issued in Lieu of the Quotas Assigned by Congress, and be in Fact drawn in before the General Currency Issues.  Congress have Established a new Regulation of the Quarter Master's Department,(1) it's now in the Press and will be Transmitted to your Excellency as Early as Possible, it is Expected this new arrangement of that Department will save great Expence to the Public.

 Roger Sherman to Jonathan Trumbull, Sr.  Sir Philadelphia July 22. 178[0] Your Excellency's Several Letters to the President of Congress of the 10th Instant were received and publickly read.(1) No measures have Yet been taken by the Board of Treasury, for Sending Commissioners to Settle accounts in the Several States, which they are fully authorized to do by a late resolution of Congress. As I am at present a Member of that Board I Shall do every thing in my power to forward that Business, which has been too long delayed. Your Excellency's Letter of the 8th of June last was referred to a Committee who reported thereon the 6th of July. \""That all the Crediters of these united States who have not been paid their just demands, Shall be intitled to recieve in the present money, to the full value of the Sums due to them respectively, at the time they ought to have been paid.\"" When the report was taken up in Congress there was no objection to making just Allowance for the depreciation, but that it was Necessary to point out Some mode for the adjustment of the Sums due, and therefore it was recommitted-and will I suppose be again reported on very Soon.(2) Congress Seem disposed to do justice in every Case as far as is practicable.  Our affairs have been considerably retarded and Embarrassed for want of money, and for want of proper Arrangements of the Staff departments.  A New Arrangement of the Quarter Masters Department has lately been Established, which provides for the receiving, Safe keeping and transportation of the provisions and other Supplies to be purchased by the Several States, pursuant to the resolution of the 25th of February last, and for procuring other Supplies. All the officers Employed will be on Salary & not Commissions, issuing posts in the Country are to be discontinued, I believe it will be a means of Saving considerable expence if duly executed, tho' not So much as could be wished. New arrangements are also ordered for the commissary's and Medical departments, to be made by the Committee at Head Quarters, & reported to Congress. JULY 22, 1780  We are Informed that Admiral Graves has lately arrived at New York with Six Ships of the Line from 60 to 80 Guns. General Washington writes that his arrival will make no alteration in his Plan of operations. We have had Accounts of the Arrival of the French Fleet at New port, on the 10th Instant, but no particulars, in what force or in what condition. We hear from New York, that one 74 Gun Ship of Graves's fleet was Sunk by the French fleet, and that the French fleet is much Shattered. The people in the Several States Seem to be animated to Vigorous exertions;(3) A few months or weeks may be productive of very important events to this Country. May the Omnipotent disposer of all events overrule them for the best good of these States.  I understand that of late the Army have been well Supplied with provisions. I am Sorry that the State of Connecticut have had occasion to emit So large a Sum in Bills of Credit previous to their being furnished with the Bills prepared by order of Congress,(4) but am Glad to hear that they have laid So large a Tax to be paid in the New Bills, I esteem that to be a very wise measure, to introduce the Bills into circulation with full credit, and ought to be imitated by all the other States. I am fully perswaded that no way can be devised, in our circumstances to Support the value of a paper currency but by taxing to the full amount of our expenditures, after having emitted a Sufficient Sum for a Medium of trade which is limited by the resolution of Congress to ten millions of dollars for the thirteen States, and if the particular States extend their emissions beyond their quotas of that Sum, it will in my opinion give a fatal blow to the Credit of the whole paper currency, and involve us in worse evils than we have heretofore experienced. Therefore I think that No Supposed necessity, or other consideration Whatsoever Should induce any State in the least degree to exceed the limit fixed by the united States by the resolution of the 18th of March last.  I am sensible that it was Necessary to make Some State emissions before those Bills were prepared, but then I think they Should be considered as part of their quotas of the ten Million dollars. The resources of this Country are great and may be drawn out in So equable a Manner by the Wisdom of the Legislatures of the Several States as fully to answer the exigencies of our affairs, without being very burthensome to the people. It may be necessary to run in debt for Some foreign articles, but I think not for any that are to be procured in this Country. I Shall return home by the middle of August So as to attend the circuit if relieved by the arrival of another Delegate. Mr. Root writes me that he dont expect to come 'till the beginning of October. I have wrote to General Wolcot (5) but have not yet received an Answer.  The bank Set up here for the Supply of the Army I hope will be attended with Some good effect-they purchase flour delivered in  JULY 23, 1780  this City at £80 Pennsylvania currency, in continental Bills, per Ct which at 60 for 1 is equal to 21/4 lawful money of Connecticut. Of the New Bills have been Sent to Connecticut about half their quota, to New Hamshire their whole quota, to Massachusetts including what is now Sent by Brown 540,000 dollars. The quota for N. York is done, but not Sent forward, the quota for New Jersy will be printed next. Eight States have Adopted the Measure, and we hear that Virginia has, which will make nine. Delaware has not yet, and we have No Account from N. Carolina. South Carolina is Not in a condition to do it at present.  Gates will be able to Collect such a force as to re-establish Civil Government there.  I am with great respect and Esteem, Your Excellency's Obedient humble Servant, Roger Sherman  ""

The inclosed No. 3, is copy of a letter from the commander in chief, to the quarter master general-No 4 is copy of his letter to us in consequence of the former-No. 5 and 6, are returns which accompanied it-No. 7, is copy of our letter in answer to his, No. 8 of his reply (2)  On a matter so important as that which is the principle object of these papers, we earnestly intreat to have the sense of Congress explicitly stated, and speedily conveyed to us. The committee were led to decide for a Military coercion in procuring carriages, if other means of obtaining them should prove ineffectual, because they conceived it a self evident proposition, that ample, but distant supplies of provision for such an Army as you have called into the field, without adequate means of transportation, must render every operation abortive, increase the distress of the Country, and call in question the wisdom of the directing council of the Empire.  Governor Livingston, with whom we have conversed since our last to Congress, has explained the quotation we gave from his letter respecting the \""Military resources of the State\""-he meant only to convey, that no new powers had been conferred on any person to call them out, but assured us that by former acts of the legislature, he is authorized, with his council to draw forth the Militia on the requisition of Congress, or General Washington.  The honorable President Weare, in letters of the I st, 2, and 6th, which we received on the 21 st instant, advises us that he has \""ocason to expect the major part at least\"" of the troops to recruit their line \""will rendezvous in the southern extremes of the State on the 4th of July.\"" That \""the Militia are ordered to be at the same places on the 12th, on their way to Camp.\"" That \""the quota of beef alloted to the State, for July, will be ready.\"" That \""the first months allotment of rum is ready.\"" That \""persons are employed to purchase the 150 horses required of them, and thinks it probable they will be ready in a few days.\"" That \""the legislature of the state have fully empowered the President with the committee of safety to call forth all and every resource of the State when wanted, in the recess of the general court, to whom we are to apply for future aid.\"" In his letter of the 6th, he observes \""upwards of one hundred recruits for the Continental Army had marched forward on the preceeding Tuesday & Wednesday from Kingston, and by the best information, they were equally forward in the Counties of Hillsborough and Cheshire.\""(3)  His Excellency the Governor of Maryland's information is also full,  and greatly satisfactory, as his letter is short, we deem it unnecessary to analize it, and therefore transmit a copy, No. 9.(4)  We have this day in concurrence with the commander in chief, annexed the regiment commanded by Colo.

There is of ficial accounts that Admiral Graves & Arburthnott, with Twenty one Ships of war, saild from Sandy Hook, making their Course S. E. by S, untill they were out of sight, their destination unknown, various are the Conjectures, some suppose Rhode Island, others that they are gone, in quest of the reinforcements expected from France.(1)  Since my arival at this place, I have spent a considerable part of my leisure time (of which I have plenty) in making my self acquainted, with the Institution, of the several Boards as ordered, by Congress, their several modes of doing business, the several Chambers of Accompts, and their method, together with the Conduct, of all persons imployed, in publick business under the immediate direction of either, of the Boards. Least I should be thought, either imprudent, or indelicate, I must omit entering into particulars, on this subject, But the want, of decision is evident, and often times in matters of great National concern; at this critical conjunture, and it too evident, that a general langor hath spread it self over all our publick transactlons.  Our Finances are in a most deplorable situation, and but little attention, paid in order to put them upon a more respectable footing. The task being difficult and the Complicated obstructions that always stare us in the face at first view, Appears to me to be the reason, that no more attention is paid to so great a National Concern, I wish the time may not be near, when the most fatal consequences will overtake us, mearly for want of money for Publick purposes, I wish you not to construe this letter, to be wrote by dictates of fear. I assure it is not, but with that truth and Sincerity that the servant of a free people ought to speak.  I have also paid attention to all our foreign inteligence, and upon the most favourable construction, I cannot se the least probability, of a peace taking place, unless some Capital stroke, can be struck this Campaign, in this Quarter. It is probable that Great Britain will JULY 24, 1780  purpose a Truce with the several States, for a limited time, the propriety of Conceeding to the measure, I must leave you to Judge, It appears the victory the Britons obtained at Savannah last fall, hath much revived, their spirits in Europe.

  Sir July 24th. 1780 A very safe Oppertunity now offering I cannot allow myself to be governed by the Ceremony of consulting my Colleagues afresh on the Propriety of communicating all which the Minister told Congress last Saturday. Indeed I let the Chevalier himself know that I shd. not make a Secret of any thing which could tend to invigorate the Measures of the States. I need not be minute. The Sum & Substance was that what Ships & Troops are arrived form only a Division of what is intended for Cooperation-that we may daily expect a second- and that if Britain chuses to follow the Scene will be continued. France & Spain being superior in Europe are determined to be so in America if they send every Ship they have swimming. The Chevalier de la Luzerne is more diffident about elevating our Expectations than the ministry of France appear to be, they make no Ifs & Ands of the Councils.  I wish you would converse with Messrs. Cushing and Danielson about a Point of Delicacy that most certainly ought to be settled. The first Letter which we recd. from those Gentlemen as a Committee to correspond with us has never been acknowledged;(1) and we can not apologize for ourselves without exposing the C___ss. Read  JULY 24, 1780  the Resolve (2) that passed concerning Warrants to be drawn by the Govr. & Council of Virginia on the Deputy Paymaster there, and then judge whether we were not entitled to suppose we should not be two days without Ability to inclose to the Gentlemen an answer to the main Part of their Letter. You see a motion of ours referred to the Treasury on the 23d of June.(3) We had made several attempts before that and upon one Objection and another consented to take back our Motions to amend them. Every Body seemed willing to do what was necessary yet nothing could be done, till at length I determined the Books should speak for us and would yet again take back the motion. To be plain I suspect the money which was in E. Hancock's Hand has been used by the Treasury in their Necessities tho it was the same as taking it out of the Pockets of the Guards in Mass. & other Soldiers there.  I had a few Lines from Mr. Izard dated the 12th at Rh Island(4)-- Arthur Lee is behind still. Some of his anxious friends seem to think he is in danger of being assassinated by some of his private Enemies there, but I think his detention is quite natural (5)-The Alliance having been employed in some jobbing Expedition cannot find its prize money and the Sailors will not come without it is first paid down to them. We have nothing material from the Southward, nor any Letters from Mr. Jay more than you saw, if I recollect right.  I was just going to close, without mentioning to you a Matter that will want yr. Influence-perhaps to make the Propriety of it quite manifest. We are about to live together on the following Plan. Col. Pickering & Lady consent to take the Trouble of us upon our paying the extra Rent of a larger House than what they have, whenever we can find one, furnishing each one his own Chamber, and depending on him to charge us the most moderate Board in his Power. He is making Purchases at his Leisure for us so as to take every Advantage. Neither he or we doubt but the same we pay now will fully suffice and have twenty times more Comfort & Reputation annexed to it. But if it does not We cannot go on as at present you must see that it is a Situation most inconvenient, improper and even dangerous. We know not before when we are to convene from one Meal to another. A Frenchman may bring two or three Ship Captains with him to Breakfast or dinner, a Rakish Speculator may have his Like at Supper when both Danger & Indecency may mix, or a young Blood of an Officer may whip down his Dinner, and then rise and whistle or sing across the Room till we have done; and all then together may be cursing daily the dining-Time of Congress.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia. July 24th. 1780. You will herewith receive the Votes & Laws of this State passed during the last Sitting of the General Assembly, which are transmitted thro' me by the President and Supreme Executive Council to you.(1) It is wished that the Votes & Laws of each State could be sent thro' the like Channel to the other States; this would conduce to a uniformity of proceedings and to the ease & improvement [of] legislation throughout the United States.  The public duty I am obliged to perform is too much for me, and as our State affords me no relief in Congress I shall be obliged to decline the Delegation. The truth is, should my health & strength hold out, my finances will not; while I continue in the station I will support the Rank of a Deputy of the State, and this I find so expensive in these times that without some support from the Government I cannot endure it much longer. I have not received a farthing since the first of January 1779, and I am not a single day out of Congress unless when attending some court of Justice, so that I cannot attend in the least to my private affairs, nor to the wants of my family; however I will endeavor to persevere until the General Assembly meet again, especially as the difficulties & dangers we have had to encounter, owing to our change of system for the support of the war by taxes & loans, are not yet over. For God's sake exert yourself in enforcing the collection & payment of the public taxes, or we may yet be ruined; if we had but money we could finish the war in all probability the present campaign, notwithstanding the loss of South Carolina.  A fleet of eight sail of the Line, besides several frigates & armed transports, with 5,000 troops on board, are safely arrived at Rhode Island from France, sent for our assistance by our great and good Ally, whom God protect. This fleet is superior to that under Admirals Graves & Arbuthnot, notwithstanding what you may have seen or heard to the [con]trary. Be that as it may, believe me we shall be vastly superior to the Enemy on this Continent very soon. Keep this  JULY 25, 1780  hint to yourself, as you love your Country; verbum sat sapienti.(2) The Tories will propagate, and, I will suppose, do believe the contrary; I hope they will gain credit for a time. Notwithstanding the resardue domi,(3) and appearances abroad you see I have some consolation in being a member of Congress; and if I had not now and then these grateful animating cordials yet I [will] not quit the Helm in the midst of a storm.  I cannot conclude without informing you, that Delaware at present stands high in the Opinion of Congress, and that if they had revised and altered the tender law, and adopted the plan of discharging the national debt of the 18th of March last (for which omissions they are alone censured) they would have stood higher than any State in the Union.  Please to present my compliments to Chief Justice Killen, & your Brother. I am, dear Sir, Your most obedient humble servant,  Tho M:Kean P.S. When you see Mr. Dickinson, be so kind as to remember me affectionately to him.  ""

I have received of Mr McCarty the money you drew for, which Shall be Sent by a Safe hand in a Short time. Should it be in my power to render that Gentleman Any Service in the affair you mention be assured I Shall do it with pleasure.  We have official Accounts of the Arival of the french fleet at Rhode Island, on the 10th Instant Eight Ships of the line and Several frigates with 5000 land forces. I wish we were ready for Co operation. Reinforcements Come in very Slowly, every State greatly deficient in their Quotas of men, much therefore must depend upon the Militia of the New England, New York, Jersey, and Pensylvania States. We are told by the Delegates from those States, that men will not be wanting. I wish it may turn out so. Our Magnanimous Ally is making most noble Exertions in our favour, and it will be degrading indeed Should we fail in doing our part. The want of money is very Embarrassing, and unless the Treasury is Speedily Supplyed, it will be very difficult to put our army in motion, and keep up the necessary  JULY 25, 1780  Supplies of provisions. Of the one million two hundred and odd thousand Dollrs. required of Maryland, 200,000 only has been Sent in, And the other States are equally Deficient. So that you will readily guess at the State of the Continental Treasury. There has been lately an embarkation of Troops at New York, and a fleet of Several Ships of War, and other Vessels, to the Amount of Sixty one or two, Sailed from the Hook Wednesday last, Steering as far as they Could be Seen, about a South East Course. Various are the Conjectures respecting their destination, some are of opinion they are gone to the West Indias, to reinforce Admiral Rodney, who it is reported has lately met with a Severe drubing from the Combined fleets, haveing lost four Ships in the engagement, a 74 Sunk and three taken, and the rest drove into St Lucia, Some in a Shatered Condition. Others are of opinion (and I think with greater probability) that their object is Rhode Island. Their Superiority at Sea, and the number of Troops they may Spare from New York for so Short an Expedition, may induce them to attempt Something before the french fleet and Army Can be reinforced.

  Dear Sir Philadela. July 25. 1780. I had the honour of your Excellys. favour by the last post.(1) All the influence that I have shall be exerted in favour of the Gentleman recommended in your Letter, tho at present I see very little prospect of an appointment of that sort taking place, if it should you may rely that my attention shall not be wanting.  The Acts of the General Assembly have been received, and we shall have it in our power in a few Days to send one half of them by Mr. Laurens to Europe. The remainder we shall forward by some other opportunity.(2)  The English Fleet sailed from New York on Wednesday last at 4 oClock in the afternoon; the whole consisted of sixty sail. Among them was twenty one ships of War, of what force the intelligence does not say. Light Troops it is said are on board; what Number is very doubtful. The conjectures respecting their destination are very various. One is, and it comes from New York, that an action has taken place in the West Indies in which the English have lost one 74 sunk in the Action and three of lesser force taken, and that the remainder of the Fleet is blocked up in St. Lucia and that this Fleet has sailed to their assistance. A Nother report is that they have sailed for Rhode Island, but both can be only conjecture.  JULY 25, 1780  The French Fleet consists of eight sail of the line, three Frigates and two bomb ketches commanded by Mr. Terney. The Land forces amount to five thousand; fifteen hundred of them are at present unfit for Duty but will be able in three weeks to join their Regiments.  Mr. J. Adams in his Letter of 23 March observes that the Committee and other public meetings in England are likely to give Administration much trouble.3 He speaks of a Congress among them and hopes they will soon have the powers of one. He is not particular on this subject. He dwels much on the late vote in the House of Commons abolishing the board of Trade as to America, which is a tacit declaration of the Sense of the Nation and is so received by the World, that America is lost forever. There was a Majority of eight on the vote, for the affirmative.  Give my Compts. to Mrs. Lee and believe me to be with Sincerity & the most perfect Attachment, Yrs. J. Henry.  ""

You JULY 25, 1780  observe it had been long since you had recd a line from me before, but make a generous excuse for me, your Self.  You will give me leave to assure You Sir, Nothing, except being personally with friends, could equal the Satisfaction I feel upon receiving letters from my friends, when at a distance, and Consequently proportionably happy in addressing them.  And altho I have been obliged, from Sheer necessity, to neglect addressing my friends when my inclination urged to the performance, Yet I have wrote a number of letters to them on various occasions, some of which were upon interesting Subjects-And which from the Rect. thereof not having been acknowledged, and other circumstances render it more than probable, have took a different rout from what was intended perhaps where they may have Given information to those That it had been better for us, they had remained in Ignorance. This Circumstance has prevented my making Such observations to my friends that other wise I should.  Last winter I did my self the honr. of addressing you upon the Subject of having a Post Office in Exeter(1) in which I inclosed a Certificate from the Post master General, That he had given Mr. Hazzard positive orders to Establish a Post office there and to appoint Mr Joseph Gilman Postmaster And to direct the post rider to take his rout accordingly. But to my no Small Surprise Am inform'd by Mr. Emery, that no Such Circumstance had taken place. I could wish for a hint from you respecting this Matter-as any Quibling objections-Hazzard may be promp[te]d to raise ought not, nor will they avail, he has no business to think in the matter, much less to Speak- and only one line from you I will take up the Matter in a most decisive manner, and perhaps in a manner that will Convince Hazzard that he has no business to become a party in the affair.(2)  I also wrote you 2 long letters, in the month of March, upon various interesting Subjects And at the Same time wrote Col Bartlett but from a letter I Just recd from him of an old date doubt whether they had been recd.(3)  I was very happy on seeing Mr. Emery. And what added Greatly to my Satisfaction upon the occasion was the very full information he gave of the Spirited Exertions of my fellow Citizens, that they Stand first upon the List, for striving to save their Country.  Mr. Emery is appointed by the Quarter Master Genl. and Commisry Genl. to receive all Supplies from that State &c.(4) I must beg leave to refer you to that Gent. for particular information-he will stand in need of money to enable him faithfully to discharge that Trust.  The fatigue incident to a faithfull discharge of my duty, incessant reflections on the Embarrassed Situation of our public affairs, hath Considerably injured my health, But hope when the rays of prosperity Shall have brightened a little more, I can afford a degree of relaxation Sufficient to remeddy the Evil.   My most Sincere regards to the Gentlemen of the Committee of Safety.

  Dear General. Philadelphia, July 25, 1780. Your favor of the 18th instant, came to hand yesterday. I thank you for your paper and send you one in exchange. Captain Gobbie I have not yet found, but shall apply at the Board of War for information respecting the most expeditious mode of forwarding his letters.  The tories in Carolina have had a gentle currying:(1) Thank God for small mercies. I hope this is but a trifling prelude to some adagio that is to come. I speak in musical terms to a musical man. The French force at Rhode Island consists of eight ships of the line. Five thousand troops, two bomb catches, and three frigates. General Washington to be honored and obeyed by the French army as a marshal of France: the American troops always to have the right and our officers holding commissions of equal rank and date with them to take command. These are marks of great attention. Our new levies are very tardy in their operations. Why are they not sent forward? JULY 25, 1780  Something important must be done this campaign or shame and disgrace will be our portion. Admiral Greaves sailed for New York a few days ago with all the naval force he could collect, amounting to about twenty sail. 'Tis said he is destined for the West Indies for the relief of Rodney's fleet which has been soundly drubbed by the Count De Guichin who has sunk one of their 74 gun ships and taken 3 more; the balance blocked up at St. Laria [Lucia]. All this by spies &c. from New York. Observe I tell it to you on no other authority. By some 'tis conjectured that Greaves is gone to take a peep at Admiral Tourney, if so I hope he may be made to pay for peeping.  General Wayne made an unsuccessful attempt to storm a blockhouse of the enemy's at Bergen a few days ago. The attack was made with the utmost gallantry and the place would probably have been carried, but no entrance could be found, there being no other but a subterraneous one. Our loss was sixty odd killed and wounded, in exchange for which he got some hundreds of bullocks. As much as we want beef this is but a bad exchange. This is all the news I can recollect and some of this will perhaps be more particularly related in the newspaper, which I have not yet read. When do you set out on your Southern expedition?  Success and happiness attend you when and wheresoever you go. Adieu, my dear friend, Jn. Walker  MS not found; reprinted from Thomas Balch, ed.,Papers Relating Chiefly to the Maryland Line During the Revolution (Philadelphia: Printed for the Seventy-Six Society, 1857), pp. 113-14.  1 Walker is undoubtedly referring to the defeat of a force of loyalists at Ramsour's Mill, N.C., on June 20, 1780.

  Sir, Philadelphia July the 28 1780 Its with a high Degree of Satisfaction, I consider your appointment to the command of the Southern department. The gloom thrown JULY 28, 1780  over our affairs in that quarter, by the heavy losses we Sustained in Charlestown, must give way to the consideration, of having an officer called forth to the general direction; whose zeal and abilities are competent, to the management of the most hazardous matters. Whilst I congratulate my country on the Principle, I wish you with great ardency Success in the Event, and as it will be the business of Congress to afford you all necessary and possible Support I must consider it as an indispensible Duty on me, from a knowledge of the Department you are engaged in, to give you Every information, that may be useful in the attainment of your object.  A Decided turn in the affairs of Georgia hath long since Characterized the Inhabitants, the various misfortunes and calamities which they underwent, have confirmed their principles. Their habit is Republican and their constitution or form of government is perfectly moulded in that frame. The form gave umbrage to Some persons in the State, and the Decisive laws they Enacted against the friends of the king of Great Britain, who were Inhabitants, and compelled to Retire, hurt their feelings, the Republican interest however preserved and still continues to preserve, the full Weight of power, and with it an indelible attachment to freedom & independence- an attachment which they have Exhibited under many instances of Signal distress, and Sealed with their blood and indeed, can any thing afford higher testimony of their principles, than that of maintaing government in the back parts of the State, at this time-a Situation which Exposes them on every Side to the attack of either the Savages or British troops.  The Honorable Stephen Heard on whom the powers of goverment are Devolved in my absence, as being President of the council, is a Gentleman of great zeal and integrity. Every information you may be desirous of Receiving from him will be just, his knowledge of those who may be trusted, will be useful. I would Recommend a close correspondence with him, and the deliberations of the council to your attention. There are officers, who have greatly distinguished themselves in the partizan line. Col. John Twiggs, you will find to be an intrepid, Judicious, faithful officer-his Representations, and knowledge of the Country will be just and advantageous. Col. Ben. Few, Cols. Dooly & Clark, the Captains Inman's--these are all tried & brave men and have no doubt, but they will acquit themselves with honour in Every Service, your orders may Require. I have had a long Experience of their usefulness. Augusta is a station where a tolerable force may keep in awe the disaffected in South Carolina, and form a place of Resort for all the well affected, but of this, you, Sir, will be the best, and only Judge.  Thus far I have taken the liberty to observe. Permit me now to Sollicit your attention to the Georgians in General, with a firm persuasion that the bravery, and Publick Spirit which they have hitherto   displayed will Receive peculiar lustre, from its being Exerted under the Auspices of a General; who is characterized as a friend to the Rights of Mankind; and particularly those of North America.  Captain Watson a Gentleman, who has suffered much in the Service of his country, and by whom, I forward Some Dispatches to the president of Georgia will have the honor of handing you this letter. He proposes Some stay at Camp. I must request the favor of your advice to him in proceeding to Georgia, and should you have any Commands that way, he will Execute them.

  July 29, 1780] Your letter ... was this day read in Congress containing your determination not to act in the Quartermaster's department;(1) some warmth appeared on the occasion. For my own part, I must confess it would have given me pleasure if you could have reconciled yourself so far as to have superintended the department until the end of the present campaign, as you would thereby kept out of the power of your enemies, at least so far as to prevent their tantalizing over you, to the great mortification of your friends, of which you have a number in Congress who I believe are unanimous in opinion that your resignation at this time is attended with many delicate circumstances. When I pay the greatest deference to your wisdom and prudence, I cannot but believe it is in the power of Congress to hurt your feelings more sensibly than they yet have done, which I am ready to believe some of them would be happy in showing an instance of, and that soon. Your letter is committed; the committee are Mr. Ward, McKean, and Henry, from Maryland. I suppose they will report on Monday next;(2) the measures that will be taken I will not undertake to say, but I expect debate will run high.  I wrote you a letter sometime since.(3) I fear it is mislaid, as I have no answer. I cannot take my leave of you without saying that I never approved of the plan as adopted by Congress for regulating the Quartermaster's department. My greatest objection was, that many of the salaries were, as I thought, insufficient, and by that means the public would suffer for want of men of ability to act in the several departments, which I expected they would soon be sensible of; and had you continued, Congress must have taken all that blame to themselves, which by the steps you have taken they will endeavor to lay at your door with too much success. I hope I may be mistaken. I  JULY 29, 1780  suppose there is not a set of men on earth more fond of charging their blunders to other people's fault than we are. As I conceive the great clamor against the staff departments to be first raised in order to charge the depreciation of the currency to their account by the Board of Treasury and by them spread like other infections.

  In Committee of Congress, Paramus Sir July 30th. 1780, 3 OClock in the morning Previous to our letter of the 28th Inst. to General Greene, Copy whereof we have the honor to inclose No. 1,(1) The Commander in Chief, came to our quarters and informed us the Enemys movements had rendered it necessary that he should Change his position and approach Hudsons River-That he had ordered the army to march at three on Saturday morning-That as the Quarter Master General, had Intimated his intentions to Congress, and the Committee, that he would not continue the direction of the department under the New system, every species of embarrassment would arise and a scene of confusion and distress be produced, which in all probability would be Irremediable, and therefor entreated the Committee to apply a remedy, If in their power; A circumstance so painful, and which might produce such serious and distressing consequences, called for our immediate attention; nor was it easy to determine in such a line of conduct as would not involve the honor of Congress, (to which we are Incapable of being indifferent) on one hand, and avoid on the other evils beyond what the Generals delicacy would permit him to state to us, and to which the public were so evidently exposed. We concluded after having maturely considered the matter, under the extensive view of all the probable consequences which would flow from a deprivation of a directing head in a Department on which the very operation of the Army depended, that a personal conference with General Greene, might be productive of happy effects; We accordingly had a conversation with him, the result of which was; that he would continue to direct the business untill congress could be advised with, by us, provided we should signify what is substantially contained in the Letter No. 1. We accordingly addressed the letter to which We received an answer of which No. 2 is a Copy.(2) Alarmed at the short period stated by General Greene, as that beyond which, he would not continue to Act; considering what was proper to be done on this occasion, we concluded to desire General Greene to take back his letter, and to request a declaration on his part, that he would continue to serve until the pleasure of Congress should be known. We determined on this with the express view, that if he consented to make the alterations agreable to our wish, we would submit to Congress, whether combining every consideration, It might not be adviseable for Congress to withhold an answer on the subject as stated in our letter No 1, Inclosed, and to let the business Slide on under the orders of the General, countenanced by the Committee, in order to superceed the necessity of repeating an act so recently JULY 30, 1780  passed and the objections to which, were likely to produce a change of Officers and a consequent variety of embarrassment in a most Critical moment. Impressed with the necessity of this measure as the only one which afforded a probable prospect of bringing this business to any tolerable conclusion, we last evening met General Greene and proposed the alteration, he replied, In substance \""that such an alteration was totally Inadmissable-that if even he should continue to Act, Colo. Cox and Mr. Pettit would not-That others would also resign-That without the two former especially, he could not efficiently prosecute the business of the department, already involved in almost insurmountable difficulties, from the want of money and the Jealousies which were entertained in regard to the Officers of the Department-That nothing less than a repeal of the act of the 15th Inst., and a power lodged in the Commander in Chief, in the Committee, or in both conjointly to regulate the department as circumstances should require, and a request on the part of Congress, to Colo. Cox & Mr. Pettit, to re-assume their employments, could again put the business in train and induce a continuance of his and their services, in this line-That he required no pecuniary reward beyond his necessary expences; nor did Colo. Cox make it an object, but Mr. Pettits circumstances would not admit of his Serving the public without an adequate compensation.\"" Thus Sir, have we stated the transactions on this business and Congress are now fully possessed of all the facts relative to it, and in their deliberations on the subject will doubtless contrast two great objects, their dignity, and the public Weal, in the present critical situation of our affairs, and come to such conclusions as shall appear to them most proper, at the same time we will beg leave to observe That in whatever point of view we consider our present situation, distress in the extreame presents itself. Intelligence has been received (not yet indeed authenticated, but bearing strongly the semblance of truth, that its veracity is little doubted,) That the Enemy are gone in force to Rhode Island, this will probably oblige the General to cross the Hudsons River, and impell him with his little Army to movements tending to draw back the enemys attention. These movements may point at New York, but they can merely point for which more can be done, with an Army when that department on which so much reliance in operations must be placed, is on the point of being totally dissolved, an Army scantly supplied with provisions and other necessaries to which the means of transportation is not afforded-the forage required not furnished, and the Officers still acting in the Quarter Masters Department without money to provide either. Indeed Sir, we are arrived at a dreadful period, and nothing now seems capable of extricating us from ruin, but decisive and spirited measure by Congress in some cases, and a temporising conduct in others, when times, exigencies & conjunctures rendered it indispensible.  Aware Sir, of the delicacy of giving an opinion on a subject w[h]ere  the feelings of Congress are so evidently concerned, Nothing could induce us to it, but the clearest conviction, founded on the most minute observation, and meeting with the Concurrance with the Commander in Chief, that a change of Officers in the Quarter Master Genls. Department, in this stage of the Campaign, and under the embarrassments of our affairs, must be absolutely productive of ruin; under these circumstances we conceive that to be silent would be criminal; and therefore must take the freedom of recommending a suspension of the New system for the Quarter Masters Departmt., as pressing exigencies have arisen which render it necessary for the present, and to empower the Commander in Chief, to arrange the Department, in such a manner as to adapt it to the present Circumstances of our affairs.  We have just now received a letter from Genl. Greene, of which the enclosed No. 3 is a Copy, We have had the subject under consideration before, and took measures to procure forage, it seems without affect.(3)  We wish Congress to interfere with as much dispatch as the business evidently requires. We have had the honor in the course of this month, to address Congress, on matters of the first moment to the Weal of these States, a want of adequate information from them, is extreemly distressing. We therefore intreat their Determination on the most capital articles, as on this, which most certainly does not admit of any delay.

  Dear Sir Philadela. Aug. 1. 1780 Your two letters addressed to the Delegates were laid before Congress and that respecting the Situation of the Maryland line referred to the board of War, and the other to the Admiralty.(1) It is much to be lamented that the States of Virgina. and N. Carolina have not or cannot furnish provisions for the Troops that are sent for their protection. The State of the army under Genl. Washington and the objects in view will leave us little room to afford them any assistance from this quarter, indeed if we had the provisions it would be impossible to transport them in the present exhausted State of our Treasury. It is with pain that I reflect, that Congress or some one who shall derive his authority from them, must soon exert the same powers here, that the Maryland line has else where; without it, I firmly believe it will be impossible to prosecute the present Campaign with vigour and success; and where this will end God only knows.  I am however in hopes that the distresses of the Southern Army will cease on the arrival of General Gates, who has joined them before this Time. He has full powers to appoint the- necessary Staff officers and to take every other measure for the protection of that Country. His influence and Authority I trust will enable him speedily and fully to relieve the wants of the Army. From this State or even from Maryland it would be impossible to supply them; the expence would be insupportable.  What ever is the result of the deliberations of the Board of War shall forthwith be communicated to you, which will probably be in the course of a few Days.  It gives me pain to hear of the losses sustained by our merchants, and still more when I reflect it is out of our power to afford them protection. I have never lost sight of the former application, and therefore I did not urge a report from the admiralty, knowing that if one was made, it could not be in our favour.(2) I expected on the arrival of the French Fleet, that their Force would be so considerable and superior to that of the Enemy, that we should be left at liberty to employ our own frigates to the protection of our Trade; but that we know is not at present the case; the Minister a few days ago urged Congress to send forward the remnant of our little Fleet to join the French squadron and to fullfil our engagements in this respect, which the Honour and Faith of Congress readily induced them to comply with. It is not impossible but our ally may have a decided superiority on our coasts, when that is the case, we shall urge Congress to a permanent resolve for assigning part of our Frigates to the protection of the Trade of our Bay. At present it is impossible to grant the aid requested consistantly with our Faith and engagements to the Min- AUGUST 1, 1780  ister of France. When the letters were read yesterday, Congress manifested the Strongest desire to comply with the request of the State and I believe would have unanimously done it had it been in their power. If the conjuncture of affairs should put it in our power to urge the Matter with propriety our endeavour shall not be wanting.  You are not uninformed that the number of our Fleet is reduced to four or five Frigates and one of them in Europe and another (the Confederacy) in this harbour, and where from the reduced State of our finances she has been obliged to lay. She will however soon be at Sea.  The British Fleet is off the harbour of Rhode Island and they manifest an Intention of sending land forces up the sound from NewYork; should this be the case G. Washington has taken the necessary Measures to give them all the aid in his power.  Walsingham has joined Admiral Rodney in the West Indies, and both Fleets are at Sea; the combined Fleets it is supposed are destined for Jamaica.  You have not been kind enough to answer my two former private letters.(3) I should be always very happy to hear from you, and to receive such information as you may think proper to communicate; Your letter read yesterday in Congress respecting the Flour gave great pleasure.  Give my Compliments to Mrs. Lee and such of the Ladies as hold me in remembrance and believe me to be with the most perfect Attachment, your Excellency[s] friend and hble. Servt.  J. Henry. Junr.  ""

  Dear sir. Philadelphia 1st Augt 1780. Had I at any time since my arrival here been possessed of a scrap of good News I should have attempted to allay your hungring & thirsting. In the 31 days which I have been sauntering away about the City & Congress Chamber, I have heard nothing pleasing to the mind, seen nothing but melancholy accomplishments of the last Year's predictions, such circumstances as I could wish to communicate in a shady retreat, but cannot venture to display upon Paper. The Body Politic is sick, Sick indeed! The Servants of the House are more & more riotous & unless relief be immediately administred by wise exertions of the better branches of the family a dissolution or violent convulsion will infallibly be the consequence. What a picture  AUGUST 1, 1780  is this, & yet believe me my Dear Sir it is not too highly coloured. What an unhappy Man must he be who is entring upon service in such a family. When at some times I have taken up the Pen intending to pay my respects to my worthy friend at Chantilly a damp Cloud has overspread me & I have laid the Pen down again. The last Post Morning, maugre all reluctance, I had determined to acknowledge the rect. of your obliging Letter of 10th Ulto.(1) Govr Rutledge came in & demanded my attendance in a conversation respecting the recovery of our Southern States. The subject was Interesting & detained me till the hour for writing was past, I confess, I felt a kind of gladness from being provided with so good an excuse & I almost wish for as good a one in the present moment, but I altogether wish for the assistance of your self & some other Men of abilities in our great Council. We have at present as far as I am able to pronounce, an honest composition but chiefly made up of new hands, who from a want of knowledge of things past are more liable to err in judgement by confining their views to the appearance of the thing immediately before them, instances in point have frequently occurred within my 30 days experience. This is an Evil, but perhaps not the greatest. The Wheels of the Machine are clogged, the proper means for renewing their motion are wanting & every State & every Man is praying to Jupiter, he has provided them with Shoulders & will work no miracles for such Lubbers. This Pen strikes to add, we have no Money, no Credit on this side & are running fast, not wantonly, in debt on the other, but I will restrain it.  The French Fleet under Monsr. de Ternay is blocked up at Rhode Island by a superior squadron commanded by Admirals Graves & Arburthnot who now lie between that first & an expected second division & we are told Sir Henry Clinton is embarking 9000 Troops in the So. and intending an attack upon our Allies on the Island. The Cheval. L (2) assures me the 2d division is competent to defence, I wish it may be so. Messrs. Ternay & Rochambeau hold themselves to be secure from Insult, American Troops are gathering fast, to join them.  The Commander in Chief has in this critical Moment transmitted to those Officers his definitive plan of operations, says, the Die is cast & he rests upon the States for saving our Arms from dishonor & disgrace by making the necessary provisions. He is not responsible on this point.  The Quarter Master General at a most critical period has signified an inclination to resign, this Morning will probably produce an acceptance but not without traits of displeasure.(3) The present conduct of that Gentleman seems to give much dissatisfaction within doors- what can have tempted him to treat Congress with sneer & sarcasm? He applies to them the odious epithet, Administration, & is so fond of the conceit as to repeat & reiterate his wit.  The General Officers in the same unlucky moment remonstrate  for means which shall enable them to dress & keep Tables upon a par with Officers of their Rank in the Army of our Ally-a friend of yours says Aye! the demand is reasonable-a Warrant moreover should be Issued for furnishing them with equipages, good breeding & education equally with the French Nobility, said Officers, \""to be accountable.\"" These are cursed troublesome affairs in a cursed troublesome conjuncture of knotty points. Majr. General Mcdougal I am told is waiting an answer,(4) but we have not yet determined that Congress shall be enabled to live in splendor equal to that of the Minister of France, nor that the American Minister at Versailles shall cut as superb a figure as the Venetian Ambassador. 'Tis to be hoped the General Officers will not insist upon taking by force the right hand of fellowship. What shall we conclude of the designs of Gentlemen who demand what they know cannot be granted. O Virtue! O Patriotism! whither are ye fled!  Undoubtedly Mr. Lovel has written to you respecting Mr. A Lee & Mr. Izard, therefore I shall say nothing.  The Laws lately enacted in your State appear all to be salutary & I hope the good views of the Legisture will be fully accomplished;(5) I think it most probable, the Men raised in Virginia will be destined for Southern service, a Committee will report on that head tomorrow, after all, the want of Money & the want of virtue which comprehends the want of every Thing, presents to my mind an unfavorable prospect. Governor Rutledge attends the Committee alluded to & will proceed to the Army under General Gates when the business in hand is completed.  I have been waiting here upwards of three Weeks in perfect readiness for embarkation, Congress having Resolved that it is highly necessary I should proceed to Holland; I am not of their opinion but will nevertheless go whenever their Lordships of the Admiralty shall have equiped a Little Packet Boat which Mr. Laurens would have turned his back upon, the business might have been done in three days, but say they, we want Money, we want we want the wheels are cloged. Possibly I may be called upon to morrow perhaps not these ten days, the suspense is painful, & if my presence is at all wanted yonder, the delay must be extremely detrimental to the Public Interest.(6)  Inclosed with this you will recieve two of Dunlap's Papers to which I beg leave to refer. I also beg you to present my best compliments to Mrs. Lee & the families at Chantilly & Menokin, should I go from hence without paying my duty to Colo. F. Lee I will certainly allow large Interest in transmissions from Europe. With every good wish & with the Highest Esteem & Regard I conclude, My Dear Sir, Your affectionate & Obedient, humble servant, Henry Laurens  ""

  My dear Sir Philadelphia Augt 3d 1780.  I receivd your favor of the 13th of July by Yesterdays Post. On my Journey I met Mr Gerry at Hartford, where we were unexpectedly engagd in publick Business with Governor Trumbull.(1) I utterly forgot that I had your Letter to him, but since you have empowerd me to open it, I find, it wd have been of no Advantage to you to have deliverd it to him there. I waited upon the only Gentleman of the Committee of Commerce now in Town,(2) who told me your Account was not settled.(3) I urgd it, and will continue to do so as a Matter which ought not to be delayd. When this is done, I will pursue the Step which you request.  I do not like the Situations of the two Fleets. The English appears to be the superior, and while they lie before R Island, they may serve two great Purposes, the intercepting the 2d Division from France, and the giving their Cork Fleet an Opportunity of arriving at N.

  Dear General Philada. 3d August 1780.  I cannot pass so favourable an opportunity of answering your kind AUGUST 3, 1780  letter as that of Coll Johnston (1) altho' an interview wou'd much better Serve to disclose or unburthen the mind which cannot so properly be done by Pen & ink.  Your Soldiers Shirts are by this time I hope gone forward, with Overalls, and as much dispatch in procuring Shoes as can well be made. As you are now to have but a few hints, the great concern of an Empty Treasury with a thousand daily demands, forms the front line of my highest fears & deepest distress. We want at this moment to draw money, produce, transportation &c. from these States to whom we are already deeply indebted, and whom our delinquency in payment disenables from advancing those Taxes whereon at present we depend. How the Scheme of business & Finance contained in the resolution of the 18th of March last will operate for our relief is yet uncertain but doubted by too many, for altho' it is considered by many good judges to be at once just & wise respecting the publick at large, yet various individuals suppose themselves injured or disappointed by fixing the money at forty to One, and therefore decry the measure. Mr. Laurens by our reverse of fortune in South Carolina has been retarded in his voiage to Holand for which place he sets out from hence in a few days for the purpose of borrowing money for the United States. Mr. Sarel (2) was Set out (before yr. letter came to hand) for Holland also, in order to procure Cloathing for the Pennsylvania line of our Army, with Some other necessaries for the State, which if he is Successful, I hope may be of some use to us. Genl. Greens peremtory resignation in the business of Qr. M. Gl. or refusal to act under the new regulation for that Departmt. at this very critical moment, has at once disappointed and thrown Congress into a degree of vexatious distress, greater than can well be expressed, or has yet happened, in regard of any individual, nine tenths of the difficulty arises from the importance of the present moment. The Committee of Congress at Camp appears to make Genl. Greens continuance of absolute necessity-so that if he is retained, the measures of Congress for reforming that department must be recinded, & the Censures of the publick must remain agst. Congress, as deaf to their remonstrances for the reformation of abuses. The remonstrance of the Genl. Officers was this morning read & Committed to a respectable Committee,(3) the greater part whereof wil1 in my Opinion meet the Cordial attention of Congress who are as well disposed to do anything in their power that is in itself right, as men can be.  The controversy betwixt you & Genl. Hand gives some pain to all your friends that I have heard speak of it, as tending to derange many things now established & introduce a new field of dispute which cou'd not be well Settled again.(4) These and Sundry such Sentiments prevail at the Board of War, whom it is said are possessed of written Opinions of high Authority which clearly conclude agst. the utillity, if not also agst. the right of your claim; for they will not allow that  the resolution of Congress for securing the rank of Prisoners, extends to your case, or at least that this is doubtful. That the first appointment of Genl. Officers being wholly with Congress, belongs not to the ordinary line of rank secured by the resolution to which we have alluded. I cou'd, especially with the consent of my Colleagues bring this matter before Congress, but whether brought on in this way, or by a plain & dispassionate memorial from yr. Self, the immediate consequence wou'd be a reference to the Board of War, and from thence (as far as I can learn) to the Commander in Chief & a Board of Officers at Camp. I have thought it necessary to write you thus plainly, having Strong apprehensions that if carried to the uttermost, it will ultimately go agst. you. I therefore wish you cou'd either reconcile it to your Self from what you may have learned of the Sense of others, to give it up, or to write me Soon, that it may be brought to a period. Be assured that Sentiments from Camp, and also Sentiments formed here promise no Success to yr. claim in the present question. I hope you will judge right-and am most Sincerely Yours, John Armstrong  4th. The present State of Our Southern department is very forbiding. The letters of Genl. Gates & Baron DeCalb, draw the picture of universal want, more particularly in the Articles of money & provisions. Genl. Green having So peremtorily refused the necessary Service, is likely to be discharged from all other-today must end this disagreeable matter. I beg you will present my best wishes to the Gentn. of Our line. I intend this by Coll Johnstone, together with a conference before he Set out. J.A.  ""

A vigorous offensive Campaign in Conjunction with our generous Ally is intended, and little or no money in the Treasury to Carry on its operations, this may retard, but Still I trust we Shall be Enabled to get Along. A million of Dollars is Coming on from Massachusetts, and I hope the other States will be forwarding theirs.

  Sir, Head Quarters Peekskill Augt 6. 1780 By a private letter I this day received from a Member of Congress, (1) I am informed that a report of a Committee then lay before Congress, in which it is recommended to accept the Quarter Master Generals resignation.(2) Convinced from long experience that the decisions of Congress are not very rapid, tho on matters of the last importance, I am induced to address myself to you on this subject, hoping it may reach you before the final decision of this business.  Although alone (necessarily so by Mr. Peabody's indisposition and absence at Morris Town, and General Schuylers call to Albany on his private business) yet I conceive it my duty to give every information to Congress where, in my opinion, the interest of the United States, is intimately concerned. That it is so in the present case, must be evident to every unprejudiced man, who will take the trouble to think a little. The late movement of the Enemy towards Rhode Island, rendered it necessary for our army to move. How could this have been effected, without the immediate, and particular superintendence of the Officers of the Quarter Master Generals department? Circumstances have rendered it necessary for this Army again to take post in the Jerseys. The same question again arises-But allowing that on the resignation of the head of this Department, another Officer was ready to step into his place, is it reasonable, is it consistant with Common-sense, to suppose that in a Department so complex, so diffuse as this is, a man can be found capable of acquiring a competent knowledge of the business in a days time (for there is not a day, in the present situation of affairs, but it is indispensibly necessary) so as to be enabled to discharge this great trust, either with honor to himself, or to the interest of these states. I believe human genius is incapable of such an exertion. It may be said, it is not the whole Department that is meant to be displaced, but only the head of it, and there are other Offices now in it, well acquainted with the business, some one of whom, may be induced to take it up, and go on  AUGUST 6, 1780  with it. But I think I can with some degree of confidence assert, that for the same reasons the present Quarter Master General offers to quit it, no other officer now in it, capable of the trust, will accept it; on the contrary, no other reason induces such to continue in it; but a continuance of the head of the Department; Add to this, the apparent suspension of the system of the 15th Ult. [let it be remembered that in this department, is included the forage, the Waggon, and the artificers] annihilate it, and I would be glad to know, how your Army is to march one mile? Without a head a body is an useless trunk. That this whole department must be thrown into the most irreclaimable confusion (I mean for this Campaign) and rendered totally useless for the remainder of it, should Congress either accept the resignation of the present head of it, or persist in its being conducted under the system of the 15th Ult, I will undertake to pronounce with the most decisive confidence. It may be asked, whether Congress are to be dictated to, by their Officers? I answer without hesitation, that on the present occasion they must; necessity compel them to it, and it is a duty they owe their constituents, not to suffer punctilio, to militate against their essential interests. If there are men in the great council of this nation, capable of such a conduct-I will not say what I think are their deserts. I have mentioned that displacing the Officers in the Quarter Masters Department at this time; must militate against the welfare and interests of these states-as thus-The Eyes not only of our Country, but of all Europe are turned on America, and impatiently wait the Issue of the present Campaign. The consequence resulting from its being a successfull one, on the contrary, every member fit to hold a seat in Congress, may easily enough determine, from the flattering expectations held up to this country, of rendering the present-With the divine support-a decisive Campaign. The states have been called on to make very extraordinary exertions. Almost all of them have gone great lengths, and are still pursuing the most vigorous measures, to attain this very desirable end. Some of them under considerable disadvantages, so much so, as will greatly debilitate them, and render their future exertions extreemly difficult. Under these circumstances, suppose our army was to be arrested, at the place of their next encampment, and not be in a capacity to move from thence, during the remainder of the Campaign, for the want of proper Officers to put it in motion? (That this will be the case appears to me beyond a doubt, if it is to depend on a new sett of Officers). How then, are the people of this country, to be recompenced for the extraordinary burthens they have subjected themselves to? Who will undertake to satisfy their discontent, the natural result of so grevious a disappointment, and caused by so impolitic a measure? Thus it evidently appears to me, Sir, that an adoption of the Report I have alluded to, will produce a total derangement of this Department, consequently put an end to the Campaign-render us  in the Eyes of all the world more contemptable than any people that ever existed. And we shall be branded with the epithet of mere pretenders to the blessings of liberty: But, Mr. President, permit me to call the attention of Congress to another consideration. Remember the Gentlemen at the head of your Army-much is due to him. Remember the sacrifices he has made of his domestic ease and felicity, and is daily making of his private interest in the service of his Country in one of the most laborious stations, that almost any man ever encountered with the fortitude and success that he has hitherto done, whose extraordinary merits require not my pen to enumerate. For Gods Sake! have some regard to his feelings; and do not reduce him to the sad dilemma, which this step must inevitably do, and oblige him at once to relinquish every hope of rendering the least service to his country. This would be cruelty to him, and injustice to America.  I have Sir, with freedom written my sentiments, on this subject, such as becomes me as a member of Congress, and a man who feels the Welfare of his Country far dearer to him than every other consideration in life. My present situation enables me to take a more comprehensive view of this business, than it is possible for other Members of Congress to do, confined as they are to a single spot removed at the distance of One hundred & fifty miles from the Army, therefore more competent to give proper information on the subject.  I have done my duty to my Country-Congress will judge for themselves, and let future events determine the fitness or unfitness of their decision.(3)  I have the honor to be, With the highest Respect, Your Excellency's Most Obt. Humble Servant, Jno. Mathews  ""

 Isaac Motte to William Drayton Dear Sir,(1) Philadelphia 6 Augt. 1780. Since the Surrender of Chas. Town, I bent my course towards this Place & arrived here the 1st of last month. I shall remain here for some months to come-till I can fix upon a Plan so as to get my Family to me. I fortunately escaped being made a Prisoner but was obliged to leave Mrs. Motte & our little ones behind, not having it in my power to bring them off with me. They are with Mrs. Brough- AUGUST 6, 1780  ton, my Mother in Law, and were well last month. I have suffered exceedingly in this Contest, having lost the greatest part of my Estate, but I hope 'ere long to be in a way of providing for my Family-at present I am much reduced.  Your Son Jacob is hearty & well, he is with his Uncle Stephen at Williamsburgh in Virginia. They were as lucky as myself in not being made Prisoners. Your Brother is fond of him and has taken him under his protection. He is now very able to assist him, having had a very lucrative Place for some time past.  My Brother Jacob and all my Relations (except Mr. Dart) who is here, are Prisoners.  I wrote to you some Months ago, if you cou'd possibly make it convenient to yourself, that you wou'd oblige me very much, to pay into the hands of Mr. John Nutt, Mercht. in London, the amount of an Order I drew on him, when I was in England last (say in Octr. 1774) in favour of Luke Kendall. I think it was for £250 Sterlg. & the Interest due thereon.  This Money was lodged in Mr. Nutt's hands for the use of my Brother in Law-Billy Smith and I was under the necessity of making use of it before I cou'd leave London, having been disappointed in Remittances from home. You will oblige me very much, if you'll settle this matter for me and take a special rect.  I know the Young Gentleman must want the Money and I have no other way of paying him, but thro' you. If you shou'd see him, please give my affectt. Love to him and tell him, that I've received but one Letter from him since I came to America. Let him know his Sister & other Relations were well, when I heard last from that Country  I must request of you to give me leave to draw on you for the Balance of your Note to me. The Principal is near five hundred pounds Sterling & six Years & Upwards Interest due on it. As this is the greatest dependence I have for my present support, I hope you will accommodate me, if you can. Was I not circumstanced as I am, you wod never have heard from me on that subject, but I'm now really in want of it. I have another favor to ask of you and which I am sure you will not take amiss-it is to make some Memorandum with respect to yr. Note. You must know 'tis out of date and in case of accidents, 'tis necessary to do something to make it valid. Excuse all this trouble & be assured it gives me great pain to be under the necessity of giving it to you. My situation is very different to what is was a few Years ago. I have much to say to you, but prudence tells me to be silent at present. Shou'd you meet with Mr. John Clampson Mercht. in London (he formerly lived with Mr. Rd. Shubrick) I shod. be obliged to you, to inquire of him, if he has received any more Money on my Acct. from Richd. Grubb's Estate & how much & acquaint me therewith, that I may draw for it.  I hope you're happily settled with your young Folks and have ob-  tained a Place so as to make you live comfortably the remainder of your days. I shall be very happy to hear from you, so let me beg of you to embrace the first opportunity that offers. Please direct for me to the care of The Honble. Henry Laurens at Amsterdam & he will forward the Letters to me. I must now conclude with my most Afectte. Love & many good wishes to yourself & the Young folks and am, Dear Sir, your very affectte. Friend, Isaac Motte  P.S. Pray give my love to Mrs. Temple when you [have] an opportunity. I have wrote several Letters to her since her Marriage but have not received any in answer to them. I suppose she has long since heard of the death of her Father.  RC. (ScU: South Carolinian Library) 1 William Drayton (1732-90), who had been Chief Justice of East Florida until 1777, was Motte's brother-in-law and a cousin of former delegate William Henry Drayton.

Nathaniel Peabody to Josiah Bartlett Dear Sir, Morristown, Augt. 6th. 1780. I have been lately favoured with your letter of the 13th May last,(1) (it went to Philada. and I found it on its Journey back to the Eastward) acknowledging my letters of the 8th of Feby., and 17th of March last. Since which I have wrote you two very long letters,(2) respecting various subjects; in one I inform'd you of my being unexpectedly appointed one of a Committe to a most disagreable, Arduous service, And requested you to Continue to write me as often as possible, And promised in return, to give a line as frequent as my Circumstances would by any means permit.  And you will readily Judge, that the business assigned the Committe has been more than sufficient to occupy the Greatest mind, And engross the whole Attention. It has not been for want of true and real regard, to you, and many others, that I have not wrote much oftener. For some time past, I have Scarce wrote once a month to my family.  I Cannot omit observing the manner in which your letter is concluded, You Say, \""I am without quitting old friends for New\"" &c, which mode of expression being to me New, I am entirely at a loss what Ideas were meant thereby to be Conveyed-for I Never intimated, or even had a Single thought that you had so done. But if it is meant to imply a Charge, I am Still in more than threefold darkness about the matter, as I am totally ignorant which part of my Conduct could warrant the suggestion, more especially with respect to You,   Sir, in particular. However it is now time to begin my letter. I have been in Camp from the latter end of April last, till since Mr. Emery retur'd home, (3) during which time the Army underwent Several Changes; They know what it is to want, but Not to abound.  I have seen them inviron'd in almost every Species of distress. Though things begin to look a little more favourable. The Army increases fast, and a tolerable prospect, all Circumstances Considered, of Supplies. But I am not without Great Anxiety for the Event of this Campaign. There are many contingencies on which the fate depends.  Beside which there are, generally found, men in the Councils of every Nation, And People, who find means under some plausible pretext or other, to render the best Concerted plans Abortive. Can we suppose the councils of America more virtuous, or, her plaans less vulnerable than those of other Nations?  Whenever anything decisive, And important is set on foot; designing mell will always find out a Diana, or some other favourite Goddess, in danger, And under her banners, with Great Zeal, Alarm even the honest and well meaning among the Citizens, and excite them violently to appose the Measure. Such envious Zeal, and Malevolent practices, ensure to the authors great Confidence and applause, not only from the devotees to the invaded Goddess, but many well meaning Citizens who Suffer themselves to be led blindfold- by their Machinations! This my friend is a Lamentation, And Shall be had for a Lamentation!  Johnsons Golden shrines, may have made proselites to his Master.(4) Who knows the power of Gold? You, and I, my friend, have not had the Chance of knowing by Diabolical experience-if we had, I will Venture to assert, it would not have influenced us in the manner, I have but too much reason to believe it has some others-in whose power it is to do us much harm.  America has it in her power speedily to put an End to this Cruel, & bloody War. If it is not done, ought there not to be an enquiry who has been the means of procrastinating, the happy hour of peace & Independence?  I once read of a people, who were at times led by a Cloud; And I have known of a people whose Grand Multiform'd Sanhedrin, were often times in the midst of a Fog.  You will Judge how dissimilar their Situations. I see a Fog, or Cloud, rising with afire in the midst, which, if not soon dispeld, and extinquished, Will in all probability greatly distress the Army, if not totally mar the proposed operations of this Campaign!  The only object we can now have in view, must be to raise and Establish an Army, for the War.  Which must be done upon a permanent basis. The terms must be both honourable, and profitable.  Can we expect men any longer to encounter every species of hardship, and danger, to fight our battles, without a prospect of some other reward, than Cold, hunger, poverty, and disgrace?  The raising of men by draft, or otherwise, for short terms has been found burthensome to the Citizen, And ruinous to the Army.  We have always two Armies to feed, and pay. Vast numbers Continually Comming, and Going; which Sad experience has taught us, Serves only to take off the honest husbandman from improving his farm, Lessen the Produce of the Earth; Exhaust Your Treasury; Destroy your Army; Waste your ammunition; Expend the magazines of provision; Greatly increase the Necessity, but diminish, the Means, of Transportation.  In Short it deranges every System, and renders Calculations altogether uncertain.  Upon this Mode of proceeding, You Can Never have an Army in the field, by any means, proportionable to the Expence, or adequate to the indispensable demand of the Service.  For all this enormous toil and expence, What have we in return? A few raw undisciplin'd troops raised for a short period; by the time they are inured to a Camp life, And with great fatigue, to the offices, and expence to the united States, a little disciplin'd, and become in a degree martialists, Capable of rendering Service, the terms for which they were inlisted expire!  The Army derives but very little aditional Strength from such recruits .  Such aid must nevertheless be Sometimes Call'd forth, in Cases of urgent Necessity, but as auxiliaries only. They must not be too much depended on.  The Cause deserves other means for Support. America has it in her power to furnish those means.  The exigencies of the time, renders it indispensable. For was it possible, in the nature of things, that our Cause could be a little longer Supported in this way, without hazarding the loss of our Allies; The increase of our Enemies; And Missing the Golden opportunity for Establishing our Independence. The resources of the Country would be incompetent for the purpose. The mines of Peru would Scarce Supply your Treasury. The Community Could not long indure it.  Can we, upon rational Grounds, expect to pursue the War with Vigour, And Success, or to Negociate a peace to advantage, while in our present Labyrinth?  Our enemies, foreign and domestic, fully Comprehend our situation. They know where we are vulnerable, and where Not. Can we expect New friends will rise up to our Support?  Let us but have an army in the field, upon a proper establishment, Such as the nature and importance of the Service Absolutely de-  mand-And America fully capable to furnish-And my life on the issue, Such decisive measures being pursued on our part, other Nations Convinced we are determined to be free, will step forth to our Aid, and Check the Careers of our Enimies; which will Compel them within, and without, at home, and abroad, instantly to relinquish all pretentions of Conquest-And to Sue for peace, almost on our own Terms.  The whole dependence of our Enemy, for Success, has not for a long time been on the real weakness of America, but upon ruining our finances, which is well nigh Completed, And on our not having an Army, properly established in the field.  It might not be improper to observe in this place, that the usual Calculations in all Armies, are, that a much Greater proportion of men die by sickness within the first four months of their entering a Camp life, than for four Years after that term is expired.  It might also be observed, that the usual disparity in pay, given to persons who turn out for a Short time, And to the regular Troops, Cannot fail to impress the most disagreable Ideas among those who are engaged during the War.  But why should I trouble you thus much, with my thoughts upon a matter with which you are So fully acquainted, especially, as I am sure your knowledge of public affairs, and daily Observation, must suggest to your mind Ideas more adequate to the subject in question. If I have been unguarded in expressing my Sentiments, Your Candour will impute it to Zeal, and not to a want of rectitude of intention.  I cannot Conclude, without mentioning the high sense I entertain of the honor and merit due to that State, for its decisive and Spirited exertions, at this Critical, and Alarming Juncture-it is confess'd by many that not another State in the Union, has a Claim to higher, if there is one, to equal merit, with the State of New Hampr. upon this occasion.  It is, at present, my fix'd determination, that nothing but a want of health shall prevent my coming home in all September. I have been in this place about a week, in hopes that a little relaxation from business, may aid in restoring me to a tolerable State of health. At present, my Situation is rather unfavourable. In addition to the pulmonic Complaint I formerly had, behold a hectic grins me full in the face, And tho. my pale front, at this time, is less brazen, than usual, Yet I am fully determind to parry the insults, and baffle the assaults of that Grim Tyrant.  You will please to make my best Complements to Mrs. Bartlett, And to the President, And Gentlemen of the Council of Safety.  I am Dear Sit, with Great truth, your Sincere friend, most obedient and very Humble Servt, Nathl Peabody  ""

  Dear Sir Philadelphia Augt. 7th 1780 I am much obliged to you for your favour of the 1st Instant. Your information respecting the Spirited Conduct of our State, gives me the highest Satisfaction, and hope to have the pleasure of seeing our new raised Battalion on their way to Camp in a short time.  Wednesday the 26th General Clinton with the principal part of his Army embarked, and proceeded up the East River as far as Huntington Bay, on an Expedition Against Rhode Island. General Washington with his Army Crossed the north River to Peekskill the 29th, and Joined our Troops there, with intention as he says, in his letter to Congress of the 3d instant, to have Attacked New York, had the Enemy proceeded to Rhode Island-in Consequence of this move Sir Harry thought proper to return the 31st. General Washington informs, that he should recross the North River with his Army, the 4th, and proceed to Dobbs's ferry. This he says he is induced to do, to save the forrage in the neighbourhood of Peekskill, as they have occasion for it some time hence. The Enemies Sudden return I think pretty Clearly evinces their Weakness-that they have not men Enough to attack Rhode Island, and leave at the same time a Sufficient Garrison at New York, for the defence of that place. The British fleet lyes off Newport, and tho Superior to the french, has attempted nothing-perhaps their design in staying there is to intercept the 2d Division of the french fleet. The New England Militia it is Said are Comeing in fast, those of this State are under Marching orders, and the militia of this Town are to March Thursday next, the whole to be Commanded by President Reed. From present Appearances our Army will in a Short time be very formidable, And if nothing happens to prevent a Juncture of the intended reinforcement of the french fleet at Rhode Island, it may be reasonably hoped, that the Issue of the present Campaign will be glorious for the united States of America; nothing will prevent it, but the want of money- little or none in the Continental Treasury, and the States pay in very Slow indeed. (1)  I Sent 1700 Dollars by Mr. Redgate inclosed in a letter to you and directed to the Care of Mr Al. Contee mercht. in Baltimore which I hope you have received. My Compliments to your Father and the Ladies. And hope Mrs Carroll will Succeed to the Utmost of her Wishes in the laudable Business She is at present engaged in.

  Dear sir Philadelphia Augt 7th [1780] Your packet directed to the Delegates was delivered by Mr Green Who also delivered us a Letter respecting the money to be emitted to which due attention will be paid and every assistance given to Mr Green in our power. (1) I think there is but little Chance of Selling the Tobacco here to any advantage, Tobacco delivered here Sells very high, but no purchasers that I can hear of Yet, that will take it anywhere Else.  I have the pleasure to inform you that Congress yesterday received a letter from General Washington dated the 3d Instant Acquainting that General Clinton had proceeded With the principal part of his Army, as far up the East River, as Huntington Bay, on an Expedition against Rhode Island, but that he had returned Again. Immediately on Clintons embarkation, General Washington Crossed the north River with his Army, with intention if the Enemy proceeded to Rhode Island, to Attack New York but as Sir Harry had thought proper to return General Washington Writes that he Should recross the north River with his army the 4th and proceed to Dobbs's ferry, and this he says he is induced to do, to Save Forage in the neighbourhood of Peekskill Which he may be in want of Sometime hence. The Sudden return of the Enemy I think Clearly evinces, their weakness. That they have not men Enough to send to Rhode Island, and at the Same time leave a Sufficient Garrison at New York for the Defense of that place. The Enemies fleet are Still lying off Rhode Island And tho Superior to the french they have attempted nothing. Perhaps their Continuing there may be with design to intercept the 2d Division of the french fleet. From present Appearances our Army will in a short time be very formidable, and Should nothing happen to prevent A Junction of the intended reinforcement of the french fleet at Rhode Island, the Issue of the present Campaign will I think be most glorious for America. Nothing will in all human probability prevent it but  AUGUST 7, 1780  the want of money. The Continental Treasury is Exausted, And the States pay in very Slow indeed. The press begins upon our part of the new money tomorrow, So that you may expect to have it Shortly.

  Dear Sr. [August 7? 1780](1) Your Letter to Col. Harrison turns out as I expected before I AUGUST 7, 1780  received your full information.(2) If the whole had been read and attended to it was impossible to put any other construction on your manner of treating the Subject than to convince your correspondent of the absolute necessity of great exertions this Campaign, while we had a promising prospect before us, least by remissness and delay we should find our ally as well as ourselves embarrassed with greater difficulties than at present, and I very sincerely wish, should this Summer pass away without some signal advantage gained on our part we may not find your conjectures verified in event. I have my hopes we shall yet be able to do something important upon the arrival of the French reinforcement as I presume their Fleet will then command the Water without which I confess I have no sanguine expectations. With the command of the Water the enterprise may be successfull. Mr. Bingham has recd. a Letter from Martinique informing him the combined Fleets fell to Leeward on the 5th July supposed for Jamaica thirty three or thirty six ships of the line and 12000 Troops. They expected a reinforcement of a few thousand Troops more. If this account be true it is probable Jamaica will fall and that we may have them along our Coast. You are desired by some late resolutions to turn your thoughts towards the recovery of S. Carolina & Georgia as soon as the operations of the Campaign in this quarter have been executed. Gates's and De Kalbs Letters represent the distresses of the Southern department in a very gloomy light as to provisions and equipment. The Virga Recruits when raised are ordered to join that army-if this interferes with your plans you should let us know it as they will not be ready to march untill the begining of next month. The Law past by the Legislature will probably bring into the Field about 3000. A Colonel or Major Pinkney of South Carolina writes Col. Motte a Delegate of that State that the Enemy are not more than 2500 strong at their Posts in the Country exclusive of Horse of which they have a strong Corps and about 800 or 1000 men in Charles Town-of our 2500 Militia not above 1500 had reached Hillsborough in N. Carolina but Mr. D Jameson of the Virga. privy Council writes us that many of the Deserters had been taken up and sent forward to Hillsborough. Caswell had abt. 1200 Militia under him. Baylors and Blands Dragoons nearly equipt so that if they can get provisions sufficient and forage wch. by this time it is probable they are furnished with they will be in condition to face the Enemy and I hope drive them into the Town.  We have been greatly perplexed the last Week with General Greenes refusal to act in the office of Quarter Master General unless the New System was totally repealed and he was allowed to conduct it under your direction in such manner as he thought most conducive to the public Service besides Congress were to request Pettit & Coxe to resume their Offices. If Genl. Greene thought the New System wanted amendment and had pointed out the defect Congress wod.  AUGUST 8, 1780  have considered the matter and I Doubt not wod. have made the necessary alteration. But the manner of these demands made in such peremptory terms-at the moment of action when the Campaign was opened, the Enemy in the Field and our ally waiting for Cooperation has lessened Genl. Greene not only in the Opinion of Congress but I think of the Public-and I question whether it will terminate with the acceptance of his refusal only. On Saturday Col. Pickering was appointed to the Office of Quarter Master General with the Rank of Colonel & the pay and Rations of a Brigadier General and to hold his place at the Board of War without pay or right to act while in the office of Quarter Master General. This Gentlemens Integrity, Ability and attention to Business will I hope not only prevent the evils to be apprehended from a change in so important a Department at this time but will I hope be able to reform some of the abuses crept into that Business and lessen the amazing expenditures of the Department. He must if he accepts have a disagreeable office in the present State of our Finance but we must support him all we can. The promotion I lately mentioned has not taken place though if we take up the Business I suppose it will be done as M.(3) is the oldest Colonel and Gates is the only Major General belonging to Virga. and the State has a right to two but I see no occasion of stiring in it at present as if taken up it must be upon the general principle of promotion and then not only Virga. but Maryland and other States will expect to partake of the same privilege of bringing forward their officers-when I believe there are few States whose lines are so full as to justify the promotions.

  Sir Philadelphia August 8th. 1780.  I had the honour to receive your Excellencys letter, of the 22nd Ulto., by yesterdays post. I immediately, communicated the contents, AUGUST 8, 1780  to Congress. It was refered to the Board of Treasury, for them to consider, and report what, could be done, As they are supposed, to be masters, of our Finances. I shall do every thing in my power, to obtain a spedy determination.(1) And as soon as obtaind I shall loose no time, in transmiting the same to you. It is with concern I inform you, I have it not in my power, to give you any encouragement, that you will receive any releif from Congress. I can only add they have it not in their power, to grant releif on any one application for money, let the sum be ever so small.  I mentioned to you some time since, that general Greene, had declined serving as Q M General, which was accepted after near a weeks altercation. And Colo. Pickering, was appointed to that place, with the rank of Colo., and pay of Brigd. General.  I have been alarmed for Several days past, by a prevailing report, that Sr. Harry Clinton was gone to Rhode Island, with a formidable land force, to attack that place. The alarm hath now ceased. General Washington informed us yesterday, that Sr. Harry with the Troops under his Command, had returned to N. York; after waiting several days, in Huntington Bay.(2)  I have nothing further to acquaint you with worthy of your notice. Congress has not passed any Resolutions, of any considerable consequence except that respecting the QM Genl, since I wrote you last. To enter into a detail, of all the difficulties and embaresments, that attend all our publick measures for want of Money, would only Serve to hurt your feelings. A line from your Excellency at every convenient oppertunity would be gratefully acknowledged by him who hath the Honour to be your Excellencys most obedient and most Humbl Servant, Ezekiel Cornell  P.S. Since writing the above, an Express hath arived from General Gates, in North Carolina. The accounts from that quarter, are not so favourable as I could wish. The want of money, is equally the same there as here. The want of Provisions is extreamly great in the southern Army, even to that degree that they are with out either Flesh or Bread, living on Vigetables. We are endeavouring to fix, on ways and means, to make more Ample provision, for their suport. I fear you will think I delight, in informing you of only the gloomy, side of our publick affairs. I assure you I should be exceeding happy if truth would justify a different language. The Enemy by the best accounts are in full possession of South-Carolina, and Georgia, with a small part of N. Carolina, beyond Pedee River. Congress is endeavouring to put the Army under General Gates in a situation to be able to confine them to the limits the Genl shall fix. E. Cornell ""

  Sir, Camp near Clarks town Augt. 8, 1780 I inclose you copy of a letter I received late the last evening from the commissary general.(1)  As the State of Pensylvania must be depended on for the article of flour, and as all communications to that State must now come from Congress, I conceive it indispensibly necessary to give the earliest information, that measures may be taken to prevent another fasting in the Army. Its increase by men unaccustomed to hardships, promises us little hopes, that in its present state, the distresses they lately experienced will be now borne with the same fortitude and resignation, which they then were.  Congress will observe by Mr. Blaine's letter, that the magazine at Trenton is empty. This was the only one the Army had to rely on, and I was in hopes it would have been regularly and amply supplied, from that source which Congress have been frequently told was our great dependance. I could not however give up my hopes, that the flour had been forwarded, and if not at Trenton, it must be at Easton: But on inquiry of Mr Blaine, he informs me he is certain there is none at that place, if there was, he must have known it immediately. Therefore the small quantity in Sussex county, being all the flour the commissary General can at this time command is a circumstance truly alarming.

The direction of these depended, not on the General, but on fortune, which in utter contempt of all human opinion, Ever was, & ever will be the great arbiter of human things.  As the arrangements you made for the order of a [. . .] were conducted by wisdom & knowledge, and your Situation Subjected a retreat to much hazard & Peril in the opinion of the general officers, Men of Candor &Justice will approve of your conduct; at the Same time, that they lament, the fatal defection of so considerable a part of the troops under your command, as the militia then were. A defection, which, at a moment So critical to the glory and Safety of their country, has covered them with disgrace and defeat.  However, I am persuaded your Constancy will not give way, and I trust to the Exertions of your well known abilities, to conduct on Some future day, our unexperienc'd militia to both victory and honor.

  [August 14, 1780](I) I am sorry to hear that none of the new Bills sent from hence (meaning to Connecticut) are issued; it is of the last importance that they issue immediately; Congress have already drawn upon the Loan Office in Massachusetts for a Sum in those Bills: this must be our dependence, as other Sources fail, and considerable Sums of Money are now wanted. 1 wish every State would make a vigorous Exertion to bring in their whole Quotas of the old Bills by one Tax-all the States except Delaware and N Carolina have adopted the measure, the Quota for Maryland is now printing.  We had a Letter yesterday from Mr Jay dated May 26th-no Treaty was then concluded, he has had several Conferences with the Prime Minister on the Subject, (2) who treated him very politely- enquired critically into our civil and military Establishments, the Numbers and wealth of the Country, the Revenues for carrying on the War, what assistance we could afford to Spain therein, and how  AUGUST 14, 1780  we might be otherwise advantageous to her, if a Treaty should take Place-to which he returnd Answers. Mr Jay likewise acquainted the Minister that Congress had drawn bills on him, to the amount of £100,000 Sterling, with the motives, to which he answerd that it was difficult for that Court to provide at this Time for the Payment of them, as they have been obliged to take Money on Loan to carry on the War-but on the whole gave Encouragement for the Payment of Part of the Money, and providing such Security for the remainder as will prevent the Bills being protested: but there is no Encouragement for a further Loan.

  Dear Sr. Philadelphia August 15th. 1780. I had the pleasure to receive your favour, of the 9th Instant yesterday. I am sensible of the difficultys, the Army labour under, for want of proper supplys, in the QM. Genl department. But I fear a greater difficulty, if possible is near at hand, I mean a general fast through the Army, and that for want of a Supply of provision. That matter now under consideration of a Committee of which I am one,(1) we meet this morning at eight o'Clock, I fear the difficultys are of so stubbern a nature, as to baffle all our efforts. They arise from a complication of Blunders, as well as unforeseen accidents.  I think you have now nearly adopted the opinion, I was of, when at Moristown, concerning publick life. And the more I see, of publick life the more I despise it. The Zeal I shew against adopting the New plan, for regulating the Q.M.G. department, caused the Majority of Congress to treat me with great Coolness, for a considerable time. It hath now intirely subsided, I am now treated with the greatest politeness, and enjoy as great a share of their Confidence, as I can expect, Which leads me to beleive they are sorry they have carryed the matter so far, but their pride will not permit them to retract. I can say no more than that it hath appeared to me from the first, that some thought it necessary to sacrifice, one for the Salvation of the whole, But upon the whole it is my opinion some particular piques, and predujucies excepted, Congress that is every Member, wish well to their Country. But their being so many members and so many different sentiments and to that may be added want of ablity or general knowledge & in attention to business, that it cannot be wondered at, if difficultys arise in carrying on our publick affairs. By the inclosed letter,(2) you will be informed the Committee are recalled. It is there mentioned as a necessary measure. I believe it to be so, to keep harmony among our selves. Some members were against their appointment, they have never failed to blow the Coal on all Occasions. The Committee have at some times wrote plainly to us, and  AUGUST 15, 1780  pressed our difficultys Close upon us, which is another matter many of us cannot Bear, altho founded on the greatest truths, For my own part I se nothing to charge the Committee with in point of Conduct, some of their letters, were in a stile rather warm but that I imputed to Schylers Zeal and the Warm Climate of Matthews Nativity. Congress were not so angry at the Memorial of the General officers as you imagined, We are not apt to be angry at any thing we can evade. The memorial wase Committed to five members of Congress to consider & report upon, which hath been done, but in such a manner, If I may be allowed to judge from the little knowledge I have of the sentiments of the Army, As to give little or no Satisfaction.(3) These letters are wrote intirely in confidence. My Complimints if you please to Harry Knox and tell him there is a report that his Honour & your self posses[s] the Most uneasy disposition of any two general officers in the Army. Much hath been lately said about some letters that certain Gentlemen wrote to Congress when they Sett at York Town.(4)  I am dear Genl with every Sentiment of Esteem your most obedient and most Hum Servant.

He hath the vanity, to think he hath both the Confidence and respect of congress as much as tho he represented a state much larger. At the same time I have a particular pleasure, to find the state have passed, a law, for funding the money ordered to be emited, by a Resolution of the 18th March.(2) As it was the only means, that appeared to be left to Supply the want of money (and of the most AUGUST 15, 1780  pressing Nature) for Carrying on the Opperations, of the present Campaign. But Still I fear one difficulty, will attend the facilitating this Business, that is I fear the Board of Treasury are greatly in arear, in striking the New Money, for the several States that have sent their Acts of Assembly to Congress, And that Occasioned by some of the reasons I have mentioned in some of my former letters.  In my last I mentioned communicating your letter of the 22 Ulto. to Congress and that it was refered to the Treasury Board,(3) upon receiving your letter of the 25th I pressed the Matter. Congress have this day come to a Resolution, directing the President to send a Letter to the state, agreable to the form fixed by them.(4) It is very polite & expressive of the highest Satisfaction, in the Exertions the State hath at all times made in this Contest, Promising payment for any Sums the State may advance to the staff department. It is but a Cold way of advancing money, but you may rest asured it was all Congress could do, and much more than they would do for Som States. All circumstances Considered I hope the state will make themselves as easy as possible.  The President of Congress lately receivd a letter, from the Count De Roshambeau,(5) it was exceeding polite, and its contents must do the heart of every American good, that had the pleasure to hear it read, but more especially if he belonged, to the States of Massachusetts or Rhode Island, as he appeared to be much pleased with the Conduct of the Militia, that came to his Assistance, and bestowed on them the highest ecomiums, And appeared to be perfectly secure In Newport, from Any visit Mr Clinton might please to make. The Minister at this place, appears much pleased with the Counts representations to him. I hope the people of Rhode Island, are as much predujuced in favour of the french gentlemen, at that place, as I am with the Minister here. I must Confess If I ever was predujuced against the french, it is all at an end; As I think it must be with every American, who hath the honour to be acquainted with the Minister, if he can be allowed a true Frenchman. To se his polite unaffected easy manner of adress, The kindness and abundance of good nature, with which he treats all ranks and orders of men, his excessive fondness for Americans as Allies, To which may be added the ease and comfort every one enjoys, that hath the honour to dine at his Table, free from every kind of cerimony, or fomality, Every one left to eat and drink as he pleaseth, stay as long as he pleaseth, and go away when he pleaseth, I want word to express, And shall [not] intrude on your patience.  The president receivd yesterday a large packet from Mr. Jay, dated Madrid May the 21st 1780.(6) There was no publick news. Its chief contents were the Ideas and politicks of that Court upon the wole. I think it may be considered rather favourable towards these states. Particulars I am not authorised to Mention.   For publick news I must beg liberty to refer you to the inclosed papers.

Our embarrassments are great, and exceedingly distressing, and the State of our finances is Such as would require the abillities of a Necker to put it into proper order, yet I hope by the assisstance of the new Bills, Certificates, and Sale of Bills, we Shall be able to Keep the Army together.

  Dear Sir Philadela. Aug. 15th. 1780.  A letter was yesterday received from Mr. Jay dated the 23d of May AUGUST 15, 1780  at Madrid.(1) He has had several communications with the Spanish Minister, but has never been received in his public character. Many important questions has been put to him; such as the Number of regular Troops, the manner of arming, paying, cloathing and feeding them. The Constitution of Congress and the several States, the Debt of each of them, the continental Loans and emissions &c &c &c. The Court seems to have acted towards him with great caution. Money they inform him might have been had last year, but now there own expences are so great as to lay them under the necessity of borrowing themselves. From the Complexion of the whole letter I believe they will not suffer the Bills that have already been drawn on Mr. Jay to return protested. This is a happy circumstance and I hope when they fully understand our necessities they will not withhold further support. The navigation of the Mississippi for a considerable distance up it is a great object with them and should we agree to give it up to their sole use and jurisdiction, together with a guaranttee for their other Dominions in its neighbourhood we might almost demand with a certainty of success any thing in their power to grant. You will remember that I am at present writing from information and not from my own knowledge of this letter. I was not present in Congress owing to my indisposition, when it was read. I shall inform my self of its contents, and will give you satisfactory extracts by the next post. Our Countryman Mr. Carmichael was well.  Our Army is increasing fast and men in abundance I believe may be had if we can support them: upon this head I have the most alarming fears. Col Blain writes that he has but a weeks provision before hand and no flour at Trenton where a considerable quantity was expected.  The militia from this City will march to day. The Holker and Fair American has put into this port a packet from England bound to N. York; she had on board a number of officers who are now in this City.  My Compliments to Mrs. Lee and believe me to be with sincerity and affection, Yrs. J. Henry  ""

  Dr Sir. Augst. 15th [1780]  Majr. Young could not tell me particularly any thing that you requested, but only that \""you mentioned my Name\"" and he hoped I would know for what Purpose. I imagine \""to know whether there was any News or any Letters for you.\"" Mr. Bee recd. a single one for you from the Eastward and probably when the Post came afterwards from the southwd.-as to News-We yesterday had a Narrative of 40 Sheets from Mr. Jay dated Madrid 26th of May.(1) There is a great deal of interesting matter in it. I will give you a Sketch. On Apr 27 he recd. a Letter from the comtee. of for. Affairs dated Dec. 11 inclosg. the Resolves of Nov 23 & 29 for drawing on you and him for cash. Apr 29th He wrote to the C[om]te Florida Blanca very well on the Subject, but stuck too closely to the System of the address of Sepr. last which was his own Child. The Count in AUGUST 15, 1780  Reply said He could have easily answered the Demand last year, but Spain is like Tantalus-her Revenues in America [mock her?]-it is still his Majesty's Intentions to give the Congress all the assistance in his Power-at the end of the present year or the beginning of the next it would be in his Powers to advance £25, 30 or 40,000 Stg. in the mean Time should the Bills be presented \""He would take such Measures as would satisfy the owners of them.\"" He would also endeavour to send Cloth.  As to a Treaty a long string of previous Questions were asked by the Spaniard and answered very wisely by the American. Mr. F (2) is the Stick. The King is bent upon having it to himself Jay is stiff but thinks that a media Via such as a contraband Treaty may be stipulated specially in regard to that Navigation to prepare the Way for the great Negociation of Amity. Mirailles had informed the Count that our Congress had relinquished the River and afterwards made an essential Point of it. The King had not got the Intelligence he wanted from Havannah in regard to local Circumstance which must be obtained previous to a Treaty.  N.B. I think that you may get such Information of Capt. Pickles and otherways as to be able to write a very useful Letter to J. concerning present local Circumstances in the Miss. Quarter. His conclusion is that Congress will adhere to their free navign. but that Regulations respectg. contraband articles and not inconsistant with that Idea and may be a means of closing the Business Amicably. He told the Count that many of the States were bounded by that River & were highly interested in its navigation but were willing to enter into amicable Regulations to prevent Inconveniencies in Regard to Contraband & other objects which might excite the Uneasiness of Spain.  Sir John Dalrymple appeared in Spain the 9th of April in his Way to England thro France, his wife not being able to bear the Sea from Portugal. He is endeavoring to revive a Plan of Ld. Rochforts fabricated before France was allied to America. It is for a General Confederacy between England, France, Spain & Portugal to guarantee each others Possessions: \""it is not yet too late Says Sr. John to save a million of Christians from becoming Widows & orphans\"". The most material Proviso of the Confederacy is that a War in Europe shall not be a War in America. Major Young calls.  The Spanish Minister treated Sr. John \""properly\"" and gave the strongest assurances of the King's \""Firmness\"" to Mr. Jay.  (Ministers of Holland and the northern Powers) \""I have recd. nothing more than common Civility from any of them except the Ministers of Holland & Sweeden, and indeed not much more from them. Perhaps they have been rendered more than usually cautious by an Extract of a Letter from Madrid published in the Leyden Gazette respecting Mr. Carmichael's Reception and the Attention he recd. from forgn. Ministers.\""   To the Comtee. May 27:(3) \""I have not yet had the Pleasure of hearing of Mr. Laurens's Arrival about which I am anxious.

 North Carolina Delegates to Abner Nash Dr. sr. Philada. Augt. 15 1780 I (1) arrived at this place on the 22d of June & Having no Doubt but Mr. Burke would inform you of every thing material done in Congress previous to his Departure, I deferred writing to you, from day to day, with the hope of giving you an Account of the Arrival of the French Fleet. This Fleet, consisting of eight Ships of the Line & 3 or four Frigates commanded by Monsieur Ternay, & with 5000 Land Forces, under Count Rochambaud, got into Rhode Island on the 12th July; the Minister announced this Event to Congress on the 21st, and I gave you the Intelligence, together with a State of Matters here in my Letter of the 22d(2) by favor of Capt. Stith, copy of which I now inclose. His most Christian Majesty has put these Ships & Land Forces under the Command of Genl. Washington, and directed the Officers of both to pay him all the honours due to a Marshal of France.  What I suspected proves true, Graves is superior to the French Fleet. Two or three days after his (Graves) Arrival at Sandy Hook, having obtained a Reinforcemt. of about 1000 Seamen from N. York and being joined by Arbuthnots fleet, and all the Frigates upon the N. York Station, making in the whole near 20 Sail, nine or ten of which are of the Line, he sailed for Rhode Island, intending in Conjunction with a large body of Land Forces under the Command of Genl. Clinton in person, who was to proceed thro the Sound to attack the French by Land & Sea. Clinton embarked his Troops, and proceeded as far as Huntingdon bay; but returned suddenly again to N. York. Genl. Washington havg taken Measures for reinforcing Count Rochambaud as soon as he was informed of Clintons Embarkation crossed the No. River, and advanced rapidly towards N. York, with Intention to attack it in Clinton's Absence. Whether Clintons Return AUGUST 15, 1780  was occasioned by Genl. Washington's Movements, or by contrary Winds, which delayed him so long that he had no prospect of surprising the French Commander, we know not: however it is greatly lamented that he did not persevere, for he must have failed inevitably at Rhode Island, the French being nobly supported by the New England Men, and Genl. Washington very probably would have carried N. York in his Absence. In Consequence of Clintons Return, Genl. Washington repassed the North River. Admiral Graves's Fleet lies at Anchor between Block Island and point Judith, so as to block up the French Fleet completely. The preparations for attacking New York are still going on with the greatest Vigour. Genl. Washington I conjecture has now with him near 20,000 Men, exclusive of a strong Garrison at West Pt.; the Militia of this State 3,500, march this day under the Command of their Governor; the Jersey Militia are ordered to be ready at an hours Warning, and other Reinforcements are yet to join the Army from the Eastward, all which will probably make an Army of at least 30,000 Men. Should the French Fleet be reinforced so as to give us a Superiority on the Water in time, I think N. York wil1 certainly fall; otherwise I fear it will be impracticable to reduce it; nor do I know that Genl. Washington, without this Contingent, will make the attempt. Congress have been under the greatest Difficulties ever since my arrival arising chiefly from want of Money. There is not one Shilling in the Continental Treasury. The New Money for some of the States will soon be thrown into Circulation; we hope that will relieve us. Congress appears willing to do every thing for the Support of the Southern army and the Recovery of Georgia & So. Carolina. Genl. Washington is empowered and directed to form a plan for the latter purpose, but not to interfere with the immediate Operations agt. N. York: (3) The Govr. of Virginia, is ordered to transmit a considerable [. . .] (4) and of the Military Chest. Nothing remains to be done to complete this Resolution but to fix the price of the Bills, which is to be done this Morning. Governor Rutledge I believe will take with him all the Resolutions on this Subject, and a part or the whole of the Bills of Exchange.(5)  I recd. your Letter yesterday, and immediately enquired of the Clothier Genl. respecting our Cloathing, who tells me has nothing belonging to us. I will apply to the Board of War, and do every thing necessary, if there [... ] (6) Carolina; the Vessel was chased in the Bay and obliged to run into some Creek, where the arms were put on Shore, and left we fear in very bad Condition: however a Member of the Board informed WJ. some days ago that they had taken proper Steps for recovery of the arms and transporting them to No. Carolina agreeable to Order of Congress.(7)  We had Dispatches yesterday from Mr. Jay, our Minister at the Court of Spain. Nothing decisive had been done when he wrote; but the Spanish Court appeared friendly, and seemed disposed to second   our Operations against Great Britain. We fear the Navigation of the Missisippi will prove a stumbling Block; but we hope the Difficulty will be surmounted.  The Inteligence you communicate in your Letter gives us the highest Satisfaction, as well on Account of the vigorous Exertions made by our State against the Enemy, as of the Humanity displayed in relieving our Gallant Officers and Soldiers at Charlestown.  We know your present Situation, and are sincerely sorry that you have so many Difficulties to encounter; but we trust that perseverance will in the End surmount them al1, great and numerous as they are, and we rejoice that the Genl. Assembly of No. Carolina had Wisdom to elect a Man who was equal to the important Occasion. You will oblige us exceedingly by giving us from time to time the Situation of Affairs in No. Carolina.

  Dear General: Philadelphia, August 15, 1780. The French fleet and army are still blocked up at Newport by Greaves, but in perfect security. Rochambeau heard Clinton was moving that way and applied to Heath for a few militia. They began to flock in so that in a few days they amounted to 20,000. Clinton immediately returned, but the brave Yankees could scarcely be prevailed on to go home before the land was purged of those pests to AUGUST 15, 1780  society. How contrary is the conduct of Virginia? I am ashamed of my native country and almost determined to renounce it.  Would to God the second division were here and a junction with the first formed, in that case I think New York would quake. Our army is already getting very numerous and I think any number might be raised for the siege.  The derangement of our finances-the resignation of the Quarter Master General-Shippen's trial &c. &c. perplex us beyond measure, yet I hope all will be well with us. Pickering is appointed Quarter Master General and much is expected from his diligence and fidelity.  Prizes innumerable are brought in here. Yesterday was sent up the June packet, nine weeks from Falmouth with a cargo of officers and ladies. Your old friend M'Clanahan is principal owner of all the prizes, he fits out the Enemy's vessels as he takes them and in a short time will have a formidable squadron. The Packet mounted 20 guns, and he daily expects a copper bottom mounting 26 guns from the West Indies. Well done Blair.(1)  When do you set out for the Southern Army? I hope things will soon begin to wear a better face there. Our scheme is to take New York with the fleet and army there before winter sets in, and then to send you sufficient succor to the south.  As soon as matters begin to draw towards a point at New York, I intend to visit my friends in camp and expect to see a glorious sight. I am greatly hurried and my paper out, therefore bid you adieu.

  Circular. Sir. In Committee of Congress, Tapan, August 16, 1780  Inclosed you will receive copy of a letter of the 15th Instant from the Commissary General.(1)  Circumstanced as our Army at present is, the information contained in this letter becomes truly alarming. It requires the utmost attention of the Officers, together with all the necessaries, and even comforts of life, to render the service acceptable to recruits, and as the greatest part of the Army, at present consist of that class of men, if the time should unhappily arrive when we will be reduced to the necessity of putting them on half allowance of provisions, or probably have none to give them, the consequence must be, that those men unaccustomed to endure this species of distress, and not brought to that state of discipline, which can give their Officers that controul AUGUST 16, 1780  over them, they have acquired over the old soldiers, must revolt at the Idea of tamely submitting to a service, when divested as they are of every other privilege the soldiers of all armies are entitled to, and are furnished with, they cannot receive even the means of subsistence-if reduced to the extremity I have just mentioned, and an irreconciliable disgust should once take place among these men, and desertions (or perhaps something worse) begin, the contagion, will, beyond a doubt, pervade the whole Army: For it is not to be expected that the few old soldiers now remaining will be disposed to go on enduring the calamities they have so often experienced, when they find others equally bound with themselves and who have as yet had none of those difficulties to encounter manifesting so refactory a spirit, at what, they will conceive to be, trifles compared with their own sufferings.  Should such an event take place, the train of ruinous consequences that will inevitably ensue, must at once strike you so obviously, as to render unnecessary my entering into a detail of them. We do therefore earnestly request of you, Sir, that the Officers of your state, appointed to procure and forward the supplies, may be called on, in the most urgent manner, to give their utmost attention to the important business of keeping the Army regularly supplied with your quota of the articles that has been assigned to your state. As you must plainly perceive what embarrassments the least remission on the part of the States, or any of them, must throw us into: For it must be remembered, that the monthly supplies, are no more, than what is barely necessary for the consumption of the Army in that time.  It is true that the Army does not at present amount to the numbers, on which the estimate was made, but as the men are daily coming in, we are to suppose that the compliment of men will be made up by the end of this month. But at all events it is incumbent on us, to be provided to answer the largest demands that can be made on us.  It is not only the immediate supply of the Army, that the Committee would wish to call your attention to, but likewise, the necessity there is, of the greatest punctuality in furnishing the supplies agreable to the requisitions that have been heretofore made, to prevent in future alarms, of this nature, and our giving you further trouble on the subject.

Our Accounts from that Quarter by these People & also by Land from General Gates's Army, is, that he has now upwards of Ten thousand Men with him, & has sent 5000 towards Camden & with the rest would move towards Pee Dee-there have been several smart Skirmishes between Advanced Parties. Col Sumpter on the 21 Ult. Attacked a Party at (Ansor old Court House) the upper part of Pee Dee, killed & took upwards of 50 of the Queens Rangers & dispersed 1500 disaffected Tories who were gathering in that quarter, he had not 500 men with him, some Accounts Say they have retired from Camden & that Lord Cornwallis had his Head Quarters at Moncks Corner-tis certain, by the Charles Town Paper of the 4 Augt. that, Col Turnbull who then commanded at Camden with one Regiment had been summoned by the Rebels consisting of 1,500 (as they say) to surrender. They add Turnbull, turned out & defeated them-but our Accts. say we are now in possession of Camden, which is a certain Evidence, Turnbull retreated. Our Prisoners suffer very much & Congress have done nothing for them as yet. I hope by tomorrow to Effect something,(1) great Numbers of the Prisoners had made their Escape, 120 went off in one night about a fortnight ago, & perswaded a Hessian Guard to go with them-about 14 were retaken & close Confined they all had Arms with them-& were supposed to have shot Col Tarlton, as he was wounded riding along the road by some one concealed in the woods & is dangerously wounded in the groin. A report prevailed in Town that Lord Rawdon was Killed in one of the Skirmishes back. Only 1000 Hessians remain in Town-The Small Pox & yellow fever very rife there, numbers have died already. They have broke the Capitulation in many Instances-refusing to let any of the Inhabitants dispose of any Part of their Property for their subsistance. Mr. Ferguson was turned out of his House by Lord Cornwallis-& when he sent for some of his furniture was refused it. Col Balfour now commands in the Town they have removed all the heavy Cannon from Fort Moultrie (now called Fort Arbuthnot) to New York, the Passengers in the Flagg say the Tories begin to fear an Evacuation, & although the Militia had been called on to turn out & bear Arms for the King, none had done it, many had left their homes & taken to the woods, & I make no doubt as Genl Gates marches downwards he will be joined by numbers, who formerly wished to remain at home neuters. Col. Chas. Pinckney who came off as far as No. Carolina, had gone in & surrendered himself to the Enemy, as Col Horry had done before, they both had their Parole, but were sent over to James Island, at which place & Johns Island, all the late Members of the Legislature, except the garrisons of Chas. Town & fort Moultrie were now confined to the range of the Island  AUGUST 19, 1780  only. This is all I can recollect at present, & I give it not as all authentic, but I really believe it to be so in the general. With Esteem, I remain, Dr. General, Yours Sincerely, Tho Bee  ""

 Committee at Headquarters to the States Circular. In Committee of Congress. Sir, Camp Tapan, Augt. l9th, 1780.  When America stood alone against one of the most powerful nations of the earth, the spirit of liberty seemed to annimate her sons to the noblest exertions, and each man chearfully contributed his aid in support of her dearest rights. When the hand of tyranny seemed to bear its greatest weight on this devoted country, their virtue and perseverence appeared most conspicuous, and rose superior to every difficulty. If then, such patriotism manifested itself throughout all ranks, and orders of men among us, shall it be said at this day, this early day of our enfranchisement, and independence, that America, has grown tired of being free? Let us, Sir, for a moment take a retrospective view of our then situation, and compare it with the present, and draw such deductions from the premises, as every reasonable man, or set of men, ought to do. In the early stage of this glorious revolution, we stood alone. We had neither Army, military Stores, money, or in short any of those means which were requisite to authorize a resistance. The undertaking was physically against us. But Americans abhorred the very Idea of slavery! Therefore, reposing the righteousness of their cause in the hands of the supreme disposer of all human events, they boldly ventured to defy the vengeance of a tyrant, and either preserve their freedom, inviolate to themselves, and posterity, or perish in the attempt. This was the situation, and temper of the people of this Country, in the beginning of this controversy. At this day America is in strict alliance with one of the first nations of the earth, for magnanimity, power, and wealth, and whose affairs are conducted by the ablest statesmen, with a prince at their head, who hath justly acquired the title, of the protector of the rights of mankind. A respectable fleet and Army of our ally, are already arrived among us, and a considerable reinforcement is hourly expected, which, when arrived, will give us a decided superiority in these Seas; the whole to co-operate with the force of this Country, against the common enemy. Another powerful nation (Spain) though not immediately allied with us, yet in fighting her own, she is daily  AUGUST 19, 1780  fighting the battles of America, from whence, almost every advantage is derived to us, that could be produced in a state of alliance. An Army we now have in the field, part of whom, are veterans, equal to any the oldest established nations can boast. Our Militia from a five years War, are become enured to Arms. You have at the head of your Army a General, whose abilities as a soldier, and worth as a Citizen, stand confessed, even by the enemies of his country. Our officers of all ranks, are fully equal to the duties of their respective stations. Military stores are within our reach. Our money though not so reputable as that of other nations, with proper attention, we have reason to expect, will shortly emerge from its present embarressed state, and become as useful as ever.  Now, Sir, from a comparative view of our circumstances at the beginning, and at this day, how much more eligible, how much more pleasing, and important, must the latter appear, than the former, to every dispassionate man? Then, shall we leave to future generations to say, shall we at present commit ourselves to the world to exclaim, that, when Providence had benignly put into our hands the most essential means of obtaining by one decisive blow, the inestimable prize we had been contending for, it was lost; disgracefully lost; for want of proper exertions on our part? That avarice, Luxury, and disipation, had so enervated the boasted sons of American freedom, that rather than forego their present ease, and wanton pleasures, they would tamely, cowardly submit to the loss of their Country, and their liberty, and become those abject slaves, which their generous natures, but a few, very few years before, would have revolted at the bear Idea of?  These reflections arise, Sir, from the extraordinary backwardness of some States, and great deficiencies of others, in sending the men into the field, that was required of them, near three months ago, and ought to have joined the Army fifty days past; and an apprehension that, from this torpitude, America has forgot she is contending for liberty, and independence, and the good intentions of our generous ally will be totally frustrated by our unpardonable remissness. Our former letters to the states, have been full on this very important subject, and we are concerned to be driven to the necessity of reiteration; but our duty to our Country, our respect for the reputation of the Commander in Chief of our Army, impel us to it: For a knowlege of the force that has been required of the states for the Campaign, and which was allowed to be adequate to an important enterprize, will induce a belief in our Countrymen, in the world, that it has been furnished, and they must stand amazed to see our Army inactive, and things not in that train for operation, which ought, in such a case, to be expected, especially at this advanced season of the year.  Again;-The force of our ally, now with us, and the shortly ex-  pected arrival of its second division, must clearly evince the utility of our Army's being put in a condition to undertake an enterprize which if successful, must give a deadly wound to our unrelenting and ambitious foe. But what apology can be made, if, when the Commander in Chief of our Army, should be called on by the Commander of the forces of our generous ally, and informed, he is ready to undertake with him, whatever measures he shall think proper to point out, he shall be reduced to the cruel necessity of acknowledging his inability to engage in any enterprise, that can possibly redound to the honor, or reputation of the Arms of either nation? Sir, the reflection is too humiliating to be dwelt on, without the extremest pain; nay horror!  You must pardon us, worthy Sir, for the freedom with which we have now delivered our sentiments on this truly interesting subject. We flatter ourselves, great allowances will be made for our situation, when we daily have before our eyes specimens, of that want of energy in conducting our affairs, which must shortly, so far embarrass us, as to render all future exertions inadequate to the attainment of those great purposes, at which we aim. America wants not resources we have men (independent of those necessary for domestic purposes) more than sufficient to compose an Army capable of answering our most sanguine expectations: And our Country teems with provisions of every kind necessary to support them. It requires nothing more than a proper degree of energy to bring them forth, to make us a happy people. This we trust, Sir, the state over which you preside, will shew no reluctance in contributing her aid to, by taking such decisive measures, as will, without loss of time, bring into the field, the remainder of your quota of men, that have been required for the campaign  The articles of provisions, forage, and teams, are no less important than men; but as the Committee had the honor of addressing you but a few days ago, on the subject of provisions, and the other articles, being so nearly allied with that, we will not intrude it on you, at this time.  Inclosed is copy of a letter from the Commander in Chief, of the 17th Instant to the Committee; It will fully shew you the state of the Army, at this time, and how great a deficiency of men there is, to what their ought to have been before this day. However we hope, Sir, it will be no discouragement to your state, to using their utmost exertions, for furnishing the remainder of their troops, to join the Army as soon as possible; and that the idea of its being probably too late, before a sufficient force can be collected to promise a successful Campaign, will be totally banished; for policy, as well as interest, dictate to us, to be always prepared to take advantage of every favourable conjuncture, and it is impossible to say how soon such a one will present itself.   The Generals letter treats this subject in every other respect so fully, as renders it unnecessary to add more, than that, we have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, Your Excellency's, Most Obedt.

  Dear General Philadelphia August 20th 1780 I have long wished to do my self the Honour, of writing to you. But have waited for a subject that would give you pleasure; rather than trouble you with a gloomy letter, which would only serve as an addition, to the many difficulties, that presented themselves to my view, as obstructions to the measures, necessary for you to persue, in carrying into execution the grand object, of your appointment, to the Command of the Southern Army. And when I considered your Experienced abilitys, perseveranced and Indifatigable Industry, I flattered my self the difficulties in the Souther department, would soon vanish, And the career of the Enemy be so far checked, as in a great measure, to secure the Country from their ravages. And our Ilustereous Commander in Chief, with the combined force of the Main Army, and the sea and land force, sent to our assistance by our good & faithful Ally, would before this furnished me with occurencies; not only pleasing, but of real utility, in rendering our Independancy parmanent. Altho I do not at this time realize all those flattering Ideas, I cannot but hope you will, on your part before this will reach you. And that I shall be able in my next to inform you that the Commander in chief, hath made some progress, towards the comp[l]etion of his grand object. AUGUST 20, 1780  General Washington, is encamped in the neighbourhood of Dobbs Ferry, on the West side the North River with about Fourteen Thousand men exceedingly well disciplined. President Reed is in the Neighbourhood of Trenton with 3 or 4000 Pensylvania Militia. The Count De Rosambeau and General Heath, are at Rhode Island with a Considerable force, Monsr Torneay is at the same place, with the French Squadron. And Admiral Greaves with a Superiour force, is at Anchor between Block-Island and Point-Judith.  Sr. Harry Clinton some time since, took it into his head, to make a formidable attack, on Rhod-Island, but after taking about 10,000, of his best Troops, on Board Transports and proceeding, as far as Huntington Bay, he judged more wisely of the matter, (As General Washington had put his Army in full motion to attack NYork) And returnd to the no small disappointment of the general. And the great mortification, of the French Commanders, who had made such preparations for his reception, that it would have been the hight of their ambition, to have had the honour, of giving him an entertainment. The Massachusetts, and Rhode-Island Militia, turned out with more then Usual alacrity, on this occasion And the greatest harmony subsisted, between all parties, and among all Ranks. And when the stay of the Militia was no longer necessary, they returned home, highly pleased with their new friends and Allies, who were no less pleased, with the conduct, of those they came to fight for.  Great preparations, both in raising men and furnishing supplies have been made, for the Reduction of N York. All further opperations against that object, at present depend, on the Arival of the Reinforcement, that is hourly expected from france, should a superiour Navel force arive in season, every circumstance will be as much in our favour, as we can expect if we take into Idea, the strength of a garrison strongly fortified, and defended, by a garrison of 15,000 Regular Troops, exclusive of 3 or 4000 Irregulars. General Washington, will not in my opinion, want for men or Supplies, in case the operations, are once begun in earnest. Notwithstanding the great want of Money, which hath much embarased our publick measures, and that difficulty is by no means removed. But by the smiles of Providence we enjoy the Blessing, of a plentifull Harvest, & all kinds of Provision Necessary for the Army.  Notwithstanding the aforegoing preparations, Congress have not been unmindfull of you and the Army under your Command, And many Resolutions have passed for Supplying, and makeing the department as formidable as possible, and among the rest, Bills for 100,000 dollars in Specia, have been drawn on our Minister, at the Court of Varsalis, and ordered to be forwarded, to Mr. Clay D. P. M. G. to be by him, sold to furnish the military Chest under your directions. I will not take up your time, as it is more than probable, the Resolution will reach you, before this letter.(1)   I cannot close this letter, without observing that it would be much more agreeable to me, to be in the same station I had the Honour to hold [the] last Campaign, than the One I am now honoured with.(2) Not only that I think I could do my cause more real service, and have the honour of participating with you in those difficultys that must inevitablely fall to your share, in the execution of your present important &. Critical Command. But that I might be instrumental in rendering the completion of those Honours, the more speedy, that will sooner or later fall to the share, of those possesed of abilities, Integrity and Military knowledg like yours and that gained by long experience.

  Sir, Philadelphia August 20th. 1780. Your favors of 18th June and 1st of July have reached me, and am sorry for your misfortune of foundering in a Marsh but hope you have met with no other Inconveniences on your Journey; I now write you, supposing you to be devoted to Mars, and at the head of some victorious Party warm in pursuit of their fugitive Enemies. This opinion is grounded on Intelligence recd. at this place, two days past, by a Flag of Truce in 8 Days from Charles-Town, who assert that the currt. Report of the Day at Charles Town, is, that our Army has gained very decisive Advantages in several Actions they have had with the British, and that they are retiring with all possible speed to Charles Town; if this be true, I hope the Chastisement the So. Carolinians have recd. from their new masters, will only have a tendency to make Soldiers of them, and oblige them to make that Resistance as becomes every American in the present Contest. I hope too, that our distrest Militia who have been obliged to Rescue that Country from the Dominion of Britain, will claim to themselves some Compensation for their Services, which Compensation they will sieze on, AUGUST 20, 1780  and bring home to their ruined Families; this plundering, I should not generally encourage, but in the present Instance, I think it justifiable, and wish from my heart it may be put into Execution. I observe what you say relative to the Supplies being called from Virginia, and the cause you suppose to be the occasion of such a Blunder (viz.) the Committee at Camp; this Comittee is at length dissolved, as experience convinced Congress that they daily engaged them in Quarrels with the Army, instead of correcting any of the Abuses they were intended to inspect; they brought about a Resignation of Genl. Greene as Q. M. Genl. which Resignation was accompanied with a disrespectful Letter to Congress, and was very near bringing about his total Dismission. T. Pickering is appointed to fill his place, how the Department will be conducted in future, we cannot say, but have been told by the Comittee at Camp that if Genl. Green was dismissed our Army must immediately disband. Congress have for once had Firmness enough to persist, what Evils may ensue, we cannot tell, as yet, we have experienced no uncommon one. Our Finances are much in the Situation you left them; for a few Days we have a few thousands in the Treasury, but it is as suddenly exhausted; however we are in daily expectation of the new Emissions being brot. from the Eastern States to the Treasury, how they will circulate at par with Specie when the present Continental Bills are cast at 75 for one I leave you to guess. The States have all adopted the plan, except the three Southern ones, and I suppose on the next meeting of our Assembly, they will come into it. Congress has a few Days past recd. Dispatches from Mr. Jay as late as 27th May, in which he is very particular & satisfactory; he gives us room to hope that our Draughts on him will be answered, but informs us that they will call on him to contract for Repayment in some special manner, for which purpose he calls on us for particular Instructions; he is informed by the Spanish Minister, that his Master is particularly determined with respect to the Navigation of Mississippi & wishes to limit our Western Boundary far short of that River, in this he urges special Instructions, which he is determined to act by literally. The Minister hopes it may be possible to influence his Master to grant the Navigation of the River with certain Restrictions as to contraband Articles &c. but this is matter of doubt, he informs us that no Treaty can effectually take place till these matters are more fully explained by Congress. He mentions that the Divisions that prevailed in Congress soon after he came to the Chair had reached that Court, and had tended much to lessen the Reputation of Congress, that the people of that Country are generally averse to the Americans, not believing it possible that the Roman Catholick Religion was ever tolerated in America much less placed equal to any other Sectary; but that he believed the Ministry were well attached to the Cause.  The Aid expected from France when you left us arrived at Rhode AUGUST 21, 1780  Island 12th July, consisting of 8 Ships of the Line & 4 Frigates with 5000 Men on board. A few Days after Admiral Graves arrived at N.Y. with 6 Ships of the Line, and on being joined by Adml. Arbuthnot with the Ships of War at N.Y. proceeded to block up the French Fleet in R. Island, which they have effected, and for the present, suspends the intended Operations against N.Y. However, we have daily expectations of the Arrival of a 2d Aid of ships & Men from France so as to give us a decided Superiority by Sea, should no Accident befal this Aid, we make no doubt of effecting the Reduction of N.Y. before the campaign is closed. Genl. Washington's Army at this time consists of more than 25000 Men, so that could we obtained the superiority by Sea, I believe the Business would be easily setled.  Congress has ordered the Virga. Troops as fast as completed to join the Southern Army, and we have been fortunate enough to procure Bills of Exchange for 100000 Dollars in Specie to be sent to the Aid of the Military Chest in the Southern Department, this is all we can hope for at the present; in fact they appear very averse to granting Aid to us, so that we must rely greatly on our own Resources.  Miss Hart enjoys a good share of Health, but seems much dejected since your Departure, and wishes to return home. I encourage her to persist in her Education, particularly her Musick. I believe Mrs. Burdau is rather too strict with the young Ladies is the principal reason of her uneasiness. I shall supply her occasionally with pocket Money and have her to see Mrs. Jones & Mrs. Hill frequently, as we are now become Housekeepers, finding it not so agreeable at Mrs. Jones's as we could wish. I have to solicit your Return to this place by first of Nov. or if you decline it, urge Mr. Sharpe to be here by that time, as there is an absolute necessity for my leaving this, by the 10th of that Month to return home.

I recd. two of your favours some time ago, but I delayed writing to you, in hopes that a few days would enable me to give you something very important and decisive: but it is impossible to say with precision what will be the Event of the present military Exertions in this Quarter. AUGUST 21, 1780  Portrait of Willie Jones  Genl. Washington's army including the Garrison at West point & Militia already with him, or in Motion so as to join at short Notice must at this time amount to about 30,000 Men. The french Force now at Rhode Island is 5,000 Land Forces, under Count De Rochambaud and 8 Ships of the Line under Admiral Ternay and three or four Frigates. G.W. commands the whole & the Officers are directed by his M. C. Majesty to pay him all the honours due to a Marshal of France. Admiral Graves with 10 Ships of the Line & seven or eight Frigates lies between Block Island & point Judith & completely blocks up the French Fleet. An additional French armament of Line of Battle Ships and Land forces is expected; should they arrive in time and give us a Superiority on the Water, N.York in all human probability must fall; without this Superiority I fear it will be impracticable to reduce it, nor do I know that Genl. Washington will make the attempt.  Congress have empowered and directed Genl. Washington to form a plan for recovering So. Carolina and Georgia; but so as not to interfere with the immediate Operations agt. N.York.  The Regular troops raising in Virginia are ordered to join Genl. Gates, and Congress have voted 100,000 Dollars in Specie, in Bills on France, to supply the Military Chest in the Southern Department. Governor Rutledge, I believe, will take the Bills on with him in a few days.  We have been and still are exceedingly embarrassed for Money, most or all of the States having failed to comply fully with the Money Requisitions made by Congress.The New Money is ready for some of the States and will soon be thrown into Circulation, I hope this will give us some Relief; but I tremble for the Event.  We have Intelligence from Mr. Jay our Minister at the Court of Spain. Nothing decisive was done there; but it appears that the Spanish Monarch is friendly to us & inclined to second our Operaitons agt. G. Britain.  I inclose you a paper which will give you some Idea of the Distraction prevailing in England. A London paper of June 12 came in the Falmouth packet; this paper is smuggled by some of the Tories; we are told it contains this Intelligence, that Matters had grown worse & worse, an Attempt had been made by the Mob on the Bank of England, a good deal of Blood spilt on the Occasion, Lord George [Gordon] sent to the Tower, Martial Law declared [. . .] a Million of Money granted to the King for his Tryal & for bringing other Offenders to Ju[stice] and to defray the Damage done by the Mob.(2)  I must request the favour of you to relieve me if you can without great Inconvenience, about the last of October. I am heartily tired of this place & wish to be at home as soon as possible; add to this that it will be very disagreeable to travel if the cold Weather should set in before I take my Departure, and will make it difficult for me  to get on, as I have lost the only good Horse I had, and the State of my Finances are such that I shall not be able to purcase any thing more than a Garron,(3) if I can accomplish that.

They were so full of ardor that the Count was under a necessity of urging their return to their necessary affairs at home, with the promise of their being again called for, when Genl. Washington should judge that the circumstances of affairs should require it. We are impatient for the arrival of the 2d division of the French Squadron, which we are informed by letters from Boston was spoke with near a month ago by a vessel bound to Salem. The season is advancing fast, & our troops must daily consume provision the bare transportation of which is an immense cost. I perceive that the General Assembly stands further prorogued to the 31st of this month. I am sorry that a state of our claim of territory in the New Hampshire Grant has not yet been forwarded to Congress; for although it is my wish as an individual that this uncomfortable dispute may subside till a more convenient season, yet I would not willingly be under the necessity of saying, when called upon after so long notice, that our state is not ready. It might have the appearance of a consciousness in ourselves, that our claim is not well founded.  Our new Constitution (4) is much approved of by many gentlemen here. I understand it is soon to be in force. I do most earnestly pray that Heaven may direct the people to the choice of a wise man for their Governor, & incline him to accept of the trust.  The post is just going, which obliges me to conclude. I am with very great respect,  Your assured friend & Very hble.

  Sir Philadelphia August 22d 1780 The Inclosed Papers Contain the most Recent Intelligence we have of a Publick Nature from abroad. The Armed Neutrality of so many Powerful Nations in Europe together with the Commotions in England are by no means Discouraging to these States.  A Letter from Mr Jay at the Spanish Court Dated at Madrid the 27th of May (1) last mentions that in Conference with a Spanish Minister he Recd. Encouragement that the Bills of Congress Drawn on him to the Amount of one Hundred Thousand Pounds Sterling would (with some Difficulty) be honored That they had also Conferred on the Subject of a Treaty but Came to no Conclusion.  Congress have Recalled their Committee from Head Quarters which will Prevent any further Correspondence with those Gentlemen in that Capacity.  Majr Genll Green has Resigned his Office of Quarter Master General and Col Pickeron (2) is appointed & in the Execution of that Trust.  All the States (Excepting Delaware) as far Southward as Virginia Inclusively have Adopted the Resolutions of Congress of the 18th of March and will be furnished as fast as Possible with their Several Quotas of the New Bills which are Exceedingly wanted in Every Department.  If every State would Tax themselves to the Extent of their Abilities Relieving the Poor as far as Possible we should find it the Best Resource in our Power to obtain Supplies and Save the Continent from that Enthralment of Debt which may be Expected from Loans. This Doctrine (tho Trite) is no less Important than True and Deserves the most Serious Attention.  The Current Expences of the War are Chiefly of our own Services, Provisions & Manufactures which do not much Exceed our Annual Exports in Time of Peace. This alone is Demonstration that our Internal Resources are nearly Equal to our Necessities and might  AUGUST 22, 1780  with Proper Management be so applied as to Prevent an Innormous National Debt to Foreigners who may hereafter Claim the Honor & Merit of our whole Salvation as Due to them and Surprize us with unexpected Demands.  At Present we have but a Small Prospect of Loans from Spain and as Mr Lawrens has lately Sailed for Holland the Suceess of his Negotiations will not soon be Known.  We are with Sentiments of the highest Esteem & Respect your Excellency's Most Humble Servants. Roger Sherman  Benj Huntington ""

  Dear Sir Philadelphia August 22nd. 1780. I do my self the honour to write your Excellency by this post. Altho I have in my former letters, mentioned the exhausted state, of the continental Treasury, I have not mentioned it on an occasion, in which I was so immediately Interested as in the present. On the  day of July last,(1) I obtained a warrant, on the Treasury, for 5,000 dollars, for which the state was to be accountable. As will appear by the Journals of Congress for that month, I have not been able to obtain one shilling of the grant, nor do I see the most distant prospect. I am entirely destitute of Cash, even sufficient to pay for one weeks washing. Notwithstanding I have borrowed 2500 dollars of Colo. Pettit, which is now wanted. I am also in arear for my Board, and that is expected to be paid every week, and really wanted. Board is exceeding scarce to be got in this City. And generally undertaken, by people in scanty circumstances, who want the money due for one week, to go to market the Next. My Board now Costs me one Guinea per week for my self, exclusive of any kind of licquor and half that sum for a servant in Specia or the exchange at 75 for one, which is much less than many of the members pay, or than I paid for the first Six weeks. This is truly my situation, and I know of no releif but through your interposition which necessity obliges me earnestly to entreat. I am sorry to trouble you with a request of this kind. At a time when I am sure your time must be fully imployed in business of the Utmost importance. And would not have made the application if it was in my power to obtain relief in any other way. AUGUST 22, 1780  By letters this day read in Congress from Head Quarters, (2) there is neither Bread or Flesh on hand, sufficient to serve the Army two Days, to which let me add the state of the Treasury. I must then beg liberty to refer my feelings on the Ocasion to your own Judgment. I can not help mentioning these Occurencies to you, perhaps it may be two much Occasioned by an Overheated Zeal for the Cause we are ingaged in. I can assure you it arises from no ill design; and must beg you & the Honl. Genl Assembly, to pardon me in what ever is over prompt, read in private what they shall think necessary, and expunge what ever shall appear superfluous in this & my former Lett.  I take the liberty to mention one other malencolly circumstance among others that at this time present themselves to my vew on relateing this. The Torys in the lower County of Deleware grew mad at paying Taxes; about 300 of them flew to Arms and bid defiance to all authority. The Militia of the state was called out & have Quelled the rioters, but not without the loss of a Number Killed and wounded on both sides. I have not yet been able to obtain all the particulars but this is certain.  Since my last, Congress have receivd. a letter from Mr. Jay, dated Madrid the 30th of May, (3) by which it appears a difficulty is likly to arise in Settling a Treaty with the Spanish Court. The King of Spain by his minister demands as one Article in the Treaty, The free, Intire and absolute Navigation of the River Missisippi, Which measure Congress will not willingly agree to.(4)  I have the Honour to be your Excellencys Most obedt and Most Hume Servant, Ezek Cornell  NB.

  Sir, Philadelphia August 26. 1780 I am favored with your Letter of the 7 Instant, thank you for the Communication you give me on the Subject.  Congress have uniformly adopted the Practice of admitting all Persons within the British Dominions, or under their Government, to remove themselves with their Effects into these United States, in all cases where the Person applying for Permission can give satisfac- AUGUST 26, 1780  tory Evidence that they have never taken Part against us, and are sincerely desirous to riske their Lives & Fortunes with the Independance of these United States.  This Practice was adopted upon mature Deliberation, as founded, not only upon Principles of Justice & Humanity, but dictated by good Policy. Upon these Principles, Persons with their Effects coming from Ireland under the Character above described are exempted from Capture; and among the Number that have been permitted to come with their Effects and unite with us I have not heard of any Impostor though it is possible there may be an Instance.  The Case of George Howell you mention may be an Imposition,' but he gave satisfactory Evidence to Congress of the Sincerity & Uprightness of his Intentions & Proffession to riske his Life & Fortune with the Independance of these States, and that he had never taken any part against us. Persons of undoubted Character testified, that having been on the Island by Permission, Howell had repeatedly told them in confidence, he was determined to leave the island and take Part with his Country, that he knew he must sacrifice whatever he might leave behind and was desirous to bring off his Effects with him, that he had been impelled by Necessity and Family Connections since he came of Age to remain hitherto upon the Island, that he was now fully determined to come off if he could obtain Permission &c.  In short he gave satisfactory Evidence of the Sincerity of his Intentions & Profession to Congress, who have ever appeared very jealous and carefull to guard against Imposition in such Cases and much more in giving Favors or Preference to the Enemies of their Country.  Mr Howell was a perfect Stranger to me and before unheard of, but upon the Representation of his Case, Congress were so far satisfied as to order the President to give him a Permission & Passport for himself and his Effects, which I was bound to obey and indeed as his Case then appear'd, I see no Reason why it should not be granted.  If he be an Impostor and has been guilty of deceiving Congress with Respect to his true Character, they would be very desirous to know it, and have him detected and properly punished.  I should be much obliged to you for any Evidence that may be obtained to prove he has from the Beginning of this War appeared an open avowed Enemy to the Independance of America, and that he is a known Enemy to these States, or that his Professions & Intentions to Congress were not sincere.  I am perswaded that from your known Attachment to the common Cause and Zeal to promote it, you will readily transmit any such Evidence as may be obtained on this Subject, and I can assure you Congress will not be wanting on their Part to adopt proper Prb-  ceedings against any Person that has been guilty of such gross Imposition as is supposed in the present Case and on the other Hand if the Man be sincere and innocent, Justice to him requires it should appear.  The Permission granted to Mr Howell is not an uncommon Priviledge, it has been uniformly granted to proper Characters on Application. Congress may have been deceived in Characters, tho' I have never heard of a single Instance. The Case of Mr Howell may be a Deception, if so I most sincerely hope it may be made to appear. The Discovery and Detection is not difficult with those who have the Means of Knowledge, and Justice to our Country requires it should be done.  I have the Honor to be, with Sentiments of Esteem & Respect, your most obedient Servant, Sam Huntington  P.S. Since writing the foregoing I have receivd a letter from Govr. Trumbull on the Same Subject & Shall write him a particular account of the matter.(2) S.H.  ""

  Dear John Philadelphia 26th Augt. 1780 I receivd yours of the 23d May from Madrid with duplicates  AUGUST 26, 1780  thereof & of the Letters you wrote from Cadiz & Martineco.(1) The original of the first of these came to hand shortly after I wrote my Letter of the 22d Decr. the last never. You have I flatter myself before this time recd. four Letters which I directed to the care of Docr. Frankling.(2) I shd. send you duplicates of them were it not that having been home not long since I left all my papers there for which I had no immediate want & the drafts among them. Your remembrance of the pleasurable days of our youth & the scenes in which we mutualy bore our parts together with the attractions which this country still has for you afford me the most pleasing hope that neither time nor absence will weaken a friendship which has so long stood the test of both-and this indeed I expected from the steadiness of your temper, but I must confess I had little hope that yr. speedy return would afford me a prospect of deriving that consolation from it in the decline of life to which I looked even while it animated the pursuits & pleasures of youth. You mistake your own heart when you say you are unambitious & without the assurance you have given me I should have believed that that ambition would have kept you continualy in the line in which you now are-more esspecially as the general satisfaction that your appointmt. & conduct since has given will render it the wish of every body less interested in your return than I am to keep you abroad. You tell me nothing of Mrs. Jay tho' I am the more interested in hearing of her health as I am told she is like soon to increase the Deaplomatick body-present my best comps. to her & tell her that on reading her letter to her mother from Martinique I partook both in the pains & pleasures of her voyage.(3) I believe I told you not long since (4) that I had seen your Son & jersey friends who were all well since when I have heard nothing from them but that they are still so. Your son is a very fine boy. We have talked of a match between him & my girl & I have accordingly rejected many advantageous proposals. Mrs. Livingston about Whom you are so obliging as to inquire is very well.  I have not been able to procure the means of using the cypher you direct me to so besides that it is extreamly troublesome & difficult (5) I shall therefore be obliged to confine What I have to say to meer common occurences & enclose a cypher which you will find very easy & utterly impossible to decypher while the key is concealed as the same figure serves to express a variety of Letters. In order that you may know whether it comes safely to hand, I have in this letter used the precautions mentioned in yours.(6)  Our (7) advises from the Southward are far from being pleasing after the loss of Charlestown the enemy extended themselves as far in to the country as Cambden which is about 90 miles thro' a thin settled country. They took several other posts so as to secure the greater part of South Carolina. When the militia recovered their first panick & found themselves supported by a body of continental troops they  collected under the command of Genl Gates and were extreamly successful in a variety of skirmishes with them surprizing & cuting off most of their posts when Gates advanced with his main body consisting of about 900 continental troops & 2000 militia to within 7 miles of Cambden where he was attacked by Cornwallis with his whole force. The militia being surprized fled at the first fire & Genl. Gates in order to raly them quited the ground while our regulars remained fighting nor did he stop till he reached Hilsborough which is near 200 miles from which place on the fourth day after the battle he writes to us but as he knew nothing of what passed after he left the place and we had reason to conclude from his account that all the continentals were cut off--But by better advises we learn that they maintained the battle with great spirit after the flight of the militia had enabled the enemy to turn their flanks that they retired in such order as totally to destroy the enimies horse which attacked them on their retreat and it is even said they have brought of[f] their cannon. Genl D'Calb is dangerously (some say mortally) wounded. No other Officer of distinction as we have yet heard is mising. As we are in hourly expectation of some further information I hope to receive it before I am under a necessity of closing this. We have long been flattering ourselves with a prospect of recovering New York & giving by the assistance of france a descisive blow to the enemy, for this purpose we took measures to augment our army under the command of Genl Washington to 30000 men but our prospects grow more & more faint every day. The first division of the french fleet has been & still continues to be blocked up by a superior fleet at Rhode Island. The second have not yet sailed that we can hear. The militia tired out are returning home. Our Magazines are exhausted & our finances before sufficiently deranged have been still more disordered thereby. Your Old friend the Confederacy is still here owing to our inability to procure the necessary means of fitting her for sea. However I believe that obstacle will be removed in a few days. Our privateers have been uncommonly successful. Every day sees new prizes enter our ports, among others no less than 29 of the Quebeck fleet richly laden have been brought in by the Boston & Salem privateers & twelve more are said to have been taken by a french ship of the line & the remaining 8 fearful to proceed because of the privateers that were cru[is]ing in the gulph of St. Lawrence have put into Halifax. The combined fleets in the West Indies have separated & thereby lost a noble opportunity of taking Jamaica which is in a manner defenceless as Govr Dalling with the greater part of the troops from that Island is said to be upon an expediton to the Spanish settlements in the main. I write you occurences without order just as they arise in my mind because I know that in your situation facts are of more importance to you than deductions from them. But as in proportion to a mans distance from home is his avidity to hear   from it I must not forget our poor little State. She has never rested a moment from her labours, the enimy still harass her on every side. Some of the finest settlements in Tryon County have been cut of[f] & the militia have been in the field the whole season. But her distress has not shaken her firmness, on the contrary toryizm declines among us every day. Our political system moves on much as usual without any great change either of men or measures. Be sure I have a thousand things which I could wish to communicate but I dare not for want of a cypher acknowledge the rect. of this therefore as soon as possible as there are many things you shd. know that you will not be able to learn from our publick Letters. Nothing astonishes me more than the effrontry with which the Ministry & their friends assert that America sighs to return to their government since the fact that we never were more fixed in opposition. Nor if we except the derangement of our finances were we ever so capable of resistance. Our friend Smith is said to have imbibed the ministerial Madness so strongly as to have prevailed on Genl Kniphausen to march out of New York into the Jersies before Clinton returned from Charlestown hoping that discouraged by the loss of that place & weary of the war the militia would not oppose him. And he shd. (as Mr Smith is said emphatically to have predicted) have the whole honor of terminating the war before the return of his principal the experiment proved the folly of the Idea. The militia flocked together on the 1st summons, some of them taking their horses from the plough rode down full speed hung them to the fences & engaged. People of all ranks & ages collected & all that was effected by an army of 5000 men unopposed except by militia & about 2000 continental troops was the destruction of 20 farm houses & the abuse & murther of some women after which they retired with the loss of 500 men killed, wounded & taken-since which they have been much less sanguine. Adieu. Remember me to the Coll.(8) & Mr Carmicall. Again offer my affectionate compts to Mrs Jay.  ""

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia August 28th. 1780 I do my self the honour, to inclose to your Excellency, Several late Acts of Congress,(1) Which I have been the more carefull in doing, As I expect the Honourab. the General Assembly, will meet about the time this will reach you. I can not help making some remarks on them, especially the one which is for raising, 3,000,000 of dollars by Tax,(2) As it is of great importance to these states. If it can be raised by the time limited, It will give such releif as to enable Congress, in some measure to fulfil their promises, and keep up some kind of credit, Provided the New money, goes into circulation, persuant to the resolution of the 18th of March; and Congress are immediately supplied with the four tenths. But the whole taken together, will be short of a sufficiency to discharge the publick debts, of the Current year. But when I consider the Inhabitants, groaning under the burden, of the Monthly Taxes already called for, and the Other incidental charges, that arise in the several states, to which may be added the reluctance with which the Inhabitants, in some of the states pay their Taxes, I almost dispare of the 3,000,000 of dollars equal in value to silver and gold, being collected. And without that sum being raised, and the four tenths being punctually paid, I see no practicable means of even keeping the Army together for any Considerable time. And at present I see no other way of raising money than the aforementioned. At the same time my feelings are exceedingly hurt, when I reflect on the inability that I fear my constituents in general labour under in making payments of all the publick money & stores demanded of them. It is a popular opinion here, that the whole expence arising in these states for publick useses is practicable and aught to be paid by publick Taxes within the year, Which will amount to at least 15,000,000 of Dollars of Specia vallue upon the most [eco]nomical plan. Borrowing money at present, is scarcely practicable, at home or abroad. A foreign loan cannot be expected, unless a sufficent fund is raised, to pay the Annual Interest, at least, and apropriated to that use, by certain and fixed Laws. The raising such a fund is now under the Con[si]deration of a Committee of Congress appointed for that purpose, they have not reported, but have in contemplation to recommend to the several states to lay a duty of Two & half per Cent on all Exports, or one and a half on all Exports  AUGUST 28, 1780  & imports, And a duty of Two & a half on all prize goods to be apropriated towards the support of the Continental Navy.(3)  The resolution for liquadating the outstanding debts in the staff departments,(4) I think must give some satisfaction to the Creditors. And is so just I apprehend it Can give offence to none, Especially where more than an equal proportion is due, as is the Case in Rhode Island. But be that as it will; necessity and policy, obliged us, if we were poor to do somthing that had the appearance of Honesty. The complaints of publick creditors, were become exceeding loud, & it was intirely out of our power to make payment.  The Resolution impowering the Q.M.G. and C. G. of purchas to give certificates(5) I hope will give some releif in this time of General distress, for want of money. But there is yet remaining many demands for Money of the greatest importance to the Operations of the present Campaign, that no possible means can yet be found to Supply.  These hints I have thrown together not that I wish to direct or hinder or discourage, any measures that are undertaken, But that I may be directed. By liveing in this City 3 or 4 months I know but little of what will be agreable to my Constituents, To do which and render my Country real service would be the summit of my ambition. Some of the Members that have been in the City a much longer time, appear to me to know less of the abilitys and disposition of their Constituents than I do, which I apprehend sometimes causes a difference in Sentiment.  I have the honor to be your Excelleny most Obedient Huml Servant. Ezekiel Cornell  P.S.

You wil be pleased to observe that a Complyance with this recommendation will in a manner Contravene our late Law for Emitting fifty thousand pounds at least it will be to no purpose to Issue it as Whatever we Strike, So much less of the Continental new Bills is to be put into Circulation.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia August 29th. 1780 Since the inclosed letter of the 27th Instant, (1) Several matters of Importance, have been laid before Congress, which I think it my duty to acquaint your Excellency of.  Firstly a long letter from General Washington,(2)giving a Summary Account of the Complaints of the Army, truly great if not alarming, stateing to Congress the absolute necessity of giveing relief, Also the ill policy of Bringing men into the Field for short periods; together AUGUST 29, 1780  with many more difficultys, too tedious to trouble your Excellency with. Also the proceedings of the Committee from the N England States,(3) which I make no doubt your Excellency hath recievd a Coppy of, before this will reach you. All which hath been referred to a Committee, that wass before Appointed to make an Estimate of the expence of the Current and ensuing years, and to provide ways & means for furnishing the necessary Supplies. It appears at present that Congress are determined to recommend spirited Measures to the several states which I hope they will adopt, that we may no longer lull ourselves to sleep by a false hope of a peace, or ruin our selves by frequent alterations in Our Systems in the great Departments which our Army now feel the effects of in a Severe Manner. I should have been exceeding happy to know the Sentiments of the Honl. General Assembly on the proceedings of the Committee of the New England States, the more so as it appears Govr. Bradford was not present. Many and perplexing are the difficultys that attend the Measures undertaken by Congress. But this I can asure your Excellency, that I never had the honour to be acquainted with any sett of men whatever, in which party made so little appearance, as in the present Congress; and nothing appears at present to be their wish but the public good  Yesterday a Letter from Governor Trumble, was read in Congress, accompanyed with letters and petitions to him, from the Inhabitants of N London, Groton and Stonington, Complaining of the proceedings of Dr. Howel, in Bringing goods from Long Island, to Paukatuck River, Supposing the Protection signed by the president of Congress was illegal, or a forgery. But for the present let it suffice for me to say, the protection wass legally obtained in Congress upon a representation that he was a friend to these states; and that it was the interest and ought to be the policy of them, to introduce all such people and their property, into them, As power & dominion, consists in the Numbers, and wealth of Inhabitants.(4)  One resolution I have mentioned, is in the inclosed newpaper, to which I beg liberty to refer you, as I had not time to Coppy it, some other late Acts of Congress have passed, that I should have been happy to Inclosed; but had not time to Coppy them, I hope the One inclosed respecting the Flower will enable Mr. Southwick to repay all he hath Borrowed, as well of the Inhabitants as our Allies.(5)  My inclosing these Resolutions will not hinder the Secretary of Congress, from forwarding them in the Usual manner. But lest they should not arive before the Assembly should rise, I have done my self the Honour to Inclose them as I suppose they wish to know what we are about.  I have the Honour to be your Excellency's most obedient, Humble Servant, Ezek Cornell  ""

 John Hanson to Charles Carroll of Carrollton Dear sir Philadelphia Aug. 29th 1780 I am favoured with your two letters by the post for which I am much obliged to you. It always gives me much pleasure when I receive a line from you.  Congress had a letter from Mr Jay Dated Madrid May 26th, 1780.(1) It is very long and the Contents of some parts of it I am not at liberty to make Known. Sir John Dalrymple with his Lady was then at Madrid. He Came from Lisbon by Land under pretense of Travelling through Spain and France to England on account of His Ladys health. However he requested a Conference with the Count de Florida Blanca the minister of Spain who told him that what ever he had to propose must be in writing, upon which Sir John in a day or two after Sent him a paper a Copy whereof is inclosed which I send you as more Acceptable, than any thing I have at present to Communicate-must request you will Keep it together, and after purusal, Send it inclosed to Doct. Thomas at Frederick Town where it will again fall into my hands. You will be pleased to request the Doct. to Keep it to himself. Our embarrassments from the Deranged State of our finances, are daily increasing, and how we Shall Keep up the necessary Supplies for our Army I am at a loss to Conceive. No money in the Treasury nor none expected in any Sort equal to the pressing Demands, which are daily made by the Staff departments. Bills of Exchange would procure us money but drawing without a probability of their being paid is discouraging. Yet I believe the measure must be adopted from necessity.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia. August 29th. 1780 Yesterday morning I received your favor of Saturday by Mr. Sterett.(1) Congress have for a month past been so distressed for want of money, that nothing but hope could have supported them under it, and that hope, to wit, remittances from the States Eastward of Virginia (the others being reserved for the Southern army) has now failed them; almost all the taxes are swallowed up in discharging debts contracted in the Quarter Master's & Commissary's departments, and what little surplus remained, we are told by all the States, is employed in equipping & marching the militia on the present expedition. Had the whole been paid into the Treasury of the United States, it would have amounted but to a third part in value of the sum expected, the depreciation having trebled since the requisition made of the several States. You now see our situation: all the resource we have is the new money; if that should not freely circulate, or AUGUST 29, 1780  should it speedily depreciate, we shall be at our wit's end; however recent steps have been taken to give it vigor. I fear we shall at last be compelled to have recourse to the Tories, for one of Charles the lst's Benevolences. In short, we seem to be all very grave, and the General's late letters are much more so than usual: however, si male nunc, et olim non erit.(2) Let us but make prisoners of the British army at New-York, and all will be soon well.  If a Land-Office is opened soon in this State upon the footing you mention, viz. of revenues only, Pennsylvania will have money enough for another and yet another campaign: there must be no condition of settlement as contended for by some; there should rather on the contrary, in my opinion, be a condition of forfeiture in case of settlement during the war, except by persons at present resident in the back Counties, for obvious reasons. To limit the quantity of land to be granted to any one person or family is useless and impracticable. The great object of a present sale must be the purchase money, and an increased fund for taxes the next year; and many foreigners may be induced to speculate in this way, and thereby become really interested in the event of the war, and in the prosperity of Pennsylvania in particular. I shall exert my best endeavors to have this work accomplished during the present session of Assembly, and that I may be enabled in future to attend to the affairs of this State only I have quit Congress yesterday,(3) except to make a few reports. I have served my Apprenticeship, to wit, in seven Congresses.  I am greatly relieved by your favorable account of the Militia: those of the city must be much reformed since I had the command of a Battalion of them. There were then some of the most rude, turbulent, impudent, lazy, dirty fellows amongst them, that I had ever beheld; but I suppose they have chiefly gone into the army, or joined the Enemy. At any rate I feared you would have had much trouble with them. Congress have passed an Act, giving the Presidents and Governors of States the rank of Major Generals in the Line, whilst they are with the Army.(4)  There is an opinion entertained here, that the 2d Division was seen near Bermudas, and I have some hopes that it may be so. The Alliance, Captain Landais, is arrived at Boston-there are no official accounts received, but you may rely upon it, she has brought at least the following articles-10,000 suits of soldiers clothes; 50 tonns of powder; 20,000 stands of arms; many cannon, 18 and 12 pounders, besides other things we much wanted. Report speaks of larger quantities of each of the enumerated articles.  The notice you have been pleased to take of Mr. Sterett is very obliging to me: you will find him a young man of unshaken integrity, indefatigable industry, and of abilities beyond his years, accompanied with a becoming modesty.  I wish a continuance of your health, and a glorious campaign to AUGUST 30, 1780  yourself and country, and am, my dear Sir, Your Excellency's most obedient humble servant,  ""

  Dear Sir Philada. 30th August 1780. Having been two or three days in the Country, I coud not Sooner acknowledge the receit of your favour from Trentown, but hope Mr. Henry has sent you the Resolution of Congress on the Subject of which you wrote, which if not done shall be inclosed.(1) Mr. Henry & my Self first formed & agree'd in the Resolution, the utillity whereof at this crisis so easily gained the attention of Congress that it passed with little debate, and will we hope on all hands be acceptable. I need not enter into the principles whether of policy or of justice, wherein it is founded, as those must naturally occur to every dispassionate reader acquainted with our Situation.  The General has wrote Congress a very long letter where in he goes considerably into the politicks as well of Britain as America so far as they respect, or may tend to protract the present contest.(2) He enveys warmly against Short enlistments & asscribes many evils to that cause-tells us that next January he will have but the Shadow of an Army, thinks it ought to be filled up by drafts for the War, but that for less than One year is absurd-thinks that Congress must again assume the whole business of and providence of the Army at present 13 instead of One Congressional Army-Pays Pennsylvania a distinct compliment on that score but says the effects are bad, as other States are not prompted thereby to make equal provision. With regard to the present great Object his apprehensions are of the Sable kind, doubts the number of men, and Sufficiency of provisions & Forage- Shews they are now Obliged ungraciously to take in the Military way-That combinations are forming agst. taking Continental money-That the Officers arrears by depreciation must frequently be liquidated & Certificates given them for what cannot be paid-that Resolves of future justice will no longer do-&c &c.  Your Lady & Family are all well, and the Seat healthy & delightfull. For near a Week past I have been much indisposed, and obliged to AUGUST 30, 1780  take a Puke for the better Operation of the Bark-Wrestling a little for the General Officers & the Army brought on a Slight fever followed by a Sick Stomack & want of appetite, which the fruit of the Vine failed to recover. There is a Capital Question respecting our Western extent & free Navigation on the Missisippi Suddenly to come on, in answer to a late letter from [Mr.] Jay (3) if this were discussed, I hope to be at full liberty to retire, especially as Mr. McClane now attends-three good members at once in the House is sufficient. We hear that rather than return any of your Militia, the Genl. wishes you to Supply them from the County of Bucks. He mentions the middle of Sepr as the latest period for commencing the investiture of New York. If Competant numbers should appear to fail, what do you think of private intimations thro' some channel or other, for a certain distribution of plunder, under Some limitations?  I am Dear Sir with every cordial wish to you & the Young Gentlemen of your Family-Your most respectfull, humbl. Servt.  John Armstrong [P. S. ] I have yet heard nothing of Genl.

  Dear General Philada. 31st August 1780 Since my return to Congress in the latter end of May, few Weeks AUGUST 31, 1780  have passed in which I did not intend the pleasure of writing you- Yet can the fault of Omission I now acknowledge be imputed to no other cause that the progressive langure and infirmity produced by an attention to business often perplexing in it Self, and a tedious debate with the dissolving heat of this City.  At present I know of nothing new, but an account Yesterday brought by a Vessel from the West Indias, that some British Ships of force has lately gone into the road or Port of St. Martins & there captured & carried off Several American Vessels-by Steps of this Sort the Dutch may at length be led to more than mere neutrallity.  Little did I expect a few minutes ago that the nex[t] paragraph Shou'd convey you the melancholy intelligence which it contains nothing less than an entire defeat & total loss & dispersion of the Southern Army-being confined to my Room I have not Seen Genl. Gates's letter, a Copy of wch. no doubt the President will Send you.(1) Mr. Burks Letter puts the misfortune wholely on the want of a Magazine of provisions, by saying in effect that Genl. Gates must either risque that battle or disband his troops, to which he adds there were favourable prognosticks by a Series of success in the Scirmishing way. Genl. Cornwallis was at the head of three thousand or more with a great Superiority of Horse. The advance guards began in the Night both Armies on the March & both it's said wishing to gain the Same ground-at day break the line was formed-the Virginia Militia supported by Armong [Armand's] Corps on the Left, N Carolina Militia in the Center-part of the Maryld. troops on the right & the residue as reserve near the Center. The left wing Militia & Center Suddenly fled & cou'd not be rallied & left the few Continentals Surrounded by Horse & foot. Genl. Smalwood is Said to be killed, Baron DeCalb wounded & a prisoner-Genl. Gates said to be pursued fifteen miles-Coll Armong pursued twenty five miles & killed thro' the failure of his Horses. Dismal as the best Story may be yet a little time will furnish a more accurate & perhaps better account, as when the express came off there was not a Shadow of an Army any where, nor any Magazines to repair to. I intended adding a few thoughts on the Objects of the Campaign and on the recall of the Committee from Camp but find my fever increasing & must desist-with respect to the last, take not the recall as matter of discouragement, but ask what your own consideration may dictate as necessary either of Congress or of a particular State, and if it can be had I think you will receive it.

 SEPTEMBER 1, 1780  Sir Philadelphia Sepr. 1, 1780 We were honored with Your Excellency's Letter of the 21 August. (1) The enclosed papers contain the best intelligence we have from the Southward, our affairs there appeared prosperous, our Army gaining Strength, & in Several Instances considerable advantages against the Enemy, until the Battle near Camden on the 20th day of last month, they were overpowered by a Superior force, and met with a total defeat.(2) This loss will not be easily retrieved. The Southern States Seem disposed to make as vigorous exertions as their circumstances will admit.  The fluctuating State of our money, and the want of Sufficient Supplies of it, have been the principal Causes of the wants of the Army. When the States were called on for their monthly quotas of 15 millions of dollars the Estimates were made at the rate of twenty for one, but before the taxes were collected, the prices of Supplies were at 60 for 1 which made a deficiency of two thirds of the Estimates. When the States were applied to, to furnish their quotas of provisions, it was expected that the legislatures would only appoint Commissaries to purchase them, and that the Quarter Master's department would have been So regulated, as to have received the provisions from the State Commissaries, into proper Magazines, and have transported them to the army. This regulation was delayed about four months by referring it to the Committee Sent to headquarters, who instead of compleating it immediately, Applied to the Executive powers of the States to do the business proper for Quarter Masters &c. Congress have appointed a Committee to make Estimates for the current year, (3) up to the 1 March next, and also for the next year, who have made considerable progress in the business. Congress have also made provision for making good the depreciation to creditors who have furnished Supplies. Founded on your Excellency's Letter of the 8th June last, (4) a tax is also recommended to raise money for the payment of the public debts, to the amount of three Millions of dollars, this tax is likewise intended as a means of introducing the New Bills into circulation in full Credit.  The proceedings of the Commissioners from the Several States convened at Boston were read and referred to the Committee of ways and means.(5) We are pleased to find their Sentiments correspond with the measures that have been lately adopted by Congress.  The affair of the Protection Granted to George Howel (6) we apprehend is not rightly understood by those who complain of it. Dr. Howel was represented to Congress as a person who was a Minor when the Enemy came to Long Island, that he is now under twenty two years of Age, lived with his father, and had taken no part in the pres-  ent controversy, but was well affected to this country, and was determined if possible to get from under the power of the Enemy, with all his effects, and Settle in Some one of the united States. These things were not only Said by himself, but confirmed by Doctr Wm. Smith late of Long Island, who has been for Some years a Surgeon in the continental Hospital, & Served with fidelity and reputation. Your Excellency We believe has Some knowledge of him, both he & Dr. Howell are well known to Col. Floyd. It was well known to Congress that his Effects were chiefly English goods, which he had obtained by drawing a prize in the British State Lottery.  There was Nothing Mandatory in the Protection Granted by Congress, or that interfered with the Laws or Government of any States, but it was a notification that Congress approved of his coming off from Long Island with his effects, and a protection against capture by cruisers under commissions from the United States. There is a general resolution of Congress, that persons coming from Great Britain or Ireland with their effects to Settle in these States Shall be exempted from capture, and a Protection was lately granted to Doctr. Shields & Some other Gentlemen from Ireland, to bring their effects to this City. And does not Justice as well as policy require that Citizens of any of the united States, Should be protected in coming with their property from under the power of the Enemy, who have not forfeited that right by any Crime against their country?  If this person has been Guilty of any fraud by covering Illicit Trade under his Protection, we wish he may be detected & Suffer; but we have No Suspicions of that kind, but believe he has an honest bona fide intention to get, and keep clear of the enemy.  The Several resolutions which concern the States, will be forwarded to Your Excellency by the President.  We are with Sentiments of the Greatest respect, Your Excellency's Obedient humble Servants,  Roger Sherman  Benj Huntington ""

  Sir, Philadelphia September 1, 1780 I am honored with your Excellency's Letter of the 21 Ultimo with the several Despatches to which it refers, respecting George Howell; and am ordered to explain the Circumstances of his Application, and the Passport granted to him in Consequence thereof. (1)  Enclosed you have a Copy of his Memorial to Congress, upon which he produced satisfactory Evidence, that he had never in any Instance acted an inimical Part against the United States; that, he but lately came of Age to act for himself, being not 22 Years old, and had in Confidance revealed to some of his Friends who had been incog on to the Island by Permission, that he was determined to remove from thence, (now he was of Age to act for himself) and risk his Life & Fortune with the Independance of these United States.  By a fortunate Ticket in a Lottery in England he had drawn about three thousand Pounds Sterling, and as he could not obtain the Money had determined to invest it in Goods, and leave the Island if he could obtain Permission.  This representation being made by Persons of undoubted Character who had personal Knowledge of the Facts, Congress were satisfied of the Sincerity of his Profession, and supposed his Case to come within the rule which had been uniformly adopted, and ordered the President to grant him a Pasport & Protection which was accordingly given.  The Form of the Pasport is the same as had been uniformly adopted, and it did not occur to Congress that it would ever be construed as mandatory, Commanding all Governors &c, but merely as a Protection on the Seas, pledging the Faith of the United States against Captures at Sea, and giving Notic thereof to all proper Officers-BE IT K[N]OWN &c. The same Form hath been repeatedly used in giving Pasport to Vessels & Effects coming from the British Dominions in Europe & the West Indies, and in those Cases the same Diction extended to all Officers, Governors, Generals, Admirals &c acting under the Crown of France or Spain &c  Wherever Mr Howell landed his Effects he must obtain the Approbation & Protection of the State, and be subject to the Laws of such State. If he be an Enemy to his Country, and has abused his Pasport to cover Effects which were not his own Property, he ought to forfeit the whole; but if he hath been Sincere in his Representation, upright in his Conduct, and means to riske his Life & Fortune with the Independance of these United States he will probably be approved & accepted in the State where he shall reside. SEPTEMBER 1, 1780  The Propriety of a full Examination into the Circumstances of this Case is obvious and will doubtless be made by the proper Authority.  The Practice of admitting proper Characters to remove from under the British Government with their Effects and unite with us was adopted upon mature Deliberation, as founded, not only on Principles of Justic & Humanity, but Policy. The Instances have been frequent, and tho' Congress are very jealous & cautious not to admit an Enemy, or be deceived by an Impostor, and if Howell on Examination should be found such it will be the first Instance I have known or heard of.  Your Excellency will recollect the resolution of Congress in Favor of Persons with their Effects coming from Ireland to settle in these United States, exempting them from Capture, which hath ever been in Force from the Commencement of Captures by Sea; and the Case of an Inhabitant of these United States who hath the Misfortune to fall under the Power of the Enemy within their Lines is a much Stronger Case in Favor of the Subject if he be a Friend to his Country and hath Opportunity to escape with his Effects.  The Case of Mr Howell will depend upon the Character & Conduct of the Man, but the Principles upon which Congress acted, are the same by which they have been uniformly governed in repeated Instances, ever Since the Declaration of Independance.  I have the Honor to be, with the highest respect and Esteem, your Excellency's most obedient servant,  Sam. Huntington President ""

I wrote your Excellency very fully and by the last Post, (1) little expecting to write you again so soon, but the importance of the inteligence in Congress the 31st Ulto.(2) lays me under an obligation of giving you a most disagreeable narative of Our situation in the Carolinas.  I will not say that General Gates hath had a general Action. But that he hath suffered a General and total defeat is certain by his letter dated Hilsborough North Carolina August the 20th 1780. It is imperfect and I have no liberty to take a coppy of it. But I do my self the honour to inclose a coppy of one from Mr. Burk a Member of Congress for N. Carolina who went home since I came, to which I beg liberty to refer you for particulars therein contained, And leave further particulars to be digested by time.  I am this day informed that the Militia of this state are on their March home from Bucks County where they have been for some time As they could not be subsisted at their Quarters for want of provisions. I have not been informed of the particular reason for their returning.  Much time hath been taken up in an affair of Mr. Howel both before I wrote you last and since.(3) A letter from General Varnum and one from Mr. Howel upon the same subjects hath been laid before Congress with Governor Trumbull's where upon it was ordered that the president Inform Governor Trumbull the circumstances of Mr. Howels application and Pasport grants in consequence thereof. Rhode Island is left with out advice in the Matter. I make no doubt he will be treated agreable to the rules of Justice and good policy. I shall only add that Dr. Smith a gentleman of good Caractor in this place who is as he saith well acquainted with Mr. Howel, saith many clever things of him, such as will I suppose induce Congress to wish every such person possessed of a good fortune to remove with it into some of these states....(4)  I have been in dayly expectation of receiving the Act of our general Assembly for funding the Money to be Emited persuant to the act of Congress of the 18th of March last.(5) It is not yet come to hand. I wish it may arive soon. As I mentioned in my former letter that I feared it would be a long time before the Bills would be struck, these fears are by no means removed. I most zealously wish to see these New bills in Circulation in all these States in full faith and credit. SEPTEMBER 2, 1780  I must confess I cannot be sanguine in my Expectations on this head at present. A few days since a gentleman from Massachusetts Bay came to this City with some of the New Bills emitted by that State. He could not pass them at any rate even to pay his Expences. Mr. Adams gave him Continental money in Exchange. If we cannot establish some sort of Currency among us upon a permanent footing in which the people at large have full faith, It appears to me not to need the Spirit of prophecy to foretell that our ruin is not far distant. I cannot help here mentioning one circumstance that I wish to remain a profound secret, at least to be Communicated no further than the good of the state may require. I had the honour to be one of the Committee that waited on the Minister of France yesterday (6) to know if he thought it was probable if Congress should draw Bills on the Court of France for Forty Thousand pounds sterling that they would be Honoured. The minister was free and open and after fully stating the low state of their Finances and the purposes for which they had been drained[?] he frankly told us that in his opinion it was impossible they could be accepted if they were drawn, to which may be added that we have not the least shadow of promise that a Bill for £20 on any power in Europe would be paid. All publick business in the great departments of the Army are at a Total stand accept the Bank and the supplies from that Quarter fall much short of our expectations. Thus stands our affairs of Finance and Supplies for the army.  Congress are endeavouring if possible to reconcile matters so as to bring about a complition or Ratification of the Confideration as every member is more and more convinced of the Necessity of the measure .  It appears to me our mode of doing publick business especially in time of war would ruin any Nation on Earth. Congress perhaps three Months in passing a recommendation to the states, three more in adopting it and then the sloath there is in some of the states in executing them it appears hath lately ruined one Army And Our main Army upon the Brink of starving.  It is absolutely necessary to Collect another Army to the Southward to stop the Career of the Enemy or where will they stop. But what is to be done to procure Arms! Accoutrements, Cloathing, Provisions, Tents, waggons etc. Is harder for me to solve then a problem in Euclid. perhaps a query will arise where is the Arms in the hands of the Militia at home, to which I answer they never have had any....(7) 200 Horse and about 3000 foot.  I hope your Excellency will pardon me both as to the Number and length of my letter and not Trouble the General Assembly with any more of them or such parts thereof as you may think desirve their Notice. It is my wish to give you every information whither it militates for or against us.

  Dear Sir Philadela. Sepr. 2. 1780. Your favour of the 26th of Aug. addressed to the Delegates I have had the Honour of receiving. On enquiry I find that the Embargo is continued to the 30th of this present Month in this State and to the 20th of Octr. in Deleware.(1) It has been mentioned in Congress and thought expedient by others, that the embargo in all the States should be taken of[f]. The propriety of the Measure is now under the consideration of a Comttee of Congress, (2) and till they have reported, and the Determination of Congress is known, it appears to me proper that the embargo should be continued. As other States have continued it for a short Time Maryland I suppose will follow their example.  The Fate of the Action on the morning of the 16 of Aug. you must have heard. It is a melancholy and distressing blow for Maryland, and a ruinous and destructive one to the Southern States. I wish it was in my power to give you the Fate of our gallant Countrymen, and to relieve the pain and anxiety of those Distressed Families who wait with a powerful impatience to hear the Sacrifice of their dearest Connections. But it is not in my power. Genl Gates Letter,(3) which is wrote two hundred Miles from the Field of Battle gives no other information than, that they were left by the militia and himself on the first fire, surrounded by a Force infinitely their superior in Numbers: \""That their Bravery is highly to be honourd as they made SEPTEMBER 2, 1780  as great and as gallant an opposition as it was possible so small a Force could make against one so vastly superior\"". This account I suppose the General gives from the known and established valor of the Troops; it could not be from his knowledge of the Action, for he does not appear, by his Letter to have seen the regular Troops after two oClock in the morning when the first skirmish took place. As the State of Maryland was deeply interested in this Action, I thought it my Duty to move that the Letter should be published, but Congress determined and I now believe very wisely, that it should not. It must be known sooner or later, and whenever it is, you will join with me in pronouncing it a very extraordinary one. I Shall forbear at present to make any observation lest my resentment should carry me beyond the bounds of propriety and Justice. Col. Ramsey who will have the Honour of delivering you this Letter will explain to you the line of March, the order of Battle, and the State in which our troops were left-from the last information we can collect from the Gentelmen sent by General Gates with the Intelligence. It is believed, for my own part I have no doubt, knowing what passed previous to the action, that their Fate is a severe one: Tho I hope it is not so bad as their fugitive General expresses it in the two first lines of his Letter. \""In the deepest distress and Anxiety of mind, I am obliged to acquaint your Excellency with the total Defeat of the Troops under my Command.\""  Reports, which the two officers bring, say that many officers fell; among the rest General Smallwood, Col. Gunby, Majr. Winder, Majr Roxburg, Capt. Brooks (reduced to a certainty), Col Armong &c &c &C.(4) I trust this voluminous Catalogue will considerably diminish when we have a more accurate account; some of our officers will no doubt escape. Till then, or the return of a Flag sent in by General Gates, we must remain in the dark. For further information on this melancholy subject, I refer you to my friend Col. Ramsey.  I am, Sir, with the highest respect and Esteem, Yrs,  J. Henry Junr.  ""

  Dear General, Philada. 3d Sepr. 1780. The Arival of the Young Gentlemen with your Dispatches to Congress Shewing the Sudden & unexpected defeat of the Army under your command, must like every other event of that kind stand subjected to the various Strictures of mankind forming Opinions on Subjects in their local circumstances too remote for accurate & fair decision even to judges otherwise competant. Being indisposed I was not in the House when yr. letter was read, but have not learned that Congress either then or afterward have Shewn the least dispossition to censure; a general concern as well without as within doors pervades the minds of the well disposed, and the more easily Obtains from a consideration of the deranged Situation of Our affairs in every quarter of the Country. Our expectations however are Still lively and Suggest the late misfortunes to the South as so many prompters to greater vigour & firmness in the future exertions of those States, wherein Virginia, for many reasons ought to be deeply interested. Your letter is committed, but the result uncertain. Conjecture will probably pronounce that Congress having lately exerted every nerve that embarrasments almost indiscriptible would admit, little more is to be expected from hence, whilst our Objects rise no higher than that of defence, to which at a proper distance you may again become competant-but on the Arrival of Governor Rutledge you will be informed of a different design, which requires time & various preparatives in order to give it effect. At present our Sanguine expectations respecting the Attact of New York begin to abate for this Season, thro' the delay of the 2d division of the French Fleet, yet these hopes have not fully expired altho' the Militia of the Several States are now discharged thro' Scarcity of provision, or rather the want of money to procure it & the transportation thereof, but we wish the good people with you [. . .] (1) ground, viz that Several or all of these middle States have large demands on Congress for Supplys to our Army, a considerable part of it now going on in the second Year. Our Southern friends must trust also, tho' not so long if they give a ready circulation to the New money when their Quota comes to hand, the currency of which only can Save us.  By Some mistake we had been informed that you had Eleven SEPTEMBER 3, 1780  thousand men a considerable time ago-that the Enemy left Camdon and retired to Moncks-Corner &c. Had this been the Case, my first apprehensions were lest you Shou'd follow too Suddenly into the unhealthy part of the country. That risque however is over for the Season, and Experience will alwais favour the propriety of training raw Militia by gradual Skirmishing-by harasing & impeding the Enemy, rather than by risquing a general Action, which to you I am confident was not matter of choice, but of necessity circumstanced as you must have been.  The Second division of the French fleet has in fact been blocked up at Brest by thirty odd British Ships of the line, so that we have now but little expectation of their arrival in time for an expedition agst. New York before next Spring.(2)  ""

  Sir, Philadelphia September 4, 1780 I have been honored with your Excellency's Despatches of the 21 Ulto by Messenger Brown, one of them enclosing the Proceedings of the late Convention at Boston, (1) the other respecting the Case of George Howell, (2) both which have been laid before Congress.  Enclosed you will receive several newspapers, that of the 29 Ulto contains an Account of several Advantages gained by our Troops to the Southward; since which the Scene is tottally reversed.  In the Morning of the 16 Ulto Genl Gates with the Army under his immediate Command consisting of about 3,000, part Continental and Part Militia of Virginia & more Southern States were totally defeated in an Engagement with the Enemy near Cambden S. Carolina under Lord Cornwallis. The Number of the Enemy supposed about 3,000. We have no Particulars of this Action. It is said the Militia fled at the Beginning of the Engagement, Genl Gates in vain attempted to rally them and finally escaped himself with his Aids by the Fleetness of their Horses. In his Letter of the 20 Ulto he informs me he is totally defeated, and shall give more particular Intelligence of the Event of the Action as soon as it can be obtained. I am yet in Doubt what Judgement to form as to the Cause of this Disaster & how far it might have been prevented, but am fearful our Troops were too much flushed with their various Successes & the Advantages they had lately gained and were too rapid in advancing without sufficient Strength & Caution. It is said they had not Magazines of Provision & were obliged to move to get their daily Subsistence.  This unfortunate Event at present engrosses the Attention of Congress to adopt Measures for the Defence of the southern States and prevent the farther ravages of the Enemy in that Quarter.  The Situation of our Finnances yet remains distressing, and seems the true Cause to which every other Difficulty & Embarrassment may be traced [up?].  It is from this Source Congress have been driven thro' dire Necessity to adopt Measures which they would have gladly avoided, and which I presume are disagreeable to all, & perhaps unaccountable to some of the States.  It may be justly asked, Why are not Magazines laid up before hand in Season? Why are not the Creditors to the public paid without Delay? and why are not many other Things done which it is so obvious ought to be done? The Answer is obvious I need not give it.  A stable Medium introduced it appears to me would go a great Way towards relieving the Difficulty. Were our Finnances on such a Foundation that Ways & Means could be timely obtained to defray  SEPTEMBER 4, 1780  the necessary Expence of the War, our Affairs would wear a better Aspect than the most sanguine could have expected.  The late Declaration of the Empress of Russia respecting the rights of neutral Powers &c seems to have very considerable Influence, and we have daily more fully & undoubted Intelligence that the Powers of Europe, especially the maritime, favour the Cause of America, and Great Brittain seems left without a single Ally, or any Assistance except what she has obtained from the petty States in Germany.  I have lately received a Letter from an Officer, Consul under the Emperor of Morrocco in Behalf of the Emperor inviting these United States to trade in his Ports, and giving Assurances that they may & shall enjoy all Priviledges of any maritime Power, and that he is disposed to enter into a Treaty of Commerce with us.(3)  I have the Honor to enclose herewith Copy of a Letter from a Gentleman in London to his Friend in America, but take the Liberty to observe it ought not to be published, least the Author should be thereby exposed.  The Period that confines me to my present painful Situation is almost expired (4) and as I have been long absent from any private Affairs & my health somewhat impaired with the Burthen & Fatigue of Business, I hope to obtain Leave of Absence in about a Month and wish a Gentleman from Connecticutt better quallified may come forward to relieve me.

  Dear Sir Philadela. Sepr. 5th. 1780. Majr. Giles has a Warrant from the Board of War for a Number of Articles, which I am in hopes will cloath his troops tolerably well for the present. He is still in this Town where I have advised him to stay untill he has secured his Clothing, which is in the Store at Camp. He will not be wanting at camp immediately, as I am afraid all hopes of offensive operations against N. York is entirely frustrated by the Want of a superior naval Force. The General has discharged the Militia of this and other States, partly from the cause above, but principally for the want of provisions. The Army has been for some Days without meat and has only depended upon the gleanings of the neighbouring Country which is now entirely exhausted. Flour is from day to Day scantily supplied, and often a small quantity is gone which the General has drawn from West point. There is not a Nother Barrel nearer than Trenton. It is in vain to veil our Situation, the Army must disband, unless other States will do as Maryland has done; If Laws taking the surplus of provisions wer passed in some States relief might be given. The Generals Letter upon the present State of the Army is a circular one, (1) and I presume you have it before now. All the provisions that have been procured ought to be forwarded as soon as possible. This subject I flatter myself will engage your Excellency' and the Council' attention.  The plates for the new Emissions meet with great delays. It was with some difficulty that we procured metal proper for them.

  Dr sir, Philada. Sept. 5, 1780 I wrote you a long Lettr, of 21 Augt., giving you a State of Affairs here, since which I have not heard from you.  Letters from France, by the Alliance, a Continental Frigate lately arrived at Boston, inform us at length, that the 2d Division of the French Fleet destined for America, is blocked up in the Harbour of Brest. In Consequence of this Intelligence, and the advanced State of the Campaign, Genl. Washington has laid aside the Idea of attempting N. York, and has disbanded most of the Militia. Genl. Washington advised us yesterday that the British Fleet had left their Station near the East End of Long Island, and had put to Sea-we do not yet hear whether they have returned to N. York.  It is now some days since we received Genl. Gates's Accot of the Defeat of the Southern Army. Nothing ever yet happened, either of a publick or private nature, which so deeply affected my Spirits. That his army should fight & be beaten, would not have shocked or dispirited me;-but that the No. Carolina & Virga. Militia, on such a critical Occasion, should one and all (as it were with one Consent) not only refuse to fight, but quit the Ground in the utmost Confusion, while every Effort of the Commander in Chief & of Majr. Genl. Caswell to rally them on the Field & during a Retrograde progress of 4 Miles proved ineffectual; and after all abandon their SEPTEMBER 5, 1780  Officers and take to the Woods, wounds me to the Heart and is indeed truly alarming. What Congress can or will do for the Southern States I know not at present. If the second Division of the French Fleet should arrive this Fall & give us a Superiority on the Water, there will be no Danger to the Southward, indeed every thing might be retrieved; without this Superiority every thing is to be feared, as Genl. Clinton may with Safety detach half his Force from N. York, while he commands by Sea.  I am very anxious to return to No. Carolina. Be so kind as to relieve me as soon as your Conveniency will permit, pray do not defer it by any means longer than the last of October.  I will write to you by the next post, if any thing to communicate.  Remember me particularly to my friend Mr. Robt. Smith. Present my Wifes & my Respects to Mrs. Johnston & Miss Peggy and accept the same yourself.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia Sepr 5th. 1780 I received Your letter of the 20th Ultimo. Yesterday. I wrote You by Brown the 2d Instant (1) & have nothing New to add. We are in hopes our loss at the Southward is not So great as was Apprehended-by accounts from N. York tis Said, that they did not view it as a total defeat of our army, but that the Militia gave way & they pursued the continental Troops Some Miles, and made Some prisoners. I hope next News to hear that most of the Continental Troops have escaped. The affair of Howel's is fully represented to the Governor. He was recommended by Dr. Smith who has been acquainted with him from his Infancy. Howel Lodged at Mrs. Cheesman's during his Stay here-he appears to be a modest Agreable Young Gentleman. He obtained his goods by drawing a prize in a British State Lottery. We understood that they amounted to Some thousands of pounds N. York currency but not So much as three thousand Sterling. He told me that he Should Sell them for continental currency, the New Bills, or any money current in these States. I understood that he intended to dispose of his goods & Settle in this City & practice Physic.  No person is more against carrying on a trade with the Enemy or any person within their lines than I am. Yet I think every Citizen of these States who is within their power has a right to Claim protection from the States if he can escape with his effects, and ought to meet with every encouragement, if he has not by any crime forfeited the protection of his Country. I make no doubt but that Dr. Howel had an honest intention to risk his Interest with these States, and to contribute his proportion toward carrying on the war-in case he met with kind treatment-but he may be prosecuted to desperation. I hope justice will be done to him & the public.  The Assembly of this State are now Met, and I hope they will take measures to introduce the new Money into circulation in good credit-the form for printing the Bills is so worn that it became necessary to make a new one, which is now preparing. While the press is employed in finishing the quotas of Massachusets & Connecticut, the next will be for this State, Virginia & Rhode Island. If the States dont immediately issue the Bills all our operations must Stop, for there is no money in the Treasury nor any other resource. A New Arrangement of the hospitals on an Economical plan will take place in a few days.(2) I hear that Mr. Peabody is near his end being in the last Stage of a Consumption, at Morristown. There are complaints of the want of meat in the army which I did not expect at this Season. SEPTEMBER 5, 1780  I am with great respect, Your humble Servant, Roger Sherman  P.S. It is of great importance that the people of the States Should have the fullest confidence in Congress. I never knew better harmony among the Several Members, than at present, nor more Universal attention to the public good, & no appearance of party Spirit. R.S.  ""

It is now one week since I took my seat in the great Council of the nation, (1) Since which time I have been so busily employed in getting a house and endeavoring to arrange my future domestic oeconomy, together with my Duty in Congress that I have scarce had time to recollect my self or think of my Friends. I now write this only to shew you that I mean to write whenever I can, but not as a full answer to yr. favor which I intend to be the employ of the first Leisure hour. The only news worth relating is that Congress have recd. a letter from the Consul of France Residing at the Court of the Emperor of Morocco, through the Channel of our Minister at Paris, in which his Imperial Majesty of SEPTEMBER 6, 1780  Morocco has made an overture for a treaty [of trade] and Commerce to these United States; (2) and it is moreov[er] said that this Magnanimous Prince declared himself to an American Gentn. who happend to be at his court on Commerical matters, that he regretted exceedingly that it was not his lot to Reign over a free People, but he saw the danger if not impracticability of altering the form of the Government of his Empire.

  Dear Sr. Phila. 6th Sept. 1780 I have received your favour of the 13th ult. upon the subject of a Report respecting a certain Gentleman and thank you for the freedom and candid manner of your Communications. (1) The resentment discovered agt. the Gentleman alluded to began to subside before your Letter came to hand and though for sometime it was occasionally mentioned in conversation it has lately dyed away and will I expect not be revived. The Report of the Committee not only accepted his resignation but went further and I believe had it been then determind the Gentleman would have been informed his Services in the line of the Army would have been dispensed with that he might have liesure to attend to the settlement of his accounts. Had this step been taken it is probable a resignation would have ensued and perhaps a public discussion in the papers wch. could have produced no good and upon the whole I am well pleased the matter was carryed no further than it has been. But unacquainted as I am with antecedent circumstances and judging from what was before me my Opinion was the Gentleman was justly reprehensible for the manner of his conduct as a Servant of the public employed in an important office or as a Citizen embarked in the common cause of America. The SEPTEMBER 6, 1780  amasing Sums of money gone into that Departmt under his superintendance, abt. Eighty millions and it is said about thirty millions unpaid the whole of which is unaccounted for has excited uneasiness not only in this Body but the people at large who call out for a settlement of the public accounts and although repeated endeavours have been used to bring the Officers in the great departments of the Army to account none have been rendered nor any likelihood of bringg. them to a settlement. The embezelmt. & waste of public property in these departments have greatly contributed to enhance our Debt and depreciate the currency and these abuses demand inquiry and punishment but I see no fair prospect of obtaining satisfaction for past transgressions and shall be happy to find we shall be able to avoid the like practices in future. A reform or an attempt to Reform seemed absolutely necessary for the satisfaction of the public and although the new System was pronounced a physical impossibility in execution others who have served long in the Army and were of the Committee that made the alterations entertained a contrary opinion and they affirm the Gentleman now in office if he can be supported with money can fully carry the new System into execution. In short I have seen some and have been told of so many abuses in the Q. Masters, Comries. and Medical departments in the course of the last two years that I candidly confess I feel a degree of resentment agt. the conduct of many in those Departmts. bordering on prejudice so nearly that I have resolved to condemn no person even in opinion without clear proof of delinquency least I should injure the Character of some honest Man in the general censure wch. unhappily is but too prevalent.  What I feared for some time is at length but too evident that our designs agt. New York must wait for more favourable circumstances to attempt carrying them into execution. Perhaps something may in the course of the winter be done to the South should we be in a situation to recover our losses there and be in time provided with a well appointed Regular Army and magazines of provisions laid up. It is to be hoped we shall in the Spring before the Enemy can be reinforced and obtain supplies be in condition to act offensively agt. N. York. Your Letters of the 20th last month and the 27th circular to the States are before a Committee and will in a day or two be reported upon as to Flour and meat.(2) The great objects of drawing forth in time a competent regular Army and laying up Magazines will soon come in and I hope soon go through Congress that the several States may proceed to make the necessary provisions. I shall leave this place on Thursday for Virginia and mean to attend our next Session of Assembly in hopes of promoting a cession on the part of the State of their claim to the Lands to the N.W. of the Ohio to the united States which will be recommended to all the States having unappropriated western territory for the purpose of   compleating the Confederation.(3) I shall be glad to hear from you while there upon any matters that may occur and you shall think proper to communicate.

  Dr sr. Philada. Sept. 6. 1780. Mr. Hill & myself wrote you a long Lettr. of 15th Augt .-to which I beg leave to refer. Your 2 Lettrs. of Augt. 6 (to the Delegates, and to me) came to hand yesterday. I am very sorry for the Distresses of the State and for your Embarrasments. I hope the Assembly by this time will be convinced by Experience of the good or ill policy of the Laws passed at the last Session, and will without prejudice or passion repeal or continue them, upon that principle; You observe that the State has Strength & Resources equal to her Defence & sufficient for the present critical Occasion; but that proper Laws have not been enacted to call them forth. I was myself at the last Assembly at Newbern, and can say from Observation that those Members who did not attend shewed the greatest Willingness to adopt every Measure which appeared to them necessary for the Security & Intt. of the Country; if they failed it was on Accot. of the Multiplication of Business before them, and for [lack] of Judgment not of Inclination: but no Apology in my Opinion can justify those Gentlemen who undertook to serve their respective Counties, and neglected to attend & discharge their Duty, when the critical Situation of the State so pressingly demanded their Labours & abilities. Surely every Man must now be roused by the Defeat of Genl Gates's army to a Sense of their Danger, and I flatter myself that they will join with Unanimity, Wisdom & Fortitude in every Measure which may tend SEPTEMBER 6,1780  to avert the impending Ruin. I will give you a short State of Affairs here, from whence you may the better judge what is necessary to be done by the Assembly of No. Carolina. Genl. Washingtons army is now reduced to the Lines of the New England States, N. York & Pensylvania, with one new Regiment of Mary Land troops 500. Many of these consist of new Recruits raised for 6 months, and the Enlistments of many of the Veterans expire in January next; so that by the month of Febry. the Contl. army under his commd. will probably not exceed 5000 Men. He has stated this matter to Congress and pressed most earnestly that the Contl. Battalions be compleated to serve during the war, by the Month of Jany; and Congress is now deliberating on the Subject, and will no doubt urge the proposition to the States: probably they will not be able to comply with the Requisitions in point of time & if they do, I think it will be very difficult if not impossible to prevail on Congress to order any of the Contl. Troops from Philada. Eastward to the Defence of No. Carolina during the ensuing Winter. Possibly the Maryland Regiment & some Cavalry may be ordered to the So. ward; but you must not depend even on this. Virginia & No. Carolina will probably have the whole weight of the Southern War on their Shoulders, during the ensuing winter, and our assembly ought to provide accordingly.  If the 2d Division of the French Fleet destined for america should arrive this Fall, and give us a Superiority on the Water there will be no great Danger in No. Carolina; indeed every thing might be retrieved, as the French Troops would probably be employed in the Southern Departmt. if provisions could be procured for subsisting them but Genl. Washington informed us yesterday (1) that the 2d Division was blocked up in the Harbour of Brest by the British Fleet. We will then suppose the British Fleet to be superior on our Coasts during the Winter; in which Case it is probable that Genl. Clinton will detach a strong Reinforcement to Charlestown and that a vigorous Winter Campaign will be carried on against No. Carolina. Under these Circumstances Militia alone can not be adequate to the Defence of our State, therefore I condude it is indispensably necessary that our Contl. Battalions should be completed, whatever Expence may accrue or Difficulties occur on the Subject.  Graves's fleet left the East End of Long Island Saturday week and stood to Sea; we have not heard of their Arrival at N. York. The Board of War before my Brothers Departure 2 ordered 2000 Stand of arms to No. Carolina via the Bay; the Vessel was chased and obliged to land their arms; but they have been since ordered on, but I cant tell to what place. Congress proposes to borrow some arms from Virginia for your immediate Use, and to replace them at a short period. I wish our assembly would make some further Efforts for supplying the State with arms & Military Stores. A Laboratory is established at Richmond for the purpose of supplying the Southern  SEPTEMBER 7,1780  Department with various military Stores. The Board of War have prepared 300 pistols & Swords for Whites & Washingtons Cavalry & have sent them or will immediately send them to Baltimore, to go from thence with Saddles which are making there for the same Cavalry. With some Difficulty I have found the Goods left here by Capt. Read. There is a hhd & a box; but I know not what they contain, nor is it possible for me to send them on at present. <<I think it is essentially necessary that our assembly make vigorous Exertions to procure small arms e Cloathing for their Troops.>  Congress I believe expect no Money or provisions from Virginia and No. Carolina for Northern purposes. Our State must establish Magazines of provisions and now is the time to do it.  Not a Shilling in the Contl. Treasury.  If any thing wanted Assembly to require it; Ought to call for new Maryd. Regt. & Lees Corps.  Naval Comms. shall be sent.  ""

  Dear Sir Philada 7th Septr 1780 On my way to Congress I had the Mortification to learn that our Southern Amy under General Gates had met with a fatal Check near Camden in South Carolina. The particulars are involved in impenetrable obscurity. We wait impatiently for Authentic Information that we may lay it before the publick, and endeavour to repair our misfortune by a vigorous Effort suitable to so deplorable a Catastrophe in Appearance, for if it has the effect of animating Virginia to put forth her Strength and great Resources it may eventually prove a benefit.  All our Accounts from Europe are encouraging I think without a single Exception. The armed Neutrality of the maritime powers, particularly, must if Britain persists in her obstinacy produce Events highly favourable to our Cause. From the papers it is remarkable that both the people and the Parliament talk of the Independence of America as probable, as a Case that ought to be provided for: And this they debate without the Danger of Su.ffrocation to which they were not long since exposed by the vehement Passions which were raised whenever the Subject was hinted. Indeed Sir if we had but the means, the power, of drawing forth the Resources of our own Country, for one Year, there seems to be little doubt but with the divine Blessing we should put a glorious Termination to the War. Our only want is money, or a Credit with our Constituents for such a portion of their produce and substance as will raise an Army for another year and feed the Army for one Campaign: for I do seriously believe that if we had such an Army in the field our Enemies would not think it worth their while to linger out a second Campaign in a Land of Liberty where they would then see that Misfortune instead of Despair produced Vigour, and that Distress of submission produced Courage and perserverance.  In the mean time the Want of money is a fatal Clog to the Wheels of Government and exposes us to every Species of Insult and Calamity. The necessary Supply chiefly rests with the States. In Vain is it to look up to a Congress who have little more power than to  SEPTEMBER 7, 1780  advise, and who cannot exert the Force of the Union but thro' the respective Legislatures: to a Congress whose Rights or prerogatives are undefined: and whose decisions are consequently subject to the Deliberation the Acceptance, or the Rejection of the several Members which constitute the Union. Midst our embarrassments Congress yesterday took the Step our State had so much at Heart for accomplishing the Articles of Confederation: the Delegates of Virginia and Maryland supported it: and I am persuaded it will produce a final Ratification by the Accession of Maryland. Your Excellency will receive an official Copy of the Act of Congress on this Subject as soon as it can be prepared. (1) Nothing of a publick nature occurs for your Excellency's Attention. For myself I must add a word. The Approach of the day for deciding our Contest with the Vermonteers compelled me to leave the State unprovided with money for my support. My little private Stock has long since been exhausted, & I have trespassed upon my Friends as far as the Circumstances of the times coud Justify. There is no supply to be obtained from the publick Treasury: The Result therefore is plain: We shall be necessitated to return home in a very few weeks; unless it is in your Excellency's power to produce for us a speedy Remitance. This is a disagreeable Reflection!  I have the Honour to be with the Utmost Respect, Dear Sir, your Excellency's most Obedient & Very humle Servt.  Jas Duane P.S. No part of the former Remitance came to my Hands.(2)  ""

  Dear Sir Sepr. 7th. 1780 Your many Letters to Congress up to June 2d have been read with Pleasure and I have recd. two from you-March 16, 29, recd. July 20th.(1) Mr. Lee is not yet in Philada. perhaps he may have another for me. You will not learn any agreable Things respecting yr. native Country however, the defeat of Genl. Gates on the 16 of Augst. was not so bad as we at first had reason to think. Perhaps Baron de Kalb is mortally wounded the others who were said to be killed are safe, I mean Genls. Guest, Smallwood, Stephens, Rutherford, Butler & Gregory, so is Col. Gunby. The militia all scandalously fled at the first fire though two deep against a single sparce file of the Enemy; SEPTEMBER 7, 1780  all except one Regt. of Nth. Carols. commanded, on the occasion by a continental Col. Dixon. These with the Regulars bravely stood & pushed Bayonets to the last. When overpowered by numbers they retreated well and being pursued by Horse repulsed and compleately vanquished them. A Wounded officer is confident that only two of the Party escaped. Col. Sumpter who had been successful in taking a Party of the Enemy a day or two before with 40 amunition Waggons was overtaken by Horse and lost all again with some muskets into the Bargain. Genl. Nash & Govr. Jefferson write most agreably as to the Spirit with which this Defeat is repairing. Ten such are nothing if-if there is enough of Virtue to support a paper Currency. While the new money is as silver and gold eastward it is far otherwise here. I cannot attribute the Conduct of their People to a settled Enmity to our Cause but to a damnably debauched Temper, too much riveted, which was generated by a depreciating medium, if solid Coin only was in this Quarter it would require much time to correct the most exorbitant Disposition of the People who chop & change.  No decission is yet made upon those Parts of yr. Letters which demand one. I have before told you that the Disposition here is the same as you discover upon all the Points but a definite order cannot be passed to govern you under all Contingencies considering how opposite to one another they may prove in a short Space of Time.  I have not lately heard from Mrs. Adams. Doctr. Holten writes me Aug 21 that he had not seen Mr Lee who was gone to visit Mrs. A at Braintree. I have sent him Bills of Exch. on Doctr. F (2) at 60 days Sight for 500 dolls, 501 1/4 having been decided as the Balance of yr. acct.  I have told you that R I (3) charged in a Lump 1600 Louis per An. Expences and that his Bal. was pd. He said he did not go to Vouchers of Barbers & Taylors and Bakers Bills in his private and therefore not in his public Concerns. Which of the Precedents already set the other Gentlemen will follow may be easily guessed.  My own family was in a distressed Condition. Wife, only Daughter & oldest Son in Bed the whole family a Sacrifice to Extortion and much involved. I have sold myself for 14 years,(4) I imagine by staying here almost 4 even if the same generous Allowance should be made to me as was to you for Service. Being here and master of Books & files & Dates I will not seriously think of quitting till A.L. is as far gone as R. I.(5) Give my Love to all your Connexions. I suppose Gerry will write often by way of Gardoqui from Marblehead in Boston. The army is to have pay made good. The Genl. Officers are to have a 7 years provision proportionate to their pay and to receive Lands also proportionate. Widows & Children to have the Benefit of late Husbands & Fathers. In short we had once an Army fighting for   Republicans but they say they are now fighting the battles of asiatic speculators and must be so considered.  New York having ceded western Claims it is recommend to all who have them to do likewise and our Sister Maria (6) is coaxed to finish the Ratification of the Confedn. If the accomplishment of that as it now stands will give you Pleasure I think you may count upon it. She discovered that she wished to be coaxed.  A tax of 3 millions hard (7) is called for to be compleated by the last of Decr.  We are at a Stand if we have not a Supply of money. Before we get what we ask for on Estimates the People have cursed it down to a quarter of its Value, we Estimate all in hard now. JL ""

  Memorial September 7, 1780 The letter of William Glascock, esquire, to the President of Congress, dated at Augusta in the State of Georgia, the 12 day of May last, denying that he had subscribed an address to Congress, purporting to be a state paper from the Assembly, calls necessarily upon the underwritten member of Congress, who transmitted that paper whilst he was Governer of the State, for Explanation.  He, therefore, declares, that, sometime during the session of that Assembly which elected him Governer, a committee thereof waited upon and informed him, that they were appointed to draw a letter of Address to Congress, and were directed to confer with him; that, in consequence, he had several conferences with the Committee upon the subject matter thereof, and he recollects that the seperate objects of the one now in the Secretary's Office, belonging to Congress, were agreed upon, and the Chairman was instructed to draft it accordingly.  The Assembly about the same time passed a resolve, requesting the Governor to dispatch an Express to Congress with the public communications, which he forthwith engaged, and having all the SEPTEMBER 7, 1780  official papers ready, except the letter, the subject of this discussion which he expected from the grounds mentioned, applied to Mr. Glascock, the Speaker, respecting it, who told him that the Committee had not yet drawn it up.  That he believes it to have been post-poned, on account of other pressing business, until near the rising of the House, which it did abruptly, many of the members being obliged to go out with the Militia; not, however, without ordering the letter to be completed, and the Speaker being of the Committee, was directed and said that he would sign it: but before it was done he went into South-Carolina, telling the underwritten, with whom he lived at the time, that he had desired the Committee to subscribe his name to it.  And the underwritten now officially & solemnly declares, that, previous to his dispatching the Express to Congress, the honorable Richard Howly, esquire, Chairman of the Committee, delivered him the said letter or address, signed with the name & addition of the Speaker; and which folding up to the size of his packet, he superscribed it with the usual address, and transmitted the same to the President of Congress, as he deemed it his duty to do.  He would content himself with having answered as to the authenticity of that paper, as far as he knows or is concerned; but he cannot forbear to observe, that some indulgence is due to the proceedings of a Country, surrounded by and full of Enemies, where members of the Legislature were obliged to sit in Council at day, and scout against the Enemy by night, and where some irregularities, by consequence, ought to be expected in the transaction of public business.  Should the merits of the particular clause in the said address, respecting Brigadier-general McIntosh, and its counter-part contained in Mr. Glascock's letter-signed it is true by him-self, but written by the panegyrist of that Officer-be made the subject of inquiry, he shall not fail to present a memorial of facts upon that point.

  [September 9? 1780](1) The Underwritten declares, that a Committee was appointed by the assembly of the State of Georgia, at the sessions of November 1779, to draw an address to Congress, which was accordingly done, Agreed to by assembly, and officially Entered on the Journals of the house.  That the paragraph respecting, Brigadr. Genl. McIntosh, was a part of the Said letter, and had the Sense & approbation of the house.  That William Glascock was likewise one of the Said Committee, but the abrupt rising of assembly having prevented a fair copy of the Said address, to be produced to the house during its time of Sitting; to have the Speakers Signature necessity occasioned its being done afterwards. That William Glascock, being called by Some affairs, respecting himself to the Congress in South Carolina,  SEPTEMBER 9, 1780  directed, and verbally Authorised, the Committee to affix his name, to the Said address. That the Committee, then presumed it a Matter of indifference; and the Underwritten Still considers it so; which of the persons names composing the Said Committee, was affixed to the Said Address; but thought it a matter of Compliment, that as one, was Speaker; his name Should appear. That the Anxiety of the Committee, was confined, to the Substantial acquittal of [their] Duty, in complying with the orders of assembly, and preparing the agreed address, in a proper form, to be transmitted to Congress. That the paragraph concerning Brigadr. Genl. Mcintosh, in the address of assembly, Corresponds with the Sense of the Governor & Council, as may appear by a reference to their resolutions in the office of the Secretary of Congress.  That the Underwritten, left Augusta on the twenty fourth day of May last, and had not heard a Single Syllable respecting the purport of a letter to Congress: dated on the twelfth of the Said Month, and Signed by William Glascock-that the Clerk of the General Assembly, who now is in this town, (2) and had left Georgia on the 4th of June [...] In frequent conferences, with the President & Executive Council, previous to his departure; had not heard any thing of the Said letter.  That the Underwritten, is informed, by the Said clerk of assembly, that after this the Said Underwritten's departure from Augusta a Commission of five persons was made out, to Wait on the British governor in Savannah and that the name of William Glascock, was in the Said commission or appointment, that it is presumed the Situation of that Gentleman, being in the power of the Enemy; has exposed him to impressions, dissimilar to his former principles; and Suffered him, Under Coercion to Sign a paper, derogatory to his own avowed declarations.  That as to the matter of fact, The Committee may if they think proper refer the Same to the Genl. assembly of Georgia when and where the publick opinion can only be collected in all that concerns the Brigadr. general's Situation-And tho the Executive Authority of the Said State, is entitled, from every practice of form and respect to this reference and investigation, yet they will cheerfully resign the notification and inquiry proposed to the Said legislature.  That delicacy and indeed, principles of equal Justice [for]bid the Underwritten of Entering into any discussion respecting the merits of Brigadier Genl. Mcintosh's case as that gentleman is now unfortunately a Prisoner and-his Situation properly depending on the decision of another tribunal. Richd. Howly  ""

  Honor'd Sir, 9 Septr. 1780. Inclosed you have this Day's Paper, which Contains no Intelligence either from North or South-at present a dead Calm as to News prevails, how soon the Winds may change & stir up Something interesting I cannot precisely predict but from any Information at present I can apprehend nothing of importance very soon; the Object of New York depends you know on the Arrival of the 2d Division of our Ally's Fleet should that be later than I wish, a Southern Expedition must take Place.  I doubt not but your Excellency's Patriotism has lately suffered Distress & Persecution; by Means of the very gloomy Accounts from the South; glomy indeed we had reason to apprehend our Situation there to be, from the early very imperfect Accounts received, but Sir, it has fortunately turned out that we had the worst Part first; by Letters lately from North Carolina & Virginia we find that Matters are not half so bad as was expected, the regular Troops & one Regiment of North Carolina Militia behaved in such a Manner as to make good their Retreat, and do great Execution on the Enemy, particularly their Light Horse, which they have in a great Measure destroyed, at least Governor Nash says a large Part of the Horse in their Retreat they nearly destroyed; the Enemy have Suffered much more than we have, and had the Militia stood five or Six Moments longer the Day in all Human Probability had been our's, & the Enemy totally routed, defeated & ruined, Smallwood & Juest (1) are safe; also Rotherford & Gunby, Decalb wounded as tis s[aid]. Only Part of the Delaware Regiment is supposed to have been in the Action; our Loss in Waggons, Arms &c is Considerable, tis said Smallwood brought off his Artilery, if so he has done great things indeed; our Strength there now is greater than before the Action, & I have no Doubt but that very soon we shall drive the Enemy to Charles Town-they are sickly & this Blow they must severely feel.  Sir, I have been informed since my last Arrival here that Complaints are made by the Marylanders that they are prevented sending their Produce to this Market, to this I cannot make any Answer as I have not yet heard by whom this has been done in that State or how it has happened. Mr. Gaddis complained to me Yesterday that a few Barrels of Flour he had at Appogumomy Landing designed for his Family's Use in this Town, was there detained; & he was obliged to buy Flour here, I directed him to write to your Excellency being perswaded, if his Flour was stopped as alledged under the Laws of the State, you would be able & very willing to Distinguish his Case, & take such Measures as to give Releif, he proposed to put a Letter into my Hands to be forwarded, but has  SEPTEMBER 9, 1780  not yet done that.

There is a handsome Pair of Horses in Town for Sale, about 7 years old, Bays & of good Sise, & well broke as tis said, & I cannot speak precisely as to the Price, but believe they may be purchased reasonable; I know your Excellency stands in Need of another Pair, I therefore move that your Honor would be pleased to sell your old Horses & Carriage & renew them by Purchase, or if you please purchase & then sell, however your Answer on the Subject I shall observe.

  Dear Sir, Sepr. 10th. 1780 I send you by Capt. Barry an Index to the Journals of 1778. We have not yet the particulars of the Defeat of our army from Genl. Gates but we have an account from Genl. Nash to the Delegates of North Carolina much more favorable than we had reason to look for after the first Letter on the Subject. Mankind are so much governed in Judgement by Events that I fear Genl. Gates will lose much Reputation. He thought he should have as much Influence with the militia in that Quarter as in another and therefore made several attemps to rally them till he was drawn far from the Spot where the Action began; and had a right to conclude on the ceasing of the fire that the small Remains of his Army was cut intirely off or dissipated. Being also among very dissafected People he would have been momently exposed to be betrayed as he was without even a guard of Horse. He thought it his Business to endeavor to get from the general Assembly at Hillsborough Something of a new army.  Had he stayed luckily with the small Body of Continentals he would only have been blamed for not exerting himself to rally the militia a trifling Slur to what he now meets with.  I am persuaded there will be a good Body of Men together by this time. I only fear about magazines & arms. We have recommended Provision to be made there for 15,000 as it is to be hoped that something may be done at the southward if nothing should be done in this Quarter.  Indeed, my dear Sir, with a View of public affairs and my own domestic, just at this period. I cannot cordially pronounce \""all for SEPTEMBER 10, 1780  the best\"" tho' I have had Experience enough to be far from Despondency .

  Dear sir Philadelphia Sep. 11th 1780 I have been Confined to my Room a fortnight, and was so unwell When the last post set out, that I was not able to Write, I am now on the recovery, and hope to be able to attend Congress in a day or two. I inclosed you Some time ago a Curious Historical Annecdote, delivered in may last, by sir John Dalrymple, to the Court of Spain. (1) As you have Said nothing about it, am afraid it has not Come to hand.  Congress received a letter by Express from Gen Gates dated Hillsborough August 20th giving an Account (tho' a very Confused one) of His unfortunate Defeat near Camden, on the 16th. He says he marched about 10 oClock in the night of the 15th, to possess himself of an advantageous peice of Ground about Seven miles from Camden. About 2 oClock in the Morning His light Horse was attacked by those of the Enemies but were repulsed. Upon this he halted the Army, and nothing more happened till about break of Day, When he was attacked by the Whole furie of the Enemy. His Army was drawn up with the Virginia Militia on the left, the North Carolina militia in the Center and General Gist on the right-General Smallwood was in the rear, as a Corps De'reserve. The Militia to a man fled the first fire, and left our brave regulars to Sustain the Whole force of the Enemy. General Gates went of[f] with the Militia, endeavouring to rally them, but to no purpose, and while he was thus engaged He Says the fireing between the two Armies Ceased, by which he Concluded all was over, and therefore made the best of his Way to Hillsborough Where he arrived the 19th performing a Journey of 196 miles in less than four days. He Knows nothing SEPTEMBER 11, 1780  of What became of the Regulars, but says he should immediately Send off a flag to gain the necessary information.  Saturday last an Express Arrived from Governor Nash dated the 26th Advising that Generals Smallwood, And Gist, had bravely Cut their Way thro' the Enemy With about 400 men-that the Militia were again Collecting, that they had got together between two and three thousand, regulars included. This day another letter has been received from Gen. Gates With a list of the Officers that are Safe to Wit Generals Smallwood and Gist, Colos. Williams, Gunby and about 700 privates. The list also Contains the Names of those officers that are missing, but I have not Seen it, neither Can I procure a Copy to Send you by this Opportunity. Baron de Calmb is Dead of His wounds. Our loss on the Whole about 500 and that of the Enemy as many. We have also lost all our Baggage Waggons and Eight pieces of Cannon.  Our main Army is in the greatest distress for want of provisions Were Without meat from the 21st to the 26th and Some have not had one day With another not one third allowance. The general moved into the neighborhood of Fort Lee with a View of Stripping that part of the Country of the remainder of its Cattle Which after a most rigorous exertion afforded only two or three days supply and this Consisting of milch Cows and Calves of one or two years old. This manner of procuring is very distressing and attended With ruin to the morals and discipline of the Army, during the five days Which small partys were Sent out to procure provisions for themselves, the most enormous excesses were Committed. It has been no inconsiderable Support to our Cause to have had it in our power to Contrast the Conduct of our Army With that of the Enemy, and to Convince the Inhabitants, that While their rights were Wantonly Violated by the British Troops, by ours they were respected. This distinction must now unhapily Cease, and we must assume the Odious Character of the plunderers instead of the protectors of the people, the direct Consequence of Which must be to Aleniate their minds from the Army, and insensably from the Cause-in short, if this method of procuring provisions for the Army is not very speedily prevented, by an exertion of the States in Sending forward Supplies the Army must disband, and we are undone. It is reported and Credited by many that a french fleet of 18 Ships of the line and some frigates are on the Coast. They were Seen it is Said Some days ago to the Northward of our Capes. Our new raised Battalion is ordered by the general to the Southward. My Compliments to the family And Am with the most Sincere respect, Dr. sir, your most hble Servt, John Hanson  ""

We are informed from the Southward that a pretty handsome affair has been lately performed by a Small Body of the Western Militia on the Borders of South Carolina (1) they were Attacked by the Enemies Cavalry-they Judiciously fell back into a thick Wood-Sustained Several Warm Attacks, and at a period of the Action, when the Countenance of the Enemy began to fail, they Issued from their Cover, Charged them With Bayonets, took 48, and it is Said Killed a greater number. This gallant affair was Conducted on our part by a Colo Williams, Colo Clark of Georgia, and a Colo. Shelby.(2)  It is reported and Credited by many that a french fleet of 18 Sail of the line and Some frigates are on the Coast. They were Seen it is Said a few days ago to the northward of our Capes.

  Dr. Mr. Burke Philadelphia 12th. Septr. 1780.  Your Letters of 21st July and of the same Day the succeeding Month, are now with me, particulars of which I shall answer with as much Satisfaction as possible; mai[nly?] that my expectations have  SEPTEMBER 12, 1780  not been disappointed respecting [the] Effect our Restrictions on the little Commerce of our Sp[ani]sh vessels; nothing could be more certain than the total stoppage of Circulation of our paper Medium when clogged with the like Impediments; however it was a favorite experiment of our Legislature and I doubt not they thought it best, and having experienced the consequences, will I am assured repeal any such pernicious and mistaken Law. With respect to supplies for the Continental Army in our State, it is not to be wondered at, that they were under the necessity of foraging on the Country, not being furnished with Money of any kind to purchase, nor even the proper Officers for laying up supplies, these deficiencies naturally produced the Effects you mention. Congress on Recpt. of your Letter were with much difficulty wrought upon to take up the Subject, and came into the enclosed Resolution promising, public Creditors, assurance against Depretiation &c. (1) When the Day of payment will arrive, time will alone inform us, as our Finances are in as distressed a Situation, as at any period within your Recollection, and I believe more so, as our Demands are much encreased by our Nothern [ . . . ] Armaments. I am sorry to observe that Congress having their whole Attention turned to the old Folly, the Reduction of N. York seem to have forgot the Southern part of the Continent (which I believe must support itself), and your surprise will be excited on being informed that the Virginia Influence is at this critical moment attached to the same ridiculous Object. There has been a large Army assembled in the Neighborhood [for] a few weeks past, but as the British hold the Superiority by Sea, [it was] thought adviseable to have the Militia home, and the Attempt [upon N.] Y. stands reserved for next Summers Speculation; thus this phantom has exhausted the whole Resources of America for three Campaigns, and will I suppose for three or four more; for, from all appearances this must be a War of Finance, and therefore, a small compact Army so established as to act on the defensive, and keep the Enemy locked up in their Garrisons would be the most effectual means of carrying on the War, however our politicians here, think it an easy matter to extirpate the British Force from the Continent. I hope I may be in an error, for no person, wishes more earnestly for an end to this destructive War, than myself, but past experience seems to point out the Impracticability of succeeding in their way; I cant omit mentioning that Genl. Washingtons Army now quite small has been several Days without Meat, and under the necessity of sending foraging parties into the Country to procure daily supplies. This is a fact, notwithstanding the Country abounds with a profusion of every necessary for the Army, but as the public have neither Money nor Credit, such is the State of our Grand Army as it is called; the Arrival of the French Force at Rhode Island contributes not a little to [our?] Difficulties, as their supplies are procured altogether with specie and   consequently the whole Eastern supplies crowd to that Market, while our Troops languish under hunger, or commit Rapin [upon] the Country they are intended to protect.

  Sir, Philadelphia September 12. 1780 I do myself the Honour to transmit your Excellency Dunlaps Paper of this Day which contains a more particular & less disagreeable representation than we had before received of the Battle near Cambden the 16 Ulto.(1) The Governor of Virginia writes that they had again collected an Army of between four & five thousand Men.  By our last Intelligence from the West Indies the french & Spanish Fleets were separated & gone into Port at St Domingo & the Cape and there seemed no Probability of an Attack on Jamaica, at least until after the Hurricane Season. The Cause of this Delay seems at present unaccountable & wants Explanation.  We have just received a report from the Captain of a Vessel arrived at Wilmington, Delaware, from Cape Nichola Mole, that he sailed in Company with a french Fleet, about twenty Sail of the Line with SEPTEMBER 12, 1780  upwards of one hundred Sail of Merchantmen under their Convoy, and parted with them about the Latitude of Bermuda; that it was reported four Ships of the Line were to convoy the Merchant Ships to Europe, and the remainder were bound to Newport, but this I give as a report that wants Confirmation. Should it prove true, your Excellency may probably hear of them on the Coast before this comes to Hand.  The Season is so far advanced that I begin to fear nothing capital can be attempted against New York this Campaign, unless we should soon obtain the Dominion of the Seas by a superior naval Force on this Coast.  Congress are now engaged to devise Ways & Means if possible to have an Army of twenty five thousand Men at least, engaged during the War,(2) with Magazines of Provision for six Months before hand, could this be accomplished there is the greatest reason to believe a Negotiation in earnest, for Peace, would soon take Place.  From the best Intelligence it appears beyond a Doubt that the British Administration flatter themselves that such is the State of our Finnances & the Circumstances of this Country we cannot any longer keep up an Army, upon this they buoy up their Hope, & encourage their People that we shall soon submit to their Terms.  They have every Appearance in Europe against them. The late Declaration of Russia to support the rights of Neutrality operates powerfully against them, and is acceded to by most of the Maritime neutral Powers of Europe already, and will be most likely by all.  I hope no Exertion will be wanting on the Part of Congress, or any of the States, to establish an Army without Delay. It seems highly probable we cannot want them long in Service, unless the British should obtain some very capital Advantage by Sea.

  Dear Sir, Sepr. 12th. 1780 I send you by the Bearer Mr. Payne, to the Care of Mr. S.A. Otis, a Packet from Mr. Milliken. I now send a News Paper containing the best of the southern Affair. But when I say that, I ought to tell you in addition that such an Evil was wanting to rouse the People in that Part. The Loss of Charlestown had not done it. Things now are in a right Train there.  We have been obliged to draw on the Treasurer the 9th of this month a Bill for 79,296 dollars, in favr. of Col. Pickering, an enormous Sum nominally, but here in Sodom 72 for 1 make it in reality small to be equally divided between 3 for our maintenance! 16,935 are in Articles bought for us on the Plan of our Lodging with the Col. and furnishing our own Chambers. The Things left are only Beds & Bedding for 3. He has taken all others to himself and these are purchased at a good Lay. (1) We must sell them again for we have no prospect but of remaining in our present most disreputable Situation bearing all the Credit of the 10,000 God dammies &c. that are flowing from our Parlour Windows, to say nothing of a Variety of other Things highly chagrining to me and more so to my Colleagues. But what I especially am now thinking of is the manner SEPTEMBER 12, 1780  in which our Draughts are pd. Here we receive at 72 for 1: there surely Exchange is not so high: yet that is a Profit which the Lender would make by carrying his money in his Bags. But if your new money is as gold & Silver and yet paid out at 40 is not the Gain enormous? I wish this matter to be put into a proper Train. I hope you will converse in Mode, Tense, Number & Person properly as to both Points connected with the draught.  Your Friend & h Servt. Jas. Lovell  [P. S. ] Mr. T.

  Dear Sir Phila. Sepr. 12th. 1780 I received your favor of the 27th of August (1) by last week's post and should not have failed to testify the pleasure with which I embrace your correspondence by an immediate answer had I not understood from Mr. Jones that he proposed to write you the news, and enclose you the paper of the day. In future I shall endeavor to drop you a line by every post, or at least as often as any thing material occurs.  The delay of Ternay's 2d division and the report of its being shut up in Brest have brought our hopes from the present campaign very low. They have been a little revived within a few days by sundry concurring information, that a large French fleet from the West Indies is on our coast. This story is the more credible, as pretty certain intelligence has been recd. that the French & Spanish fleets in that quarter instead of going to Jamaica as every body expected and their own movements announced, had separated from each other, and gone into different ports, and as there is no other place after such an event where the former could act with so much advantage as on our coast in conjunction with Ternay. Should this good news prove true it is to be regretted that Graves did not stay a little longer off Rhode Island, unless he should return to Sandy Hook of which no notice has been received, where, as his large ships cannot get into the harbour, they must be an easy prey to the superior force of our Allies.  We have the comfort to find from every successive account from the Southward that the late unfortunate affair in that quarter, although truly distressing, is by no means so fatal as was at first held up to us. Our scattered troops are again embodying, and as a sense of shame is now joined to a sense of public danger in the Militia it is to be hoped they will endeavour to cancel their disgrace by extraordinary exertions. Congress have recommended it to Virga. & N. Carolina to form Magazines for a large army, to the former to hasten the march of her new levies, & the latter to take immediate measures for filling her continental line.  Congress have also at length entered seriously on a plan for finally ratifying the confederation.(2) Convinced of the necessity of such a measure to repress the hopes with which the probable issue of the  SEPTEMBER 12, 1780  campaign will inspire our Enemy as well as to give greater authority & vigor to our public councils, they have recommended in the most pressing terms to the States claiming unappropriated back lands, to cede a liberal portion of them for the general benefit. As these exclusive claims formed the only obstacle with Maryland there is no doubt that a compliance with this recommendation will bring her into the confederation. How far the States holding the back lands may be disposed to give them up cannot be so easily determind. From the sentiments of the most intelligent persons which have come to my knowledge, I own I am pretty sanguine that they will see the necessity of closing the union in too strong a light to oppose the only expedient that can accomplish it.  Another circumstance that ought greatly to encourage us under disappointed expectations from the campaign is the combination of the Maritime powers in support of their neutral rights, and particularly the late insolent and provoking violation of those rights by the English Ships at St. Martins. It is not probable that the injured will be satisfied without reparations & acknowledgements which the pride of Britain will not submit to, and if she can ever be embroiled in an altercation with so formidable a league, the result must necessarily be decisively in our favour. Indeed It is not to be supposed after the amazing resources which have been seen in G. Britain when not only deprived of but opposed by her antient colonies, and the success of the latter in resisting for so long a time the utmost exertion of their resources against her, that the Maritime powers who appear to be so jealous of their rights will ever suffer an event to take place which must very soon expose them to be trampled on at pleasure of G. Britain.  I must beg you once for all to excuse the inaccuracies with which the hurry of the post day will deface my letters.  With sincere regard I am, Dr Sir yr. Obt friend & Servt.

  Dear Sir Philada. 14 September 1780 I have taken the Liberty to trouble you with two Copies of the Journals of Congress for 1778, one for the Council, the other for the Assembly. Should have inclosed one for your Excellency, but that the Secretary informs me he sends them regularly as they come out.  We have no further Accounts of the French Fleet than the Papers give you. If the Intelligence be Fact you will have the next News before us as it will come from the Eastward. Some People think the Ships seen were a Fleet of Victuallers which are said to have just arrived at New-York; others that a Squadron of the French are come from the West-Indies to relieve their Friends in Duress at Rhode Island, but not to tarry. These however are mere Conjectures with which it is not worth the While to perplex ourselves as a little Time must produce the Truth.  No later Dispatches from the Southward than are published except a Letter of to-day, describing more particularly the Circumstances SEPTEMBER 14, 1780  of the Fall of Baron de Kalb. (1) This General, deserted by the Militia, fought at the Head of the Maryland and Delaware Troops, assisted by one Regiment of South Carolina Men under Continental Officers, with the most exemplary Bravery and Ability, kept them together with exact Order and Discipline, received and returned the Enemy's Charge with Bayonets till surrounded and borne down with Numbers, his Horse killed under him, himself pierced with two Musquet Balls and eight Bayonet Wounds, he became a Prisoner. He died in a little Time after, and was buried by the Enemy with all the Honours of War. The British Officers attended his Funeral and paid the highest Respect to his Merit and Memory. One of his Aids, who was wounded and taken with him, was treated with Civility by Lord Cornwallis, and suffered to come on Parole to the northward for the Care of his wounds.  It rends my Heart with Anxiety to hear the Army are suffering for Provisions. There is Plenty in the Country and a Willingness to sell, but Money, Money, that is wanting. I am persuaded however if the French Fleet comes in Force, and there should be a Prospect of operating with Success against New-York, the People will yet do much, greatly as we are in Arrears to them, without present Reward.

  My dear Sir, Philada Sept 15 1780 On Tuesday last Congress took up the Disputes relating to the New Hampshire Grants, agreably to an order which passed the 9th of June, and for Want of nine States exclusive of the three interrested ones, the Matter was put off till yesterday. (1) The Delegates of N. Hampshire and N York were prepared with Instructions from their respective States. A Letter from Mr Chittendon and others,(2) stiling themselves \""the Governor and Executive Council of the State of  SEPTEMBER 15, 1780  Vermont,\"" was sent in by their Agents now in this City, claiming the Rights and Sovereignty of an Independent State, and refusing to submit the Question of their Independence to Congress as being incompetent to judge and determine thereon. As there was no Question proposd, a Conversation rather than a Debate ensued, which ended with a Call for an Adjournment at the usual Hour. This Day a Letter was sent into the President from the Agents of Vermont,(3) praying that in Case any Question should be agitated concerning the Rights and Independency of their State, they might be admitted to be present and hear the Debates. Another Conversation was begun which was very soon interrupted by a Call of the Attention of the House to the present State and Circumstances of the Army.(4) I am of opinion that Congress will not easily agree on the Question proper to be first put, however obvious it may seem to be. This is one among a Thousand other Affairs, with which it is the Fate of Congress to be plagud to the Exclusion of Considerations of infinitely greater Consequence and which require immediate Attention. As an Individual, I wish most heartily, that it could subside, as things of much greater Moment too generally do, \""till a more convenient Season\"". But New York presses hard for a Decision, and I submit to your Judgment, whether it would not be prudent, that the Claims of Massachusetts to the Lands in Question should be here in Readiness, lest a Construction should be put on a further Delay, that a Consciousness in the Assembly, of the States having no Right in them is the real Occasion of it. I mention this to you in particular, because I recollect how far you had gone in investigating the Title; and do not think I mean to flatter when I add, that if you can be spared from the Assembly, I hope you will be appointed to vindicate the Claim.  I just now told you that the Attention of Congress was called to the Army. General Washington has written several Letters acquainting Congress of the distressed Circumstances of the Army for Want of Provisions and particularly Meat.(5) They have at several Times lately been without Provisions for three or four Days. They have even plunderd the Neighboring Villages, and what will be the Consequence of such a Spirit in our Army, should it prevail, may be easily conceivd. You are sensible that the Dependence is chiefly on the Eastern States for that Kind of Supplys, Massachusetts has indeed been more punctual than the rest. The Commissary General has told me that the very Existence of the Army has been in a great Measure owing to the Industry and Care of our Committee at Springfield. Yet even our Supplies have not been equal to Expectation. 597 Head of Cattle have been sent from Massachusetts to the Army from the first of July to the seventh of September-about 200 to the Posts at the Northward, and about 200 to the french Army, which last are not included in the Supply required as our Quota. Congress have pressingly called upon N Hampshire, Massachusetts and  Connecticut for one thousand Head weekly, less than which will not be more than sufficient for the immediate Demands of the Army. Our Quota is 385, as you will see by a Resolution forwarded by this Express.(6) Besides which, Magazines must be laid up this Winter for the Army next year. Indeed my Friend, we must make the utmost Exertions in this great Cause. It is now twelve o Clock and the Express will set off very early in the Morning. I suppose our Countrymen have before this time made Choice of their Senators and Magistrates. I hope Heaven has directed them to a Choice that will do them Honor. I cannot help feeling anxious to know whether they have united in a Man for their Governor, endowd with those Virtues which should be characteristick of their first Magistrates. Be pleasd to let my much esteemd Friend Doctor Cooper know that if he has written, I have not receivd a Line from him since I left Boston. We suffer for Want of such favors. In hopes of receiving one from you very soon I remain very affectionately, yours Sam Adams  ""

Congress upon mature Deliberation under present Circumstances could not devise any other Measures than those adopted by the Act enclosed to supply the Army for the present Campaign; and should either of the States fail substantially to comply with this requisition it is more than probable the Army must disband, or supply themselves at the Point of the Bayonet, and the most fatal Consequences must insue.

  My Dear sir, Philadelphia Septr. 15. 1780 I had the pleasure of receiving your favor of the 9th inst. by Dr. Craig, two days ago.  There is a New arrangment for the Medical department now before Congress, & nearly compleated, by which there will be a very great reduction of Officers. By the new System there will be fifteen principal Officers to be elected by Congress, which I apprehend will be but too much influenced by that spirit which has given a well grounded alarm to the Gentlemen concerned.(1) Evidently to evince how far such a disposition has already operated, The new Q.M. G. is allowed to hold his commission at the Board of War, in direct violation of a law of Congress, & which has been uniformly practised upon, (except a few instances of no importance) but to suffer a man to hold two Commissions of the first consequence under the United States, savors so strongly of an outrageous partiality, that I shall be surprised at nothing, that may hereafter happen.  I have the pleasure of being acquainted with most of the Gentlemen mentioned by Yr. Excellency and know their worth, and no endeavours shall be wanting on my part to promote their reestablishment, but I fear it will not be in my power to do them much service, for I find there is a decided party formed against the Committee that were at Camp, which I have reason seriously to dread, will be productive of no good to our public affairs. I owe much to the public but still I owe something to myself, & can never tamely suffer a set of miscreants to tryumph over me with impunity. Regardless of our Characters as members of their own body, I find we are to be considered as Qr. Masters &c. & lyable to equal insults, without the least pretentions to call such conduct in question, but I can assure them they will find me of a temper by no means calculated to answer their new fangled Dogmas.  Although I had heard a good deal & seen something of the rancour of these Demogogues yet I never imagined it had risen to that height, I was made to feel it had done, on my resuming my seat in Congress. I took the first opportunity, Of going very largely into the State of our affairs, in order to found some propositions, which I made, but without allowing them to be worthy of a commitment, much less of their consideration, they were in the Lump rejected. (2) However I have this consolation, to reflect, they were approved by those, whose disinterestness, & Judgment, I have the best opinion of. Such an insult I never saw offered to any member of Congress before. It shews such a determined, & premeditated prejudice, as must inevitably lay me under the necessity of doing what I would wish most earnestly to avoid. I beg your pardon, sir, for detaining you so long on a subject  SEPTEMBER 15, 1780  relative to myself, but as my plan (above mentioned) was for the establishment of a permanent army, & the means of supporting the War, I thought it a subject you were so much interested in that it would not be unacceptable to you to know the result of my endeavours, & how little prospect I have of being farther useful to this end, for I suppose any future propositions of mine, will be immediately exploded, \""as too strongly tinctured with those Army principles, which I had imbibed, whilst with them. \"" I cannot but think it hard, that a man who wishes to be useful, should be thus unjustly precluded from being so; however, I know the rectitude of my intentions, & can at all times retire to my own bosom for my justification, & whilst that monitor supports me, I shall continue to act my part, regardless of every contentious spirit.  Your Excellency's letter of the 20 Ulto. has now been twenty four days in the hands of a Committee, I have repeatedly called for a report from them, but, by what I can find, little or nothing has been yet done upon it.(3) This does not at all surprize me, & I dare say by the time the Committee, & Congress have done with it, the time will arrive, when the army ought to be in the field. This ruinous delay I wanted to prevent, by Congress taking up my propositions in the first instance, but by their not doing it, I may readily conclude, it militated too much against the plan they have in contemplation, & therefore, further conclude, it will not be such a one, as will in it's operation, be effectual. This may look like arrogating too much to myself, but the event will prove, whether I am right, or not.  I have the honor to be, with the highest respect & Esteem, Yr. Excys most Obedt. serv., Jno.

General Foulsom & myself have opposed this & urged the appointment of Commisioners in the first Instance, both upon principles of policy, & upon a Conviction of the want of power in Congress To take any other Steps agreable to the Articles of Confederation.  I Last Evening received Letters from Several Persons of Note in that Quarter & the adjacent Parts of New Hampr Expressive of the Sentiments of the people assuring me that a Division of the grants will be Disagreable to all; That if Congress are Determined they Shall not be Independant Seven Eighths of them will Petition Congress to Reunite them to New Hampr. Colo Alcott (2) of Vermont waited on me & assured me that this was the General Sentiment of the People. I Shall therefore be Less violent in my opposition to that Question in future. I am Exceeding happy to find that New York have appointed three Gentlemen (3) of high Spirits & all Deeply Interested in the Event To appear as agents for that State breathing out nothing but Death & Slaughter against those people who have So Long Set their authority at Defiance & painting the Bitter Enmity which they have Ever Discovered against the Yorkers. To this I have Endeavored to oppose the moderate Spirit of New Hampshire; her readiness to Acquiese in the Determination of Congress & Even though the Land is Clearly within her Limits to Submit to its being a Seperate State if Congress Should find it for The good of the whole. I have assisted the Yorkers in Establishing the Fact of an utter aversion in those people to Live under their Jurisdiction; & at the Same time have taken Care to mention the Harmony which has Ever Subsisted between them & New Hampshire. This I find is Likely to have the Effect Intended. The Members begin to See that If the Lands are adjudged to New York the Continent must be Involved in a war to Inforce the Determination of Congress which Can only be avoided by adjudging it to New Hampr. & I am Convinced this will finally Turn the Scale in favor of New Hampshire.(4) I wish to have forwarded to me as Soon as possible one of the New Hampshire Law Books in which is Governor Wentworths Commission as the Secretary has only furnished me with an Extract from it without Date. I am Indeed ashamed of the papers furnished from New Hampshire & hope for Success rather from Political Considerations than from any other motive. A material paper is the prohibition to the Governor of New York in 1767 to Exercise Jurisdiction or grant Lands in that Territory. This I cannot obtain. New York agents are possessed of but will not produce it. I apprehend it must be in the Secretarys office; the Several papers which I wrote for when at Home or Such of them as can be procured ought to be forwarded. The Southern Members are as Ignorant of the History of New England as we are of the Lands under the Poles. I procured Some useful papers in Connecticut & hope to  obtain more before the final Tryal. I Shall also be glad of Every Evidence that New Hampshire can furnish; & of their Instruction from time to time.  We have nothing new Since Genl. Gates's Defeat. I have Seen a private Letter from Genl. Smallwood giving a particular Account of the Action. The Loss on our Side was about two hundred, the Enemys five hundred, the Brave Marylanders after being Deserted by the Militia & the Commander in Chief performed wonders, & Retired with Regularity. General Smallwood had not heard of General Gates when he wrote as he had retired 200 miles from the place of Action before he wrote the Letter which So much frightened those who believed it of which I never was in the number. We have this Day recd. Intelligence from New York that the Second Division of the French Fleet is on the Coast. I rejoice that Genl Washington gives New Hampshire Credit for Complying with the requisitions of Congress better than any other State. I wish her to Continue her Exertions as the Army is Literally Starving & I fear will Disband. We are using Every Exertion to Remedy the Evils which Surround us, but it is a very Late Hour for the Business, though I hope not too Late.  I have the honor to be most respectfully, Dear Sir Your most obedt Servt. Jno Sullivan  ""

  My Dear sir, Philadelphia September 18th 1780 This day I had the pleasure of receiving yours of the fifteenth, inclosing 365 Dollars. The Bundle of money which you was so very Kind as to procure for me I received. It Came in good time, but will not last long in this most Expensive place, and therefore must beg the favour of you to procure Some more for me, as soon as you Can, it must be of the old Continental money. The new will not pass here. Have been with the Coach maker. He has promised your chariot, Shall be finished by the last Week in October.  Our Army Continues much distressed for want of Meat. They get one meal only in three days, and how long that Scanty Allowance will Continue, is uncertain. The Jersey Inhabitants, in whose State the Army is, are plundered daily by partys from the Army, without a possibility of restraint, are not the worst of Consequences to be dreaded, from the Armys thus Careing for themselves-may it not be expected that even the people of the Jerseys, who have upon all Occasions exerted themselves in Support of the Common Cause, will at length have their affections Alienated from the Army, & look upon them as plunderers, and Enemies, rather than the protectors of their Rights. Is it not most Shameful that our Army Should be Starving, while the Country abounds with provisions? To what Can it be imputed? Is it from a want of inclination in the States, to Comply with what has been repeatedly required of them by Congress? Or is it from inattention to the public Cause, or inabillity to render the necessary Supplies? I hope neither of these is the Case. Satisfied I am, that our resources are abundantly Sufficient, and that the bulk of the people Continue firm in the opposition-from the disjointed and deranged State of our finances proceed all our embarrassments, and how to extricate ourselves is the difficulty. There Seems to be a fatality attending every measure, that has been adopted for that purpose. The most probable Schemes have by Some means or other been rendered ineffectual. The Resolves of the 18h March promised fair, but am afraid Will not Answer the end proposed. How is the old money to be got in and the new put into Circulation while our Taxes are Anticipated and paid of in Certificates? Our present Situation is truly Alarming. Our Army in want of every thing; no money in the Treasury and our Credit Exausted.  Congress had advice today of the Arrival of Admiral Rodney at the Hook on the 13th,(1) with twelve Ships of the line, And four frigates, and that they had taken & brought in with them a french frigate- that 5000 Troops were to be Sent from N.Y. to the Southward. It is reported that the Combined fleets from the West Indias is on the Coast-if so the french will be Superior and may put a Stop to the  SEPTEMBER 18, 1780  embarkation at New York. Fryday last General Smallwood was by the unanimous Vote of Congress promoted to the Rank of Major General. Am Sorry to Acquaint you that this Morning dyed much lamented Mrs. Reed the Presidents Lady.

  Dear Sir, Morristown. September 18th. 1780. Your agreable favor of the 6th instant came safe to hand the 8th. And I should have done myself the pleasure of acknowledging it much sooner, had it not been that I waited in hourly expectation to receive some intelligence from Mr. Matthews which might be worth your reading, but alass! I am disappointed, for tho' he has wrote me Several letters, he has omitted giving me the information I wish to obtain. (1)  Nothing in my present situation, except seeing and conversing with my friends, could be more agreable than receiving letters from them, and give me leave to assure you, Sir, there is not one among the few I dare at this day call friends, whose correspondence I should higher value, or whose letters would be more eagerly and gratefully embrac'd, than those you shall at any time favor me with.  The very polite and affectionate manner, in which you have express'd your wishes, respecting my health, and welfare, cannot fail to impress on a generous mind indelible sentiments of friendship, and excite grateful returns.  When with horror I contemplate the ill timed, and worse calculated revolutions, alluded to in your letter, the convulsions they must occasion, and the train of distressing embarrassments that will consequently result therefrom, I am overwhelm'd with astonishment, and fill'd with holy indignation at the paracidical conduct of the authors. That \""thing\"" for conducting your late department (2) appear'd in bye corners, and your letter of resignation thereupon sent to congress before I left camp. And I have the Satisfaction of reflecting, that I then fully join'd with my colleagues, in representing to congress, the probable consequences of your resignation, and of making a change of men or measures at so late a period in the campaign, and have shar'd largely in the honor of being censured for giving our sentiments upon the subject. And have to regret our sentiments had not then been more fully expressed, in language emphatical, as the subject is important, which would then, as now, satiated my mind.  When with a distress'd army, and injured country, I condole the loss of your abilities in the Q.M. Generals department, At the same time I do most cordially congratulate you as a friend, a Gentleman, and a general in our army, on the happy occasion of your being freed from an office, the duties of which you had faithfully discharged, with so much toil and fatigue, and which had ended in discontent and unmerited disgrace. But let me add I feel a degree of solace in reflecting that the rancour of our enemies, the enemies of our country, promp'd them no farther.  The whole of the late conduct of C____ss relative to you, Sir, and to the committee, had it appear'd in any other age than the present,  SEPTEMBER 18, 1780  or in any other body of men than those who resort together in Chestnut street Philadelphia. It would have been a Phaenomenon astonishing to all who beheld it.  However, I can assure you, Sir, that the favorable opinion you imagine the Gentlemen of the army have conceived of the well meant instructions of the committee, will ever be esteemed a gratefull over ballance, for all the ill treatment they have, or may experience from any other body of men.  As to the Gentleman who is to succeed you as Q. M. General, (3) his character as a private gentleman, and as a lawyer, was good. And I most sincerely wish his abilities, and exertions, on the present occasion may prove competent for the important purposes of his appointment.  And if we may judge of future events by past occurrances-The Manner in which he executed the office of adjutant Genl. while in that department-The rapid and decisive movements he has made since his present appointment, leaves us no room to doubt but his piercing eye will run to & fro through the department, beholding the good, and the evil, that is done in it. That his Systematic nod will alone be Sufficient to put the whole machine, instantly, in motion. In fine that he will take up the complex business of the department as a very little thing.  Our Southern affairs at present wear an unfavorable aspect, but wish they may soon put on a different complexion, for I must here observe that my opinion of Gen ____(4) is not at all lesson'd by what has happen'd at the southward, since his command there, unless on examination it should prove that he had been guilty of treachery to his country, or temerity in his operations against the Enemy, neither of which have I ever had the least reason to suspect he could be guilty of, from my first acquaintance with him even unto this day.  Though my health has for some time been a little upon the advance yet I am like Issachar (5) Of old crouching down under complicated burthens-for the hand of God hath touched me so, that my bodily indisposition has alone been enough for me to grapple with, and has rendered me less capable, than I otherwise should have been, of enduring the gloomy prospect of a distressed, if not a disbanded Army, a cause which has cost us such a deluge of blood, and immense treasures, put to the hazard, if not, totally lost! The beautiful, once virtuous Virgin America deflowered, and sinking under the weight of measures adopted, and pursued by her degenerate sons, who have been dandled in her lap, nurtured in her bosom, wantonly rioted upon her choicest fruits, and shar'd her highest confidence. Add to all this, my being under the Iron hand of powerful men, whose tender mercies are cruelty, but great as their power is, it by no means equals their malevolence, otherwise no honest man could abide the day of their wrath.  Was it necessary for a scapegoat, and the committee would in the present case answer as a substitute, so far as it respects me, I have nothing in reserve but my honor and integrity.  But do you imagine a sacrifice of three men only, could by any means expiate the sins of those who have begun to crucify them, for no other fault than speaking the truth, and endeavoring upon just principles to promote the salvation of a distress'd sinking country?  Though I should highly esteem the good will and opinion of Congress, and should place the approbation of my fellow citizens, amongst my choicest treasures, yet neither the powers, or the flattery of the former, nor the expectation of applause from the latter, or any consideration whatever shall, in any circumstances of life, enduce me to censure, or approve men, or measures, contrary to my real sentiments .  You mention something of publishing & it is just, it is a duty, you will one day owe to yourself, and to your country; but not yet my friend.  For if torture, ever extorted words from the dumb, I should imagine the unmerited, cruel, and infernal treatment honest men receive, from those who ought to be their supporters, would fully justify many others, beside you and me, in undeceiving the public by representing men, and facts in their true colours, to the people at large. But that unbounded love for my country, which at first induced me to forsake all and follow her cause, now loudly forbids my taking any measures, even in defence of that, which ought to be higher valued than life itself, that might have a tendency to cause greater Jealousies among the people at large at this critical period, and till the close of this campaign-for it is better for one, two, or three, or even an hundred honest men to suffer for a time, than to involve the country in greater distress.  If it had been an open avowed enemy that had done all this wickedness, I could have borne it, but it was my brethren, sons of America, brought up with me, which makes it intolerable, and tho' I shall not quickly pursue, yet if I finally forget the treatment, may my right hand forget her cunning.  And for the present shall be so far from cursing those, mine adversaries, that I have a blessing in store for them, even for them, who ought to be damn'd for their ingratitude, and lest I should err in pronouncing my benedictions, I will do it in the pathetic words of good old father Jacob to his beloved sons Simeon & Levi, which may be seen at large, Genesis 49:5, 6 & 7th varying only so as to make it applicable to the persons and country. But lest you should be put to trouble in procuring a book, that will give an Idea of the matter, I will write the quotation \""Simeon & Levi are brethren: instruments of cruelty are in their habitations. O! my soul come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honor be not thou   united; for in their anger they slew a man, and in their self will they digged down a wall, Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce, and their wrath for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and Scatter them in Israel.\""  Good men have always spies upon their conduct. Several of my letters of correspondence written in that unguarded manner, in which a man is wont to unbosom himself to his friends, especially when in haste, have of late been intercepted, and either kept from the persons to whom they were address'd, or copied and given off in detach'd sentences, which among enemies operate to my prejudice; On the 6th of last month I wrote a letter which has shar'd the same fate, (6) and by an Anonymous letter I lately received, find my enemies have by some means or other obtain'd a partial copy thereof in Philadelphia, before it could have reach'd the Gentleman to whom it was directed. And you may soon expect to see some very spirited resolutions upon the daring performance. Lest by misrepresentation you should be prepossess'd of an opinion that the letter contains sentiments unwarrantable in themselves, and prejudicial to the publick, I take the liberty of inclosing you a copy, with all blunders, imperfections, treasons and political heresies, therein contain'd, without the least amendment or alteration, that you may judge for yourself what ought to be my doom, for what is written, is written, and I neither Shall, or wish to, say a single word, if nothing more is done about the matter, I trust you will not use the letter to my prejudice, I dont mean as to the sentiments it contains, for I will avow them to my last breath, but only that my enemies need not know that I had sent a copy, and made known the matter, to you.  Upon looking over the committees papers, dont find the copy of your letter of resignation to congress, which ought to be in our report. I should be very much oblig'd, if you will furnish me a copy by the first express, as our letters to congress mention the Subject.  The news here is that General Washington is gone to Rhode Island, that General Greene commands the army-that count De Guichen is arrived off Block Island-That Jemmy Rivington has congratulated his fellow Demons on the happy circumstance of admiral Rodney's arrival at the Hook, with ten sail of the line and other ships of force. You will judge of the probability that things are thus Situated.  I am, Dear Sir, With that truth, which becomes the noblest work of the Deity, Your Sincere friend, most Obedt. and very humble Servant. Nathl Peabody  ""

  Dear Sir Philadelphia September l9th. 1780. Your two letters of the 30th of August and 9th of Sepr. I have had the pleasure to receive.  That there have been and still are some members in Congress of a persecutting Spirit is not to be doubted or wondered at when we reflect that one of the best judges of Mankind choose only Twelve out of the whole lump, and one of his number was of that class. But to suppose that Congress take their tone from that Class appears to me rather censorious. And if we may Judge from their final determinations I think the Contrary will appear.  A change of measures in the QM Generals department was in some measure become necessary. Clamours run exceeding high against the department in general and wheither upon Just or unjust grounds made but little difference the clammour was gone forth and persons of Influence were not wanted to blow the Cole. At the same time I altogether reprobate the making any general chainge in either of the great departments of the Army during the time they are in the field let the plan be almost ever so bad, but as soon as the Army was gone into Winter Quarters I should have agreed most cordially to many of the Alterations that are made and should have thought some others necessary upon principals of expediteing the business as well as that of OEconomy.  People in different stations of life are apt to think indifferently of each other as they do not feel the force of the difficulties that attend the other. The Gentlemen of the Army feel the difficulties and hardships that they are exposed to with all the severity attending, and are perhaps too apt to suppose they arise from want of Attention in Congress or a wicked disposition to distress them when perhaps the real cause arose from a train of disappointments that no humane prudence could foresee. I have lived the life of a Soldier for five years and I can say upon the word of an honest man I never passed a Summer so disagreablely as I have the present. Every day furnishing a new Catelogue of Complaints from the Army and other publick Creditors with out the means of Satisfying them on one Side, On the other a Series of Letters from governors and presidents in answer to letters pressing the states for money seting forth the exhausted state of their several Treasurys and the inability of their consituents to pay the Quotas of Taxes assessed upon them. After all what shall Congress do, Curse the states as some of the gentlemen of the Army SEPTEMBER 19, 1780  do Congress for not fulfilling their contracts with them immediately when its out of their power. But after all I will go further and not only say that the members of Congress are friends to their Country but far the greatest part of them have the highest opinion of the officers in the Army and are their real friends. I can only lament that the gentlemen of the Army are not fully acquainted with the sentiments and Conduct of Congress towards them with every difficulty and obstruction they meet with when endeavouring to serve them in such a manner as to make the Army Comfortable, I am sure their candor is such that many prejudices would be removed that now exist.  The affair of General Gates defeat or rather flight rests very easy in Congress at present but I beleive the day is not far distant when some hard things will be said of the old Gentleman which will amount to a coldness in Congress towards him if not a recall or Suspension. I trust before this will reach you every matter of Intelegence I can give will reach the Army.  The Southern delegates had moved in Congress that Major Lee Might be sent to the southward before I received your letter, the Motion was refered to general Washington who hath since by his letter of the 16th Instant acquainted Congress he thought it inexpedient to detach him. As that is the Case I must beg to be excused from making any motion in Congress for that purpose.  I believe the ill nature that appeard upon your refusing to act as QMG is nearly exhausted at the same time I suppose the seeds yet remain among the gatoneans who upon an Occassion that suited their purpose would not be wanting to give your Carrector a fatal stabb. But when I consider their insignificancy as to Number, and that knowledg of mankind that you possess, I am Confident you will be able to keep out of their power untill fortune shall throw something in your way by which you can take advantage so as to put your self intirely out of their power to give you the least uneasyness.  Congress have in contimplation the arraingment of the Army. A Committee have been appointed and have reported a plan which is not yet considered.(1) The plan is for raising an Army of 32,000 Non Commissioned officers and privates to be thrown into four Regts. of Cavelry, four of Artilery, Forty nine of Infantry, and one of Artificers to be officered by the officers now in service as the several states shall direct which is to be whole regular force of these United States each state to Inlist there Quota if possible for the War or for three years by the first of December next if not to compleat their Quotas by drafts so as to have their full compliment in the field by the first day of Jany. next at furthest. All Regts. and Corps to be reduced except as above on the said first day of Jany. As a Considerable Number of officers will be reduced I wish your opinion as to the mode upon which in justice they ought to retire. It is further proposed to Incorporate all the foreigners both Horse and foot into   One additional Corps to be called the Legion the Command to be given to Colo. Hazen the other officers to be appointed by the Commander in chief. The plan for reducing the Regts. is in my opinion absolutely necessary upon principals of Oeconomy. It appears to me no nation on earth ever had more need of Oeconomy then we and made use of less. At the rate our affairs are now Carrying on from north to South Civil as well as Military all the Mines of Peru would be insufficient to defray the current expences. I hope you will not conclude from this that I wish to distress or injure the Army it is the Contrary I wish to put them upon a footing that the states may be both able to Subsist and pay them. You are too well acquainted with the abilitys of these states to need any arguments to convince you of their Inability to pay Annually 16,000,000 of Specie dollars which I can asure you is the least sum that will pay the expence of the Militia in the southern Army that I fear will be accumilated. We must immediately get a regular force in the field and some better mod of supplying of them then the present or our independance will fail us. The want of money seems at present be the cause of our greatest difficultys and principal distress.  But at a time when we seem to be surrounded with difficulties on every side and aught to be exerting our joynt efforts to extricate ourselves and if possible prevent impending ruin We are wasting our time day after day in hearing the Yorkers dispute about the Independance of Vermont which hath taken up our whole time since last Tuesday Morning and we are no nearer a conclusion that I can see then when we began. I fear our doing the things we aught not and leaving the things undone that we aught to attent to will er[e] long be attended with fatal Consequencies & prove our Ruin.  I would have wrote you more fully in regard to your standing in point of favour with Congress. But they are so fickle in point of opinion in regard to the officers of the Army I am afeard I shall deceive you. But thus much I think I may say that you stand foremost in the line of Major Generals in their good graces since the exceeding hard ride General Gates had between the 16th and 20th of August which is a most mortifing stroke to the gentlemen from Massachusetts and some others tho I think they do not yet sufficiently realize their Mortification. A proper oppertunity is only waited for when Justice will be done which never fail to make the Tools of Wickedness shudder. And should a Major General be detached to releive General Gates while I think is not impossible I beleive you would be the man. Some of the Members are exceeding uneasy that the old gentleman is suffered to hold his Command. A certain gentleman of Carrector in Maryland writes that he thinks Genl St. Clair aught to Superceed him.  As to our affairs to the southard there is at present no fixed mode agreed upon, Congress have only recommended to the Legislatures  of Virginea and North Carolina to use their utmost exertions to raise and feed an Army merely by piece meal with out any fixed plan. And by a letter receivd yesterday from the governor of Virginia (2) it appears a faction in favour of the Britons had lately broke out in three or four of the back Countys of that state where they had been always heretofore considered friendly to these states. A very Considerable Number had Inlisted to joyn the Enemy but their plan was discovered and they were prevented. A letter came by the same hand from General Gates Informing that he had Intelegence, that Cornwallis was preparing to imbark his troops at George Town and go from thenc to cape Fare and then through the Country to Virginia and that he Cornwallis had parties out Collecting Waggons for that purpose And that four Thousand Troops from N York was to immediately take possession of Portsmouth in Virginia. How far this Intelegence is to be relyed on I cannot say. The old gentleman lays great stress upon it. But I thought sometimes last summer he was too fond of beleiving every story from the Enemy especially if it tended to distress us.

I do myself the honor to write your Excellency by this post; and am sorry to acquaint you that, notwithstanding public business of the most pressing nature is now suffering before Congress, we have spent three days to no purpose in the affair of Vermont, and are still engaged in the same business; and when we shall get clear of it I know. not, or what we shall do in the affair. The Yorkers treat the matter almost beyond the bound of modesty. I can only say I am sorry from my heart that Congress has taken up the matter, by their former resolution, in the manner they have And let us do what  SEPTEMBER 19, 1780  we will, I fear the most fatal consequences will follow I cannot give you particulars at this time.(1)  By intelligence from several quarters, it appears the enemy are preparing to push their operations to the southward by the taking possession of Portsmouth, with a body of troops from New York, while Cornwallis endeavors to join them from the southward.  Congress has in contemplation to raise an army of thirty-two thousand non-commissioned officers and privates, to be in the field by the first day of January next, at farthest, to serve one year at least, to consist of four regiments of cavalry, four of artillery, forty-nine of infantry, and one of artificers; the whole to be proportioned to the several states, and all the rest and residue of the regiments and corps to be reduced on the first day of January next. The above is the report of a committee which is not yet considered, and probably will undergo some alterations, but I think the substance will pass.(2)  Our loss of Continental troops in the late infamous flight on the 16th of August, near Camden, is very inconsiderable to what was expected from the tenure of Gen. Gates' letter of the 20th of August, from Hillsborough. Our people have retaken one hundred Continental prisoners, as the enemy were conducting them to Charleston.  I have the honor to be your Excellency's Most obedient, humble servant, Ezekiel Cornell.  Reprinted from Staples, Rhode Island, p. 313.

  Philadelphia l9th Septemr 1780 I long my dearest Polly most impatiently to hear of your own and our Childrens Health not having yet been blessed with a Line. Any Letters you favour me with will come safe by the Post. I have Reason to be thankful that I have not felt the least Indisposition since we parted and I want nothing but an assurance of your welfare to make me easy and resigned to the Station hard as it is to which my Country has appointed me. Indeed she wants all the Services of her Oldest Citizens, as our affairs are much perplexed for the Want of money.  The Enemy we learn are again in Motion. Where they will make their assault is uncertain. Some think they will reinforce Lord Cornwallis in South Carolina; others that they will attempt to make a Lodgement in Virginia. None suppose that further Attacks upon the State of New York are probable. The first point to be settled SEPTEMBER 19, 1780  seems to be the naval Superiority in the American Seas. If it is true that Sir George Rodney is at the Hook with ten Ships of the Line, and that the combined Fleets of France and Spain are on our Coast, an Engagement seems almost unavoidable as Monsieur De Turnay the French Admiral and his Squadron are shut up in Rhode Island and great Efforts will be undoubtedly made for his Relief. I enclose for your Amusement the news papers.  We this moment learn that Col. Mariot (1) of the South Carolina militia has retaken the whole of the Maryland Line who were made Prisoners in the late Battle near Cambden, together with their Guard, so that we have already recovered a Blow which from the first Accounts and misrepresentations made a disagreeable Impression.  If you have heard from Hughey let me know as I cannot Account for his Silence.  With my most dutiful & affectionate Regards to our parents and friends and my warmest Blessing to our dearest Children I am ever my dear Polly Your truly affectionate & ever faithful Husband.

  My dear General Philadelphia l9h Septemr 1780 I am to acknowledge the Honour of your Excellency's favour of the 9th Instant on the Subject of the Hospital Department.(1) Your Sollicitude that Gentlemen of distinguished Merit shoud be employed is a continued Proof of your Attention to the publick good; & those you particularize will not fail of being supported.  We are deeply engaged on the Subjects of your Excellency's several Letters, considerable Progress is made in that which is the principle- the raising a permanent Army.(2) Congress unite in Sentiment that it is essential that is the surest and the only mean of producing an honourable Peace: to render it practicable and certain is the difficulty. There is in my mind no Question but that it will be submited for your Opinion before it becomes conclusive.  I wish it was in my power to communicate agreeable Events to conterballance our Southern Misfortunes; the weight of them daily diminishes by a comparison of Facts with the hasty Information of the commanding officer of the Detachment. The Loss however of Artillery and Baggage, and above all of small Arms, must be severly felt, and the precipitate Flight of the militia expose us to Insult, after every Alleviation. Of one Comfort we cannot be deprived. Our  SEPTEMBER 19, 1780  regular Troops have acquired unfading Glory! I find with great Satisfaction that the Legislature of New York have fallen in with the Views of the Eastern Convention and particularly to strengthen the Hands of Congress and enable them to enforce their Decisions: We can never manage the publick Interests with Success till this Disposition becomes general: Nor can any thing else under the divine Blessing, be necessary to give Us a decided Superiority over our Enemies. We have now obtaind military Knowledge in an eminent Degree, we have internal Resources and Reputation abroad: we have a great and respectable Ally: of what then are we destitute but Vigour and Confidence in Government, and publick Spirit in Individuals.  I shall be happy to be honourd with a Line after your Interview at Hartford if your Leisure admit.(3) I hope it will prove some Relaxation from the severe and anxious Cares which have fallen to your Share too long and with too much Weight. Permit me to add that I am with every Sentiment of the most affectionate Attachment and most perfect Regard, Dear Sir, your most Obedient humble Servant,  Jas. Duane  ""

  Dear Doct. Philadelphia Sept. l9th 1780. I this moment received your two letters of the 3d and 9th Instant which I read with Satisfaction, all but the Account you have given of Janeys (1) health which is very distressing. You will let me Know by every post how She goes on. I wrote you by Mr. Pool giving you an Account of the Defeat of our Southern Army. The Accounts we have Since had from that quarter is more favourable than Could be expected Considering the Situation in which Gen. Gates left them, from the best Intelligence we have, not more than two hundred of the Regulars are missing. Our Army is Still much distressd for want of meat. They get one meal only in three days, and how long that Scanty allowance will Continue is uncertain.  The Jersey Inhabitants in whose State the Army is, are plundered daily by partys of the Army, without a possibility of restraint-are not the worst of Consequences to be dreaded from the Armys thus Careing for themselves? Will not the affections of those people who SEPTEMBER 19, 1780  have upon all Occasions Exerted themselves in Support of the Common Cause, be at length Alenated from the Army, and look upon them rather in the light of Robers and Enemies than the protectors of their rights? Is it not most Shameful that our Army Should be Starving and drove into Such measures, while the Country abounds with provisions? I am willing to believe that all our embarrassments proceed rather from the disjointed and deranged State of our finances, than the want of inclination or Ability in the united States to Carry on the War. Still I cant help thinking, that a want of proper Exertions in them, is in a great degree the Cause of the present distresses of the Army. Congress Can do no more than recommend-but as I observed before our difficulties principally arose from the want of money, and there Seems to be a fatality attending every measure that has been adopted to put our finances into order- the most probable Schemes have, by Some means or other been rendered ineffectual. The resolves of the 18th March promised fair, but am afraid will not answer the end proposed. How is the old money to be got in, and the new put into Circulation, while our Taxes are anticipated, and paid off with Certificates? Our present Situation is truly Alarming-the Army in want of every thing-no money in the Treasury, And our Credit Exausted. God grant us a Speedy, Safe and Honourable Peace.  Congress had advice to day of the Arrival of Admiral Rodney at the Hook with twelve Sail of the line and four frigates (2)-that they had taken and brought in with them, a french frigate-that 5000 Troops are to be Sent from new york to the Southward. It is reported And I hope with good foundation that the Combined fleet from the West Indias is on the Coast. If so the french will be Superior, And may prevent the embarkation at new york from taking place. Last fryday General Smallwood was by an unanimous vote of Congress promoted to the Rank of Major General, And in my Judgment ought to take the Command of the Southern Army at least that our runaway General ought to be Suspended And an Equiry made into His Conduct. Am Sorry to Acquaint you that yesterday Morning Dyed much lamented Mrs. Reed the Presidents Lady. It is now Just 12 oClock the time the Post is Setting out, must therefore Conclude With my most affectionate Love to Mrs Hanson And Janey, who I hope will take all possible Care of her Self, use Exercise, and Conform to every thing that may Contribute to restore her to health. My love to Sammy and the little ones, who I hope are well, tho you have said nothing about them. My Compliments to my neighbours and friends And let Mr Potts Know the necessary enquiry Shall be made. Jack Addisons is a mad Scheme, in my Opinion it will ruin him. I have wrote you a long letter in hast. I am now very well tho' have been much indisposed for a fortnight past. Farewell-Yrs. &c.(3)  ""

  My dear Sir, Phila. Sepr l9th 1780 I need not inform you of the difficulties Congress labour under for the want of Money, you are already Sensible of them but what makes this distress the more Melancholy is, that there is no immediate prospect of relief.  The New State Money of Penna. as well as the New Continental Emissions, is refused at Market, And what is extraordinary the Country people will not Sell for Gold, unless at exorbitt. prices; but seem to prefer the old Continental and Provisions for that Money are reasonable. Veal from 3 1/2 to 5 Dolls & Mutton from 4 to 5.  We have received information wch is not doubted, that Admiral Rodney with 12 Sail (11 of which of the Line) are arrived at New York. And it is immagined that the French Fleet & Troops at Rhode Island are the Object in view.  Two days have been taken up in debating How far Congress will allow Virga. &c. to hold Back Lands,(1) with Endemnity of Expenses for Conquered Territory. That business is not yet compleatly finished, but I think it premature, others have thought the measure would accelerate the Confederation. I think that it will rather retard it.  I understand that the New England States are to have a Congress soon to which they have invited New York to send Deputys. What this will End in a little time will discover. Pray inform me when you think the Assembly will meet.  With my respectful Compliments to Mrs. Lee, I am, Dr Sir Your affectionate Servt. Daniel of St Thos. Jenifer (2) P.S.

The danger of such a measure is too  SEPTEMBER 19, 1780  obvious not to deter them from it. It is given out at N. York that a reinforcement of 4000 troops are expected next month from England.  Yesterday was employed by Congress in discussing the resolutions you left with them. (1) The first & second were passed after undergoing sundry alterations. The clause in the 2d for allowing the expence of maintaining civil govt within the ceded territory was struck out by the committee, and an attempt to get it reinserted in the house was negatived. It was surmised that so indefinite an expression might subject Congress to very exorbitant claims. With respect to Virga. I believe that expence has not been so considerable as to be much worth insisting on. The principal expences may properly be included under the military head. The consideration of the last resolution annulling Indian purchases was postponed, with an intention I believe of not resuming it. It is supposed by some to be unnecessary, by others to be improper, as implying that without such previous assurance Congress would have a right to recognize private claims in a territory expressly given up to them for the common benefit. These motives prevailed I am persuaded with more than the real view of gratifying private interest at the public expence. The States may annex what conditions they please to their cessions, and by that means guard them agst. misapplication, or if they only annul all pretended purchases by their own laws before the cessions are made Congress are sufficiently precluded by their general assurance that they shall be applied to the common benefit from admiting any private claims which are opposed to it.  The Vermont business has been two days under agitation and nothing done in it except rejecting a proposition for postponing the determination of Congress till Commissioners should enquire into the titles & boundaries of N. Hampshire & N York. Congress have bound themselves so strongly by their own act to bring it to an issue at this time and are pressed by N. York so closely with this engagement, that it is not possible any longer to try evasive expedients. For my own part if a final decision must take place, I am clearly of opinion that it ought to be made on principles that will effectually discountenance the erection of new Governments without the sanction of proper Authority, and in a style marking a due firmness and dicision in Congress.  With sincere regard I am Dr. Sir, Yr. friend & Servt.  J . Madison Junr.  ""

  Dear Sir Philada. Sepr. l9th. 1780  I was in hopes when I wrote my last that I should be able by this post to congratulate you on the arrival of the french fleet from the W.

It is still said however that a french fleet is somewhere on the coast. The arrival of Rodney is certainly an evidence that it had quited the Islands and was suspected to be coming hither. It is also given out at New York that a reinforcement of 4000 troops will arrive next month from England. Another part of our reports is that 5 or 6000 troops will embark at N.

  My dear & ever honourd Sir, Philadelphia 20th Septemr 1780 I make it a Rule to miss no opportunity of writing to you or my Polly; to both I have it not always in my power, and I wish you may consider what I address to her as equally intended for your own perusal. The News papers, to one or other, I shall forward by every opportunity.  Our Loss of Men in the late General Engagement in South Carolina, tho' from General Gates's Account it appeard to be total, turns out inconsiderable: the Prisoners of the Maryland Line having been fortunately retaken. It may however be set down as a misfortune of considerable Extent as the Army then collecting for the Relief of South Carolina was dispersed, some of the Cannon taken, and the Militia much disgraced. Had they stood firm it is plain, from every Circumstance, that the Victory on our side woud have been decisive. A respectable Army is again collecting and will soon be ready to take the Field. The gallant Maryland Corps is reinforced by 500 Recruits of that Line, so that they will be much more formidable than before the late action in which they gave proof of Valour & Discipline scarcely to be paralleled.  Admiral Rodney is arrived at the Hook with 8 or 10 Ships of the Line; and the combined fleet of France & Spain expected on the Coast. A naval Engagement therefore is not improbable. In the mean time great Embarkation is making at New York, it is said for Virginia; & that Sir Henry has invited the disaffected Refugee families of that State & Maryland to accompany him.  The armed Neutrality for the freedom of Navigation may produce serious Effects. England declines the Claims of and Regulations of the Empress And the States declare that they will have Satisfaction for the Insult offerd to Count Byland their Admiral totally rejecting the Justification of that Transaction as explaind in the British Memorial.  I continue to enjoy my Health but am most anxious to hear of that of my Polly and the Families of the Manshion from any of whom I have not a Line since my arrival.  Will you be so good as to advise with Brother John respecting the disposal of my young Horses. The black Horse if at a moderate Expence I shoud like to keep to ride, the Mares maybe sold, for they do not answer Expectation not at all matching; and I cannot at present SEPTEMBER 20, 1780  bear the Charge of keeping them at Livery another year. Hugh Keeler might have put the Mares out for me even at a profit: but his unaccounted neglect of the Appointment to meet me at the Manour before I was obliged to repair to Congress, has prevented my taking the necessary Measures with this or any other of my affairs under his Care. The Inconveniences I feel as I had expected some Money for the Support of myself & Family. If Higley has not been yet at the Manour and paid the Amount of a note for £26 due about this time from one in Collyrbask be so good as to take it from my file of bonds and enclose it in a Line to Mr John Cuyler at Schenectade with my request that he will be so kind as to receive the money.  Our State I find have reelected me for the Ensuing year as one of their Delegates. They have however not sent me a penny for my support which is beyond Measure expensive: my bare board for bed & bread and meat (without drink, washing, horsehoofing or any other Charge) being four pounds Specie a week. As I am exhausted and cannot think it Just that you shoud maintain me here while I am in the publick service; I have writen plainly to the Governour that unless speedily supplied with money we must from Necessity break up the Delegation.(1) Indeed I have no more than enough to hold out another week, & repair my Sulky (which unfortunately broke down on the Journey here and will not be put in order under 1600 dollars) and to carry me home. Next Tuesday's post will probably produce an Answer from the State.  I can't recollect the name of the Man who owes me the money on Note; but in the last Journal of business at Duanesburgh there is a Memorandum. It is for my large black mare. The note is one of the first on the files. Excuse this trouble. Present my affectionate Regards to Mamma and every branch of the Family, and my blessings to my Children.

  Sir, Philada. 21 September 1780 It is with regret I intrude an Application in which my own particular Interest is a leading motive. Some months ago I determined to settle myself in Trenton for the insuing winter, and lately, Mr. Clarke and Mr Fell being both at Congress, I went home for that Purpose; but have been disappointed in effecting it so soon as I hoped. Mr. Clarke being in ill Health, and desirous to visit his Family, I was obliged to return and postpone it. Sickness has confined him, it is uncertain when he will be able to go, and in any Event he cannot be expected to return before the latter End of next Month. I am exceedingly embarrassed; I cannot think of leaving the State unrepresented, and yet it is of the most pressing Necessity that ten Days or a Fortnight from this Date at farthest, I should be at Home. I could not expect to succeed were I to request Leave of Absence from the Joint-meeting as the State would be left without a Vote, and therefore am compelled to mention the Alternative, that they would consider of appointing an additional Delegate, either to serve for the ensuing Year, or, if that will not comport with the Election law or is, for other reasons, disapproved, to serve till the first Day  SEPTEMBER 21, 1780  of December next, when the ensuing Delegation will commence. Perhaps the Empowering of one to give the Vote of the State for the remainder of the Year would be preferred; I only mention it. I would have requested that a Member might be appointed in my room, and myself no longer continued in the Delegation, but that the Time is not long, and I would not wish, by any Act of my own, to shew an Inclination to retire wholly from Congress at this Time of Difficulty. Were I to be thought of in the Appointment for the ensuing Year, my Reasons for declining would be instantly conclusive to every Body.  In Addition to what is said above, I beg Leave further to remark; if it so happens that none of the present Delegates are in the appointment next year, the Gentlemen who then attend will find themselves much at a Loss, be their abilities what they may, and the Interests of the State may possibly suffer in some Point where a little Experience of any one Member, would secure it. With a View to Cases of this Nature, some of the States appoint their Members at two different Periods in the Year, six Months or thereabouts distant from each other, one Half at one the other at the other, that should a total Change take Place at either, they may not still be without one or more in Congress to whom the Routine of Business is familiar.  I submit this Matter without further Explanation except that should Objections occur, it is my Wish no Concerns of mine, however near or interesting, may interfere with the essential Business of the State, or take up the Time of it's representatives.(1) I am, Sir, your obedient humble Servant,  Wm Churchill Houston ""

  My Dear sir, Philadelphia Septr. 24th. 1780 I did myself the pleasure of writing to you a few days ago by The Minister of France:(1) since which time, the Committee have brought in a partial report on the affairs of the army. It has been acted upon by Congress, & thus far agreed to.(2) To call on the States for an army of 32,000 men, to be in the field by the 1st day of January next. To reduce the remaining sixteen battalions, & all the light corps, & add them to state lines, so as to have no more than forty nine SEPTEMBER 24, 1780  battalions, & out of the horse, to reestablish four regiments. The infantry to consist of 580 privates, & the horse 320. The remaining 2300 to compose the artillery. The battalions of Infantry, Artillery, & horse, are quota'd on the several States, & the reduction, incorporation, & filling them up, submitted to them altogether. The mode recommended for engaging the men is, either for the war, or one year, & on the first day of every September the states are to be informed of the Deficiencies of their quotas of men in order that they may fill them up by the 1st of January. I stretched my abilities to their utmost extent, I exhausted every argument that nature, & my enquiries, & observations on this truely important subject, had furnished me with, to get the fatal alternative, \""or, for one year\"" altere'd thus-That if the battalions could not be compleated by the 1st day of Decr. for the War, then, (the States to be called in the most forcible language) to fill them up by drafts for not less than one year, from the 1st of Jany., but if not then relieved, to be obliged to continue in the field untill such time as their places shall be actually supplied, by other drafts or enlistments for one year, or for the War. The Commander in Chief to be empow[er]ed to discharge from time to time, such of the men as he shall think proper, as their places shall be by others supplied. By this mode, whatever numbers are once fixed on, and got into the field, we should be certain of always having a permanent army & no longer be subject to the caprice, and intolerable delays, supineness, & negligence of the states. There would be an indispensible obligation laid on the states to relieve their annual recruits, if they did not, the fault would lay with them, but we would have the men-undeminished-not as hitherto has been the case as soon as the times of the men expire, to be left at liberty to return home, & the army thus dwindle to a mere skeleton, & through the shameful neglect of the States, remain in this disgraceful situation, untill the season for operation is early expired. I think such a plan is also founded on principles of true policy: for, it would operate on the minds of the people especially of the monied men, as a matter in terrorem. As soon as they find themselves subject to a draft (not on the spurs of the occasion, but that it is become an established maxim, & to which they must be annually subjected,) it immediately becomes their interest, to devise some means by which they can avoid what they will conceive to be, a tremendous inconvenience. The mode readily enough suggests itself to them, which is, by classing the people, & each class to furnish a certain number of men. In each class, no doubt will be found a sufficient number of men, who will be ready to take a good bounty, rather than pay a heavy fine: and if they manage matters with prudence, by making the proper distinction in the bounties, between men for the war, & those only for one year, I dare say, most of the men may be got for the war: for the nature of man is such, that he is but too lyable to be influenced by the powers   of that inchanting metal called gold, & there will be one strong incentive to their accepting the largest sum, which is, the people have strongly imbibed a notion that the war cannot last more than a year or two longer, therefore I suppose they will readily enough imbrace the old proverb \""a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. \"" Much more may be said on the subject, but your Excys experience, & knowledge of these matters renders it unnecessary. This was the plan sir I proposed, but after a very long, & warm debate, it was rejected, & what I have before mentioned, substituted. I am extremely anxious to have yr. Excys opinion on this matter, therefore must earnestly request it of you, I mean it only for my private information, as the business is already determined, & I suppose will not be altered.(3) There is one objection I am aware of, that is, the enormous expense it would create. To this I would answer it is better at once to incur the most enormous expense, & let there be an end of it, than to be every year running into very heavy expences, to answer little, or no valuable purpose, on the contrary, rather tending to throw our affairs into the utmost confusion.  The reduction of the batallions, & consequently of a great many officers, yr. Excy will at once see the propriety of keeping private, untill finally determined by Congress.(4) I have the honor to be, with the highest respect And the most sincere Esteem, Yr.

Virginia is Supposed to be the object. General Washingtons Army is Again in motion, to Cross the North River, with a View perhaps to divert the Enemy from Sending Troops to the Southward. I wish I Could Congratulate you on the Arrival of the Second Division of the French fleet, so long expected, And whose Arrival has been so often reported.

I am under the greatest apprehension for the French at that place.  The Delegates from the Eastern States say that the meeting of the Congress or Convention is for the purpose of falling upon ways & means to provide for the Army. I suspect something more-a little time will discover their design. Some late Moves by Virg. seconded by New York-has alarmed some Members of the Eastern States- And I hope will produce good Effects as it will probably attach them more to the Maryland claim than formerly.(2) I am glad to hear the Mercht. at Baltimore take our Money at 40 for one as it will soon in consequence thereof pass here indeed it is at least 50 Per Ct. better than Continental.

  Dear Sir, Philadela. Sepr. 26th. 1780. The interval between the coming in and going out of the post is so short, that we have it not in our power at this Time, to give you the information which you desire.(1) We can assure you that very inconsiderable quanties have been imported by the Commercial Committee; some Linens have from Time to Time arrived but the quality and quantity we shall endeavour to inform you of in a few Days, as we are at present unacquainted with the amount of the returns. It has always been the object of Congress and the Duty of the Cloathier General to distribute the Cloth that was provided with impartiallity, if it has not been the case, we shall be able soon to give your Excellency information upon the subject. The present Cloathier General (2) is a native of Maryland a man of Honor and a good officer and we believe no partial distribution has been made since his appointment.  We shall endeavour by the first oppertunity to inform you of the Cloathing & Military Stores annually imported by the United States.(3) The quantity will be so small that we believe it will give your Excellency very little pleasure; and if the ten thousand Suits which SEPTEMBER 26 , 1 780  ought to have come out in the Alliance and is now daily expected in the Ariel, does not arrive, and the State cannot furnish Cloathing for their own Troops, they must be in a most deplorable Situation through the whole of the approaching Season; for little or none can be expected from the Board of War; we shall however take every step in our power to secure for our own Troops their share of that little, small as it is.  The Cloathing which Majr. Giles drew at Camp for the Newraised Regt. is now here, and we shall detain the officer, which he employed in this Business for five or six days, in which Time the Secretary of the Board of War assures us they shall be finished; we do this the more readily as it corresponds with the Majors orders.  Your Excellencys Letter to the Board of War we shall seal and deliver;(4) and if our Exertion can avail any thing, they shall be employed in behalf of our gallant tho unfortunate Countrymen.  Brigadier Smallwood has been appointed by the unanimous voice of thirteen States a Majr. General. This will give the State some pleasure tho' it is not all that she has a right to expect from Congress; the Troops of other States have received the Thanks of Congress for displaying less gallantry than has lately been exhibited by the Delaware & Maryland line.  We have no intelligence to communicate: Reports prevail that the French Fleet is arrived at Rhode Island, but it wants confirmation. Admiral Rhodney is still at the Hook, and Graves is out. By the last letters from Camp preparations were making for an embarkation.

  Sir, Philadelphia 26th Sept. [1780] I sit down not to give You any agreable Information, but meerly to give You my Opinion concerning the Event of the Controversy about the Grants if we push it to a determination. It is in short this I believe we may carry it by the Majority of a single State. New Hampshire now represented by General Sullivan alone seems too favorable to the People of the Grants; and countenances an Idea too prevalent in Congress, that the dispute between New Hampshire and New York should be first setled by a Court of Commissioners constituted agreably to the Articles of Confederation. The End in View is evident.(1) It is to create delay & thereby to discourage the Subjects of our State & strengthen the Vermonteers. We have however gone thro' the Evidence on our part, a portion of which from Mr McKesson came just at the nick of Time. In short I am at a Loss what is best to be done. If we push for a determination we may gain it by a bare Majority; but even this depends upon the Prospects we have of New Jersey. Mr. Duane is of Opinion that Maryland will be with us. I differ with him. In short it seems to be the System of the smaller States to compel the larger (the western Bounds of which are undefined) to large Cessions. This they expect to effect by embarrassing us with respect to the setled part of the Country. General Sullivan is sick which has suspended the Business for a few days; (2) & I have been so much indisposed myself by a small fever hanging over me that I have not attended Congress for three or four days past. I am of Opinion the sooner we press the Matter to its Crisis the better, For I fear the Interest agt. us is growing. Not that I imagine a Majority will expressly decide agt. Us, but that it may eventually be done by procrastination.  Every Account we receive from the Southward convinces Us that our Troops, notwithstanding their General defeat are [hurt]ing the Enemy in ditail. As to News from the Eastward You are so much nearer the Source of Intelligence that You must be better informed than We are. Yesterday a Report came from Camp that the Second SEPTEMBER 26, 1780  division of the French fleet was arrived at Rhode Island, & that our Army was in Motion.  I am sorry to be obliged Sir to tell You that the Want of Money will soon Occasion the State of New-York to be unrepresented. Its delegates can bear their disgraceful Situation but a few days longer. To be absolutely without Money in a place so expensive as this is intollerable. Mr. Livingston has been obliged to borrow £2000 on his private Credit to discharge his Board & defray his Expences home; and would have set off this day, had I not desuaded him from it. I owe about £4,000 for Board & have not a farthing to pay it with. Mr Duane talks of returning home in a few days & so must I if we do not get immediate Relief; & to get away I must endeavor to procure a Loan on my private Credit. How mortifying this will be to Us & disgraceful to the State, as the Cause cannot be concealed, you, Sir, can easily judge.  I am, Sir with the greatest Respect, Your Excellency's Most obedient Servt. Jno. Morin Scott  P.S. Should it be asked as to the 30,000 dollars expended I can answer that of the whole [. . .] fell into my hands. Mr. Livingston had 12,000-at that Time I owed near 15,000 for Board which I paid, 900 for Major Hunt & sundry advances for General Schuyler on a Warrt. for 10,000 dollars of which I have not yet been able to get more than one half. From this my poverty may be judged of. To shew that a large nominal Sum is of little real Value here, our board is £4 hard per week and only Water to drink-Exchange 75 for one. Add to this Barber, washerwoman & a little necessary Liquor in a very sickly place and then judge of the Expence. In short I am very sorry for my Reappointment; For I would not wish to incur the Suspicion of extravagance.  ""

  Sir, Philada. 27 September 1780 10 oClock in the Evening I shall come too late to give your Excellency the first Information, for doubtless you will have heard, of the infernal and traiterous Plot just discovered. (1) The strong Fortress of West-point, with the  SEPTEMBER 27, 1780  Garrison, was within a few Hours of being betrayed to the Enemy by that Miscreant Arnold, and, notwithstanding the Discovery, may still have fallen, but I hope not. The Villain is fled to the Enemy; and Major Andre the British Adjutant General, is seized as a spy, I think at the Fort; the Letters are not circumstancial. The Apprehension of this Officer led to the Discovery of Arnold, but not being present at the Time, and the Affair of Andre, making some Stir, he made his Escape before he could be laid Hold of.  This Man has been long wearying Congress about the Allowance of a voluminous Account of Expenditures in Canada and elsewhere, trumped up with a View of cheating the Publick out of a large Sum of Money, but by the Firmness and Attention of the Chamber of Accounts and the Treasury-board; and the resolute Opposition of a great Majority of the Members of Congress, he has been disappointed.(2) Probably he has found better Success in getting Money from the Enemy, his dissipated and expensive Course of Living in this City, for fifteen months past, has so involved and improverished him that money was probably become very necessary to him.  Some Time since he went to the Army, where the Commander in Chief, in forming the Line for the Campaign, assigned him the Command of a Division according to his Rank which is well forward in the List of Major-Generals. Being lame with the Wounds he received at Saratogha, and not so fit for Duty on Horseback, he made this a Plea, and requested the Command of West-point, as better suited to his Condition for Service. The General, in Consideration of his Services heretofore which indeed have not been few nor small, assented. Here, no Doubt, he expected to put his Treachery in Practice and the Time of the General's Absence at Hartford, to which Place he went to have an Interview with the Comander of the French Armament at Rhode-Island, was probably fixed upon as most proper and convenient. It was concerted with Clinton that an Attack should be made on the Fort, which Arnold, with the best Face he could put on the Matter, would have given up. Thus he would have been an ostensible Prisoner, received his Wages as a Traitour, and eventually disposed of himself as he pleased. On the night of the 25th inst the horrid Villainy was to have been put in Execution. Lt. Colonel Hamilton, one of the General's Aids, and principally employed in making the Discovery, has behaved with much Credit. He dates his Letter to General Greene from Verplank's Pointt whither he pursued Arnold, but a little too late, the 25th, and General Greene dates to Congress the 25th 11 o'Clock at night. What has taken Place since we know not. The Express rode all Night, and I should have wrote Your Excellency this Morning, but that strict secrecy was commanded till Measures were taken to seize his Papers, and his Accomplices, if any, in Town or near it. About 9 o'Clock in the Forenoon his House was taken Possession of by a strong Guard, and his Papers secured.  The Examination is not finished. If he has any Accomplices here they will be detected, unless they save themselves by Flight previous to Suspicion. He had many Tory-relations and Acquaintances in and about Town, the Consequence of his marrying into a Tory-Family,(3) but it is not likely he has trusted any of them with the Secret. One Letter written to his wife after he went to the Army, tells her by all Means to sell off every Thing for hard Money, and come to him; there is nothing more direct that I know of as yet. His Wife went to him about the Time, but there are Circumstances which look as if she was not acquainted with his Intentions, if he had indeed formed any precise Scheme at that Time. This however is only my Conjecture. He has, in all Likelihood his most material Papers with him at the Army, where they will be thoroughly searched for. As to Persons concerned with him, it is a Doubt with me whether he trusted many. They say Thomas Smith,(4) Brother of William, has gone off with him. Having the Chief Command of the Fort, it was not so necessary to form a Party. A little Time will give us the Particulars when they will be circumstancially made public.  People of this sort have their Connections and Lines of Communication through the Country; if any Persons in New-Jersey fall under Suspicion, I hope your Excellency will have them seized without Ceremony.  In what a Situation must General Washington be, contending with such an unprincipled Castoff as Clinton. The Meanest of the Sons of Men, who is above nothing however infamous, diabolical and unmilitary. An Adjutant General, taken as a Spy in an Enemy's Camp is really Food for Story, and must make a Figure there, especially if he is hung up for his Pains, the inevitable Consequence by the Rules of War.

  Sir Philada. 30 September 1780 A new apportionment of the Quotas of Men in the several States will take Place in a little Time. It has, in my Opinion, been too long delayed, as the Troops for the next Campaign ought to be in the Field by the 1st of January coming, to give proper Opportunity of Manoeuvring and fitting them for active Field-service. I hope it is the settled sentiment of the State, and of their Representatives in Legislature, to make no more Enlistments for short Periods, but to take measures for raising a solid permanent Force to serve during the War. I am convinced, from the most satisfactory Examination, that the Disbursements we have this year made in New-Jersey for partial Recruits, would have nearly, if not quite, produced our Proportion of Enlistments for the war. Perhaps I might say they would have done a great Deal more. It gives me Pleasure to inform you that the Preference of recruiting for the War is become general, and, if diligently practised upon, will be of inumerable good Consequences to the Union in general, and to each separate State in particular; more especially those which are the Seat of the War, or in the Vicinity of it.  The Legislature will be glad to begin their Preparations early. This Circumstance is essencial to their Success and Effect. I have therefore used all possible Attention to get them the necessary Information. Our Quota will be about 1200 Men; I say this, not with perfect Certainty, because the Resolutions are not yet passed but with a Probability which may be pretty securely relied on; and if it should be a few over or under, it is better to risque that than to suffer the least Delay. The return of our Brigade the 1st current is  as follows ................................1 Regiment 247 Rank and File 2 Do 320  3 Do 263 on Spencer's of the addi[ti]onal 59 889 There are a few more in some other Corps, I cannot ascertain what is the Amount. Nor do I know what Number of these are upon limited SEPTEMBER 30, 1780  Enlistments, but believe not many. However your Excellency by writing to the Commander in Chief, will obtain full Satisfaction upon every Particular; and he will give it with the highest Pleasure on hearing the State are adopting means to render their Quota of Force [ope]rable; as it has been the Source of inexpressible wretchedness and Suffering to him, when his Army has, from Time to Time, mouldered away under his Eyes, upon short Engagements. We may set down our present Deficiency from 250 to 300 Rank and File; perhaps the Medium between these Extremes will be tolerably exact. This is upon the Quota expected to be established, which will, we hope, be more nearly conformed to our Ability and just Proportion than some of the former have been.(1) I will not venture to say that this, that or the other mode of raising these men will be the best. The wisdom of the Legislature, comprehending fully the Ideas and Circumstances of the People in every Part of the State, will decide judiciously on this Object. I will only say that a few hard Dollars on the Drum-head, are a mighty Engine in recruiting; not indeed decisive with all, but with most who take up the Profession of Soldiership. A Specie-tax to the Amount, can, I should think, be collected without Difficulty; for if we compute every recruit to cost from 50 to 55 Dollars, which is not the lowest Bounty, the Duplicates would not average perhaps more than 6/3: and would it not be better for a man of any Substance or Business to pay ten Times that Sum, than submit to the Inconveniences we have suffered for several years past. The State of Maryland have lately raised about 500 Men to serve during the war, by assessing the proportionate number on each District throughout the State, the Districts to produce the Men as they could get them; the Bounty to be raised by Assessment of the taxable Estates of the District. If I am not mistaken, the Mode is similar to that we have more than once taken to raise Men for a few Months. Will endeavour to procure and forward a Copy of the Law, as it may possibly be preferred to try different Methods, if they can be prevented from interfering in their Operation.  I have been informed that some of the States who have Militia with the Army for the present Campaign, have recruited many of them for the War by putting some hard Money into the Hands of their Officers at Camp; and that some have been enlisted for that Period on the Notes of the Officers, engaging to pay the Bounty in hard Money at a stipulated Time. Perhaps some of the Men we have there might be obtained in this Way; and as it would not take long to raise so small a Tax as is before mentioned, it may be worth considering whether we had not better set about it immediately. It is to be hoped that the Clothing for the Army will arrive from abroad in some short Time, and a Suit to each Man enlisting, which the   Comander in Chief is empowered to order, would be no inconsiderable Temptation.  On the Circumstance of the Bounty, mentioned above, I observe, that it seems to be the Sum generally thought of. In hard Dollars it would make a powerful Show, especially as such have, for Some Time past, been very little in Sight. Gentlemen from the different Counties will be able to determine whether any Thing less would be sucessful, or whether more will be necessary. It is pretty certain Congress will fix upon that, or Something near it.  The Adopting and Executing of decisive Measures to fix a respectable Army in the Field for the Continuance of the war, will have a great Effect in securing an early Peace. The Nation we contend with, being old and settled in its Forms of Government and War, are more alarmed at seeing fixed Institutions and established Resources, though they should not be the most perfect and productive, than they are with the most formidable temporary Expedients. It would therefore be a desirable Thing to have a constant, standing mode of keeping our Quota of Troops full from Campaign to Campaign, and Time to Time, without being under the Necessity to pass a Law for that Purpose every Year, and perhaps oftener; and this, even if we were in Expectation of a Peace within a few months, because that is a matter of Uncertainty, and this would be a Means of procuring it.  One of the Recommendations of Congress will be as has been the Case heretofore, to keep a proper Officer or Officers constantly employed in the State for enlisting Recruits, and to direct the Officers at the Army to pay constant attention to the same Thing when Militia or temporary aides are detached to serve with them on Special Occasions. For this Purpose Money ought to be lodged in the Hands of the Executive, and of the Commanding Officer of the Troops of the State.  I have written your Excellency thus particularly, because I have this Subject greatly at Heart, and am convinced that the Interest of the State is much concerned in it. I hope in a little Time to be able to forward you the Proceedings of Congress respecting it, but as these may be delayed longer than is expected \""I could wish the Occasion not to be lost, as every Day is precious. I am afraid the Army will crumble down again this Fall by the Expiration of Enlistments, and the State will again find it self in the perilous Situation it has seen more than once. It is true it wd be little available if only we perform the Duty we owe ourselves and to our Country, and the other States are delinquent. This however would not hold as an Excuse and the less so as we are most immediately interested. But I have better Hopes of all the States, some of whom are already at Work.  I have to beg Your Excellency will communicate this Letter with the Assistance which your Advice and better Reasoning is able to  give it. I make not the least Doubt it coincides with your Sentiments.  I have the Honour to be, with great Respect, your Excellency's obedt. hble Servant. Wm Churchill Houston  ""

  D'r Sir, Philadelphia Octr. 1, 1780.  .... Mr. Hill and myself flattered ourselves that we should have received, ere this, an account of the proceedings of our late Assembly, and their Sentiments, as well as your private Opinion, respecting the Conduct of Genl. Gates. From the Circumstances of his Conduct, particularly his rapid Retreat, and the Length of it, and some Hints in one of his Letters, and Strictures in others, it appears to us that Genl. Gates can no longer continue in that Command with Satisfaction to himself, or with a prospect of rendering essential Service to the United States. We hope your next favour will throw some Light on this Subject (1) ....  Congress has recommended to the several States to make provision for the support of their Delegates, so that they may not draw out of the Continental Treasury.(2) The Reasons are the exhausted state of the Treasury, and the obvious Impropriety of allowing Delegates to draw at Will. You will be pleased to mention this Circumstance to our Assembly, at their next meeting,(3) that some provision may be made; otherwise their Delegation may possibly be defeated[?], or at least involved in distressing and shameful Circumstances.  By a Resolution of Congress it is recommended to the several States to surrender a part of Western Territory, to induce Maryland to confederate.(4) Maryland surely has great Merit in the present Contest; yet I think it will be time enough for No. Carolina to deliberate on the surrender of Western Territory, when the States have vigorously supported and finally secured her in her Eastern Territory, and when they have moreover shewn a proper Liberality in the settlement of her accounts (4) ....  Reprinted from Burnett, Letters, 5:394, \""from the collection of the late Adrian H. Joline of New York. \""  (1) For the court of inquiry ordered by Congress on October 5, see Samuel Huntington to Washington, October 6, 1780.  (2) See Samuel Huntington to the States, October 3, 1780.  (3) In February 1781 the North Carolina delegates themselves explained \""this Circumstance\"" to the assembly in the following undated letter, written by Jones  OCTOBER 2, 1780  and signed by Jones for himself and Whitmell Hill. The document, which is damaged, was undoubtedly written after the delegates had returned to the state.  \""We beg Leave to remind your honorable Body of the Resolution of Congress recommending to the [States to Supply money for?] the Support [of their Delegates, . . .] Resolution [ . . . ] Reasons-the Insufficiency of the Continental Treasury to comply with the various and pressing demands on it, and the Impropriety of allowing any person whatever [to draw] at Discretion. It is now expected [ . . . ] that the Delegates of no State except Georgia, and So. Carolina, shall draw from the Continental Treasury, for the Expences of their Attendance. In this State of Affairs it is a absolutely necessary that some adequate provison be made for your Delegation: but as it is possible that Disappointments may happen, in this Respect, altho' the Fund established [by the State may] be apparently [sufficient, we respectfully sugges]t the propriety of authorising [the Delegates] of the State to draw on the Continental Treasury for their reasonable Expences in Cases of Necessity. Many of the States require two, or more, of their Delegates to attend in Congress, yet at [the same time] authorise any one of them, in the absence of the other, or others, to vote and represent the State. Perhaps it might be expedient, in the present moment, for this State to adopt the same Rule, and the rather, as it frequently happens that only two Delegates are attending at Philadelphia, and one or [the other may be absent through illness?] or attendance [to some other duty which?], of Necessity, [leaves the State unrepresented?].  \""During our attendance in Congress last Summer we expended large Sums of Money, the greatest part of which we borrowed on our own Credit, as there was very little to be obtained from Congress, and our private funds proved insufficient, and are bound to make good the Depreciation. We found it impracticable to take Receipts for our Disbursements, it would have been an endless Work; therefore we only noticed the gross sum we expended. We request [that your] honorable Body [authorise a Board or?] a Committee [to provide for our support?] in such Manner as to you [may seem] just, which we are confident will be perfectly satisfactory.\"" General Assembly Records, Nc-Ar.  The assembly responded by empowering the Commissioners of Trade to provide the delegates with funds for \""reasonable Expenditures,\"" but also permitting them to draw on the Continental treasury if necessary. They were also to be reimbursed money borrowed for support on their own credit with allowances for depreciation. The assembly further declared that two delegates were sufficient to represent the state and that the vote of either was binding in the absence of the other. See the N.C. State Records, 17:674, 708-9, 755, 791.  (4) In a section of the letter omitted in this extract, Jones apparently also reported that the Board of War had procured 800 tents for the southern army. This point is also noted in Jones' October 10 letter to Nash where he stated that he had since learned that only 500 were obtained, \""and I fear it will be a considerable time before they can be forwarded.\""

The fort at West point was not only to have been delivered up to the Enemy, but our worthy General was also to have been put into their hands. The General that day Came to Arnolds Quarters which was at Robinsons House on the opposite Side of the river from the Fort, Where he intended to have Stayed that night.

  Dr. Mr. Burke, Sir, Philadelphia 2d Octr.1780 Many Opportunities from your place have offered since I had the pleasure of receiving yr. last, and as you have not noticed them by a Line to me, must suppose, that you waited the Rise of the Assembly, when you would have it in your power to afford me some satisfaction in consequence of the measures adopted by them for the Defence of the Country, and for supplying the Army with necessaries immediately &c. I hope our State with the assistance it may receive from Virga. will be able to repell the Invasion from our own State, except a considerable Reinforcement should be sent Cornwallis this Winter which event we ought to be prepared for, as I know of no Obstacle to prevent it. The Campaign, in this quarter, has been altogether inactive, as yet; our Hopes and our Fears have been alternately wrought on; one day encouraged with the Intelligence of the arrival of the French Fleet, and the next depressed by receiving certain Accts. of a superior British Fleet being arrived at N. York. A very considerable Embarkation has taken place at N.Y. very lately, which it is one day said to be destined to attack the French Army and Fleet at Rhode Island, the next, that Virga. is their Object; however, the late discovery of yr. Friend Arnolds Treason, fully convinces me, that their great preparation was for the Reduction of Wt. Point, which it seems would have been an easy conquest, Arnold having previously sold that important Post; the particulars of this Villany has not reached us, but from what we can collect it is some Thing like the following. Mr. Andree, the Adjutant Genl. of the British Army came incog. to Arnolds head Quarters, and stipulated with him the essentials for his surrendering the Post, in consequence of which Arnold gave him in Writing the strength of the Garrison, the mode of attack to be made by the Enemy and the manner he should conduct the Defence, so as to render the Reduction certain and easy; having adjusted matters, Arnold gave Andree a Pass directing a free passage thro the several Guards; in this he OCTOBER 2, 1780  succeeded, and was twenty miles in his Return, when he was stopped by 4 Militia Men, without an officer, who being directed by Inspiration, would not suffer him to pass without a Search, in which the above papers were discovered, and they conducted him to the nearest Continental officer, as a Spye who immediately dispatched an Express to inform Arnold that there had been a Spye in his Camp, and that he was apprehended, at the same time described him so as to satisfy Arnold that it was Andree, on which, he immediately pushed down the River to a British Frigate, then lying about 15 Miles below; had this event took place it must have affected us more than any stroke we have recd since the War; as our Army would have been immediately cut off from the total supply of Meat, and had the British pushed their Arms into the Eastern States, there would have been no Regular Army to oppose them, and no Bread to have supported the Militia had they collected, in fact, I look on such an escape as equal to a small Victory. On Arnolds running to the Enemy, his papers at this place were siezed, and several of our speculating Gentry are discovered as being connected with him in Scenes of villainous Traffic with the Enemy &c. Yr. Friend Jas. Maise's Reputation suffers no small stain in consequence of these discoveries, among others; none of them have been apprehended yet, but suppose necessary steps will be fallen upon to punish such Treason.(1)  ""

  Sir, Philada. 2 October 1780 Your Excellency has doubtless received, officially from the President, the Resolutions of Congress of 26 August last; (1) the Journals of that month for the Use of the legislature have also been forwarded.  The Recommendation for drawing in the old Bills of Credit, by Tax or Excha[nge] is exactly conformable to the Provisions made by the Act of Assembly of 9 June last. Our State was almost the only one who took the Precaution of [setting] an Exchange; all now see the Propriety of it. Without Doubt that [. . .] is an apparent Loss to the Community, if the Bills can be made to circul[ate at,] or nearly at, their value; but it does not appear to me a real [. . .] Detriment of having the old Bills in Circulation along with the new [. . .] length of Time, would be much greater. It is certainly the univer[sal in]terest to have the old Bills destroyed as soon as possible, and I add [. . .] also; after these are sunk as the law prescribes, it will be the Wisdom [. . .] Country to have no more Paper-credit. When Trade is free we may [have] Specie enough; nothing ever made Paper Necessary  OCTOBER 2, 1780  to us but the Dependence of America on Great Britain. It is only a Sign of the Sign of Wealth delusive and ensnaring by making People think they are richer than they are while it is but a mortgage on their future Industry, for which they will ever pay more than it is worth. Necessity only could justify the Use of it in the present Instance.  Two Things I will mention tending greatly to help the new Bills Credit when issued. Taxes as high as the People can conveniently pay, as near as possible to the publick Expenditures; and the Payment of these Taxes in the new Bills or Specie. If Taxes could keep Pace with th[e] Expenditures the Bills would be in full Credit at all Times to the End of their Term; therefore Taxes payable in them must be a good Mean[s. ] With this View the three-Millions-Tax is recommended to be raised with[in] the present year, payable in these Bills or Specie. In our State, however and some others, it will not have the fullest Opportunity, as Certificates for Debts, due from the Community to Individuals, are intended to be received and must be made so from Necessity. Our Quota of this Tax is a fif[th] Part of the monthly Assessment of the State, as settled 7 October 1779, name[ly] 180,000 Dollars, or sixty-seven thousand five Hundred Pounds. If the Certificates in the States were proportionably distributed in the several Counties this Tax would be very easily paid, especially if proper Barriers were erected against Fraud, and they were allowed to be transferable. There are more than Certificates enough to pay it. It would be politick also, as we thereby discharge so much of our national Debt in an easy Way, while other States pay Money. The Transference of Certificates I have ever been opposed [to] as it has a direct Tendency to depreciate circulating Money by increasing it's Quantity without Limitation, and could only be advis[able] on the prospect of getting in the Certificates at once. We cann[ot rep]ay them in Money consistently with other Calls, and their Source of [disco]ntent to the People is very great. But if the Certificates are not [jus]tly distributed, or cannot become so by Transfer, there may be a Diffi[culty] in collecting this Tax which ought to be considered, provided the Taxes [. . .] by the Act of 9 June last are as much as can possibly be paid in Money [. . .] or none of the old Bills come in by Exchange, they must come in by Tax; if they do come [in] by Exchange, the Taxes laid by the Act just mentioned May be paid at a fourtieth Part in Specie or the new Bills. However, as those Parts of the State which have no Certificates, or but few, have probably sold their Produce for Money, which is therefore more plentiful in those Parts; and as most People I find, consider the Taxes in themselves very easy and light, I would willingly hope that the Legislature will put this recommendation in Practice without Loss of Time. It will be of great Advantage to the Publick by paying Debts, and, it would seem, of no less to the State when duly attended to.  I find it is the Opinion of many that the United States could tax up to the Expenditures of the War, if Economy were properly established in the publick Departments. This with me, is a doubtful Position. Certain it is we could come much nearer it than we have hitherto. It has been the principal Business of Congress for some Time past, to retrench Expenses; and in this View the Scarcity of Money has been of real Use. One third is paired off already, and much may and will yet be done. I am, with great Respect, your Excellencys obedient humble Servt,  Wm Churchill Houston ""

  Dear Sir Philadelphia October 2d 1780 Since my Last by General Foulsom (1) the affair of Vermont has been frequently on the Tapis but Congress have not as yet come to any Determination not Even to appoint Commissioners, but I believe a few days more will produce Something. Vermont has put in two pleas to the Jurisdictions, & Even threatens to form an Alliance with Great Britain in Case Congress Shall Declare them Dependant on any State. I Shall from time to time Acquaint you with the proceedings of Congress in this affair.  I need not Trouble you with a particular Relation of Arnolds villany as you will See all the Circumstances which have yet Transpired in the Inclosed Gazette: our Political affairs are So Deranged as to prevent my giving you any Tolerable Account respecting them, & was I to attempt it The Task would be Desagreable to me & painful to you. The Members of Congress are mostly new & I believe in General Honest; most of those who were governed by Party Spirit are Recalled but I am Sorry to Say that in my opinion Greater wisdom than the present members possess would be requisite to Conduct or rather to Restore our publick affairs from that Situation into which Ignorance Treachery or Inattention have thrown them. Our Confederation is not in force & Even if Acceeded to would be found weak & perhaps far from answering the Designs, our Treasury is Empty, our Credit Low, our Finances Deranged & the People at Large Suspicious of Every Species of our paper Emissions; particular States & Even among those who have Acceeded to the Confederation will comply with or Reject the requisitions of Congress as their own opinion or Interests Seems to Direct; Congress of Course becomes a Body without power & the States the Several Componant parts of a Monster with Thirteen heads. How we are to obtain Relief is the Important Inquiry. This can be Done only in one way that I can possibly Conceive which is to Call a Convention of the Several States to Declare what power Congress is to possess & to vest them with Authority to use Coercive measures with those States which refuse to Comply with reasonable requisitions. Measures Should be Instantly fallen upon to put an End to the Present war; for which purpose Aids both of Men & money together with a Strong Naval force Should be Demanded from France & Spain & we Should Tell them fully our Situation & The Distresses brought upon us by Supporting a war of Six years without Aid from Foreign Force or Foreign Loans & that we must at Last Sink under the weight unless powerfully Supported by our Allies. This will bring matters to a point, & I Doubt not answer the purpose of putting a Speedy & happy Conclusion to the present American War. OCTOBER 2, 1780  This matter will be Debated tomorrow & I hope the Most Decisive Measures will be pursued. Spain has requested to know if we will build Frigates for her, this will be Determined tomorrow & I hope in the affirmative as it will be a means of Introducing Large Quantities of Specie among us-which must Eventually become our Circulating medium as paper cannot much Longer answer the purpose-it is Easy to keep up the Credit of paper by Seasonable Taxes; but to restore it to Credit after it has been Imprudently Suffered to Depreciate requires more than Humane wisdom.

Their respective Characters, Abilities and Merit were well-known to the Electors, who therefore acted with their Eyes open. It is to be presumd they have been influencd to this Choice by the pure Motives of publick Affection. A due Attention to the Administration of Government I fancy, will soon determine whether they have acted with Wisdom or not.  By the inclosed Papers you will observe that the late General Arnold, after having committed the blackest Treason against his Country, has thrown himself into the Arms of its Enemies. The Particulars youl see in the Paper. You know that I have had my Suspicions of this Traitor, and therefore it is not wonderful that I  OCTOBER 3, 1780  am not so astonished, as if some other officer had been detected of the Treason. He has been gibbeted in the Streets by the Populace, anathematizd by some of the Clergy in the Pulpits, and his Name has with Indignation been struck out of the List of Officers by Order of Congress.  This City has for some time past been a complete Hospital, and many are still sick. I thank God, I am in good Health. Remember me to my Family & Friends. Adieu my dear-your affectionate,  S A ""

  My dear Sir Philade Octob 3 1780. I have not yet acknowledged your Favor of the of Septr. It is no Novelty to me to hear you expressing your laudable Zeal for the Safety and Welfare of our Country. I think your Apprehensions of Injury accruing to the Publick from a Misapplication of the Resolutions of Congress respecting British Effects, are well founded. A new Resolution is now on the Table to guard against such Injuries. (1)  I have before me your Letter of the 17th of Sept, and am obligd to you for the favorable Allowance you make for my not having written to you lately. Without Affectation or Partiality I may say, you have done me but Justice. And yet I would have written by the last Post, if I could have given you any tollerable Assurance respecting a Matter of a private Nature which you formerly mentiond to me.(2) I will continue to press the Matter till it is finishd.  Why will you upbraid me, my Friend, with the Votes of \""my beloved Town,\"" in Favor of a Man,(3) whom neither you nor I would set up for the Governor of the Common Wealth? It is true, I love the People of Boston. I have spent much of my Time in their Service, and have labord to promote their Reputation and true Interest. I confess, I feel chagrind and disappointed at the Preferrence they have given. But is an honest & virtuous People incapable of Error? They acted, you will say, with their Eyes open. They knew the different Characters, Abilities and Merit of the Candidates. But may they not have been decievd with false Appearances for the Moment? A due Attention to the Administration of Government, will enable them OCTOBER 3, 1780  to measure the Capacity of him whom they have made the Object of Their present Choice. That Watchfulness and Jealousy which I still hold to be the best Securities of the publick Liberty will guard them against future Mistakes.  I have not Time at present to say to you so much as I intended. As I am determind that our Correspondence shall not be broken on my part, I will write to you by the next and every Opportunity. Before I conclude I must inform you that it is hinted to us in a Letter from a Boston Friend,(4) that Colo Sears who has lately been at Camp has reported that Mr M ____ws (5) declared there repeatedly and without Hesitation that Congress consisted of a Set of Rogues or Rascals. I wish, if Mr Sears heard that Declaration, he would certify it, in order that proper Notice may be taken of it. No Member of any Body of Men would undertake to answer for the Character or Conduct of every Individual. As far as I am able to judge the Declaration is illiberal, indecent and unjust, and probably might be made in an unguarded Hour. I have heard of such Language before, coming from Persons of low & contemptible Characters, influenced by others who, to wound our Cause in the tenderest Part, would destroy the Confidence of the People in Congress. It is the Language of Tories, and in Times passd it would not be sufferd to be used among Citizens unpunishd. Adieu, Your faithful Friend, S A  ""

  My Dear sir, Philadelphia October 3d. 1780  Yours of the 2d September I have Just received. No Accounts of the French fleet and as the Season is so far Advanced it is probable they will not be here at all-indeed their Arrival is not now so desireable. I never was very Sanguine in my Expectations Against New York And it is now quite too late to attempt A reduction of that place. They might render good Service to the Southward. The great preparations lately at New York for a large embarkation of Troops which were generally Supposed to have been intended Against Rhode Island or Virginia Appears now to have been designed to Carry Arnolds Wicked plot Against West point into Execution, in which it is probable they would have Succeeded had it not been timely discovered. By the inclosed papers you will be informed of that treacherous Affair so far as is Come to hand. Our assembly you are so Kind as to inform me is to meet the 17th instant-the important matters they will have under Consideration will it is probable Occasion a long Session. I pray god Something Substantial may be done. I hope our Troops will be particularly Attended to. They must be in a wretched Condition for want of Cloathing having lost all their Baggage in the late Action. We have no very material intelligence from the Southward, What we have is rather favourable, Some Skirmishing in which we have been Successful. The Army increasing fast and is now pretty formidable. Governor Nash has requested General Smallwood to take the Command of the Troops in that State, by which it would Seem that Gen. Gates has lost his Confidence and it is more than probable that of the whole Army, should this be the Case no good Can be expected from his being Continued in the Command.

Ulo (1) yesterday and am sorry it is not yet in my power to gratify your hopes with any  OCTOBER 3, 1780  prospect of a successful issue to this campaign. The reports of the approach or arrival of a French fleet continue to be circulated, and to prove groundless. If any foreign operations are undertaken on the continent it will probably be against the Floridas by the Spaniards. A Spanish Gentleman who resides in this City (2) has received information from the Governor of Cuba that an armament would pass from the Havannah to Pensacola towards the end of last month, and that 10 or 12 ships of the line and as many thousand troops would soon be in readiness for an expedition against St Augustine. It would be much more for the credit of that nation as well as for the common good, if instead of wasting their time & resources in these separate and unimportant enterprizes, they would join heartily with the French in attacking the Enemy where success would produce the desired effect.  The inclosed papers contain all the particulars which have been received concerning the apostacy & plot of Arnold. A variety of his iniquitous jobs prior to this chef d'oevres of his villainy, carried on under cover of his military authority, have been detected among his papers, and involve a number of persons both within & without the Enemies lines. The embarkation lately going on at N York, and given out to be destined for Virginia or Rhode Island, was pretty certainly a part of the plot against West Point; although the first representation of it has not yet been officially contradicted.

The one of the 23 contains a variety of important matters, as well as [. . .] enclosures, which I shall now reply to.  What am I to understand by \""Genl.

Great part of your other extracts were new, for which I am much obliged to you. Arnold's affair rests where it did, when I wrote you last, we have received no further information respecting it.  You ask me what is done about a P ____t.(3) I think of all the men of ambition I have ever met with in the course of my peregrinations (which have not been confined within a very narrow compass) S .

So far from his manifesting the least disposition to quit, he seemed to be highly pleased with the opinions of his [you may fill the space as you please] \""that he had a right to set there for life. \"" This is true Republican doctrine. Ay! you may laugh, or get into a passion about it-but I tell you it must be so, because the Greatest Republican (4) in America said so. Damnation sieze such Sycophants! Who will sell their consciencies to the Devil for the sake of carrying a favourite point? After four hours hard struggle, all we could obtain was, that all future P____ts, should be for elected for one year only, but maugre every exertion, they obtruded their favourite upon us for another year. Could Old Randolph (5) have risen from the Dead, & been in the chair, I wou'd have opposed his continuance, with the same activity & spirit, I did the present person, on the principles of true Republicanism, more especially when I so evidently saw, an elevated station had made a man forget himself, who from being a very modest one, had so strongly inbibed the sweets of power, as to become a very conceited, & ambitious one. Did the man possess abilities for the station, I could have acquiessed with a tolerable degree of content, but when I know he possesses no one requisite for it, I must confess my feelings are egregiously hurt. I think, had almost any other man been in his situation, when he found how extremely disagreeable his continuance in office was, to a number of members, he would have made it a point to have had a new election, & taken his chance, but he verifyed the Old proverb \""A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.\"" I have much more to Say on this subject, but will reserve it for a tete a tete.(6)  I come now to the most interesting part of your letter, i.e. the opening, & garbling your letters. Great God! how humiliating is it OCTOBER 3, 1780  to generous minds, to behold the depravity of a part of thy creatures. What baseness, & villany is it that some men will not descend to, to gratify the rancour of their damnd black hearts. The most intimate ties, are made to give place to this hellish principle. Friendship amoung men, is become a sounding brass, or a tinckling symbol.  If I take your meaning right, you suspect some who have professed a friendship for you to have been the authors of this piece of treachery, as black almost as the infernal Arnold's, in my opinion there is little difference \""for he that filches from me my good name, robs me of that which not enriches him, but is to me worse than death.\"" My suspicions bend the same way yours do. But alas! my Dear sir, how can I trace this dark & rascally deed? Do you think he, or they, will be so unguarded as ever to let me penetrate them? No. No. be assured they are too hackneyed in their ways, their contract with the devil is too indissoluble, ever to suffer me to come near enough to them, even, (like Alexander) to cut the knot.  Thus much, from my friendship-I almost blush at writing the word-you may rely on. That no man shall take your name in vain.  As to \""the Committee's wanting to be made Lords and Protectors. \"" I can say thus much-That by the Great God that made me! If I thought I could have influence enough, to make any honest set of men, the REAL PROTECTORS of this grievously injured people, I would harange the multitude, night & day! I would rush into the midnight cabals of artful & designing men & drag them forth to public view! In short, what is it I would not do, at the hazard of my life, to save this land from impending ruin! I each day more visibly perceive the rocks & shoals present their ghastly forms to us, Yet alas! my forebodings are treated with derision, & our helmsmen invariably steer the same course.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia Octr. 4th. 1780 As it is my Duty, so I shall ever receive the most particular Satisfaction, in being able to contribute in the least to your Amusement, while engaged in the arduous business of your Station; it is for this reason I take up my pen to inform you of the News of the Day. With regard to Arnold, we have very little Intelligence more than what is contained in the Public News papers. His very foolish & impertinent Letter to Genl. Washington is in some Prints at large. Andre was detected by some Militia-Men in a manner that does them the highest honor-as soon as their Names are transmitted, Congress will reward them in every way that is in their power.(1) Genl. Washington writes that on examination he finds Varricks & Franks innocent. The Council have ordered old David Franks, Billy Hamilton, Seagrove & Constable to be committed.(2) Clarkson is left to the decision of Mr. Chief-Justice. Congress have ordered Arnolds name to be erased out of the List of Continental Officers. Mrs. Arnold has returned to her Father's-what will be thought of her Residence among us I don't know. Wilkinson is ready to burst with Indignation-is drawing up Associations against any Intercourse with Tory & Suspicious Characters. He will find enough to Subscribe but I am afraid few, or at least not all, will observe the Engagements they enter into.  Congress have nearly finished their Arrangements for the Army of next year-the Expence is calculating. This Day we have been uncommonly busy on a report in Answer to a Letter of Mr. Jayes.(3) It seems that the Court of Madrid oppose violently our claims of a free Navigation up the River Mississipi & make that the chief pretence for delaying to Conclude a Treaty with us. We have however determined unanimously that we will not relinquish this, which we think a most important & clear Right-that however our Minister is at liberty to make any reasonable Regulations to assure the Spanish Nation that we do not wish to carry on any contraband Trade to their prejudice. In the Course of the Conversation which Mr. Jay had with the Spanish Minister the latter mentioned with the appearance of great Satisfaction, that he believed by the beginning of next year, they might be able to lend these States forty thousand pounds-the naming such a pitifull Sum, the strange objections about OCTOBER 4, 1780  the Mississipi and some other parts of the discourse by no means seem flattering. The Spanish Minister has also proposed, & that we shall take into Consideration tomorrow, a Contract for the building of Frigates & other Vessels for the Court of Madrid.(4) After finishing this business, we shall immediately enter on the Report of the Committe of Ways & Means. We have it in Contemplation to desire the States to enable Congress to lay some general Imposts, that may furnish us with a Revennue & which it might be difficult for the States to do separately. This however is but a Scheme in Embryo. What will finally be thought of it I do not know. Information has been received this Day from one of our Captains just returned from his Captivity at New York, that the British have determined to exchange no more Sailors, but oblige our Seamen to serve on board their Ships of War. I was at your house this Afternoon-all are well I believe as I heard no Complaints. Mrs. Cox is in town-whether Mrs. DeBerdt returns with her or not I do not know.  I am, Dr sir, Your much obliged & very hum servt,  Jared Ingersoll P.S. I forgot to mention that we have Information that there is danger of a Continental War in Europe.

This Estimate transmitted as early as possible will put it in the power of the Delegates from Virginia to press its being transmitted to our Commissioner at Madrid with the Estimates from the Other States, and the subject itself together with a speedy compliance we have no doubt will strike you in the same important light in which it has us.

Arnold from the American Cause, and his flight to the Enemy. He on the 23d ultimo Shamefully treacherously and ignominiously deserted the important Post at West point which Garrison he Commanded, after having Concerted Measures with the British Adjutant Genl. Colo. Andre in the Quality of a Spy for delivering it up to the Enemy, with the Blackest Circumstances of treason and Perfidy that ever enterd the heart of any, wretch, but his own. Our Great General Washington, the French Ambassador, and the Marquis de la fayette were to have been his Peace offering to the Enemy. But Mr. Andre was accidentally taken, by a Small party of Militia and is now in our Hands & has probably before this paid his last tribute of Loyalty to his Royal Master together with his infamous Coadjutor Joseph Smith of N. York.(2) This occasiond Arnolds precipitate flight on board a British Man of War which was ready to receive him in case of Accident. The Genl. and other Gentn. above Mentioned arrived at Arnolds Quarters a few minutes after his flight, and he has taken effectual measures to prevent further Mischief. Arnold has wrote him a letter dated on Board the Vulture Sloop imploring his interposition in favor of his Wife whom he has left behind. His Papers have been seized in this City where he some time ago resided And lay open several Scenes of Vilany transacted in the Commercial way while he had the Command here between him and other Miscreants, and have laid a train perhaps for further discoveries. Quid non mortalia pectora cogis Auri Sacra fames?(3) Every Mark of horror and resentment has been expressed by the Army at such atrocious and Complicated Villainy, And the Mob in this City have burnt the traitor in Effigy after Exposing it through the streets with a long purse in one hand   and a Mask in the other and labels descriptive of the Character thus consigned to public infamy and odium. Thus with ignominy have faded the laurels of a hero, and the apellat[ion of] Arnold must be everlastingly changed for one of the Blackest infamy.  Reprinted from Madison, Papers (Hutchinson), 2:110-12, from a MS in the hand of Theodorick Bland, NHi; and Theodorick Bland, The Bland Papers, ed. Charles Campbell, 2 vols. (Petersburg, Va.: Edmund &Julian C. Ruffin, 1840-43), 2:34-36.  (1) The use of \""we\"" and \""us\"" in this letter indicates that Bland drafted it in behalf of the Virginia delegation; and the two subjects discussed-the proposal to build frigates in the United States for Spain and the Arnold-Andre conspiracy-establish its approximate date. Overtures from Spanish foreign minister the Conde de Floridablanca for a contract for \""light frigates, cutters, or swift-sailing vessels\"" had come in a lengthy May 26, 1780, letter from John Jay spelling out Spanish policy. It was read in Congress on August 14 and referred to the committee for foreign affairs. See Roger Sherman to Oliver Wolcott, August 14, note 2; and Wharton, Diplomatic Correspondence, 3:723. It is not known when the committee reported, but John Sullivan speculated that the Spanish proposal would be discussed on October 3, when it was apparently postponed, and Jared Ingersoll expected on the 4th it would be taken up \""tomorrow. \"" See Sullivan to Meschech Weare, October 2, and Ingersoll to Joseph Reed, October 4, 1780. Moreover, the fact that the delegates had not yet learned of the execution of John Andre indicates that the letter was written before they received word of his death, which reached them on October 7.

Notes of the Debates on the Claim of Vermont  Motion Resolved that (1)  That (2) if the Resolution should pass it woud deprive the new State of an Opportunity of supporting their Claim. That he understood they had many things to insist on in favour of their Independancy: That an ex parte hearing woud be unjust: That it was true they had notice and he wished they woud have submitted their Claim to Congress: but as they had rejected our Authority we ought not to decide against them: That Commissioners ought to be appointed by Congress agreeable to the Laws of New York and New Hampshire and the Vermonteers called upon to support their Claims before them: & then Congress might determine the Cause.(3) Col. Bland. That he never coud agree to the Resolution moved for. It was an indirect & unfair manner of deciding the Question. It woud deprive the Vermonteers of all future opportunity of Vindicating their Independance. That they had been grievously oppressed by New York. Their Persons imprisoned & their Land seized; and had a Right to Independance. That New York had proved  OCTOBER 6, 1780  that New Hampshire had no Title and New Hampshire that New York had None: That therefore it belonged to Neither: That the Charter to the Duke of York comprehended New Jersey And Delaware and parts of Connecticut and Pensylvania and coud not be admitted to establish a Title: That there were several independant Nations besides Vermont in the Bounds of the United States: the Cherokees, Creeks &c. That  He therefore moved that the Resolution under Consideration shoud be postponed to make place for another which he moved-to witt-the People of Vermont declared an Independant State. But he was not seconded.  Mr. Maddison. Expressed his surprize that the Motion shoud be represented as unfair or indirect. That he intended it to bring the true Question before Congress: for that if the District in Question was comprehended within the Jurisdiction of one or more of the United States, it must necessarily follow, that the Inhabitants coud have no Right to set up an independant State. That it had been clearly proved to lie within New York or New Hampshire: for as these States were bounded upon each other there coud be no Room between them for another Jurisdiction. That Congress <<having the Rights of peace and war coud not and> by the original Union of the States must have a <<Controuling> Superior [deciding ?] power over the states and that (4) Mr. Howly. That Gentlemen had not touched on the true Grounds which ought to decide the present Question. The Right ought not to be considered: it was premature and tho' much might be said upon it, at this time it was improper. The Expediency of a Decision in the critical Situation of our Affairs ought alone to be the Basis of the determination. He then insisted that it was no time to controvert our Jurisdictions but to oppose the common Enemy. After expatiations on this Topic, he said that he must make some Remarks on the Right. That the people ought to be considered as direlict for New Hampshire had given up & abandond them: And that the King of Great Britain had no power without their own Consent to annex them to New York. That they never did Acquiesce under that Government. That the Crown of England coud not like an arbitrary German prince make over his People as if they were a Flock of Sheep. That New York did not begit the Inhabitants of the Grant: that they had treated them cruelly, imprisond their persons and seized their Lands: that they had a Right to become Independant on the same principles which had Authorized these States to shake off the British Yoke.

  Sir Circular Philada October 6. 1780  Your Excellency will receive herewith enclosed an Act of Congress of the 21 Ulto, containing a new Arrangement of the Army. Special Reasons have delayed the Sending of it forward to the several States until this Time.(1) By this Arrangement the Number of Battallions is greatly reduced, and of Consequence many of the Officers now retained in the Service must retire for the present; but after just & equitable Compensation is made to them, the Saving of Expence will be very great.  Congress are extremely anxious, not only to avoid the Dangers & Embarrassments heretofore experienced by Delays in recruiting the Army until the Opening of the Campaign; but also to establish a permanent Army, of Troops engaged for the War, to consist of such Numbers as may be adequate to the Service, and at the same Time not exceed the Ability of the States to raise & support, and constantly recruit so as to keep up the Number.  It is recommended to the States in the most pressing Manner to have their Regiments completed & in the Field by the first Day of January next at farthest. The Commander in Chief will cause immediate Returns to be made of the Deficiencies of each State according to this Arrangement.(2)  You will observe Sir, that, the respective States are to select from the Line of the Army the Number of Officers to command the several Regiments to them respectively assigned; taking Notice that no new Appointment is to be made of higher Rank than Lieut. Colonel Commandant, for substantial Reasons supposed to be known to all the States.  But the first & immediate Object is to complete the Regiments to their full Number of non Commissioned Officers & Privates; which is recommended in the most pressing Manner as of the greatest Importance.

9304,dg016132,1780,Observations,"""\"" Observations \""
  [October 6-16? 1780] (1) Sketch of the Observations on the boundary between the Spanish Settlements & the United States (by de Marbois) (2) The King of France though anxious to effect the Triple alliance, yet thinkg. the pretensions on both sides exorbitant, did not chuse  OCTOBER 6, 1780  to interfere in support of either. But directed his Ministers at Phila. & Madrid to press the importance of mutual concessions. With this view the former represents to Congress the necessity of concentrating the force agst. the common enemy, for want of which the events of the present campaign have proved inadequate to the exertions. The advantages of an alliance are obvious, in case of a negociation for peace. It will be conducted with perfect harmony between the 3 allied powers. The Spaniards will be as much disposed as the french to support the just claims of U. States. They will not threaten to make a peace excluding them if the others shall be satisfied-on pretence that they are tied to France only, and had no motives to exhaust their resources for a people whose ambition prevented a treaty with a power on whom their safety depended. a continental war to be dreaded by France, as it depends on the death of 2 crowned heads old & sickly and it is 18 years since she was engaged in one-Hence the necessity of seeking a present peace by united efforts. Another advantage of an Alliance arises from the impression an acknowledgmt. of independence would make on other Powers of Europe, and on England herself.  The necessity of the Alliance being shewn the means of bringing it about are next to be considered, the observations on which are to be taken not as ministerial communications, but the private sentiments of one more impartially attached to the good of both parties, than acquainted with the pretensions of either.  Spain claims the exclusive navigation of the Mississippi; and as much I can guess that part of the continent which lies eastward of the Mississippi & formerly called the Orientalis Louisiana. On this head the following objections were suggested by the Committee to the french minister in Jany. last, when urging the necessity of satisfying Spain.(3)  Obj: 1. The Charters of the Southern States forbid such a cession. Answer. The transactions of a power with its own subjects [is] not binding on another power unless communicated, acknowledged, and in a case like the present, unless actual possession can be pleaded. were it otherwise perpetual contests wd. prevail among the Southern powers of Europe, as they have most of them granted such [charters at sundry] (4) times to [their subjects.] The charters of the Colonies [interfere with each other,] most of them having disputes not only with their neigh[bours, but with those] at a distance how then can they be a rule for another [power? How will it ap]pear for the States at the time they are requesting of Spain [an acknowledgment of their] independence to apply to the very record which is the proof [of their subjection? Is it] not plain that in such a case, there is no other solid [plea but actual occupation], or at least a former public manifest possission? The King of Spain however will not recur to these arguments: he will only say-those lands have been ceded 18 years ago by france to G.B. (treaty of  Paris 63. art. 7) not to the Colonies. If they become the property of any common enemy, I have a full right to make the conquest of and so I do.  Obj: 2. The lands in question [are] necessary to the safety & prosperity of the States.  Ans: This is not certain. The case of Vermont, Kentucke & some Counties in Massachussets, show the danger of such ext[ensiv]e territories. It is in vain to attempt to convince either party that their claims are agst. their interest, as they are the best judges of it. It rests therefore on the respective possibility of making the conquest, and it may be left even to a partial judge to decide on this point.  Obj: 3. Spain would take advantage of the present situation of the United States to Treat with them on unequal principles.  Ans: This is the case in 99 treaties of a 100-no such inequality- rather on the side of America. Spain will acknowledge her independence and does not need hers to be so. Spain will grant commercial and very likely other advantages and can not expect the same from America. The benefits she is to reap are not of such a positive nature.  Obj: 4. If these demands were granted Spain might think herself entitled to the demand or conquest of Georgia, Penobscot, N. York &c.  Ans: This objection is extravagant & cannot be seriously made. The most explicit assurances on this point might at any time be obtained.  Obj: 5. Such conduct in Spain neithe[r generous] nor liberal.  Ans: The Spanish Ministry have probably on this said to the French Ambassador that the conduct of the Arnericans is neither liberal nor generous.  Obj: 6. A war even a long war preferable to such conditions.  Ans: A Patient extremely ill might as well say to his Phycician death is better than not to drink spirituous liquors & other things not to be found on the island where he was.  Obj: 7. The Spaniards would hereafter be the sacrifices of their own ambition. No unequal treaty can last long-the injured party will soon or later break it.  Ans: The cautiousness of Spain may be trusted to provide agst. this evil. She may perhaps upon better ground suggest the same danger to the States. They will chuse rather however to confine themselves to their right of conquest upon a country possessed by their Enemy.  Obj: 8. The territory cannot be given up with out the previous consent of the interested States.  Ans: As this argumt. is founded on the charters, if it be valid, it would prove that no treaty would be valid unless it secured to the States [the lands] as far as the South Sea.  In this manner would reason a Minister of the [Court of Spain,  and it would seem] no solid objection could be made to it. If any restricti[ons ought to be laid on these princi]ples, they ought to be taken from the actual settlement [of Americans on the territories] claimed by the Spaniards. By settlement is mea[nt, not temporary incursions] of a few troops, but actual occupancy supported [by the exercise of jurisdiction, and] by building of houses, clearing & inhabiting the [land, &c., without contradiction. Here an] impartial mediator might find the line to be drawn be[tween the contending parties. But I shall] Confine myself to represent to the friends of this case that[, in missing the present fair opportunity of ob]taining solid & lasting advantages to run after a shadow & a chimerical object, they expose themselves to the everlasting reproaches of their Country.

  Dear Sir [October 7, 1780] (1) Yesterday I wrote to your Excellency by Mr. Ray. As I then led you to expect Congress went in the Evening upon the Subject of Vermont and altho' there was a great disagreement in Opinion the Debates took a Turn most injurious to New York which could not have <<been> looked for and clearly satisfied me that several States were disposed to support the Independence of our revolted Citizens. The Deleg[ates] of Pensylvania act under the Influence of Instructions from their Legislature requiring them to consent to no Act of Coercion agt any people friendly to the Revolution nor, to suffer at this critical Conjuncture the Time of Congress to be taken up by the Concerns of any particular State. General Cor[n]el the Delegate from Rhode Island has declard that many of the principal People of that State & the Officers & Soldiers of their Cont. Bat. (2) have accepted Grants under the assumd States. It is even affirmed that the Governour is one & that he has desird the Delegates to take Care of his Interest. General Cornel has candidly confessed that he cannot Vote agt the Independ. of Vermont because it woud in effect Vacate those Grants. The Delegate from Delaware (3) who did not hear a Word of the Evidence pronounced his opinion clearly that Congress coud not interfere. Some other Members doubted their own Authority. Col Bland a New Member from Virginia bluntly proposed a Resolution that Vermont shoud be declared independent tho his Coleagues are of a different opinion; nor was he seconded.(4)  Nothing therefore is to be expected from Congress.(5) The Embarrasmt of our publick Affairs & the bold Declarations of the Vermonters that they have allies & can make a separate peace are not I presume without Influence on this Occasion. But the Acts of our Antagonists & the shameful prostitution of the disputed lands to gain a party in some of the States have in my Judgement no inconsiderable weight.  I am of Opinion that our Legislature must depend on their own Wisdom to manage this-unhappy Business. I refer you to Mr. Knolton who has acted with the utmost firmness, Diligence & propriety for further Information.  The Time of my retiring from Congress swiftly approaches merely for want of a Supply of money to defray necessary Expences. I feel myself Hurt to be obliged to mention this Subject again. But it is  OCTOBER 7, 1780  necessary that I may not be censured. With the utmost Respect I beg Leave to assure your Excellency that I am &c  ""

Gile to procure the necessary Cloathing for our new regiment has been Supplied with Shirts and other Cloathing Sufficient for those Troops and I believe left this place Eight or ten days Ago. Six hundred Tents are preparing for the Southern Army and will be ready (the Board of War say) and Sent forward in about three or four Weeks. These are all that Can be had at this place and will be insufficient to supply the Army to the Southward, and as they will I suppose be immediately to Virginia the regiment At Annapolis will have but little Chance in Coming upon a part of them unless they Shall have joined the Army before the Tents Arrive. A great quantity of Canvas is now lying And has been for Some time at Boston-yet so it has been managed that it has not been brought forward. And the Season being so far Advanced, our people must I am afraid Suffer greatly before it Can be transported So great a distance. Andrie was hanged on Monday last. He made no discoveries.

Jenifer left Town earlier than I expected,(2) or I should have sent it by him. I am hoping to find it is agreeable to Mrs. Lees taste. This and every other command of hers I shall execute with peculiar pleasure.  I propose to be at the Assembly but have little hopes that it will be at the commencement of it. The enquiries that are made on this head are very flattering to my vanity. You have never as yet found Time to acknowledge a voluminous letter of mine,(3) drawn from me by a passage in one of yours of a former Date in which something is suggested, very similar to what is contained in your last. You will there find my opinion of the to whom you allude; nothing can give me so much pleasure as being the happy instrument of communicating \""complete Satisfaction\"" to them. I would speake to you with freedom, but the danger of having ones letters opened, requires a degree of caution. The to whom you allude is extremely delicious; the evening Society of such Company is more desireable than all the celebrated Wits of the Augustan Age.  In my former letter of to Day (4) you will receive information respecting Tents for the Northern Army and Clothing for the New Regts.  Give my Complements to Mrs. Lee and believe me to be with Sincerity & affection Yr, J. Henry  ""

  [October 9, 1780] Octr. 9th. Since writing the within have recd. yours per Mr. Sharpe, and was really astonished at your mention of not having recd. a Line from me, since you left this City, as I have wrote you three long Epistles (1) beside the present, and certainly some extraordinary mishap befals them on the Road, it is no neglect of mine, as I have embraced several direct opportunities to your place, in order to communicate what events, worthy your Attention, had taken place, since you left us. I have no particular matter to engage your attention now, except our wretched prospect of succeeding in our great Enterprise, and for a moment view this Continent contending with the most powerful people on Earth, without one shilling of Money in the Treasury, no public Magazines of Provisions, Forage &c laid up for the Army which during this Campaign have been ten times without Bread, and as often without one mouth full of Meat, notwithstanding there is a great plenty in the Country, in fact we have nothing to buy it with, but Certificates issued by the Commissary & of these the People are quite tired, and when it is to grow better I know not, as I am very apprehensive the new Emission will not have a Circulation, when the attempt is made. Are you not alarmed at our Situation? must confess I am exceedingly; perhaps it may arise from my natural Timidity, but the more I reflect on our affairs, the more gloomy prospects throw themselves within my View. Amidst all our domestic Inefficiency, our Allies appear to be at least inactive; the Armament sent to our Relief has been locked up in Rhode Island, ever since their Arrival. The British, by the latest accounts, keep the command of the Channel, having, by putting to Sea early, prevented the Junction of the combined Fleets, and notwithstanding the very great superiority of the combined Fleets in the West Indies, they have been hitherto inactive, and at last dwindled to nothing, in short, I know not what is to become of us.  I observe with pain the Restrictions you are obliged to make on Genl. Gates's Conduct, and have since the Recpt. of your Letter prevailed on Congress to direct Genl. Washinton to order a Court of Enquiry into his Conduct and to send a proper Officer to succeed him, I dont yet know who it will be, but have some Expectation it will be Green.  I write Mr. Hart per this opportunity relative to his little Daughter, and find there is some small Difficulty in Mr. Morris's setling her Accts as Mrs. Bordeau seems to press very much for the payments to be made in Specie, I waited on Mrs. Bordeau on the Business and she informs me that it is necessary that her several Masters should be paid in Specie, as they would not engage to receive Paper. I believe  OCTOBER 9, 1780  it would be well that Col. Hart transmit to Mr. Morris a Sum in Specie to answer their Demands, it being disagreeable to every person here to make advances of Money, as they are all engaged in Speculations of one kind or other. For my part it is not in my power to make advances, as it will be with great difficulty I shall be able to get away without borrowing which must have been the case, had I not sent home for a considerable Sum.

  Dear Sir Philadela. Octr. 9th. 1780 Before Majr. Giles left Town we had some expectations of procuring a number of Tents from the State of Pennsylvania, but they have since informed us, through their Delegates that they cannot supply us. The Board of War will have in the course of four weeks six hundred for the Southern Army. As many as may be necessary for the New raised Regt. we shall request to be sent to Annapolis or such place as you may direct. If there are other recruits who will stand in need of them, we beg to be informed of it.  The Shirts which detained Majr. Giles' officer was ready some Days ago, and we suppose he is now on his way to Maryland with the Clothing.  Mr. Matlock the Secretary of Pennsylvania informed us yesterday that they had received intelligence of an embarkation of all Regts, now going forward at New-York. It is spoken of with some Confidence. We have received no Intimation of it from the General, which induces us to believe, the report is groundlless, as we cannot suppose so important a movement would escape his observation.  Major Andrie the British adjutant was executed on Monday last. He disclosed nothing as was reported; but observed to those who were about him that he died like a Soldier & a Man of Honor, lamenting the failure of his enterprizes and rejoicing that he died for his King and Country. The General has not informed Congress of the particulars of this transaction, when he does we shall have the Honor of communicating them to you.  Congress has directed the Commander in chief to hold a Court of inquiry on the Conduct of Majr. General Gates in the late Action near Camden and to appoint an officer to take the command of the Southern Army. General Smallwood has lately been honoured with the command of all the Militia of North Carolina by the General Assembly of that State.  Congress is happy to find that the requisition for cattle is likely to be carried into effect; we hope as little delay as possible will attend this Business. The distresses of the Army still continue and we wish  OCTOBER 9, 1780  we could point out to you the period when they would probably terminate. We have the honor to be, Sir with the highest respect and Esteem your obedient Servants,  Geo. Plater  J. Henry.  ""

  Committee of Congress, Committee Chamber Monday October 9. 1780  Present Hnble Thos. McKean, Mr. Walker and Mr. Matlack.(1)  Mr. Gibson, Mr. Forman (2)  Letter from F. Hopkinson Esqr. dated July 6th. 1780 to Comte. of Congress, was read.(3)  Of undue Pride and insolence of Office.  Mr. Hopkinsons evidence and Mr. Palfreys evidence was given in substance, nearly in the words given by the evidence.  After the Committee had expressed their sentiments of the conduct of Mr Gibson & Mr Forman in appealing to the representatives of the respective states in writing upon their case now in hearing, and declaring they considered the same as a farther disrespect of the Committee-and having refused to admit their written defence so applied to be read (4)-- Agreed, To proceed in rehearing the Whole evidence as if the same had not been heard-And thereupon Mr. Hopkinson offered in evidence .(5)  Mr. Saml. Caldwell, Having been employed by the Bd. of W. in purchasing cloathing at the desire of that Bd. he waited on the Treasury-lest any explanation he could give of his contracts might be wanted-at some times the doorway shut, wch. he mentioned to Mr Gibson. Called one Morning 10 oClock. Lee came out & asked what was his business. Caldwell replied he called (as above) upon some accots. exhibitted-he went in, and Caldwell returned & said the Board could not be seen at that hour-in a manner not quite civil or decent-that they had published their duty and they ought to be regarded-hours were 9 & 12, 2 & 5. Called again at 12 oclock, & saw Mr Gibson and opened his business. The state of the Treasury would not admit of payment but in certificates-he observed some of the contracts did not require money and they might have satisfyed them any day from then to the day of contract-& explained it to OCTOBER 9, 1780  Portrait of Timothy Matlack  him-and asked him a question-respecting the propriety of certificates being paid in the case when Bills were contracted for. He G. observed the impossibility of the Public paying their contracts-he G. observed that if justice was not to be attended to it was in vain to apply for it. Applyed to B. Wr.-and was informed that B.T. would now attend it. He applied & met Mr Foreman ought of their hours who did not understand the business-and declared that the business, had never been laid before the business [board?]- but it appeared notwithstanding in the minutes. Mr. F. said there was a lapse some where-for that it had never come to the Knowledge of the board. C. refered to the Minutes-F. could not find it, but C. showed it him-he said it must have been when he was abroad for six weeks. C. said it had been neglected in the treasury office.  Qu[estion]. Mr. F. Hopkinson. For what particular purpose was that contract made?  A[nswer]. To Supply the first Virginia troops with cloathing; which I was informed they could not proceed without them.  Qu. Have the Treasury board compleated that contract; is the amount paid?  An. No: not a farthing of it. I ought to have said that Mr. Gibson requested the state of the Contract to be committed to writing.  Qu. Have the Treasury board issued any warrants for the payment of their Contracts?  A. No. those Contracts were principally for the use of the troops Marching to the Southward-some few for other purposes.  Qu. by Mr. Gibson. What was it that Mr Forman had said to you?  An. That Mr Forman said he would answer upon his Memory that it had not been made to the board on the business. Afterwards that it must have been Made in his six weeks absence-And that he was very much surprised to hear him say that Justice was not concerned in it.  Qu. What was it that the Board of war answered to you?  An. That the Board of war found fault with the Treasury for delays. The words not remembered; but this was the sentinent.  Qu. Repeated.  An. That the Board, in their conversation on the subject blamed the Treasury as raising unnecessary delays and objections in their business.  Qu. by Mr Forman. Was this application to the Treasury from the Board of war; or from the Congress?  An. He did not certainly know, but supposed from the Board of War.  Qu. by Mr Gibson. Was you ever treated by the Treasury or any of them with undue pride or insolence &c?  An. Except in the instance of the reply, that they were not considering the justice of the case-And that he thought Mr. Forman  therefore was irritated by the earnestness of his (C.) applications. Obs[ervation]. By Mr. Hopkinson. That the Time he had in examining this evidence cannot ascertain whether the end for which the authority was given B.T. was answered.  Mr. Pettit.(6) Has had much business with the Treasury; some to his satisfaction, some otherwise. Has only one personal complaint. Some time last spring he applied to B.T. on some business, knocked at the door and hearing somebody within, supposed he was invited in as is usual. He went in and was met by one of the board who appeared frustrated-and told him the board did no business at that hour- he informed them his business was very short & was urgent, and pressed earnestly but decently to be heard: he was informed that he could not be heard then.  Mr P. then asked at what hour he might be heard in terms in which he endeavoured to be respectful & to suppress his feeling-it was replied at 12 o'clock.  Mr P. then walked round a square and came as near to 12 as he could which he affected within 5 Min.-the board was then risen & his business delayed.  qu. By Mr Forman. What Member of the board met you at the door?  An. Mr. Forman.  qu. by Do [i.e. Forman]. Did I treat you disrespectfully?  An. No. so far as was consistent with getting me peremptorily out of the room.  Qu. by Mr Gibson. Was you ever treated by any of the board with any undue pride or insolence of office?  An. When I have had occasion to apply personally I have been treated with civility: the only appearance of incivility was in the instance mentioned [. . .] only those which are referred to in the written [. . .]sy between us.  qu. by Mr McKean. Were you personally offended in those letters?  An: In one instance I thought I was; but perhaps I was not a judge n [ ] Case.  Q. by Mr. Gibson to Mr. Hopkinson. Did I ever treat you with insolence or undue Pride?  A. I don't know that you ever did. Mr. Forman did so.  Mr. Hopkinson-as to the Charge of incorrect & absurd orders from the board of Treasury.  Of which Mr. Hopkinson produced the following Instances viz.  1 of the 1st June.  2 of the 25th July.  3 of the 28th June.  4 of the 24 July.  5 of the 29 Sept.  6 of the 18 Sept.   7 The same set of Bills of Exchange differing in Tenor. Mr. Hopkinson by Letter submitted the propriety of preventing the Issuing of said bills-but they were emitted.  Mr. Gibsons Ques. to Mr. Delany.(8) In your Interview with F. how were you treated?  A. With due Civilty. No disputes had hapned between them.  Mr. Jas Mease (9)-has always been civilly treated by the Board.  Mr. Dunlap.(10) Complains of Negligence in the Settlement of an acct. for printing Loan Office Certificates done 18 months ago & not paid yet.  Mr. Hopkinson. Says that the board of Treasury have not passed upon any account of his for six months past, tho two of them have been before the board for abt. that time.  Mr. Geddis. Observed, That one account of Mr. Hopkinsons would have been twice passed; but for the care of the Chamber of Accots.  An Altercation between Mr. Hopkinson & the Commissioners respecting the word \""injury\""-not material in the case.  Mr. Blaine. (11) Qu . Have the Commissioners of the Treasury ever behaved with insolence in office?  An. No. I have not had any very frequent transactions but in the instances I have, the Board have behaved very respectfully and I have been readily dispatched; Except in some late cases, when I have reason to believe there was not money.  Mr. Hillegas.(12) I have heard frequent complaints; and have mentioned them before; but I was wrong as it is but hearsay evidence.  <<That of the Loan Office Commissioners acknowledge the receipt of Certificates and credit them in their account; N.B. This relates to a former board.>  That he has a very particular reproof given him in consequence of his paying a small order of 100 dollars or thereabout to the Doorkeeper of Congress & for paying the like sums some foreigners. That in a Case of mere forwarding of business in sending money &c the Clerks of the Treasury have called & received information from him verbally. Upon which return was made in writing that the information must be given in writing which he accordingly did.  (here he repeated the Case of a Man expressing surprize at the payment &c) Also the Case of Mr. Lee.(13)  Mr Geddis-observed That the permission for Mr Nicholson to leave the Commissioners of Accounts was in Writing.  Mr. Nicholson. Applied to the Treasury on being summoned to appear without his arms &c and obtained a permission in writing from the board of the Treasury.  Mr Geddis. Observed, That Mr Nicholson had been long encouraged in a disregard of the Chamber of accounts.  Mr. Thomas Smith. In transacting business with the Treasury My applications have been attended to and readily dispatched-,  til lately they were generally personally-lately I have called and had My business done as heretofore; but was at the same time informed that the business must in future be done in writing, which it struck me was proper, and has been accordingly complied with on my part. I have been treated with decency and propriety. The Nature of my business with treasury has been short-and my orders have been in writing.  Qu. By Mr. McKean. Have you reced any incorrect or inconsistent orders?  An. I have some idea of somethings of this kind; but cannot now recollect what they were-not things of any great Consequence. In examining some Accts. of Mr. Hopkinsons there was some error in consequence of some eight bills returned as damaged each 36 dollars, which probably arose from it being not attended to that they were returned as damaged.(14) ""

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia, Oct. 10, 1780 I do myself the honour to write to your Excellency by this day's post; and when I reflect that I have been honoured by only two letters from you since I arrived at this place,(1) I fear my scrolls have been disagreeable, but shall continue them until I am informed.  The arrangements of the army hath passed in Congress in the same form I mentioned in my last.(2) So far as respects the reducing officers, is referred to General Washington for his opinion on the mode proposed before it will be published. So far as it respects the number of troops and time of service for the ensuing year, is ordered to be sent to the respective States,(3) which I apprehend you will receive before this will reach you, by which you will see our quota is five hundred and eighty non-commissioned officers and privates. I trust the State will have no objection to the number, and I flatter myself they will take measures to have the quota compleated for the war, and in the field by the time limited, at least it is my most earnest wish; and I hope to be so happy as to have the Honourable General Assembly to concur with me in sentiments.  Congress is busily employed in Committee and otherwise, in reducing the public expences and devising ways and means for raising money and supplies, and preparing an estimate of the national expense for the year ensuing.  The affair of the Hampshire grants is yet before Congress undetermined, and I am not able to say positively what will be done, but have reason to believe Commissioners will be appointed agreeable to the confederation, to enquire into and settle the claims between the States of New York and New Hampshire, and report to Congress: after which it is probable the independence of Vermont will be taken into consideration.  Congress have ordered an enquiry to be made into General Gates's  OCTOBER 10, 1780  conduct during his command to the southward, and that he be suspended from his command until such enquiry be made; and directed General Washington to send a Major General to take the command of the southern army.  Your Excellency was pleased to inform, in your letter of the 25th of July, that the General Assembly had, at their last session, adopted the resolution of Congress of the 18th of March last, and fixed sufficient funds for the redemption of the State's quota. I expected the act would have been sent forward long before this, but as it hath not come to hand, I wish to know the reason, that I may be able to answer Congress when I am called upon, which hath been done often.(4) I have not the least doubt but it hath been kept back upon just principles, and I wish the prospect of the new bills having a quick circulation, was greater than I have any assurance of in those States that have received them.  Congress last week compleated the system of the hospital department,(5) and made choice of the necessary surgeons, physicians, and hospital officers, by which means more than fifty surgeons, &c. have gone to the right about by the number being lessened, by which means I am sure much money will be saved, and I trust the sick will be better taken care of.

  My dear General, Philadelphia 10th October 1780 Yesterday I had the Honour of your Excellency's very friendly Letter of the 4th Instant (1) for which be pleased to accept my warmest Thanks.  Before this reaches your Hands you will have received the new Arrangement of the Army, submitted, as it is, to your Opinion it is only to be considered as an Essay open to such Alterations as you may suggest. The Idea of a Majority of Congress was clear that it woud be too hazardous to risk the Defence of America on the practicability of drawing an Army for the War into the Field by the first of January: the Alternative therefore, as you will find it guarded, was thought necessary tho' All admitted a permanent Force to be most desireable. I saw and explained the danger of an Alternative however cautiously expressed. The States may think they do enough if they comply with either of the Injunctions; and, while Men who make Arms a profession, have a prospect of being annually retained, for high premiums, they will hardly tie themselves at once for the War.  In the original proposition there was another Alternative-for the war, or for three years, besides that which gives your Excellency so much and such Just Apprehension: This last was rejected by a Majority: perhaps unfortunately as in the opinion of many it strengthend the Reasons for the annual Supply By drafts. I do not think it too late to correct this Error if pointed out with the Force that every thing falls from your Pen. The manner of Reduction is I am confident liable to great Objection, and I have no doubt but you will suggest a Rule or principle as Seniority or any thing you may think better, which will avoid the difficulty you suggest and meet with Approbation: for I do not conceive that a single Member will be tenacious of the provision on this Article. Indeed I am perswaded that your Excellency's Representations on this and every Subject will have as much Influence as you can wish, and that on this particular Occasion nothing but a Clear Conviction of Impracticability will induce Congress to overrule your Opinion.(2) A false Estimate of the power and Perseverance of our Enemies was friendly to the present Revolution: and inspired that Confidence of Success in all Ranks of people, which was necessary to unite them in so arduous a Cause. You cannot forget the Opinions which were Current on this Floor at the first and second Congresses and how firmly they established this Error. We seem to part with it with Reluctance; it still hangs heavy upon us; and has produced the Indecision the Expedients and the Debility of which you complain. I hope Misfortunes and distresses will at length rouse us to Just  OCTOBER 10, 1780  Sentiments and vigorous Exertions; and with your Excellency I pray God That the fatal Delusion which has marked our Conduct may end here.  When the Enemy turn their Eyes to the Southward they see too much Imbecility not to be encourged to attempt to extend their Conquest and improve Advantages which they have derived in no small Degree from our own Temerity and Misconduct: I believe we shall not want Men to oppose them, Virginia having made Efforts the Expansiveness of which is incredible, and North Carolina being equally disposed to act vigorously tho' not so capable to raise their Quota for a fixed and certain period. I wish we may have it in our power to provide the necessary Supplies: your Excellency too well knows and feels our difficulties and Embarrasments, and that they are only to be surmounted by great Exertions. I flatter myself that you do me no more than Justice in believing that Duty and Inclination equally demand my Assiduous Endeavours to correct our past Errors and draw forth our Resources.  I am much obliged to your Excellency for your Account of the Interview at Hartford;(3) and beg you to believe that no Man can be with greater Affection and personal Estatchment, than I am, My dear General, Your most Obedient and very humble Servant,  Jas Duane ""

As to the Election I care not how it has been determined and Shall never be anxious of representing a people who are to be alltogether influenced by two or three Ignorent Dutchmen.

He was asked at the Gallows if he had Any thing to Say. His Answer was that he was not afraid to dye, That he was prepared for it, but was Concerned at the manner, he would much rather have been Shot, desired that it might be taken notice that his behavour at his Execution was Such as became a Gentleman and a Soldier. He was dressed in a new Suit of Regimentals with his Sword by his Side. His friend Smith it is said will Share the Same fate in a few days. Old Franks of this City is taken up on Suspicion of Treasonable practices and Imprisoned. His Son one of Arnolds Aids it is said is gone off.  On the 5th Instant the Commander in Chief by a Resolve of Congress is directed to order a Court of inquiry on the Conduct of Gen Gates, and to appoint an officer to take the Command of the Southern Army untill such inquiry be made. Some honorable notice will be taken of the Baron de Kalb who fell so gloriously in the Cause of America And the thanks of Congress will be returned to Generals Smallwood & Gist, and to the Officers and men under their Command for their Conduct and bravery in the late Action near Camden.  All expectations of the Arrival of the French fleet are at an End. Ternay by erecting fortifications on different parts of Rhode Island has secured His fleet and the Army Against Any Attempts of the Enemy-this being the Case, and Clinton haveing failed in his designs Against West Point, it is more than probable His next object will be to the Southward. The Climate is favourable for a Winter Campaign, and a Considerable number of men may be Spared from New York without Hazarding that place, as no Attempt Can be made by us on that place with any prospect of Success while the Enemy is so far Superior at Sea. Mr. Faw tells me he is to sell George-at £100 gold in Case he Can get no more. This is a low price when it is Considered gold is depreciated at best 100 Per Cent, however it is better to part with him at allmost Any price than exercise the Cruelty which would be necessary to oblige him to Stay with you.

  Dear Sir Philada. Octr. 10. 1780. I recd. your favrs. of 10 & 14 ulto. by Mr. Sharp, for which I am much obliged to you. Genl. Washington is directed to order a Court of Inquiry on the Conduct of Genl. Gates and to appoint an Officer to take the Command of the Southern Army, until the Inquiry shall be made.  I wrote to you fully on the 1st instt., & another short Lettr., subsequent, Per favr. of Mr. Stanley. (1) In the first of these I informed you that the Board of War had procured 800 Tents for the Southern Army; when they told me so, they counted upon 300 Tents, which they made no doubt of obtaining from the Executive of this State, in which however they were disapponted, and this reduces the Number to 500, and I fear it will be a considerable time before they can be forwarded.  It was yesterday reported that eleven Regiments had embarked at New York, bound into Chesapeak Bay. Had I not the utmost Confidence in the consummate Virtue & Wisdom of Genl. Washington, I should murmur that greater Reinforcements have not been detached from the Grand Army to march to the Southward. Colo. De Buisson told me that he met the new Maryland Regiment, on its March to Carolina, (which was complete in number of Men when they left this) and that it was reduced by Desertion to about 150 Men: I flatter myself the Colo. was mistaken.  I expect the British will make vigorous Efforts against No. Carolina OCTOBER 10, 1780  in the Course of the ensuing Winter; but as Virginia seems to be somewhat roused from the Lethargy in which she slept, and the Spirit of our Coutrymen is yet unbroken, I make no doubt they will in the End prove ineffectual.  Colo. Andrie was executed the 2d instt.  He refused to disclose any thing, and died like a gallant Soldier. My Compliments to Mrs. Nash & my Friends at Newbern. I am, Dear Sir, Your most obedt.

The main french fleet under Guichen left the West OCTOBER 10, 1780  Indies about the time first mentioned with a large fleet of Merchantmen under its convoy, and has not since been heard of. The residue of the french fleet is in the W. Indies but we do not hear of their being any way employed. It is said an English expedition is preparing at Jamaica against some of the Spanish Settlements. The Spanish expeditions against the Floridas I believe I mentioned in my last.  We have private accounts through a channel which has seldom deceived that a very large embarkation is still going on at N. York. I hope Virginia will not be surprized in case she should be the meditated victim.  Andre was hung as a spy on the 2d inst. Clinton made a frivolous attempt to save him by pleading the passport granted by Arnold. He submitted to his fate in a manner that shewed him to be worthy of a better one. His coadjutor Smith will soon follow him. The Hero of the Plot, although he may for the present escape an ignominious death must lead an ignominious life which if any of his feelings remain will be a sorer punishment. It is said that he is to be made a Brigadier and employed in some predatory expedition against the Spaniards in which he may gratify his thirst for gold. It is said with more probability that his baseness is universally despised by those who have taken advantage of it, and that some degree of resentment is mixed with their contempt on account of the loss of their darling officer to which he was accessory. With sincere regard, I am Dr. Sir yr obt & humbl servt. James Madison Junr.  ""

9331,dg016159,1780,Charles Thomson to John Jay,"""Charles Thomson to John Jay
  Sir, Philada Octr. 12. 1780 I have received your letter of 27 May And the duplicate with the Prints for which I am much obliged and will embrace the first oppertunity of transmitting one set of the Prints agreeable to your request to Gen. Schuyler. (1) I have been anxious with respect to your being informed regularly of what is passing here. Many things have happened of which you ought to be acquainted. I perceive the OCTOBER 12, 1780  Minister of Spain is desirous to know the state of our Finances. They have undergone a considerable change since you left us, particularly with regard to the Money or paper bills heretofore emitted for the purpose of carrying on the War. On this subject though I can explain myself to you it will be no easy Matter for you to give a satisfactory account to people in Europe, who are entire strangers to our paper Money. And yet this ought to be done to prevent the ill impressions that may be made by the clamours of disappointed Men who hoped to accumulate Mountains of wealth from our Misfortunes. Congress having before your departure resolved not to emit a greater quantity of bills than 200 Millions dollars, and having in order to stop a farther depreciation & fix the value that seem settled by the Mode of redeeming it by an annual Assesment for eighteen years found themselves Under a necessity to call upon the states to raise by taxes the sum of 15 millions a Month in order to carry on the war. But as the legislatures were slow in raising the taxes & the demands of the public were pressing the people found they were sollicited to sell, before the want of Money urged them, and consequently foreseeing that taxes would be great, every one determined to ease himself and make his own particular burden as light as possible by raising the price of the commodities wanted. The result of this was that the paper depreciated more than ever, And the Monthly Assessments when paid in were found to be No way adequate to the public demands in as much as every thing wanted for the Army was by the month of January raised to double the Nominal price of what it was in the Month of October when you left us. The Merchants & traders who imported foreign articles & Who are always watchful to secure themselves taking advantage of the depreciation raised the price of their Commodities to an enormous degree so that the commonwealth lay like a ship stranded Whose mariners instead of exerting themselves to save her, were Wholly employed in securing to themselves as much of the Cargo as possible leaving her to the mercy of winds & Waves. In order to supply the Wants of the Army Which could not be provided for by taxes Congress in the Month of Feby called on the several states for specific supplies of provisions & forage. But before these could be brought in, such advantage was taken of the public wants which were wholly supplied by purchase on credit, that the Nominal debt of the Continent was increased Almost beyond calculation. Of this you will easily judge when you are informed that in the month of March commodities were sold in the Market of Philadelphia at four times the price they were in the Month of September. In short a continental dollar was valued at no more than a penny half penny & in many Instances at not more than a penny so that the depreciation was fluctuating from 60 to 90 for one And Nobody knew where it would settle. Upon this Our enemies took courage and flattering themselves that Congress must soon sink under   these embarassments, they set every engine to Work to continue & encrease them by counterfeiting the currency, multiplying their emissaries to deny its credit, tampering with our Army and at the same time prosecuting the War with a greater degree of vigour than they had done from the commencement of it. To the honour of our country I must inform you that history cannot produce such Instances of fortitude, patience & perseverance as were exhibited by our virtious Army. Though exposed to hunger & nakedness amidst the rigours of a most inclement winter they struggled through with unparrelled firmness & notwithstanding the tempting bribes and offers of the enemy And the incredible hardships they suffered the desertions were comparatively few.  Congress finding it necessary, in order to baffle the designs of our enemy and curb intestine avarice to adopt more decided Measures, resolved on the 18 March to call in by taxes & burn all the Money heretofore emitted to the amount of 200 Millions of dollars in the Course of one year And in lieu thereof to issue Ten Millions new money which was to be issued as fast and no faster than the old was brought in, At the rate of 20 of the old for one of the new. And it was resolved that in the payment of taxes gold and silver should be received at the rate of 40 for one, at which rate also the new money was to be received by Which means its value was fixed & those Who had amassed large quantities of the old paper were disappointed in their hopes of Converting it into gold. They proceeded further and fixed the value of certificates for money loaned from Sept 1777 to March 1780 rating the value of the money on every day between those two periods, that the lender might receive the full value of the Money lent both in principal And Interest and that the public Might not be loaded with a debt for which they received no equivolent. For it was urged with great reason as contrary to every rule of right and Justice that the landed property which is the principal object of taxation should be loaded with the burden of paying off a certificate for Instance of two hundred dollars, which was procured with the price of three bushels of wheat and less with that Number of silver dollars which are in reallity Worth from 80 to 100 times the value of the Money lent. These regulations were deemed so just & equitable that the people acquiesed and the states have generally enacted laws conformable thereto. By these means the debt incurred by a War of six years was fixed at about one or two & twenty Millions of dollars-a War which has cost our enimies upwards of sixty Millions sterling. I ought to have observed to you that of the ten millions to be issued in lieu of the 200 Millions which were ordered to be paid in by taxes & burned Congress assigned six Millions to the states to enable them to purchase the specific articles required of them, reserving 4 Millions for paying the Army and defraying the expences of transportation and other incidental charges. But while these  measures were in agitation and before they could be carried into execution, our enemies pressing on the War with vigour, Congress found themselves exceedingly straitened for want of money & were from Necessity forced upon a Measure which I fear will give you and our other Ministers in Europe some trouble I mean that of drawing bills. But here I would just observe that if old established nations populous, rich and powerful whose governments are fixed, whose revenues are settled, who have armies raised, And fleets equipped, whose towns are fortified and whose arsenals and magazines are stored with implements and necessaries for war-if nations such as these find themselves under difficulties for want of money by one or two years war against a nation weakened and greatly exhausted; what wonder, if a young commonwealth, whose inhabitants are poor, scattered over a large extent of country & just emerging from the difficulties of settling a wilderness, having no governments established, no revenues but the voluntary contributions of the people, and who being without arms, without ammunition or military stores were forced into a war with one of the most powerful nations of the world, should after a war of six years find itself embarrassed in its finances and under a necessity of applying for aid to other nations, whose interest it is to humble the power with which it is contending? If England alone, unassisted by a single ally, can give such annoyance to the united arms of France, Spain and America, what must be the consequence, if for want of a little assistance in money she is suffered to triumph over the United States and again subjugate them or a part of them to her Yoke?  To our want of money may chiefly be ascribed the enemy's success in Carolina. For although Congress had timely notice of Sir Henry Clinton's intentions last fall, and notwithstanding his tedious passage and the slowness of his proceedings after his arrival in Carolina, owing to the losses he had sustained by a violent storm on his voyage, yet for want of Money Congress could not forward with sufficient dispatch the succours intended, and consequently the communication between Charlestown and the country was cut off and the enemy had time by regular approaches to force a surrender. After this general Gates was sent to take the command to the southward. The States of Virginia and North Carolina furnished a very considerable body of Militia, with which joined to the Maryland & Delaware regulars consisting of about 1200 men who were on their March to the southward and had been destined for the relief of Charlestown, He began to move forward. But having no tents to cover his men, no magazines of provisions laid up, and no money to procure either, and the country through which he marched being thinly inhabited he was exposed to incredible difficulties and hardships. Having entered South Carolina & broken up the enemy's posts on the river Pedee, as his men were still without shelter and the rainy season was   approaching, in which his troops must suffer greatly for want of tents, encouraged by sundry successes against the enemy's outposts he was induced to march towards Camden with the hopes of driving the enemy from thence and establishing his headquarters in that village, where he would have been able to put his troops under cover and supply them plentifully with provisions, and confine the enemy to the low country, in which case they would have been obliged either to retire into Charlestown and leave him the command of the country, or by attempting to keep the field would have exposed their army in the sickly season to a loss by death equal to a defeat.  Unfortunately he failed in the attempt. The battle of the 16 of August, which you have a particular account of in the public papers, broke up the army he had collected & forced him back into North Carolina. The Maryland and Delaware regulars acquired great honor in that action & had they been properly supported by the Militia would in all probability have made it a glorious day for America. The Character of the general has suffered by his rapid flight, and a court of enquiry is ordered on his conduct. The check, however which the enemy received from the regulars, who did not amount to more than 1000 in the action prevented them from improving the victory they had gained. And the spirited conduct of the militia immediately after the action a party of whom under Col. Marian rescued 150 of our regulars who had been taken prisoners on the 16th and captivated the escort that was conducting them to Charles town, and another party of about 200 under col. Williams on the 19 August engaged between four and five hundred British, killed 60 on the field and took 70 prisoners-this spirited conduct with some other successful enterprizes of less note has reanimated our people and disheartened the enemy, so that the consequences of the defeat are not so distressful as might have been apprehended.  The armies in this quarter have hitherto had an inactive campaign. The arrival of the first division of the French Fleet and army gave us sanguine hopes of regaining New York. But the detention of the second division & the superiority of the British fleet have disappointed our hopes and expectations. The fleets in the West Indies seem to have spent the summer in Maneuvering. Upon the junction of the French and Spanish fleets they directed their course for Jamaica and had they improved the oppertunity, it is the general opinion they would have succeeded & subdued that island without any difficulty, as the garrisons were chiefly withdrawn and there was no fleet to guard the harbour. But by some unaccountable delay they suffered a fleet under Walsingham to get there before them and a reinforcement of troops to be thrown into the Island, which as the hurrican season was coming on rendered the attempt impracticable and secured it at least for the present. Hereupon the combined fleet seperated, the Spanish steered for Havannah & the French put into  Cape Francois. The count de Guishee after some stay left the cape, directed his course Notherly And coasted along our shores. This it is supposed Alarmed Rodney to that degree that anxious for the safety of Fleet & Army at New York he immediatly left the windward island and with a fleet of 14 or 15 sail of the line & some frigates steered for that place where he now is. The late providential discovery of Arnolds plot which appears to have been for a considerable time in agitation has induced a belief that Rodney had something farther in view than meerly counteracting the design of count de Guichen. In a Controversy and revolution such as this where former friendships & intimacies subsisted between the contending parties And where men of upright intentions took different sides & men of all characters were engaged in the contest, it would not have been strange or uncommon if conspiracies had been formed, but to the honor of the American army Arnold is the first and I believe the only American officer Who has during this war entered into a conspiracy to betray his country. You know the character of the Man, he was brave but avaricious, fond of parade and not very scrupulous abt the means of acquiring Money to defray the expences of it. He had married a young woman who had been distinguished by gen Howes Mischianze knights & her Father was not remarkable for attachment to the American cause. The expensive manner in which he lived in Philadelphia reduced his Finances and the accounts he exhibited against the public under went a scrutiny at the board of treasury not much to the advantage of his honor & honesty; which joined to his disappointments in the case of the Active & the result of the court martial instituted on the complaint of the council of Pensylvania soured his temper & rendered him a fit object for Clintons views. By letters found among his private papers it appears that Captain Andree one of Sr. H Clintons aids had commenced a correspondence with Mrs. Arnold in 1779 under pretence of supplying her with Millinary. Whither it was continued till it was ripened into the plot of betraying West Point into the hands of the enemy I will not undertake to say But that the scheme had been some time in agitation appears evidently from this, that while the enemy were making preparations for executing their purpose, And giving out that their design was against Virginia the same reports were circulated in Lord Cornwallis camp in South Carolina, and measures were taken to make us believe he meant to second the expedition by marching through North Carolina & forming a junction with Sr. Henry on his arrival in Virginia. At this time Rodney arrived at New York and it is conjectured the design was as soon as they had gained possession of West Point & cut off the communication between the western & southern states, to turn their whole force against the French fleet & Army at Rhode island. This it is true is but conjecture But it must be confessed the object was great and had Rodney succeeded he would   have finished the year with as much eclat as he began it. The providential discovery of the plot blasted the Schemes of our enemies And what object their next will be time must unfold.  I suppose you will be informed through another channel that after the surrender of Charlestown Mr. Laurence returned to Philadelphia & for some time took his seat in Congress & that after a few weeks stay he embarked for Holland on his first appointment. You will also without doubt hear of Searles embarking for Europe. The design of his going is kept a profound secret but it is Conjectured he is sent on some business of the Council of this state. I am mistaken in the Character of the Man if his business and Mission remain long a secret after his arrival.  Mrs. Thomson requests me to make her compliments to Mrs. Jay, you will please to add Mine.  I am with the truest Sentiments of regard, Sr. yr. most Obedient & humble Servt, Chas Thomson  ""

  Wednesday October 12. 1780 Present Mr McKean, Mr Walker & Mr Matlack.  A letter from C. Pettit DQMG was read & also copies of seven letters which had passed between him & the Board of Treasury.(1) Mr. Gibson & Mr Forman then offered their minutes to show who was present at the board at the time respectively when those letters were reced & written-by which it appears there generally [was] present only one Commissioner and two Members of Congress.  They (Mr Forman & Mr Gibson) then requested their letter to the Committee dated _______ (2) might be read. Whereupon it was observed, That that letter had been handed to the Delegates of the respective states in Union, (3) and, as it had the appearance of an appeal to the states against the Proceedings of the Committee, rather than that of information to the Committee, it was not proper it should be read, and more especially, as the Commissioners were called to answer before the board viva voce and the proceedings was not to be had in writing.  Whereupon reference being had by Mr Gibson & Mr Forman to other papers in which were contained Several charges against the several members of the Chamber of accounts it was requested the same might be read.(4) But, the compliance therewith leading from OCTOBER 12, 1780  the business before the Committee and introducing New charges, which however proper for future consideration, was not proper to be now introduced.  Mr. Geddis requested [ . . . ] they (the Chamber of Accots.) might be enabled to make their defence-offering to copy the whole. The charges contained were read And a further consideration of it referred.  Mr Forman. In defence.  Of shutting the door against Mr. Hopkinson.(5)  Mr Hopkinson having had business with the Treasury Mr Forman mentioned to him what he had heard. Mr. Hopkinson charged him with the fact-Forman positively denied it-Hops. affirmed it-And requested he not to make it a charge agt. the board; but make it a personal affair-this was before the charge was made. Mr Denning says this was the [fact? ] and it was at the time of Mr Hopkinsons attendance at the board respecting the order of the 1st June.  Observes, That Mr. Hopkinson had acknowledged that Mr. Gibson had never personally treated him with disrespect and that he should not insist on it &c.  Regarding Bills of exchange, Circumstances &c.  Mr Hopkinson brought in a bundle of bills on France to be sent to Maryland for the paymt. of interest. Mr Lee was about to open the bundle and Mr For. enquired for what purpose and asked an explanation of Mr Hop. which he explained by a reference to a conference with Mr Gibson, from which Hop. was led to expect the Treasy would forward them-that F. knew it was duty as appears by resolve of Congress 15 July 1778-but nothing during the conversation [ . . .] inconsistent with the character of the Treasury. That the business of the Treasury being as important as that of the Loan office, F. expected Mr. Hopkinson would forward them as was his duty. Mr. Hopkinson observed, that the post declined giving him a receipt, and demanded the direction of the Treasury as to the manner. Mr Forman referred to their order of the 22nd of June, directing him to send them without particular direction in what manner and leaving him to find out the best manner as he had theretofore done.  Mr Denning. H[opkinson's] difficulty was how he was to forward the bills safely for himself-and observed that he would not send them by the post even tho the Treasury should order it; unless he, the post, would give him a receipt for them-there was considerable altercation between Mr Forman & Mr Hop. on this subject. And Mr Hop. insisted upon the board sending them, as they had on several times done. Mr Hop was then a stranger. I mentioned it was his duty to send the bills, even tho' the post would not give a receipt. For. that should he send them it would be under the risque of the Treasury who had ordered it done.   When Mr Hop. had retired Mr F. observed that he thought Mr. H. had taken offence to it said No he thought not-he appeared satisfied.  Mr Hop. upon his having mentioned the obligation on the Treasury to account for the bills on their giving orders, hesitating a moment replied he believed it was right.  Mr. Forman, Asked whether he should send a waiter to carry the bills, to which Mr. H. replied he had brought them and could carry them back again. (To this Mr H. agreed).  Qu. by Mr. Forman to Mr. Denning. Did you hear any expression of mine to Mr. Hop.? unbecoming the address of one Gent. to another?  An. No. They both appeared warm, as was evident from their voices .  Mr. Hopkinson. Insisted that the manner was insolent and haughty, and such he had never before received and hopes he never deserved. That his bringing the bills was in consequence of information given by Mr Gibson, that the post had refused to give him a receipt for the bills and Mr Gibson had desired him to bring the bills to the board and they would give a receipt for them & forward them. That upon Mr Lee's opening the bundle and offering [to account the?] bills, Mr. Forman, in haughty expressions and insolent [voice?] demanded-\""What [ . . . ] is all this? What does that mean? Is this the way of doing business in this board? Mr. Hop. then explained what had passed between him & Mr Gibson, upon which, Mr. Forman, demanded, Have you any written order from the board? To which he answered No. Mr. Forman then said, we will have no business done in this manner-and his expression implied in terms haughtily expressed-that unless there was a written order, He might go. That this was the manner of treatment from Mr. Forman in general and altho the particular [ . . . ] instances, taken singly, it is difficult to describe yet taken together they have been intolerable. To all which Mr. Forman replies, that as often as those charges are made he absolutely denies them.  Mr. Denning. Observed, That he had said to Mr. Hopkinson might safely send, or ought to send, the bills by the Post without taking his receipt, if a written order of the Treasury should be given \""to send them by post without a receipt.\""  Agreed to adjourn to Monday morning 10 o'clock.(6)  ""

Although the duties of my station demand of me to undergo every species of inconvenience & distress, yet I don't think I can with any degree of propriety impose the same task on her. Could I see the least prospect of an alteration for the better, in our affairs, I could be content to wait with patience, but when on the contrary I daily see them grow worse, & the treasury cannot furnish as much money, as will support these few Delegates, who have no other resources, think it sufficient, for me to bear the mortification that must necessarily ensue alone.  There is another reason which renders Mrs Mathews presence indispensibly necessary in Carolina (as it is impossible for me to go there.) I have not a friend remaining in that country, but what are prisoners of War, several are amongst those unfortunate persons sent to St. Augustine: so that my affairs are left entirely at the mercy of Negroes, & an insatiable enemy. As to my own particular property, that I entirely give up, unless we should ever recover the country by force of arms. But as Mrs. Mathews has an Estate there independent of mine, I could wish to put it in her power to save that for herself & family. I am led to expect she will be successful in her application on this head; as our State never confiscated a shilling of the property of the Partisans of the British government, but permitted them to dispose of & retire with it, therefore, however they may dispose of my private estate, they can on no principle whatever with hold from her, her seperate estate. She is now the only person who can with propriety make the claim & discriminate between the two estates.  This sacrifice of domestic felicity, I think we owe to our posterity, that they might not be left totally destitute.  P.M. Since writing the above, we have received letters from the southward. A copy of Genl. Gates's, with it's inclosures will be transmitted you by the President. But our Delegates have one from Governor Rutledge which speaks much plainer than Gates does.(1) He is likewise on the spot. I expect Hallifax in North Carolina will be Lord Cornwallis Head quarters in less than a month, unless some very vigorous and decisive measures are immediately taken to reinforce the Southern army-not with Militias but regular troops, that can be kept together, and depended on. The British army, in full force, is now between Gates, & the most fertile, best effected, & most populous part of No. Carolina, so that every resource of men & provisions, are now entirely cut off from thence. The people in every part of the country are flying before the enemy, & endeavouring  OCTOBER 16, 1780  to save what part of their property they can. Gates's army is very weak, especially in cavalry, & the enemy are very strong. The last accounts we have of them, they were three miles this side of Charlotte in full march. I see nothing to prevent their pursuing any route they please, through any part of No. Carolina. I am extremely anxious to hear, who the person is, appointed to the Southern Command. I hope your Excy. will find it eligible to confer it on Genl. Greene, as the person that I am convinced will be highly acceptable to all the Southern States. An able commander was never more wanted than is now in that quarter, & the sooner he gets there, the better.  I will just take the liberty of asking yr. Excy. whether you think it would be possible to spare Majr. Lee's corps to act with the southern army this Winter for after all the exertions they have made there in the course of six months, they have equiped no more than 82 horse.  I should be obliged to you sir, to inform me of the result of your application to Sr. Hy. Clinton as soon as you conveniently can.  I have received your Excys favor of the 4th inst.(2) but have not time to reply to it at present.

  My Dear sir, Philadelphia Octo. 16th 1780 The Saratoga one of the Continental frigates, is just returned from a Cruize of about four Weeks and has taken four Jamaica men, with rum and sugar-one of them mounted 22 Guns, one 20, and another 18. She was parted from her prizes a few nights Ago, in a fog, on Soundings, two of them it is said are arrived in the river, and the OCTOBER 16, 1780  other hourly expected. Should they get in, it will be a very timely Supply for the Army. This Same Vessel brought in about five Weeks ago, A brig with 230 hhds rum.  In the Opinion of Gen.

Upon this Mr. Gibson observed to Mr Geddis that he said he had passed Mr Hopkinsons account \""because he knew Mr Hopkinson\""-And being about to take a note accordingly-Mr Matlack desired Mr Gibson not to take a note of the kind which his observation implied his intention to do- as it was uncandid and disingenious and so far so as to render it indispensibly necessary to make the observation-to prevent its being done.

As it was three weeks old I had a Right to expect another by the Post, but am disappointed. I have ever esteemd Mr Lee one of the most virtuous, active & able American Patriots. This opinion, you know, I have long entertaind of him, and therefore you justly conclude, that he meets with the most cordial Reception from me.  You was mistaken when you supposd that I had heard who were chosen into the highest Places under our new Constitution. We are OCTOBER 17, 1780  not so well informd. I had Reason to believe that Mr Hancock would be the Governor. I am disposd to think, that my Fellow Citizens had upright Views in giving him their Suffrages. Many Circumstances have combind to make this Election appear to be politically necessary; and if the People, who are now blessd with so great a Privilege, will exercise that Watchfulness over Men whom they exalt to Places of Power, which their Duty & Interest should lead them to do, I flatter myself that his will prove a happy Choice. You may wonder at my saying so; but I think I am not misguided in my Judgment in this Instance. If they have now chosen a wise & virtuous governor, a few only will be disappointed; if otherwise, Many will see their Error, and will be inducd to greater Vigilance for the future. I am far from being an Enemy to that Gentleman, tho' he has been prevaild upon to mark me as such. I have so much Friendship for him, as to wish with all my Heart, that in the most critical Circumstances, he may distinguish between his real Friends & his flattering Enemies.

How soon that business will be accomplished I am not able to ascertain, but fear it will be some time.  You may depend on my best endeavors to obtain a grant of money for the State, and I wish I could say that I expected success in the business, But when I consider the large sums due to the States of  OCTOBER 17, 1780  New York and New Jersey and the late application made by them to Congress for relief, and that they received for Answer that it was inadmisable even to give them a draught on the Loan office for a part of the four tenths in their own states, I think I am not warranted to give you any encouragement that the request will be granted in our present distressed situation.

  Dear Sir Philada. Oct. 17th. 1780 The Post having failed to arrive this week, I am deprived of the pleasure of acknowledging a line from you.  Congress have at length been brought to a final consideration of the clause relating to Indian purchases. It was debated very fully and particularly, and was in the result lost by a division of the house. Under the first impression of the chagrin I had determined to propose to my colleagues to state the whole matter to the Assembly with all the circumstances and reasoning of the opponents to the measure. (1) But on cooler reflection I think it best to leave the fact in your hands to be made use of as your prudence may suggest. I am the rather led to decline the first determination because I am pretty confident that whatever the views of particular members might be it was neither the wish nor intention of many who voted with them to favor the purchasing companies. Some thought such an assurance from Congress unnecessary because their receiving the lands from the States as vacant & unappropriated excluded all individual claims, and because they had given a general assurance that the cession should be applied to the common benefit. Others supposed that such an assurance might imply that without it Congress would have a right to dispose of the lands in any manner they pleased, and that it might give umbrage to the states claiming an exclusive jurisdiction over them. All that now remains for the Ceding States to do is to annex to their cessions the express condition that no private claims be complied with by Congress. Perhaps it would not be going too far by Virginia who is so deeply concerned to make it a condition of her grant that no such claims be admitted even within the grants of others, because when they are given up to Congress She is interested in them as much as others, and it might so happen, that the benefit of all other grants except her own might be transferred from the public, to a few land mongers. I can not help adding however that I hope this incident in Congress will not discourage any measures of the Assembly which would otherwise have been taken for ratifying the Confederation. Under the cautions I have suggested, they may still be taken with perfect security. Congress have promoted Col. Morgan to the rank of a Brigadr. on the representations in favor of it from Govrs. Rutlidge & Jefferson & Gl. Gates. The latter is directed to be made a Subject of a Ct. of Enquiry and Gl. Washington is to send a successor into the Southern department. The new arra[n]gement of the army sent to the Genl. for his revision has brought from him many judicious & valuable observations on the subject which with the arrangement are in the hands of a Committee.  The inclosed papers leave little to be added under the title of news.  OCTOBER 17, 1780  The Capture of British fleet mentioned in the letter from Eustatia is considered here as pretty certain.(2) The Saratoga has returned. She parted a few days before she got in with several of her prizes containing about 1000 Hhds. of rum & several hundred do. of sugar, which having been not since heard of we begin to fear have fallen back into the possession of the Enemy. There is a report brought to Town by Baron Stuben that an embarkation sailed from N. Y. on Thursday last but the Genl has not yet confirmed it. Docr. Lee (3) has been here several days. The inclosed letters (4) were found between the pages of Vattel.  General Scott's cause was decided on Saturday.(5) The inquisition was confirmed by the jury on the testimony of Fleetson who swore that the force was confessed to him by the General himself. Had it not been for this confession it is pretty certain the contrary evidence would have prevailed. Fortunately however after a pretty nice and tedious discussion the Inquisition was quashed by the Court, and we now stand in a secure situation.  Adieu, J. Madison Junr.

  My Dear sir Philadelphia Octr. 17th. 1780 At the time I wrote to you respecting that part of the system for the army, that had been agreed on by Congress, I had despaired of it's being submitted to your opinion. (1) I had moved for it, but my proposition was rejected, on a principle, that the whole should go together. We have received your Excys. sentiments on this very important subject, such, as I evidently foresaw would be the result of your serious consideration.(2) Your observations are incontrovertible, & unless Congress are so bigoted to the Idol they have set up, & are determined to reject every principle that can have the least tendency to invalidate the foundation on which it is erected, they must ultimately adopt the plan you propose. No other, I am convinced, can ever answer our purposes. But even in this case a most tremendous inconvenience arises-for here is the month of October better than half spent, & probably, before Congress come to a final determination, November will be arrived, & then there remains only two months for prosecuting this great work. The time is certainly too short for it's completion. I consequently dread the arrival of the first day of January. Had Congress put this business in the train, that was proposed early in Septr. so much precious time would have been saved, as, in all probability would have given success to the plan. However, we must now use our best endeavours to put things on as good a footing as the nature of the case will admit of. Yr.

9351,dg016179,1780,upon Benedict Arnold s Address,"""upon Benedict Arnold's Address
  [October 17, 1780] A correspondent observes, That, consistent with truth, the Address ought to have been in the words following:(1) To the INHABITANTS of AMERICA.  I should forfeit, even in my own opinion, the place I have so long held in your's, if I could be silent on the motives which have induced me to join the King's army. A very few words, however, shall suffice upon this subject; for to those who are acquainted with my past life this instance of my conduct needs no explanation. I am, therefore, only concerned, in this Address, to explain myself to such of my countrymen as want abilities or opportunities to detect the governing principle of my conduct in this as well as in every other part of my life.  It was my misfortune not to be born in affluent circumstances. My ruling passion is, and ever has been, vanity and a love of money. This I evinced at my first out-set in life. For having obtained credit for a quantity of drugs, which I sold to good advantage, I pretended to be bankrupt, and availing myself of the easiness and credulity of my creditor, obliged him to compound with me for half the debt. By this means I gained a considerable sum, part of which I laid out in building myself a spacious house, and with the remainder purchased a vessel and commenced trader. Those with whom I had any dealings will certify, that I never deviated from my principle of trucking and cheating whenever I had an opportunity.  When I quitted domestic happiness for the perils of the field, I conceived I had a better prospect of succeeding in my wishes. The expedition against Quebec was too flattering not to be embraced. OCTOBER 17, 1780  I anticipate your question, Was not the attempt dangerous? I answer, that with eagerness, I thought so: But I well knew the opportunity it would give me, if I succeeded, of amassing wealth by the plunder of the inhabitants; and I think I can boast with any highwayman, that I dare encounter danger for the sake of money. The citizens of Quebec, some of whom to their cost were no strangers to my character, by shutting the gate and flying to arms disappointed my sanguine expectations. The attempt to subdue them by force proved unsuccessful, and my views were thereby frustrated. However, the opportunity I afterwards had of plundering the merchants of Montreal in some small degree compensated for this disappointment. But not having fully gratified my wishes, I determined to continue in the American army, in hopes that the honours conferred upon me by my country, who were struck with the glare, and unacquainted with the motives of my conduct, and the rapid promotion I met with might throw in my way new and more favourable opportunities. The removal of the English from Philadelphia presented one, which I improved to my best advantage. You will say, was it not now time to withdraw? By no means. In contending for wealth, I am free to declare my opinion, that this end attained my warfare should cease. But I had married a young wife, set up a chariot, and entered on a plan of expensive living which swallowed up all my gains. I lamented, therefore, the prosecution commenced against me by the ruling power of Pennsylvania, who detected some of my practices, and was almost driven to despair by the scrutiny into my public accounts made by the Board of Treasury, who developed my arts of chicanery, tricking and peculation; and in one instance prevented me from securing to myself a thousand pound, hard money, notwithstanding I practiced every artifice that cunning could suggest to gain the point. Fortunately, however, a new and tempting scene opened to my view. Maj. Andre, the confidential friend of Gen. Sir Henry Clinton, gave me an opportunity of commencing a correspondence with him. My character was blasted, the people of America were beginning to treat me with soverign contempt. Even a French man, whom I had treated with so much friendship as to borrow of him twelve thousand pounds to pay for a country seat and plantation I had bought, when continental currency was worth about four for one, in silver and gold, had the assurance to hint he would be glad to take a pair of my horses for eight thousand pounds of the money lent. But this I refused, and therefore could hope for no farther favours of the like nature from him, and consequently have a right to abuse and hate him and all his countrymen. In this situation I should have changed my principles, if I had not embraced the opportunity of major Andre's correspondence. In the firm persuasion that my private interest was to be preferred to that of my country, I devoted myself to Great-Britain, thinking it infinitely wiser and  OCTOBER 18, 1780  safer to cast my confidence of making a fortune upon the bargain I should make for betraying my country, than to trust Congress, who had too much reason to despise me.  I affect no disguise, and therefore frankly declare, that in these principles I repaired to the army and solicited the command of West Point, in order to have an opportunity of surrendering it and the garrison to Great-Britain for a stipulated sum. In concerting the measures for a purpose as grateful to the British general as it would have been beneficial to me, I was only solicitous to accomplish an event of decisive importance with as much security and as little danger to myself as possible; and did not sufficiently provide for the safety of Mr. Andre. His capture has frustrated my schemes. I must therefore rely upon the clemency of my soverign and the abundant conviction that I will betray him to any who will come up to my price.  With respect to that herd of censurers, whose enmity to me originates in their hatred to the principles by which I am led to devote my life to the re-union of the British empire, as the best and only means make my fortune, they may be assured, that, conscious of the rectitude of my intentions, I shall treat their malice and calumnies with contempt and neglect. B. Arnold.  P.S. Alas for my baggage, which I left behind me!  Reprinted from the Pennsylvania Packet, or the General Advertiser, October 17, 1780.  (1) This parody was directed at an address from Benedict Arnold \""To the Inhabitants of America, \"" which was printed as a broadside by James Rivington and dated \""New York, October 7, 1780,\"" for which see Evans, Am. Bibliography no. 17,601. The two documents were printed together in the October 17 issue of the Pennsylvania Packet by John Dunlap, who introduced Arnold's work with the following explanation: \""We have just received the following Address, published in New-York by the infamous Traitor Arnold, in which he has the effrontery to avow, and attempt by flimsy arguments to justify, his perfidious Treachery.\""  That the parody was the work of Thomson may be inferred from the postscript of Ezekiel Cornell's letter to William Greene, this date, wherein Cornell explained that he was enclosing a copy of \""the Infamous Arnolds Address to which is added another prepared for the press by Mr. Secretary Thomson.\""

  Dr sir Octr. 18, 1780.(1) I wrote to you of the 1st Octr. & 10th to which I refer. The Resolution of Congress directing Genl. Washington to appoint an Officer to take the Command of the Southern Army, instead of Genl. Gates, was immediately sent to Head Quarters; but the General has not informed Congress of his proceedings thereupon, nor can I advise you who will be appointed to that Command. Genl. Gates sent us Dispatches three or four days ago, advising that Ld Cornwallis had penetrated our State as far as Charlotte, these Dispatches were immediately forwarded to the Commander in Chief, and I have some small hopes that he will be thereby induced to detach some troops to the Southward, perhaps Lee's Corps, for every Idea of acting to the Northward is now laid aside. However, I am not sanguine in this Expectation. We have Reports every day of Reinforcements going from N. York either to No. Carolina or Virginia; but nothing which can be depended on. I hope both those States will consider it as a thing certain, that Reinforcements will be sent from N. York, in the course of the ensuing Winter.  The Newspaper will inform you of the Capture of the British Et. & Wt. India fleet outward bound. A Letter to the Commercial Committe gives a more authentick accot. as thus, the British fleet consisting of 58 Sail, fell in with the combined Fleet in the Night, the Ramilies and Thetis escaped to Madeira, where the former remained eight days, and only four Merchantmen came in, the Southampton Frigate escaped and brought the first Intelligence to OCTOBER 18, 1780  St. Kitts, the Ramilies is since arrived at Jamaica, the Thetis was dispatched to give Adml. Geary Intelligence of the Combined Fleet. From these Circumstances it is conjectured that about 50 of the British Ships were captured. I hope to leave this place in three Weeks, but this depends on Remittances from Carolina-for I have long been out of cash.  I am with the greatest truth, Dr. Sir, Your most obed & Humble Servt. Willie Jones  P.S. It is said that Genl. Washington, upon Arnolds appointment to the Command at West point, gave him the Names of several Gentlemen of the first Rank in N. York, (thro' whom he obtained Intelligence of Sir Henry Clintons Motions) together with the plan of Correspondence; all which the execrable Villain Arnold disclosed on his Arrival at N.

  Saturday October 21st. 1780. Present Honble Mr McKean, Mr. Walker.  The error of the order of the 1st of June was acknowledged by Mr Gibson & Mr Forman exhibited an Amendment of the number of bills ordered to Maryland by which he conceives the order will be found incorrect only in a single instance.  Mr. Gibson-Produced Mr. Hopkinsons account to shew that the  OCTOBER 21, 1780  8 bills of 36 dollars each which is part of the charge returned by him as remaining in his hands.  Mr. Hopkinson. Observes that upon the face of the same sheet in his account those very 8 bills are expressly & clearly mentioned being \""damaged sheets\"" and \""thus not delivered,\"" and so it appears by the accounts produced by Mr Gibson.  Qu. By Mr. Hopkinson. Is it consistent with the rules of your Board to issue orders signed by a member; or is it a rule, that all orders shall be signed by the secretary?  An. By all the Commissioners. That it was the rule of the Board that the Secretary of the Board should sign the order; or the next clerk; But that orders have been frequently issued signed by an individual member.  Observation, By Mr Hopkinson, That the order of the Board not being adhered to subjected him to the Mercy of the Board in instances where the rule was not complied with which was unreasonable. That he had [....]  Colo. Palfrey.(1) Has not been able to do business with the present Gent. with that readiness he has heretofore done. That the Hotieur observed by the Gent. was rather high-That he had been at sometimes treated with great neglect-And business of great importance unnecessarily delayed-And in particular a Complaint concerning the interference of the board in his business and rights- And the drawing out monies from the Military Chest to the great hindrance and injury of his business. That he has been informed of the hours of doing business with the Treasury which is a regulation of their own-And he has been refused to do any business but  by writing.  Qu. Do you know any thing of a Private order Said to be given by the Treasury to the Treasurer not to pay any orders of Congress without their particular private order?  An. Yes, he had frequently experienced it, And in particular in an instance where he had express orders from the Treasury to hurry forward the money drawn for. And the Treasurer refused to pay it in consequence of such order as (he) Mr. H said, and he was obliged to obtain that private order. It is an Order of the Treasury, as their clerk informed him, not to do any business on the day in which the application was made.  Mr. Hillegas.(2) Has personally been decently treated-But their notes have been couched in terms \""not very clever and he has sometimes felt himself hurt by them\"".  Particular instance is a case, where money, was ordered to the Eastward where offers were made by the Board to assist in the business several days after it was done, and on a Message by them being received and full information given to him, he has been rather hurt by the manner of the ans and of an answer in writing. He has (been  severely reprirnanded:) had a very severe rap for having disobeyed in some small instances of evident distress and necessity to persons going away, the order for not paying any orders of Congress without their private order, and in paying, particularly, the doorkeeper of Congress about 100 Dollars.  Instances a case of a person producing an order for payment which on his readily offering to pay it, the holder of the draft expressed his surprize at it-by saying he had expected to have received the same kind of treatment in the Treasury office, which he had received in some other offices; but that he was determined to make the trial and intended, if he had met with like treatment as in the other offices, to have thrown the order in the fire-declaring that he had much rather have lost the whole Money than to dance such attendance and bear such treatment. He has received from Mr Lee verbal orders, express orders, to make return of the state of Payment of all drafts &c, which it has been hinted was not by order of the Board.  That the order respecting the shutting of their doors was occasioned by an [. . .] of their in leaving on their bills an order for purchasing gold &c [. . .] which Chaloner (3) had had &c and mentioned to them. Has certainly not been that confidential intercourse between the offices as had been heretofore.  Some letters from the secy.(4) in a very angry stile and without the usual stile of politeness-informing him that his attendance for explaining some difficulties in his order was unnecessary.  Mr. Millegan.(5) He cannot say he has ever received much politeness from any of them nor any personall insult or affront (except once).  The orders which have been issued have sometimes been inconsistent and contradictory-but that he did not chuse to contend with them on matters of duty they being his superiors. He has been frequently refused personal communications on business which required it and might have been dispatched in a few minutes. In cases where their advice was necessary as he judged. Has lately had more access to them. It is certain that confidential intercourse between the officers has been greatly lessened and interrupted.  Accots. of Mr Hopkinson which has been before them five or six weeks, and passed upon only a few days ago.  He has seen Mr. Hopkinsons Account interlined, by another hand; but it did not appear to be with a fraudulent design.  Has the appointment of [. . . ] Clerks.  Mr Flowers (6) account lies before the Auditors among many others under dift. circumstances-refers to orders delivered-And it is explained that Mr. Flowers accounts mentioned by Mr Nicholson was not referred to the Chamber of Accounts according to the New Arrangements.  Colo. Palfry was introduced.  qu. by Mr. McKean. Has the business of your department with  the Treasury been lately conducted with the same harmony and attention as heretofore; or have you observed any Particular hotour in the commissioners of the Treasury?  An. To the first Part. I do not think it was.  qu. by Mr Gibson. In what particular instance?  An. Formerly I had free access whenever My business required it; latter I have not had, that access which I thought my business required.  qu. By McKean-Did you observe any thing in the behaviour of the Com. of Tr. haughty or improper?  An. When I have been Present with them, they have treated me like a Gentleman; but I have been often obliged to wait; whether they know who was attending or not I do not know. But I most certainly have found it much more difficult to do business with the new board, than with the former one.  qu. You observed that there was a hotour in the behavior of the Coms. What was your Precise Idea in that case?  An. I conceived the new board took much more state upon them than the former board-That is my idea.  qu. Do you know anything of a Private order said to be issued by the Comissioners to the Treasury Not to pay money without their Private order?  An. Yes frequently-Particularly in an instance of very great importance an order was given Me by the Treasury and requested him to exert himself to obtain it immediately, that upon going to the Treasury Mr Hillegas refused payment because he had not received the Private orders of the Treasury for the payment of it. That he immediately returned to the Treasury to obtain the order; but he found nobody in the office. He afterward saw Mr Lee, who said the order should be sent.  qu. Mr. McKean. Did you understand it to be an order of the Treasury board not to do business on the day of the application being made?  An. Yes I have understood it to be so, and have found it so in some important instances.  Qu. Do you know if this is extended to all cases  An. I cant say how far it extends-but it has to all cases of my business.  Qu. Do you know of any Particular injury which the Public have sustained by this rule in your department?  An. I cannot say I do; but I have found it to be very inconvenient.  Qu. by Mr Hopkinson; You say the board did business only in Writing. Have you had any correspondance with the Board?  An. Yes.  Qu: Have you conceived, that any thing contained in their letters to you was hateur or improper?  An: In some instances I have thought the expressions contained in them, was not in terms such I as thought might have been used to one holding the rank in office which I have the honour to do.  Mr. Gibson requested the letters might be referred to And Colo. Palfrey went for them.  In the mean time Mr. Hillegas was interrogated-by Mr. McKean. [qu.] Do you know anything of a Mr. Hopkinsons having designd devices for the flag, Seals, borders of bills &c for the Continent; And were you concerned in devising any of them.  An: I recollect, that a Piece of Paper was put into my hands by one of the Gent.(7) (I think from the Jersey) containing a request to think of some device for a Treasury seal, that he had suggested & sketched out from rough design containing a seale & a seal; but not in the manner the Device was adopted. I dont understand heraldry; and it was corrected & amended by Mr. Hopkinson-But as to any of the other seals, I don't know that I was ever consulted upon them. I understood them to be designed by Mr. Hopkinson.  qu By Mr. Gibson. Did not I consult you privately on the subject of a seal for the Treasury?  An: I have some faint recollection that you did.  qu By Mr. McKean. Did Mr. Hopkinson receive any Private assistance from you in these designs?  An: No.  qu By Mr. Gibson. Did not the Treasury board, both the former and the present, send for you frequently to consult with you concerning the implements for striking the money as well as the Certificates?  An: Yes scores of times.  qu Did you ever charge for any of these works of fancy?  An. No-I have not yet: I leave that to my Masters.  qu. Did you ever do any labours of fancy for the public?  An. I have assisted in almost every of the emissions, and bestowed a great deal of time in that way; but I never invented a device & I have assisted in forming the backs-And proposed the horses to be affixed to a different Denomination from that intended by Dr. Franklin, for a reason which made him laugh.  Ob. by Mr Gibson: You enjoy a salary under Congress.  An. Yes sir!  [qu.] You say you never sketched a device, Did you ever draw an ornament?  An. I never kept an account of those things.  qu. by Mr Hopkinson. Did you assist in forming the designs for the bills now in the Press?  An. No.  Observation by Mr Hopkinson-The design was formed by me at Mr Duffields-where I spent several days.   Coll. Palfry returned and introduced an observation, That the Treasury had requested him to make an estimate of the Pay of the Army-Which he had inforned them was absolutely out of his Power-That upon his application for money-he reced their letter of the 31 May (which should have been 13th May) and of the 13 May-both which were recd on the same day.  Observes, That the means of forming an estimate of the pay was not in his Power-it was refused him by the board of war-and estimates could not possibly be made.  Mr. Gibson you observed that business was not conducted with that harmony that there was formerly.  An. Within this month it has been otherwise; but some time before, that attention was not Paid to my applications in writing which I thought their importance required.  qu. Did you not suppose there might be cases which required partia[lity] ?  An. I have thought there was, in my department the very existence of the Army might depend on their pay being advanced. No pay has [....]  qu. By Mr Forman. You say, that you have found more difficulty in doing business with the present board than with the former one. Did not this difficulty arise from the state of the Treasury?  An. In part it might; but it was in my opinion chiefly owing to the new rules & regulations.  qu. by do. Have you any other reason for thinking the present board take more state than the former one than the fixing office hours?  An. I have been kept waiting I thought unreasonably when my business required explanations.  qu. Have you been kept waiting when you attended in the hours appointed?  [An.] I do not recollect-except in an instance where perhaps it was owing to you forgetting I was below.  qu. Was the manner of doing business with the present board different from that of the former one?  An. I did not meet with any way near the same readiness and expeditious[ness] as formerly.  Mr Milligan-examined.  qu. Have you been treated with politeness by the Com. of Trea. Or with rudeness?  An. I have not received much of either from them-nor (any particular) rudeness except once when Mr Burke was Present-\""who was the harshest man I ever met with. \""  qu. Have you always found the Orders clear and intelligent?  An. In general so. I have thought they were in a harsh tone. I endeavoured to execute them-they had a right direct.  Qu. Has Coll. Flowers account mentioned if Mr Nicholsons letter  been referred to the Chamber of Accounts by the Commissioners? An. No they lie in the Chambers; but they have not had the formal reference which the regulations require-they have lain there perhaps near 12 mos.  Qu. by Mr. Gibson. You speak of harsh ordurs being given.  An. I said \""in a harsh tone.\""  Qu. Were they more so than formerly used to the Auditors?  An. I thought so-Perhaps it might only be with design to introduce method.  Mr. Gibson then read a former order of the board. Mr. Milligan-observed, That the orders thro him to the Chambers were what was very dissagreable to me and you know, Mr Gibson, I often complained of it.  qu. Was not these orders consistent with the rules of the board (in 30 July 1779 Ordnance).(8)  An. I suppose they were-but I thought them unnecessarily harsh-and \""it is particularly disagreable to be placed between the Treasury and the Chambers as between two fires\"".  Qu. by Gib. Was you ever treated by the board, as a board,with undue pride or insolence of office?  An: No-the time I complain of there was only Mr Burke and you present.  Mr. Nourse, (9) examined (assistant Auditor General and formerly under Mr. Gibson)  Qu. Did you ever observe any undue Pride or insolence of office?  An. When the A. Genl. has been absent I have done the business and have been politely treated-have receivd personal Civilities. It is difficult for one insubordinate office to judge of hoteur in office.  qu. Have you ever received any inconsistent orders or such as was impossible to be executed?  An. When Mr Milligan was absent in July last I was directed to convey several orders to the Coms. of Chambers of Accots. which put me in a disagreable situation by being the conveyance of those orders; but as to their being incorrect-I recollect none.  Ou. By Mr Gibson. Did you ever know of the board having treated any person with undue pride or insolence?  An. I dont recollect any particular instance.  Qu. Mr McKean. Have you heard any Person complain of it?  An. I have heard Persons frequently complain-they could not obtain audience during the hours of office.  qu. By Mr. Forman. Do you think those complaints arose from the hours of office being fixed?  An: In a great measure they did-together with the state of the Treasury.  Mr. Pat. Farrell.(10) Qu. Have you observed any undue Pride or insolence of office OCTOBER 22, 1780  in the Com. of the Treasury to any Persons?  An. I have not.  Obs. by Mr Forman-This Gent. is constantly in the office- respecting Order for 20 Bills of 444 when he had but 16 of the denom[ination] in his possession.  Exhibits a return of Mr. Hopkinson containing 66 bills of 444 remaining in his hands dated June 17. 1780. Whereas there was in truth only 16 for there had been an Order of 5th May for 50 bills of that denomination which he had not charged.  Respecting the order to deliver Bills to the Board of war. The Board had a right to order the Bills to whom they judged proper-but the order was a clerical mistake and corrected accordingly, on application, altho the order ought to have been complied with and had it been complied with the accounts would have stood properly altho it was more advantageously expeditious to stand as it now does.(11)  ""

  Sir, Philada. Octor. 22d. 1780. Reports very likely have reached you of our Obtaining an important Advantage over the Enemy in Carolina. The particulars are contained in several letters the copies of which I enclose. (1) The whole intelligence depends upon the Veracity of Major Tate, which, as he was well known to Genls. Davidson & Sumner and the Action at no great distance from them, and they give it as authentick, it Obtains full Credit here; no mention is made of the Enemys baggage, which if their Capture is true no dobt fell into our hands. The OCTOBER 22, 1780  Numbers killed & taken falls considerable short of the Number they are Stated at, and yet, the Numr. of Arms said to be taken exceeds their Numr. of Troops-in the first [ . . . ] part might have escaped and in the latter they might be carrying spare Arms with them. These matters must be left to be cleared up when we Obtain more particulars relative to the affair. The killed, prisoners, and Numr. of Arms I suppose Major Tate gives by conjecture only, and not from any Actual Acct. taken, which when ascertained may differ considerably. The copies I did not take with a view to sending from me or they would not have appeared quite so rough.  With this good News, we also recd. this day disagreable intelligence from the Northward.(2) Butler & Brandt with a Number of British & Tories had made an incursion from Canada, Landed at the head of South bay, taken Fort Ann and Fort George with their small Garrisons: The same or another party from the Westward had invested Fort Schuyler but had not ventured upon an Attack-some Continentals with the Militia were on their March to relieve the Fort. The Enemy had burn'd many houses, barracks of grain & hay &c in their rout. This expedition Governor Clinton thinks was intended as a Cooperation with the British up the North River in Case Arnolds Treachery had succeeded, which being defeated he thinks they will make but a short stay.  Two of the Saratogas Prizes it is said have arrived safe in the River and are coming up. Of the other no Certain intelligence hath been recd. tho' some think she is got into Sinepuxant, as such a like Vessel was lately seen, as Supposed standing in there.  Congress lately agreed upon a Reduction of the Continental Regiments granting to all Reduced Officers one Years pay-since which they have engaged half pay for life to all such. The Natural Consequence you may be sure was to grant the half pay for life to all that continued in the service. This Proceeding extraordinary as it is met with no Opposition but from the four New England States & New Jersey, the Opposition from one of the Eastern States was but feeble.3 It gives me inexpressible pain to see Congress Sporting away the publick money and increasing our debt at the very time we are in a Perfect State of bankruptcy. Were our Finances in ever so good a state, the Measure is inconsistant with our ideas of liberty and Maxims of Government to pension for life such a Number Among us; it is also unjust with regard to those who were not long since dismissed on one Years depreciated pay without the depreciation made up to them for the time of their service, and many others through Necessity, want of employ, or ill treatment have lately left the Army without any future allowance or depreciation of money for past Services granted to them. Congress appears to be tumbling down fast and will I believe soone retain no more than a Name and that I fear not a good one. Some late appointments in the Medical   Line will not I believe add much to their decayed Reputation. But I shall say no more on this disagreeable Subject, Assuring Your Excellency I am, with due respects, Your Obedt. & Humble Servt. Abra. Clark  ""

Every Possible argument against the Measure was Adduced by its Opponents but to no Purpose. It might be Imprudent in me to Name the Yeas and Nays as taken on the Question. The Journal of That Transaction (3) will forever Remain a Standing Testimonial of the true Spirit of Republican Liberty in some States whilst others are fond of Measures leading Directly to aristocracy.  I hope the Several States who mean to Preserve their Rights, and our State in Particular will in good Time Provide Laws to Render Gentlemen in Pay of the united States Incapable of a Seat in the Legislative Body or of holding a Civil Office under a State, it is a Rule that no Man in Pay of the united States shall hold a Seat in Congress.

9368,dg016196,1780,Treasury Inquiry Committee Minutes,"""Treasury Inquiry Committee Minutes
  Monday October 23rd 1780. Present Mr. McKean, Mr. Walker & Mr. Matlack  Mr. Geddis. I have not received any personal affront from the Commissioners of the Treasury or either of them; but having an accot. in hand which required explanation and went to the board knocked at the door. Mr. Lee came out asked why he came there at that time-said that he ought to have known better than to have come there at that hour-to which Geddis replied that he thought he had a right to come there at any time to receive information on the business committed to him.  Mr. Lee, pointing to the regulations fixed up, bid him, in a haughty tone and manner, to look there-upon which he (Geddis) replied that it was the first time he had heard of such a rule-to which Lee replied-that he ought to have known it.  We have received many orders not to be understood some of which have been, heretofore, laid before Congress and reported upon by a Committee and some of the more important complaints redressed- these we suppose not now the subject of enquiry.  The order (rather letter) of the Treasury of 16 May 1780 (1) was read, containing cause of complaint.  do. of 12 May-with remark endorsed.(2)  Letter of Geddis & Mercier 24th Feby. 1780  [Letter] of the same....l3th May. OCTOBER 23, 1780  Mr. Gibson having entered a Note expressly saying that Mr McKean had given his Opinion on the order of the Treasury of the 16th of May 1780. This being under the eye of TM-he observed, that the entry Mr. Gibson made was not true that Mr. McKean had expressly replied to your observation of the impropriety of his observation before he had heard your defence-to which he replied he had a right to make his remarks when he pleased, that he thought it proper now to make them and that it was indecent in Mr Gibson to interpose to prevent. The facts are thus.  TM (3) remarked that the second sentence of the resolve of 16 May 1780 would have disgraced the most arbitrary prince in the world-to this Mr Gibson replied, You have not yet heard the reason of this rule on the letter on which it was founded-To which, Mr. M. replied, that he had made the remark upon the naked sentiment expressed in the resolution in order that the Commissioners might advert to the necessity of explaining a sentiment which appeared so extraordinary. Mr. McKean took up the resolution, in Order and was making his remarks on other parts of it, when the above altercation took place.  Present, when the above mentioned Order Passed, Gibson, Burke & Henry.  qu. In whose hand writing is that letter?  An. By Mr Gibson. Mr. Clarkson.(4)  qu. In whose hand was the original?  An. I believe in Mr. Lee's.  qu. Do the Treasury permit letters of so important a nature to be written and sent by their clerk without the examination of the board?  An. The letters are produced to the board and approved the orginal of this letter was, I believe, written by Mr Burke. It is the Boards letter.  The letter which occasioned the order of 16 May, was a letter written by Mr. Mercer & Mr. Govett to Doctor Foster, director General of the hospital of the Eastern department.  qu. By Mr. Mercier. Was any steps taken, after that order, (16 May), by the Board of Treasury, to call Dr. Foster to account for a very large ballance due from him?  Obs. by Mr. Mercier. The Chamber of accounts being, in the above manner, prevented from corresponding with him.  An. It is not the business of that Gentleman to call us to an account. That Matter will appear in the course of the examination.  Mr. Geddis-presents a report of the Chamber of accounts of the 7th Decr. 1779 in the Case of D S Franks Upon which the Commissioners of Treasury Order the Chamber of Accounts to allow a voucher which the Chamber thought insufficient. The Commissioners knew that Genl. Arnold had, as he informed them, sent for Franks to give testimony on his trial.(5)   Mr. Mercier.  Qu. Have you any complaints against the Commissioners of the Treasury? No not merely as a board-but against Mr Gibson-as a private gentleman appealing against our report-his expressions I will repeat as nearly as I can recollect. He accuses us of \""a mere parade of care for the public interest to the injury of private property. \""  Mr Govett.  Qu. the same Question?  An. Not otherwise than the complaint of Mr Mercier. I have had no opportunity of receiving any insult since the order for corresponding in writing only. The complaint of the order of the Commissioners of the Treasury to the Auditor to direct and order the Chamber of accounts appears to Me to be well founded & the order unwarrantable.  Mr. Geddis. That order hurt our pride.  Mr Gibson. Yes! Your Pride was hurt. That's it!  Qu. by Mr. Gibson. Did a conversation pass between Mr. Geddis and me about the latter end of May upon the subject of the orders of Treasury?  An. There was.  Qu. Did not you let me know That the reason the Gent. of the Chambers did not speak to me was that I had promoted the measure of setting office hours for the Chamber of accounts and setting on foot an inquiry into their Conduct?  An. No such conversation did pass-for the Chamber of accotts. did all of them speak to you at that time. A conversation did pass between but it is perverted it seems. I can relate the conversation if desired.  Qu. What was the conversation-(by the Committee)?  An. An order was sent down to the Chamber of accotts. (dated 12 May-enquiring into the hours of doing business in the Chambers &c). The Chambers were surprised at this order as the Commissioners passed the chambers every day and we suspected they were claiming a right which we could not submit to-they knew when we sat and we expected the matter would blow over-but another order came soon after, between the 23 & 12th, which convinced us that the Treas. intended to assume an authority to which we thought we ought not to comply with. I went to Mr. Burke and asked him if the Treasury were in ear[nest] in this matter. He said they were. I told him as a private Gent. that then, for myself, I was determined not to obey that order.(6)  Observ. The first order was 4th May. To which an Answer was given by Mr Milligan informing, That the Chambers & Auditor attended from 8 to 1 and from 3 to six-And the order was reitterated on the 12th.  Representation of the Auditors for more room-24 May 1780.  Reitterated order of the Treasury of 25th May 1780.  Upon this a representation was made to Congress and a hearing had. Whereupon the resolve of Congress of June 24th passed.  Mr Geddis. I asked Mr Gibson why these orders were made- he said he thought the order was proper; I told him the Chambers could not as Gentlemen submit to it. That if those orders were withdrawn, harmony and good understanding might be restored. Mr Gibson replied the Board was determined to try what powers they had. Mr Gibson rose in Committee & desired Mr Geddis to recollect himself to which Mr. Geddis replied upon my honor it is true. Mr Gibson was called to order & reminded that all the altercations which had happened had arisen from this kind of irregularity, that the Committee were determined during the remainder of the hearing to be exact in the formality which was found absolutely necessary to prevent very disagreable altercations. Mr Gibson-Asked pardon & promised to be more circumspect.  Mr. Geddis-proceeded. That he informed Mr. Gibson it was understood that he was the author of these regulations. That Mr. Burke had upon a conversation with him said that the Board only wanted the Answer of the Chambers to determine what to do- that they would form the Chambers. That the manner of their receiving information of Mr Gibsons being at the bottom of those measures, was by information from Mr. Troope.(7)  Qu. by Mr. Gibson. \""Did not Mr Burke avow the measures then going into & promoted them\""?  An. He did. But I beg leave to observe that the information was given by Mr Troope before Mr. Burke was a member of the Treasury And he had information by Mr Henry that a Question whether one of the board should not sit with the Chambers-And it was also further informed, that proposals were made in the Treasury board to task the Chambers of accounts and mention was made in confidence who was the member that proposed it. Mr Gibson desired Mr Geddis to tell all and turning to the Committee desired that they would take notice of what he said upon which Mr. Matlack desired Mr Gibson to forbear his directions to the Committee and confine himself within the bounds of his duty. That he would be permitted to ask such questions as he thought necessary for elucidating the Matter; but that the Committee could not, after what had passed permit any farther such irregularity and that if he persisted in them the reiterated reperchussions must and would necessarily follow.  Qu. By Mr. Gibson. Did you give to me your idea of the powers of the three branches of the Treasury?  An. I do not recollect. The scope of my intention, on that occasion, was to heal the divisions which had arisen between the Treasury and the Chambers.  Qu. By Mr. Forman-to Mr. Govett. Was the Commissioners  of the Chambers ever refused a conference with the Com of Treasury at any other hours than those appointed for private business?  An. I always understood, That everything was to be done in writing-And that there very seldom was a board at any other hours -there was perhaps a single member just to receive applications. I was never in the Treasury Chambers but once I believe after the order for doing business in writing.  Qu. by do. Do you know of any business that has suffered for want of attendance at other hours?  An. We cannot answer a question of this kind. We are not competent to it. We are not acquainted with the business. One delay in Hollingsworths account rendered it necessary to revise that account and report a new-which took up some time.  Qu. by do. Were the Commissioners of Accounts ever informed that the board of Treasury would do no business with them but in writing? An. Mr. Milligan informed us, that this was the determination of the board-And assigned it as a reason why he could not receive any verbal answer to the demand made respecting the hours of office-the most trivial business was done in writing.  Qu. Did either of the commissioners inform you, that there was such an order?  An. No. But all orders came thro the Auditor from whom we received that order verbally-And Mr Geddis once attempted to do business verbally, as above mentioned, and was refused and the reason assigned as before related.  Mr. Gibson.  Mr. Govett Observes. That there was no coolness between the chambers until their report on Mr. Gibson's account, which occasioned the whole of it-And was the sole foundation for the charge, laid by Mr. Gibson of parade &c which charge very much hurt the Chamber.  Mr. Nicholson. What do you know of the conversation wch. passed with Mr Smith, or any other of the Chambers, in Consequence of what Mr Troop when secretary of the board had informed them concerning hours of office &c?  An. I did not hear Mr Troop give the information concerning the hours of office; but from the Commissioners conversation with each other I learned that he had informed them, that Mr Gibson had proposed such a thing to the board at which they were very much iritated-they spoke of it more than once or twice and Mr Smith in particular observed in a menacing stile that Mr Gibson had better be cautious in his proceedings: otherwise Mr Smith might, if he continued such conduct, find means to have him removed from the Treasury-this was previous to the report on the account of Mr Gibson.  Qu. When did Mr Troop go away?  An. In February-And the Accot. of Mr. Gibson was presented about the 6th March-(which day was agreed to by Mr Gibson).  Observed, by Mr. Mercier. That Mr Troop was here in April.  Adjourned till Wednesday 11 o'clock.(8) ""

  My dear Sir [October 24, 1780] (1) I have not yet laid aside your Letter of the 17th of September,(2) which is the last I have receivd from you. It ill becomes you, my Friend, to think of retiring into private Life, who can lay your hand on your heart and say, that in your publick Conduct you have in no Instance deviated from virtuous Principles. If ever the Time shall come, when vain and aspiring Men shall possess the highest Seats of Government, our Country will stand in Need of its experiencd Patriots, to prevent its Ruin. There may be more Danger of this, than some, even of our well disposd Citizens may imagine. If the People should grant their Suffrages to Men, only because they conceive them to have been Friends to the Country, without Regard to the necessary Qualifications for the Places they are to fill, the Administration of Government will become a mere Farce, and our  OCTOBER 24, 1780  publick Affairs will never be put on a Footing of solid Security. We should mark the Tempers as well as the Abilities of Men, if we would form a Judgment in what Manner the Trusts to be reposd in them will probably be executed. You know the Character of Pisistratus.3 He was a Citizen of Athens, supposd to have many excellent Qualities; but he had an insatiable Lust of Preeminence. Solon would discover his Vanity, but the People were blinded by a false Glare of Virtues, and he was their Idol. Under Pretence of his having escaped imminent Danger from a violent Faction, and the further Insecurity of his Person, he artfully obtaind a Guard of Soldiers, by which Means he possessd himself of the Citadel and usurpd the Government. But though he made himself Sovereign, and thus far overthrew the popular Election, the Historian tells us, that he made no Change in the Magistracy or the Laws. He was content that others should hold their Places according to the Rules of the Constitution, so that he might continue himself Archon, independent of the Suffrages of the People. This he effected; for though several Attempts were made to deprive him of the Sovereignty which he had with equal Art & Violence obtaind, he held it till his Death and left it to his Children. Such was the Ambition of a Man, who indeed assumd Authority, and such were the Effects of it. Power is intoxicating, and Men who have been legally vested with it, have too often discoverd the same dangerous Disposition. How different a Man was Pisistratus from the Roman Hero and Patriot Lucius Quinctius Cincinatus, who, though vested with the Authority of Dictator, was so moderate in his Desires of a Continuance of Power, that having in six Weeks fulfilld the Purpose of his Appointment, he resignd the dangerous office which he might have held till the Expiration of Six Months. When we formerly had weak & corrupt Governors, it was our Misfortune; but for the future, while we enjoy and exercise the inestimable Right of chusing them our selves, it will be our Disgrace. I hope our Countrymen will always keep a watchful Eye over the publick Conduct of those whom they exalt to Power, making at the same Time, every just Allowance for the Imperfections of human Nature. And I pray God, we may never see Men, filling the sacred Seats of Government, who are wanting in adequate Abilities, or influencd by any Motives or Feelings seperate from the publick Wellfare.  ""

You will no doubt have received intelligence before this reaches you of the sailing of the British fleet from New York with a body of 2500 infantry on board and some few horse, under the command of Genl.

Their destination is not yet certainly known, but Virginia, or North Carolina we are pretty well assured must be their object.  It is highly probable a general exchange of prisoners will soon take place, (2) which we apprehend must have some effect on our affairs to the southward, as it is most likely the prisoners received on the part of the enemy will be employed to the southward. Those we receive will be likewise employed there, but our numbers must be far inferior to theirs on account of the expiration of the time of many of our men now in captivity, which cannot be the case with those of the enemy.

I do my self the honor to inclose to your Excellency the proceedings of a Board of General Officers on the case of Major Andre, a Veiw of the title of a tract of Country called Indianna (1) and a resolution that passed in Congress on Saturday last-Together with this days paper.  The Indiana affair is a matter of great consequence, the state of Virginia hath undertaken to vacate the title made to the grantees and take the land to themselves, which proceedings gives much uneasiness to the original propriators as its a Country of emence value and they have mad application to Congress for relief who in my opinion have little to do in the affair, but both parties have their advocates (2)  I shall make no Comment on the resolution of Congress as my sentiments will appear by the yeas and nays (3) at the same time I wish nothing therein contained may in the least opperate to the retarding of the recruting service. You will also see the Regts. are agmented, which was occasioned by Genl. Washingtons informing Congress that he had been obliged in his late Conference with the French Gentlemen at Hartford to fix on a number of men for the'next Campaign equal to what is now called for and that Estimate was sent to France.  You will see by the inclosed News paper some good News from the Southard which is beleived at this place, (4) the bells hath rung on the occasion, and many expect Cornwallis will be Burgoyned, I hope he may.  General Greene is appointed by the Commander in Chief to the Command of the Southern Army and is expected in this City on his way to take upon him his command every hour.  General Gates who but a little time since stood high on the list of Fame stands at this time very low, and in addition to his other Misfortunes hath lately buryed his Son.  By offical accounts received Yesterday from Governor Clinton of N York the Enemy were advanced from Canada to the frontiers of the state of N York in two large bodies Consisting of Regular Troops, Torys & Indians one by the way of the South bay the other by Niagara and have taken several Forts.(5) The affair of Vermont hath slept for some time and nothing is determd. I believe when it was last debated the gentlemen from New York did not like very well the sentiments of a Majority of the members on the subject and will lett the affair rest untill a change in members shall take place that will better suit their purpose.  On Thursday last a letter from Auther Lee was Read in Congress OCTOBER 24, 1780  the Subject matter was taken up and all the old members appeared perfectly acquainted therewith tho, not fully agreed.(6) I must Confess I am not able as yet to find the right side of the Question if there is one but I am sure there is a high Quarrel which at present I wish to have no hand in but it appears a winters work is cuting out. I hope it will not opperate to the procrastination of business of grater moment. I shall do my self the honour to inclose your Excellency a Coppy of Mr. Lees letter in my next.  The News of the Spaniards Cap[ture of 1 the English outward bound East & W India Fleet [is] this moment confirmed by a Letter from Mr. [. . .] at Lisbon who saith Five East Indiamen had arrived at that place and brought Intelgence that the Fleet had almost all struck their Coulors before they left the Fleet.  I cannot help mentioning (tho, with reluctance) that I am often duned for money by the stone cutter, a bill of which I sent by Mr. Ellery. As It was a debt that came on me unavoidablely I cannot doubt the willingness of the state to enable me to pay the debt and thereby extricate my self from a situation that is disagrable.  I have the honour to be with every sentiment of esteem and respect, your Excellencys most obedient, Humble Servant,  Ezek.

  Dear Sir Philada. Octr. [24,] 1780 (1) Your favor of the 9th which ought to have come on Monday last did not arrive till Thursday. That of the 17th came yesterday according to the expectation.(2)  I wish it was in my power to enable you to satisfy the uneasiness of people with respect to the disappointment in foreign succour.(3) I am sensible of the advantage which our secret enemies take of it. I am persuaded also that those who ought to be acquainted with the cause [of] it are sensible of it; and as they give no intimations on the subject it is to be inferred they are unable to give any that would prevent the mischief. It is so delicate a subject, that with so little probability of succeeding, it would perhaps be hardly prudent to suggest it. As soon as any solution comes out you shall be furnished with it.  I have informed Pleasants that you would write to him from Richmond, and on application to Pemberton was promised a written sketch of his terms which I have not yet received. If it comes before this is sealed I shall enclose it.(4)  We continue to receive periodical alarms from the Commissary's & Quarter Master's departments. The season is now arrived when provision ought to be made for a season that will not admit of transportation, and when the monthly supplies must be subject to infinite disappointments even if the States were to do their duty. But instead of Magazines being laid in our army is living from hand to mouth, with a prospect of being soon in a condition still worse. How a total dissolution of it can be prevented in the course of the winter is for any resources now in prospect utterly inexplicable, unless the States unanimously make a vigorous & speedy effort to form  OCTOBER 24, 1780  Magazines for the purpose. But unless the States take other methods to procure their specific supplies than have prevailed in most of them, their utmost efforts to comply with the requisitions of Congress can be only a temporary relief. This expedient as I take it was meant to prevent the emission of money. Our own experience as well as the example of other Countries made it evident that we could not by taxes draw back to the treasury the emissions as fast as they were necessarily drawn out. We could not follow the example of other Countries by borrowing, neither our own Citizens nor foreigners being willing to lend as far as our wants extended. To continue to emit ad infinitum was thought more dangerous than an absolute occlusion of the press. Under these circumstances the expedient of specific requisitions was adopted for suppling the necessities of the war. But it is clear the success of this expedient depends on the mode of carrying it into execution. If instead of executing it by specific taxes, State emissions, Commissary's & Q. master's certificates which are a worse species of emissions, are recurred to, what was intended for our relief will only hasten our destruction.  As you are at present a legislator (5) I will take the liberty of hinting to you an idea that has occurred on this subject. I take it for granted that taxation alone is inadequate to our situation. You know as well as I do how far we ought to rely on loans to supply the defect of it. Specific taxes as far as they go are a valuable fund but from local and other difficulties will never be universally and sufficiently adopted Purchases with State money or certificates will be substituted. In order to prevent this evil and to insure the supplies, therefore I would propose, that they be diffused and proportioned among the people as accurately as circumstances will admit, that they be impressed with vigor & impartiality, and paid for in certificates not transferrible to be redeemable at some period subsequent to the war at specie value and bearing an intermediate interest. The advantage of such a scheme is this, that it would anticipate during the war the future revenues of peace, as our Enemies and all other modern nations do. It would be compelling the people to lend the public their commodities, as people elsewhere lend their money to purchase commodities. It would be a permanent resourse by which the war might be supported as long as the earth should yield its increase. This plan differs from specific taxes only in this that as an equivalent is given for what is received much less nicety would be requisite in apportioning the supplies among the people, and they might be taken in places where they are most wanted. It differs from the plan of paying for supplies in state emissions or common certificates in this, that the latter produce all the evils of a redundant medium, whereas the former not being transferrible can not have that effect, and moreover do not require the same degree of taxes during the war.  We were informed a few days ago by Genl Washington that the  fleet with about two thousand troops on board had fallen down [the river] towards the Hook, but as nothing further has since come fro[m him] on that subject, I conclude they still remain there. The Cork [fleet,] it is said has at last arrived, amounting to upwards of 1[00 Sail.] No further account his been received here of the capture [of] the English Jamaica fleet. There has been a report today that the Prizes of the Saratoga mentioned in my last are in the river.  Letters from Governor Clinton mention that two parties from Canada consisting of near 1000 each had appeared on their frontier; The one by the way of Ticonderoga & lake George, the other by the way of the Oneida lake. They have already done some mischief and threaten to do a great deal more.

  Dear Sir Philada. Octr. [24,](1) 1780  Your favor of the 8th which ought to have been here on Monday week did not arrive till Thursday; that of the 17th came yesterday (2) according to expectation. I know not how to account for your disappointment on the last post day having not omitted to write once since the institution of our correspondence.  Although the stroke of good fortune you mention does not appear to have been truly represented, it was only mistaken for one of equal importance which I doubt not is fully known to you by this time.(3) Our joy on this event has been somewhat abated by intelligence of an opposite complexion from the State of N. York. Two parties from Canada composed of regulars, tories, Canadians and Savages and amounting to about 1000 each have entered their frontiers, the one by the way of lake George, the other by the way of the Oneida lake. They have already done some mischief, and as they are pursuing their incendiary plan, will involve the inhabitants in very great distress, (it being now the eve of winter) unless a speedy check can be given to their progress. It is supposed that this expedition was intended to take advantage of the consternation in that state expected to result from the success of Arnolds treason.  We had information some days ago from Genl Washington that a fleet with about 2000 troops on Board had fallen down towards the Hook, which it was supposed was destined either for Virginia or N. Carolina. As nothing further has come from the General it is to be inferred that they have not yet sailed. It is said the Cork fleet consisting of upwards of 100 Sail has at last safely arrived. The capture of the British fleet from Jamaica rests on the same evidence as mentioned in my last. I am Dr Sr Affec yr. obt. Servt.  J. Madison Junr.  PS. The President has just communicated a letter from Mr. Harrison at Cadiz confirming the capture of the B. fleet. Some of the Priz[es were] in that bay when he wrote. The number taken was unknown. The fleet amounted to 60 or 70 Sail, having on board Military Stores, provisions, dry goods & 1000 Highland troops for the East Indies. You will have the particulars by the next post. 5 or 6 Ships also attempting to get into Gibralter with provisions have been taken by the Spanish Squadron Stationed off that place. 30 Sail of French Merchantmen had arrived safe from St Domingo.

  Dear Sir Philadelphia Octr 24th 80 The defeat of Ferguson gives a flattering prospect to our southern department.  Soon after my arrival at this place I wrote you largely. (1) I presume that before this reaches you, you will hear that Congress has directed  OCTOBER 24, 1780  the commander in Chief to cause a Court of inquiry into the causes of the failure of the late expedition in South Carolina and to appoint an Officer to take command in that department during your suspension; and in consequence thereof Genl. Greene is appointed to that command who is supposed to be on his way from headquarters before this time.  This measure is at least ostinsibly founded on a standing resolution of Congress respecting the Loss of Posts, defeat of Armies &c. I doubt not you will view this as an addition to your late misfortunes-many others with myself feel very sensibly for you.  On my way hence as will as in this City I found the current of censure strong against you. I have opposed & contradicted many romantic tales and surmises.  I am conscious that I have treated you with candor in my representations and asscribed your misfortunes to their true causes.  The state of our finances, the want of vigor in the several States gives Congress infinite embarrassments.  At the instance of the Empress of Russia a Congress is to be held in Europe, to which the Beligerent and neutral powers are invited. The ostinsible object is to regulate some matters of commerce and assertain the rights of neutral nations. Some important consequences will follow this meeting.  Not a word of the second divission of French, except that of their being block'd up in Brest.  The article in the newspaper respecting the Capture of the 50 British Merchantmen may be depended on. A week ago 2500 troops embarked from New York, if they are bound for the southward you will hear of it, probably, before this reaches you.  With due esteem I am, Sir, Your Most Obt., Humble Servt.

  Wednesday October 25. 1780. Present The Hon'ble Thomas McKean, Mr Walker & Mr Matlack  Messrs. Gibson & Forman proposed, and insisted with great warmth, that they would now proceed on in their defence of some of the charges exhibitted against the Commissioners of the Treasury.(1) The committee informed them, that this day was expressly appointed, at the desire of Mr. Forman & Mr. Gibson, to hear the evidence which they should offer in support of divers charges exhibitted by them against the Chambers of accotts. which the Committee are now ready to hear. Mr. Gibson insisted that their defence should now be heard. The committee insisted, that, much time having been wasted in this kind of altercation-and the evidences being noticed now to attend; they cannot and will not be led from the business now before us by especial appointment and at the request of the sd. Commsrs. Mr Gibson still persisting that he had a right to be heard on the former business-he was desired to sit down- And being seated was informed-That if the Commissioners had anything further to offer in their defence a time would be assigned for it; but that at present the committee adhered to their appointment of hearing the evidence in support of the charges against the Chambers of accounts-And request the evidence may be now brought forward. The letter from the Commissioners to the Committee containing the said charges was then read. Whereupon the Commisrs. of Treas. were called upon for their evidence in support of the Said charges. Mr Gibson-Thereupon named Mr Huston as one of the evidences. He was informed, that Mr Huston was not in the city-and reminded that the Witnesses alledged in the sd. letter for support of the charges therein contained were probably present, and it was remarked that Mr Houston was not mentioned in the letter as one of them.  Mr. Gibson said he declined going into the business until Mr Houston should attend.  Mr. Gibson-Asked whether the Committee would hear the defence of the Commissioners of Treasury?  The Committee-demanded to know whether the Commissioners would now produce the evidences against the Chambers of accounts? OCTOBER 25, 1780  To this Mr. Gibson Replied they could not proceed until Mr. Houston should appear-As he would prove every charge exhibitted against the Gent. of the Chambers; at least the most material ones- And he could not proceed on the business until Mr Houston should be present.  Mr. Govett, on behalf of the Chamber of accounts, Observed- That they understood this day to be appointed to hear the charges exhibitted against them and were now ready to Answer.  Mr. Nicholson and Mr. Wm. Ramsey, clerks in the chambers of accounts, being now present it was moved, by Mr. Matlack, that, the Witnesses mentioned in the Commissioners letter being present, they be now examined, Whereupon-Mr. Nicholson was called & examined.  Mr. Gibson and Mr. Forman, so repeatedly and so intendingly interrupted the examination, that it was not possible to proceed in the examination-and, having consulted together, they bundled up their papers and were about to retire-they reiterated their demand to be heard on the former business-which was declined by the Committee. They then insisted on the importance of Mr Houstons evidence. They had been repeatedly told, that the Committee would most certainly hear Mr Houstons evidence as soon as it could be obtained; and in the meantime determined to proceed in examining Mr. Nicholson.  Mr. Gibson & Mr Forman retired.  Mr. Nicholson says-He has been near two years in the chambers of accounts-and has observed very great neglect in attending at the office-That they (Commissioners of Accotts.) have been very negligent in their morning hours-not attending punctually at any hour but dropping in at 10. 11 oclock or frequently later (between 11 & 12)-that they rise at one and do not always attend in the afternoon, I think not above one third however put it down half. That of these Res. Smith (2) is the most negligent, Wm Geddis next, Mr. Mercier next, and Mr Govett the most punctual.  qu. Does Mr Fell attend?(3)  An. He is a new member and has been absent a great part of the time-And I can say very little as to Mr Fell-as I have been at Camp great part of the time since-That the times they do attend they spend much of their time in conversing on different subjects, such news, Politicks &c And are frequently so noisy in argumentation as to make it difficult and almost impracticable to do business in the same room. That until some time about the middle of July last, the subject of their pay was no small part of their conversation. There are some of these persons absent one or two days successively sometimes three or four at a time. They are frequently absent several weeks especially Mr Geddis shortly after his appointment for the first half year. When it has been talked of to ask leave of the Treasury, it has been said   particularly by Mr. Geddis that they would ask nobodys leave but go when they pleased. I have remarked that there have been several successive days in which there has been no public business done at all-frequently idle when I know there were people waiting at expence who wanted to have their Accots. setled.  That the Com. of Chambers generally leave the extensions & castings up to the Clerks. When one of the Com. examine an accott. alone-no other reexamines it, altho two allways sign. In examination of Vouchers they often read over only the name & sum and if these correspond they pass them.  qu. Do you know of any instance in which this practice has been a loss to the public?  An. I do not recollect any.  Inattention to the Public interest.  I know it in the instance of Dr. Foster's Accott. and of Coll. Wm Henry of Lancaster Accots. of Gun-Factory & shoe-factory, which they passed without examining the expenditure or appropriation of those articles-or even stating an accott. of the Amt. purchase which I stated as a work of supererogation & made several returns which they considered as a work of supererogation and Dr. Fosters Accotts. were passed without examination whether it had been properly appropriated or not. Coll. Morgan-a deputy Commissary of Purchases & issues of the western department-are in the same predicament-And the accounts of the appropriation of all Purchases are in my opinion very much neglected-And persons who observe them.  Incapacity.  Mr Govett & Mr Mercier are very capable of transacting the business of the office, especially Mr. Govett, Mr. Geddis & Mr Smith, I think are not.  qu. Upon what do you found this Opinion?  An. With respect to Mr. Smith, shortly after I came into the office, I observed his incapacity even to cast a column; in which he committed errors-Mr Nourse, accounts late pay M[aster] of Board of war & ordnance were then under examination. The advances were taken out & stated by themselves apart-this business was assigned to Mr Smith by Mr. Milligan, then a Com. of the Chambers. Mr Smith puzzled himself two or three days in this but could [not] bring it to correspond with the account before it was transposed-he at length gave it to me and I did-he did it twice or thrice wrong. This instance I the better remember as I had newly came into the office and wondered that a man of no greater abilities should be put into a post of so great importance.  I speak of Mr Smith & Mr Geddis.  The first account they took up together was E Boudinots, Com. of Prisrs.-in the stating of this they could not please the auditor OCTOBER 25,1780  general-after trying it twice or thrice, Mr Geddis said in passion he would have nothing more to do with it-where upon I took up the accots. and from my state of it they found great fault. Another instance is in their late re-exam of Colo. Sweer's (4) accot. which the books will show their errors-the book is here if the Committee will please to examine it.  See p . 85. Compared 95 & 96 also 116,117 differing in the ballance and in the name of James Patton instead of John Patton-several errors in this account I pointed out which occasioned its recommitment.  Refers to a letter wrote by Mr. Geddis & others assigning reasons for requesting that Sweer's accott. might be recommitted.  Mr. Gibson now returned.  The letter requested the recommitment of the accots. (Mr Geddis, says) in consequence of some errors discovered by him. Mr. Nicholson-says there were Vouchers which ought to have been examined before the accott. was rendered. That the errors amended in the last accott. were the effect of notes made by Mr. Milligan.  Observes the credit in Sweers accounts of large Sums pd. to Mr. Watkins, French & Mr Lukens which was wrong; and it ought to have been adjusted with Mr Watkins and he not charged.  Mr Geddis observes this was in consequence of the orders of the Treasury to strike the ballance of his accots.  Note-These charges were proper in the best form. P. 116. Credit in Sweers's Account.  Mr. Geddis requested that Sweers Accott. may be had & Mr. Gibson said it was ready whenever the Committee should require it.  Adjourned to 10 o'clock tomorrow.(5)  ""

  Dear Sir,(1) Philadia. Octr. 26th. 1780. Your favor of the 23d instant just now came to hand, and in answer to the material part of it must inform you, that the Committee of Congress on the proposal for a general exchange of prisoners have made a report, which has been recommitted, and a second report is not yet given in, but that I believe it will be done in the beginning- of the ensuing week, and that it will take place.(2) On a consideration of these circumstances I am apt to think your situation is somewhat difficult, but I would venture to recommend it as best, if your health & other affairs will permit to join us (3) at Easton, and if any Orders should arrive from the Board of war or Commissary General of Prisoners during your absence that you should leave instructions to forward them to you at Reading, where I am pretty confident we shall be by the time you will be wanted. If you should entertain any doubts on this head we shall excuse you with the greatest pleasure.  I am anxious to see you, I confess, and we want your advice respecting the time of holding a court at Lancaster, but would foregoe this pleasure, if I conceived it could be attended with the least inconvenience to you. The ride to Easton is not the most agreeable, and the great distance I am aware of, but I consider you as one that I hope will be my Successor, and I cannot foresee the consequences which may follow from the fluctuating state of the Members of our Council & Assembly, and therefore would be glad of your attendance at every court practicable.  The reasons you have assigned for your absence from this & Chester are perfectly satisfactory, and I am only concerned that you should have mentioned any, as your bretheren had no doubt of your attention in this particular from former experience, and that you were prevented by indisposition, other public business, or some such cause.  No news of consequence except what the News-papers will furnish. Mr. Bryan is pretty well-I am something better. I write this in Congress (4) must bid you Adieu.

9388,dg016216,1780,Treasury Inquiry Committee Minutes,"""Treasury Inquiry Committee Minutes
  Thursday October 26th. 1780 Present Hn'ble Mr. McKean, Mr. Walker & Mr. Matlack.  It was proposed, that the accotts. of Sweers should be ordered from the Treasury, Mr. Geddis having informed the Committee, that the Treasury had refused him the accounts on his application without the orders of the Committee. Mr. Nicholson said he had now brought the accounts-On which Mr. Geddis, observed, that it was very hard that a clerk of the office should be furnished with the account and he (Geddis) refused, and by that means prevented from the means of making his defence.  The mode of stating the account of Colo. Sweers being examined and the charge of P[artiality] made against Watkins, French & Lukens (1) and it appears clearly to be strictly correct and in the special OCTOBER 26, 1780  instant before us the only possible correct mode-and in the stile of an accomptant. See also the Defence in the double charges in Sweers's accotts. which appears to amount exactly to the same thing, as would have arisen in the opposed case-to wit a just ballance. The objection to the expression in the charge P[artiality] pd. J Donaldson-on examination the expression \""he\"" [Sweers] is doubtful and appears has led the Auditor Genl. into an error in his report and state of the Accot. by charging Mr. Donaldson with the sum. But the charge refers to the Accot., Numbered, and the Accot. referred to, shews what the goods were that the money was paid and for which goods \""he,\"" Sweers, was to be accountable.  Of Partiality.(2)  \""I conceive there has been something of it-as well in the dispatch of the accounts themselves. \"" I think Mr Dunlaps account is partial the deduction I think is unreasonable-(the account exhibitted). Observes that Mr. Dunlap charges the delay of his accott. to the Treasury-whereas it was the fault of the Chambers.  qu. By Mr. McKean. How does the partiality appear, did it appear to be from resentments against Mr. Dunlap or from a disposition not to do justice?  An. He could not say.  Ob. by Mr. Govett. That Mr. Dunlap was a particular acquaintance and they could not intend to injure him.  Observ. by Mr. Nicholson. Mr. Bradfords accounts were allowed with much less scrutiny & greater dispatch.  An. By Mr. Govett. That Bradfords accounts were for News Paper and therefore could not need any scrutiny which could occasion delay.  Mr. Nicholson. Mr. Shaws account was delayed, which I really believe was from envy. Mr Smith said he should get nothing by his crossness. Mr. Kenon his accounts were delayed-some of the Gent., I dont know which, intimated that it was delayed on accott. of his moroseness. Mr. Claypooles accounts were delayed a great while. I cannot but say I think there was partiality in favour of Mr. Hopkinsons account; I dont pretend to be a judge of the service, but I really think so. My reasons are these. The accotts. brought for services they were unacquainted with the value of. They were taken to some persons adjudged to be competent to judge of them. For instance engraving, they applied to Mr. Few for his opinion of Normans (3) charges-and in these reports citing their opinions. An instance, exhibitted in favour of some of the Coms of Pennsylvania- being allowed 2 & others 2 1/2 per Ct. Commission.  Accounted for by resolve of Congress passed in the intermediate time.  Arndts accott. page 141.  Trickets accott., explained. When his accott. was under examination, the work was taken to Woodhouse and he was asked what   he would do such work for-and the price was fixed according to his offer in the case.  Mr. Geddis said, after Hopkinsons accott. was exhibitted, that accomptants who would obtain from the Treasury just pay for their services ought to charge one half more than it was worth.  Mr Smith said that instead of the accotts. being detained too long-they were exhibitted too soon-for obtaining a fee-as was customary in England-but he at the same time expressed his detestation of fees. Whether he was serious or not does not know.  Mr. Govett-observes he perfectly remembers the occasion of the sentiment-it was on the subject of the low state of the Treasury.  Mr Nicholson Said he was right it was so.  qu. By Mr McKean. Do you know anything of the Gent. of the Chambers maligning the Com. of the Treasury?  An. I have heard them speaking slightingly of the Com. of Tr. and sneeringly speak of the superior mode of doing business and particularly on the order of the Tr. on corresponding with accomptants.  qu. Before whom?  An. The Chambers were more like a Coffee house than a place of accounts.  List of Accotts passed since 5th May last said to be designed for a Committee of Congress and to deceive them; but it does not appear to be used for any purpose whatever.  Mr. Ramsay.(4)  qu. What do you know of any of the charges exhibitted by the Com. of the Treasury agst. the Chamber of accounts?  An. I did not expect to be called upon to give testimony on this subject and have not taken any Minutes of them; But I suppose it will be allowed by all that more business might have been done. I suppose this was owing to the particular difficulties they were under; which I have often heard them express.  qu. Do you know of any particular instance of neglect?  An. Mr Nicholson has, I believe, mentioned every instance which could possibly have come under my observation, if I had taken the pains to have minuted them.  Of Indolence.(5) That seems to be nearly the same thing. Inattention to the public interest.  [Qu.] Do you know of any thing particular on this head?  An. If they were indolent they must have been so far inattentive to the public interest; but of this I don't know whether I am a competent judge or not.  Incapacity.  [Qu.] Do you know of any instance of their incapacity?  An. To answer this it would be necessary that I should have abilities superior to them; which I am conscious I have not.  Partiality.  [qu.] Do you know of any instance of partiality in passing some accounts more readily than others; or in allowing more for services done by one than by another?  An. I do not. What Mr Nicholson has said on this head will fully comprehend every thing which I have heard or seen.  Opposing the Board.  [qu.] Do you know of anything of their opposing the Board of Treasury in refusing to occupy a Chamber assigned them?  An. I know no more of this subject than is contained in their letters to Congress.  Maligning &c.  [qu.] Do You know anything of the Chambers of accounts Maligning the Commissioners of the Treasury and to whom?  An. I have heard the Gent. of the Chambers frequently complain of the order of the Treasury respecting the Chambers Corresponding with persons on their accotts-And particularly to Major Hodgdon (6)  qu. What was said to Major Hodgson?  An. His accott. wanted some explanation and I went for him- they told him it was not altogether consistent with the orders of the Treasury to hold any communication with him.  [qu.] Do you know of any other instance?  An. No.  [qu.] Do you know of any thing else which you have not mentioned?  An. No.  qu. By Mr. Nicholson-To which it was objected, that the complaint being made by the Com. of Tr. any questions necessary to be asked on this charge ought to be asked by them; not by Mr. Nicholson.  Qu. At what hours do the Commissioners of the Chambers attend?  An. Generally between the hours of 9 & 10 in the morning and remain 'till one and sometimes after.  qu. What hours do they attend in the afternoon?  An. Between three & four-soon after 3 generally.  qu. How long do they remain in office?  An. Till six; some times after.  qu. By Mr. Nicholson. Do they attend punctually at those hours?  An. When the business appear to require it; and Mr Govett & Mr. Mercier have attended during last summer rather between 8 and 9 than later-the other Gent. on accotts. of more magnitude not so early; as they are not under the same necessity.  Mr. Ramsey.  qu. By Mr. Nicholson. Have there not been successive days, three, four or more, in which they have done no business?   An. I dont recollect any such; except in the case of the order of the Treasury to the Auditor General not [to] send any more accotts to the Chambers 'till they had reported on those before them. At that time I as well as they was unemployed for some time.  qu. When the Commissioners are in office is there more of their time spent in idle conversation than in business?  An. They generally enter upon business in a few minutes after they enter the office; except some particular times. As to their conversation I have not paid particular attention to it.  qu. Have you not heard them uncommonly often speak of their pay?  An. I have heard them often say, before the late resolves of Congress were passed, that unless some better provision were made for them they should be obliged to resign?  qu. Have you ever observed any alteration in the behaviour of the Chambers, upon the Commissioners of the Treasury passing by? An. I think I never did. I have heard some of the Chambers observe the Com. of the Treasury looked very sharp into the Chambers.  qu. Have you not heard some of them say-Mind your business there go [. . .] your Masters?  An. I have; but dont remember by whom.  [qu.] Were not the Accotts. of Mr. Flowers exhibitted according to the label on the box of 20th Jany. 1779?  An. Yes. Note-there has been no orders for passing them.  qu. Are there not other accounts, particularly the Accotts. of the Barrack Mr. Genl. and his dependents still in the office?  An. There are such accotts.  qu. Have you not frequently heard me say I have examined those accotts. ?  An. Yes.  [qu.] Are there not other accounts?  An. Yes.  Ob. By the Chambers that there is a list of them ready for inspection.  Mr. Nourse. Col. Melchior (7) has rendered two accotts. which have been examined in some sort by Coll. Melchior and the vouchers for others; but the accounts are not rendered, it is expected, that he will render a further accott, when the whole will be examined together.  Letter of 29 June 1780.(8) To Commiss. of Treasury-with a list of accounts in the Chambers & remarks.  Mr. Nicholson-says there is a great deal to do to Colo. Morgans (9) account and Dr Fosters (10) accounts-That Colo. Morgans accounts are setled incompleatly and reports made upon with that precision which is necessary for the public security-and the accotts. referred to.  Observation, by Mr. Mercier. That there were many Vouchers wanting of Colo Morgans accotts. and application had been made to him for them. That as there appeared to be a ballance in the hands of Colo. Morgan it was thought best to report the ballance especially- and leave the compleat and finally adjustment until the vouchers should be produced. The accotts. were thus reported, in order that the Money due from him might be paid. (See 18 Feby. (page 71.)  Adjourned 'till six this evening.  Mr. Gibson and Mr. Forman (11)-Were now informed that the Committee would probably be able this evening to hear the Defence which they should think proper to add to that already offered. Mr. Gibson said he had not been informed, That the Committee would hear them-to which it was replied that he was five dift. times yesterday, expressly told, that they should be heard. He then said- They were not ready and could not be ready; as it would take some time to prepare. To this it was observed-That Mr. Gibson & Forman had peremptorily, and very often repeated, demanded to be heard in their defence yesterday-When the Committee had appointed that day to hear the charges against the Chamber of Accotts. and declared their being then ready to go into their defence.  The same day 6 in the evening.  Present Mr. McKean, Mr Walker & Mr Matlack.  The Gent. of the Chambers of accounts in defence. Produce-Mr. Nourse.  Mr. Nourse  qu. by Mr. Mercier. How long have we lived together?  An. From the 26 Sept. 1779 to same day 1780.  qu. During that time have you known any instance of my being absent 2, 3 or 4 days from my business except only once on a visit to my parents?  An. I cannot say I recollect any such instance except once by sickness-and once in translating a paper of interesting news (the proceedings of Parliament in French). As this testimony may operate against Mr. Nicholsons evidence, I should be glad he would remind me of any particular instance-several times were mentioned which Mr Nourse cannot recollect to have happened.  qu. What hours have I generally attended the office and at what hours have I usually left the office?  An. As we resided in the same house we generally came home about 1 oclock sometimes not 'til past two.  qu. What hours did you attend in the afternoon?  An. About 3 or a quarter after & returned in summer at about 6-in winter about 5. The Morning we considered as the most precious part of the day.   Qu. As you were frequently in the office, did you ever perceive me indolent?  An. Upon that Question I should beg leave to observe; that altho by the Ordinance two Chambers are appointed and four clerks the Gent. have done business, in one Chamber with two clerks. With respect to the Gent. who compose the first Chamber, who I understood to be Mr Govett, Mr. Mercier & Mr Govett [i. e. Geddis], whenever I have had any business to do in that Chamber, I have generally observed Mr. Govett & Mr Mercier to be employed upon large accounts. Previous to the nomination of the two last commissioners, I understood Mr Smith to rank as senior Commissioner of the second Chamber-and I have understood from Mr Geddis who I have understood to be a Commissioner of the first Chamber, employed with Mr. Smith in the settlement of small accounts which might be daily presented, with a view as I understood by Mr Geddis to expedite public business. Mr Smith, Senior Com. of the 2nd had no proper Chambers until the late order of the Board.  Qu. Have not we brought old accounts to the Auditors office to be referred, that we might be employed?  An. There were several accotts. which had been lodged in the Chambers of Accotts. before the late establishment of the Treasury. I recollect that accotts. have been brought in for settlement with a view, I believe that the Chambers might go upon business. But they were accounts strangely rendered.  Qu. Have you not heard the Commissioners of the Chambers frequently complain of Mr Nicholsons indolence?  An. I have heard that remark frequently made-how justly I cannot judge. If I was to judge by Mr. Nicholsons coming to office I should suppose he was attentive.  Qu. (By Mr. Geddis.) Have not you always heard the commissioners of Chambers express their desires to carry on the Public business with dispatch?  An. I have no doubt that that observation has been made but I cannot recollect particulars. The Gent. have frequently complained of the want of room which made it impossible to carry on the business so well as they might other wise have done-and indeed I have observed the fact to be so.  Qu. Was not the reason given by us-That Mr Gibson had, for his own private use, one of the best rooms in the house which we thought we had as good a right to as he had?  An. Yes-I understand that to a reason assigned in your letter before Congress.  Qu. Was not another reason, That the room up two pair of stairs proposed for the Chambers of accounts, had a large quantity of paper made for striking of money which had perished & become very offensive?  An. Yes it was and the room was very disagreeable.  qu. by Mr Nicholson. Has not the room occupied by Mr. Gibson been vacant for near two months?  An. Mr Gibson moved out of the house at the expiration of the lease, after which we remained upon sufferance to this time and have expected to remove which rendered it unnecessary & improper to remove into that room.(12)  Note-That Mr. Denning had desired no large accots. might be taken up until they removed.  qu. by the Committee. Have you seen any instance of inability of Mr Smith one of the Chambers of accounts, as to casting accots?  An. The reports are generally signed by two of the Commissioners of accotts. and I know of no particular instance of that kind.  Mr. Govett-remarked, That when Mr Smith came first into office he was not so finished an accomptant as one wholly bred to that business; but he now draws reports with great propriety.  Mr. Geddis-that Mr Smith is sufficiently ready at casting accounts and the kinds of business in which he is employed and is good man in every respect. He is now ill otherwise these remarks would not have been made by the Commissioners.  Mr. Ramsey (again examined).  qu. By Mr Mercier. Do you know of my having been absent 2 ,3 ,4 or 5 days at a time frequently or at any time except when I went to visit my parents?  An. I am sure I dont know of your being absent more than half a day at any one time-except the time of your visiting your parents.  qu. Who has given the best attendance in the office-the Commissioners; or Mr Nicholson?  An. I cannot decide upon that matter.  qu. Has Chamber No. 1 ever been without business?  An. I dont recollect any instance of several days except that mentioned above, And Mr Fell & Mr Govett waited for me while Mr. Nicholson was at camp last summer-When I could not go on fast enough to keep them employed.  qu. Did not we direct you in what manner to proceed upon the examination of Dr. Foster accotts?  An. Yes-I remember something of it: but do not clearly recollect it-it will appear by the accott. in whose handwriting it is.  qu. by Mr Geddis. Was not you by when I called Mr. Nicholson to account for neglect of business?  An. He was absent, I suppose on his own business, and you found fault with him for it-as I understood it.  Mr. McCall, (13) Extra. Commissioner of accounts.  qu. By Mr. Mercier. Which has given the most constant attendance at the Chambers Mr. Nicholson or the Commissioners?  An. As I have given pretty constant attendance at the Chamber  of Accotts. for near [. . .] I have had an oppty of knowing, and I have frequently observed, that Mr Nicholson generally came the last to and was the first that went from the Chamber before any of the Commissioners of accounts.  qu. Do you think Mr. Nicholson was capable from his own attendance of forming a proper judgment of our doing the duty of our office?  An. I do not, for the reason above given of his not paying a proper attention himself to the business of the office.  qu. by Mr Nicholson-Have not I been more generally at the office before you than after you?  An. If I had not been more frequently there before you than after you I should have been able to have answered the questions above asked-And I have frequently made the observations contained in the above answers to the Gent. heretofore. I have been clerk in the office and know what hours ought to be kept.  qu. by do. As the conduct of the Commissioners and my conduct are compared together-When we were in the office which seemed to be most engaged in business, they or me?  An. I think the Commissioners-but I dont particular think myself capable of judging what Mr. Nicholson is employed. He & Mr. Ramsay seem to be employed in some business which they had undertaken before I have been in office.  qu. (By Mr. Nicholson to Mr Ramsay). Have not I been more frequently in office in the morning before Mr. McCall than after- and also in the afternoon-referring to the time in which I was attending at the office distinguished from the time I was at, and preparing to go to camp?  An. I have known Mr. McCall to come several times after Mr Nicholson has been at business.  qu. by Mr. McCall, Have I not been frequently at the office before any others, except yourself, who I found generally there the first?  An. You frequently were there before Mr Nicholson; but I rather think Mr Nicholson was there before Mr McCall as often as after him-but I cannot say particularly as I kept no account of that matter. Mr McCalls business did not immediately lie there.  (Note Mr McCall is intended to go to the Eastward on business there.) Remarks by Mr Mercier.  As to negligence and indolence they are nearly of the same nature and they will need no observation from us. An appeal to the register and list of Accotts reported and remaining will shew how the business stands.  As to partiality-in the case of Mr. Hopkinson-the Committee appear to be fully possessed of the facts-the case of Mr Gibson. (see report [page 87] March 17. 80 referred March 3. 1780).  Certificates respecting the manner of paying the rent of the house, by Mr Gibson to Mrs Maddox the owner.(14) That Mr. Gibson having it constantly in his power to receive the rent, ought not to be now allowed the depreciation to the present time, estimating from the begining of the accott. &c. That Mr. Gibson states his charging only £80 per an. Whereas his Accott. exhibitted shows that he charged £116 per an. Mr. Gibson, the Commissioners say, observed that he charged £116 per annum because he thought the public ought to make good to him the rent accruing while the enemy was in the city. That Mr. Gibson occupied [one] of the best rooms of the house, two of the cellars, & the stables C[. . .] house, and the messenger attended his horse and the servants provided his breakfast and supper.  Of Mr. Bicking Accott. March 29th 1780 (page 97) (15)  The Commissioners asked of Mr. Bradford the price of old canvas at the time it was d[livere]d to Mr Bicking, and were informed that the price credited in his accott. was the price it then really sold for-see reasons assigned to the Treasury for their allowance of Bickings Accott. 29 March 80.  Observe-That the price of canvas being debated the account was suspended from March 'til May when the paper maker consented to be charged 5/6 per lb rather than be longer kept out of his money & suffer thereby the depreciation; but the price of paper was finally allowed by the Treasury-so that if the allowance for the price of paper was unreasonable and blameworthy in the Commissioners of accounts, it was equally blameable in the Com. of Treasury who finally allowed and paid it.  The report on James Dills (16) account contained remarks on the want of Vouchers and contain the returns of provisions purchased-& return of provisions issued which shews the Treasury had not adverted to the report and papers attending-otherwise their remand of that accott. of 7th July 80 could not have been sent.  See also Letter book of Chambers March 23. 1780.  William Scott (17) another Commissioner respecting deficiency on vouchers of his account.  The Order of the 5th of May 80 from the Treasury directing no further accounts to be sent to the Chambers until those already there were liquidated-which occasioned several days delay. The Chambers being then employed on Mr Hillegas's accounts, which could not be liquidated for want of the charges against him. And had that order been strictly obeyed the Chambers must have been unemployed for several months. And they remark that of 200 Mills. actually delivered to Mr. Hillegas there is charged in the Treasury books but about 36 Mills. Note-This Mr Hillegas, may perhaps explain and Mr. Govett may also throw some light upon. This ought to be enquired into as a capital neglect some where.   Observation on the charge respecting Dr. Warners accot. & Mr. Henrys accot. The reports on these accots. were in Consequence of express orders from the Treasury 12 May 1780 \""to report without delay on all accounts referred to therr without waiting for additional vouchers or alterations of circumstances,\"" (18) and strictly according to the duty of the Chambers. (Note. And on examination it clearly so appears).  The difficulties of expenditure of stores require a Chamber for that branch-and this has been stated to Mr. Huston who agrees to the propriety of it.(19)  ""

  Dr. Tucker Philadelphia Octr. 27th 1780 I do not at all wonder at the Consultation held on my letter written when under the influence of that cursed fever, but rather admire that you found Consistency enough in it to furnish out any allusion. My senses were so Jumbled at the time of writing that you shd have taken even the effort as the strongest argument of my regard. But Since so important a matter as that of drinking my health depends on my decyphering the OEnigma-I must inform you that it is or rather was a Bona fide fever with which I was affected which had (from its effects left on the Bones being Similar to those which I suppose are felt from a Severe Cudgeling) acquired in this Place where few people have escaped it the nickname of Broke Bone fever. I am Sorry to find that Hygeia as well a[s] Ceres has not Chosen Sapponi for her Residence-but from my Ideas of Matoax (1) fear you have little mended the matter by seeking for the Goddess there, Altho Apollo in his Cantator Capacity dwells there when you design to make it the Tent of your residence. Yet I wish not to see him there in his later (2) function-or rather wish not that you shd have occasion to invoke him-however propitious the God may be inclined to be-I have no great opinion of his Priests tho I formerly had the honor of officiating in his Temple myself.

The Matters before Congress are at this time so weighty-so numerous, so important, so interesting-and most of them so essential to be kept secret untill they are prepared to be known that you will readily excuse my not entering on the subject-which were I at liberty freely to write on would take almost a Quire of Paper to give you any Satisfactory Idea of.

  Sir, Morris Town, State of New Jersey Octr 27. 1780 I have been duly honored by your agreable favour of the 24th OCTOBER 27, 1780  Ultimo, Inclosing a letter to the director general, (1) which has been delivered.  Since the 22d November, the date of a letter you mention to have received, I have wrote two other letters, (2) containing such matters as I should be unwilling to have fallen into the possession of some persons, whose heads and hearts, are unworthy of my confidence, and who I fear have filch'd those letters under way, as you make no mention of having received them.  It appears to me, Sir, your apprehensions are well founded, when you observe, \""I fear the season is much too far advanced for any decisive operations to be attempted against New York, this Campaign\"" &c., and that your queries claim the highest attention when you farther add, \""may not the winter be most profitably employed in retaking Charles-Town, and recovering the two southern States, from our enemies &c\"". The reasons you mention in favour of the attempt, are weighty, and the successes, which have lately attended our Arms in that quarter render the operations you have proposed, both for the winter & spring, less hazardous.  The spirited exertions of your state in raising three Thousand recruits for the Continental Army, and One thousand good western Militia, at so critical a period, evinces a redoubled attachment to our cause, and add much to the prospect of success in our operations in that vicinity.  I cannot quit the subject, without congratulating you, my dear Sir, on the appointment of Major General Greene, to take the command of the southern Army. That gentlemans great abilities in the field, his extensive knowledge of the various departments in the Army, gives him the advantage of almost every other General Officer in America, in immediately reducing to order and System an Army and affairs, which at present are almost \""without form and void\"".  But alass of what avail will be the exertion of the greatest Generals, unless fully aided with men, money, and the other necessary supplies? In the present deranged situation of our public affairs, can this aid be furnished? Our Treasury is empty-Our Military and ordnance stores in that quarter are much exhausted-and I fear, the resources of that Country under its present embarrassments will prove incompetent for those other supplies.  Your Zeal and exertion in the cause of our distressed Country on every former occasion forbids my mentioning a single argument to induce your utmost efforts in the present alarming conjuncture.  General Greene entertains a high opinion of your influence and abilities, and wishes for your assistance, in support of such measures as he may find necessary to adopt for recovering the southern states, or rather what is more probable, to prevent the Enemy, from making further progress, and as the General is a gentleman in whom you may place the most unreserved confidence, not only as an Officer,  but as a private gentleman, have not the least reason to doubt but there will be a perfect harmony, and free correspondence, between you and that gentleman; and which I am sure will be assiduously cultivated on his part.  The Honorable Arthur Lee, passed through this place a few days since, on his way to Philadelphia; but I was so unhappy as not to have the pleasure of seing him, though I have been honored by a line from him since his arrival there.  As the present situation of the southern States bespeak the Theatre of War, at least for the insuing winter, I should esteem it an addition to the obligations I should otherwise be under, by being favor'd with a letter from you, as often as you may find oppertunity and leisure for that purpose.  With sentiments of real friendship, I have the honor to be, Sir, Your Most Obedient And very Humble servant,  Nathl. Peabody ""

  My Dear sir Philadelphia Octr. 30th 1780. I am favoured with yours inclosing a Letter to Mr McCarty, which I immediately Sent to him. The House rent you mention I shall Confer with him about, and whatever is necessary, shall be done, if within my power. I also thank you for your favour of the 27th Instant, by the post. I am very Sorry you was put to the Expence of postage, on Account of my neglect. Am afraid you had a very bad penny worth.  Congress this day received intelligence of the Cavalry part of the Tories lately embarked at New York, being landed at Portsmouth in Virginia, the rest of their fleet were in sight.(1) General Green is now here on his way to take the Command of the Southern Army. He leaves this place tomorrow or next day. Much is expected from his experience, prudence and abillities. Baron Stuben is also to join the Army in that quarter as is Major Lees Corps of Light Horse. The Enemy at New York have been lately reinforced with about 800 Germans, and about 1200 British Troops. This may enable them to Send Some more men to the Southward. Many they Cant Spare from New York and their [out]posts. Doct. Lee is now in Town, he has applied to be heard, [in ju]stification of his Conduct, while in public Service. Congress does not incline to go into the enquiry at present. The matter will be put of in such way as may give some Satisfaction and prevent the time of the House being taken up.  OCTOBER 30, 1780  The state of our public affairs wear a most melancholly Aspect. Instead of being able to extricate ourselves from the embarrassments we have been long under for want of Money, our expences and distresses are daily encreasing-two armies to feed, Cloath and pay, without money or the means of getting Any. Borrowing here is at an End, no one will lend, And foreign Loans I am afraid are not to be obtained. France we are told is so far from being in a Condition to Supply us, that She is Solliciting Loans herself to Carry on the War, And the Cursed Claim set up to the free navagation of the Mississippi, and the extention of our limits to that river, will if insisted on prevent an Alliance with Spain, or of procuring Any Aids from her. The Jealousys of that Court respecting Contraband, will be hard to be removed, And it is probable nothing will Satisfy their fears on that Score, but relinquishing our Claim to the navagation of that river. I wish for my part it Could be given up Conditionally. The Claim if granted Could not be of any immediate Advantage to us, and the State of our Affairs require it. I am of Opinion With you, that a few Millions of hard Dollars would go a great way in putting our finances into proper order, but Could a foreign Loan of hard money be obtained, the hazard of getting it here would be very great, and Bills of Exchange would not Answer the purpose of Calling in our old money. It is difficult to Account [for] the rapid depreciation of the Continental Currency, but I have been for a long time of opinion that it proceeds more from the nature of our trade, than from any other Cause Whatever. Most of our Valuable produce is prohibited from being exported; this Obliges the foreigners who come to trade Amongst us, after laying out part of the money Arising from the Sail of their Cargoes in Li[vres?], to purchase Gold and Silver with the rest. This enhances the price of hard money and raises the Exchange between that and paper; hence it is no uncommon thing to see Exchange raised 4 or 5 prices, in a day or two, And this is an evil that will Continually encrease while our imports are so much larger than our exports, the difference must be made up in gold & Silver, and as that is daily going from us, and none brought in, it becomes Scarcer, and of Course the difference of Value between that And paper will be the greater. All dealings in this place, (And I suppose it is the Case everywhere Else) is rated in gold and silver payable in paper at the Exchange. This way of dealing makes the Shop Keeper, Tradesman, and labourer rather incline to favour a rise in the Exchange between hard money and paper than otherwise, and I have observed that the Sail of a few half Joes (and purchased perhaps by a person who has a number to sell) has in a day or two established the Exchange throughout the Town. The Citizens find their Account in it. The Farmers and others who bring their goods to Market, dont so soon find out the difference, they sell every thing for paper and the price has been nearly the Same for meat &c ever  since I have been in Town, tho hard money has advanced twenty percent.  You will in a few days receive resolves of Congress for raising Six millions of hard Dollars, or money of the new Emission part in Specific Supplies.(2) Our part of that Sum will be about a Ninth- about 550,000 payable in Specific Supplies (without [any] alternative) and the rest in money-a heavy Tax but must [be] Complyed with, or inevitable ruin of our affairs must be [the] Consequence. I know who I am writing to, and therefore deliver my Sentiments with freedom And the Situation of our Affairs require it. My Compliments to the president and the rest of your Honble Board, Mr Carroll and the Ladies and am with best Wishes for your health, Dear sir Your most hble Servt, John Hanson  [P.

OCTOBER 30, 1780  If I at any time send you a surplus Journal you can deliver it to Mr. Avery. I now forward July & Sepr.

Govr. Jefferson writes with a proper Spirit and Nelson acts with the same But the latter is not able to prevent the Invaders from securing such Passes as suit their Views.  I fear we call for too many men to have a proper Army. I think myself Soldier enough to do the Business of this Continent with 25000 well armed, well cloathed and well fed Effectives, much better than with double the Number deficient in those three points.

  Sir,(1) Philada. Octr. 31. 1780. Herewith I enclose a Resolution of the 12th Inst.(2) granting half pay for Life, as well to Officers reduced as to Others. This Resolution is a kind of Suplement to the Resolution of the 3d directing a Reduction of the Army. On this precipetate, and in my Opinion, injudicious Act of Congress it is un[ne]cessary, perhaps improper for me to make any Comments; it speaks for it self, and in a Language which in New Jersey will be better understood than Relished. The States which had Established halfpay for life to the Officers of their Lines, Aided by N. York who entertains Simular Sentiments forced this measure upon us; A Measure contrary to the Genius & Political ideas of the New England states & New Jersey.  In Opposition to this Resolution it was urged that the measure was unjust, improper & altogether Unnecessary to be forced upon the States who Opposed it, as it was of no Consequence to the United States in what mode any particular state gave Sattisfaction and rendered justice to their Officers, provided they kept their Regiments properly Officered, which there could be no doubt would be done where the mode of doing it was left to themselves, whereas a Measure so disgustful would irretate and prevent the exertions so Necessary at this Time; but no reasons could prevail upon Men fixed & determined. What is now to be done? Will, or Will not our Legislature Remonstrate against this procedure, and insist upon an exemption. If they mean not to sit down easy and quiet under this Act, the sooner they explain themselves upon the Subject the better, as I believe no reductions have yet been made in the Army. OCTOBER 31, 1780  As some persons are of opinion it would be of general Utility for Congress to repeal that part of the Resolution of the 18th of March which Admits of receiving one Dollar of the New emission in Lieu of 40 of the old; it may be proper for the Legislature to instruct their Delegates upon the Subject in case they think the measure Adviseable. This hath not been moved in Congress nor do I know that it will. I do not in this wish to call off your Attention from more important matters unless you think this a matter of Consequence. The Subject I have not Considered maturely since the New emission is passing where issued at a depreciation of near one half: owing as is Supposed to fixing the same at one for forty of the old emission. The expectation of Congress in that Act was, that the New bills would fix the Value of the old, but we find the Value of the new is fixed and Varies with the old. As the Laws of our State are Conformable to the Resolutions of Congress your Delegates cannot consent to any Alteration without your direction, should the same be moved and become ever so Necessary Under the present Change of Circumstances. This tie makes any consideration of the Subject unnecessary in your Delegates without your particular Orders for that purpose.  I have the honour to be, Sir, With all proper regard, Your Obedt. Humble Servt., Abra. Clark.  ""

  Dear Sir Philada. Octr. 31. 1780 Your favor of the 23 came to hand yesterday. (1) We received notice of the invasion of Virga. yesterday morning and more fully last evening. I am sensible of the great difficulties you will have to contend with and that no practicable exertions can save the State from much injury whilst the Enemy have a total command of the Bay & rivers. The meeting of the Legislature at this juncture is fortunate. They will certainly arm the Executive with all the authorities requisite to call forth the military resources of the Country. This could be necessary at any time, but the emptiness of the Treasury makes it peculiarly so in the present moment.  Congress have felt a becoming resentment of the barbarous treatment of the gentlemen in captivity at Charlestown, and have directed General Washington to require of Clinton an explanation  NOVEMBER 1, 1780  of the matter. Nothing has yet been done in consequence of it except an application to Clinton, which as he had at that time not been officially informed of the fact, he evaded by general assurances of the humanity &c. of Cornwallis. Gen Washington had very luckily between the application & the answer received two of the Earl's bloody proclamations which he very handsomely communicated to Sr. Harry.(2)  The motions of our Allies are no less mysterious here than they appear to you. We have however experienced so many proofs of their wisdom & goodness towards us, that we ought not on slight grounds to abate our faith in them. For my own part I have as yet great confidence in both.  I recollect nothing to be added to the inclosed paper, except the arrival of about 2000 German & British recruits at N. York.

Paul Jones & Capt Landais and Some other Gentlemen whose Duty it was to Promote the Service, Dr. Franklins Express Orders for Shiping the Cloathing was Disobeyed and the Importation wholly Prevented. This is a sumary Conclusion from the Facts that appear from Letters and  NOVEMBER 4, 1780  Testimony now in the Admiralty Office but not in the hand of the President of Congress.  Your Excy will Please to Consider this as a Private Letter or to be Communicated as shall be thought Prudent.  The Inclosed is the News of the Day. The Account of the Landing of French Troops at Louiburg as mentioned in the Paper is by no Means Authentic. I wish it, and the Evacuation of Virginia by the Enemy may both Prove True. I am with the greatest Respect yr Excys Most Obedt Huml Servt, Benj Huntington  ""

  [November 5, 1780](1) The great depreciation of money and the extravagant prices of every thing here together with the difficulty of negociating Bills renders it absolutely necessary that some stable provision shoud be made, & some fixed mode adopted for supplying us with money, other wise we shall not be able to exist, we shoud be glad to be informed on this head as soon as possible.(2) Reprinted from Madison, Papers (Hutchinson), 2:160.  (1) The endorsement on this brief extract, probably written by Jefferson's clerk, indicates that it was prepared from a November 5 letter from the Virginia delegates that has since been lost. The original may have been written by Theodorick Bland whose financial distress in Philadelphia was apparently more acute than that of his fellow delegates-James Madison and John Walker-and whom Jefferson specifically mentioned in submitting this extract to the Virginia House of Delegates. See Jefferson, Papers (Boyd), 4:121.  (2) From his November 10 letter to James Madison it is clear that Joseph Jones had been striving \""to forward money to the Delegates\"" since he had returned to Virginia in September, but found he \""could not effect it.\"" Indeed, the House of Delegates approved the accounts submitted by the delegates, but failed in its fall session to increase their compensation, leading Bland to complain to Gov. Jefferson the following June that \""My Finances are as well as my Credit entirely exhausted. \"" See Madison, Papers (Hutchinson), 2:96n.4, 160n.1, 170n.10, 289n.8; and Jefferson, Papers (Boyd), 6:73.

  Dear Sir Philadelphia Novr. 6th 1780. I am honor'd by your Favor of the 3d for which be pleased to accept my Acknowledgments. We have various flying Reports of fortunate Events having taken Place in the South, & waited impatiently the Arrival of this Days Post, expecting it to bring Confirmation; but we are as yet without it, notwithstanding some have come in a pretty direct Line.

A Paragraph in a late N York Paper, complaining of the Perfidy of some Powers which (as they think), ought to be more attached to Britain, seems to give Strength to the above Observation.

  My dear Sir Philada Novr 7 1780 Your favor of the 21st of Septr (1) was deliverd to me by my very worthy Friend Arthur Lee who came to this City about a Fortnight ago. The Respect which you say was paid to him by the principal Gentlemen in Boston is exceedingly pleasing to me, because, from an intimate & confidential Correspondence with him for ten years, I am convincd that he was among the most early and consistent American Patriots. His inflexible Virtue in the first Stages of our Contest renderd him obnoxious to the great & powerful in England, and equally of late to interrested Persons in France & their Connexions in America. My Friendship for him is not private; it is grounded altogether on publick Principles. You tell me, his short Residence in the State of Massachusetts, has been very far from diminishing that Estimation in which the People held him there. I should have been indeed sorry if it had been otherwise; for his great Services to them in particular, had justly merited their Esteem. I rejoyce that my own Countrymen are not ungrateful. I hope they will always be too knowing and too just, either to pay servile Hommage to the weak and wicked, or to withhold the Marks of their Approbation due to the wise and good.  You have doubtless before this time been informd that Congress have called on the States to take immediate and effectual Measures to fill up the Army with their respective Quotas during the War. They have since orderd a Tax to the Value of Six Millions of Dollars in Specie, to be paid partly in specifick Articles for the Supply of the Army, and the Remainder in Gold & Silver or Bills of the new Emission.  Their Design is to have a permanent Army, and to provide adequate Magazines for its Subsistence without Delay. We have often a Choice of Difficulties presented to us. I think, upon the whole, we have in this Instance fixed upon the best Method. At least it appears to me to be the surest, considering all our Circumstances. And I am the more satisfied, because I understand that our Legislature have anticipated the Measure and already begun to assign the Towns for their respective Proportions of the specifick Articles. Had our Money been stable we might have contracted for the Supply of our Army; but the Paper, as all the World knows, is depreciated, for which we are in part obliged to our Enemies who are dexterous in counterfeiting.  Our Affairs in N Carolina wear a more agreable Aspect than they did a few Weeks ago. The Enemy, you have heard, are got into Chessapeak Bay. It is said they are landed at Portsmouth & Hampton & that they burn all before them. It is also said that the Militia  NOVEMBER 7, 1780  turned out with great Spirit, but we have had no official Letters by the last post.  Although we are pressd with Difficulties, we are in chearful Spirits and by the Blessing of Heaven expect to overcome them.

  Dear Sir Philada. Novr. 7th. 1780 Your favor of the 30 of last month came by yesterdays post, and explained a report which had amused us here for several days. It was said that some movements of the French to the Southward, had alarmed the enemy to such a degree that they had suddenly reembarked their troops and were leaving Virginia. The re-embarkation of the detachment which had taken possession of Hampton and its vicinity was no doubt the foundation of it. (1) Our curiosity is at present almost wholly directed to the Southward and I am happy in having so intelligent and punctual a correspondent so near the principal scene of military operations. NOVEMBER 7, 1780  There is I believe no doubt of an intended Congress at the Hague not of Ministers from the Belligerents but neutral powers under the auspices of Russia; and as the avowed object of it is to establish the liberty of the Seas which G. B has so little respected, and is highly approved by France & Spain as well as all the neutral Maritime powers, it must necessarily prove unfavorable to G. B. and consequently friendly to our views. Congress have thought it advisable to testify their approbation of the liberal principles held out by Russia as the basis of the proposed negociation, and have accordingly by a public Act adopted them so far as to direct the Board of Admiralty to prepare instructions for their Armed Vessels conformable to them.(2)  Doct. Lee and Mr. Izzard particularly the latter have been here some time, and I believe are not very reserved in their reflections on the venerable Philosopher at the Court of Versailles. Mr. Izzard I understand is particularly open in his charges against him. Doctr. Lee on his arrival applied to Congress for a hearing on the subject of Mr. Deanes allegations, if any doubt remained of the falsehood [and] malice of them, but nothing final has been done as yet in Consequence of it.(3) I have had great anxiety lest the flame of faction which on a former occasion proved so injurious should be kindled anew, but as far as I can judge the temper of Congress is in general by no means prone to it, -although there may be individuals on both sides who would both wish & endeavour it. Not a word has been heard of the Saratoga's prizes. A partial exchange of Prisoners we hear is agreed on, but have no official account of it.(4) Genls. Lincoln, Thomson, & du portail it is said are included in it, having been set against Philips & Reidezel. I have but few inferior officers named, except Col. Laurens.  A gentleman in Statia writes to the Commercial Committee of Octr. 3d that a Dutch war is seriously talked of at that place,(5) that the Dutch are certainly preparing a formidable marine, and that open protection & respect is now given to American Vessels in the same manner as to those of other Independent Nations. If this fact be truely represented, and it is mentioned with strong circumstances of credibility, it is probably one of the fruits of the neutral combinations set on foot by Russia.  Congress have just finished an estimate of supplies for the ensuing year requiring of the States the value of 6 Millions of Drs. in specie. The principal part of the requisition consists of specific articles, the residue specie or the new emissions, receivable as specie.(6) If the States fulfill this plan punctually there is no doubt that we can go smoothly through another Campaign and if they would forbear recurring to State emissions & certificates, in procuring the supplies, it may become a permanent & effectual mode of carrying on the war. But past experience will not permit our expectations to be very sanguine. The collection & transportation of specific supplies must necessarily   be tedious & subject to casualties, & the proceedings of 13 separate popular bodies, must add greatly to the uncertainty & delay. The expence attending the mode is of itself a sufficient objection to it if money could by any possible device be provided in due quantity. The want of this article is the source of all our public difficulties & misfortunes. One or two million of guineas properly applied would diffuse vigor and satisfaction throughout the whole military departments and would expel the enemy from every part of the United States. It would also have another good effect. It would reconcile the army & every body else to our republican forms of Governments; The principal inconveniences which are imputed to these being really the fruit of defective revenues. What other States effect by money, we are obliged to pursue by dilatory & undigested expedients, which benumb all our operations and expose our troops to numberless distresses. If these were well paid, well fed, and well cloathed, they would be well satisfied and would fight with more success. And this might & would be as well effected by our Governments as by any other if they possessed money enough as in our moneyless situation the same embarrassments would have been experienced by every government <<not excepting the most absolute.>  With very sincere regard I am Dr Sr. Yrs &ca.  J. Madison Junr.  ""

Agreed.  Agreed That a Resolution be Draughted for Calling in the old Bills & Supporting the Credit of the New. See The resolution by Mr Clark & Colo Bland on File. NOVEMBER 7, 1780  Proposition by Mr Sullivan for Draughting an address to the People to Induce them to Lend their Coin & Bullion & also an address to the respective Legeslatures requesting them to Encorage the Loan. Agreed.  <<Proposition by Mr Clark that the address be to the Legislatures of the States &R the Supply reced through them. Agreed.>  Proposition by Colo Bland that the Several Legislatures be Directed to call in their State Emissions & not Issue any more Bills of Credit but by advice of Congress. Agreed.  Question, by Mr. Sullivan whether is the money if obtained to be Deposited in the General Treasury or in a Bank. Agreed to a Bank.  Proposition by Mr. Sullivan, That The Manager of the Bank or  Strike & Sign a number of notes from a hundred pounds to an Eighth of a Dollar, a Quarter of which to be payable in one year, one Qr in two years another in 3 years & The Last Quarter in 4 years on Interest of Six per Cent Without Date. That the State Treasurers be Authorized To receive Coin & Bullion & Date & give out notes in Exchange.  Agreed, That Congress recommend to the Several States to pass Laws Enabling them to Lay Imposts on Importations for raising a revenue to Defray the Expence of the war & for paying the Debts of the united & States & to take Every possible measure for Encouraging Exportation.  That the State of Maryland be Called upon immediately to Accede to the Confederation and in Case of Neglect to Call upon the other twelve States to Confederate.  That the States be called upon Respectively to pass Laws Establishing Funds for Redemption of the Bills Emitted by virtue of the resolution of the 18th of March Last & also for Authorizing Congress to Lay Embargoes in time of War.  That a manager of the Bank be appointed by Congress.  That the Bank be Regulated in the following manner.(2) Agreed, That some Mode must be adopted to establish the Credit of Congress.  Agreed, by messrs Bland, Clark & Sullivan that this can only be done by calling in Buillion.  Said by Mr Matlock, this is not the only way; a Tax founded on Established Faith, will answer the same Purpose.  Questions  How can Bullion be called in and in what time?  How can a Tax founded on established Faith be made & Collected and in what time?  Mr Bland Proposes a Bank (or rather Several different Banks under the same Regulations)   That Subscriptions be immediately opened in the United States and a Letter Draughted addressed to the feelings of the People requesting them to bring in their Silver, gold and Copper coined & uncoined for establishing a Bank for Supporting the Credit of paper notes to be Issued thereon in the following Manner viz  Every man who will bring in ninety five Dollars shall be credited on the Books one hundred and Shall be entituled to receive an Interest of six per Cent in half yearly Payments which stock shall be Transferrable by Power or Letter of attorney.  That notes shall be issued from the Bank for nine tenths of the money received payable in 7 years without Interest to pass as a Circulating medium. The remaining Tenth is to be reserved for Drawing and redrawing.  That all the Plate shall be coined into pieces of particular Sorts as well as the Copper and the whole Deposited in the Bank as a Security for redemption of the Bills at the Days of payment.  That an annual Tax in Specie shall be Collected, Deposited in the Bank & appropriated as a sinking fund for paying the Interest due on Stocks received & for redemption of the notes issued.  That when the sum accumulated by Tax amounts to a certain given part of the sum in Stock (Say one half) notes are to be Exchanged for Specie at the Bank.  Questions by Mr. Matlack If the money is to be Deposited in Bank & nine tenths of it only to be represented by paper notes where is the advantage of keeping your money in Bank and representing it with paper?  Answer (3)  Question. If your Notes are Truly to represent Coin and to pass as such why shall the man who holds a note payable in 7 years & for which he has paid a valuable Consideration receive no Interest while he who Deposits money in the Bank draws an Interest of six per Cent-besides a Douceur-and will not tend to Depreciate the notes and Inhance the Prices of Articles?(3)  Question. Will not the publick Suffer a Loss by the coining of plate?(3)  Mr. Matlack In order to Show the Improbability of our Deriving any advantages from a Bank Consider the origin of Banks: he Says they originated among Gold Smiths whose real property, Respectable Characters added to their being in the visible Possession of Large Quantities of the precious Metals gave them an unlimited Credit.  He therefore Concludes that a Bank must be founded on a Credit already Established and Cannot in its nature be the means for Establishing a Credit in the first Instance-or for Restoring a Lost Confidence.  He Says that Congress have Lost their Credit & the first Steps must be to Re-establish it which if Done will answer Every purpose & Even make paper Bills answer us Every purpose of Gold & Silver. To prove which he mentions an Emission of paper in Pensylvania Issued by an assembly in whom the People had the most unlimited Confidence founded on Land Security which passed as Specie though it Drew an Interest of Six per Cent for the use of the State.  He allows that Congress have not Either this Confidence or the property to Pledge for redemption of their Bills.  Therefore recommends an immediate ratification of the association with an Additional Clause oblidging the States to pass Laws for funding the Bills Emitted by Congress not to be repealed But by Consent or Direction of Congress, to this Mr Bland agrees.  He then Shows that in young Countries where the Increasing wealth appears by additional Cultivation only must have a Ballance against them which will Draw off their Specie to other & older nations with whom they have Commercial Connections whose wealth cannot appe[a]r by additional Culture of Lands but by Specie in possession.  To Turn this Ballance of Trade in our favor he Deems Essential & proposes Every Encouragement to Exportation & Large Duties on the importation of all the Luxuries of Life. He also Recommends Sumptuary Laws but allows them to be attended with many Difficulties in the Execution.  Mr Matthews agrees with Mr Matlack on the Necessity of Sumptuary Laws.  Mr Clark agrees with Mr Matlack on the addition to the Confederation & proposes that Congress Shall in addition have the Absolute Controul of all the Ports in America.  Mr Sullivan Suppose that the obstruction of our Commerce by the war has not only prevented our paying in Specie The Debt due from America to Britain but has Layd us under a necessity of relying more on the manufactures of our own Country & prevented in great measure the Consumption of those Luxuries with which we once abounded, & for which Large Sums of money were drawn from this Continent.  That the obstructions of the Custom House Channel which Drew immense Treasures from America & the variety of Channels opened by the French & British Army for Supplying the Farmers & others with Specie must prove that there is a much greater Quantity of the precious metals in America than at the Commencement of the War: That the reason why this Specie does not appear is because the Introduction of a fluctuating paper Currency Daily Deprec[i]ating in value operated as a probihition To The holders of Specie to Throw it into Circulation Especially as Tender Acts were attempted in almost Every state & proved exceedingly injurious to those who had ventured   their hard money into Circulation. But Should he be mistaken in this Conjecture he says it will not be denied that The Coin and Plate in America will amount to a Large Sum in value & that this if procured will be of great advantage to these States-provided Specie can be introduced as an auxilary to the Bills Emitted on the 18th of March without proving injurious or Destructive to them.  He therefore proposes the following Plan, viz.  That an address be sent to the Several states to be communicated to the People informing them of the true state of our Finances and the situation of our Publick affairs & requesting them to Furnish to the Publick Treasury Through the Treasurers of the respective states all Coined Silver & gold & all Plate which they can possibly be induced to part with and with this requisition to Send the plan for repayment that they may be assured of payment in Specie with the Annual Interest.  He Says that as the Circumstances of this Country will not admit of Establishing a Bank on the Principles of that of England or Amsterdam he Chuses to Consider the whole as a Transaction between Congress, The Continental Treasurer and Individuals-& Conducted in the following manner viz.  That Notes be given by the Treasurer to Each person for the Sum he shall furnish in four Equal Annual payments with Interest of six per Cent. That the plate & Copper be Coined & Deposited in the Treasury for payment of the notes with the Interest as they may become Due.  That Congress in no Case Draw more than half the Specie out of the Treasury & not This till They have previously forwarded to the States an Estimate with a Requisition of a Tax in Specie for the money so Drawn out with a years Interest of the whole Sum which is to be Deposited there for the purposes aforesaid.  That there be Annually an Estimate of the Expenditures of the Ensuing year & Collected one half in the New Bills & the other half in Specie in Case the Specie will amount to a Sufficiency to pay The Sum Drawn from the Treasury with the Interest of the Sum in Bank & if not: then the Specie Tax is to be augmented to make that Sum & the paper Tax Diminished and for all the Surplus (if any should be) the Treasurer may Issue his notes payable in one year in Specie first Deducting a years Interest That there may be no failure of payment or Defect of Credit.  That in all payments Bills of the 18th of March be Considered as Specie & received as Such & an allowance made for the Interest Due thereon, but that no person Shall be Compelled to receive more than half his Demand in those Bills the other half is to be made in Specie & Every Tax is to be paid Equally in Specie & paper Except as Shall be found necessary to augment the Specie for the Reasons aforesaid.  That all notes be redeemable on Sight at the Treasury after the Time of payment is Elapsed with the Interest Due at the time they are presented-and that the Interest on all notes be paid annually if requested.  That in receiving paper Bills of the aforesd. Emission by the respective Collectors of Taxes the Interest due thereon be allowed up to the time of their being received And that Congress may if they find it necessary re-Issue Such Bills for Defraying the publick Expences or may hold them out of Circulation if they think proper.  That for a present Supply of Specie all the Continental vessels of war and all the Publick Stables & the Barracks at Cambridge & all Naval Stores be Sold for Specie & Deposited in the Treasury Subject to the order of Congress to be Drawn out in Specie or by notes without Interest payable in one year & in Case notes are Issued thereon Congress may Draw one half the Specie so Deposited by them, provided they first make a requsition for a Tax in specie for the amount so Drawn with the Interest of the whole payable in one year.  This will not be Liable to the objections made to Mr Blands Plan, Because Congress will Ever have it in their power after the whole sum is Deposited to obtain the Loan of one half in Specie for a year & of Course one third more money is represented than is really in Stock without Injury or Danger to the Lender as to the Residue remaining inactive in Bank while we are paying Interest for it two answers can be given 1st that we never need pay Interest for more than two thirds of what is really in Circulation, & that the money kept out of Circulation Serves to uphold our Credit & by remaining out of Circulation will Lower the prices of Articles & in the natural Course of Commerce Draw money from other nations to fill up the vacuum & Introduce that Level of money which must take place among all Commercial Nations.  2dly that Should the money itself be Thrown into Circulation you can only have two thirds as much in Circulation as upon the Plan proposed and This Instead of revolving round the Bank as a Centre will fly to those nations with whom we have Commercial Connections under the Disadvantages of a Ballance of trade against us-which would soon Leave us in as great want of Specie as at present-for which reason I recommend all foreign Loans that may be obtained to be Deposited in the Treasury under the foregoing regulations.  The 2d objection to Mr Blands proposal can have no force against this plan.  He recommends that all Treasurers Notes of which the time for payment is Elapsed be received by the Collectors in Lieu of Specie allowing Interest thereon, up to the Day of payment provided they be paid in one month after the Collectors warrants are Signed but in no Case to allow more than a months Interest after the Date of Such warrant.   He also Recommends that Every Person Interested in the Bills may have Liberty to Examine the Treasury & Inspect the Books to Satisfy himself of the State of it & the Treasurer is to Show him the Draughts of Congress & their requsition for a Tax in Specie to replace what may have been Drawn out.  Upon This Plan Let us Suppose two Millions to be Collected on the first Day of May 1781 notes being Issued payable to the Bearer with Interest the whole will be represented by notes Congress then Draw out a Million in Specie & put it in Circulation. There will then be Three millions in Circulation, when in fact only two millions have been received & Congress only pay Interest for Two millions.  To This it may be objected that Congress only have the Disposal of one million & asked why it would not be best for Congress to put the Two millions of Specie in Circulation at once? To this he answers that though this objection might have weight between Individuals yet it cannot have the Same force in a State. The Business of Congress is to provide & Support a proper Circulating medium for the State out of which they have a right to Demand from the States as much as will answer to Defray the publick Expences & where there is not a Sufficiency of money to answer the Demands of the State Increasing it by representation on payment founded on a fixed & Certain plan for paper is Essentially necessary, besides if you were to throw the whole into Circulation the Specie would Soon make its way to nations with whom we are Connected & which hold the Ballance of Trade against us. But on the present plan the Bank will be the vortex for Drawing all the money from persons who wish to Live on the Interest of their money & will Serve as a Centre to attract the notes & hold the Specie from flying to Distant Nations.  But another objection may be raised viz what Security will Individuals have for the repayment of their money.  Answer, one half will Ever be in Stock which will be Sufficient for two years payment & if we Suppose that in two years the States will not or cannot furnish the Sums Drawn out we must have no faith in the virtue of the people or prospect of Supporting the war. To Illustrate this I will Suppose that Congress Sell their Armed vessels &c. for two million Sterling but this is not Sufficient by one million to Defray the Expence of the war for the year-& cannot hire sums for the purpose. What is to be Done? Why upon the foregoing plan the whole is to be Lodged in Bank & notes Issued & then a Million Drawn out in Specie This will put three million into Circulation & by Loosing the Interest of the million in Bank the Credit of your Bills is Supported while the Hoarding up that million Serves to Lessen the prices of Articles & Consequently will if your paper is not too much Increased attract Specie from the neighbouring nations to fill the vacuum which this makes for However Paradoxical it may appear  the only way to bring Large Quantities of Specie into a State is to hoard up Large Treasures.(4)  If common Reason and the Observation of Mankind did not evince the Truth of this Proposition the Reasoning of Mr. Hume on the Subject must convince every unprejudiced Mind. He after treating the Idea of the Balance of Trade as rather Chimerical says,  \""Suppose the four fifths of the Money in Britain to be annihilated in one Night, and the Nation reduced to the Condition, with reguard to Specie as in the Reigns of the Harrys and Edwards what would be the consequence! Must not the Price of all Labor and Commodities sink in Proportion and every Thing be sold as cheap as they were in those Ages? What Nation then could dispute with Us in any Foreign Market or pretend to Navigate or to sell Manufactures at the same Price which to us would afford sufficient Profit? In little Time therefore must this bring back the Money which we had lost and raise Us to the level of all the Neighbouring Nations? Where after We have Arriv'd We immediately lose the Advantage of the Cheapness of Labor and Commodities; & the farther flowing-in of Money is stoped by Our fullness and Repletion.  \""The only expedient by which We can raise Money above its proper level is the gathering up of large Sums into a Publick Treasury locking them up and absolutely preventing their Circulation, this Fluid not communicating with the Neighbouring Elements may by such an Artifice be raised to what height We please the immediate Consequence of such an Event would be the attraction of an Equal Sum from all the Neighbouring Nations.  \""So little are we commonly acquainted with this Principle that tho all Historians agree in relating uniformily so recent an Event as the immense Treasure Amassd by Harry the seventh which they make amount to £1,700,000 wt of Silver.(5) We rather reject their concurring Testimony that admit of a fact which agrees so ill with our inveterate Prejudices.  \""Tis indeed probable that Sum might be three fourths of all the Money in England.(6)  \""But where is the Difficulty that Such a Sum might be amassed in twenty Years by a cunning, rapacious, Frugal and almost Arbitrary Monarch?

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia Novr. 9th. 1780 I do my self the honour to write your Excellency by the express that goes to Carry the recommendation to the several States for levying a Tax equal in value to Six Million of Silver dollars to be paid as is therin recommended, (1) Upon which I beg liberty to observe that the provisions is called for upon the most accurate calculation the Nature of the business would admit and upon the most mature deliberation. Congress were unanimous of opinion that a lesser quantity could not be relyed on with safety.. The Tax is proportioned both as to the Supplies and money agreable to the proportion on which the first fifteen Million Monthly Tax was recommended. Great care hath been taken that the states be called on for such kind of provision as each state could best Supply. It is probable there may be some disproportion in the prices of the several Articles which is intended to be remedyed by a resolution reserving the whole for a liquidation at a future day. The consideration of this business took up much of the time & attention of Congress and they were fully sensible of the burdens their Constituents groaned under at the same time found themselves under the absolute necessity of making the recommendation. They could devise no alternative. I hope our state will adopt the recommendation and find their resources adequate to the requisition.  Much is said upon the subject of an Armed Neutrality and some politicians Conjecture it strongly forebodes a general peace. I confess I am not sanguine in my expectations on the subject And can assure you Sr. Congress have not received the most distant official hint that a peace is even conjectured by those Neutral powers.  I inclose to your Excellency a Coppy of my letter of the 10th Ultimo that fell into the hands of the Enemy Since Mr. Rivington hath been so kind as to publish it.(2) His motives for so doing I am at a loss to gess, but I must do him that Justice as to say he hath given the publick an Accurate Coppy. General Greene left this City on Saturday last on his way to joyn the Southern Army as did also the Baron Stuben. We have had no news from the Southard for a considerable time- it is generally beleived the Enemy have reimbarked their Troops at Virginia tho Congress have no official account. Where they are gone is not known but it is probable further southard, A letter from Genl. Washington was read in Congress yesterday informing that an embarcation was taking place in NYork supposed to reinforce their Armies to the Southard.(3) Congress have receivd no official letters from abroad for several week past, And I have no further Intelegence worth your Notice.  I have the honour to be your Excellencys most obedt Huml  Servant, Ezek Cornell NOVEMBER 9, 1780  NB. I apprehend you have not seen the araingment of the Army Mentioned in the Inclosed Coppy as they fell into the hands of the Enemy at the same time My letter did (4) But as the araingment was after wards altered and sent forward which I trust you have receivd it is not so matireal. I shall be more cautious in future in writing as you can easily Judge of my feeling if some of my letters you have receivd had met the fate the one did of which the inclosed is a Coppy. E.C .  ""

And that the commanders in Chief are about to negociate a general exchange, including the convention troops and our Militia. Genl. Washington is instructed to endeavour to obtain a condition, that, the convention and other british prisoners shall not take the field nor bear Arms before the first of May.(3)  However humanity dictated an immediate exchange, yet our present critical situation to the southward made it a great question in policy; was the exchange to take place immediately and the enemy at Liberty to Arm and send forth their liberated troops it might be a fatal stroke to the State of No. Carolina; because in that State we have not Arms, Stores &c at present to put into the hands of Our liberated troops & Militia in order to make a vigorous defence, therefore the Delegates of No. Carolina have been the means of keeping back the exchange a few weeks past and of quallifying the measure as above mentioned,(4) with a view to get Genl. Greene in command, get forward some Arms, Stores &c-and get time to draw out and organize a little Army, that may promise us some defence, all which I hope will sufficiently justify our conduct to our brave and virtuous Officers and Soldiers who are in a distressing captivity. We have been so opposed in this business of delaying the exchange, by some of our neighbouring Delegates, who has a passionate fondness for their friends, that we have been threatned with the displeasure of those in captivity. These things have but little effect on the minds of men determined to do what appears to be right. We are so well assured of the patriotism of Our Officers & Soldiers, that they would at the risk of their lives endure six months or perhaps twenty months longer confinement rather than obtain liberty at the risque of a whole State.

  Sir, Duplicate Circular. Philadelphia November 10. 1780  Your Excellency will receive herewith inclosed, an Act of Congress of the 21 Ulto, containing a new Arrangement of the Army; special reasons have delayed the sending of it forward to the several States until this Time.(1) By this Arrangement the Number of Battallions is greatly reduced, & of Consequence many of the Officers now retained in the Service must retire for the present; but after just & equitable Compensation is made to them the Saving of Expence will be very great.  Congress are extremely anxious, not only to avoid the Dangers & Embarrassments heretofore experienced by Delays in recruiting the Army until the Opening of the Campaign, but also to establish a permanent Army, of Troops engaged for the War to consist of such Numbers as may be adequate to the Service, and at the same Time not exceed the Ability of the States to raise & support, and constantly recruit so as to keep up the number.  It is recommended to the States in the most pressing Manner to have their regiments completed & in the Field by the first Day of January next at farthest. The Commander in Chief will cause immediate returns to be made of the Deficiencies of each State according to this Arrangement.  You will observe Sir that the respective States are to select from the Line of the Army the Number of Officers to command the several regiments to them respectively assigned, taking Notice that no new Appointment is to be made, of higher rank than Lt Colonel Commandant, for substantial reasons supposed to be known to all the States.  But the first & immediate Object is to complete the regiments to their full Number of noncommisioned Officers & Privates, which is recommended in the most pressing Manner as of the greatest Importance .

  Dear Sir Philad. November 10. 1780. I received your favor of the 10th of October, since which nothing very material has occurred.  The Delegates for the State of No. Carolina, from the hour of my Arrival at this place have been endeavouring to obtain arms & Military Stores for the Southern Department, but with very little Effect. Five or six hundred Tents, and about as many muskets are at length prepared, and left (to be forwarded) in Care of Colo. Phebecker by Order of Genl. Green, who, together with Baron Stuben, set out for No. Carolina five or six Days ago. Colo. Lees Corps marched two Days past from this place for the Southward.  We are informed by Genl. Washington that another Embarkation is going on at New York, supposed to be destined for the Southward. I think the Enemy will push hard this Winter for the Conquest, or at least for the possession of No. Carolina, for which Reason it will be good policy to make the utmost possible Exertions, let the Expence attending them, or the Duty in the Field fall ever so hard upon our Constituents. There are many Reasons to justify such Measures, too obvious to need repeating to you; but I will mention a single one; a powerful armed Neutrality is about to hold a Congress in Europe, and how far their Views may extend is unknown; possibly they may dictate a peace to the Belligerent powers, and, if so, it is to be dreaded that an Uti possidetis will be one of the articles. The Idea of taking New York (the favourite child of Congress and of Genl. Washington for two years past) may possibly prove the Ruin of the Southern States.  With the most sincere Regard for you and your family I remain, Dear Sir, Your most obedt. Servt. Willie Jones  ""

Some Accident prevented the Arrival of the Eastern Post last Monday and he is now not expected till the next. I hope I shall then receive a Line from you, to let me know at least that you are well. If you do not acknowledge the Receipt of my Letter of the 10th of October,(1) I shall conclude that it fell into wrong hands; for the Post that took Charge of the Letters from hence of that Date, was robbd of his Mail in Connecticut and it was carried to New York. I am uncertain NOVEMBER 11, 1780  whether I sent that Letter to the Post office, or deliverd it to Mr Torry who left this City about the same time. If the Enemy have filchd it, their publishing it will do no good to them nor Injury to me or any one else. Indeed it was an harmless thing, and worth no ones Notice but yours, and yours, only as it was intended to inform you that I was then, as I am at this time, in good Health. I flatter my self you are always gratified when I can give you this Intelligence.  Nove 13th.

I have been anxious lest our Countrymen should misjudge in the Choice of their first Governor.(2) They are grateful; and I was affraid that from the goodness of their Hearts they might be induced to give their Suffrages for a Man, who, they might conceive, had done them eminent Services, in other Stations, without a due Consideration whether he possesses those excellent Qualities which should characterize and dignify their cheife Magistrate. Our present Governors may probably stamp the moral as well as political Character of the People.

But why do I trouble you with a Subject of this Nature? Let me ask you before I finish this Letter-Are you in health?

The Barbarities committed on our frontiers are as disgraceful to the Britons as they are injurious to us. The time may come when they may be severely retaliated; & they will have Reason to repent of their Cruelty. I feel much for my poor fellow Citizens who daily fall the Victims of such implacable Malice and Vengeance.  I find with singular Satisfaction, that our dear Harry has not only escaped from imminent danger, but acquired Reputation.(1) Before he was attacked he wrote me that he had grown fond of a military Life. I suppose he will soon favour me with a Line.  Brother John , I presume , returnd with the Governour. I requested the favour of him to assist in disposing of my Horses, the price he is the best Judge of & his opinion shall govern mine. Be so good as to tell him so.  Hughey (2) is remiss in not writing to me, or at least giving you his Account. Mr. McDougald (3) has deceived us both in withholding the Amount of the order he accepted in Hughey's favour. It is for that Reason probably that he applies the other money receivd by him, to discharge the order. I do not blame him for it; but he ought to have informed us for his own sake; as well as to give me an opportunity of checking McDougald; especially as we may want the money. I am ready enough to make all proper allowances. The Distresses on the frontiers, I foresaw must have prevented Business in our Township. The twenty pounds he paid you is, I conclude, for a year's Rent of the Mill farm; & paid by young Westly.  The Governour has, I find, given you Expectations of my Return for want of sufficient Supplies. I shall endeavour, in any Event, to pay you a Visit in the Course of the winter, and suppose I shall be relievd by Col. Floyd & Mr. L'hommedieu (or General McDougald), as they have long been absent from Congress.

A considerable time has now elapsed, and Mr. Morris remaining in a disagreable state of suspence, I cannot forbear to entreat your farther attention to his case.(1) Congress, in the former part of the present year, referred an application from the same State, to the Commander in chief. It was respecting Samuel Elbert, esquire, Colonel and principal Officer in the line of the State, and Brigadier-general of the militia, who being a prisoner of war, the Government was very solicitous to procure his exchange.(2) Should you have done any thing in consequence of this reference; Should be happy in having it in my power to make the communication.  Major-general Lincoln, during his command of the Southern Army, made a proposition to Major-general Prevost, to exchange Elbert for Governor Wright: but the latter objecting that he ought to be considered as a prisoner, it was referred to the decision of Sir Henry Clinton. General Lincoln can advise particularly respecting this business and I rely upon your Excellency's moving in it to a proper length.(3)  Mr. & Mrs. Matthews inform me that an application is about to be made to Sir Henry Clinton, thro your Excellency, for permission for the latter to go in a flag to Charles-town; and Mrs. Walton's Sister, (who is now with us,) having an Estate of Negroes in Georgia; Seems inclined to embrace so good an opportunity of going there. I request, therefore, that you will apply also for leave for Miss Ann Sarah Camber, to go to Savannah in Georgia, by way of Charlestown in South-Carolina.(4)  As it will be her wish to return to her sister, by this or some other flag, I leave it to your Excellency to determine, whether it is necessary to mention such intention-or whether it may not be left open, and for her to depend upon a passport to return from the Commanding Officer there? If there could be no doubt of Sir Henry's agreeing to give a permission to return at leisure, I could wish it asked for, altho it might encrease the difficulty of getting her negroes. Miss Camber is hopeful of returning this winter; but I think it improbable.  NOVEMBER 12, 1780  I have the honor to be, with great respect, your Excellency's most Obedient servant, Geo Walton  ""

By the Act of the 7th (a Copy of which will be forwarded to Genl Greene) your Excellency is authorized to effect an Exchange of all Continental Prisoners of War & now in Possession of the Enemy, and of the Hostages given in Canada; all Officers on Parole & Officers Violators of Parole, & Militia actually taken in Arms & remaining Prisoners of War, for an equal Number of Prisoners in our Hands, including the Convention Troops if an Exchange can be affected upon the Terms mentioned in the Act.(2)  It is needless to remark to your Excellency how exceedingly the Individuals of our Troops in Captivity feel themselves injured, if they are not exchanged in the Order of their Captivity; as I take it to be a rule you have ever adhered to, when not inadmissible from peculiar circumstances, which have caused a Deviation therefrom in some particular Cases.  The Act of the 9th will inform your Excellency that the Hospital Chaplains are discontinued, & Brigade Chaplains from Time to Time are to attend the established Hospitals.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia Novr. 13th 1780 The enclosed I lately received, (1) & beg Leave to lay it before you. Genl Washington writes that another Embarkation is about to take Place at New York, destined southward-that Rodney is to sail for the West Indies as soon as the Cork Fleet arrives. It seems to be the Plan of the Enemy to push the War in the South, in Hope of making more considerable Impressions in that Quarter, it being supposed by them the weaker, than they can in any other. Yet I trust our late Successes in Carolina will in some Measure defeat & frustrate their Intentions. I have for some Time past endeavoured to sell a Bill on Maryland, but cannot find a Purchaser, therefore fear we must put you to the Trouble of forwarding by Post or otherways the Money for our Support, of which we stand in great Need.(2) Mrs. Plater offers her Respects to your Lady, & I am with the greatest Regard & Strongest Attachments, Yr Excellency's most obt.& obliged Servt., Geo Plater  ""

  Dear Sir, Publick, Philadelphia 14th November 1780 I have the Honour of both your Excellency's dispatches of the 29th October, accompanied by several Resolutions of the honourable Legislatures;(1) to all which I shall pay the strictest Attention.  The Desolation of so great a part of our Northern and Western Frontiers is deeply to be deplored: but when a powerful nation will descend to the low Employment of an Incendiary; and plume herself NOVEMBER 13, 1780  on wasting a Country which she cannot subdue: when she can sacrifice her Glory to her Vengeance; and trample upon the Laws of War; the Rights of Humanity; and the Obligations of Honour and Justice; merely to ruin and distress!  When her military are taught to destroy without Distinction of Remorse; and to fly without Shame! Is it to be wondered at that she shoud be succesful in Feats not beyond the Atchievement of the midnight Ruffian!  The Time may come when such unexampelled Cruelty shall draw down Just Retaliation, and she shall feel the sad Effects of an Example which fills the World with Abhorrence!  Your Excellency's Remarks respecting the Grants are but too well founded: But to press for a Decision woud hitherto have been highly impolitic. Those who are convinced of the Justice of our Cause wish it to yield to the pressure of our publick Affairs; and that we shoud give no Room for complaint that we embarrass the national Councils with a partial Concern, while the Preservation of the common Liberties demands all our Efforts for a vigorous and decisive Campaign. When this great business is dispatched, I shall recall the Attention of Congress to our Cause and do my utmost to bring it to a happy Issue. The Motives which Have additional weight to reconcile us to Passivity the General, (2) who is the Bearer of these dispatches, will communicate. The Legislature, in their late Appointment of Delegates, have distinguishd me by a fresh proof of their Confidence, and I shall not fail to give the best Evidence, which uprightness and Assiduity can produce, of my Zeal and Attachment to the common Interest, and of my constant Attention to the Rights and the Security of the State which I so long have had the Honour to represent.  The honourable Legislature will observe that by the Reduction of the five State Regiments to three, agreeably to the new Arrangement of the Army, their Instruction in the Joint Resolution of both Houses of the 7th of October is anticipated.(3) The Objections which are raised in their Resolutions of the same day on the Acts of Congress directing a Compensation for the Army, deserve great Consideration. The Subject, as your Excellency must perceive, is involved in great difficulties, and it will be hard to lay down a Rule for defining what Troops, not of the respective Lines, shall be provided for, by each State; so as to do equal Justice to All. It will however be attempted, and is now under Commitment. The mistakes of the Board of War in assigning to our Quota Officers and Privates who are known to have been Natives And Residents of other States, can readily be corrected.  The Joint Resolutions of our Legislature on the Act of Congress of the 26th of August for ascertaining the Current Value of Continental Bills of Credit, compared with Specie at the time the   debt became due &c is also under the Consideration of a Committee: and I have no doubt but the Mode of Adjustment suggested by the Legislature will meet with Approbation: It affords full Security to the publick, and the Creditor, and nothing further can be desired.(4) The last Resolutions of the Legislature investing full power in Congress for an effectual prosecution of the War, does Honour to their Zeal and publick Spirit; it shall be communicated and enforced. The Compulsory Clause is not perhaps proper for publick Inspection;(5) as it implies most Strongly and will certainly hazard what General Scott will better explain in a verbal Conference. On this point I shall wait for further Instructions; observing however that I shall not, In Case of Necessity fail, to pursue the Spirit of the whole Resolution; tho' at present we both are struck with the Impolicy of producing the Clause alluded to. We hope to be pardoned for exercising our Discretion so far as to represent Inconveniencies which we apprehend, before an Instruction is publickly announced; especially as we cannot foresee that a Short Suspension will be attended with any pernicious Consequences General Scott will fully apprize your Excellency of the State of our publick Affairs; and of the preparations for a vigorous Campaign; and the necessity of all our Efforts to expell the Enemy by a Combination of the Strength and Resources of the several States. The Estimates for the ensuing year are large, and the Demands upon each State burthensome. They are not, however, conceived beyond their Abilities: while The Object is of the utmost Importance. A respectable, well appointed, well supported Army, with the Cooperation of our Allies will, under the Divine Blessing, put an Period to the Expences and the Calamities of War, and fix the Liberties of our Country on a permanent Basis: while scanty and precarious Supplies of Men and Provisions, must continue to render every Enterprize Abortive, and to involve us in Ruin and Disgrace.  I entreat your Excellency to assure the honourable Legislature of my respectful Attachment, and my Strenuous Exertions to discharge with Fidelity and Success the Trust which they have been pleased to repose in me: And that you will believe me to be-with the utmost Regard & Esteem-Dear Sir, your Excellency's most Obedient and very humble Servant, Jas.

  Dear Sir, Philada. Novr. 14th. 1780 I am glad to find by your favor of the 5th inst.(1) recd. yesterday that your health & that of your family have admitted of your going to Richmond. The tardiness of other members is very unfortunate and inexcusable at the present critical moment. I wish when they do meet the vigor & wisdom of their measures may make amends for it.  I do not learn that any of the States are particularly attentive to prevent the evils arising from certificates & emissions from their own treasury, although they are unquestionably the bane of every salutary arrangement of the public finances. When the Estimate for the ensuing year was on the anvil in Congress, I proposed a recommendation to the States to discontinue the use of them, & particularly in providing the specific articles required.(2) It met however with so cool a reception that I did not much urge it. The objection against it was that the practice was manifestly repugnant to the Spirit of the Acts of Congress respecting finance, and if these were disregarded, no effect could be expected from any additional recommendations. The letters from G. Washington & the Com: General for some time past give a most alarming picture of the state & prospects of the Magazines. Applications to the contiguous States on the subject have been repeated from every quarter, till they seem to have lost all their force. Whether any degree of danger & necessity will rouse them to provide for the winter season now hastening upon  NOVEMBER 14, 1780  us, I am unwilling to decide because my fears dictate the worst. The inroads of the Enemy on the frontier of N. York have been most fatal to us in this respect. They have almost totally ruined that fine Wheat Country, which was able and from the energy of their Govt. most likely, to supply Magazines of flour both for the main Army & the NW posts. The Settlemt. of Schoarie which alone was able to furnish, accordg to a letter from Genl Washington 80,000 bushels of grain for public use has been totally laid in ashes.  Genl Washington in a letter to Congress of the 4th inst: mentions that another embarkation was on foot at N. York. In another of the 7 he says he had received no further intelligence on the subject, but had reason to think such a measure was still in contemplation. From the last letter it appears that by the late exchange abt. 140 officers including Genls. Lincoln, Thomson, Waterbury & du portail & Col. Laurens are liberated, as also all our privates amounting to 476. The General had acceded to a further proposal of Clinton for exchanging almost the whole residue of Our Officers for Convention Officers with out attaching any privates to them.  Reports of the 2d division of the French fleet are again reviving as you will see by the inclosed paper. It is also said that Rodney has sailed from N. York with 10 Ships of the line for Europe, but if there be any reality in the first report, it is more likely he is gone out to meet the french. The Cork fleet is not yet arrived, and very serious apprehensions begin to prevail at N. Y. on account of it.  Mr. Walker has been detained since the expiration of his service by an indisposition. He will set out in two or three days.(3) Col. Pendleton informs me that Mr. Henry has resigned his place in Congress and intimates his fears that you may follow his example. I hope he is mistaken in the first as I am assured by your requ[est?] concerning Pemberton that he must be in the last. If Mr. Henry however should have resigned I intreat you to see that the vacancy is judiciously filled; and if any thoughts of it have been indulged by your self, I intreat you still more strongly to dismiss them. I have not yet received an answer from Pemberton, and have not had time since yours came in hand to apply for it.(4) I was unwilling to appear very anxious about the matter. You shall know what is to be expected from him by next Post. I make no apology for inaccuracies & bad writing because you know the manner in which we are obliged to write for the post, and having been prevented by Company from doing any thing last night I am particularly hurried this morning.

  Dr. Sir Philada. Novr. 14th. 1780 Yr. favor of the 6th inst:(1) came to land yesterday. Mr. Griffin (2) by whom you appear also to have written has not yet arrived.  It gives me great pleasure to find that the Enemy's numbers are so much less formidable that [than] was at first computed, but the information from N. York makes it not improbable that the blank in the computation may shortly be filled up. Genl. Washington wrote to Congress of the 4th inst. that another embarkation was going on at that place, and in another letter of the 7th he says that although he had received no further intelligence on the Subject, he had reason still to believe that such a measure was in contemplation. Neither the amount nor the object of it however had been ascertained.  The inroads of the Enemy on the Frontiers of N. York have been distressing & wasteful almost beyond their own example. They have totally laid in ashes a fine settlement called Schoarie which was capable Gel Washington says of yielding no less than 80,000 bushels of grain for public consumption. Such a loss is inestimable, and is the more to be regretted because, both local circumstances, and the energy of that Govt. left little doubt that it would have been applied to public use.  I fancy the taking of Quebec was a mere invention. Your letter gave me first account of such a report. A different report concerning the 2d. division of the French fleet has sprung up as you will see by the inclosed paper. It is believed here by many, and some attention given to it by all. It is also said that Rodney has saild from N. York with 10 Ships for Europe. If he has sailed at all & the first report be true also, it is more likely that he is gone out to meet the french.  The late exchange has liberated abt. 140 Officers & all our privates at N. Y. amounting to 476. G. Washington has acceded to a proposal of a further example of the Convention Officers without attaching any privates to them, which will liberate almost the whole residue of our Officers at that place.  NOVEMBER 15, 1780  I am Sir with the highest esteem & regard, Yr obt. friend & Servt. J . Madison Junr.  ""

  Dear sir, Philadelphia Nov. 15th 1780  The painting of your Carriage is not yet quite finished. Would recommend your Sending the Ballance of the money as soon as possible. Should the Carriage be finished before the money is ready a pretence may be made for raising the Exchange now between 80 & 90.  The House of Delegates I am informed have Come into a resolution of Calling in the old Continental money at forty for one. Their views I suppose extend no further than to Call in as much of the old as will put into Circulation Our part of the Continental new Emission on which, And the Support of its Credit, much depends. I am afraid that the want of unanimity in that House, will much embarrass their proceedings, but hope the Sordid Interest and private views of Individuals will not be Suffered to prevail So far as to defeat measures Calculated for the public good. It ought to be Considered that our All is at Stake and that every exertion is necessary for our Safety. The Army is again in great want of provisions, and unless Sufficient Supplies are Sent forward before the hard weather Sets in, they must be in great distress.  The Cork provision fleet so long looked for at New York is not yet Arrived-the embarkation of Troops at that place is Still going on, destined it is probable to reinforce their Army in Virginia.- For Southern news I refer you to the last paper.  My finances are very low And Shall in a very little time be in disagreeable Situation.

  Dear Sir Schulkill Falls November 15th 1780.(1) Some time has Elapsed, since I wrote You last owing to my having been ill, with the Fever which raged in the City. I was not confind more than a Week, yet it left me so Enfeebled that an attention to the Business in Congress; and on Committees which met every Morning and Evening not only prevented my Writing but reduced me so low that I was compell'd to move to this Place for recovery of Health from which I ride into the City every Morning to meet Committees at Nine, attend Congress afterwards; and return at Night, this Deprives me of that Leisure which I would wish to Employ in giving You every possible Information respecting our Publick Affairs. I am sorry to say that they are far from affording Pleasure to the Friends of America; former Congresses undoubtly had their Difficulties; and whether any other set of Men under their Circumstances would have done better is not Easy for a Judicious Mind to Determine. Events have however proved their Error and call aloud for a speedy reformation. Perhaps most of our Difficulties have arisen from an Ignorance of Finance, & the want of System in every Department.  A new Army is now Arrainged the States now called upon for Men and Specific Supplies. All Publick Departments are now Arranging upon oeconomical Principles. The several and expensive Navy Boards will be Abolished. The War Office and Treasury Board regulated. A Committee is appointed for arranging our Finances. A Loan from France solicited in the most pressing and Positive Terms: and a regular System will soon take Place. Perhaps it may be thought a late Hour for this reformation, but is it not better late than never? Every Days Experience proves that many of our Distresses arise from a want of Power in Congress to carry any of their Measures into Execution. They send Requisitions to the States, some comply, some do not; and the Consequence of this is too Obvious to need Explanation. Hence it is that our Army is often ready to Perish with Hunger and Cold. I am happy to find that New Hampshire stands formost in Her Compliance with the requisitions of Congress. At present we have no Money in the Treasury, some States have not yet receiv'd their new Money or call'd in their Old. This with the Artful Industry of Tories, and Speculators has Depreciated the Old Money to Eighty five and even to a Hundred and ten for one in this City. This of course more than doubles our National Debt; for as the Bills of the 18th of March must be redeemed with Silver and Gold, and are Issued at forty for one Five Million of Silver Dollars must be employed to redeem the two Hundred Million of Dollars Emitted: When at only Eighty for one two Millions and a half of  NOVEMBER 15, 1780  Silver Dollars would purchase in the whole Sum. Consequently there is a National loss of more than two Millions and a half of Silver Dollars with its Interest without any Prospect of Publick Advantage. But this is not all. Speculators, and Tories, who have hoarded up the Specie take every advantage of our Necessities, Speculate upon our Foreign Bills so that we loose 25 per Cent on all our Money borrowed from France. Our Army is almost Naked yet we have had Clothing sufficient for them at Cape Francois more than Eighteen Months, and Frigates employed in Useless adventures. We had also Arms for 20 thousand Men and Clothing for forty nine thousand purchased in France and sent to the Stores to be Shipped in April last. The Capt. Of the Alliance was to have brought them but he came off and left them. We then hop'd they might come in the Ariel, but She has not arriv'd. In short, this season has Exhibited a Scene of Misfortunes, scarcely to be Equaled in History many of them have Arisen from unforeseen Events; & too many from our own inattention and Neglect. Measures are now taken for forwarding the Arms and Clothing. But to prevent the other Evil ari[sing from] Depreciation and Speculation is not so easy. The first loss of two Millions and a half of [Dollars] is inevitable: for the Credit of the last Money must be supported or Publick Faith can no longer Exist. To do this and prevent the loss on our Bills Specie must be introduced, to Circulate with the Bills, to redeem them and to act in all respects as an Auxilary to them. Perhaps it may be said that it was wrong to Issue these Bills in the manner they were Issued, to which I agree but it is now too late to prevent an Evil which has had all its Effects; and an attempt to remedy it would draw on Consequences still more Injurious.  I have the Honor to be one of the Committee for Arrainging our Finances,l and flatter myself that we shall yet have them established upon a respectable Footing.  Thus have I given You a True though Malencholy Picture of our Political Affairs and sincerely wish that truth would permit me to give You a more Pleasing One.  With respect to our Military Affairs, I can give you but little Information. Lord Cornwallis, since the famous Furgerson was Defeated has retreated towards Charlestown. Genl Green has gone on to take the Command from Gates. The British that landed at Portsmouth in Virginia remain there sending out small Parties to Pillage. Genl Clinton is about Imbarking with a large Force: I suppose for the Southern States to employ the Winter there as he did the last; though I [hope] not so successfully.  [I su]ppose You will readily conceive by the Account I [have] given that my Employment here is not of the most Entertaining kind. I freely confess it, and wish to be releived as soon as is convenient. I must at all Events be Home by the first of the Spring to look after my Farms which are now the only Barrier between me and extreem  Poverty. Perhaps if requested I may return again in the Summer. I wish as soon as the Assembly meets to know what Wages I am to expect (in real value) as the duty I owe to myself and Family will no longer permit me to serve the Publick in the highest and most perplexing offices to the ruin of my Fortune when even the common Soldier receives a superior reward and commands Superior Attention. This has ever been my misfortune since in Publick Service except when I had the Honor to serve in Congress before for Newhampshire.  And as it is my Duty to serve the Publick with Fidelity I at the same time ought to know what I am to expect as a reward for those Services .  With Respect to Vermont the case was several times Argued and at length Congress met to consider upon it at six in the Evening and sat till twelve: it was learnedly and Candidly Argued; The Agents on both sides attended without speaking. The Arguments ran so much against New York that the Agents who were before pressing a Decision have never Mentioned it since & thus it rests at present.(2) I am compell'd to inform You that I shall be in immediate want of Money. Articles are so dear here that You can scarce have a conception of it. Board without any thing but water to drink Eight hard Dollars per Week Then firewood and all Lyquors to be paid for. Horse keeping forty Dollars per Day. A common riding Saddle twenty one pound hard Money and every thing else in proportion and daily rising. In short a thousand Continental Dollars will not purchase what five formerly did.  I have the Honor to be most respectfully Dear Sir Your most Obedt Servt, Jno Sullivan  P.S. The exchange here, is from Eighty five to one Hundred and ten. The price of Articles in hard Money is on an Average three times as much as formerly upon this Price they take the Exchange in Continental money at about a Hundred for one so that three Dollars would formerly Purchase as much as nine Hundred will at this Time.

At the request of the honourable Mr. Matlack, I certify, that before the late election of Dr. Shippen as director general of the hospitals, I had a conversation with him on that subject; That he discovered great candour in his opinion; and, as far as it depended on his judgment, left me uninfluenced. JAMES DUANE.  Reprinted from the Pennsylvania Packet, or the General Advertiser, November 18, 1780.  (1) This \""declaration\"" consisted of the following note printed in the November 14 issue of the Packet: \""In your paper of Saturday last [November 11] Dr. Morgan had insinuated, that I had affirmed, that 'this state made a point of it, or would resent it if Doctor Shippen was not re appointed director general. ' I never made any such declaration, and it is a duty which I owe to myself to say so thus publickly, T. Matlack.\""  Dr. John Morgan's prosecution of Dr. William Shippen, Jr., director general of Continental hospitals, had been dealt a blow in July when a court-martial acquitted him of charges of corruption, and officially ended on August 18 when Congress, after a month of bitter debate, finally adopted a compromise resolution accepting Shippen's acquittal and ordering his release. Thereupon, Morgan took his crusade  NOVEMBER 17,1780  directly to the people of Pennsylvania via John Dunlap's Pennsylvania Packet, in which details of the case were aired in no fewer than 20 issues from September 2 to the end of December 1780.  Though greatly disturbed at Shippen's acquittal, Morgan was even more outraged at Congress' decision to reappoint Shippen director general on October 6, and subsequently broadened his attack in an ever more desperate bid to win support. One of the results was that in the November 11 issue of the Packet Morgan insinuated that Shippen's reappointment was due to the connivance of Timothy Matlack, secretary of the Pennsylvania Council, who was alleged to have argued in Congress that Pennsylvania would resent the decision if Shippen were not reappointed. Matlack thereupon responded by issuing the \""declaration\"" quoted above, printed the 14th, and securing the testimony of Ezekiel Cornell, Charles Thomson, and James Duane in support of his rebuttal of Morgan's allegation, printed here from the Packet of the 18th.  For the background of Morgan's campaign against Shippen, see John Armstrong to Horatio Gates, July 21, note; and Samuel Huntington to Shippen, October 9, 1780.

  [November 18, 1780](1) The underwritten Delegates of the State of Georgia propose, that the instructions to Mr. Jay, respecting the navigation of the Mississippi, and the territory claimed by several States upon its Eastern banks, be reconsidered; and that the ultimatum of these States, to the Court of Madrid, be given to the purport and in the manner following.  Whereas a powerful armed neutrality hath been formed in Europe, for the avowed purpose of vindicating and preserving the rights of a free Commerce, and a Congress of the neutral powers is intended to be held in the ensuing winter: by which, it is not improbable, Overtures of peace may be made, and that the principle, Uti possidetis, may be the foundation-a principle utterly inadmissable by these States.  And Whereas it has been represented, that the only bar to an alliance with Spain, which it is our great interest to effect, is, the navigation of the river Mississippi.  Resolved, therefore, that Mr. Jay be instructed, in case he shall find it indispensibly necessary, to yield in his instructions heretofore given, upon this subject; And that he be empowered to cede to the crown of Spain, the entire Navigation of the river Mississippi, together with a tract of territory, to begin upon the eastern bank of the said river, where the southern line of Georgia Strikes it, running along the said line Eastwardly to the river Mobille, and thence Northwardly to Cape Anthony on the said river: provided his Catholic Majesty shall, at the same time enter into a Treaty with these States, to be approved by Mr. Jay, and shall grant an annual Subsidy of half a million of pounds Sterling, for five years, or make a loan of double  NOVEMBER 18, 1780  that sum annually during the war, and shall agree not to Accede to proposals of peace, without the concurrence of these States, by their Minister plenepotentionary, appointed for that purpose.  Resolved, that an Envoy extraordinary be appointed to go to the Court of Versailles, to make, in concert with Mr. Franklin, the public representations of the United-states, And that he be charged also with the dispatches for Mr. Jay, which he is to send by a trusty courier, or, in case of his arriving upon or near the Coast of Spain, he shall proceed first to the Court of Madrid, and deliver them in person.  Ordered, that the board of Admiralty, be directed to have a frigate in readiness, to carry the said Envoy and dispatches to Europe.  Done at Philadelphia, the 10 November, 1780.

  Saturday November 18th. 1780. Present Mr. McKean, Mr. Bee, Mr. Ward, Mr. Sharpe, & Mr Matlack. Also Mr Gibson, Mr Forman, Mr Geddis, And Mr Nicholson. (1) Mr Huston (2) introduced and desired to give evidence on the charges exhibitted by the Com. of Treas. Agt. the Chambers of Accots. and the sd. charges were read whereupon Mr. Huston was requested to proceed.  Mr. Gibson rose and having made some observations on the propriety of having heard Mr Hustons evidence first in order-desired that the question then in his hand on paper might be proposed.  Mr Gibson was informed-That the Committee adhered to the mode of hearing the evidence first-and that afterwards he would be at liberty to ask any questions he pleased.(3)  Mr. Huston asked to what points he was to answer. It was replied-the charges of indolence &c as stated.(4)  While I attended the Treasury 10 Novr. 1779-for six months- The Board met at 9 in the Morning-the Members of Congress at NOVEMBER 18, 1780  9-himself frequently 8. His only mode of judging was from the time of attending of the Com. of Accots. Thus he sometimes did not find them all there at 9 oclock sometimes not at 10. That he attended also sometimes in the afternoon-at five oclock-that he did not make observations or remark any particular negligence-nor did he find them all there-but those who were there were generally employed and he allways found he could have the business he came about readily done.  I observed that except at those hours I cannot answer, being in Congress. I had no other opportunity of judging of the Case but from the reports made by the Chambers. Those that were made I did not pay particular attention to them with this board. Sometimes the Vouchers were few-sometimes many. Perhaps when the reports were few there might have been particular difficulties-the reports themselves may perhaps best show.  Mr. Huston continued.  As to incapacity.  So far as I can judge the accounts were properly stated. I was not altogether a competent judge of their abilities; but so far as I could judge their did not appear anything to prove but that they were capable. I suppose the question points to their abilities as accomptants. I have had no occasion to look into the business in any other view.  Partiality.  Do you know of any instances of it? (And the words of the charge was read).  An. I do not know any instance of that kind.  Mr Hopkinsons, Mr Gibsons & Mr Trickets accots. were mentioned.  Mr Huston. There were a variety of appeals upon reports; but it did not strike me that there appeared to be any instance of partiality in the Chambers of accounts.  Mr. Bickings accott. mentioned,(5) and the charge read. I recollect something about a hesitation in the board to allow Bickings accott. On an opinion, that the public was creditted too low for the Canvass- And I thus thought it ought to have been raised in proportion to the price of paper; but how the matter issued I cannot tell, perhaps the letters on that occasion may show.  Qu. Did you apprehend, that there was any partiality in the Chambers of Acts. in this instance?  An. I did not.  Maligning the Board of Treasury-(the charge read).  Observation by Mr Gibson. This was after Mr. Huston left the board.  Mr Huston. I dont know how I should know of that as a public charge. I have heard the Chambers of accotts. when my business   lead me to the Chambers of accotts. which was often, speak freely of the abilities of the Commisrs. of the Treasury, from which I supposed they did not think very highly of them.  Qu. Did you ever hear them say any thing injurious to the integrity and attention to business?  An. No.  Qu. Was what you have heard the Com. of Chambers say of the Com. of Trea. in public?  An. What I have heard them say has been in the Chambers, when there might have been the Com. of Chambers and perhaps the Assistant Auditor Genl.  Qu. Do you recollect any particular words expressed by them respecting the Com. Treas.?  An. I cannot recollect any particular expressions; but I have heard them express a sentinent That the Com. of Tr. were not in all respects the best qualified for the discharge of the trust committed to them- and perhaps so far as to intimate their temper or disposition as being not the most favourable for that station.  Questions by Mr. Gibson  To No. 1.  An. To the best of my recollection they did.  The several questions proposed by Mr. Gibson being read altogether,(6) it was moved, That the said questions should be delivered to Mr Huston to be answered by him in writing; but several questions not relating to the charges against the Chambers of accotts, being objected to-the committee agreed to hear and propose any questions offered by the Com. of Trea. which in any way tended to elucidate the charges against the Cham. of Accotts.(7) Q. No. 2. Do you know that the intention of the board of treasury, of fixing hours of office for the Chambers of accounts, was communicated to them or any of them?  A. I do not know that it was communicated officially-I believe it was not, that no copy of such was sent down to the chambers.  Q. Did not the board postpone their intention of fixing hours of office for the chambers on hearing from Mr. Troop that he had conversed with them about it?  A. The Account given by Colo. Troop had some influence with the board, I believe, to postpone it; I know it had with me, but I will not say this was the only reason.  Q. Was the matter of fixing hours of office for the Chambers renewed when you sat at the Board?  A. I dont recollect, whether or not.  Q. No. 6. of Mr Gibson's Questions in writing.(8)  A. I believe, it was one of the reasons; and that the fixing hours of business was necessary in all the offices.  Q. 7th. Asked.(9)  A. It appeared well enough, large & with light sufficient; it might be not so convenient on account of the heat, but I could have done business in it.  Q. Did I not prior to the 6th. of March 1780, when I let the house for 6 months for the treasury's use, reserve the chamber on the second floor, and part of the cellars?  A. I dont recollect, but I suppose the agreement was reduced to writing; I think it was in writing, and to that I refer.  N.B. Mr. Foreman then produced a writing to that effect, dated 27th Apl. which was after the report, of the Commissioners of the chambers on Gibson's Account for rent, was made.  No. 9Q. (10)  Ans. I remember there was such a proposal, but I do not recollect that we did any thing, but to advise the rent being settled on just and equitable principles-the general conversation I remember, but not particulars.  Mr. Hustons exam contd.  Qu. By Mr Mercier. Was there any official intelligence communicated to the Chambers of Accotts. of that conversation?  An. I believe there could not have been any official information upon it; but that may perhaps best appear from the minutes.  Qu. Who were those persons who were most frequently absent from the Chambers of accotts.?  An. I answered before, that I could not recollect any particular person.  Observation by Mr Mercier-That Mr Geddis & Mr. McComb were considerable time in the winter to the head of Elk on the settlement of Mr Hollingsworths Accotts, by order of the board of Treasury.  Ques. by Mr Geddis. Do you apprehend (from the knowledge you have of the ordnance that the Board of Treasury can be proper Judges of the business generally done in the Chambers; Or can it be possible that they can know the vouchers they go through unless an appeal is demanded?  An. They cannot judge of the difficulty of the Voucher; but they may know the number of Vouchers. Ten Vouchers may take up in one case, as much time as an hundred in another case.  Qu. From the business you have seen done by Mr Geddis, do you think he is an accomptant?  An. From what I know of Mr. Geddis, I had allways a good opinion of him.  Qu. (By Mr. Gibson to Mr. Govett). Did not I inform you, that the mode of stating his account of house rent was done by the opinion of the Board of Treasury?  Answr. Mr. Gibson did mention this to me.   Qu. By Mr. Govett to Mr. Nicholson. At what time did I usually attend at the Chambers in the morning & afternoon?  An. You were generally first there.  Qu. Was I ever absent two, three, or four days at a time, except when I was confined by sickness, or detained in consequence, of the death of my child?  An. [Approximately one-quarter page left blank. ]  Mr Duane (11) produced on the part of Mr Gibson.  Qu. Do you recollect whether Mr Gibson reserved the chamber on the second floor for his own use, at the time he let the house to the Treasury?(12)  An. He does not remember particulars but it is impressed on his mind and have no doubt that the sd. room was reserved to Mr. Gibson-who lodged in the house and the papers were considered as being secured by his residence there which was a public benefit.

  Gentlemen Philadelphia November l9th 1780 (1) It is with Infinite Anxiety and Concern that I hear of the Difficulties arising among You respecting the New Arrangement of the Army.  I am well convinced of the Sufferings of our Officers and have with Pleasure viewed the Fortitude and Firmness with which they Encountered and Surmounted every Difficulty and this even without any rational Hope of ever being put upon a respectable Military Establishment. But this Event has now taken Place and the Army has every thing to hope which can reasonably be expected or desired by Men who have ventured their All in defence of their Country; and even those who are to retire have proper and generous Provision made for them. But should this bring about a Contention for the Preference (not for remaining in Service but) for retiring will not this cast a shade over all their virtuous Actions and induce Mankind to believe that Interest and Ease have gained the Ascendency over Publick and Military Virtue.  Those Members of Congress who exerted themselves to obtain a proper and Honorable Establishment for their Officers had so good an Opinion of their Military Ambition that they believed there would be a contention among them for remaining in Service but by no means for retiring and I shall be exceedingly mortified if I am Compell'd to Change my Sentiments especially with respect to the Newhampshire Line.  I am Informed some doubts have arisen respecting the Resolve of Congress which I wish to explain.  Congress directed a meeting of the Officers of each State (not for determining who should go home) but to fix upon proper Officers to Command the Regiments of the respective States and where they could not agree it was to be determined by Seniority the Obvious and Natural Constructions is that where the Corps could not be Established by agreement they were to be compleated by Seniority. Whoever would put a different Construction upon it must suppose that Congress meant at once to get rid of all their old and Experienced Officers and to put the Army under the Command of Young and Inexperienced Men. This Construction is not only against the natural and obvious meaning of the Words but against common Sense and reason, and I confess I was not a little surprised to hear that some Officers in the Newhampshire Line had supposed that this was the meaning of Congress.  Permit me Gentlemen to Intreat Your Perseverance in gaining the Object so long and Nobly contended for: and You may rest assured that those brave Men who continue in Service will have in NOVEMBER 19, 1780  Addition to the Applauses of a grateful Country every Emolument which the nature of our Service will admit.

  My dear Sir Philadelphia Novr 20th 1780 In your Letter of the 17th of Septr (1) which is still before me you say, that \""the Tongue of Malice has always been employed against me,\"" and in mentioning it, you discover the Feelings of a Friend. It may perhaps in some Measure relieve those Feelings, if I tell you that it serves to make me the more watchful over my self, lest by any Misconduct, I should afford Occasion to malicious Men, to say that of me which would give me just Cause to be ashamd. It is said to be a Misfortune to a Man, when all speak well of him. Is it then an Advantage to a Man, that he has Enemies? It may be so, if he has Wisdom to make a good Use of them. We are apt to be partial, in our own Judgment of ourselves. Our friends are either blind to our Faults, or not faithful enough to tell us of them. The malicious Man will utter all Manner of Evil of us, and contrive Means to send it post haste to our Ears; and if among much Slander, they say some Truths, what have we to do, but to correct past Errors, & guard against future ones. The Report you mention as propagated of me, is groundless.(2) Would any Man in his Senses, who wishes that the War may be carried on with Vigor, prefer the temporary and expensive Drafts of Militia, to a permanent and well appointed Army! But Envy knows no other Business than to calumniate.  Mr Penny has deliverd me your Favor of the 2d Instant.(3) He has also brought us a Paper which exhibits a Picture of the Times. You express too much Resentment at the Ingratitude which you imagine has been shown to your Friend (4)-that his Name has not been found in any of the Lists, and especially that he could not be supported NOVEMBER 20, 1780  in Competition with Mr ____.(5) Your Friend makes no Claims on his Country, nor does he set himself in Competition with Mr_____ whose Connexions have made him a necessary Man. He is, I confess, one whom I have esteemd for his Honesty and easy good Humour. We have been entertaind with the Speeches both before and after putting on the Regalias, and we expect to see Congratulatory Addresses from various Orders, civil and ecclesiastick. I shall pity the Governor if he is apt to be discomposd with the high Complimentary Stile. I could wish, if we must have abundant Addresses to see the manly Simplicity of Barckly the Quaker in his Dedication to Charles the 2d of England.(6) Excepting that Instance, I do not recollect ever to have seen an Address to a Great Man, that was not more or less, and very often deeply, tincturd with Flattery.  If the Town Clerk of Ephesus,(7) has \""treated me with great Disrespect,\"" I am sorry for him. It gives me no uneasiness on my own Account. If he treats every one in that way who \""will not worship the Great Image,\"" he leaves me in the best of Company-Company which he may at another Time, find it his Interest, if that governs him, to court and respect. We are even reduced to the Hutchinsonian Times, if a Citizen shall think himself constraind to malign his old Friend, merely because the Great Man has been prevaild upon to mark him as his Enemy! But the History of all Ages and all Countries shows, that there is no Absurdity into which Idolatry will not lead Men. Pray remember me to My Friend Mr Gerry and tell him I have not forgot his Letters & that I will write him soon. All my Friends complain of me for Omission on that Score.

W be and he is hereby fully authorized & empowered to carry into Executn. in the most compleat & ample manner such measures as shall appear to him best calculated for raising & bringing into the field on or before the 1st day of Janry next an Army of 25000 men to continue in the service of these united states during the present war with Great Britain, to provide arms ammunition, cloathing, military & hospital Stores & Camp Equipage of all Kinds, Waggons, horses and forage, to supply the said army with all Kinds of provisions & refreshments, to lay up such magazines of provisions, forage, military and hospital stores & Camp Equipage as he shall judge are necessary, to appoint such Officer or Officers in the said Army as shall be from time to time required, and to bring to tryal all officers whose conduct may render it necessary and to carry into execution such sentence as shall be awarded by a court martial-To call forth from time to time such & so many of the militia of these united states as in his opinion may be necessary. And he the said Gen. W is by these presents required in the most speedy & effectual manner to carry compleatly & vigorously into execution the Powers & authorities hereby vested in him and to do all such other matters & things as shall appear to him necessary to promote the Wellfare of these united states, to draw on the Treasury of the United States for such Sums of money as shall be required to defray the Expences incurred in consequence of the powers to him delegated. And the Congress of these United States do in the most solemn manner pledge themselves to the said Gen. W fully & vigorously to support him and to ratify whatever shall be by him done in the premises .  That the foregoing power & authorities continue and they are hereby declared to be in full force until the 1 st day of December 1781 and no longer.  I will endeavor to get some Decency for Genl. W--if it is only plump Denial of Justice.(6) Perhaps as Mr. Matlac is joined to Mr. Fell there may be neither Denial nor Equivocation.(7)  \""Is it not Time to pay a Visit to Mass. \"" Does my Wife look as if she wanted a toothless grey headed sciatic Husband near her?

  Sir, November 21, 1780.  Your recommendation of Mr. Penny, and his Admiralty cause,(1) to the Delegates of Massachusetts here present, has had its due influence; and your particular introduction to me of Mr. Gridley's business, has stimulated that attention which the justice of his own request had excited in me to put the bill of exchange into a proper line of acceptance or protest. The antiquity of the draught, makes a careful search of the journals necessary far back. I have been to the Treasury and Admiralty Boards, but got not full satisfaction there. I shall consult Mr. Bingham, who was connected with Chew; I wish the Eastern Navy Board had been consulted, as Mr. Secretary Brown, tells me Chew's accounts were closed by them. I think it probable however that the duplicate bills has never been paid.(2) This occasion of writing on a matter of business, prevents the appearance of adulating formality, while I add my wishes for your happiness and prosperity in the execution of the honourable commission to which I find by the public papers you have been elected with much unanimity.  I am your Excellency's Very humble Servant,  James Lovell MS not found, reprinted from the New York Royal Gazette, December 27, 1780. One of several delegate letters intercepted by the British and published in James Rivington's Royal Gazette, for which see John Sullivan to Meshech Weare, November 15, 1780.  Rivington printed this letter following Lovell's November 20 letter to Elbridge Gerry, which contains a biblical allusion to the worship of the Golden Calf by the followers of Moses suggesting a parallel with the adulation of Hancock by the people of Massachusetts. Because Lovell himself descended to a bit of hypocritical adulation of Hancock in the present letter, Rivington took delight in this opportunity to expose Lovell's \""duplicity,\"" which he explained in the following introductory statement. \""However unimportant the following epistle from the Boston Schoolmaster may be considered, we have inserted it to expose the duplicity of his heart, of which the Reader will be convinced on comparing the complementary Italics, with Lovell's allusions to his friend Mr. Hancock, in the beginning of his letter to Mr. Gerry. \""  NOVEMBER 21, 1780  (1) The subject of the \""Admiralty cause\"" of Timothy Penny of Jamaica Plain, Mass., is not clear, but it may relate to the permission he had received in May 1779 to ship produce from his former home in Jamaica for the support of his numerous family.\"" See JCC, 14:671-72.  2 As a result of Lovell's efforts, Congress referred this matter to the Board of Admiralty on November 25. The bills at issue were dated December 8, 1777, and had been drawn on Hancock as president of Congress by Capt.

  Dear Sir, Philada. Novr. 21st. 1780 Your favor of the 10th (1) came by yesterdays post. I am glad to find you have at last got a house and have made so auspicious a beginning, as a unanimous vote to fill up our line for the war. This is a measure which all the States ought to have begun with. I wish there may not be some that will not be prevailed on even to end with it. It is much to be regretted that you are not in a condition to discontinue another practice equally destructive with temporary enlistments. Unless an end can by some means or other be put to State emissions & certificates they must prove the bane of every salutary regulation. The depreciation in this place has lately run up as high as 100 for 1, and it cannot be satisfactorily accounted for on any other principle than the substitution of certificates in the payment of those taxes which were intended to reduce its quantity and keep up a demand for it. The immediate cause of this event is said to have been the sudden conversion of a large quantity of paper into specie by some Torys lately ordered into exile by this State. It is at present on the fall and I am told the Merchants have associated to bring it down & fix it at 75. The fate of the new money is as yet suspended. There is but too much reason however to fear that it will follow the fate of the old. According to the arrangement now in force it would seem impossible for it to rise above 1 for 40. The resolutions of Congress which establish that relation between the two kinds of paper must destroy the equality of the new with specie unless the old can be kept down at 40 for 1. In New Jersey I am told the Legislature have lately empowered the Executive to regulate the exchange between the two papers according to the exchange between the old & the new, in order to preserve the equality of the latter with specie.(2) The issue of this experiment is of consequence, and may throw light perhaps on our paper finance. The only infallible remedy whilst we can not command specie, for the pecuniary embarrassments we labour under, will after all be found, to be a punctual collection of the taxes required by Congress .  I hope you will not forget to call the attention of the Assembly as early as the preparations for defence will admit to the means of NOVEMBER 21, 1780  ratifying the confederation, nor to remind it of the conditions which prudence requires should be annexed to any territorial cession that may be agreed on. I do not believe there is any serious design in Congress <<to listen to the claims> to gratify the avidity of land mongers, but the best security for their virtue in this respect will be to keep it out of their power. They have been much infested since you left us with memorials from these people; who appear to be equally alarmed & perplexed. Mr. G. Morgan as Agent for the Indiana claimants after memorializing Congress on the subject has honored the Virginia Delegates with a separate attention.(3) He very modestly proposes to them a reference of the Controversy between the Company & Virginia to arbitration in the mode pointed out in the Confederation for adjusting disputes between State & State. We have given him for answer that as the State we represent had finally determined the question, we could not with any propriety attend to his proposition, observing at the same time that if we were less precluded, we could not reconcile with the sovereignty & honor of the State an appeal from its own Jurisdiction to a foreign tribunal, in a controversy with private individuals.  The last account we had of the embarkation at N. York was that the Ships had fallen down to the Hook, that the number of troops as well as their destination was unknown, That Philips was to command them. The Cork fleet is I fear at last certainly arrived. The 2d Division of French fleet has not yet made its appearance. It is made a question at present whether the squadron taken for it, as mentioned in my last was not a British fleet. Mr. Adams in a letter of the 23 of Augst. from Amsterdam received yesterday speaks of General Provosts being sent out from England with a few frigates (and it is to be supposed some land forces as he is a land officer-though Mr. Adams does not expressly say as much) for Cape fear to facilitate the Operations of the Enemy in N. Carolina. A New York paper of the 17th announces the death of your worthy friend General Woodford.(4) I suppose it has reached you through some other channel before this.  I have the books of Accts. with the papers connected with them ready to go forward to the Auditors under the care of Col. Febiger who will in a day or two send off a number of Waggons for the Southward. I shall soon write you on some private matters which ought not to be entrusted to a conveyance by post.(5)  I have engaged to take Pleasant's house for you on the terms given in to you with this difference, that one quarter of the rent is to be paid on the first of January and remainder as it becomes due, and you are to pay for the whole year if you leave it in Novr. The first of these conditions I was authorised to make, the last I thought it better to submit to than leave you unaccomodated or on a footing of uncertainty. You will be at liberty [to] keep it a second year on   the same terms if you please. [I] hope you will not leave it at the time you proposed to limit the bargain to and at any rate you can only lose two months rent a little more than 4 half Joes, a sum not worth regarding in a matter of such consequence to your private convenience & perhaps to the public service. He engages to let you have the furniture you saw in the house and says he will spare you any other Articles which he may not need himself but I believe it would be prudent not [to] rely much on this resource.  I am Yrs. Sincerely, J. Madison Junr.  ""

  Dear Sir Philada. Novr. 21, 1780 Your favor of 13th came safe yesterday. (1) The past week has brought forth very little of consequence, except the disagreeable and I fear certain information of the arrival of the Corke fleet. Our last account of the embarkation at N. york was that the Ships had fallen down to the Hook, that the number of troops was quite unknown, as well as their destination, except in general that it was Southwardly. It is still said that Philips is to command this detachtment. If the projected junction between Leslie & Corn[w]allis had not been so opportunely frustrated by the gallant volunteers at King's Mountain it is probable that Philips would have reinforced the former, as the great force in his rear would otherwise have rendered every advance hazardous. At present it seems more likely that the declining state of their Southern affairs will call their attention to that quarter. They can it is well known regain at any time their present footing in Virginia if it should be thought expedient to abandon it, or to collect in their forces to a defensible point, but every retrograde step they take towards Charlestown, proves fatal to their general plan. Mr. J. Adams in a letter of the 23d of Augst. from Amsterdam received yesterday, says that Genl. Prevost had sailed from England with a few frigates for Cape fear in order to facilitate the operations of their Arms in N. Carolina, and that the Ministry were determined to make the Southern States, the scene of a very active Winter Carnpaign. No intimation is given by Mr. Adams of the number of troops under NOVEMBER 21, 1780  Genl Prevost. The 2d division of the French fleet mentioned in my last to have been off Bermuda, has not yet made its appearance. It is now rather supposed to have been a British one. The death of Genl Woodford is announced in a N. York paper of the 17th. I have not seen the paper, but am told no particulars are mentioned. I suppose it will reach his friends before this will be recd through some other channel. Adieu, J. Madison Junr.  ""

  Dear Sir Philada Novr. 25th. 1780 I informed you some time ago that the instructions to Mr. Jay had passed Congress in a form which was entirely to my mind. I since informed you that a Committee was preparing a letter to him explanatory of the principles & objects of the instructions. (1) This letter also passed in a form equally satisfactory. I did not suppose that any thing further would be done on the subject, at least till further intelligence should arrive from Mr Jay. It now appears that I was mistaken. The Delegates from Georgia & South Carolina, apprehensive that a Uti possidetis may be obtruded on the belligerent powers by the armed neutrality in Europe and hoping that the accession of Spain to the Alliance will give greater concert & success to the military operations that may be pursued for the recovery of these States, and likewise add weight to the means that may be used for obviating a Uti possidetis, have moved for a reconsideration of the Instructions in order to empower Mr. Jay in case of necessity to yield to the claims of Spain on condition of her guarantieng our independence and affording us a handsome subsidy. The expediency of such a motion is further urged from the dangerous negociations now on foot by British Emissaries for detaching Spain from the war. Wednesday last was assigned for the consideration of this motion and it has continued the order of the day ever since without being taken up 2 What the fate of it will be I do not predict but whatever its own fate may [be] it must do mischief in its operation. It will not probably be concealed that such a motion has been made & supported, and the weight which our demands would derive from unanimity & decision must be lost. I flatter myself however that Congress will see the impropriety of sacrificing the acknowledged limits and claims of any State without the express concurrence of such State Obsticles enough will be thrown in the way of peace, if [it] is to be bid for at the expence of particular members of the Union. The Eastern States must on the first suggestion take the alarm for their fisheries. If they will not support other States in their rights they cannot expect to be supported themselves when theirs come into question.  In this important business, which so deeply affects the claims & NOVEMBER 25, 1780  interests of Virginia & which I know she has so much at heart, I have not the satisfaction to harmonise in Sentiment with my Colleague. He has embraced an opinion that we have no just claim to the subject in controversy between US & Spain, and that it is the interest of Virginia not to adhere to it. Under this impression he drew up a letter to the Executive to be communicated to the Legislature, stating in general the difficulty Congress might be under, & calling their attention to a revision of their instructions to their Delegates on the subject.(3) I was obliged to object to such a step, and in order to prevent it observed that the instructions were given by the Legislature of Virga. on mature consideration of the case, & on a supposition that Spain would make the demands she has done, that no other event has occurred to change the mind of our Constituents but the Armed neutrality in Europe & the successes of the Enemy to the Southward which are as well known to them as to ourselves, that we might every moment expect a third delegate here, (4) who would either adjust or decide the difference in opinion between us, and that whatever went from the Delegation would then go in its proper form & have its proper effect, that if the instructions from Virga. were to be revised and their ultimatum reduced, it could not be concealed in so populous an Assembly, and every thing which our Minister should be authorised to yield would be insisted on, that Mr. Jays last dispatches encouraged us to expect that Spain would not be inflexible if we were so, that we might every day expect to have more satisfactory information from him. That finally if it should be thought expedient to listen to the pretensions of Spain, it would be best before we took any decisive step in the matter to take the Counsel of those who best know the interests & have the greatest influence on the opinions of our Constituents, that as you were both a member of Congress & of the Legislature & were now with the latter, you would be an unexceptionable medium for effecting this, and that I would write to you for the purpose, by the first safe conveyance.  These objections had not the weight with my Colleague which they had with me. He adhered to his first determination & has I believe sent the letter above mentioned by Mr. Walker who will I suppose soon forward it to the Governour. You will readily conceive the embarrassments this affair must have cost me. All I have to ask of you is that if my refusing to concur with my Colleague in recommending to the legislature a revision of their instructions should be misconstrued by any, you will be so good as to place it in its true light, and if you agree with me as to the danger of giving express power to concede, or the inexpediency of conceding at all, that you will consult with Gentlemen of the above description and acquaint me with the result.  I need not observe to you that the alarms with respect to the inflexibility of Spain in her demands, the progress of British intrigues   at Madrid and the danger of a Uti possidetis, may with no small probability be regarded as artifices for securing her objects on the Mississippi. Mr. Adams in a late letter from Amsterdam, a copy of which has been enclosed to the Governor supposes that the pretended success of the British emissaries at Madrid is nothing but a ministerial finesse to facilitate the loans and keep up the spirits of the people.(5) This will be conveyed by Col. Grayson, (6) who has promised to deliver it himself, or if any thing unforeseen should prevent his going to Richmond, to put it into such hands as will equally ensure its safe delivery.  I am Dr Sr. yrs. Sincerely, J. Madison Junr.  ""

Sensible of your Situation & Course of Business I feared to write Lest your Politeness Should Divert your attention from important matters & Lead you to answer Even where an Answer appeared unnecessary. But I now take the Liberty of assuring you that I Shall not Expect Frequent or Lengthy answers. When the Nature of my Letter requires & your Liesure will permit I Shall promise myself an answer & not otherwise.  I Shall take the Liberty of Informing your Excellency from time to time of Those Points which Turn up in Congress & are interesting to the Publick in General or the Army in Particular & Shall Continue This without Expecting regular or Frequent answers.  I am happy that the Late Regulations are Pleasing to your Excellency;(2) & with you Lament that They were not Sooner adopted: But I can with great Truth assure you that they are not now the offspring of Choice but necessity which perhaps has been Lately Painted in more Striking Colors & has been more realized than formerly.  I am Sensible of the injurious Consequences of Sending out requisitions at so Late a Period (3) But I flatter myself That The States will yield a Chearful & Speedy Compliance as I have Seen An Act from Connecticut and Answers from other States which promise much toward a Speedy Supply.  I will Endeavor to have it mentioned in Colo Palfreys Instructions to obtain materials in preference to ready made Cloathes for the reasons you mention. Colo. Palfrey is appointed Consul & Commercial agent.(4) The means you have been pleased to point out are Fortunately Adopted. Congress have in the most Decent & at the Same time in the most pressing Terms Solicited a Loan & I have Long Since without the knowledge of Congress Solicited the French Minister and Mr Marbois to favor the application which they have already Done by writing to the French Court warmly in favor of it.(5)  I am fully Sensible of the Evils arising in the Cloathing Department,  NOVEMBER 26, 1780  a report is now on the Table for regulating it; which I hope will pass this week.(6) The mode you mention for future Provisions I hope will be Adopted. We have had Cloathing Sufficient for the Army at Cape Francois Eighteen months & a Sufficiency on the Shores of France Since April Last; e we have had a number of Frigates Employed in useless adventures. This Clearly proves the Justice of your observation respecting The attention of Congress being Taken up in Trivial affairs while great Nations Concerns have been Neglected.

  Philade Nove 27 1780 Let me intreat you, my dear Sir, not to think me unmindful of the several Favors I have receivd from you since I arrivd in this City. I hate Protestations among Friends, and the making Apologies is so formal a Business, that I know not in what Manner to begin it. Yet it seems necessary that I should say something in Excuse for my not having written to you. Shall I tell you of my trembling Hand, & how unfit an Instrument it is to quide a Pen? I do assure you that writing is on that Account become painful to me. I am perswaded you never doubted the Reality of my Friendship for you, and I solemnly affirm it has not abated a single Iota. Let this suffice on the Score of Apology and permit me to hope that I shall receive your Letters frequently, while I remain here, which however will be only till the next Spring. I shall then take my final [le]ave of Congress, & seek that Retirement from publick Cares, which my Country seems to point out for me, [&] to which my own Inclination leads me.  I perceive it has been in your Option, to take a [se]at in either House of the General Assembly, or [re]turn to Congress.(1) I cannot say in which of these [de]partments you will have it in your Power to render [the] most substantial Service to the Publick. We feel [the] Want of you here; and yet I think you have wisely [ch]osen a Seat for the present in the House of Representatives. Many Virtuous Men there may want that Information which you are able to give. Possibly you may have [m]uch of the old Ground to go over again. More in my opinion, is necessary to be done, than conquering our British Enemies in order to establish the Liberties of our Country on a solid  NOVEMBER 27, 1780  Basis. Human Nature, I am affraid, is too much debas'd to relish those Republican Principles, in which the new Government of the Common Wealth of Massachusetts appears to be founded. And may it not be added, that the former Government, I mean the last Charter, being calculated rather to make servile Men than free citizens, the Minds of many of our Countrymen have been inurd to a cringing obsequiousness, too deeply wrought into Habit to be easily eradicated? Mankind is prone enough to political Idolatry. Such a temper is widely different from that reverance which every virtuous Citizen will show to the upright Magistrate. If my Fears on this Head are ill grounded, I hope I shall be excusd. They proceed from a cordial Affection for that Country to the Service of which I have devoted the greatest Part of my Life. May Heaven inspire the present Rulers with Wisdom & sound Understanding. In all Probability they will stamp the Character of the People. It is natural for sensible Observers to form an Estimate of the People from the opinion they have of those whom they set up for their Legislators & Magistrates. And besides, if we look into the History of Governors, we shall find that their Principles & Manners have always had a mighty Influence on the People. Should Levity & Foppery ever become the ruling Taste of the Great, the Body of the People would be in Danger of catching the Distemper, and the ridiculous Maxims of the one would become fashionable among the other. I pray God we may never be addicted to Vanity & the Folly of Parade! Pomp & Show serve very well to promote the Purposes of European & Asiatick Grandeur, in Countries where the Mystery of Iniquity is carried to the highest Pitch, & Millions are tame enough to believe they are born for no other Purpose than to be subservient to the capricious Will of a single Great Man or a few! It requires Council & sound Judgment to render our Country secure in a flourishing Condition. If Men of Wisdom & Knowledge, of Moderation & Temperance, of Patience, Fortitude & Perseverance, of Sobreity & true Republican Simplicity of Manners, of Zeal for the Honor of the Supreme Being & the Welfare of the Common Wealth-If Men possessed of these & other excellent Qualities are chosen to fill the Seats of Government we may expect that our Affairs will rest on a solid & permanent Foundation.  I thank you my dear Sir, for mentioning my Family so affectionately in one of your Letters. Oblige them with your Visits as often as you can. Remember me to Colo Orne, who, I have Reason to think is among my Friends. Adieu and believe me to be most sincerely, yours, S A  ""

  Dear Sir Philadelphia 28th Novemr 1780 I last wrote to your Excellency by General Scott. (1) We have since received dispatches from Holland (2) and have the satisfaction to find that Mr Adams has received his powers to execute the Trust reposed in Mr Lawrence now a Prisoner of war in England. The Claims of Ireland are still unsatisfied and they have passed an Act to prevent, by a severe duty, the Importation of unrefined Sugar from England; insisting that it shall be brought directly from the Islands into their ports; and claiming in every other Respect a perfect Equality with what they call their Sister Kingdom. The Courtiers in that parliament were averse to this Measure, but the Patriot Councilor Yelverton told them that his Argument should be concise. If they woud not agree to it, he woud put himself at the head of the Associators. This is a mode of reasoning which proves irresistible. By the way is it not the highest Insolence that while the Claims of Ireland are submitted to from [ . . . ] and preparations to enforce them by Arms; Americans are persecuted as Rebels for exercising the same Right? Holland continues to be rent into Faction. The Statholder, under british Influence, restrains some of the provinces from acting with vigour: While the Republican party in all seem resolved to support our Cause and are earnest for Close Alliance with Us. In England the Crown has acquired additional strength by the misconduct of the People headed by Lord George Gordon. It is said the late Elections have proved unfavourable to the Patriots, and that several of the most distinguished have lost their Seats in Parliament. But it is a general NOVEMBER 28, 1780  Opinion that the Convention of the Neutral powers will have a much greater Effect upon the British Cabinet than the Eloquence of Angells. Lord Shelbourn in their House of Peers declared that it was to be taken for granted that the united States woud be admitted to that Convention as an Independant people. Indeed All Accounts agree that the great Powers of Europe are altogether advocates for our Freedom, and the ministerial writers in late publications whine and complain that All mankind are Ingrates, and that they are left without an Ally to contend against France Spain & America; they might add Ireland to the Catalogue: for the Liberation of that Kingdom will eventually press them to the Quick, and tend to the Destruction of her Commerce as much as anyother Cause. In the mean time they have manifested a servility in offering Assistance to the Russian fleet, that Armed merely to humble their maritime power, which cannot fail to render them contemptible. With the same low Condescension they have endeavour[ed] to sooth and cajole the Courts of France and Spain and seem prepared to sacrifice every Sentiment of Glory, & every Prospect of national Advantage if America can be deserted and left to their Vengeance. These Courts however seem resolved to pursue the War, and France, in every Event, to maintain her Alliance. Besides the Ties of Honour, their future Safety, and a desire to recover the disgraces of the last War; both these Nations are become responsible for their Conduct to the Northern Powers: Nor can any thing Justify them to themselves or to Europe. While these States by vigorously persevering to establish their Freedom call down the Admiration and Respect of Mankind.  From Intelligence out of our Capitol, it appears that the Enemy expressed great Chargin and disappointment on examining the new Arrangement for the Campaign which they intercepted. They had hoped, it seems, that we were to much broken to attempt a formidable Opposition. If the Views of Congress are seconded by the states, and the Army & Supplies which we have requested punctually produced: it is the general Opinion that the Enemy will relinquish the American War and think seriously of preserving their remaining Dominions. One decisive Effort will be of more Avail than languid & precarious operations for years. But these Observations need not be made to your Excellency who has long been impressed with the Necessity of vigorous Measures to expell the Enemy.  The late Hurricane in the West Indies has produced such Horrible Devastations; that nothing equal to it has happened perhaps Since the Deluge. Only partial Accounts have yet come to hand: but the Tempest continuing many days with unabated Violence; it may be concluded that its Effects have been dreadful in the Islands both Windward & Leeward. It must prove a fatal Blow to Britain: but our Ally has a great Share in the Calamity. The Loss of Shipping and Lives must be prodigious.   I cannot but say, excepting in the Case of Vermont, that I never enjoyed so much Satisfaction in the proceedings of Congress as at this Time. There is a decision and spirit in their measures which had become indispensably necessary. They have made All the Preparations for the next Campaign with the utmost Unanimity and to the entire Satisfaction of the Commander in Chief.  I continue alone to represent the State. It is a Confidence which I endeavoured to deserve by unremited Application; and by devoting my whole Time to the publick Business. Habit, and a great Share of Health, make it tolerable; and a Hope that I am serviceable to the Country reconciles me to continue so long in a Station on some Accounts undesireable. The Want of a decent Support from the State is among the Number of discouragements which give me disquiet: there are others which must occur to your Excellency of a Nature much more general and consequential.  Be pleased to present my most respectful Compliments to Mrs. Clinton and Col. Benson.  I have the Honour to be with the utmost Respect; and Affection, Dear Sir, Your Excellency's most Obedient & very humble Servant, Jas Duane  ""

  Sir, Philada. 28 November 1780 By our Advices Yesterday from the Southward (1) we find that the Enemy continue to retreat in South Carolina and that they are in great Distress for Supplies and much debilitated by Sickness. Our Troops will probably be still more straitened than they, because they have to follow on a Route which the Enemy have gleaned. Vast Expenses are before us, and our Resources slowly produced. It has often occurred to me how uncomfortable is the situation of Congress, without Power, and without Means, and yet berated for all Defects in the publick Operations and looked to for what every Body knows NOVEMBER 28, 1780  it is impossible they should have. Every little Trapstick of a Quarter master or Commissary or Forage-picker, who has spent the publick Money himself and either has bought Nothing to feed the Army or Transport, or has paid Nothing for what he has bought, gets in a Passion and swears at Congress all over the Country that they do not furnish Money and will not pay their Debts. He owes Nobody; Congress owes; though neither they, nor any of their Members have ever seen or heard of him. It is a curious Situation when every little peddling Scoundrel or broken Shopkeeper can make Congress a Debtour to all the Amount he can prostitute the publick Credit for. I long to see the States in earnest to have none but honest, respectable Officers of their own, and that none should be appointed in the Continental Staff, because Congress can never know them, except in the highest Branches of the Departments; and I wish how soon the States may feel the Length and Breadth of their Resources because there is the only Fork. Congress ought to have more Power or the States more Vigour and Attention.  The Advices from Virginia are that the Enemy have embarked their Forces from Portsmouth,(2) but had not sailed the l9th inst. A report comes from Baltimore that when our Troops marched down Portsmouth, and a Number of Citizens went in through Curiosity, the Enemy stood up Nansemond River and landed to occupy the Isthmus so as to insulate them and cut off all Retreat. It is mentioned that near 5000 are thus taken in. The Enemy said to be about 3000. If the Ancien! Dominion cannot refuse these, what are they worth? However the whole is private Intelligence; nothing official; and few believe any Thing of it.  Many Circumstances make it probable that there is a French or Spanish Fleet or a Fleet combined of both, on the Southern Coast; but am afraid they have suffered in the Hurricane which has made such Havock in the West-Indies. If they have escaped this, they may be of effectual Service to us.  I have received the Nomination and Election of Delegates.(3) Find that my Name is continued which I little expected. Several of the Gentlemen who have not been carried, could have attended much better. However as there are five, I cannot think of refusing. If I have any Reputation, it stands me in Hand to preserve it, and not shrink from Duty, for I have Nothing else left. If my Credit goes, I may safely say, I have literally Nothing.  I hope to see your Excellency in a few Days, when I shall wish the Liberty of giving you a better Detail of Intelligence-both at Home and abroad.  I have the Honour to be, your Excellency's very humble, and most obedt Servant, WC Houston  ""

  Dr. Sir Philada. Novr. 28th. 1780 Yrs . of the 18th came yesterday. (1) I am glad to find the legislature persist in their resolution to recruit their line of the army for the war, though without deciding on the expediency of the mode under their consideration. Would it not be as well to liberate and make soldiers at once of the blacks themselves as to make them instruments for enlisting white Soldiers? It wd. certainly be more consonant to the principles of liberty which ought never to be lost sight of in a contest for liberty, and with white officers, & a majority of White Soldrs., no imaginable danger could be feared from themselves, as there certainly could be none from the effect of the example on those who should remain in bondage: experiance having shewn that a freedman immediately loses all attachment & sympathy with his former fellow slaves.  I informed you in my last that I had engaged Pleasants' house for you. Pemberton would come to no agreement on the subject. I have received the £2000 your share of the draught on Meade & Compy. and the residue of the draught has all been paid. I will endeavor to send you the Journals by the first opportunity. They are too heavy to go by post. I wrote to you too [two] days ago by Col. Grayson on the subject of the Mis____ pi. Mr. Walker set out a few days ago, accompanied by Mr. Kinlock, who is soon to be in a very near relation to him. The Books of Accts. are on the way. We have enclosed to the Govr. a copy of an Act of the Legislature of Connecticut ceding some of their territorial claim to the United States, which he will no doubt communicate to the Assembly.(2) They reserve the jurisdiction to themselves, and clog the cession with some other conditions which greatly depreciate it, and are the more extraordinary as their title to the land is so controvertible a one.  The evacuation of Portsmouth was received with much satisfaction, but a story from Baltimore that it was a manoeuvre & ended in the Enemy's running up Nansemond and entrapping our army below although exceedingly improbable has thrown us into an uneasy suspence. By accounts from the W. Indies there has been in the Windwd. Islands one of the most violent & desolating hurricates ever NOVEMBER 28, 1780  known. The British Islands have been laid almost entirely waste, and most of their shipping with their crews lost. Such an event with the interception of the destined supply of provision by the Combined fleets in Europe, cannot fail to bring on great distress if not a general famine. The French islands have also suffered severely.  The Association of the Merchants for fixing the depreciation seems likely to prove a salutary measure. It reduced it from 90 & 100 to 75 at once, which is its present current rate; although it is observed that many of the retailers elude the force of it by raising the price in hard money.  I am Dr Sir Yr. Affecty J. Madison Junr.  ""

  Dear Sir, Philad'a, 29th Novem'r 1780. I had the Honour of writing to your Excellency yesterday. Col. Blaine being detained gives me the opportunity of adding that the Resolutions of our Legislature respecting their Quota of Troops to be provided for, remain still under Commitment.(1) It is really difficult to establish an equal Rule of Justice in that Respect. I have thought of laying down this principle: that the Person who had gained a legal Settlement in any State at the period of his Inlistment should be transferred to that State. With respect to the Artificers: that they should all be provided for by Congress; not only on account of the Inequality of their pay; but because the Burthen woud otherwise fall most heavily on the states which had large Capitols.  How these Rules especially the first woud operate or whether they NOVEMBER 29, 1780  woud give Satisfaction ought well to be considered and I wish for your Excellency's Sentiments as soon as possible.  Our Vermont business remains quiet; but is not forgotten. I foresee there must be a Rehearing: as there is a considerable Change in the House not for the worse. Nor will the late Conduct of these distracted People-if it is true that they have made a truce with the Enemy- gain them Favour. I shall do my duty at every Event.  I enclose your Excellency the papers of the day, and have the Honour to be, with every Sentiment of Respect and personal attention, Dear Sir, your Excelleney's Affectionate And most Obedient Servant, Jas.

  Dear General Philadelphia November [2]9th 1780 (1) I was this morning Honored with your Excellency's favor of the 25th Instant;(2) I shall be happy to See the Chavalier De Chaltelieux and to pay him every mark of respect & attention in my Power.  The Confidence your Excellency is pleased to place in me is exceeding flattering and I can with great Truth assure you That no person Desires more to Comply with your wishes, relieve you from the anxiety you Suffer; (from Difficulties which as Commander of the Army you never ought to Experience), or to render your Troops happy in their Situation than myself.  The appointment of General Smallwood was in the old State way.(3) I did not oppose it for Political Reasons but I took that opportunity of Delivering my Sentiments against those irregular and unrnilitary promotions and upon various occasions Since and am happy to find that There is now a Large majority of the House of my Sentiments so that I am Convinced There will be no more of those irregular appointments. Of Course General Clinton & General Knox will not be Superceeded. The Latter if Driven to resign would be an irreperable Loss to the Army.  I have conferred with a number of the most Confidential & most powerful members and have Secured their Interest-so far as to assure me that the Event which your Excellency apprehended can never take Place.  As I have been fortunate Enough to Disswade a majority of the members from pursuing the old mode I expect Soon to be called upon to point out a new one Liable to no objections and here I confess I shall be at a Loss owing perhaps to my want of Capacity, or possibly to the Confusions of having one Large Army Composed of Thirteen Small ones & wish your Excellency would be so oblidging as to give me your Sentiments upon it and what you would wish to be the Rule of Promotion. To Rise Regimentally to the Rank of Captain and afterward in the Line of the State to a Colonel (which I take to be the Rule) admits of no great Difficulty, but the Rule has been Extended to Brigadiers & even to Major Generals. Now Let us Suppose that Major Generals are to be Created from the Eldest Brigadiers & the former Rule is to Stand good for promotions of Colonels to Brigrs, is not this a perpetual Bar to promotions of Colonels who belong to States which Supply but one or two Regiments? Colonels of Such States may of Course be compelled NOVEMBER 29, 1780  to Serve under a Brigadier who a few years before Served under them on Detachments &ca as Captains. I See but one way to remedy this Evil which is to Rise from Colonels in the Line of the Army. Perhaps there may be Consequences attending this which I am not able to Discover. I therefore wish to know your Excellencys Sentiments upon it.  Your Excellencys Letter refered to was read in Congress & is Reffered to General Ward, General Cornell & myself.(4) We Shall Report upon it without Delay & I hope agreable to Justice & Equity which I know is the Extent of your wishes upon this & Every other matter.

  Sir Philadelphia 30th. November 1780 I am obliged to your Excellency for your good opinion. I shall never be in danger of forfeiting it by mal-treating a civil officer.(1) Some of the Delegates of Virginia and New York hired the House in which we live; and it is altogether appropriated to the Accommodation of Mr Maddison, Mr Mott, Mr Sharp and myself. This morning I was hastily called home from my Duty in Congress. The house was enterd and beset by a deputy Sheriff and his Bailifs. Finding that they had no criminal process to execute, I forewarned them, at their peril, not to enter my Apartment or touch any of my Effects. I explaind our publick Characters, Priveledges and exclusive Right  NOVEMBER 30, 1780  to occupy that House; and immediately repaired to my Duty in Congress. The Officer tho' at Liberty, after the Caution, I had given him, to use his own Discretion, thought fit to follow and renew the Conversation; the purport of which, on my part, was no more than to recommend him to take Advice before he proceeded further: for he appeared to me to be ignorant of his Duty. Nothing then can be more untrue than that I offered him the Slightest Injury by word or Action. From a Complaint so destitute of Foundations, is it not to be suspected that this Attempt to execute a Process against Effects, of which neither the Officer nor any with him, appeard to have the least Knowledge, was calculated for the mischievous purpose of enciting disturbance and giving Affront?  Permit me, Sir, to add, that in my Opinion the Reasons for protecting, in all Nations, the Persons, Houses & Effects of foreign Ambassadours apply with at least equal Force to the Members who constitute the general Government of the united States. Shall their Apartments be intruded into, their papers be exposed, and their Effects seized in a civil Case too with which they have no Connection? Shall they be stripped of every Accommodation, and disqualified from pursuing the great Duties of their Mission? Shall there be no Redress but thro' a tedious Course of Law in which, at the Expence of their Independance, and of the Sovereignty represented in their persons, they must submit to be Suitors? It is easy to see that a Government thus constituted must be incompetent to the great Purposes of publick Safety.

However strange it may appear that the money & bills of exchange are not yet sent forward, I can assure you, it cannot Justly be charged to my inattention to public business, & particularly what concerns the State. This I believe will be allowed by the greatest Enemies I have in this place.  Calumny & detraction runs high in this Torifyed City, but I hope much good will come out of this Modern Nazareth as the General Assembly of the State are now sitting & have been for several weeks past, & appear to be determined to adopt vigorous measures, by filling their Continental line of the Army-furnishing the supplies recommended by Congress-together with many other good things among which is a spirited resolution for putting the new bills into Circulation. In a word, they appear to be disposed to do whatever is incumbent on them, for the public good.

  Dear Sir Decr. 5 1780. Your favor of Nov. 16th with a Gazette reached me yesterday. You suffered so much in your mind & Body when here that I will not send you any of the ill pictures which with various Signatures come daily on to our Table. I hope you will find much Satisfaction in the short Letter from Genl. Gates. Wemyss was a very valuable officer to the Enemy.  You may amuse yourself also as one of the medical Class by reading the Epistle of Rush to Shippen in which you will find the Writer has relieved himself a little upon me.(1) Shenstone's Benevolence made him wish that he could afford to have his Pockets picked frequently. I feel a portion of his Spirit operating upon me at this Time; When I see poor Rush swelled near unto Bursting. I cannot doubt but that he finds some Relief by throwing about his Slaver and Froth, therefore when it falls upon my Cloaths I slight the Injury because he finds so much Ease in his terrible Case.  I have said to some of you my Friends last Week that Mr. Adams had in a masterly & Independent stile defended the Resolves of March 18 against the opinions of Count de Vergennes.(2)  He showed that the true value of our Paper was its current Rate. That the public Faith which is said to be broken is a mutual Contract between the public and the Individuals who compose it, that either may break it, the Public by not paying the promisory Note when it has had an equivalent or the Individual by not giving that Equivalent when he takes the Note. That Government will wrong the Public by paying off Notes, current at 40 for 1, by 40 hard for 40 paper as much as if they paid 40 hard for 1 paper when the Emission was current at par.  He says no Distinction can be made between Frenchmen & other DECEMBER 5, 1780  Foreigners or between any Foreigner and native Citizens. That all Foreigners become temporary Citizens. That they made such Profits as to be able to lose 3 Ships in 5, and this he proves by the prices of purchases and Sales. That they run no more Risk of Sea & Enemy than the Natives did in Trade.  That France is as much benefitted by trading with us as we are by trading with her. That the merchants of England had much more due to them when Mass. called in a Currency at 7 ½ and that the King ever partial to his own Subjects in England against those in America would not have confirmed the Law of Mass: if both he & his Council had not thought it just in Regard to the British as well as wise in the Americans. That France will doubtless form the same Judgement upon the present measures when she is as fully informed. That he (Mr. A.) cannot attempt to persuade Congress to alter a Resolve the Wisdom and Justice of which has the fullest Approbation of his own Judgment and his most cordial Wishes for its Success; That as a plain and candid answer to a Question, he must say he thinks such Proceedings the only Way to gain & preserve Credit abroad because they discover Wisdom Justice & also Vigor in the American Governments.  I have injured his long Letter by these Extracts, but I give you and other friends some Satisfaction.  Yr. affectionate J.L.  MS not found; reprinted from \""Letters of James Lovell,\"" Essex Institute Historical Collections 13 (July 1876): 220-22.

The passage Lovell undoubtedly had in mind reads:  \""The honourable Mr. Lovell is entitled to your warmest gratitude for the zeal with which he screened you from justice. When I told him that you had transported the wine which you claimed as your own, in public waggons, I well remember that he said, that 'this was practiced by all the staff officers of the army'; and added that ' men who handled public money, from the beginning of the world to the present day, were constantly envied.\""'  (2) See Lovell's letters to Abigail Adams and to Elbridge Gerry, November 30, 1780.

  Dear Sir. Philada. Decr. 5th. 1780 I had yours of the 25th Ulto. by yesterdays post.(1) I congratulate you on the deliverance of our Country from the distresses of actual invasion. If any unusual forbearance has been shewn by the British Commanders, it has proceeded rather I presume from a possibility that they may some time or other in the course of the war repossess what they have now abandoned than from a real disposition to spare. The proceedings of the Enemy to the Southward prove that no general change of system has taken place in their military policy.  We had letters yesterday from Mr. Jay & Mr. Carmichael as late as the 4 & 9th of September.(2) Mr. Jay informs us that it is absolutely necessary to cease drawing bills on him; that 150,000 d'rs. to be repd. in three years with some aid in Cloathing &c is all that the Court will advan[ce] for us. The general tenor of the letters is that our affairs there make little progress, that the Court is rather backward, that the navigation of the Mississippi is likely to prove a very serious DECEMBER 5, 1780  difficulty, that Spain has herself been endeavoring to borrow a large sum in France on which she meant to issue a paper currency, that the terms & means used by her displeased Mr. Necker who in consequence threw such discouragements on it, as in turn were not very pleasing to the Spanish Minister, that Mr. Cumberland is still at Madrid labouring in concert with other Secret Emissaries of Britain to give unfavorable impressions of our Affairs, that he is permitted to keep up a correspondence by his Couriers with London,(3) that if negociations for peace should be instituted this winter, as Spain has not yet taken a decided part with regard to America England will probably chuse to make Madrid rather than Versailles the seat of it. However unfavorable many of these particulars may appear, it is the concurrent representation of the above Ministers that our disappointment of pecuniary succour at Madrid is to be imputed to the want of ability and not of inclination to supply us, that the steadiness of his Catholic Majesty is entirely confided in by the French Ambassador, and that the mysterious conduct of Mr. Cumberland and of the Court of Spain towards him, seems to excite no uneasiness in the Ambassador. The letters add that on the pressing remonstrances of France & Spain Portugal had agreed to shut her ports against English prizes, but that she persisted in her refusal to accede to the armed neutrality.  The receipt of the foregoing intelligence has awakened the attention of the Georgia Delegates to their motion of which I informed you particularly by Col. Grayson.(4) It has laid even since it was made undisturbed on the table. This morning is assigned for the consideration of it, and I expect it will without fail be taken up. I do not believe Congress will adopt it without the express concurrence of all the States immediately interested. Both my principles & my instructions will determine me to oppose it. Virga. & the United States in general are too deeply interested in the subject of controversy to give it up as long as there is a possibility of retaining it. And I have ever considered the mysterious & reserved behaviour of Spain, particularly her backwardness in the article of money as intended to alarm us into concessions rather than as the effect of a real indifference to our fate or to an alliance with us. I am very anxious notwithstanding to have an answer to my letter by Grayson.  We had a letter yesterday also from Mr. Adams who was at Amsterdam;(5) and Several others from him a few days before.(6) Searl who carried despatches relating to the object of Mr. Laurens' Mission had fortunately arrived; though Mr. Adams gives no very sanguine idea of a successful result. The news of the fate of the Quebec & Jamaica fleets, arrived in London pretty nearly about the same time and had a very material effect both on stocks & on ensurance.  Information from the W. Indies gives a tragical picture of the effects of the tempest. Martinique has suffered very considerably in their   Shipping and Seamen. The English have certainly lost the Ajax a ship of the line & 2 frigates stationed off St. Lucie to intercept the Martinique trade with almost the whole of their crews, and there is great reason to suppose that several others which are missing have shared the like fate. St. Lucie is entirely defaced. In Barbadoes scarce a house remains entire, and 1500 lives at least are lost. One of the largest Towns in Jamaica has been totally swept away and the island otherwise greatly damaged. The Spaniards too on Cuba have not escaped, and there is a report that their fleet on its way to Pensacola has been so disabled & dispersed, that the expedition is for the present frustrated. This morning's paper which I this moment looked into has I perceive [a more par]ticular acct. of the disaster in W. Indies than I had befo[re read but] the St. Lucie paper says nothing of the loss of the Ajax &. but only that they were driven to Sea. I am less confident as to the fact, though it might be intentionally omitted or not known there.  It is not without reluctance that I trust this to the conveyance by post. If I had less experienced his punctuality in our correspondance or knew of a better opportunity, I should act otherwise. As it is I consider the importance of your knowing the particulars from Spain as a ballance for the risk.  We have in Town at present several gentlemen of distinction from the French army, among them the Chev: de Chatteleux the 2d in comman[d] a man of sense, politeness & letters. the Viscompt de Noailles brother in law to the Marquis de la fayette, and Baron de Montesquieu grand son to the great Montesquieu.

  Dr Sr. Philada. Decr. 5th. 1780  I have your favor of the 27th ulto.(1) and congratulate you on the deliverance of our Country from the distresses of actual invasion. The spirit it has shewn on this occasion will I hope in some degree protect it from a second visit.  Congress yesterday received letters from Mr. Jay & Mr. Carmichael as late as the 4 & 9th of Sepr. The general tenor of them is that we are not to rely on much aid in the article of cash from Spain, her finances & credit being scarcely adequate to her own necessities, and that the B. emissaries are indefatigable in misrepresenting our affairs in that kingdom and in endeavouring to detach it from the war. The character however of the Catholic king for steadiness and probity, and the entire confidence of our allies in him, forbid any distrust on our part. Portugal on the pressing remonstrances of France & Spain has at length agreed to shut her ports agst. English prizes but still refuses to accede to the armed neutrality. Mr. Adams writes that the fate of the Quebec and Jamaica fleets arrived at London nearly about the same time and had a very serious effect on all ranks as well as on stocks and ensurance.  Our information from the W. Indies gives a melancholy picture of the effects of the late tempest. Martinique has suffered very considerably both in shipping & people. Not less than 600 houses have been destroyed in St. Vincents. The Spaniards in Cuba also have not escaped, and it is reported that their fleet on its way from the Havanna to Pensacola has been so disabled & dispersed as to defeat the expedition for the present. On the other side our Enemies have suffered severely. The Ajax a ship of the line and two frigates stationed off St. Lucei to intercept the Martinique trade are certainly lost with the greatest part if not the whole of their crews; and there is great reason to believe, that several other capital ships that have not been since heard of have shared the like fate. The Island of St. Lucie is totally defaced. In Barbadoes also scarce a house remains entire and 1500 persons at least have perished. One of the largest towns in Jamaica has been totally swept away and the island otherwise much damaged. The consequences of this calamity must afford a striking proof to G. Britain of her folly in shutting our ports against her W. India commerce and transferring the advantage of our friendship to her Enemies.  I am Dr. Sir yrs. sincerely, J. Madison Junr.  ""

  My dear General. Confidential Philadelphia 9th December 1780. I shou'd not so long have restrained the Expressions of a Heart flowing with the most affectionate and respectful Attachment if Care had not been taken to communicate our Intelligence officially. In the mean time I have never found it so necessary to devote my Attention to the publick business. Amidst pressing distresses it will give your Excellency pleasure to be assured that Congress have deliberated with unanimity, and decided with firmness; and that every thing within their power is nearly accomplished for vigorous Efforts in the Course of the next year. If the States will draw forth their Resources: If our Ally will seriously cooperate by assuming a naval Superiority in the American Sea: If we are seasonably furnished with the Cloathing, Arms and Ammunition which we have reason to expect; and obtain the Aid of money which we have once more attempted to borrow: If these Circumstances in any tolerable degree Combine, your Excellency will at last see a prospect, under the divine blessing of finishing the war with Glory. But it is obvious that we have many difficulties to encounter!  Government instead of possessing the Confidence and the Dignity necessary to enforce it's Councils, is surrounded by clamorous Creditors and insidious Speculators, and what is worse the Intemperance of our Friends conspires with the malice of our Enemies to render it odious. Congress may err: they are not exempt from State and personal prejudices; they are liable to be deceived; but nothing is more certain than that in the common Cause their Intentions are pure, their Zeal, their Cares, their pains, unbounded; and the Time will come, when if their measures are not admired they will be approved. Indeed, Sir, an honest and disinterested Patriot requires uncommon Fortitude to render himself responsible in an hour of such intollerable Licenciousness: those who place their Happiness in Reputation retire from a Theatre where, while they are torturd by publick distresses, they are in danger of disgrace! The Intreagues of Speculators are more and more alarming. Our paper  DECEMBER 9, 1780  money lately suffered a Convulsion, without any apparent Cause, which threatned its total dissolution. Not contented with the infinite Evils which they have entailed on their Country; they have practiced their Arts on the Cabinet of France; and with such Success that one of our ministers received a formal Intimation that the Chevalier de la Luzerne woud be instructed to remonstrate against the act of the 18h of March as a violation of publick faith, (1) and an Injury to the trading part of that nation which ought to be repaired. Mr. Adams has acquired Applause by a Memorial to Count de Vergennes on this Subject full of Good Sence and dignity. The Necessity and the Justice of that memorable System are vindicated by Reasons and Facts which force Conviction. The Capital Figure which the french factors made in drawing on the Depreciation and their avarice in striving to exact Specie for the nominal Sums of the Bills; when it is notorious that they raised the price of their Commodities in proportion to the current Exchange are exposed; and it is demonstrated that instead of suffering they greatly profited by that national Calamity. Nor is the proper Inference neglected that a Government capable, in a free Country, of executing a Plan so disgusting to the self interested, must possess unlimited Confidence, and be established on the firmest Basis. I am perswaded that this Seasonable Representation will remove every prejudice, and prevent the Effects of an Attempt big with Ruin!  Another great difficulty which embarrasses us is the absolute Dependance which we are compelled to place on the Exertions of the States individually. A failure in one may draw upon us insupportable distress. If the Supplies of provisions shoud be punctually furnished the transportation alone is an Expence of such magnitude that I never think of it but with anxiety, especially when we consider how deeply pecuniary Taxes are anticipated by Certificates in the hands of the Farmers. There is a remedy but whether we have a sufficient degree of publick Spirit to apply it can only be known by Experiment. Why shoud not the opulent contribute, the whole or a large proportion of their plate? Why shoud not the Farmer break in upon his Capital if his annual produce is incompetent. Nothing is clearer than that this woud be the truest OEconomy as a foundation woud be laid to terminate the war by a great and decisive effort. These are Resourses in the power of every Legislature, and I shall think them inexcuseable if, seeing the necessity to be so urgent, they shrink from the Burthen. A Duty on Imports, Exports and prizes will be strongly recommended by Congress, and if approved by the States, it must produce a considerable Revenue.(2)  We have made an Estimate of the national Expence for a year from next January. Except the Quarter master's branch it is tolerably accurate. I shoud be happy if our means to defray it were certain and adequate: but this is not to be relied on, unless we are effectually  roused by a Sense of our common danger, and the necessity of concluding with Glory and Expedition a war of devastation. Every liberal hand must be opened; every patriotic heart must be animated, every publick and private effort must be exerted to strengthen and support our Army, to give weight to our national Councils, and secure them obedience at home and reputation abroad. Without the first the Courage, Perseverance and military Accomplishments of our General must be frustrated: without the last it woud be madness to hope for Credit, Alliance or Respect from foreign Powers.  After a studied Contempt of the Power of our Enemy which has marked the progress of our Contest, too great a dependance on foreign Succour claims the Rank in our political Errors. I speak of the publick opinion, exempting Congress as I ought from a share in this folly. Charmed with a Revolution so friendly to the Rights of human nature, and so humbling to the Insolence of Brittain, the People were too apt to imagine that the Coffers of Europe woud be emptied into our Lap without reserve. But to say nothing of the Dutch experience has shewn that the Spaniards on whom we principally relied, are not to be moved by disinterested Considerations. That Cabinet does not imitate the French in Liberality. They view the Contiguity of those States to the Sourse of their Treasures, and their rising greatness, with a sufficient degree of Jealousy. They are cautious of our Alliance unless they can acquire solid advantages. They are courted by England and tempted by offers which tho' they cannot accept without sacrificing their Honour, their family compact, and the Esteem of the Northern powers; they yet seem to countenance as a mean to lead us to concessions of which we cannot think without Reluctance. On no other principle are Cumberland's residence at Madrid, or the dilatoriness which has accompanied the Treaty to be reconciled. With respect to a Loan, if their Inclination was ever so prompt, it appears to me either that their Funds are not productive; or that their OEconomy is even worse than our own. They might however interpose their Responsibility as they have already done for the bills which we have drawn, and for the Cloathing which they have supplied, and it woud afford us essential Relief. Those Hints will open another Field of Embarrassment, the Extent of which your Excellency will fully perceive.  I shall only add to the Catalogue that we have advice that Sir Henry Clinton has written to his Court for a strong Reinforcement, or leave to retire from his command; that he has received an Approbation of his Conduct in flatering Terms, and a promise of Support, and that orders are accordingly issued for raising a Regiment of Cavalry and nine of Infantry.  But while we are called upon to examine our own Circumstances with Candour least we shoud be deceived by a false Estimate, our Enemies, it is evident, do not repose on a bed of Roses. They continue   to be disturbed by the Spirit of Independance which pervades Ireland. The Commons of that Kingdom lately hesitated to agree to a duty, amounting to a prohibition, on raw Sugars from England. Yelverton their patriot declared that the Irish Trade shoud in all respects be upon a perfect equality with the British. He rejected the Idea of a disparity between the Sister Kingdoms with Contempt; and threatned the Courtiers that if they persisted in their opposition he woud put himself at the Head of the Associators and establish the Freedom of Commerce by Arms. This is an Argument which carries conviction. Strange that in Ireland it shoud be consistent with Loyalty and in America be branded with the Appellation of Rebellion, and under that absurd Idea serve to colour over every Species of Inhumanity and Vengeance!(3)  In the West Indies from the late destructive Hurricane, and on the Ocean by a train of capital losses, the Enemy have sufferd most severely and in the tenderest point, their Trade, the Sourse of their Wealth and Credit! Their internal dissentions, which instead of being extinguished are only smotherd by the Vigour which the temerity of Gordon threw into the scale of their Government, is a malady which hangs heavy upon their Administration. The Convention of the neutral maritime powers which has aimed a fatal blow at the Sovereignty of the british flag and the imminent danger of their being involved in a war with Russia, Denmark, Sweden and Holland if they persist in a Claim so odious, and of drawing down the Resentment of their own subjects and universal Contempt if they extinguish it: The late Insult offered them by Portugal in shutting their ports against their Ships of War and Prizes: The Impracticability of their raising more Troops in Germany: The favourable Light in which our Independance is viewed throughout Europe; and the evident Satisfaction it gives even the princes on whom they most relied to see the british Dominion, Commerce and naval Strength circumscribed: Their disappointment in not being able by the most disgraceful Sacrifices to detatch Spain from the War: Their failure in Ways and means the present year: the immensity of their national debt and current Expenditures: All those Circumstances combined with the necessity of renewing their Preparations to oppose the belligerent powers at the very moment they looked for submission from America are more than sufficient to form a Contrast between us and our Enemies by no means to our disadvantage; Nor does it seem presumptuous to think that if we endeavour to deserve the Blessing; Peace, Liberty and Independance must before long crown our Wishes.  I have drawn this Letter to an immoderate Length: ascribe it to a desire of possessing you of my own View of our publick Affairs as far as I am at Liberty.  I will only add that the Visit of the French Noblemen has given  pleasure. The Chevelier Chateliux particularly recommends himself by his agreeable manners and literary Accomplishments.(4) Be pleased to pay my most respectful Compliments to Mrs Washington. I was greatly mortified at her passing thro' this Town without my Knowledge as I wished to have done myself the Honour of attending her to Trenton.

I will not comment on the difficultys that hath attended this business.(1) Inclosed is a resolution of Congress appointing the Hone. Jonathan Arnold and Joseph Clark Esqr. or Either of them to be sighners of the said New Bills on the part of the United States.(2) I hope it will be agreable.  Colo. Palfrey late Paymaster Genl. to the Army sails on Tuesday next for France, to take upon himself his Consulship in that Kingdom agreable to his appointment.(3)  Congress hath for a considerable time past been principally imployed in foreign affairs which are Called secret.(4)  It appears by a Cork paper of the 6th of Octr. last that the Hone Henry Lawrens was Commited to the Tower of London on suspicion of High Treason by the High Constable in Consequence of a Warrant Signed by Lords North, Stormont & Germaine.  The want of Money for publick use and the distress ariseing from that source is beyound the power of my pen to discribe And the prospect of releif appears small. Notwithstanding the Loan offices are kept open and Certificates given for a Silver dollar with Interest untill paid, upon the recept of Forty Continental dollars, yet so low is publick credit that not one farthing is receivd, in any of the Middle States.  From which I think there is little prospect that our state can receive any relief on account of any former advancements of money for the use of the United States. You will plese to pardon me for once more mentioning the Necessity there is of sending to your Delegates in Congress the Exact amount of the Moneys advanced to Colo. Bowen D QM Genl. As it doth not appear to me there is the least probability of obtaining that sum any other way then from the four tenths of DECEMBER 10, 1780  the New Bills now to be Issued by a Warrant from Congress on Mr. Clarke for that sum if this should fail I know not what funds you can have recourse to for payment. When I see you I shall be able to explain this matter more fully.  I have not received a word of Intelegence from any person in the state since your of the 31st of Octor.5 and Mr. Clarks of the 1st of Novr.

Well the Philistines have been upon you and you are rid of them. I congratulate you. Does there now need any Rhetoric to convince our Countrymen that the best thing they can do is to oppose their Enemy at a distance from them-and at the same time to make use of the respite they have to arrange and Organize their Militia, to repell them when attacked at home? Cannot this Maxim be inculcated into all ranks of Men that weakness is a temptation for strength to exercise itself upon-shall we ever be found unguarded, and will no experience teach us to be armed, ie to have a Competent number of men in the field during the War-Sat Verbum.  The Confederacy of the neutral Maritime Powers is at length Compleat. Portugal has at last acceeded to it. Catharine of Russia has astonishd all Europe with this stroke of Policy-by which she has put a Bridle on the ungoverned ambition of Britian to be the lord of the Ocean, and checked the hasty Strides of her Rival Power to Lord it over that Element.

That nine Sail of the line and a number of Transports, With 4000 Troops, would Sail from Brest in a day or two, destined to reinforce Admiral Ternay.

Measures for Sending Commissioners from G B to treat with Congress, is under Consideration of the privy Council, And it is thought would be adopted.

England hath not yet Compleated her last years Loan. All the powers will find it difficult to procure money to Carry on the War. France hath allready begun to Tax, and it is probable must Continue to do so.

General Baileys reasoning is Truly ridiculous. He thinks that a People who could Join the Enemy upon a mere Suspicion that Congress might give Judgement against them would at once Loose both the power & Inclination by its being reduced to a Certainty & Judgment proclaimed against them, This kind of reasoning is too Triffling to merit a Serious Answer. I am Sensible of the Disadvantages you mention which have Long been felt by our State and am happy that under all those Disadvantages New Hampshire has preferred the publick good to Every other Consideration. This as well as the whole of her Political Conduct must do her the highest Honor.  I Lament Exceedingly the Deranged State of our Finances & the Distresses of the People & have the pleasure to assure you that Measures are now adopted, which I am Convinced will afford the necessary relief but as order cannot succeed Confusion in a moment, Patience and perseverance Must Still be kept in Action. An Envoy Extraordinary is appointed to proceed to France for Supplies of money, Cloathing &ca back[ed] by the French Ambassador & all the French Gentlemens Interest & I doubt not of its being obtained.(4) We have another Plan of Finance nearly Compleated which in my opinion will give great & Speedy relief & I trust the whole will be Soon Communicated to you officially & I Trust will receive your approbation. My Time or Paper will not permit me to give you a proper Idea of it in this Letter.(5) I Expect Hourly Cloathing to arrive Sufficient for the whole Army which will relieve you from Some of your present Embarrassments.  The present is a time for the Tryal of Publick virtue & am happy in thinking with [you] that the Patriotic Sons of New Hampshire [will] not be behind hand with any; nay that they will according to Custom be the most forward in their Exertions for the Publick good.

  Sir, Philadelphia Decr. 12th. 1780 The inclosed extracts appear to us sufficiently interesting to induce us to forward them to you.(1) The reiterated information we have lately received from different quarters leave little room to doubt, that the DECEMBER 12, 1780  Southern States, will be the grand theatre of war this ensuing winter and spring.  The Waggons with stores for the army under your command, with two Companies of Artificers, are now on their way to join you.  Nothing has been as yet done to supply your troops with cloathing. Capt. Jones had sailed with the cloathing, but being dismasted a few days after he got to Sea, was obliged to put back to be refitted. By a letter received yesterday from Mr. Williams at Nantz; he informs us, that the Vessels will be ready to sail again in a few days.(2) They will have on board, made and materials sufficient for making, 20,000 suits of cloaths, with some hats, stockings, shirts, Overalls, Shoes, & Stocks and barrels & locks, for 20,000 muskets, & 100 Tons of Saltpetre.  The article of intelligence contained in the inclosed extracts respecting Portugal, seems to be pritty well [sustained?] by subsequent advices.  We have received no late intelligence of the enemies movements at New York. They appear to be quiet at present.  We are sir, with much respect & Esteem, Yr. most Obedt. Servts.

  Dear Sir Philada. Decr. 12th. 1780 Agreeable to your favor of the 2d instt.(1) which came to hand yesterday I shall send this to Fredericksbg. I am sorry that either your own health or that of your lady should oblige you to leave the legislature before the principal business of the Session is finished. I shall be still more sorry if either of these causes should disappoint my hopes of your return to Philada. at the promised time.(2) I am the more anxious for your return because I suppose it will supersede the proposed measure of sending an envoy to Congress on the business you mention.(3) If the facts are transmitted by the Speaker of the Assembly or the Executive, may they not be laid before Congress with as much efficacy by the established representatives of the State as by a special messenger? and will not the latter mode in some measure imply a distrust in the former one, and lower us in the eyes of Congress & the public? The application to the Ct. of France has been anticipated. Congress have even gone so far as to appoint an Envoy Extraordinary to Solicit the necessary aids. Col. Laurens was invested yesterday with that office.(4) I leave the measure to your own reflection. How far it may be expedient to urge Spain to assist us before she is convinced of the reasonableness of our pretensions, ought to be well weighed before it be tried. The liberty we took in drawing on her for money excited no small astonishment, and probably gave an idea of our distress, which confirmed her hopes of concession on our part. Accts. rcd. since my last repeat her inflexibility with regd. to the object in question between us. It is indispensable that we should in some way or other know the Ultimate sense of our Constituents on this important matter.(5) Mr. Laurens is certainly in captivity. An Irish paper tells us he was committed to the tower on the sixth of Octr. under a warrant from the three Secretaries of State.(6) Portugal has acceded to the neutral league so far as to exclude the English from the privileges her armed vessels have heretofore enjoyed in her ports. The Ariel with P. Jones & the cloathing &c. on board was dismasted a day or two after she sail'd & obliged to put back into port.(7) If G. Washington detaches no further aid to the Southwd. it will be owing to the reduction of his force by the expiration of enlistments. The Pennsylvania line is mostly engaged for the war and will soon form almost the whole of the army under his immediate command.  Mr. Sartine, it seems has been lately removed from the DECEMBER 12, 1780  administration of the naval department; in consequence of his disappointing the general hopes formed from the great means put into his hands. When it was mentioned to me by Mr. M _____s.(8) I took occasion to ask whether the deception with regard to the 2d division ought to be ultimately charged upon him, observing to him the use the Enemies of the Alliance had made of that circumstance. From the explanation that was given I believe the blame rests upon his head, and that his removal was the effect of it in a great measure; though it is possible he may like many others have been sacrificed to ideas of policy, and particularly in order to cancel the unfavorable impression which the disappointment left on America. A high character is given as might be expected of his successor the Marquis de Caster,(9) particularly with respect to those qualities in which Mr. Sartine is charged with having been most deficient.

  Dear Sir, . Philada. Decemr. [12] (1) 1780  I had the pleasure of yours of the 2d (2) instant yesterday. We have not heard a word of the fleet which lately left Cheasapeake. There is little doubt that the whole of it has gone to the Southward.  Our intelligence from Europe confirms the accession of Portugal to the Neutral league; so far at least as to exclude the English from the privileges which their Vessels of War have hitherto enjoyed in her ports. The Ariel commanded by P. Jones which had on board the cloathing &c. which has been long expected from France was dismasted a few days after she sailed and obliged to return into port; an event which must prolong the sufferings which our army has been exposed to from the delay of this supply. Mr. Sartine, the Minister of the french Marine has been lately removed from the admi[ni]stration of that departmt. His successor is the Marquis de Caster, who is held out to us as a man of greater activity & from whom we may hope for more effectual co-operation.  An Irish paper informs us that Mr. Laurens was committed to the Tower on the 6th of Octr. by the three Secretaries of State on suspicion of high treason. As the Warrant with the names of the Secretaries subscribed (with some other particulars) is inserted, no hope remains of the fact being a forgery.

Anderson found among the dead letters in the post office and communicated to Congress by the Postmaster. If there should be occasion for the original of the letter it shall be transmitted on the first intimation.(3) An Irish paper informs us that Henry Laurens Esquire was committed to the Tower on the 6th of October by a warrant from the Secretarys of State on suspicion of High Treason. All the despatches entrusted to the same conveyance unfortunately fell into the hands of the Enemy at the same time.  A letter from Mr. Jonathan Williams dated at Nantz, Octr. 17 confirms an account received several days ago, of the Ariel commanded by P. Jones, Esqr. & containing cloathing &c for the Army being dismasted & obliged to return into port. The effect of this delay will be severly felt by the troops who have already but too much reason to complain of the sufferings they have been exposed to from a want of these necessaries.  The same letter from Mr. Williams as well as some others received within a few days give us reason to believe that Portugal has at length yielded to the solicitations of the Neutral Powers & to the remonstrances of France & Spain so far as to accede to the general object of the former and to exclude the English from the privileges which their vessels of War heretofore enjoyed in their ports.

I am in hopes this will reach you at Headquarters, where I have been long anxious for your arrival, that we might have your opinion of the true state of our affairs there.

Their destination is not known. Arnold's having the command, induces some to think that it is only a plundering party, but in my opinion, it is too formidable for such an errand.

  Sir Philadelphia December 13th. 1780  The complexion of the intelligence received of late from Spain, with the manner of thinking which begins to prevail in Congress with regard to the claims to the navigation of the Mississippi, makes it our duty to apply to our constituents for their precise full and ultimate sense on this point.(1) If Spain should make a relinquishment of the navigation of that river on the part of the United States an indispensable condition of an Alliance with them, and the State of Virginia should adhere to their former determination to insist on the right of navigation, their delegates ought to be so instructed not only for their own satisfaction, but that they may the more effectually obviate arguments drawn from a supposition that the change of circumstances which has taken place since the former instructions were given may have changed the opinion of Virginia with regard to the object of them. If on the other side any such change of opinion should have happened, and it is now the sense of the State that an Alliance with Spain ought to be purchased even at the price of such a cession if it cannot be obtained on better terms it is evidently necessary that we should be authorized to concur in it. It will also be expedient for the Legislature to instruct us in the most explicit terms whether any and what extent of territory on the East side of the Mississippi and within the limits of Virginia, is in any event to be yielded to Spain as the price of an Alliance with her. Lastly it is our earnest wish to know what steps it is the pleasure of our Constituents we should take in case we should be instructed in no event to concede the claims of Virginia either to territory or to the navigation of the above mentioned river and Congress should without their concurrence agree to such concession.

  Sir Philadelphia Decr. 14 1780 Your favour of the fourteenth Octor last was duly delivered, (1) & I am much obliged to you for the same, & am rejoiced to hear of your welfare, & that of your family.  You are pleased to mention with a note of admiration the merciful Interposition of Divine Providence, in the detection of Arnolds Traitrous Conspiracy. It is really a very great mercy & I sincerely wish we may all be truly thankful therefor, not only in word, but in deed; & not only for that particular favour, but for the many undeserved interpositions of Divine Providence in our behalf, through the whole course of the present war. May we not truly say that, this war has been attended with as signal favours almost, as attended Gods anoint[ed] people? If we take an impartial retrospective view Thereof, shall we not have true reason to be astonished at the many remarkable deli[verances] which have been wrought out for us? I have observed from the beginning of the war to the present Period, that when we were weakest & the most exposed the greatest things have been accomplished, and when we have to the human eye appeared, to be in the best Situation, and the fairest prospect before us, the least has been done. And those men & things in which we have placed great confidence, have rendered us but little Service.  I readily concur with you in Opinion, that it is of importance that men in power and high places of trust should be watched. I am also of opinion it is of the highest importance that those who have a right to elect into office or places of trust, should be more careful to make choice of honest, sensible, religious men than they commonly are. They ought to avoid that man who will not shake his hands from holding of bribes, as they would their greatest adversary. And that man who makes a mock of all religion & ridacules every thing of a Serious nature is one in my opinion who ought to be carefully shuned & avoided. Towns and Counties making a bad choice of Representatives, will be a means of bad delegates in Congress being chosen, & bad delegates in Congress will also make bad appointments  DECEMBER 15, 1780  of men to the offices that they have a right to fill with officers! From hence appears that each town or County has a share in every appointment, immediately from the highest to the lowest officer, &, that a bad choice of Representatives leads to a bad choice of a General officer. From this view of the matter also appears the importance of towns and Societys being well instructed in their duty in this respect.  ""

  Sir, Philad., 16 Decem., 1780. The Sherif some days since handed me a Letter as from your Excellency but unsigned. (1) It was nevertheless treated with all the Respect which was possible, and the Sherif was left at Liberty to examine every Apartment without Interruption. He was only told that the House was our possession, and that in the first Instance it must be presumed in Law that the goods belonged to the Occupants, that the bare assertion of the Defendant Bulkly coud be no proof to the Contrary, that there were beside interfering claims, and that he ought to call a jury to ascertain the property, for his own justification and to avoid oppression; and that otherwise he must proceed at his peril. This Remonstrance having no Effect the House  DECEMBER 16, 1780  was abandoned to his discretion, and he completed his Inventory according to Bulkly's direction.  On his principles we do not see what should restrain him from entering the House even of the Chief Magistrate and inventorying and selling his Effects, if Bulkly woud attend and affirm that he claims them as his own.  The Judgement is understood on all hands to be collusive. The Sherif himself seems to be of that opinion: but there is no Court of Chancery to detect the fraud: and this in a Case where the Remedy woud be certain, for Mr. Dickenson is a judgement Creditor of long standing, and from mere Charity has withheld his Execution. Mr. Howel is also a Creditor. Even independant of these Considerations if Bulkly coud strip the House of all he might possibly claim in right of marriage, it woud be of very little benefit to him, nor woud it incommode us: the Chief of the furniture belonging to Mr Jones an absent Delegate of Virginia, Mr Howel, Mrs Prid and another Relation of the family. These are represented to us as Facts, and we think ourselves bound to lay them before your Excellency from motives of Humanity as well as Justice; and because it woud, to say no more be unreasonable that we shoud suffer very great Inconveniencies which even the Rigour of Law does not require and a Court of Equity woud prevent.  On the whole we shall be perfectly satisfied if the Sherif conducts himself by the Opinion of the Attorney General who is a publick officer. The station in which we are placed and the Circumstances of the Case seem to point it out as proper. Delicacy alone forbids us to trouble your Excellency, or we shoud request the favour of your Direction.(2)  I have the Honour to be with the greatest Respect Sir, your Excellency's most obedient & very humble Servant,  Jas.

  Dr Sir Philadelphia Dec. 16. 1780 I have written twice to Mr Houston since I came here, (1) but believe I have been unlucky in the Manner of Conveyance. The first was written a Week ago to go by a private Hand & I am uncertain whether it has gone yet. The other I am told went yesterday by Mr Chalmers of Trenton. Referring to it for what else it contains I shall send you again a Copy of a Resolution recommended by a convention that met at Hartford consisting of the New England States & N. York- resolved that the Commander in cheif of the Army of the united States be authorised & empowered to take such Measures as he may deem proper & the public Service may render necessary to indxe the several States to a punctual Compliance with the Regulations which have been or may be made by Congress for Supplies for the Years 1780 & 1781.(2) Tho it is well known to you that few Persons have a higher opinion of or Confidence in Gen. Washington than my self or a greater Desire of having vigorous executive Powers put in the Hands of Persons at the Head of Affairs either in the military or civil Department yet that Resolution is of such a Nature that I should never give my Voice for it unless You my Constituents should specifically direct it perhaps even not then & indeed I have that Opinion of Gen. Washington that I do not think he would accept or act in Consequence of such Powers. What could induce that Convention to recommend such a Measure is a Mystery to me but I believe it will have few advocates.  Congress has unanimously resolved to send an Envoy to the Court of Petersburg [al Measure they agreed to on two Accounts first because all their foreign Ministers recommended it and secondly DECEMBER 16, 1780  because it is very plain that the Court of Petersburg [will?] have very great Influence on the present War & probably at the Termination of [it prescri]be the Terms to France & England. The Person in all Probability will be Mr Dana bcause he is at present in Holland & may proceed there with little additional Expence.(3) A Committee of three of which I am a Member (& who by a partial Report occasioned the above Measure) have further agreed to report on Monday that the Sense of the House be taken whether Dr Franklin shall be continued at Paris or not.(4) I know no Secresy to which this Purpose is intitled & yet as the Report has not been made it may not be so proper to tell it generally in the Words above written which [thus is] referred to your Prudence. Great indeed has been the Negligence or Corruption of some Persons in France for it is certain that Clothing sufficient to have made the whole Army comfortable has been in L Orient & other Sea ports since March [or April] last & yet little of it has been sent over. To enquire into this Neglect is one of the objects of the above Committee.  Congress had resolved before I came to Town to send an Envoy extraordinary to the Court of France for the Special Purpose of Soliciting & forwarding the Supplies [a] Measure which appeared to me very unnecessary & expensive but if the old Gentleman should be recalled it may do well enough as that Envoy will supply the Place of a Minister Plenipotentiary till another is appointed. The [Person] chosen is Col. Laurence Mr President Laurens's Son. He seems to make [no] difficulty of accepting. If he should finally refuse I suppose [. . .] the [. . .] be chosen will be Col. Hamilton Gen. Washingtons Aid to whom I have no other objection but his Youth which also militates against the other.  There has been a Report circulated of the English being about sending new commissioners or offering new Terms. If there be any Thing certain in this, you will know it better than we can for it must have come from New York; but I suspect it has arisen from a Letter Congress has received from the secretary of the Embassy in Spain which says only that the Spanish Court has received Intelligence from London that the English Court had such a Thing in Contemplation & that it was to be determined on Such a Day in the privy Council. The authority is therefore very doubtful.(5) The Distress of our Finances is the most important & alarming Circumstance in our Situation. A Committee has it under Consideration but whether their Measures will be radical & effectual it is impossible to say. My Opinion is that Relief must come from the particular States & they must do it by giving up Attachment to Paper Money & by Loans & Contracts being in the Credit of individuals to assist the Public. This is the Case in England for all their taxes would be too late, if Monied Men did not Step forth & advance in the meantime what was necessary. I am assured that one of the late   Delegates of Virginia [is gone?] Home (6) with his own Eyes open & a full Purpose to endeavour to persuade [ . . . ] of that State in a great Measure to relinqish their absurd Claims & [. . .] Cessions of Land to the united States. If this should be the Case there will be an excellent Fund of Credit. I am sorry to say that a family there (7) was always a Party strong enough to prevent foreign Loans so now the Prospect of obtaining them seems more dubious than ever.  This Morning or last night an Express arrived with a long Letter from Gov. Rutledge of So. Carolina to the Delegates of that State giving an Account of the position of the Forces on both sides & some little skirmishes. The English have a Post at Camden well fortified & a pretty considerable Garrison in it, another Post at 96, another at Augusta. Lord Cornwallis with the principal force supposed about 10,000 the east side of broad River within I think about 40 Miles of Charlestown. Our forces are in a good many different Bodies round them, Sumpter lower down than they & nearer Charlestown. There is an authentic Account by a Letter from Col. Marrian of his having surprised with 150 Men a Party of the English of 200 in which Encounter about 14 or 15 were killed, between 20 & 30 taken Prisoner & I believe 80 Horses with a considerable Quantity of Arms & Baggage. The Governor also says there was a Report which gained considerable Credit though no Official Accounts have come that Col. Tarlton had attacked Sumpter & was repulsed with great Loss though they did not know the number as they carried off their Dead, that Tarlton himself was mortally wounded & Sumpter our Commander wounded in the Arm but not dangerously & that Sumpter who is a very watchful Officer had learned they were coming against him in great Force & retired some further up the River. Gen. Green had not arrived but was daily looked for. A Colonel (not named) & some Justices had dismissed a great many of the Tories taken on Kings Mountain on their giving Bail for their Appearance at Court & put the Officers on Parole. The Officers broke their Parole & run off & many of the privates again joined the Enemy.  I should be glad to know what our Council & Assembly have done respecting the Supply of the Army & to see the Votes of the Assembly.  The Exchange of Money here is nominally 75 really 100 at least, for hard money itself cannot be bought at less than 100 if for that and the merchants have raised their Goods 25 per cent universally so that what is called the hard money Price at the Exchange is so much advanced as to answer the same purpose as raising the Exchange.  Your Excellency may shew this Letter as it is to the Vice President, (8) Mr Houston & Dr Scudder. To others I would rather you should communicate what news may be in it in your own Words. I am your Excellencies most obedt., humble Servant,  Jno Witherspoon  ""

  My dear Sir Philada Decr 17. 1780 I have written several Letters to you & Mr D since the 28th of June when I last arrivd in this City.(1) I think I committed one to the Care of our Friend Mr Laurens, who is unfortunately carried to England. Mr Palfrey, who is the Bearer of this, is appointed Consul in France; and besides his Consular Functions, he has it in Charge to forward such Cloathing, Arms &c as are or may be procured there for the Use of our Troops. Great Exertions have been made the year past, in which old Massachusetts has borne her full Share, to be in Readiness to cooperate with our Ally, in an Attempt to give our Invaders a decisive Blow. But the second Division of the french Squadron being blocked up in Brest, & a Reinforcement to the Enemy arriving from the West Indies, they have had the Superiority at Sea. This was not our only Misfortune; for had the whole naval Force arrivd which we expected, I am inclind to believe we should have faild for Want of a Sufficiency of Powder. By an unpardonable Neglect in some body, that essential Article was not sent, as it ought to have been, in Season. I have called it an unpardonable Neglect. It appears so to me. My Judgment, however, may be too severe.  DECEMBER 17, 1780  I confess, I feel much chagrind, while I think that any thing has been omitted, which might have been done, to have finishd the War with a glorious Campaign. But Disappointments, tho vexatious, ought not to disconcert us. They do not. No Difficulties should discourage us in the Support of a Cause, so righteous in the Sight of Heaven as I believe ours to be, and so interresting to Mankind. Our Creator has given us Understanding, Strength of Body and a Country full of Provisions. We must make a good Use of them, hoping that His Blessing will crown our virtuous Struggle. He helps those who make proper Exertions to help themselves. Such Exertions are now making. The States are called upon for an Army of 35,000 Men; and from past Experience of the great Expence; as well as Inutility of temporary Drafts, they are resolvd to have a well appointed Army early in the Field & inlisted for the War. And effectual Measures are taken for the Purpose of providing Magazines in Season for its Subsistence. The People at large, as far as I can learn, are as determind as ever to support their Independence, & for that End to carry on the War with Vigor. If our Ally can furnish us with a decided naval Superiority, I think there will be the fairest Prospect of bringing this great Contest to a happy Conclusion the next year. Altho' the Enemy have gaind the Possession of Charlestown, they have not succeeded to their Wishes in that Quarter. They do not find the People so pliable as they flatterd themselves they should. Notwithstanding Cornwallis's boasting Letter to Lord George of \"" a compleat Victory obtaind the 16th Instant by His Majesties Troops under my Command, over the rebel southern Army,\"" that brave Army checkd the Progress of the Troops under his Command on the 16th of August; (2) and the Militia have since, in several Instances, given him ample Proofs of a firm Attachment to the publick Cause, as well as Bravery and Alertness which he did not expect, and which I beleive have disconcerted their general Plan. The Hands of those People, if not already, will very soon be taught to war & their Fingers to fight.  Arnolds Conspiracy was to have wrought Wonders but gracious Heaven defeated it. We have so often seen in the Course of this Conflict, the remarkable Interpositions of divine Providence in our favor, as to convince me, that the Attempts of our Enemies to subdue us, will be but gnawing a File.  Your publick Letters have been well receivd. I have been favord with only two from you since you left Boston.(3) One was deliverd to me by my worthy patriotick Friend Mr A Lee, & the other by the ViCount de Noailles, who lately spent a few Days in this City. He appears to be a most amiable young Nobleman; & I believe you have not said too much in the great Character you have given him. The very short time he stayed here & the Business I have been engagd in, prevented me the Honor, which I very much covetted, of conversing with him frequently.  Congress have appointed Colo John Laurens Envoy extraordinary at the Court of Versailes, & Mr Dana will be regularly informd that he is to go to Russia.  Before I conclude I must let you know, that the Ship which was set up in Massachusetts while you was there, and which, it was proposd, should be named, the Oceana, has since been compleatly finishd and is now afloat. Her Materials are acknowledgd to be of the best kind, & well put together.(4) It is said she will make a prime Sailor if not too taunt masted. Others say, that the Construction of her Hull is such as to require a lofty Sail. There are many Speculations about her. As I am not a Judge in the Matter, I am prudently silent & hear the opinions of those who are Commissioners. All agree that her owners have much at Stake, & that [it] will be a very great oversight in them if they should ever risque her with unskilfull or unprincipled Officers or Pilots.  My due Regards to Mr Dana, & be assured that I am very cordially his & your Friend, S A.  ""

  Sir, Philadelphia December 18. 1780  Since writing my Letter of the 6th of October last (1) (a Copy of which is enclosed) I have been honored with yours of July 10th & September 16th; (2) by the latter I am happy to find that we may expect soon to receive further & more particular Intelligence from you.  Congress, it is probable, will soon establish an Office for foreign Affairs, to be managed by an Officer stiled Secretary for foreign Affairs, who will be constantly devoted to the Business of that Department, which it is to be hoped will remedy many Disadvantages we have hitherto laboured under, and give our Ministers at foreign Courts more frequent, better & earlier Intelligence than they have hitherto received from us.  In the Course of the last Campaign the Enemy at New York have been pretty much confined under the Protection of their Ships and Fortifications. The Particulars of their Eruption into the Jerseys under Kniphausen, and the repulse they met with, you must have been informed of before this.  The Enemy from Canada have repeatedly attacked the western & northern Frontiers of New York, by the Way of the Mowhawk river and Lake Champlain, marking their route with their usual Devastation, but were soon compelled to retreat with Precipitation.  Since the unfortunate Action near Camden and retreat of General Gates, our People, principally Militia of the Southern States, have been frequently skirmishing successfully with the Enemy, and have driven in most of their out Posts. The brilliant Success of the Militia over Colonel Ferguson at Kings Mountain, you must have learnt from the Papers. The Enemy from the last Intelligence were in Possession of Camden and some other inland Posts in South Carolina. Should they not be reinforced soon, it is probable they must have recourse to their old Practice of retiring to the Sea Coast under the Protection of their Shipping. General Greene by Order of Congress hath taken Command of the southern Army, which will be reinforced so as to make a respectable Army in the Course of the Winter. We are waiting and wishing for a naval Force to command the American Seas; and with the Smiles of Providence might soon expect in that Case to expell the Enemy from the United States.  Necessity obliges me to confide in the Committee for foreign Affairs to give you the needful and more particular Intelligence.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia Decemr. 18th. 1780. My letter of Novemr. 8th. 1779 (1) by John Lowell Esquire in answer to your favor of the 20th Septemr preceding, did not, I fear, get to hand previous to your departure from Boston. However I hope you have received it.  Congress have a few days ago appointed Colo. Palfrey, late Paymaster General to be Consul for the United States in France, with considerable powers over their commercial business in particular to forward all supplies for the army; which have been hitherto unaccountably delayed and neglected. Young Colo. Laurens is also just appointed Envoy Extraordinary to the Court of Versailles, with a view to sollicit a loan of about a million Sterling, and additional naval aids, from our great & good Ally His Most Christian Majesty. I wish them success, tho' I fear we have not fallen upon the most likely way of obtaining the loan; the appointment of an Envoy on this occasion seems to imply a want of confidence in our Minister's attention, abilities or something else; however I hope it may not be construed in that light, but rather considered as an evidence of our earnestness in the business.  We seem now to be carrying on a war of finance; the States are therefore jointly and severally entering into it with great zeal, and I do not fear but we shall get the better of our enemies even in this sort of contest. We have a great plenty of every thing but specie, & military stores. We can readily furnish them with provisions & pay and are pretty well stored with arms & ammunition; cloathing is our principal want. Our friends abroad must assist us with some money and clothes.  Since General Gates's disappointment at Cambden (owing to the then inexperience of the Militia in that Country) our affairs to the Southward wear a more favorable aspect. The Militia afterwards became ashamed, grew almost desperate, and have beaten the Enemy where ever they met them; with equal numbers they attacked a Body of near 1200 under Colo. Ferguson at Kings-Mountain, killed the Colonel and about 250 more & took all the rest prisoners, except about 15, or 20 at the most; Major Weymiss of the British Horse was wounded & taken prisoner, together with 25 of his cavalry, and a number killed, by a party under Brigadier General Sumpter of the Militia of South Carolina; who have since that, it is just reported and believed, attacked Colo. Tarlton's Legion, mortally wounded DECEMBER 18, 1780  the Colonel, killed near 100 and taken 112 prisoners. All is quiet in the neighbourhood of New-York. The Enemy seem to bend their whole attention and force to the Southward. They had detached 2000 men to Portsmouth in Virginia under General A. Lesley, with a view of forming a junction with Lord Cornwallis; but being totally deceived in that expectation, after staying in that neighbourhood upwards of three weeks, making a small fortification there, burning some churches & dwelling houses according to their custom, they reembarked on the 23d last month, intending it is supposed for Cape Fear in North Carolina, but we have as yet no certain accounts of their landing. So much for news. You should have more, but the Bearer, Mr. John Benezet, (2) purposing to sail early tomorrow morning prevents it.  Permit me, Sir, to introduce this Gentlemen to your acquaintance. He proposes to reside for some time in France, as a Merchant; he is one of a considerable House here, has been a staunch Whig from the first dawn of the contest, and has always bore the character of a sensible & polite Gentleman.  I am, dear Sir, Your most obedient & very humble servant,  [P.S.] Be so good as to present my very respectful compliments to Mr. Dana.  ""

  Sir Philadelphia 18 Decr. 1780 The Most Material Matters which have been transacted in Congress Since my Arrival (1) has been an Appointment of an Envoy to the Court of France, and a Vote to Send a Minister to the Court of Russia. The Expediency of Sending an Envoy to the Court of France was much doubted of by a Number of Gentlemen-As Nothing was proposed to be transacted of that particularity and Importance but what might properly be done by our Residentiary Minister at that Court. That the Measure might excite wrong and Very improper Apprehensions. That it might be understood by Dr Franklin and the World in general as wearing an Appearance unfavourable to his Character, which while he was in so Important an Office Prudence as well as Justice Oblidged us to Support. That instead of an Envoy Our Minister in France ought to have the Aid of an Active intelligent Secretary, an Aid which every other Minaster in less important Service had been furnished with. But upon a Division it was carryed And Col Laurens a Gentleman it is Said of real Abilities is charged with this Commission. The Vote to Send a Minister to Russia met but with little opposition upon the Consideration of the Influence of that Court upon the General Affairs of Europe and as paying a Respect to a Princiss of the greatest Dignity. Mr Dana may probably be Sent to that Court.(2) Mr J Adams is charged with the Commission which the late President Laurens was to Execute.(3)  Mr. Williams writes from France that the Reason why no more of the Cloathing has not been Sent has been owing to a Quarrel between Capt. Landais and Some of our other Officers.(4) The Occasion of this Delay will be enquired into. The Rest of the Supplies may probably soon be in America.  Mr. Vergennes wrote to Mr J Adams then in Paris with Regard to the Measure adopted by Congress for cancelling their Currency at a Discount, & Manifested Some Apprehensions he had, that Congress might not be able to Vindicate the Justice of the Measure. Mr. Adams I think returned a Very convincing Answer in which DECEMBER 18, 1780  in a particular Manner he Stated the true Principles upon which Congress proceeded, and in my Apprehension dearly shewed that Justice dictated the Measure. It is presumed that the Minister will be Satisfied with the Propriety of the Act. No unfavourable Symtoms Appear which indicate any Want of Cordiality in that Court. Your Excellency has probably heard that the Count de Sartine is removed from the Marine Department.(5) The Reasons for this are not known, it is Said that this Gentleman had no professional Acquaintance with Naval Affairs, and that the most perfect Amity had not Subsisted between him and the Count de Estaing.  We have pretty undoubted Information that Portugal has Acceded to the Plan of Neutrality proposed by Russia.  There is a very probable Account that Sr Harry Clinton has Sent to the British Court for Ten Thousand additional Troops or that he might be permitted to Return Home, that this Court have Signified to him their intire Approbation of his Conduct, and have it is Said determined to Send him the Succours asked for to carry on their Military Operations to the Southward.  By Accounts from the Southward We learn that our affairs there, are becoming more prosperous-Small Advantages are pritty frequently gained upon the Enemy. Lord Cornwallis Apprehends it Seems that he can put no Confidence in the People who have recd. his Protection, in this probably he is not Mistaken, this has induced him to Excercize a Most Severe Government over them, which has Occasioned Many of those People to join our Troops. Every Defection increases his Severity which has a proportionable Influence upon the People and as they will find the Government perfectly insupportable it is to be hoped that Exertions will be made by them adequate to repel the Violence which oppresses them.  Your Excellency has probably been informed that a rapid Depretiation of the old Bills had taken place in this Town, this Occasioned the Inhabitants to Meet, who paid the Discount at 75 for one-the immediate Consequence of this was an Advance of the Specie Price upon all Vendables-so that not the least Advantage has been derived from the Measure. The practical Discount is about one hundred for one. What seems to have been the immediate Cause of the Depretiation has been a Vast Influx of the Bills from the Southward. In S. Carolina & Georgia they can be but of little use, in N. Carolina who have not yet Adopted the Money System of Congress, they are Very low, but yet pass at twice the Value of a late State Emission which they have issued. In Virginia who it is said are issuing a State Emission the Depretiation is also Very great. This Occasions the Money to be brought here to Exchange or realize. These Causes will probably Continue to Operate for some Time as the old Money is but a Very little of it Yet cancelled, and a large part of Taxes paid in Certificates and State Emissions Made. I believe   there are none of the New Bills of Congress Emitted South of the Jersys. This State have put out a few of them and made them a Tender at 75 for one. Pensylvania are about to pass an Act relative to the New Money System. What will be the Ultimate Fate of the New Bills cannot be known absolutely but upon tryal. The State Emissions of Connecticut, Pensylvania and Maryland which were well funded now pass in the Relation to the old Bills one for forty. Bills of Exchange Sell here at 75 per Cent. I suppose this is nearly the Case in all the States. An Evidence that there is no high Demand for Specie for commercial Purposes Abroad-or that Bills of Exchange are plenty. I suppose that they must continue So while a French Fleet and Army are in this Country and while Congress at the same Time continue to draw upon their Commissioners in Europe. Upon those Principles But little Specie will go from Us except what Shall be clandestinely Sent to N York which will not probably be Very great, and which upon every Principle ought to be totally prevented. The large Expenditure of Specie by the French Army and Navy in the Country, and but Very little of it Sent Abroad will Rapidly Increase the Quantity-And may probably if continued but for even a Short Time produce a Redundancy especially, in the Northern States. That will be a Cause of Luxury, Dissipation and Injustice.  The Doings of the Convention who met at Hartford are in the Hands of a Committee.(6) The Object of Finance will come under Consideration. But the Effect of these Deliberations will probably be Slow and perhaps Unproductive. We have No Money in the Continental Chest-and have but a little Prospect of having it Supplied. As the Post is going out of Town shall only add that Since Writing the above Some Alteration has been made by Congress in the Slate of their New Ministers-And Mr Dana is appointed for Russia.(7) I am Your Excellencys Most Obedt. Servant,  Oliver Wolcott P.S. Before I close up my Letter I cannot but Express the Chagrin that almost every Man must feel on Reflecting that the old Bills which are fit but for little Else but to Make the Tail of a Paper Kite with at least their Value May not be worth more than 500,000 £ Sterling Should so extremely Imbarrass our Affairs, And that it seems to be an Evil which will probably continue for a long Time to Oppress Us in the way in which We are proceeding. Congress will consider the Object of Finance as a Very Delicate Affair as it truly is. Every one is interested in the Subject-And the Opinions of Mankind in Regard to it are Very different. To Do Justice to the Possessors of the Bills to Obviate the Misschief, which they Occasion and to Maintain the Honour and Reputation of the Publick in Regard to those Objects, are Difficulties of a peculiar Nature. Congress have been so much Criminated for what they have already done upon this  Head, that it Appears to Me they will depend upon the Efficacy of the Measures already Adopted, the Certainty of which is pritty precarious-when it is considered how little of the old Money is cancelled. How farr individual States may proceed in this Business I cannot Say-at present the War is and must be supported by an Exertion individually exerted.  As I have thot it my Duty to give your Excellency every Information in Regard to the general State of Affairs here and to the Southward-I could Wish that the present Oppertunety would have Allowed me Time to have Done it in a more Correct Manner.  Your Excellencys humble Servt. O Wolcott  [P.S.] Col Root's Son has the Small Pox and he tells Me he Shall not chuse to Write least possibly some Accident may happen.  ""

Congress is impressed with the necessity of Observing Oeconomy in the public expenses and having been formerly too profuse in the promotion of officers determined to stop their hand. They say N.

Before the reduction was agreed to I moved it, but found the subject disagreeable; since the rect. of your Letter I have Consulted such as I thought most in your favour and met with but little encouragement. We have had no recommendations for this measure either from the Genl., the Legislature, or even the brigade. You mention the promotion of Genl. <<Greene> Gist and Morgan, but their appointments were in consequence of requests from Maryland and Virginia. This cannot be offered in your favour.  DECEMBER 19, 1780  I see the Embarrassment the Subject is under; If I move an Appointment at present I shall fail in obtaining it; And if you leave the Service in Col.

  Decr. 19, 1780. I was unable on the last post day to thank you for yr. favor of Novr. 23d-then, thro' want of time-now, I am scarcely able thro' much Indisposition of Body to notice largely all the Points to which you expect my attention. As to Bermuda you seem to have conversed more with merchants who own Privateers than with Politicians who DECEMBER 19, 1780  know the great Portion of our friends in Bermuda above our Enemies a Portion which ought not to bc driven into the mode of fitting out Cruisers who would be as troublesome to us as they were to the french formerly. As to the Duck in the Agents hands orders have been given. As to the Resolve of Novr. 21/22 respecting our Delegation, Circumstances at this moment make Remarks very requisite.(1) I have been ill 4 days tho' I have had a pen in my hand all the Time in my Chamber. Genl. Ward is quite unwell, he has attended Congress e the Bd. of War while he ought to have been in his Bed Room. Mr. Adams is not out, I fear he is also unwell. It was to make up a Delegation that I have risqued myself this very vile day. Questions on European important Concerns are agitating; and single Voices serve several States, as always heretofore. I do not mention this because I am averse to the Rule of our State that 2 should be the least to give her Vote here especially when she directed 5 or 4 to attend \""upon the Duties of the Delegation. \"" Nay if she does not enjoin that upon more than 3. But when she makes 3 necessary \""to give the Voice of the State\"" she puts a great hardship upon 3 when only 3 are attending the Duties of their Delegation and runs a treble Risque beyond several States of losing her Vote here daily. Mass. has been at extraordinary Expense beyond many states in furnishing heads and hands to perform Congress Drudgery, and her members have more of the Work of standing Boards & Committees than most others, because their Residence has been more usually permanent; This has exposed her to lose a Vote when she has made numbers necessary to give it. One of her Delegates may often render tenfold Service on the Board or Comtee. of which he is a member by serving an entire day on it than by being in Congress merely as a rnake-vote. You well know these things by your past Sufferings, and Mr. Gerry has felt them at the Peril of his Life. Whatever may have been the Intention of a remarkable Variety in the Course of 4 years respecting the Voice of Mass. here, I do believe that in the present Case the Words do not speak the Intentions of the Movers of the Resolve. I am so persuaded of that, as to determine not to present the latter Vote to Congress with the proceedings of Oct. 4, more especially if one of us here shall be unwell;-till I hear more from you. I am almost determined not to write any more to you for either my Letters must be quite insignificant or I must tell Tales to the Enemy. 10 or 11 of those I wrote Novr. 20 & 21 are gone into N. Yk. Among them those to Mr. Gerry (inclosing one I think from Mr. J. Adams), Doctr. Holten, Docter Whitwell, Mrs. Adams (inclosing one certainly from her Husband), Govr. Hancock, Mr. S. Gridley with my Rhode Island & Family Letters.(2) I am told two mails from hence are laying at Fishkill.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia, December 19th, 1780  Yours of the eighth instant (1) came to hand yesterday. I was sorry to find the Assembly had not then taken up the recommendation of Congress on the subject of the western lands. Its being postponed so late will, I fear, prevent the result of their deliberations from being communicated to Maryland before the rising of their Legislature; in which case much time must be lost, unless their Delegates be authorized to accede to the Confederation, on a cession satisfactory to themselves,-a liberality of proceeding hardly to be expected from that State, after the jealousy and reserve it has shown. I am no less sorry to find so little progress made in the plan for levying soldiers. it seems, contributed by Virginia, the North Carolina Assembly having broken up without making any effectual provision of that sort. One would have supposed that the fatiguing service exacted of the militia in that State, would have greatly facilitated such a measure, and yet that is assigned as the obstacle to its practicability.  I wish anxiously to hear from you on the subject stated in my letter by Grayson, and in my subsequent one by the post.(2) Circumstances which I do not choose unnecessarily to hazard by the post, have made it expedient to lay the matter before the Assembly, that their former instructions may not be invalidated by a supposed effect of a change of situation, or may be rescinded if real. This went by W. Jones, Esquire, on his return to North Carolina, who, I suppose, will not be at Richmond till nearly Christmas. I wish it could have reached the Assembly before your leaving it.  MS not found; reprinted from Madison, Papers (Hutchinson), 2:249.  (1) Ibid., pp. 232-33.  (2) The \""subject stated\"" in Madison's November 25 letter \""by Grayson\"" and his December 5 letter \""by the post\"" concerned new instructions from the Virginia legislature on the free navigation of the Mississippi River, for which see the Georgia Delegates' Proposed Resolutions, November 18, note; and Virginia Delegates to Thomas Jefferson, December 13, 1780.

  Dear Sir Philada. Decr. 19th. 1780  You preserve your character for punctuality so well that I always have the pleasure to begin with acknowledging the receipt of a favor from you. That of the 11 instant (1) came to hand yesterday. As the sufferings of your Militia are ascribed to the conduct of their Commanding Officer, I hope the digust will be only local. A general disgust would be a very serious misfortune.  We are informed from good Authority that an embarkation is taking place at N. York.(2) From the number of Regiments & Corps mentioned, it probably consists of about 4000 troops. Knyphausen & Philips it is said are to have the command of them. Their course will without doubt be directed to the Southern States.  We have a probable story from the Southward, corroborated by a paper from N. York, that Tarlton has had an encounter with Sumpter, in which he lost upwards to 100 men including the wounded, & received a mortal wound himself. Sumpter is said to have been wounded but slightly and to have lost one man only. The personal wound of Tarlton is omitted in the N. Y. Paper, but his loss otherwise is represented as greater than our own account makes it.  I am Dr Sr. Yrs. sincerely, J. Madison Junr.  ""

  My dear Sir. Philadelphia Decr. 20 1780 Mr. Palfrey is just embarking, so I have only a few Moments to inform you, that I have this Morning been conversing with an old Man and an old Whig, who has all his Days been an Inhabitant of South Carolina & Georgia. (1) He was taken Prisoner last Summer & carried to New York, from whence he lately came to this Place. And though his Fortune would enable him to live here at Ease, he thinks he can be useful to America by returning to that Part of it, and at the Age of 73 [has] undertaken the long Journey. He has always mixed with the People of those States, & is well acquainted with their Temper & Sentiments. He also has been much among the Indians & is greatly beloved by them. This Account I have had of him often from the Delegates of Georgia & others whom I can confide in. The  DECEMBER 20, 1780  old Gentleman tells me that the People of those States are in general firmly attachd to the American Cause, & most fervently deprecate their being finally seperated from the United States. His Soul was refreshd to hear me say that I did not apprehend any Danger of it- that the Idea would, in my Opinion, be abominated by the Eastern States, and, as far as I could judge, by all the rest. He says, that the Creeks & the Chictaws, which are the most numerous tribes of Indians, consisting of at least 8 perhaps 10 thousand gunmen, are our staunch Friends. The Heads of them have lately spoken to him in this Language, \""We stand [on] the same Ground with you, we drink the same Water & breathe the same Air, we are the Trees, you are the Buds, & can there be Fruit if the Buds are nipped off. \"" These are forceable Words, which express their own Sense of the Necessity of their Union with us for their very Existence. They are a sagacious as well as a powerfull People, & an Alliance & Friendship with them is of Importance to all the United States. The People, of whatever Nation, who shall possess Georgia & South Carolina, will be the Leaves of their Trees. It is my Opinion, that even a Thought of leaving the Inhabitants of those States to be subject to any foreign Power, who so gallantly defended themselves in the Begining of this Contest, & have lately sufferd so much for the Sake of American Liberty, would not only be unjust to them, but in a high Degree impolitick.  In every View we see the Necessity of a sufficient Naval Force. A few Ships of War at the Bar of Charles town, & a Frigate or two in Stono River, might at this time effect the Recovery of that City. I need not inform you, what an Effect the Sight of a Sixty Gun Ship would probably have at Penobscott. Do not our Enemies conceive the Idea of Uti possidetis? And Can there be Peace in America while Britain holds a Foot of Ground in any Part of it?  Adieu, S A  ""

  Dr. Sir Philadelphia Decr. 20th 1780 Presuming on our former acquaintance, while we served together in Congress, I take the liberty of introducing to you Mr. John Benezette, (1) of this City, who proposes to visit you at Amsterdam. I hope you will find him, what he is esteemed here, and I believe him to be, an honest, Sensible, inteligent gentleman, and most unequivocally attached to his Country. I shall not sollicit for him DECEMBER 20, 1780  your attention and regard. I know he will deserve them; and I know you too well to doubt, in that case, his obtaining them.  Having lately left the Scene where our affairs labor under the greatest difficulties, I mean the southern department, it will probably not be disagreeable to you to know my Sentiments relative to them. Some Events, it is true, were unfortunate, but to me, they Seemed rather the result of Misconduct, and a precipitation that condemned all precaution, than of weakness. Nothing can be a stronger proof of that determined, unconquerable Spirit, which Animates all America, than what appeared in the State of North Carolina immediately on the defeat of General Gates near Campbden. The rout of his army was as compleat as can be imagined. The utter loss of Tents, Wagons, and every Camp Necessary made it impossible for his Troops to keep the field. Want of magazines, which, through some defects in the Staff departments, had been neglected, rendered it almost impossible to collect the Scattered Soldiers. Appearances could not be more desperate. Even the General gave up all hopes of defending the Country, and thought of nothing but the Safety of the remains of his regular Army. But, under all those Circumstances, the People, tho laboring under all the distresses inseperable from an unprovided Soldiery, flew to Arms with the greatest alacrity; resolving that the Enemy should not find their Country an Easy prey if even they should not be able, finally, to withstand them. They had the Success that such spirit in a people will always Command. They obtained a most compleat victory over one of the principal divisions of the British Army, with Numbers much inferior to those they Conquered. They harrassed the other division with incessant skirmishes, until they obliged them to retreat a considerable distance into South Carolina. The war may impoverish and distress us: we may be many times unsuccessful. Our armies may be dispersed: our finances deranged, but a people, pervaded by such a spirit as animates all America, never can be Conquered.  I refer you to some other Correspondent for details. The spirit of the people appears to me, and, I am persuaded to you also, of far more interesting Consequence.  I am Sr with much regard and Esteem, Your obedt. Set.  Tho Burke  ""

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia, 21st Dec., 1780. You will have heard, before this reaches you, the state of my health on my arrival at this place. I now begin to hope I may recover, though I am still confined to the house, and my cough, attended with fever, very troublesome; but I sometimes go down stairs and mix with the gentlemen who lodge in the house, and those who visit them, which I find of some service to me. I had the pleasure of hearing, by the last post, that Mrs. Iredell was getting better; I hope by the next to hear every body is well. Congress seem to be very busy; but as I have not yet taken my seat in it,(1) I am acquainted with but few particulars, and if I was acquainted with any thing interesting, I should be afraid to write it by the post, as there is reason to apprehend that, before this reaches you, the enemy may be in possession of some of the towns in Virginia through which the post passes, as we have certain advices that 4,000 troops, under the command of General Kniphausen, have been some time past embarked, though we have not yet any advice of their having sailed, and their destination is kept a profound secret in New York. Congress have sent a Colonel Palfray, formerly paymaster of the army, to France, in the character of consul from the United States: Colonel Laurens, son of the late President, is appointed a minister for a particular purpose to the court of France. This last appointment is much disapproved of by some of the members, apprehensive of its disgusting Dr. Franklin, and by that means impeding rather than promoting our interest at that court. Mr. Dana, secretary to Mr. Adams, is appointed minister to the Empress of Russia: it is uncertain how he may be received, but the general opinion is, that the old lady will not be displeased with the compliment.  23d. I have just heard of a brother of Mr. Granbury's, who sets out in the morning for Carolina; I will therefore close this letter, and endeavor to send it by him; and can now venture to mention the distresses of Congress in regard to money matters. Nothing can be more alarming. The treasury quite empty, and no means of filling it, to answer the pressing demands which are daily made upon it. What adds to their distress: the supplies for the army are not yet laid in, and they have been disappointed in getting over a quantity of clothing, promised for the use of the army, in France. Expenses here exceed all conception from the great number of prizes brought in, and large importations from Europe to this place, the town is filled with all kinds of goods, and furnishes supplies to all the Southern States, and the State of New York; this draws all the circulating cash in these States to this town; this occasions such a profusion of money here, that every thing is most enormously dear. I had almost forgot DECEMBER 21, 1780  to mention, that the British ministry have carried all before them in the late general elections. Most of the eminent characters in the opposition are left out-namely, Mr. Fox, Mr. Burke, Mr. Wilkes, with a number of others, whose names I do not recollect. An unsuccessful attempt was made to oust Sir George Saville. My best respects to Mr. Barker and all my other friends. You will observe there are some circumstances in this letter which should be communicated with caution. Tell Mr. Smith I will write to him soon; and let him see this. Present my love to my sister Iredell, my sister Blair, Nelly, and the children; tell them I think of them with all imaginable tenderness. Though I am now writing at two o'clock in the afternoon, it is so dark I can scarcely read what I write.

  Sir Philadelphia 22 Decr 1780 Your Very Oblidging Letter of the 18t Instant is recd. I am but little Surprized at the Vexation Oliver Meets with in his Business. (1) I saw the Inveteracy which some felt towards him-and Very much doubted of the Expediency of his holding his Business especially after I saw that Mr. Hubbard had determined not to continue in Office. I knew that the office would be but poorly supplyd with Money- That there was no Forage provided-That some knavish Fellows were determined to Embarrass and Misrepresent every Part of his Conduct to get the business for themselves or for such as were like them-as well as to gratify their malice against me for Opposing some of their Villanys. These were sufficient Reasons with me to be extremely dubious as to the Expediency of his being in this Business. His Wish was not to be idle, and hoping that Matters might not be so uncomfortable for him as I feared, I was upon the whole willing that he should be gratified, and I believed that he would Discharge his Duty in the best Manner he was able. But I am extremely glad that he has determined to quit the Business, and more so under Circumstances so agreable as those you mention. You may be assured Sir, that this as well as other Acts of your Kindness excites my Warmest Gratitude. Might this youth be in a Situation agreable and Usefull to himself and beneficial to others it would give me that  DECEMBER 23, 1780  parental Pleasure which those who never felt the Relation can have but little conception of. What he has suffered by being in this Business will be Nothing more I hope than a disagreable Seasoning. His living in Litchfield would be very agreable to me in every other View than that I believe it will not be best for him, And shall therefore advise him to Embrace so advantagious an offer.  The publick Papers will give you a general Veiw of the Complexion of the Times. The Pride, Chagrin and Lust of Revenge of G Britain will undoubted urge Great Britain to continue the War, to obtain an end which is now I apprehend indubidably certain that every Nation in Europe is opposed to. The B. Administration consider themselves as playing a desperate Game and therefore, will probably risque every Event. I think that we have not the least Reason to apprehend that Nation will be able to contravene the Wishes of all mankind-If she will madly persist, which I believe she Will, the War will I apprehend be carryed on by her opponents, with more energy than it has hitherto been. Necessity will Oblidge to this. We gain frequent advantages at the Southward. My best compliments to Mr. Elsworth and Mrs. Elsworth. I shall Write to him by next Post.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia. December 25th. 1780 Your favor of the 14th instant did not come to hand 'till the 23d; it has been somehow strangely delayed. I was severely attacked with a rheumatism & fever a few days before you left the city, otherwise I should have waited on you in order to have conversed about the affairs of Delaware previous to your departure. As soon as I recovered so far as to be able to walk out, which was only last week, I enquired after the Bill you mention, and found it had been in the hands of a Committee from the beginning of the Sessions of Assembly, and that instead of enacting it into a law they continued the Act for the suspension of the tender &c. until their next meeting, which will be the first Tuesday in February. The original draughts I procured from the Clerk of the House, and, not being able to copy it, now transmit it to you, begging you will be pleased to return it to me by some safe conveyance after you have done with it, as I shall be greatly censured should it not be restored to the Committee at their meeting. Laws for amending the Acts, making the continental money &c. a legal tender, have passed in most of the States Eastward of this, but they have fixed a ratio or scale in certain cases at forty for one, and enabled the courts in all others to determine according to their discretion, so that no great instruction can be obtained from any of them: however I shall endeavor to get some of their laws on this subject, as well as others, which I think may be of use to you, and if possible transmit them by this opportunity.  DECEMBER 25, 1780  Let me entreat your attention to the Delaware Regimt. and put them on as respectable a footing as the troops of Pennsylvania; on our army, next under God, the success of our cause depends. I wish some measures may be adopted for procuring the exchange of Captain Silas Snow, and some others of our virtuous countrymen, who have languished as prisoners so many years with the Enemy. The militia must be also put on a regular system; they may prove a useful resource.  Taxes for the purposes of the army, for the payment of our quota of the interest on Loan Office Certificates, and for the maintaining the civil Government, must be imposed. This last, the civil government, appears to me to have been too much neglected in Delaware. Unless the principal Magistrate, and Officers concerned in the administration of Justice, are supported in an honorable manner, the country will be governed by a parcel of ignorant & extortionate men; for there are but few to be found, that are possessed of great talents, who will devote them intirely to the public-service solely for the public benefit; and rather than incur want in such a service they will be likely to employ them for their own emolument.  And now, my dear Sir, permit me to say a few words respecting myself. I find that my health and fortune are impaired by my unremitted attention to public affairs; what I undertake to perform, I do with all my might; and having very little relief in attending Congress, I find that this, and the discharging the duties of Chief Justice, a Trustee of the University &c. &c. are more than I can perform to my own satisfaction: besides, the Rank I am obliged to maintain is greater than comports with my finances. I must therefore beg of you to appoint some Gentlemen as Delegates, who will attend in Congress at all such times as I am obliged to be on the circuit or in courts, and that one of them may relieve me occasionally at other times, and permit that relaxation which is absolutely necessary as well for the mind as the body; otherwise that the General Assembly would be pleased to excuse me the honor in future, which is my ardent wish.  I have never in any year received as a Delegate, as much money as would defray my personal expences incurred in the service, and have not been offered a farthing since the first of January 1779, now two years wanting a few days. If an adequate allowance is made to your Delegates, you have Gentlemen enough qualified for the station, who I am certain will cheerfully undertake it.  You will herewith receive printed Copies of the Acts lately passed here respecting the Embargo (Bread as well as Flour ought to have been permitted to be exported), the Pennsylvania troops, Duties on imports &c. &c. most of which I should think it the interest of our State to adopt.  My intention was to have waited personally on the General  Assembly at Newcastle, but my indisposition will, I fear, prevent me. I was desirous, unasked, of throwing in my Mite for the benefit of the State in it's present difficulties; if you sit any time I may perhaps be able yet to accomplish my desires in this behalf; however I purpose to continue my service [in] Congress until I hear from you, if my health only remains as [it] is.  Please to present my best regards to Mr. Vn.Dyke, Mr Read, and the other Gentlemen, who may enquire after me, and believe that I am, Dear Sir, Your affectionate and obedient humb [servant]  Tho M:Kean P.S.

The armed Neutrality proposed by the Empress of Russia is Acceded to by Sweeden, Denmark, Holland & its Said by Portugal likewise. Count Estang on the 24th of Octr. last was at Cadiz with a fleet of 74 Ships of the line. Mesr. Guichen had arrived there with a Convoy of 140 Merchantmen from the Westindies. The Terrible Hurracane in the West Indies I presume you have heard of before Now. Several Skirmishes have happened to the Southward between Genl Sumpter, Col Clarke & the british Tarlton, Wimys &c in which the latter have been worsted, Col Tarlton its Said is mortally wounded, Major Wimys wounded & taken prisoner. Mr Dana is appointed to go to the Court of Russia. Col Jno. Laurence is appointed to go to France to obtain the aids of money and other Supplies wanted for our army. Col Palfry is gone to France in the  DECEMBER 25, 1780  Character of Consul & Commercial agent. Questions of Finance are Still on the board-it behoves the States to exert themselves mightily & I beleive they will not loose their reward. My Compliments to Mrs Ellsworth & to all friends with much Esteem & respect your Obedt humble Servant, Jesse Root  Dec. 27th. P.S. By returns Recd. from Genl Green this day Genl Sumpter on the 20th ult had a Severe action with the british Tarlton & repulsed the Enemy who left 92 dead & 100 wounded on the field. Genl Sumpter had 3 killed & 4 wounded he being among the latter.  Also that on the 1st Inst one Ruges, (2) a Col. Cook & 112 Tory officers & Soldiers immured themselves in a log barn on Ruges plantation which barn was abaticed round. Lt Col Washington of the light horse got knowledge of their Situation-with about 90 men-mounted a pine log on Carriages in form of a Cannon & marched in plain Sight of the Enemy toward the barn but before he discharged this formidable peice of artillery he thought proper to Summon the Enemy to surrender & told them what their fate must be if they refused, they immediately Surrendered without firing a gun.

  Dear Sir Philadelphia Decembr 25th 1780 I expected to have the pleasure by to Morrows Post of transmitting to You the Result of Congress respecting the dispute between the Town of Portsmouth and Mr De latour but Congress has been so immersed in the Business of Finance that I was not able to obtain a Determination but hope you will receive it by next Weeks Mail.  I shall however take the Liberty of giving You the following deffinition of the Droit dau Baine and Droit de Detraction.(2) Droit dau Baine is a Right by which Sovereign Princes claim the Estates of Foreigners dying within their Dominions to the exclusion of Heirs, Administrators &c. This is defined in Molloy De jure maritimo (3) and by most other Writers who treat of the Laws of different Nations. This Droit dau Bane is part of the common Law of France. The Droit de Detraction appertains more particularly to the German Dominions and is there exercised for preventing the emigration of the Subjects of one State to the Dominions of another or to Foreign Kingdoms and is thus defined by the German Law[y]ers.  \""Le Droit de Detraction or Jus detractus gabella Heriditatis Censur emigrationis is a certain Sum which ought to be paid to the Sovereign DECEMBER 25, 1780  upon the value of the Estate of those of his Subjects who quit His kingdom to pass into another or upon the sale of an Estate descending to a Foreigner who will not come to inhabit in the Country. This Right varies much from an Hundred to ten per Cent according to the amount of Sales of the Estate which the Heir or Lagetee would carry out. The Sovereign has a legal Hypothecation and the preference of payment in such Goods. In some Countries This Right is by common Law, in others such as France after the treaty of abolition of Droit dau Bane it is exercised only by retention.\""  This expression is become the Style in the Treaty of abolition and is found in our Treaty of Commerce by superabundance & by an Exercise of foresight in the Parties contracting.  The King of France therefore by abolishg those Rights respecting the Americans in effect permitted their Estates to descend to the Heir or to be taken by the Executor or Administrator and permits them to depart from His Kingdom with all their Effects without substraction or diminution.  What He now requests from the American States is to pass Laws granting like Privileges to His Subjects.  I have the Honor to be, with much Esteem your most obedt Servant, Jno Sullivan  ""

  Dear Sir. Philada Decr 25. 1780. Agreeably to my promise I have thrown together some thoughts on the subject of our last conversation. I am sensible they are not sufficiently matured and digested. However I shall be happy if they furnish any useful hints. The subject is important and merits the attention of those who are employed in the legislature of any of these states.  After many fruitless attempts and a war of six years our enemies must be convinced that it is not in their power to subdue us by force. During the contest, our numbers are rather encreased than diminished. We have now more arms and more ammunition than we had at the beginning and experience has instructed us in the military art and taught us to use them to better advantage. Their DECEMBER 25, 1780  prospect of success in a farther continuation of the war, and their hopes of subjugating us, if they still retain any, must rest wholly on the derangement of our finances. If these can be put upon a proper footing, we shall soon see an end of our troubles and have nothing to fear from the ambition or malice of our enemy. The arrangement and right management of our finances is therefore an object of the greatest importance. Our resources are great if we can but adopt wise plans to call them forth. For although some individuals have suffered by the war, yet the people in general are rather enriched. Our farms are cultivated as formerly, our harvests have been plentiful and our future prospects are favorable & flattering: A spirit of oeconomy and frugality prevails. Our farmers in general possess freehold estates and are thereby unencumbered with rents. We are not burthened as in other countries with the maintenance of expensive clergy. From all which causes we are in a condition to apply a greater part of our income and of the product of our labour to the public exigencies and are able to bear a greater load of taxes than most other nations in the world.  The great question is, in what manner ought these taxes to be levied? There are two methods in use; one by a direct application to the people for the sums necessary; the other by imposts and duties. The latter is a mode of drawing money from the people insensibly. For although the money is at first paid by the importer, exporter or possessor of the article, upon which the impost or duty is laid, yet as he who advances the money always takes care to indemnify himself by adding it to, or deducting it from the price, according as the impost or duty is laid on articles of home consumption or foreign exportation, the money is refunded to him by the people and generally with a considerable additional sum for having advanced it. But little attention is paid to the duty as it is blended with the price of the commodity.  This is a favorite scheme of levying taxes in monarchies and aristocracies, where large sums are expended that will not bear a public examination, But in republican governments, such as are established in America; it is dangerous and inexpedient. When people are called upon for taxes and feel the burden of them, they are more attentive to abuses and misapplication in the expenditure and will of consequence be more watchful to prevent their rulers from bribing the people, as is often the case, with their own money and subverting the public liberty by means put into their hands for securing and defending it.  The people of America are in general sensible and intelligent; Convince them that taxes are necessary and they will cheerfully pay them. It appears to me that during the present controversy, the people have been always readier to pay than the legislatures to lay or call for taxes. Before Governments were established it was no doubt   prudent in the rulers to take the tone from the people. But the present situation of affairs requires that the legislatures should take the lead. We have used expedients and temporised so long, that our cause is in the utmost danger. Distress is coming upon us like an armed man. And nothing but the most vigorous exertions can secure our independence and preserve us from the most dangerous convulsions. We have depended upon emissions of paper money without establishing funds for its redemption, until we have ruined public credit. Various schemes of finance have been tried until the people have lost all confidence. The public treasury is exhausted, the army greatly in arrears & unsupplied; And no hopes are left of replenishing the one, or of paying and supplying the other, but from our own internal resources. The contest is of such a nature that we cannot reliquish it at pleasure, Duty, interest and necessity therefore all combine to enforce the immediate and most speedy collection of taxes.  As by the means of embargoes on our exports and the consequent ballance of trade against us the country is drained of Gold and Silver we must necessarily make use of paper money of some kind for a circulating medium and to a answer our present demands. But it will be in vain to attempt this without calling in, and sinking the old continental currency. Congress was sensible of this and therefore proceeded in their resolution of 18th March last, that the new money should not be issued faster than the old was brought in and cancelled, in the proportion of one of the former for 20 of the latter. (1) For this purpose they called upon the states to pay in their quotas of fifteen million of dollars per month until the whole two hundred millions which had been emitted were brought in and cancelled. In order to prevent any undue advantage that might be taken by those, who had amassed large sums of the old currency, it was recommended that in collecting the taxes the new money, which might be issued, should be received at the rate of one of the new for forty of the old, which was at the time of passing the resolution the average rate of exchange between silver and paper money. And it was generally imagined that this would have fixed the exchange and stopped the farther depreciation. It is very probable it would have had this effect if the several legislatures had immediately complied with the resolution of Congress, passed laws conformable thereto and proceeded to taxation. But while the legislatures neglected to adopt the measure, the people who apprehended they would soon be called upon for large taxes took advantage of the public and demanded a higher and a higher price for the commodities they had to sell. The farmer and the dealer in foreign articles seemed to vie with each other in raising the price of their respective commodities. And as by reason of the embargo on produce Gold and silver was the principal article of remittance to foreign countries they also rose in price with other articles. By which means the depreciation of the paper went on until it had  advanced to upwards of an hundred for one. People at length began to see their folly and soon became convinced that by raising their prices they diminished their fortunes. They therefore stopped short and by general consent brought it back to 75 for one, at which rate it now seems fixed.  This operation has produced one good effect. It has changed the ideas of the people and brought them back to the old mode of estimating things by specie prices. There is scarce a man now to be found who rates his estate or the commodities he wants to buy or sell in continental currency. Government should therefore avail itself of this change and, in order to redeem the old currency and provide supplies adequate to the public exigencies, should call for taxes, the first to be paid in specie or continental money equivalent at the rate of 75 for one and all future taxes in specie or new money at par. By this means a state may in a month or six weeks by a vigorous exertion call in & redeem its whole quota of the old currency without overburthening its inhabitants and lodge in its treasury a large sum of the new money, which by calling for & collecting the future taxes every two or three months at farthest may be brought into credit and circulation without any compulsory laws and rendered equal in value to Gold and silver. By which means the public treasury may be supplied, debts discharged, the army recruited and paid & Congress enabled at the opening of the campaign effectually to cooperate with our ally and probably bring the war to a speedy and happy issue.  Congress having in their act of 18th March last resolved that new money should be emitted in a certain proportion as fast as the old is brought in and cancelled and having determined that the quantity of the new money should not exceed ten million dollars have directed that six tenths of the new as fast as issued be delivered to the states and the remaining four tenths reserved for the payment of the army and other public demands.  Suppose a state not to have called in and cancelled any part of the old continental currency. Let it take a fifth of its whole quota of the two hundred millions; divide that by fifty and call for a tax equal to that fiftieth part to be paid within a month or six weeks at farthest either in specie or continental currency at the rate of 75 for one. If any Gold or Silver is received let it be exchanged for continental currency at the same rate, and the whole amount of the tax in that currency being brought in and cancelled, the six tenths of the new money issued in lieu thereof which the state will receive will be sufficient within a trifle to redeem the remainder of the quota which is uncollected. Let the state then proceed to call for another tax to the same amount to be paid within a month or six weeks in specie or new money only at par and direct all those who have old continental currency to bring it in and receive new money in lieu   thereof at the rate of one of the latter for 75 of the former. By this means the new money being absolutely necessary for the payment of taxes and being received at par with Gold and Silver will immediately become an object of desire and be received with readiness. And the remainder of the states quota being brought in and cancelled, new money will be issued in lieu thereof, the six tenths of which will go into the state treasury and enable government to discharge public debts and recruit the army so that the taxes raised from thence forward may be wholly applied to the current expences of the war and government.  The following calculations will fully explain my meaning: The quota of the two hundred millions called for from the state of Delaware is 2,266,666 2/3 dollars. In order to make the calculation easier say 2,267,000  One fifth of this is 453,400  453,400 divided by 50 gives 9,068  The state of Delaware then is to call upon its inhabitants for a tax of 9068 dollars to be paid within one month either in specie or continental currency equivalent at the rate of 75 for one: consequently  the product in continental currency will be 9,068 multiplied by 75 which is equal to 680,100 This being cancelled new money will be issued in lieu thereof to the amount of 1/20 equal to 34,005 doll. The six tenths of this new money which will belong to the state is 20,403 Consequently this at 1 for 75 will redeem of the outstanding quota 1,530,225 To which add what was before paid in & cancelled viz 680,100 make 2,210,325 So that there will remain to be redeemed only 56,675 Cont.Dol. which will require only 755 2/3 dollars new money more than the 6/10 received in lieu of the first specie tax. And upon bringing in and cancelling the remr. of its quota viz 1,586,900 old The state will receive for its 6/10 of the new money 47,607 from which deducting the above mentioned 755 2/3 There will remain for discharge of debts and raising recruits &c 46,851 1/3 which by continuing to call for other taxes as above mentioned will become of equal value to so much Gold and Silver. But as all the states are jointly and severally pledged for the redemption of the two hundred million of dollars issued, and as South Carolina, whose quota is 16 millions, is at present, on account of  its being invaded, unable to redeem its quota; Suppose the quota of South Carolina divided among the other states in proportion to their respective quotas, then the quota  of Delaware will be 2,448,000 doll.  The fifth of which is 489,600  This divided by 50 gives 9,792  which will be the specie tax which the state will have to call for; But  suppose it to call for 10,000 This at 75 for one will produce of old continental currency 750,000 For this the state will receive its 6/10 of the new money issued 22,500 which at 1 for 75 will redeem of the outstanding quota 1,686,500 to which adding the sum already cancelled viz 750,000 there will only remain to be redeemed 11,500 which will require only 153 1/3 dollars of the new money more than was received for the first specie tax. And for the 1,698,000 dollars when brought in the state will receive in new money 50,940 from which deducting the above mentioned 153 1/3 dollars there will remain in the treasury for the use of the state 50,786 2/3. In order to fix the value of the new money and to give the receivers and holders of it a solid assurance of its stability and credit, funds must be established for paying the annual interest and for redeeming and sinking the capital in six years which is the time limite for its redemption. The act of Congress above mentioned recommends that every state provide funds for paying the interest and redeeming the capital of such part of the new money as is issued in lieu of its quota of the two hundred millions continental currency.  The full quota of Delaware being  as is above mentioned 2,448,000 dollars  Its proportion of the new money for which it will have to provide funds to be sunk in six years is 122,400 dollrs  Consequently reckoning the interest at 6 per cent per annum The state must provide a fund to sink the 1st year 27,744 2d year 26,520 3d year 25,208 4 year 24,072 5 year 22,848 6 & last year 21,624 Here I could demonstrate that a fund of 10,000 dollars per annum faithfully applied would in twenty three years discharge the annual interest at 6 per cent per annum and pay off or redeem the debt of 122,400 dollrs and leave a ballance in the treasury. This would unfold  the whole mystery of funding and redeeming the national debt and the whole art of financeering as practised in G. Britain. But as I hope this mystery of iniquity will never be admitted into any of these United States I shall not trouble you any further on this subject.  The Labour of the Husbandman and the industry of the people is our best national fund and taxation the best mode of drawing it forth. I have already shewn that by means of a tax to the amount of 10,000 dollars The state of Delaware will be able to redeem and call out of circulation its whole quota of the old continental currency. But to bring the new money into credit and circulation to defray the expences of government and to carry on the war the people must be called upon for farther taxes, and the vigor and industry with which they are collected will be the best means of inducing the people to bring in the old money, of establishing the credit & value of the new and of extricating the public from its present difficulties and embarrassments and to bring the war to a happy conclusion by a safe and honorable peace.  I think it is an observation of some of the writers on finance that the amount of rents paid by the people of Great Britain is more than double the current coin of the kingdom and that every Guinea and piece of money passes twice in the year from the tenant to the landlord besides answering the other purposes for which it serves in commerce, in taxes and in the ordinary dealings between one man and another. It is farther observed that the whole amount of taxes levied annually on the people of Great Britain compared with the number of inhabitants is nearly 40/ sterling per head including men, women and children. Surely then it will not be unreasonable to expect that for such a prize as we are contending, in supporting a cause on the issue of which depend not only our liberty and property but also our lives, the people of America should contribute annually a sum equal at least to the amount of the new money which is ten million of dollars. The quota of this for the state of Delaware would be but 10,200 dollars a month, which with what is necessary for paying the interest and sixth part of the principal abovementioned would make in the whole 12,512 dollars per month or if paid in quarterly payments 37536 dollars a quarter. This at first view may appear a large sum to be raised in so short a time; but when compared with the number of inhabitants in the state, or with the value of their property real and personal, or with the value of the annual produce, it will be found not to be greater than what they can easily bear. I presume the number of inhabitants in the state is not less than 40,000, if so the tax will not amount to a dollar per head in three months. Compare it with the property real and personal and it will scarcely be a half penny in the pound; or compare it with the annual produce and it will scarcely amount to 1 per cent. I am firmly persuaded that the county of Newcastle could easily alone pay this tax. That County  is well inhabited. The land is generally fertile and in a good state of cultivation and improvement. The county is I suppose near 40 miles in length and upon an average eight miles in breadth and must consequently contain more than 200,000 Acres of Land. It has several towns some of them well built, rich and flourishing. Will any man persuade me that such a county as this could not in a contest such as the present once a quarter pay a tax which does not exceed 1/ 3 an Acre. Surely then, it cannot be deemed burthensome, to the whole state. But suppose it should be somewhat burthensome, it will serve as a stimulus to excite in the people a desire of procuring the new money and consequently induce them freely to part with their produce and the fruits of their labour to obtain it, and will operate in giving it a credit and circulation better than ten thousand compulsory acts or tender laws.  To enable the people to support the burden of taxes and to give a spring to industry it will be necessary to facilitate the sale of such articles as the inhabitants have to spare and of consequence the ports should be opened and embargoes avoided except in cases of absolute necessity. It will also be proper to cultivate by all possible means a spirit of frugality and to discourage and if necessary restrain by suitable regulations the extravagant use of foreign articles. This will prevent the farther exportation of gold and silver & by turning the ballance of trade in favor of the state will necessarily draw into it, fresh supplies of those precious metals. Though I totally disapprove of imposts and duties when laid for the sole purpose of levying taxes, yet I have no objection to the laying a tax on foreign articles of luxury which we can well do without and obliging the importer to pay that tax in Gold and Silver only. This would be a regulation of trade wise and proper under our present circumstances: nor would it be amiss if it were carried a step farther and the vender or consumer taxed for dealing in or using such articles. Frugality is itself a great revenue and joined with industry is the surest means of making states and individuals rich and flourishing. But exclusive of this consideration the present distresses of our country and the dangers to which we are exposed from a cruel merciless and invading enemy ought to impress every thoughtful mind with an abhorrence of every kind of extravagance. Besides what an absurdity is it, and how ridiculous & contemptible must it make us appear in the eyes of our allies and of all Europe to be applying to foreign nations for loans and aids of money, while we are lavishing away in luxuries, gewgaws and trifles, sums sufficient to carry on the war and to extricate us from difficulties and embarrassments.  The United States are just entering upon the stage of political existence. The novelty of their appearance will naturally attract the attention of other nations and from our conduct at our first outset they will form their opinions with regard to our character and the   rank we are to sustain among them. It is easy to see what an influence the favorable or unfavorable opinion of foreign nations will have not only in the present controversy but likewise in our future intercourse with them. If we exert ourselves with zeal and vigor in defending our rights and maintaining our freedom, we shall be honored and respected and will meet with countenance and support. The most powerful arguments to induce other sovereign powers to interest themselves on our behalf is to convince them that we are in condition to make ourselves respected and have firmness and resolution to maintain our cause. But if we discover an inability or unwillingness to do this we shall find ourselves neglected and contemned. It is said that when the King of Prussia was solicited to acknowledge our independence, he replied that we must throw sixes (alluding to a fortunate cast of the dice) before he could take such a step. Our chief reliance therefore under God ought, in our present arduous enterprize, to be on our own exertions. To implore the assistance of Heaven, without using the means in our power, is rather mockery than religion, and to rest upon foreign nations for aid without exerting our own strength and applying our own resources is folly in the extreme. When we first engaged in this contest we declared that rather than submit to the domination of Britain we would sacrifice not only our fortunes but our lives. This is now the time to demonstrate the sincerity of those declarations. I hope the people of America will evince that they deserve that freedom and independence for which they are contending by a cheerful sacrafice of a portion of their wealth and by a ready acquiescence in paying such taxes as are necessary for defraying the expences of the war and supporting government. But in levying those taxes the legislatures should endeavour by all possible means to render the collection of them cheap, easy, expeditious and certain, to adapt them to the real wants of the public and the abilities of the people and to apportion them in such manner that all may bear the burthen alike.  The mode of laying and levying taxes in this and the neighbouring states is in my opinion too dilatory to answer our present exigencies and is at the same time too expensive and unsatisfactory. The hosts of Constables employed in making out lists of property, the numerous trains of assessors for rating the property and laying the tax, and the courts of commissioners to hear appeals with their tribes of clerks and attendants besides the collectors all on wages consume a great part of the taxes levied: while at the same time, there being no certain rule given to guide the judgment of the assessors, jealousies prevail not only among individuals but between county and county and complaints are made of partiality and an unequal distribution of the burden. Taxes are always disagreeable when a considerable part of the sums raised sink in the pockets of those employed in laying and levying them. But a sensible people will bear heavy burdens when  they see them faithfully applied to the necessities of the public and when they are convinced that all share the burdens of the public alike. It is not enough that equality is preserved between the individuals composing a township or county. To preserve the peace and tranquillity of the state it must pervade the whole and it should be apparent by a comparison of one county with another or by the mode of laying the tax, that every part bears its due proportion.  To enable the legislature to call forth the resources of the state or to raise taxes adequate to the public wants and the abilities of the state, they ought to be possessed of a competent knowledge first of the real wants or exigencies of government and secondly of the ability of the inhabitants. The first branch of knowledge comprehends  1st A list of the civil officers of government, their salaries and emoluments.  2d An estimate as accurate as possible of the sums necessary for public buildings, highways, causeways, bridges &c as well as for seminaries of learning promoting useful arts and for maintenance of the poor.  3d A like estimate of what may be necessary for internal defence namely Arms, ammunition, fortifications &c.  4th The quota of the state as agreed upon in Congress for the general defence and for carrying on the war.  As these things come under the immediate notice of the executive it should be made a part of their duty to obtain the necessary information and to have the proper estimates made out and laid before the legislature at the end of every year or at their first meeting after the annual election together with an account of the expenditures of the preceding year.  The second branch of knowledge comprehends  1st The number of inhabitants in the state, their ages, occupations and employments, whether single or married and if married the number of their children and servants. It would be satisfactory and might answer valuable purposes in government to know the number of both males and females reduced to classes of a certain age, for instance under ten, from ten to eighteen, from eighteen to twenty six, from twenty six to forty five and from forty five upwards in one or more classes as may be thought proper.  2d The stock of wealth possessed by individuals, including their estates, real and personal so far as the latter may be judged subject to taxation.  The second branch of knowledge should be obtained from proper returns made to the legislatures. The making such returns may at first view appear too arduous and difficult and not worth the trouble, but I am persuaded that by proper regulations it will be found to be practicable and easy and may be the means of removing all complaints upon account of the inequality of burdens borne by   individuals or by communities within the state and may serve as the best foundation for establishing a proper militia law and creating sundry regulations and institutions for perfecting the government and internal police of the state.  In Connecticut which is one of the best regulated and most vigorous states in the union, I am informed this is done annually with great facility and to great satisfaction. I have not been able to obtain a sight of the law directing the mode but understand that it is to the following effect.  The counties in that state are subdivided into towns answering your hundreds. Each of those towns is a corporation for certain purposes. They have a power of making bye laws not inconsistent with nor contrary to the laws of the state, for their internal government. They have stated meetings for the purpose of appointing certain officers to manage the affairs of the town. Some of these officers are called select men, who superintend the morals and manners of the people and see that a due obedience is paid to the laws of the state, as well as to the regulations of the town. The select men have the power of calling occasional meetings of the towns, giving public notice of the time and place of meeting and the purpose for which it is called. When the people are assembled they chuse a moderator who presides and regulates the debates and preserves order.  The law, above alluded to, provides that at the annual meeting each town shall chuse certain officers who are called Listers and that on a certain day in every year, every householder within the town shall deliver or send to the Listers who meet at a certain place for the purpose a written account of his family, occupation & property, particularising the quantity and quality of his land under the titles arable rneadow or pasture and woodland with a description of the buildings and improvements, also his neat cattle, horses, hogs, sheep &c his carriages whether for pleasure or farming; and if required the names, occupations and ages of every individual composing his family. If any neglects to make a return, he is rated in his property by the listers at fourfold of what he possesses, or if in his return he omits any article, which ought to be included therein they rate him fourfold of the article omitted. One half of the tax raised for such delinquencies goes to the listers. From these several returns the town clerk who is another officer chosen by the town make a return to the state treasurer by a certain day; keeping a copy among the records of the town. If any town neglects to make such return it is rated fourfold. These returns are digested by the treasurer, cast up and laid before the legislature. In order to avoid disputes, to prevent complaints on account of partiality and to make the burden of taxes as equal as possible, the law fixes a price upon every article. For instance every male from 18 to 60 years of age is rated at 18 or 20 pounds, dwelling houses of one story according to their hearths or fire places at certain prices,  those of two stories and upwards according to their hearths at certain higher prices. Lands at prices according to their quality; arable at one price, meadow at another and woodland at another and lots within a certain distance of large trading or capital towns at a higher price proportioned to their relative value, compared with the lands in general throughout the country. As persons of larger estates can bear a greater proportional tax than those who have only a bare competency; the select men and listers have a power to rate at a higher value than the law has fixed not exceeding a certain sum lands possessed by one man to the amount of two, three or four hundred acres and upwards and make a proportional abatement on the small plantations of one hundred acres and under, so as not to lessen the value of the town collectively according to the rate fixed by law. The law also fixes the price at which mills, forges, furnaces, ferries and inns are to be rated; also, the price of horses, neat cattle, sheep, hogs &c, but it leaves to the select men and listers to rate the occupation or trade of the individuals; as this is too indeterminate to be ascertained by law. To the returns made from every town by the town clerk is added the valuation as fixed by law or rated by the select men and listers. And the sum totals of those several returns shews the legislature the wealth of the state so that knowing the sums necessary for the purposes of government & comparing them with the amount of the wealth returned the legislature has only to pass a simple resolve \""That a tax of sixpence or of one shilling in the pound (more or less as the case may require) be levied on all rateables and taxable property agreeable to the lists delivered in on such a day and that the same be paid in by such a day and that the treasurer issue his warrants accordingly. \"" Upon this the treasurer immediately issues his warrants to the several towns and the collectors who are appointed at the annual elections by their respective towns immediately proceed to the collecting. As the town has the choice of the collectors, the law make the whole corporation or town responsible for him so that if he neglects to bring in the quota of the towns by the day appointed the treasure may issue his warrants to the sheriff of the county commanding him to go into the town and seize any property he may meet with and make sale thereof to the amount of the quota or deficiency. It is however expected he will first fall uppon the collector. And the instances are exceeding rare where it is necessary to proceed to such extremity. When the taxes are large and likely to be burthensome to the midling and lower classes of the people it is usual for the legislature to call for a sum one ninth part larger than what is necessary or expected to be raised and to give a power to the select men and listers to make abatements in whole or in part to individuals who are in indigent circumstances to the amount of the tenth part of the quota of the whole town. This with the power before mentioned of rating the lands of proprietors   of large estates somewhat higher than the small freeholds gives releif to the poor, throws a greater share of the burden upon the rich and consequently makes the people easy and contented. It is farther to be observed that there is very little deducted from the tax on account of the laying or levying it. The Listers are not allowed any thing for their trouble save what may arise from the extraordinary taxes laid upon delinquents and the collectors are allowed for their trouble only one penny in the pound. The select men have nothing but the honor of serving their country and the satisfaction of distributing equal justice and relieving the indigent which in all free governments ought to be the principal reward of public officers.  How far the above plan may be improved or amended I cannot pretend to say. But as the exigencies of government, during the war must require large taxes, I would propose that the whole amount of what may be necessary within the year be divided into four quarterly payments-That the state treasurer should lodge with the sheriff of the county and with the clerk of the quarter sessions or county courts duplicates of the debits against each particular town or hundred within each respective county, that the several townships or hundreds should be obliged to appear by their collectors at the said courts and make payments to the state treasurer who should attend in person or by his deputy and in presence of the sheriff and clerk of the county receive the money in open court and that credit being given on the duplicates of the sheriff and clerk should discharge the town and be a quietus to the collectors-that if any towns are delinquent the sheriff should compel payment before the next term at which credit should be entered as above and if the money was paid to the treasurer in the intermediate time his receipt should be taken and delivered to the sheriff to be lodged with the clerk of the county. That the clerk of each county should make quarterly returns to the legislature countersigned by the sheriff of the sums so paid and received which returns should be sufficient to debit the treasurer, and the warrants or orders drawn upon him by the proper authority should be his discharge.  As all the money levied from the people should come into one treasury and be accounted for, I would further propose that all fines and forfeitures should be added to the duplicates of the debits abovementioned delivered by the treasurer to the sheriffs and clerks of their several counties and returns thereof made by the clerks to the legislature. And here I would submit it to consideration whether it would not be adviseable instead of allowing certain officers (especially such as act in a judicial capacity and high ministerial officers such as sheriffs and marshals of the court admiralty &c) to pay themselves by fees, to order the fees to be collected by proper officers added to the duplicates aforesaid and paid into the public treasury, And to pay the officers stated salaries.  By some such mode as is here pointed out the resources of the states may be called forth with ease to the inhabitants and with the least possible expence; the public credit may thereby be restored, the exigencies of government provided for, contracts made and the articles wanted procured on the most advantageous terms; and by thus arranging our finances and convincing our enemies that we are in a condition to carry on the war we shall I am persuaded soon bring them to acknowledge our independence and to grant us peace on honorable terms.  But as our present demands are urgent and immediately wanted no time should be lost in calling upon the people to pay in two or three monthly taxes agreeable to the last assessments in the mode heretofore accustomed until such time as a law can be made to the effect and for the purposes abovementioned.  As for the mode of raising recruits for the continental army and regulating the militia of the state I must reserve my thoughts for some future occasion, and will only add here that I am much mistaken if the state find any great difficulty in furnishing its quota of men provided it adopts the foregoing plan or some one similar and proceeds with vigor and resolution in carrying it into effect.  I am, Dear Sir, Your affectionate, Cha Thomson  P.S. As the whole success of the foregoing plan depends upon the punctual collection of the taxes, I find upon farther inquiry, that the Connecticut law pays a particular attention to that matter and provides that the sheriff upon receiving the warrant from the Treasurer shall first call upon the collectors & seize their effects. But if they cannot be found or if their effects are not sufficient he shall then proceed and levy upon the effects of the select men & listers, who in that case are empowered by the law to indemnify themselves by rating & collecting from the inhabitants of the town a sum sufficient to reimburse themselves for all losses & damages. The town, also has power to call the collectors to account as often as they think proper, to take security for the faithful discharge of their duty, to remove them at pleasure & appoint others. In short they have a sovereign controul over them & are at liberty to guard against their laches (2) or unfaithfulness in such way as they may judge best.  ""

  Phila. 26th De'r 1780. 1 Qu. What Methods have been taken for raising men & what prospect of Success? (1)  Ansr. A Law is in force for raising men on a bounty of One prime Slave and a Tract of (I believe) 200 acres of Land to every Soldier for the War who shall compleat the term of Service, and to the family or representative of Such as may die in Service. Besides this a bounty of money was appointed, but the depreciation has made it Inconsiderable .  This act has had little or no Success, nor do I expect any from that or any other Expedient for raising regular Troops so long as the Circumstances of the war require so many of our Militia in the field. Very few can at any time be found to inlist voluntarily, because landed property is very easily acquired, the Climate is mild, and the Soil either fruitful for agriculture, fit for raising Stock, or for  DECEMBER 26, 1780  producing Naval Stores. The War has exhausted all or most of the men who might be calculated upon for voluntary inlistments.  2 Qu. What methods for procuring Supplies?  Ansr. A specific Tax is laid, which, on the lowest computation, will yield 500,000 bushels of Indian Corn, or other provisions Equivalent. Besides this the Commissioners are authorised and required, if necessary, to take, for public use, one half of all the provisions which can be found in the State above what may be necessary for the Support of the Inhabitants. Powers are given for calling forth Teams &c for transportation but this is a very difficult business, and destructive to the agriculture of the State. So many of our Wagons and Horses have been destroyed, disabled, or lost in the late affair near Cambden, and, before that, in the distant Service to which the Militia were called, that the Country retains but a very scanty Supply for its agriculture for which they are Essentially requisite. Teams, however, and carriages have been supplied for the movements both of Militia and regulars, but in Consequence thereof the agriculture has been very much Neglected.  Commissioners are appointed with ample powers for employing the resources of the State in the purchase of Arms, Amunition, cloathing and other foreign Supplies. I cannot Say I expect much from their Efforts, but rather wish these Supplies might be sent from abroad. A money Tax of 7 I/2 per cent on the gross value of property valued at 7 for 1 on the specie price.  3d Qu. What towards relinquishing Vacant Lands for the use of the United States?  Ansr. This has never yet been submitted to the Legisla[ture] nor indeed do I know upon what principle it is requ[ested]. I believe it will be difficult to Convince the State that a [large] part of her property should be made Common Stock w[hile] others retain all their more Valuable property entire and unaffected by such a Contribution. This is Conjecture. The Question cannot be pointedly answered.  Sir, In the foregoing you will find all that at present Occurs to me on the Questions propounded to me by Mr. Mathews on your behalf.(2) I wish my answers could be more agreeable, but the truth must be told to you, and your prudence will best point out the use you may be able to make of it.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia, December 26th 1780.  Since my arrival here Congress have been mostly Employed about the foreign affairs and nothing Material has happened that Relates to our State.(1) DECEMBER 26, 1780  The Letters from Europe which we have Lately Rec'd give us little hope of peace, altho' all the powers of that Country are taking measures which are Evidently against the Interest of Great Britain.  The Armed Neutrality which has been so much talked of, is come into by all the neutral powers, and which will undoubtedly make very much in our favour.  By our last accounts from the Southward are that, Colo. Tarlton of the British Legion made a very vigorous attack on Colo.

  Please your Excellency Philadelphia Decembr. 27th 1780 The want of a Safe Conveyance, and my Sons having the Small pox in the family, of which he is got well, prevented my writing to you Sooner. Inclosed are Extracts of letters which passed between the Count Vergennes Minister of France & Mr John Adams-which need no Comment.(1) Also a Copy of a letter wrote to the board of war from the President & Council of Pensylvania,(2) avowing & Justifying their orders to Lt. Hunter to Stop Supplies Carrying on to wyoming by order of the Commissary Genl; and the Subsequent resolution of Congress respecting that Post;(3) the whole being of Such a nature & Complexion I thought it my duty to Communicate the Whole to your Excellency that you may write to Genl Washington on the Subject in Case you Shall think it proper & necessary.  The tenour of the armed Neutrality among the northern powers, the States which have acceeded to it & their naval force; with the manner in which it is received in Britain, the inclosed papers will Explain nothing is Clearer than that this Confederacy does most pointedly Counteract the Veiws of Britain with respect to America, for it legitimates a free trade with us without Exception-which has been interdicted by great Britain. Messr. Guichen arrived at Cadiz on the 24th of Octr. with a Convoy of 140 Sail of Merchantmen,  DECEMBER 27, 1780  where was also Count de Estang with 74 Ships of the line. Mr. H Laurance is Committed to the Tower on a Charge of high Treason. Mr Adams is impowered to negociate the business in Holland which Mr Laurence was to have done. Mr Frances Dana is appointed our Minister at the Court of Petersburgh to acceede to the neutrality & to negociate other business which may be beneficial to these States.  Col John Laurence is appointed to go to France to enforce the reasons for granting us the aid Solicited from thence & to Send over the Supplies So much wanted for our Army.  The british Ministry hold up to their people an Idea of paccification; to keep up the Credit of their funds & quiet their minds of the people under the heavy losses they have Sustained in the Summer past-and to amuse their Enemies while they are Secretly Meditating war & reveange. The Kings Speech at the opening of the new parliament, it is Said, Contains nothing very Important only with respect to America he is please to observe, that those rebellious Subjects who rise against Government must be reduced to distruction or the Constitution must fail. Overtures have been made by the british ministry to the Court of Madrid, for an accommodation which that Court rejected unless France Should be included-to which the british Minister replied-that France was So Connected with America that they Could not treat without America, to this the Spanish Minister answered, that his Court was no less bound to France than France to America.  The System of Government over these States as at present exercised is extremely defective. The Sovereign power of war & peace, having no permanent funds in its possession, nor the means of establishing any Must feel itself weak & prevent or defeat almost every measure however necessary & render the Execution languid tardy & oft times wholly abortive-The wealth of the States Constitutes the great fund on which we must depend for Credit abroad & for resources at home-and while these are drawn forth at the volition of each State, by recommendatory requisitions only it is in the power of any State to defeat the most important measure.  The union of these thirteen States, for their mutual interest & Safety, Constitutes a republic of States or political persons-of which great republic, each State Constitutes one Member or Subject- over which Congress is appointed to preside and it is as necessary that Congress Should exercise the powers of Coercion over the particular States for the general purposes of the Confederacy as it is that the Confederacy Should Continue in its present form-or that each State Should exercise Such power over its particular Citizens for the weal of the State-and this power is so far from infringing upon the right or Sovereignty of the particular States-that it is as necessary for the preservation of them as the union itself.  The result of the Convention at Hartford has been laid before  Congress and is Committed-I flatter myself it will Serve to facilitate Some usefull & necessary regulations. The business of Finance in the present Situation is destressing & extremely embarassed-had all the States punctually Complied with the resolution of the 18th of March with respect to sinking the old bills & Issuing the new-& had the new Issued in the time, quantity & Credit proposed, four tenths only is to go into the Continental Chest-which would be a very inadequate Supply-but few of the States have Issued any of the money, Some have not taken resolution even to Comply-& the new bills Issue with an evident depreciation, besides I dont See how it will be practicable to Sink the old bills by Taxes on account of the unequal manner in which they are distributed in the States- Some have a great Surplus while others lack of their quotas-to Stop the Circulation by a resolve of Congress is a Stroke of power which has been already but too often repeated for the Credit of public bodies-it is easey to See how Such an exertion of power must disagreably effect the Credit of the New money-for individuals will distrust the faith of that body which in any Instance makes use of its power to alter or rescind As engagements to the Prejudice of Individuals. By the System ten million of dollars only was to be put into Circulation, one sixth to be sunk annually; besides this the States must be taxed annually to raise the Current Supplies-the year is very far elapsed-the measure but partially Executed in any & not even attempted in Some. Query will it be posible for the States now to Carry this System into Execution-& at the Same time raise the necessary Supplies for the next year. The pay of the army which is in arear Eight months will Swallow up the 4/10.  The resources of a Country are to be estimated by the wealth of its Citizens and the means established for drawing that wealth into public use. The ordinary method of doing this is by taxation; and as this must be laid on by general rules in equal proportion, Scarce any State is able by this means to raise more than one half of what its inhabitants are able to pay because while one part is Oppressed the other Scarcely feels the burden, recourse ought therefore to be had to other means to releave the necessities of the public by more equal exactions-& this I think may be done by duties & Imposts in the Continental way if Judiciously laid & Carefully Collected (4)-for if they are laid by the particular States for their particular benefit-it is easy to See that the Collection will be vastly unequal-for one State may Import for many others who Consume the articles & of Consequence pay the duties which the State that Imports takes the benefit of-whereas if laid in a Continental way & for Continental use no State will pay for more than it Consumes & none Share in the profit beyond its Just quota. Again if these duties are laid indiscriminately on all the necessaries of life it must distress the poorer Sort which ought to be releived-but if they are laid upon luxuries   & Superfluities which are Consumed only by the rich & Opulent an amazing Sum might be raised without distressing any body-but why do I trouble your Excellency with reasoning upon a Measure which is evidently out our power to put into practice.  A letter is Just received from Genl Green (5) Informing Congress that it is Impracticable at this Juncture to institute a Court of inquiry on the Conduct of Genl Gates-and that his transactions at that time was more owing to Misfortune than misconduct in the Opinion of the Officers that were present.

  Sir, Philadelphia 27 Decr. 1780 According to the present Veiws, G Britain smarting with her Losses and incouraged by her Success to the Southward, is Violently Actuated by those different Passions, and will at all Hazard, continue a War in which it certain She is opposed either openly or Secretly by every Nation in Europe. But the Dishonour which the British Administration think they must suffer by their Loss of America, their disappointed Pride, Ambition and Lust of Revenge will excite them to keep up the War as long as possible. It becomes Us to prepare accordingly And have our Army established, and provided for and paid. And this America must do exceapt to Cloath the Army. And why exceapt on Acct. of the disordered Condition of our Finances are We not Very Able to do it. Money is not the Wealth of a Country if it was so We should be poor indeed. For the Old Bills which give us So much Trouble do not exceed in Value half a Million Sterling. Shall We have all our affairs imbarrassed by the Existence of this Stuff. We certainly in my Opinion can do infinitely better without any publick Bills than with these. Indeed I do not See but what We might do pritty Well if there were no publick Bills in the Country. But at any Rate I think that those old Bills ought to be cancelled within a limited Time, not in Declaration only but in Fact-perhaps individual States may adopt Measures which will be equitable to provide for an Exeemption from the Embarrassment of the old Bills by the first of May-The Time when Congress proposed to have the Bills Sunk.  Congress have many Things to do, but Want Materials to Effect any Thing Very Material. They must be supplied with money from the States and until that is done, the States must in their individual Condition Support the War. This is conducting it under great Disadvantages .  Our Affairs to the Southward are quite as well as We could exceapt them to be. In all the small Actions which happen our People have the Advantage.  DECEMBER 27, 1780  Here is Health and Plenty So that a Man if he had a Cart load of Money might probably live well a month. Were the Provisions carryed to Genl. Washingtons Army in Case they were fully established which are Weekly brought to this Market, they would be fully and regularly supplied. Shall not the United States be able to do what is effected by a smal Part of one of them. The Provisions brought to this Market are paid for. We pay for Nothing. Shall everybody be rich but the Publick. Sir Part of the Surplus Wealth of Individuals must be collected to carry on this War, upon the Event of which every Thing interesting depends-and but a part of the unncessarys of Life or at least such as are not Wanted will be sufficient. Those must be proud and in that Case We Shall do well. I believe it may be a real Question wheather the Country taken Collectively have been made poorer by the War. Attend as well as you can either to what you Shall perceive to be either the Real or Apparent Wants of the People and then judge. Are another People as Well fed and as Well Cloathed as they were before the War. Is there Not a great Plenty of forraign Manufactures and even Luxurys amongst us. Look into the Stores in Philadelphia and Boston and this will be found to be the Case. This City is I believe as full of goods of all Kinds as it was before the War. I beleive that Boston is probably much fuller. What then is the Dificulty-cannot those Amazing Resources be drawn out by paying for them. To an infinite Amount they are continually selling here to Individuals and Yet the Publick cannot Buy any Thing because they can pay for Nothing. But why cannot they Pay? What Fascination prevents the publick, being Rich when it's constituent Parts are Rich? It would be a Most Scandalous Story to tell, that a Country was undone, because it did not know how to make Use of it's Wealth for it's Necessary Defences.

  Philadelph 27 Decr. 1780. The Hon Mr. Mathews has desired me to inform Col Laurens (1)-Whiether Connecticut will have for the next Campaign, their Line in the Army compleat, according to the Requisition of Congress?  Whiether that State will furnish the Provisions for the Army, required? DECEMBER 27, 1780  Whiether that State has or will Cede the Unlocated Territory which they Claim, to the United States?  My Answer to the first Question is-That the State has offered a large Bounty to every Recruit who Shall inlist in the State Line for three Years or during the War. Besides this, by an Act of Government, each Town in the State is divided according to it's Taxables into as many Classes as they are deficient in their Quotas- which Towns and Classes are Oblidged under a Severe Penalty to furnish their respective Recruits by the first of February. I am of Opinion that Connecticut will have their Line in the Army the Next Campaign, as full as it has usually been.  My Answer respecting Provisions is That the State has by Law Oblidged their Towns to furnish for the Army for the Next Campaign, Salted Beeff, Salted Pork and Flour to the amount of about Six Thousand Barrells. These Provisions will be cheifly collected in Flesh. The Law ordaining this Supply passed but a little Time before I left the State. I am credibly informed that this Measure is carrying into the most cheerful and Vigorous Execution.  The large Demands for Provisions for the French Fleet and Army at Newport, and the alluring Pay which they make induces great Quantitys of live Beeff, to be Sent there. This Circumstance I apprehend will render it More Dificult for the State to furnish this Article to the Amount required than it would otherwise be, But Notwithstanding I am of Opinion the Zeal and Vigor of the State will Surmount this Dificulty-And I am perswaded that Shall the Other States exert the same Vigor to furnish Men and Provisions for the next Campaign that Connecticut will. That even if no Successfull Efforts Shall be made the next Campaign by our Ally; either by Cooperating with us to Suppress the Foe in America, or by diverting more effectually the War from this Country, But that the Main Weight of it must Still be Sustained by Us. That even in this Case upon similar Exertions it will not be in the Power of the Enemy to gain any Material Advantages over the Northern and Middle States more than they usually did before the Alliance.  As to the third Question-Connecticut has Ceded to the United States all their unlocated Territory West of what they call their Susquehannah Purchase, which if I rightly remember extends Two Leauges (2) West of the Delaware. This Cession is made upon Condition that the other States claiming unlocated Territory Shall Cede proportionably according to their Claims. Connecticut are Very sincere in Wishing that the Unlocated Territory (except such Lands as are yet within their Susquehannah Purchase unlocated which they think it reasonable for them [to] retain) might become a common Interest. The State are disposed to have these Cessions made not from any Apprehension that they cannot as well and even better Support their Claims than any other States, when they consider that  DECEMBER 28, 1780  their Purchase can be well ascertained-And that the same Act of the Crown which constitute the once Colony of Connecticut with the Powers of Government Vested the Colony with the Fee of the Land which the State now Claims. But what influences the Conduct of the State in this particular is a Desire to adopt a Measure which might Cement our union, and Constitute an Estate for the Publick Seperior to what any other Nation possesses-and which if rightly Managed, might be used for the Introduction of Millions of industrious Forreigners to become Purchasers and Settlers. The Avails of which Purchases made by Forraign Property would within a few years be more than sufficient to pay the whole Debt incurred by the War.  As Col Laurens will go to Boston or Newport in either Case it will be Very convenient for him to See Govr. Trumbull, from whom he can Obtain more particular and perfect Information than it is possible for me to give him. Oliver Wolcott  ""

  Dr. Sr. Philadelphia Decr. 28th [1780] My time is so much engaged at present that it is with much difficulty I have found a leisure hour to comply with your two Commissions. You will therefore not be surprized at my fire being somewhat weaker than it formerly was, especially when you consider that my way of fighting is now with an air gun. We have been lately sweetend with two or three strokes of good news from your Part of the world-Sumpters, Washingtons and Malians affairs-and have no doubt when the Big knife (1) becomes sufficiently sharpened of hearing that you have given them a Coup de Grace. All the northern news stirring at present is that Admiral de Ternay is Dead-that the Infamous Arnold has gone on an Expedition to New London with the Command of about 2500 Ragamuffins as may be supposed; for who else can be supposed will be commanded by him. Enclosed you will receive by Mr. Peter Thornton (2) son of Col.

From the Situation & Disposition of the Powers in Europe, Russia in particular, by the latest Intelligence, Congress have thought it expedient immediately to send a Minister to the Court of Petersburgh, and for the Sake of Despatch, among other Considerations, have appointed the Honble Francis Dana Esquire (now in Europe & Secretary to Mr J.

  My dear Sir Philade Decr 30 1780 I receivd your favor of the 6th Instant, but not till the 25th. The Post has been very irregular of late, & our Letters grow old before we receive them. It is a Shame that the Mail has been catched a second time in the same trap. I inclosd to you a Warrant on Mr Appleton for the Amount of your Demand for boarding the orphans of our late Friend Genl Warren. I think I did not send the Letter by that Post. But being uncertain I informd you in a subsequent Letter of my having sent the Warrant, and desired you to inform me whether it had come safely to hand. I expect to hear from you in Answer DECEMBER 30, 1780  to my last at least, & shall then conduct the Matter if necessary, as you have proposd.(1) Our Government, I perceive, is organizd on the Basis of the new Constitution. I am affraid there is more Pomp & Parade than is consistent with those sober Republican Principles, upon which the Framers of it thought they had founded it. Why should this new OEra be introducd with Entertainments expensive & tending to dissipate the Minds of the People? Does it become us to lead the People to such publick diversions as promote Superfluity of Dress & ornament, when it is as much as they can bear to support the Expense of cloathing a naked Army? Will Vanity & Levity ever be the Stability of government, either in States, in Cities, or what, let me hint to you is of the last Importance, in Families? Of what Kind are those Manners, by which, as we are truly informd in a late Speech, \""not only the freedom but the very Existence of Republicks is greatly affected?\"" How fruitless is it, to recommend \""the adapting the Laws in the most perfect Manner possible, to the Suppression of Idleness, Dissipation & Extravagancy, \"" if such Recommendations are counteracted by the Example of Men of Religion, Influence & publick Station? I meant to consider this Subject in the View of the mere Citizen. But I have mentiond the sacred Word Religion. I confess, I am surprizd to hear, that some particular Persons have been so unguarded as to give their Countenance to such kind of Amusements. I Wish Mr______ (2) would recollect his former Ideas when his Friend Whitfield thunderd in the Pulpit against Assemblies & Balls. I think he has disclaimd Diversions, in some Instances, which to me have always appeard innocent. Has he changd his opinions, or has the Tendency of things alterd? Do certain Manners tend to quench the Spirit of Religion at one [ti]me & are they harmless at another? Are Morals so vague as to be sanctified or dispens'd with by the Authority of different Men? He does not beleive this-but I will not be severe, for I love my Friend. Religion out of the Question for the present. It was asked in the Reign of Charles the 2d of England, How shall we turn the Minds of the People from an Attention to their Liberties? The Answer was, by making them extravagant, luxurious, effeminate. Hutchinson advisd the Abridgment of what our People called English Liberties, by the same Means. We shall never subdue them, said Bernard, but by eradicating their Manners & the Principles of their Education. Will the judicious Citizens of Boston be now caught in the Snare, which their artful insidious Enemies, a few years ago laid for them in vain? Shall we ruin ourselves by the very means, which they pointed out in their Confidential Letters, tho even they did not dare openly to avow them? Pownal, who was indeed a mere Fribble, venturd to have his Riots & Routs at his own house, to please a few Boys & Girls. Sober People were disgusted at it, & his privy Councellors never thought it prudent to venture so far as expensive   Balls. Our Bradfords, Winslows & Winthrops would have revolted at the Idea of opening Scenes of Dissipation & Folly; knowing them to be inconsistent with their great Design, in transplanting themselves into what they called this \""Outside of the World. \"" But I fear I shall say too much. I love the People of Boston. I once thought, that City would be the Christian Sparta. But Alass! Will men never be free! They will be free no longer than while they remain virtuous. Sidney tells us, there are times when People are not worth saving. Meaning, when they have lost their Virtue. I pray God, this may never be truly said of my beloved Town.

  Dear sir Philadelphia Decemr. 30th. 1780 I had the Honour to receive your Excellencys favours of the 22d Ult. and 7th Instant by the last post. The President is informed that you had not received the Resolution recommending the Six Million Tax (1)-But he says it went by the way of Boston, and thinks you have received it before this.  In my last I informed you, of my Intention to return home,(2) immediately upon being relieved, But you will see by the inclosed Resolution of Congress, that I am elected a Commissioner of the Board of War.(3) I confess I do not think myself fully justifiable in accepting the Appointment without the Approbation of the State, whose directions I conceive myself bound to observe. As I did not solicit the Appointment, I flatter myself I shall be pardoned by my Constituents-And have undertaken the task upon no other principle than that of serving my Country with honesty and faithfulness to the extent of my small Abilities.  As no more expence will accrue to the State on Account of my delegation I have inclosed an Account of my Expences, and of the Monies I have received and will send the Vouchers by the first safe Conveyance. DECEMBER 30, 1780  I have sent to your Excellency by Colo. Peck a Collection of Accounts, Expenditures and Estimates which have been taken from the best Authorities and you may rest assured are as compleat as our Situation at present, will admit. I at first collected the Materials for my own Information, and afterwards thought it might give you such information as would be agreeable and to the Honble the General Assembly such as might be necessary. And for that purpose I wish through you to communicate the Contents to that Honourable Body, with that degree of Secrecy, that you may think necessary. And if the Information is received with one half the satisfaction it is given, I am fully paid for all the pains and Trouble I have been at in making the Collection and the highth of my Ambition gratified.  The President of Congress received yesterday dispatches from General Greene dated at Charlotte the 7 Instant by them it appears he had relieved General Gates and taken the Command of the Southern Army, these dispatches contain but little News, only that Col. Washington of the Dragoons had taken by Stratagem a Tory Garrison consisting of a Colonel Rugesly and one hundred and eleven of his Associates without firing a Gun.  As I am now out of Congress, it is not in my power to give you a particular detail of the transactions of that honourable Body. But I make no doubt you will receive the fullest information from Genl. Varnum whose pen is more able than mine. At the same time I shall continue to embrace every Opportunity in giving you every information that shall be for the Interest of the State so far as shall come to my knowledge.  As it is the heighth of my Ambition to deserve well of my Country and after the many Honours conferred and Trusts committed to my Charge by the State to which I belong, to be unmindful of her welfare would be the heighth of Ingratitude, at the same time to lye under any Censure by my Constituents for any misconduct would be one of the most mortifying Circumstances that could befall me, I must therefore beg you will be so kind as to inform me even if it is only supposed I have been guilty of an Omission in the duty I owe the State since my residence in this City that I may endeavour to give satisfaction either by information or retraction.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia Decemr. 30. 1780 I have the honor to enclose you a copy of a letter of the 14th November (1) intended for you but fell into the hands of the enemy by the Mail being taken at Stratford in Connecticut and was published in Rivington's Gazette. I also enclosed you by the same post in another letter of the 18th copy of an address to the New Hampshire Officers with my letter to Colonel Scammell.(2) These also shared the same fate, copies of which I also enclose you once more, and hope they will meet the approbation of the Assembly.  What view the Enemy had in publishing those letters cannot be conceived. The French Ambassador has translated my letter into French, (3) and enclosed it to the prime minister of France by Colonel Laurens, who is appointed our special minister to the Court of Versailles, he has been polite enough to communicate the contents of his letter which is to show from the State of Our political Affairs the necessity of supplying the money, and other articles requested and urged, that as this letter was writen confidentially to the President of a State by one who has had at least an opportunity of acquiring a Knowledge of our political affairs, was not intended to answer any purpose at the French Court, but was exposed to public view by the common enemy, it must be a true picture of our situation and says that this will have more weight there than any thing that he or Congress can write as it was evidently not intended as a stimulous to that Court.  If it should answer that essential purpose I shall not regret its being taken, though I confess I am not fond of being one of Mr Rivington's correspondents .  I only have in this letter to repeat my request for money, as Congress have resolved that members shall not draw from the Public Treasury. The hint in my last letter, and a moment's calculation will show the situation I must be in for money. I wish for hard money not because it passes more currently, but because it makes a less sound and may be more readily forwarded, and I wish no time to be lost in letting me have money of some kind, and of either sort the nominal sum must not be small. I shall easily be able to convince the Assembly, that I have used every economy but the price of articles must be paid which are even in hard money most enormous.  Our Southern army have in the partizan way gained some considerable advantages over the enemy, and to continue to give them severe checks.

  Sir [December 1780] (1) Your Letter of the twenty fourth of Novr. last is at last come to hand; for which I return you my warmest thanks. With astonishment I read the several pieces of Intelligence. In the year 1760 Octor. 25. DECEMBER 1780  Portrait of Artemas Ward  G_____ the third came to the Throne. What declerations & Promises did he make? What fulsome addresses were presented to him? On the 25 of Octor. 80._____ (2) came to the throne [. . .] has he promised & recommended in words, and what fulsome nonsense has been presented to him, by way [of] addresses? Has the conduct of the two gr[eat men] anyways comported with their former declarations & engagements? I [ think ] not at all. The conduct of the last has been such if I am rightly informed, that the Jealousy of all ought to be awakened, Lest the morals of the people are debauched by his evil examples & [. . .] State we become a profligate Commonwealth. However I am always for making the best of every thing-I think it is a smile in Providence that he has discovered himself so dearly to the people and so early after his acession (as it is called in one of the acts). Unless the people are Stupedly blind (which I don't think they are) they will see their error, and if proper measures are taken previous to the next-to rouse the Genious of old Cato to address them in the mouth of & in the manner mentioned by my friend, great good will arise to the Community. People many times run into excesses for want of consideration & when this is the case there is no more effectual way to bring them to a sense of their duty than, to address them in a serious, and Solemn manner. It is of importance that it should be done in due season; should it be delayed untill the people are habituated to these Views it will be more difficult to bring them off & there will be danger of a general corruption of morals. Should this corruption spread we shall have reason to fear that destruction will follow. I am sometimes ready to fear that, this Generation must be moved of[f] the Stage [before?] Peace, Liberty & Righteousness will flourish on this Continent in a manner wished for. The Stiff necked Israelites of old, were made to wander in the wilderness untill the rebellious generation were dead before the tribes of Israel were permitted to enjoy the Promissed land. Innumerable have been the remarkable appearances of Divine Providence in favour of this people but alass how unmindful have they been of the Hand that supported and the Ar[m] that saved them. If there was that attention paid to Virtue and Religion which ought to be, and a sincere desire to acknowledge God in all our ways we might then have grounds to hope in the Divine favour for deliverance from a[ll] the Calamities we now feel. But so long as the people with their rulers at their head are in pursute of folly & vanity, we have no reason to expect anything [but] that the hand of the Lord will be stretched out against us & we be made to feel [the] terribleness of His wrath. It is the duty of every one to exert himself to info[rm] the ignorant and to reclaim the vicious, to stir up the minds of all to a sense [of] their duty, that the great exertions of our Pious ancestors to establish a re[fuge] for Liberty & Righteousness on this continent may not  JANUARY 1, 1781  at this period be lo[st] through the abounding folly & wickedness of us their degenerate offspring.

  Dear Sir Jany 1 -81 The Letter with the Strictures upon it, I propose to be publishd in Boston if you approve of it.(1) I hope the Press there is free, as the Constitution dictates. If it is not, the Liberties of the People which we have been struggling for, will, in my Opinion be soon lost. I see nothing in the Strictures disrespectful to the Governor or the Government. Indeed they were hastily drawn, & I am not unmindful of the Fable of the Ape & her young one. My Design is to discountenance the Lovers of Flattery, and to vindicate a respectable Character which has been wantonly attackd. We must support such Characters. You will easily see that for one reason & one only, it would be imprudent for me to be known. I am willing however that you should consult confidential judicious Friends. Yours-Adieu.  ENCLOSURE The foregoing is copied from a Letter signd JOHN SULLIVAN, (2) publishd at New York in the Royal Gazzette extraordinary, printed by James Rivington Monday Decr. 18, 1780, & said to be a Copy from the original. The Design of the Writer Seems to be merely to please a Great Man: That of the Publisher, partly to expose the Writer, but Principally to sow the Seeds of Disgust in the Minds of some very respectable Citizens in this Common Wealth. I think Mr. Rivington could not have wishd for a fairer Opportunity, but I am satisfied, they have more Wisdom than to be caught in the Snare.  The Letter is written in the true Stile of modern Address; and it is a Pity it did not make its Appearance in publick before; because as it is a perfect Model, it might have been of Use to others, from whom some Inaccuracies have escaped, by Means of their not having been Adepts in that Kind of writing. I have been told that he has frequently been addressed himself, and I am inclind to believe it. The Effects are such as one might expect from a Man of his Cast. He who is easily susceptible of Flattery, will soon perswade himself that he is in Reality that Great Man which his Flatterers only meant to perswade him to think they believe him to be. He will be apt to JANUARY 1, 1781  suppose, that others will have the same exquisite Feelings by being flatterd, as he has had, & that they will conceive themselves as highly honord by it, as he conceives himself to be when others flatter him. Persons who relish Flattery, will for ever be deceivd by those who design to deceive them. He will therefore employ himself in the daubing Business as often as he can find suitable Subjects, and will colour in so fantastick a Manner, as to excite a Blush on the Cheek of any Man who has a Spark of Modesty. He will go on suffering himself to be deceivd, and deceiving others like himself, till he meets with him who only can be called the truly great Man, I mean the Man of stern Virtue. Such a Man will never fail to frown when he is flatterd, & his Frowns are Death to the Sychophant.  This Writer pays no great Compliment to the People (indeed I imagine he did not intend it) in supposing that among them all, there could be but one esteemd qualified \""to regulate the political Wheels of Government,\"" as he expresses it, [...] however that he was mistaken. Two were actually in Nomination, & more were thought of by Men of great Judgment, Authority & Experience in publick Affairs. He is totally unacquainted with the Character of the People, as they are with his; nor does he know any thing of the Honourable Gentleman, whom he calls his Excellencys \""Competitor,\"" who, he says, \""in time of publick Danger feard to venture upon the Stage, and whose after Conduct seems rather to have proceeded from fortunate Successes on our side, than from the Result of Choice & deliberation.\"" I am also ready to presume, that he is not fully acquainted with the Person whom he takes upon himself so freely to address. He ought to have supposd that his Excellency would not have been well pleasd with a fulsome Compliment paid to himself, at the Expence of one of the best Characters in the State. But when men will flatter, they run a tilt with Honor, Justice & Truth, & if their Flattery takes, they feel no Remorse. The Gentleman whom he has attackd, was long before he paddled out of obscurity, one of the Helmsmen of the Ship of the State; was markd by Bernard & Hutchinson as a Champion for American Liberty; was negatived by them repeatedly, by express Order of the British Ministry, when he had the full Voice of his Country for a Councillor; continued in the high Esteem of his fellow Citizens, till the Royal Government was dissolvd by Common Consent, when the opportunity offerd, for him to take a Seat which had so long been prevented by the Governor. This he did, at Watertown, while the Enemy were in Boston. A Time, which Men, perhaps less brave, but perhaps however, of more solid Judgrnent than the Letter writer, thought to be a \""Time of publick Danger. \"" He remaind a Member of that Board, till every Body saw his Health was in so bad a State as no longer to allow of it. He therefore resignd his Seat, a Circumstance, which, though all judgd necessary, was regretted by all. He has since however, sustaind the   honorable Places of President of that much revered Body who formd the Constitution, & President of the Council of the State and he is at this time President of the American Society of Arts & Sciences in Massachusetts. How little are the Great Characters in this Revolution known, to those who were not the earliest in the virtuous Conflict! ARISTIDES  RC and enclosure (MHi: Warren-Adams Letters). In the hand of Adams, though not signed.  (1) Adams' enclosures, which he sent to warren for publication in a Boston newspaper, actually consisted of two documents (1) an intercepted \""Letter' s from John Sullivan to John Hancock that had recently been published in James Rivington's Royal Gazette, and (2) Adams' \""Strictures upon it,\"" which he signed \""Aristides. They apparently met Warren's approval, for they were subsequently printed in John Gill ' s Continental Journal, and Weekly Advertiser (though not until April 19, 1781), touching off a vigorous exchange of letters between the supporters of Sullivan and \""Aristides.\""  2 For \""The foregoing . . . Letter signd John Sullivan,\"" a fawning letter congratulating John Hancock for his recent election as governor of Massachusetts over James Bowdoin, which Adams obviously thought deserved the contempt of all true republicans, see Sullivan to Hancock, November 18, 1780, above.

I could not avail myself of your Exceys Sentiments upon the matter as I had no right to Communicate any part of a Confidential Letter which your Excey had honored me with. I had much Difficulty to Save Colo Smith who I know your Exy would reluctantly part with.(3) Mr Duane was Indisposed & did not tend Congress yesterday but a resolution for his being Continued was obtained by a very great Majority. A Motion was made this Day and Warmly urged for reconsideration but did not prevail So a valuable officer is Saved to the Army.  I am not Certain but Dayton may yet be Saved by our Report on your Excys Letter of the 27th.(4)  I have no news Except that the Enemy have Landed under Lesley at Bald Head in North Carolina. I really fear much for the Southern States. I beg yr. Excy will be so oblidging as to present my most respectful Compliments to Mrs Washington & that you will believe me to be most Sincerely Dr General your Excellys most obedt Servt, Jno Sullivan  ""

  Dear Sir Jan 6th. 1780 [1781] I hope the Papers which you will receive by this opportunity will give you personal Satisfaction as well as facilitate the Purposes of yr. Commissions. I have already sent several Copies of the Doings of Congress of Decr. 12th. 1780 as follows.(1)  \""Congress took into Consideration the Report of the Comtee. to whom was referred the Letter of June 26 from the honble. John Adams, whereupon, Ordered That the sd. Letter be referred to the  JANUARY 6, 1781  Committee of forgn. affrs., and that they be instructed to inform Mr. Adams of the Satisfaction which Congress receives from his industrious Attention to the Interest and Honor of these United States abroad especially in the Transactions communicated to them by that Letter. \""  I have no Copy of what I wrote in the Name of the Comtee. which I am sorry for as I hope soon to have an opportunity to discharge myself of all the Books and Papers, upon the Establishment of a proper Office.  I really am in a Disposition to wish that your Letter of July 27 had {no being}.(2) I am so much pleased with the motive of it apparent in the 5th Paragraph that I doubly {am grieved at the event}. Infinite Pains are taken in France and here to prove that the unspeakable Disadvantages of the Delay in sending the Cloathing to America has been wholly owing to the Manner of the Departure of the Alliance. Mr. Lee advised Landais to take the Command of her as of a Ship given to him by Congress. Mr. Lee's bitter Enemies are compleatly satisfied with this Solution of our immense Injuries; but his Friends and all candid Examiners say what could the Alliance bring in Addition to the military Stores actually on board. Powder above water? What Cloathing was the Ariel about to bring when she was dismasted? I will add no more except that there are ten thousand warm Execrations issuing dayly forth from the mouths of the injured intended for the real Cause of their Sufferings.  Janry 7th. This very noon two small Vessels arrive and bring us all the Comfort of Mr. Williams's Copies of Letters from March 3d quite up to July 25. J P Jones writes to Mr. R. Morris in Novr. 17 that the lower masts of the Ariel were then getting in and as Capt Barry has the Alliance it is judged Congress mean to give him the Seventy four but not a Lisp about the Cloathing.  Good God!  Oh my dear Sir, develop Hearts, Principles, Connections. Ship Masters have declared that they were willing to take Part of the public Stores; others have declared that Vessels were offered on Charter. Who are the owners of the Vessels on which the Goods have at times been put or are finally to be put? Affectionately, JL  ""

  Sir Trenton Jany 8th 1780 [ 1781 ]  The Committee of Congress have recd yr Excellencys favor of this Date (1) with its Inclosures (2) & Send You herewith the Result of their Deliberations upon the Terms which they are of opinion ought to be held out to the Soldiers of the Pensylvania Line.  I have the Honor to be most respectfully your Excellencys most obedient Servant, Jno Sullivan by order of the Committee P.S. It is the Desire of the Committee that you make use of the foregoing Resolutions only as you Shall find them necessary to answer the purpose in view.(3) by order of the Committee,  Jno Sullivan ENCLOSURE In Committee of Congress, Trenton Jany 8. 1781 Resolved, That all Soldiers who have voluntarily enlisted for the War or have received the hundred Dollars Bounty ordered by Congress shall be held during the War and entitled to receive the same Bounty as the new Recruits from the respective States only deducting these from the hundred Dollars at the real Value when received; But as it may so happen that Some Soldiers may be detained in the Service who have received the hundred Dollars contrary to their Inclinations all such who can make it clearly appear to Persons appointed for that Purpose as herein after mentioned that they have been so detained shall be immediately discharged.  Resolved, That all Soldiers who are now held by Inlistments expressing the Term of Service to be for three Years or during the War and have not voluntarily reinlisted and received the hundred Dollars bounty shall be immediately discharged.  The Committee trusting in the Sincerity and Attachment of the Pennsylvania Line to the American Cause and (notwithstanding the unwarrantable Steps they have taken) from the Moderation and Conduct in the Discipline and good order they have observed and being convinced that their Assembly was for the Redress of Greivances have further resolved that on producing Lists regimentally of those non commissioned Officers and Soldiers who fall within the different Classes of Grievances complained of with Regard to the Terms of Enlistment, Pay, Bounty & Clothing, that they will immediately appoint Commissioners to examine and report thereon that full and ample Justice shall be done to the Claimants by discharging such as are entitled to their Discharge giving them Certificates of Pay & Clothing due to such as have Claims. JANUARY 8, 1781  The foregoing Terms being accepted the Committee resolved that upon the Soldiers of the Pennsylvania Line delivering up the british Emissaries sent to corrupt them and submitting to their proper Officers they will publish a free and general Pardon for all Offences committed by the non commissioned Officers & Soldiers of the said Line from the 31st of Decr. last to this Time.

(1) Nothing new has transpired since we last wrote, (2) informing you of the departure of the British fleet from New York, except that in less than forty eight hours after their sailing, there was a most violent JANUARY 9, 1781  storm, which we have the best reason to imagine they had to encounter. This circumstance we flatter ourselves, will be attended with many advantages, as it will necessarily cause delay on their part, & give the longer time for your reinforcements coming in. And further, that our Express, will reach you before they can, & although the notice of their approach may be short, yet it will be of consequence.

  Sir, Circular, Philada January 9. 1780 [i.e., 1781]  You will receive herewith enclosed, Copies of two Acts of Congress of the 5th & 8th Instant.  By the former you will be informed that from the unwarrantable & cruel Treatment which our People who are Prisoners with the Enemy have of late received from them, in the Opinion of Congress an Exercise of the Law of Retaliation has become necessary, and it is specially recommended to the Executive of the States respectively to take effectual Measures for carrying into Execution the Acts of Congress of the 13th of January 1780 respecting Prisoners taken by the Citizens, Troops or Ships of particular States.(1)  By the other Act (of the 8th Instant) it is earnestly recommended to the several States from New Hampshire to North Carolina inclusive to procure for the Use of the Officers in Captivity at New York & on Long Island their respective Quotas therein mentioned in Specie or Bills of Exchange on New York.(2)  It is presumed the Necessities of those Officers, the Distresses they have already suffered, and the more disagreable Situation they must yet be reduced to for Want of the Means of Subsistence, unless those Supplies are obtained will be sufficient to induce a Compliance with this Resolution as speedy as possible.

  Dear General, Philadelphia Jany. 30th. 1780. In one of the papers inclosed you have an account of the defection of the Pennsylvania line, about one third I am told are discharged from service. About a week ago part of the Jersey line followed their example, but was soon suppressed without any bloodshed. The Commander in chief has determined to bring all mutineers in future, if any should happen, to unconditional obedience. This is a very serious event and strikes a deep blow against the subordination of the Army. If it stops here it may have salutary effects on the councils and efforts of America.  All is quiet at New York. Genl. Clinton was much elated on hearing of the revolt in the Pennsylvania line; but on hearing of the execution of his emissary and guide he droped into sadness. Not a word from Capt. Paul Jones-nor a word from Gibera[l]ter. The news from the paracide Arnold you will be fully accquainted with from Virginia.  With the highest esteem and regard, I have the honor to be, Sir, Your Most Obt. Humble Servt. Wm. Sharpe  P.S. The legislature of Maryland has instructed their Delegates to Sign the confederation, and Virginia has ceded to the united States her claims of Lands west of the Ohio river on some small conditions. This opens a flattering prospect.  ""

  My dear Sr. Philadelphia Feby. 6th 1780 [1781] Yours of the 26th I received last night with a Postscript informing me of Arnolds having bent his force towards your River. (1) If his intentions are really what he has declared them, and he executes them it will heighten the Black of his Character and make it approach to Miltons discription of that of Hell a Darkness Visible. But, my dr Sr., are we to be surprized at these things? have we not been told by the British Commrs. as early as ____'78, that they wd. ravage and lay waste our Towns and Coasts, and have we made any one preparation for defending ourselves? have we good, strong and well Constructed forts at the entrance of all our Rivers, or at least in the most commanding and narrow passes of them, with a good Galley or two mounting 36 pounders to flank them? have we proper boats arranged in case of necessity for throwing men rapidly from one Side of the River to the other? have we waggons, Carts, & draught Cattle enrolld to be calld out in Classes as the militia are, in case of alarm to enable an army to take the field and move with speed and conveniency? have we a regularly organized militia of Infantry, Cavalry & artillery, arranged under experienced Genl. officers with the Superintendance of Arsenals and Magazines erected in convenient Places, sufficient to arm and equip one tenth part of the Militia at a moments warning and march them to a given Point? These preparations I had the honor to propose to the Assembly in May last, through Col. Innis then a Member, they were then thought unnecessary; I have now repeated them to you with the most ardent wish that you wd use your Influence with the next assembly to have them or something effectual adopted. No stone has been left unturnd to procure the aid you speak of; and I have some (tho faint) hopes that it is now executing-but I much fear that we must be much more weakened before we have effectual aid from that Quarter.  FEBRUARY 6, 1781  The Revolt of the Pennsylvania line is at length finally terminated, about 1,200 remain in service but the whole are either discharged or furloughed for a short time, that their tumultuary disposition may subside, and some preventatives be applied to a future measure of that sort.  The Jersey line followed their Example, but were nippd in the Bud of Revolt, a large detachment march against them, and they were instantly brought to unconditional Submission, their leaders hangd on the Spot, by their followers and a thorough contrition and return to duty was the immediate consequence. I hope mutiny has had its course and will now subside-but does not these events strongly impress on the minds of every well wisher to his Country that it is necessary the Citizens of America shd. turn their thoughts from Party animosity and Private gain to replenishing the Public Coffers with the Sinews of War and opposition. I can hardly here help repeating two lines of a severe Satire that has lately appeard agt. our Publick measures.  \""An army naked, and unpaid, The Public lean on foreign Aid.\"" No news Authentic from Europe, but that Portugal has acceeded to the armd Confederacy; England determined to push the War in America, spight of every other Consideration-its Minister has a Garbled House of Commons completely to his mind. Count Vergennes has had some communications with Mr. A. to whom he made advances, passing over Dr. F for an explanation of our Act of 40 for one (18 March last) in behalf as he said of the Subjects of his master trading to America. Mr. A. fully answered (but did not Satisfy) him in a Manly, firm and rational manner-the Arguments of the latter were so close and conclusive in vindication of the Justice and Judicious proceedings of the Councils of America that the former beat the Charrades, and returnd again to the Usual Channel of his Communication, not without some marks of displeasure at being so unexpectedly foild. This is all the European news; Congress have come to a resolution to demand of the States, power to lay Duties not exceeding 5 per Ct. on all foreign Imports, to raise a fund for a loan for carrying on the war, the necessity of which is apparent, and that it be general is not less so. Tis for this reason Congress desire to have the power vested in them, to avoid procrastination & partial impositions. Genl. Parsons has lately (25th ult) attacked the Enemies lines at N.Y., Burnt the Huts of Delancys Corps, killd about 100, taken between fifty & Sixty Prisoners, destroyd their Bridges of Communication over Harlaem River, burnt their Magazines of forage, and taken two or three Hundred Cattle and Horses with the loss of about 13 killd and as many Wounded. I have the Honr. to be with my best respects to my Friend Yr Brother FEBRUARY 6,1781  Arthur who with yr Son is I expect by this time with you Yr. most obedt Sert, Theok. Bland  [P.S.]The above is a fact and may be relied on, as the report has been made to Congress by the Genl.(2)  P.S. I have sent a full detail of a Plan of defense on the Principles mentiond within in a letter to Genl. Nelson (3) with a request that you wd Join yr forces for having it carried into Execution if it meets your approbation.  ""
