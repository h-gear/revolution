  Sir. Extract. Philadelphia 19th August 1783 [i.e. 1782]  It is our duty to inform your Excellency that the sending out [prisoners] to America at this Juncture is not by any means a clear proof of benevolence, it may with equal probability be passed to the acct of cunning: for the enemy wish & expect to get regular Soldiers in exchange for those people, many of whom are neither Soldiers nor Sailors.(1) There is certainly a disposition in the present English Ministry to excite among the people of America some desire of a seperate  AUGUST 20, 1782  Peace. And we apprehend that nothing but vigorous & persevering exertions on our part to convince the enemy of our abilities to continue the leaden argument, will compel them to make those offers of peace seriously, which tis probable they are now making insidiously.  We have the honor &ca, Hu Williamson Wm Blount  ""

  Sir. Philadelphia 21st Novm 1783 [1782] I lately informed you that Mr. Hanson had spoke to Mr. Way for a Coach; on Conversing with him on the subject he informed me that if he made it with a Crane Neck and finished it properly he must have 500£ for it, he would do it without delay--a few days afterwards, Information was brought me, that the most elegant Coach in the Town was to be sold much Cheaper than a new one could be now had for; I sent for Mr. Way & prevailed on him to go & Examine it for me; on his return Acknowledged that it was one of his own make, had been used but a few times and exceeded anything he could now make for want of such materials & it had actually cost him 500£. he consenting Mr. Hanson when I made Application as a purchaser agreed for it at 300£. including a new sett of Harness & putting on the Publick Arms--I have also agreed for a pair of Horses & wine for the Family both Maderia and Claret--The Payments are to be made in 20 days; I thought it best to give you this early notice of it that you may not be called on unexpectedly for the Money; The whole will be about 600£. If the old Coach was advertised for sale perhaps it would bring 150£. as it has a Crane Neck. I have got the silver from the Treasurer Con- NOVEMBER 21, 1782  sisting of knives forks & spoons to the amount near 100 oz but they by no means suit my purpose except the desert spoons (which are only large teaspoons) & three (?) doz large spoons But as there is neither Tea Pott or Coffee Pott in the House I think they had best be exchanged or sold for those necessary pieces of Plate.(1) I am yours &c.

  Sir, Philadelphia Jany 1t. 1783. As the Legislature will shortly meet I take the liberty to mention to Your Excellency, that it appears to me of Great Importance, they should take up the affair of Vermont on the idea of a compromise with Massachusetts and New Hampshire and propose to those States a meeting of Commissioners for that purpose. I have little hope that we shall ever be able to engage Congress to act with decision upon the matter or that our State will ever recover any part of the revolted territory but upon a plan that will interest the two States I have mentioned, or at least one of them. If you agree with Massachusetts and New Hampshire, or with one of them, the agreement will I think meet with support here.(1) A peace may shortly take place; this makes it of great importance to our pretensions that the affair should be speedily determined.

  Dear General. Philadelphia Jany. 1st. 1783. I can only inform you that after much Labor, trouble & fatigue the Deputation set of for Rhode Island the Saturday after you left us; that they returned and will not probably go forward very soon;(1) the Reason is, Virginia has repealed her Act for an Impost. However I do not absolutely deny myself of the pleasing Hope of seeing you in Boston this Winter. I am entirely prepared for a Journey; that Preparation has cost me about two hundred Dollrs. The Purchase of a Horse, saddle & Briddle & some few Articles of Cloathing without which I could not do, you will readily conceive amounted to that Sum. It is a very unfortunate Affair to me & will either oblige me to dispose of my Share in the Bank, or to leave this Place soon. However I wish this not to be  JANUARY 1, 1782  mentioned. I recd. by this Weeks Post from the Secretary (2) an Account of the Amount of my Drafts & a Caution not to make them too frequent by Direction of the Council. I must confess it appears not a little extraordinary to me. It gives me Pain least you should meet with Difficulty, on Account of the Order I gave you. If this should be the Case, I wish you not to press the Board very hard if you can negociate it in Boston for a short Time, & write to my Brother Isaac Osgood at Salem, I doubt not but he will be able pretty punctually to discharge it, I have by this Post requested him to do it;(3) in Case you request it, & inform him when & where. I have inclosed you a Copy of the Secretary's Letter to me & my Answer thereto.(4) I dont recollect that we have any foreign News of Importance since you left us which can be communicated, Tho I am at a Loss to know whereabouts we were in that Respect, at that Time. The Prospect of Peace is not less flattering--perhaps more--yet I should feel much happier to see the Treaties Signed--for I think there are many Considerations, if not on our Side, elsewhere, that may prevent a speedy Peace. The Arrangement of Newhampshire, Rode Island and New Jersey Lines are postponed to the first of March next; & also three Regiments of Pennsylvania. But I think it is radically wrong; I am very sorry to differ with you in Opinion--But the Delegates of N Hampshire & Rhode Island declared in Congress, that their States would not comply--& I think that when they know that Masstts. & Connectt. are not call'd upon who are equally defect. in their Compliment as those two States; that they will not be at a very great partial Expence. However it is done.(5) We have done another very wrong Thing for Baron Steuben. We have referred a Motion to the Financier to take Order for 2,400 Dollrs. in favr. of the Baron on Acct. of Pay. We have repealed all former Allowances of extra Pay, Subsistence, forage, Waggons &ca for himself & family, & ordered in Lieu thereof three hundred Dollrs. per Month.(6) It is not right. However if the Army are content with it, Amen! The Committee of the Army arrived yesterday.(7) Coll Brooks breakfasted with me this Morning. I can't now recollect all the wicked Things we have done since your Departure. Mr. Gorham has been confined for ten or twelve Days but is growing better. Mr. Lovell is now confined he has had a very disagreeable Turn of Feaver & Ague &ca. One Day about Dusk he came down from his Chamber & seemed to be in a strange Condition; the Doctr. was present. Jack insisted upon it that his Legs were so big that he could not move them. His Hands, His Head, His Body were all so big that he could not possibly stir. The Doctr. Thot he was vapoury--felt of his Pulse; & did not find them bad--he bantered him, but to no Purpose; about half an Hour after, he was taken with a most violent fit--nobody was in the Room when he was first taken--they found him in the middle of the floor  JANUARY 1, 1783  perhaps in half a Minute after he was seized. Mr. Gorhams Boy & mine seized him to prevent his injuring himself--for he Jam'd his Head against the floor & kicked most violently. The two Boys were no match for him. The Neighbourhood & the Doctr were soon rallied. After he came out of it, he was very weak & remained so for three or four Days; he seems to be getting a little better now. I have not mentioned to him the Condition he was in. It is now about two Hours since the New year commenced, therefore it is Time for me to bid you Adieu, S. Osgood [P.S.] The Judges at Trenton have determined unanimously in favor of Pennsylvania. I have not had Time by this Post to write my Brother at Salem. If you meet with Difficulty on Account of the Draft--I shall be glad to know it as soon as may be for I can make Provision for the Payment thereof. I think you will Judge that I have wrote a very moderate & decent Letter to the Secry. It was not dictated by my feelings--because I apprehend they may think differently upon a State of Facts. If they do not I shall only return a Month or two sooner for it. I wish you a happy, yes, a thousand happy New Years. Jany. 8th. Greaton, Dayton & Putnam are Brigrs General.(8) ""

The Reasons for the Sentence are not assigned--and consequently the Judgment will not Apply as a Precedent in deciding Other Cases.

  Dear Sir, January 2d 1783, Philada. I am much obliged by your last kind letter of the first of December. You are right with respect to Dr. Warrens oration. I only have the one that was pronounced in 1775 which in my opinion is the best of the whole collection.(1) The account you give of Mr Austin is truly deplorable. What a pity that so bright a sun should set so soon & what is worse set under such a cloud.(2) The evacuation of Charlestown is an event though much desired not yet authenticated. The last southern post brought some disagreeable accounts of Gen. Green being obliged to retreat but this also is not properly ascertained. You ask my opinion on the subject of Dr Whites performance.(3) I have not read it but they who have say that it puts ordination on a presbyterian footing. He is a candid catholic worthy man & most excellent citizen. I think it probable that his plan will be adopted & in that case our churches will only differ from theirs in the forms of worship. Your speaker Mr Gorham has the esteem of Congress & is reckoned a man of abilities & integrity. He has mentioned nothing about Mr  JANUARY 2, 1783  Burgess.(4) My private opinion is that he will gain nothing by applying to Congress. The inconsistency of so soon departing from their own resolution respecting British Subjects would hold them up to public view as a fickle unsteady body if they relaxed in favor of any individual however deserving. The present sense of many members is that the stronger evidence a British subject produces of his attachment to America the more fit he would be to be employed by the enemy. I know nothing of that Gentlemans character; but let it be ever so good I do not believe that Congress would break through their late resolution for his sake. If peace should be established British subjects will have the same liberties of coming to America that other Europeans have. They among them who are our freinds must not take it amiss that we cannot embrace them before that period. My private sentiment is that there are many freinds to America absolutely considered in G. Britain but, I suspect the freindship of all of them to America independent and allied to France. The last I consider as the anchor of the former & would do nothing that would in the most remote manner hurt it. The papers will inform you that negociations are going on, that a new commission is made out empowering Mr Oswald to treat with the States of America. Lord Shelburne is so double a character that I suspect his sincerity in all this. God grant I may be mistaken. With the greatest esteem & regard, I am your real freind & very humble servt, David Ramsay ""

[1783] (1) The vote of thanks to the Minister of France which passed yesterday was repealed in consequence of his havg expressed to the President a desire that no notice might be taken of his conduct as to the point in question & of the latter's communicating the same to Congress.(2) The  JANUARY 4, 1783  temper of Congress here again manifested the transient nature of their irritation agst. France. The motion of Mr. Howel put on the Secret Journal gave Congress a great deal of vexation. This expedient for baffling his scheme of raising a ferment in his state & exposing the foreign transactions was adopted only in the last resort; it being questioned by some whether the articles of confederation warranted it.(3) The answer to the note of the French Minister passed unanimously & was a further testimony of the abatement of the effects of Mr. Jay's letter &c. The proceedings of the Ct. in the dispute between Cont. & Pa. were after debates as to the meaning of the confederation in directing such proceeding to be lodged above (4) the acts of Congress entered at large on the Journals.(5) It was remarked that the Delegates from Cont. particularly Mr. Dyer were more captious on the occasion than was consistent with a perfect acquiescence in the decree.

  Monday Jany. 6th. [1783] (1) The Memorial from the army was laid before Congress and referred to a grand Committee.(2) This reference was intended as a mark of the important light in which the memorial was viewed. Mr. Berkley (3) having represented some inconveniencies incident to the plan of a Consular Convention between France & U. S., particularly the restriction of Consuls from trading, & his letter having been committed, a report was made proposing that the Convention should for the present be suspended. To this it had been objected that as the convention might already be concluded such a step was improper;  JANUARY 6, 1783  and as the end might be obtained by authorising the Minister at Versailles to propose particular alterations that it was unnecessary. By Mr. M[adison] it had been moved that the report should be postponed to make place for the consideration of an instruction & authority to the sd. Minister for that purpose; and this motion had in consequence been brought before Congress.(4) On this day the business was revived. The sentiments of the members were various, some wishing to suspend such part of the convention only as excluded Consuls from commerce; others thought this exclusion too important to be even suspended; others again thought the whole ought to be suspended during the War; & others lastly contending that the whole ought to be new modelled; the Consuls having too many privileges in some respects, & too little power in others. It was observable that this diversity of opinions prevailed chiefly among the members who had come in since the Convention had been passed in Congress; the members originally present adhering to the views which then governed them.(5) The subject was finally postponed; 8 States only being represented & 9 being requisite for such a question. Even to have suspended the convention after it had been proposed to the Court of France & possibly acceded to would have been indecent and dishonorable; and at a juncture when G. B. was courting a commercial intimacy, to the probable uneasiness of France, of very mischevous tendency. But experience constantly teaches that new members of a public body do not feel the necessary respect or responsibility for the acts of their predecessors, and that a change of members & of circumstances often proves fatal to consistency and stability of public measures. Some conversation in private by the old members with the most judicious of the new in this instance has abated the fondness of the latter for innovations, and it is even problematical whether they will be again urged. In the evening of this day the grand Committee met and agreed to meet again the succeeding evening for the purpose of a conference with the Superintendt. of Finance. ""

  Dear Sir. Philadelphia Jany. 6th. 1783 I have not had either Opportunity or a Subject on which to write you of late. In my last (1) informed you that I expected to have been in Boston this Winter. It is now a Matter of Uncertainty. After Genl. Mifflin, Mr. Nash & myself had left Philadelphia & rode about Eight or Ten Miles, Mr. Nash accidentally mentioned that he had seen a private Letter before he left the City informing that Virginia had repealed their Impost Law. We immediately enquired thro whom the Information came & found the Channel to be so good that there could remain but little Doubt as to the Fact. This convinced us all that it was in vain to go to Rhode Island till the Matter was fully ascertained. We returned rather chagrined & informed Congress of the Reason who were entirely ignorant of the Matter except three or four Members. That Body approved of our Conduct, & in about two Hours after the southern Post arrived & confirmed the Intelligence. This has at present put an End to the Deputation's proceeding. Mr. Morris differs from us in Opinion. He thinks we ought to have gone forward. But Congress seem to be unanimous that it is best, at least to postpone it for the present. I am extremely distress'd with the embarrassed Situation of Congress. They must finally be borne down. It is impossible for them to hold their Station if the War continues unless they are furnished with more ample & liberal Means to carry it on. Extremes frequently produce their opposites too much or too little Power in Congress are both ineligible. You know their Powers as to the great national Objects under their Direction. However it may not be amiss to suggest the probable Consequences which may take Place from the present weak & debilitated Constitution of the united States & the almost entire Loss of Confidence in Congress in a great Measure arising therefrom. Many of the Systems with the Trompery of paper Money are all done away by Congress. Their late Systems have operated well. The Arrangements are prudent & lessen inconceivably the Expences of the united States. Congress have much to say for themselves on this Head within the last Eighteen Months. But if they cannot by prudent Management obtain the Confidence of the People & the several Legislatures. If they will not Join heartily in supporting Congress, Disunion & Dissolution can scarcely be avoided. This Event however some may think of it lightly is a very serious Matter & must be pregnant with infinite Mischief; how far European Powers may become interested in the Scene is impossible to divine. But I think the probable Danger is much against us. We begin to open to a new Scene of Politicks a brittish Interest is strongly suspected even among those who are zealous for the Independence of these States. It is foreseen that at the close of  JANUARY 6, 1783  the War a strong french & brittish Interest will become exceeding manifest. The french Court undoubtedly expect & intend to claim as much Merit as Decency will allow of for their Aids & Assistance. We surely ought as a sensible & generous People to acknowledge fully the important & beneficial Consequences of those Aids. But as a People conscious of our own sovereign Rights & as brave as generous, we ought never to fetter ourselves with an unnecessary Byass towards any Power on Earth. We ought to think & act as an independent People. But this I fear is not possible. If we may not charge many in important Stations with the most humiliating Servility--We may at least say that if their Conduct is the Result of Deliberation, if it is a fair Index of their Intentions, it does not wear the Appearance of an independent Mind. None but an F____n (2) can be blind to the Politicks of the Court of V____s either his Understanding or his Heart must be impeached unless we suppose all our other M____s distitute of Sagacity & Goodness of Intentions--for they have all fallen into the same Channel of thinking & have viewed Things in a very different Light from that M____r. This Mr. Jay informs us plainly is the Case with him & the D____r. And if he perseveres in his independent Way of thinking, it will not be long before Suspicions Insinuations, & Party Interest will lessen his Importance there. But these are very secret Matters & Honor forbids my mentioning several Things that have a strange Aspect. Two powerful Interests opposed to each other which may be the Case & a Dissolution of our Union will probably be Sources of as many Calamities as the present War. I think it is for our Interest to be united notwithstanding some States may & will finally bear a very unequal Part of the present Contest. But they will not wish to seek for a Remedy which would encreace the Injury. Their alternative must be to choose the least Evil; and of all temporal Evils War is among the greatest. Our national Debt is about thirty Millions of Dollars--near Twenty five Millions of which is due to the Inhabitants of the united States. Seventeen Millions & probably a little more, are upon Interest--so that Twelve hundred thousand Dollars is a Computation low enough for the annual Interest. That Sum Congress have required for the sole Purpose of discharging the Interest to March 1783--can you point out in what Way Congress can do Justice to their Creditors & obtain about 6,000,000 of Dollrs. for the Support of their Army & the civil List. I do not think our national Debt together with the Debts of the several States so enormous that the Abilities of the united States equally exerted are not or rather will not be fully competent to the Discharge thereof. But I fear that the national Debt never will be discharged upon the Principles of the Confederation unless Peace makes a much greater Alteration in some of the States than I have any Reason to expect. That they will assume a new Face soon after the Close of the War cannot be doubted But that they will be heartily & Jointly dis-  posed to comply with the Requisitions of Congress a future Day will alone determine. No rational Man can suppose that during the War the united States can raise seven Million & a half of Dollars annualy (which is the Amount of the Estimates upon the lowest possible Calculation) in the common Way of Taxation. Some other more energetic & productive Plan must be adopted or the oeconomical Plans of Congress must fail in the Execution. And if they should fail before Peace is established the Consequences are very much to be dreaded. Peace may or may not be made this Winter says Mr. J____ in a Letter of the 13th of last October.(3) But the Brittish Commission to Mr. Oswald to treat with the Commissioners of the thirteen united States of America viz. Newhampshire & so on--appears to me to have in some Measure closed the Dispute with Respect to our Independence: & several agree with me in Opinion that this being no longer a Question to be solved by the Sword the Court of St. James will be in Haste for a Peace. That they are seriously and anxiously disposed for such an Event appears from good Authority. And Should they be wise enough to make a very liberal Peace with us & cede all their Rights to our extensive Claims to Territory & grant us the same Priviledges in the Fisheries which we formerly enjoyed & also a Freedom of Trade in their Ports to be reciprocal--should they be governed by such truely wise & political Principles for themselves of which there is much Reason to suppose they are more sensibly impressed than they have ever before been. What will clogg the Wheels of Peace--surely America looks with the utmost Anxiety for that happy Event. Heaven forbid that it should be otherwise than happy. It is natural to suppose that if great Britain acknowledges our Independence, she will make Peace with us upon such liberal Terms as to obliterate as much as possible a Remembrance of past Injuries. But is this a Conduct in them to be wish'd for by, & that will be pleasing to every European Power? It is a political Question & there may be many political Manoevres before it can be fully answered. The more contracted & limited Congress find their Powers as to the very important Objects that fall under their general Direction in a Time of War, the more dependent that Body is made, the more servile & obedient will they become to foreign Influence. How can it be otherwise? If we cannot carry on the War ourselves, it matters not whether it it is owing to the Inability of the People, or to the Weakness of our Constitution--either of them will oblige Congress to have recourse to similar Measures. They must to their own Humiliation solicit foreign Aid in either Case And I am fully convinced that Congress have been really necessitated to sollicit Aids in the most humble Terms more from a Want of Energy in their own Constitution than from the real Inability of the People. We have reason to beleive that the \""ultimately to govern\"" &ca. originated in Part from this Cause. The States to the southward of this saw plainly their   Danger. They were perswaded that the Power of the Union was at that Time insufficient for their Protection. They deprecated a Submission to Great Britain & to avoid it saw no other Way but by courting foreign Aid at the dear Expence of their own Honor & Dignity. This burning of Incense at a strange Alter is political Blasphemy against the Sovereignty of America. But this is the Course of human Nature when we see our Danger & are unable to help ourselves we generally apply for Assistance. And thus a Congress without Power may be the Escurial (4) of American Dignity. The above Reasons have lately been urged in Justification of passing that base, servile Clause. The Servility ought to be had in the greatest Detestation even if it was not possible for us to receive any Injury by it. But however in this particular Instance, the above Reasons are ostensible at this Time. I don't recollect that they were urged with much Warmth. Genl. Ward may recollect better the general Course of the Business, it pass'd in about two Days after I entered Congress. I think the true was this, & always shall be in the Opinion Mr. Adams was sole Commissioner for Peace. The Count de V____s (5) found him by no Means a pliable Man. There had been a Warm Dispute between him & Mr. Adams & the Count had declared to Mr. Adams that he would never write to him again--this I take to be the true Reason & the others such as the Weakness of the southern Governments & the extremely embarassed Situation of our Finances are now very plausible Excuses. They were at that Time both true. But it may be remarked that we have not received any Consideration for the Surrender. Mr. Laurens had finished his Negociation long before & we have received no Subsidy or Loan, since what he obtained. The Count de Grasse was ordered to the Chesapeak before that could reach france & you are a Judge of the Rest. The Powers of Congress as to internal Government are very limited but as to external Matters such as Treaties and Alliances they are very extensive. The first being found by Experiment incompetent the last will be resorted to. And in this Way the United States may laid prostrate at the Foot of a foreign Power either from pretended Necessity or political Intrigue. If it had been possible to have given more of the one & less of the other our Honor might have been preserved more inviolate. I wish there may never be an Occasion for another War after this has terminted. But I think we ought to get thro this as honorably as we can, by endeavoring to establish such Systems for discharging the Debts that have necessarily accrued as to leave finally our Honor & Honesty unimpeach'd. It is in vain to triffle & piddle about the Matter. If Congress cannot discharge they must not contract Debts--they must not obtain any foreign Loans. They must not hold out any longer vain & delusory Promises to the Army. It is impossible for them to exist with only one or two Months Pay in two Years.  The Deputation from the Army is here consisting of Genl. McDougal, Colo. Ogden & Colo. Brooks. I have had much Conversation with our Colonel.(6) Genl. McDougal & he made a long Evening with Mr. Gorham and myself. Two of the Principal Matters they have in Charge were pretty largely discuss'd, which were relative to the Arrears of Pay due & the half Pay. I think upon the whole of their Conversation that with Regard to the first they are content to have their Accounts settled by Congress: but that they will positively require better Security for the Payment of the Principal & Interest than Congress can possibly give. They otherwise will not take the Securities. Can an honest Man blame them for it? Specie Certificates of the United States I am informed are sold here by Brokers at Discount of five sixths. The Pay due to the Army amounts to between four or five Millions of Dollars--should that Sum in Certificates be added to what is already in the Hands of Individuals without any Funds to discharge it, the Discount must encrease rapidly, so that the Receivers, or at least a great Number of them would be about as well of without, as with them. The Security will be a Point on which they will be clear and determined--& there can be no reasonable Objection against it. The other Point relative to half Pay is a very tender Matter with them. We agreed that as they were empowered to make a Compromise with Congress the Matter had better be taken up in this Line than to refer it to the States. I prefer it for this plain Reason, that if any State has more than it's Proportion of Officers there will be no Injury arising to such State on that Account. I have lately found that several States are so fully convinced that they have more than a due Proportion that they would by no Means vote for a Referrence unless Provision is made to Remedy the Injury. It is probable that Congress may be a little more generous & perhaps ought to be more so than some of the States would be; I am very sincerely disposed to do Justice to those Officers who have borne a great variety of severe Tryals. It would be the Heighth of Ingratitude to forget them at the Close of the War. However some of the Sentiments I advanced in a former Letter have Reason for their Foundation.(7) Indeed Colo. Brooks has confess'd it with Respect to the Officers who retired in 1780. But He says the Promise must be adhered to now whether founded in Reason or not. Twelve States were present in Congress when the Promise was made to those retiring Officers. Six States were in Favor of it--five against it--& one divided. This was certainly incomplete as to the Object of it because the Appropriation of the Money must be made annually And it is a Question how far Moral Obligation requires that any of those States should alter their Sentiments when a Vote for Appropriation is taken. New Jersey have instructed their Delegates not to consent. But the Want of Validity in the Promise has never been started in Congress & I apprehend it   never will be. It has been effectually tried in this Way, When the last Requisition for 1783 was made the half Pay for the above retired Officers was inserted in the Estimate--but it was impossible after various Manoevres to obtain nine States to vote in Favor of it. I think it was very Right for Massachusetts not to meddle with the half Pay. I wish it might be settled in a continental Way so as to give general Satisfaction. But I fear this cannot be done. If we attempt & do not succeed, we must then endeavor to have a Referrence made. I have enclosed you a Copy of their Address & Petition which is not so brilliant as some of theirs which I have seen. What the Result will be I cannot tell. I will drop the above Subject to give you a short History of the Conduct of Mr. Howell who by his late Conduct has put Congress or rather many of the Members into an ill Humor with him. An Extract of a Letter was inserted in Edes's Paper under the Providence Head dated the 2d of Novr. said to be wrote from a Gentleman in Philadelpa. &ca.(8) That Extract it was apparent must have been wrote by a Member of Congress or some of their confidential Servants. Indeed no Body doubted who the Author was. It contained a very unjust & unfair Representation of Facts relative to foreign Loans & was levelled particularly against the States passing the Impost. It also contained a Matter which Congress had enjoined to be kept Secret being specially requested so to do, which was that of a nothern Power proposing to be allied with the united States. The Misrepresentation of Facts & the divulging a Secret were thot of sufficient Importance to have a Committee appointed to Report what was necessary to be done therein. The Committee reported that the Extract of the Letter contained a Misrepresentation of Facts which was highly derogatory to the Honor of the United States & greatly injurious to their Finances &ca. And that the Secretary for foreign Affairs be directed to write to the Executive of Rhode Island to investigate the Author in Order for farther Proceedings &ca. This passed there being but six States in Congress then besides Rhode Island the Vote of that State was necessary to make it valid. Mr. Howell made no Objection to it & thereby condemned himself. The next Morning after he thot proper to declare in his Place that he was the Author of the Extract & vindicated the Sentiments it contained--A Motion was immediately made that the Secretary for foreign Affairs be directed not to write to the Executive of Rhode Island &ca Mr. Howell a Delegate in Congress from sd. State having acknowledged &ca. This would have brot his Name upon the Journals which he & his Colleague opposed very warmly & others as warmly insisted upon it--some endeavored to compromise the Matter by only inserting Information having been received &ca. This Debate finished the Day without any Decision. In this State it lay two or three Days when Mr. H____ call'd for it who had prepared a long Protest against Congress as a Preamble to a Motion in Order to bring   it upon the Journals of Congress by the Yeas & Nays--after the original Motion was read he moved to postpone it in Order to introduce his Motion which he read in his Place. It is undoubtedly the most extraordinary Piece that has ever appeared upon the Journals (I have enclosed you a Copy)(9) & probably excited some Indignation--had he not read that Paper, I think it was the apparent Disposition of Congress not to have entered his Name on the Journals. But this disappeared at once--little was said on the Motion excepting that his greatest Enemy could not be more gratified nor wish for a greater Advantage over him than by having that inserted on the Journals. The Yeas & Nays were called & Mr. H____ figures away at large upon the Journals. His Aim has been to make it appear that Congress have persecuted him & they have aim'd at having nothing to do with him. The Secretary is simply directed to furnish the Executive of Rhode Island with an account of our foreign Applications for Loans & the Success they have met with in Order that the Truth may appear. After Congress gave this Direction to the Secretary for foreign Affairs Mr. H____ notwithstanding he is releived has thot it necessary to continue here to collect Materials for his Justification. He has been very troublesome & taken up much of the Time of Congress in endeavoring to obtain a great Number of detached Passages & Extracts from the Letters of our foreign Ministers. He asserted in the Extract published that the Credit of the united States is daily encreasing in Europe & that Congress have fail'd in no late Application for Loans. The last is not true for Congress have not from first to last succeeded completely in any Application whatever. To Support the first Part, he requests an Extract from a Letter of Doctr. Franklin's (10) which was received four or five Weeks after Mr. H____'s Letter was published. The Doctr. mentions the Satisfaction that the public Rejoicings here, for the Birth of the Dauphin gave to his most Christian Majesty, & also that the Conduct of Congress & several of the States in declaring their Sentiments with Regard to any Overtures for Peace which should not be perfectly consistent with the Alliance, were highly approved of. And then observes that the Reputation of Congress is rising throughout Europe; or something to this Effect. But it is evident from his Letter that he does not speak of that particular Kind of Credit which will enable Congress to procure Loans. But their Firmness & the Probability of their final Success makes them of more Consideration than they have heretofore been. This may be true; and Congress may not be able to procure a single Dollr. in Europe on Loan other wise than from the royal Treasury of France which is altogether a political Matter, & as far as may appear to be absolutely necessary will be afforded us whether we can discharge the Debt or not. But we are told by Doctr. Franklin & the Count de V____s that we must not expect any more pecuniary Aid from that   Court. It is true that by the last Letters from Mr. Adams (11) he had obtain'd from Individuals about £80,000 Sterlg. The Interest of which commenced many Months ago as also for about £100,000 Sterg more the Interest of which Sums yearly must be paid with Punctuality or our Credit in Europe with Individuals will sink entirely instead of rising. How this can be done without appropriating a Part of the Capital for that Purpose I know not. That we have fail'd in no late Application for Loans is a wicked Misrepresentation. It is calculated to give an exceeding bad Opinion of Congress to all their suffering Creditors. It conveys an Idea to the public that Congress can obtain as much Money as they stand in need of & that the Facility with which they can procure it ought rather to be check'd than encouraged by establishing of permanent Funds. Would you, or any other Person beleive from that Representation that Congress have not obtain'd any Money in Europe for nearly two Years excepting what Mr. Adams has obtain'd. Mr. Laurens's Negociation is the latest Money we have obtaind from the Court of V____s which is little short of two years notwithstanding we have made two very pressing Applications since--one of them particularly long enough ago to have recd. an Answer. Doctr. F____n was so strongly impress'd with an Opinion that we must fail in the Application that he postponed it for farther Directions--which he received in positive Terms. As to the Court of Madrid Congress I hope will never make another Application there: after the unwearied & pressing Solicitations of Mr. J__y for many months to that Court for about £25,000 Sterg after being triffled with & encouraged from Time to Time, he was finally obliged to the great Dishonor of the United States to suffer to be protested Bills drawn on him to that small Amount. The Count de Vergennes writes in the most pointed Terms against our placing Dependence upon Assistance there. Mr. Adams writes very discouraging as to his future Prospects. Spain will not assist us in this Way. In what part of Europe then is our Credit so well established that we can make Applications for Loans with any Prospect of Success? I know not. Indeed I think it is not fair & honest for Congress to ask a foreign Individual to loan them money in their present State of Imbecility Notwithstanding the above State of Facts, which are literally true. Mr. H____l persists in declaring that his Sentiments can be supported from the Letters of our foreign Ministers & is very assiduously attempting to have a great Part of their Correspondence in his Possession as well as that of the public by introducing them or such Parts as he conceives will best answer his Purpose as Preambles to a Motion & calling for the Yeas & Nays to bring them upon the Journals so that he may have an attested Copy which Congress have not usually given. He left us this Week, & you may probably see him figuring away in the Providence Gazette.  The Hints I have given relative to the Disposition of G____ B____ for Peace must be communicated with Confidence--for that Disposition appeared before the Issue of the Attack upon Gibralter could be known. We have received no foreign Communications since that Garrison has been releived. How far this favourable Issue may tend to abate her pacific Views is uncertain. The Prospect of Peace when the last official Letters were wrote was more flattering than has ever been before. But Mr. J__y who had a much better Opportunity to Judge of the Probability of the Event than we have, is doubtful. \""It may, or may not be this Winter.\""(1)2 It will not be safe to place much Dependance at present on an Event so extremely agreeable, as that of a speedy Close of the present War would be. About Ten Days since a serious Motion was made by Mr. Clarke & seconded by Mr. Rutledge to appoint a Committee to revise our Instructions to our Peace Commissioners.(13) The Reason therefor was openly assigned, which was to repeal the Clause subjecting them to be governed by the Advice & Opinion &ca. A Committee was appointed but the Report terminated in a very different Object. I must acknowledge I am at a very great Loss about it myself in the present Crisis of Matters. As we have committed ourselves in a Way which discovered the most extraordinary & unlimited Confidence It may probably be attended with more disagreeable Consequences to revoke than to continue it. This is the Opinion of several, (& there is some Reason for it) who are extremely mortified that it was ever done. It is, farther, evident that a Vote in Congress could not yet be obtain'd & if not, it may be a Question whether it is good Policy to push the Matter. The Firmness of our Ministers must be depended on--And my Confidence therein is greatly encreased of late. I am really wearied in writing this long Letter & I doubt not you will be much more so, before you have read it, & the Enclosures. Pardon the Prolixity & beleive me to be very sincerely, Your most humble Servant, Samuel Osgood ""

11431,dg019406,1783,Samuel Wharton to John Cook,"""Samuel Wharton to John Cook
  Sir Philadelphia January 6th. 1783. During the Recess of the General Assembly, I did myself the Honor of writing to the Vice president under Date of the 2d and 20th of November, and the 23d of last Month; And now I forward to you some pages of the printed Journals of Congress, continued to the 12th of September, and material Extracts from these, which are not finished. In about six Weeks, The Secretary of Congress tells me, That a Volumn with an Index, will be published, extending the procedings to the 3d of November. I shall be attentive to transmit this Volumn, as soon as I can procure it. Congress are, and have been exceedingly embarrassed by the urgent, and reitterated Demands made upon Them by the publick Creditors, holding Certificates, and liquidated Accounts; strengthened by Memorials from the Assembly of Pensylvania; in behalf of such of Them, as are Citizens of that State, and a few days ago, A Committee from the Army arrived in this City to request among other Matters, a settlement of their, and the Soldiers Accounts, An Advance of part of the Amount of Them, and a satisfactory Assurance of half Pay. Their Representation is not yet delivered,(1) and Therefore I can only give at present, What I understand to be some of the Outlines of their intended Application. It was hoped, That the Assembly of Rhode Island would have approved a Bill for laying a Duty of 5 per Cent on all foreign Goods &c, imported into that Goverment, But to the very great Concern, and Disapointment of Congress, They have unanimously refused to comply with their Recommendation. This induced Congress to appoint a Deputation, consisting of a Delegate from each of the States of Massachusets Bay, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina, and order Them to proceed to Rhode Island, and endeavour, not only to answer the Objections of the Assembly, But describe in the most pointed Language the unhappy Consequences, That would, probably result from their Denial of the solicited Impost. The Deputies were furnished with Instructions, and Observations, drawn with Judgment and precission; And it was expected, They would have prevailed over such partial Reasons, as apparently originated from Locality. The Gentlemen proceeded upon their Mission, and had gone a few Miles from this City, When a Delegate from Vir JANUARY 6, 1783  ginia acquainted Congress, He had just received a Letter from a Person of Authority in that State, informing, That the Legislature of the Goverment had repealed their Impost Law. This News much increased the Difficulties of the national Council; But as it has not had an official Account of the Repeal of the Law in Question (Tho' fully convinced of the Fact,) Nor the Reasons for doing it, Congress have not yet deliberated upon the Measures, which would be expedient for Them to take. The Deputies, who were on their Journey to Rhode Island, hearing that Virginia had acted in the above Manner, returned to this Town. When the Conduct of that State is considered, I hope I may be permitted to say, that the repealing of their Impost Law at this Time, is very extraordinary, and especialy, as She has paid little, or no part of the Requisition of 1782, had not one Soldier in the great Army last Campaign, and only a few hundreds in the seperate, southern Army, and still with unexampled Perversness, continues her futile Claim to the immense Western Region. Pardon Sir, these Remarks; many more pertinent, and important, cannot escape the Attention and penetration of the Honorable Council, and Yourself. If I may hazard an Opinion, I should apprehend, That the first Step Congress would persue, would be to send a Deputation to Virginia, and another to Rhode Island, for the purpose of trying to obivate such Objections as these States respectively make, and at the same Time strenuously to represent, The impelling Necessity of an immediate Compliance with Desires, frequently, and fervidly made. When this is done, Let the Issue of the Mission be what it may, Congress will have the Consulation of not having left any Means unessayed, which in their Apprehension would redound to the Service of their Consituents. Hence They can with a respectful Confidence, assert their Vigilance and Fidelity, at least, in this Instance to the States, and to the poor, suffering Creditors of the publick. As soon as Congress are possessed of the Reasons, which induced the Legislature of Virginia to repeal the Law alluded to, I shall take the earliest Opportunity of laying Them before the House. The Behaviour of Virginia and Rhode Island will have a very unfavourable Effect upon Foreign Loans, as Holland knows, That Congress have no fixed Revenue, by which They are enabled punctualy to pay the Interest, accruing on Money, They have borrowed, or may borrow. In England and France it is quite the Reverse. There the Lender, Whether a Foreigner, or Citizen is paid faithfully, and quarterly his Interest. It is thought, the Dutch had heard of the Indisposition of Rhode Island to an Impost Law; for by Advices written in October, We learn, That the Loan, which I mentioned in my Dispatch of the 23d of that Month, had advanced no more, than five thousand Guilders. You   will be pleased to recollect Sir, That on the 16th of October, Congress called upon the States, Only for two Millions of Dollars, as part of six Millions for the Service of the Year 1783. This they did from a Belief, That four Millions, exclusive of the Money, which Mr. Adams might borrow, would be obtained in other parts of Europe. Should They be disapointed, The States will be obliged to raise four Million of Dollars, or as much, as shall not be procured on Loan. This shows, how much those States, which have passed Impost Laws, will be injuriously affected by the recent Transactions of Virginia and Rhode Island, And allow Me Sir to add, That if these States do not soon change their present System of Policy, It will essentialy wound, if not, perhaps, destroy our rising, national Credit, founded upon the prospect of a solid, and productive Fund, wholy in the power of Congress, and to be placed by Them, under the Superintendance of an expert, and able Financier. In whatever Light I view this Subject, I am grieved, and astonished. Whether I contemplate it as the hopeful Basis for European Loans, or as a Fund, whereby the Interest of Foreign, and domestick Debts might have been punctually paid, and the States exempted in a large Degree, from the irksome Task of laying immediate, and direct Taxes upon their Citizens. This is a very unpleasant Topick, and one, which with much Reluctance I write upon, But my Duty to the Council supercedes every other Consideration. I feel the Obligation of detailing Facts, as They are, and I trust the honorable Council will approve, or at least excuse my explicit Communications. The French Fleet commanded by the Marquis de Vadruil has sailed from Boston, and taken with it the Army, lately under the Command of the Count de Rochambeau, excepting fifteen hundred Men, including the Legion, now at Wilmington. Congress have received the strongest Assurance, That if there should be occasion for the Return of this Army, It shall be here in Time, and that a sufficient, naval Force will be dispatched from the West Indies, for the protection of the American Commerce during the Winter. Before this Time, I flatter myself the Minister for foreign Affairs has sent to the Vice President a Copy of the King of Great Britain, his last Commission to Mr. Oswall, for the purpose of treating for a Peace or Truce with the Commissioners (at Versailes) of the United States of America.(2) From Appearances, there is good Reason to think, The British Cabinet is more sincerely disposed for Peace, Than They have been, any Time since the Earl of Shelburne has been prime Minister; But the next Advices from France will greatly elucidate several Matters, which are at present enveloped in some Shades of Obscurity. There is a Diversity of Opinions respecting the Commission, granted to Mr. Oswall, as how far the British Nation is committed by their   Sovereign's authorising Him, explicitly to treat with the Commissioners of the United States. Some contend, That it is wholy illusory, and That it ought to have designated the several foederal Goverments in the Manner done by the Articles of Confederation, and the Acknowledgments of France, and the United Provinces of the Netherlands; Whilst others insist, That the Commission is at least an implied Recognition of the Independence of the United States, and that neutral Powers may safely authorise their Subjects to employ their Vessels, and other property in Commerce with Us: and Indeed, There are other persons, even of high Rank and Estimation, Who maintain, That a Treaty, in Consequence of the preceding Commission was carrying on, (having perfect Equality for it's Foundation) between Great Britain and the United States. It will not be long before We shall be at a Certainty as to the real Intention of the Enemy; and in the meantime, it will be a most serious Object for Congress to consider And adopt, The wisest Measures for the full Information of their Ministers, relative to the future Trade of these States with the West India Islands, as well those, which belong to the English, as those of the French &c. By the Treaty of Amity and Commerce with France, there is no specifick Provission for Trade with the Islands. This is a Consideration of great national Import, particularly to the Middle States, and calls for the Exertion of Gentlemen, well informed in the Science of Commerce, combined with Policy. In this Light, Congress see it, and will devote the utmost Attention to it. I must now take the Liberty of desiring the Favor of the honorable Council to recur to my Letter of the 2d of November to his Honour the Vice president, and the Extracts from the Journals of Congress herewith sent, as therein will be found, what passed upon the Acceptance of the Cession of New York. Much Time and Pains were requisite for removing Objections in different Delegates, as the opposing, and large States had made strong Impressions upon Them, but by Assiduity, and private Arguments, deduced from Justice and policy, and corroborated by historical Truths, We at last prevailed. Upon the Day of Decission, It was remarkable, That the Majority sat still, and only called, and recalled for the Vote, which did not a little irritate the Minority. The Intention of the successful States in Congress, was to have carried Resolutions through the House, of the purport of those, which I mentioned in my Letter of the 2d of November; But unfortunately the Delegates of Connecticut were obliged to attend the Trial between that State and Pennsylvania, and several other Delegates returned to their respective Governments. At present Maryland and Georgia are not represented, But the former, We suppose, will have it's Members  JANUARY 7, 1783  here by the Beginning of next Month. There are many new Delegates in Congress, who are much uninformed upon the Subject of the vacant and unapropriated Lands at the Revolution, and Therefore it is judged imprudent to move for firm and decissive Measures concerning Them, until proper Discussions have been previously had. The Magnitude of this Object, embracing Considerations of the most extensive Consequences, demands of the Congress, That they should terminate it with all prudent Dispatch, otherwise, I am persuaded, They will have abundant Cause to deplore their Neglect. I should be glad to be informed, What Distance it is from Dover to some Town on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, thro' which the post Rider now passes, as I flatter myself, if going by Dover does not much increase his travelling, I should be able to prevail upon the Post Master to direct that Route, if it should be the Wish of the Legislature. With my respectful Duty to the honorable Council, I am Sir, your Honour's most humble, and most Obt. servant, Saml. Wharton (3) ""

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia January 7th 1783 I have receved your's of the 10th Decr. by Post but as yet hear Nothing of yours wrote as early as September inclosing a Sett of Bills for 535¾ Dollars drawn by Mallett and Jewkes on Oliver Pollock.(1) Mr. Hellborn very readily agreed to pay me the Balance due to Mr. Blackledge--when I want it I shall call and receve it and that Sum with the sum that my Friend Hawkins will lend me will enable me to leave this place which I shall certainly do on or before the 1st Day of February.(2) JANUARY 7, 1783  Portrait of William Blount  In August last a Commission was granted by the Court of London to Richard Oswald Esquire of the City of London impowering him to treat for and conclude with the Colonies of North America or their Commissioners a Peace or Truce. Our Ministers at Paris refused to treat with Mr. Oswald under this Commission objecting to the Word Colonies. On the 27th September Mr. Oswald produced another Commission from the Court of London dated September 21st impowering him to treat for and conclude with the Commssioners of the Thirteen United States of North America Viz New Hampshire, Massachusets &c &c--a Truce or Peace. On the 14th of October our last Official Accounts are dated (from Paris) when and where the Peace Negociators appeared to be going on very amicably but by the same Conveyance We are informed by one of the Negociators that Notwithstanding the peaceable Aspect the Negoci[a]tions have, that he should not belive the British were sin[c]ere in what they said about Peace untill they had signed and sealed a Treaty to insure it. In this Business of Peace making there is no less than five diffrent Interests to consult and accomodate so that however sin[c]ere all Parties may be in their wishes to Compleat it, It will unavoidably be a Work of considerable time, if effected at all, And as to what will be the Event of this Business the People here are much divided in Opinion for my own part my Opinion too frequently goes with my Wishes and no Man more fervently wishes for Peace than I do. I write to no other of my Friends of this Subject and you may give as many of them Extracts from it as you please, particularly Govr. Caswell, James Coor & Docr. Guion. My Merchantile Friends I need not mention. Now to yourself & T & T. O. (3) let me say that the best informed People here are very clear that Peace will arise out of the present Negociations and of this Opinion I am, but as it is truly a Work of great Magnitude I can form no opinion as to the precise time when it may be expected. These letters of this Package will come to you from Edenton by Express & you must pay the Expence. I am &c Wm. Blount ""

  Philada. 7 Jy. 1783. Your Excy's favor of the 28 Ult.(1) was duly recd. by yesterday's mail. The extract from the Journal of Congress herewith inclosed contains the answer to the objections of R. Island agst. the impost recommended by Congress; and which was to have been enforced by a deputation to that State.920 You have been already informed of the effect which the sudden repeal of the accession of Virga. had on the measure.(3) Genl. McDougal, Col. Brooks of Massachsts. & Col. Ogden of N. Jersey arrived here some days ago, charged with a very solemn representation from the army of the grievances which oppress them. The redress principally urged is an immediate advance of part, & adequate provision for the residue of their arrears. Yr. Excelly will readily conceive the dilemma in which Congress are placed, pressed on one side by justice, humanity & the public good to fulfil engagements to which their funds are incompetent, and on [the] other left without even the resource of answering that every thing which could have been done has been done. The tribunal erected for the controversy between the States of Pa. & Connecticut have unanimously adjudged & reported to Congress that the former (4) has no right to the lands in question, and that the juris JANUARY 7, 1783  diction & pre-emption of all the territory lying within the charter boundary of Pena. & claimed by Connecticut, do of right belong to Pennsa.

  My dear Sir Philada. 7 Jany. 1783. Your favor of the 27th ult.(1) disappointed me by its silence as to the 5 Per Ct. The Governor's letter led us to hope that the subject would be resumed and the arrival of yesterday's mail was awaited with a general anxiety on that account. Not a line however in any letter public or private touches on the subject.(2) My last I hope will have led to some explanations on it.(3) The official letter to the Governor will inclose a copy of the answer to the objections of Rhode Island which was to have cooperated with the deputation to that State, if Virginia had not frustrated the whole plan by her defection. The deputation from the army which arrived here a few days ago has laid their grievances before Congress. They consist of sundry articles the capital of which are a defect of an immediate payment, and of satisfactory provision for completing the work hereafter. How either of these objects can be accomplished, and what will be the conse- JANUARY 8, 1783  quence of failure, I must leave to your own surmises. I wish the disquietude excited by the prospect was the exclusive portion of those who impede the measures calculated for redressing complaints against the justice & gratitude of the public. The Resolution of the House of Delegates against restitution of confiscated effects is subject to the remark you make.(4) The preliminary requisiton of an acknowledgment of our Independence in the most ample manner, seems to be {still more in}cautious, since it {disaccords} with {the treaty of alliance} which {admits} the {sufficiency of a tacit}(5) acknowledgment. Mr. J. is still here. I must as I apprehended postpone a copy of my extract from his remarks to the next mail,(6) to which I will add what you wish from C's (7) papers if any thing be in them. Another severe relapse has undone all his late recovery & his condition is at present as low and as alarming as it has been in any stage of his disorder.8 ""

  Sir Philadelphia January 8th. 1783. The return of my late colleague Mr Howell prevents the necessity of my writing particularly on Public affairs as he will be able to give every information in that regard. But the Duty I owe to the State obliges me to give an Account of the extraordinary proceedings in Congress towards that gentleman. To do which it is necessary in the first place to inform, that a large majority of the members of Congress, had the most sanguine views of obtaining the proposed Continental Impost of 5 per Cent, which was held out by them as the only means, of restoring Public Credit, of prevent- JANUARY 8, 1783  ing a Disunion of the States--and saving the Country from immediate ruin. In short it was extolled as the infallible, grand Political Catholicon, by which every evil was to be avoided, and every advantage derived. Of consequence every thing done in Opposition to that darling measure placed the doer in the most obnoxious point of view. This was Mr. Howell's situation at my arrival, which, I have had the honor to share a part of the burthen. From circumstances it was soon obvious that the favorers, and expectants of that measure--considered him as the chief stumbling stone in the way to their wishes--and directly after intelligence Arrived in this City, that the Assembly of the State of Rhode Island & Providence Plantations had rejected the Impost, (and previous to the Arrival of any Official Account thereof) the proceedings contained in the Extract from the Journals No. 1--took place (1)--and the same day, Decemr 6th a Deputation was appointed to go to Rhode Island, to urge a compliance with the Impost--by the latter, the design of the former was very evident. But prudence dictated silence in regard to the proceedings--until a further progress should determine in what manner the gathering storm would fall. On the 12th of December, Mr. Collins gave the Letter of the Speaker of the Lower house of Assembly, of the State, to the President of Congress--which being read, the Motion & proceedings, was made and took place, as in the Extract of the Journals, No. 3 (2)--and the same day the Committee above mentioned reported, as by the Extract No. 2 of that day appears.(3) It was now beyond a doubt that the proceedings originated in a fixed design to ruin Mr. Howell's credit & Character with the State he served--and thereby destroy that influence, he was supposed to have in Opposing the Impost, their favourite Object. To prevent further trouble, Mr. Howell after deliberating upon the matter, avowed himself to be the writer of a Letter from which it was probable the Extract referr'd to in the report was taken--and averred the Facts therein Stated to be true, as could be shewn from the Letters &c on the files of Congress. During this progress--the deputation were preparing for their Tour. A committee by appointment, had drawn up a very lengthy performance, wherein a State of Public Affairs foreign & domestic, was laboriously wrought up to the liking of a Majority of Congress--who received & approved it, and of which I shall say nothing more at present, as I mean to forward a Copy thereof as soon as it can be procured. In the mean time sundry Letters were received from Europe--which it was declared necessary should be kept secret, and many transactions, respecting the deputation, wore an aspect which I could not reconcile to my own feelings. Secrecy was enjoined upon Members of Congress, in Matters public in the City--and daily publishing in the   Newspapers. Until I was obliged to declare upon the floor, that in matters where the necessity therefor could not be pointed out, and which I deemed Interesting to the State I had the honor to represent to be informed of--I should not hold myself bound by a majority--from making the necessary Communications thereof to my constituents. As a circumstantial detail of the many Particulars which took place during the prosecution of my Colleague would draw out a Letter to too great a Length, I must beg leave to refer generally to the extracts, herewith enclosed, and will mention such things only, as tend to explain them, and such further proceedings, of which Copies cannot be procured. On the 18th of December a Motion was before the house for repealing the resolution for the Secretary for foreign Affairs to write to the State, requesting the Author of sd Letter to be given up as it was said in the Motion, \""Mr. Howell a delegate from the State of Rhode Island, having Acknowledged himself the Author\"" &c. It would appear by a motion thus expressed that Mr Howell not only acknowledged himself the Author thereof, but that he submitted to the Stigma, the Committee had fixed upon it in their report which was entered on the Journals. Therefore this was warmly opposed by Mr. Howell, and in which I supported him but when the members seemed determined to bring his name on the Journals in that disagreable view. Mr. Howell then offered his declaration & protest which appears in the Extract inclosed No. 2.(4) And tho' from the first it was my fixed intent to support my Colleague so far as I could with truth & Justice--Yet I felt a reluctance at bringing on the Journals, what must place Congress in a view--which was painful to me. And after seconding his motion, I desired him to withdraw it to make way for an Amendment which I wished to make to the motion first before the house--he withdrew it--and I moved the Amendment in the words following. \""Mr Howell having acknowledged himself to be the author of a Letter from which he supposes the Extract to have been taken, and that when he wrote the same, he believed and still believes the representations therein made to be consistent with matters of Fact which may be proved by Authentic Letters & documents on the files of Congress.\"" After waiting the usual time, the president informed me I was not seconded. At this moment I must confess I felt from a variety of Passions which were thereby excited--an Anxiety I was never before sensible of on any Occasion. It appeared that the ruin of my Colleague, was irrevocably fixed, and determined on. It now became necessary--as the only resource, that he should renew his motion, which he did, and was seconded and Calling the yeas & nays, brought it upon the Journals.  In Consequence of this another Committee was appointed upon us both--which and their report given in on the 18 Decr. is in Extract No. 2--by this the Secretary for foreign Affairs is to transmit to the State--together with the doings of Congress \""an Authenticated State of the several Applications for foreign Loans, and the result thereof.\"" Apprehensive whether the same turn of thinking wch. actuated the first committee in their report--might not affect in stating those matters--(apart from other & personal Considerations) And judging it would be more satisfactory to your Excellency and the Assembly to have the Letters & papers themselves, wherby to form a State conformable to your Judgments--rather than to take the Constructions, comments, glosses, & Colourings of either party every leisure hour Until the 2nd day of January was taken up in procuring a knowledge of the Letters &c necessary to be forwarded--on this Occasion, in addition to what was already Ordered. Which being summed up in the form of a Resolution--I moved it, seconded by Mr. Collins and the yeas & nays being called--various manoevres were tried to prevent its effect, but in vain. Until I was surprized by a motion to transfer the Motions, with the subsequent proceedings to the secret Journals, which was carried, altho' the Motion did not upon a scrutiny contain any thing under injunction of secrecy, nor related to any matter pointed out by the Articles of Confederation--as the subjects for those Journals. It would have given me great satisfaction to have been able to forward a Resolve of the purport of (No. 4)--but of this by the proceedings above mentioned I am prevented.(5) Discouraged from a further trial Mr. Howell set out to return on the 6th Instant. Although by these matters his stay has been protracted about Two weeks, yet I cannot doubt but your Excellency & the Honorable Assembly will be with me in Opinion that the time has been spent, in discharging a duty, and for the Honor and Interest of the State. Thereby a Capital & I hope fatal stroke has been given to a system, which had it prevailed, I have no doubt would either have involved the Country in fresh & unsuspected scenes of distress--or terminated in the destruction of the Liberties of the States as established by Confederation, and I am persuaded by the convictions which already appear, similar attempts will not be soon made in Congress to infringe the rights of a Member of their body.(6) No Official intelligence is yet arrived of the Evacuation of Charles Town--but it seems now beyond a doubt to have taken Place. This is the only important news, and on which please to Accept my Congratulations. I have the honor to be with the greatest respect your Excellency's Very huml. servant, Jona Arnold  ""

  Dear Sir. Philadelphia Janry. 8. 1783.(1) Our old acquaintance will very well warrant the indulgence I allow myself of droping you a few Lines from this place, at the same time I wish it were more in my power than I find it is, to enlighten you on the great topick of peace, you no doubt see the Gazetts of this place, I understand Doctor Williamson sends them regularly to Edenton, these Sir contain as much intelligence as a member of Congress can communicate, at the same time an opinion may be ventured & I shall freely say to you tho I would not venture an opinion to the public, that I hope & much believe the present negotiations for peace will have a happy termination--from the facts you & the world know I reason thus. The Belligerent powers must have known before Commissions were exchanged the ultimate views of each party respectively--with respect to America she demands only her independence this also is the main object of the war on the part of France, it effects fully her Views of diminishing the over grown power of her natural enemy & Rival. As to Spain her Honour is satisfied in the Conquest of Minorca & the Dutch have so little zeal for war & so much for trade & Comerce that reasonable compensation or perhaps something less for the outrages Committed on the property of her Citizens will satisfie her; under this view of interests taking also into the accot. the humiliating concession of Britain already made, in granting a Comn. to Treat expressly with the 13 U. States, what less can be expected than the JANUARY 8, 1783  wished for peace--if G. Britain was not pretty sure, that the ultimate concessions in the course of the treaty wch. she had determined to make would ensure to her peace, would she be so weak As in effect to acknowledge American Independence? Would she not rather, at least affect to claim us as her subjects & keep this claim open for contingencies during the war? No doubt she would--have not the British Councils declared to the world the impracticability of recovering their lost Colonies & have they not now opened a treaty with them as sovereign & independt. states? Yes--wherefore then carry on the war, can we suppose that in her exausted condition, she is capable of futuring projects of conquest Agt. her other Enemies to make good what she has lost here: The Idea is too chimerical therefore on the whole, I conclude & give it as my chimney corner opinion that all parties are prepared for peace. Nothing I do assure you my Dear Sir is more true than that poor America is prepared for peace, indeed it may be said she is prepared for nothing else. In the early periods of the war Con-gress possessed powers very different from what they do now. They Could order the raising of Regiments, could organize armies & what is of particular consequence they held the purse strings of America, that is so long as paper could be found, they could find money--possessed fully of the Confidence of their Country they could turn even rags to Money. Midas like what e' re they touched they turned to gold, but alas! this gold has all turned to rags again & the art is lost lost, forever, see McFingal, & they are able now only to apply to their constituents for money, who are either not able or not willing to pay. Perhaps you will say, let them exercise their power of borrowing as other sovereigns do who enter into war, but I answer if they will borrow as other nations do, they must provide & appropriate ample Funds for paymt. of Interest & principal as other nations do. Promises wont do any longer & what funds I ask you have Congress in their power--none--they made one attempt to bring the states into a consent that they might Tax imports as far as 5 per Cent & after advocating the propriety nay necessity of the measure as a prop to Credt. for two years they have at length the mortification to find it wont go down. The little State of R. Island has had it in her power to blast the well grounded hopes that were conceived of such a measure & Virga. has since on this head gone retrograde. A deputation from the N. army is now before Congress stating their distresses & prophesying what will be the probable consequence if practising any longer on the patiance of the Soldiery. God grant us you will say a happy issue out of all our troubles; so we all say but this wont get the Cart out of the mire. The truth is Sir the fault is in the Constitution of Congress & if these distresses should happily point out a remedy in the right place and way, we shall by & by say as we have often had reason to say before, all is for the best, you will guess to what my hopes glance--things will soon be   better or worse. Our representation is now very full all the delegates being here, but as our Finances are not calculated but for the support of a bare representation Mr Blount & myself will go home soon.(2) The Doctor is satisfied to stay over his time wch. is very agreeable to me. Please to present my best respects to Mr. Johnston, yr. Lady &c. & believe me to be wth. the sincerest regard,  Dear Sir, yr. obt. Hble Servt. A. Nash ""

  Dear Sir (Private) Philada. Jany 9th. 1783. It is so long a time since I had the pleasure of a Line from you, that I Scarcely know whether you wish to hear from me however I shall Hazard a few Lines. Your last Letter was dated Octr. 5th. You will see by my Letter to the Honbl. the President what has been done respecting Contl. Money; as I think their is not any the least prospect of any thing being done to good purpose at present I Imagine the Delegates of Massachusetts will not move the Subject again very soon, and I Shall not unless I hear from the state on the Subject. I have seen the Resolve of the Genl. Court for Compleating their Battalions in Consequence of the Application of Genl. Washington.(1) This was a plan agreed on by him & the Secretary at War. It was altogether unknown by Congress (Except some Individual Members) untill about the 25th of December. I had been Informed of it by a Letter from the Army but not in time to write to the State previous to the November session, otherwise I Should have hazarded my Sentiments on that Subject in Contradiction to the Application. The Arangement of the 7th of August Ought to have taken place in the N.H. Line. Congress were Informed a few Days Since (about the 27th December) that application had been made, and that New Hamp. had agreed to raise their Troops, which was the principal Argument made use of for Suspending the Arangment which Resolution I Inclose you.(2) I am for General Arangements & requisitions I by no means wish to see the State of New Hampshire backward in Complying with the General Requisitions of Congress, But in this Case, I think in the first place that it is not probable we shall want more men, and in the Second if we did they ought to be raised from those States who are much more  JANUARY 9, 1783  delinquent than New Hampshire. The State of Pennsylvania have perhaps four times the Number of Inhabitants and as to Extent of Territory & wealth I cannot Say in what proportion they are to us but you can Judge, and you will see by this Resolution that, that State propose to Compleat Three Battalions to NHs. Two--but I need not add, your having recourse to the List of the Army which I Sent you some time Since (3) will shew you the numbers of Each States Troops. The State of Rhode Island (you are Undoubtedly informed) have Unanimously rejected the plan of an Impost, Virginia have repealed their Act, and at present I See no prospect of Congress having any Funds on which to Secure their Creditors. The Securities are many & they have been sold at great Discount, in this place. The Conduct of some States seems to be such as tho. they Expected each State would be Obliged to settle with their own Citizens. For my own part I hope the Confederation will be Strengthened and that we shall Continue United for a long time to Come, but if other States make Use of Such Policy, will it not be necessary for N.H. to do so too--perhaps I write too freely on this Subject, but when I hear some persons say our Accounts will not be adjusted (between each State) and the Arguments of others on the Subject of Continental Currency I think it my Duty to mention the matter. The Subject of obtaining the Value of Lands and Buildings in Each State to Ascertain the proportion of public Expences agreable to Confederation has been taken up, a Report is now under Consideration for Carrying that Article into Effect.(4) It seems to be a general Opinion that the Value cannot be Ascertained with any degree of Accuracy--if it could, would it be Equal? It is said (from the Circumstances of the War) that if it would have been Equal when Confederation was proposed it would now be very Unequal; my Own Opinion is that it never was nor will be Equal unless some other Tax (such as an Impost) or others which might be devised should go along with it--if we find so great difficulty in Ascertaining the proportion of Each Town & Parish, what may we Expect between State & State? My Opinion is that the Quota of each State will not be Determined agreeable to the Mode of Confederation and that unless the States can be Induced to grant some kind of Taxes as Imposts &c. that each One will have to pay the debts due to their own Citizens & how our foreign debt will be paid I cannot Say. But Enough on this Subject, perhaps my fears have out run my reason. We are Daily Expecting some further accounts from our Commissrs. in Europe by which we shall be able better to determine whether we may Expect Peace soon or not, for my Own part I cannot but hope we shall have Peace before the time for Opening another Campaign, but the Instability of our Enemy's Councils are such that we cannot depend on it untill we know the Articles are Signed.  Hope the State have Appointed Delegates to relieve us the beginning of April. Nothing further done respecting Vermont & please to make my Compliments to my Friends with You. I am, Your most Hum Servt. John Taylor Gilman P.S. Mr. Jefferson of Virginia who was Appointed one of our Commissrs. for making Peace is Just Setting out for Europe. ""

It appears that about One half part of the whole Money Emitted by Congress have been paid into the Treasury's or is now in the hands of Individuals in those Three States; The State of Massachusetts have made repeated Representations to Congress on this Subject, what measures they will take next I cannot Say; but I think their is not a prospect of any thing being done in Congress at present that will give Satisfaction to those States who hold more than their proportion of the Money.

11445,dg019420,1783,James Madison s Notes of Debates,"""James Madison's Notes of Debates
  Thursday Jany 9th & Friday Jany 10 [1783].(1) On the report (2) for valuing the land conformably to the rule laid down in the foederal articles, the delegates from Connecticut contended for postponing the subject during the war, alledging the impediments arising from the possession of N.Y. &c. by the enemy; but apprehending (as was supposed) that the flourishing state of Connecticut compared with the Southern States, would render a valuation at this crisis unfavorable to the former. Others particularly Mr. H[amilton] & Mr. [Madison] were of opinion that the rule of the confederation was a chimerical one, since if the intervention of the individual states were employed their interests would give a biass to their judgments or that at least suspicions of such biass wd prevail; and without their intervention, it could not be executed but at an expence, delay & uncertainty which were inadmissable; that it would perhaps be therefore preferable to represent these difficulties to the States & recommend an exchange of this rule of dividing the public burdens for one more simple, easy & equal. The Delegates from S. Carolina generally & particularly Mr. R____dge advocated the propriety of the constitutional rule & of an adherence to it, and of the safety of the mode in question arising from the honor of the State. The debates on the subject were interrupted by a letter from the Superintendant of Finance: informing Congress that the situation of his department required that a committee sd. be appointed with power to advise him on the steps proper to be taken; and suggesting an appointmt. of one consisting of a member from each State, with authority to give their advice on the subject.(3) This expedient was objected to as improper, since Congress wd. thereby delegate an incommunicable power, perhaps, and would at any rate lend a sanction to a measure without even knowing what it was; not to mention the distrust which it manifested of their own prudence & fidelity. It was at length proposed & agreed to, that a special committee consis- JANUARY 9, 1783  ting of Mr. Rutlidge, Mr. Osgood, & Mr. [Madison] should confer with the Superintendt of Finance on the subject of his letter and make report to Congress. After the adjournment of Congress this Committee conferred with the Superintendt who after being apprized of the difficulties which had arisen in Congress, stated to them that the last acct. of our money affairs in Europe shewed that contrary to his expectation and estimates there was 3½ Million of livres short of the bills actually drawn, that further draughts were indispensable to prevent a stop to the public service; that to make good this deficiency there was only the further success of Mr. Adams' loan, and the friendship of France to depend on, that it was necessary for him to decide on the expediency of his staking the public credit on these contingent funds by further draughts, and that in making this decision he wished for the sanction of a Committee of Congress; that this sanction was preferable to that of Congress itself only as it wd. confide the risk attending bills drawn on such funds to a smaller number, and as secrecy was essential in the operation as well to guard our affairs in general from injury, as the credit of the bills in question from debasement. It was supposed both by the Superntendt & the Committee that there was in fact little danger of bills drawn on France on the credit of the loan of 4 Million of dollars, applied for, being dishonored; since if the negociations on foot were to terminate in peace, France would prefer an advance in our favor to exposing us to the necessity of resorting to G. B. for it; and that if the war sd. continue the necessity of such an aid to its prosecution would prevail. The result was that the Committee should make such report as would bring the matter before Congress under an injunction of secrecy, and produce a resolution authorising the Superintdt. to draw bills as the public service might require on the credit of applications for loans in Europe. The report the next day of the Committee to this effect was accordingly made & adopted unanimously.4 Mr. Dyer alone at first opposed it, as an unwarrantable & dishonorable presumption on the ability & disposition of France; Being answered however that without such a step, or some other expedt. which neither he nor any other had suggested, our credit would be stabbed abroad and the public service wrecked at home; and that however mortifying it might be to commit our credit, our faith & our honor to the mercy of a foreign nation, it was a mortification wch. cd. not be avoided without endangering our very existence; he acquiesced and the resol. was entered unanimously. The circumstance of unanimity was thought of consequence, as it wd. evince the more the necessity of the succor and induce France the more readily to yield it. On this occasion several members were struck with the impropriety of the late attempt to withdraw from France the trust confided to her over the terms of peace when we were under the necessity of giving so decisive a proof of our dependance upon her. It   was also adverted to in private conversation as a great unhappiness that during negociations for peace, when an appearance of vigor & resource were so desirable, such a proof of our poverty & imbecility could not be avoided.(5) The conduct of Mr. Howel &c. had led several & particularly Mr. Peters into an opinion that some further rule & security ought to be provided for concealing matters of a secret nature. On the motion of Mr. Peters a committee composed of himself Mr. Williamson &c. was appointed to make report on the subject.(6) On this day the report was made. It proposed that members of Congress should each subscribe an instrument pledging their faith & honor not to disclose certain enumerated matters. The enumeration being very indistinct and objectionable, and a written engagement being held insufficient with those who without it wd. violate prudence or honor, as well as marking a general distrust of the prudence & honor of Congress, the report was generally disrelished; and after some debate in which it was fully (7) supported by Mr. Williamson, the committee asked & obtained leave to withdraw it. A discussion of the report on the mode of valuing the lands was revived. It consisted chiefly of a repetition of the former debates. In the evening according to appt. on Teusday last, the grand Committee met, as did the Superintendt. The chairman Mr. Wolcot informed the committee that Cols. Ogden & Brooks two of the deputies from the army had given him notice that Genl. McDougal the first of the deputation was so indisposed with a rheumatism as to be unable to attend, and expressed a desire that the Committee would adjourn to his lodging at the Indian queen tavern the deputies being very anxious to finish their business, among other reasons, on acct. of the scarcity of money with them. At first the Committee seemed disposed to comply; but it being suggested that such an adjournmt. by a Committee of a member from each State, would be derogatory from the respect due to themselves, especially as the Mission from the army was not within the ordinary course of duty, the idea was dropped. In lieu of it they adjourned to Monday evening next, on the ostensible reasons of the extreme badness of the weather which had prevented the attendance of several members. ""

  Sir Philadelphia Janry 9th 1783 I have not been favoured with a line from you, I want to hear how Publick affairs go on in New Hampshire, (the Eastward mail did not come in this week). We have no official account of the Evacuation of Charleston, but have no reason to doubt of the truth of it as published in the inclosed Newspaper. The affair of Continantal Bills now remaining in the hands of individuals &c was debated yesterday in Congress.(1) It was put to vote to sink them at 40 for one, and at 75, both negatived, the members from those States that have more than their Quota did not wish to have it tried at a lower rate, some of the Southward members mentioned a much lower rate, there were more that voted for 40 than for 75, it was on the principle of policy, that rate being what it was set at March 18, 1780. I perceive that the State of New Hampshire have been trying to raise more men for the Army which I am sorry for, as they have already more in the army than their proportion with most of the other States, and as Congress is at a loss to know what measures to take to Quiet the minds of those already on Duty, not only of New Hampshire line but of all the others. There is a Committee here from the Northern Army who have presented a memorial &c to Congress, of their grieveances, both officers & soldiers are uneasy for want of present pay, & of the uncertenty of future pay, the Officers of half pay in particular. Mr. Morris informed me that he had appointed Mr Stephen Gorham of Boston Commissioner on Continantal Accounts for the State of New Hampshire.(2) Doubtless there will be no objection to the appointment, he is a person of Integrity & ability has been employed in Committee for three years past on Continantal & other Publick accounts.

  Dear Sir, or believe I may say Friend,Philadelphia Jany. [10?](1) 1783. I wish I could write to you as free as I think, but I cannot, it is not prudent; God in his goodness has brot us to the beginning of a New Year. What Events this will bring forth God only knows. If His goodness was not and did not Extend far beyond our National deservings we should have no good to hope for or Expect. When we had sometime agoe the fairest prospects of Peace, how soon was our expectations blasted by a small incident even the death of one poor Mortal (the Marquis of Rockingham); a Strong Prospect again revived, Antecedent to the Providential Defeat at Gibralter. What Effect that will have is not yet known, but why do we wish for Peace? will that put an end to the Calamities of an unreformed People or may not even that we so Ardently wish for be Attended with greater Internal Calamities. Tho I long for Peace, Yet I most earnestly Deprecate what may follow, but let us hope for the Best as the goodness of God is not Limited to our Deserts. I wish my self at home, but the severe season forbids, but I again ask my self why do I wish for that, shall I find the world better there than here? I know not. Here, you are in the midst of Dissipation, unbounded Avarice, a City of Gambles; in Congress I dare not say, but Divided Councils, Exhausted Finances, no plan, System or practical method that promises relief. How Divided? Why to be plain, 2 or 3 States govern the whole & that Influence used much against N England and they, NE, have Cement, Unconnected, & Divided Among themselves, tho I wish I could say that Connecticut was not the Butt the Mark. I fear too much so, tho Rhodisland is the hated Object. An Established fund at least, and solely to be applied to the payment of Interest on our funded Debts, seemed the only practical relief of our Credit, but when I came to find that the Resolve of Congress did not appropriate it to the Intrest but to that or other Debts as they pleased, I will own I was not very sorry that Rhodisland (tho I believe rather with selfish Views) defeated the Plan, & Virginia have rescinded their Vote, so we are all aground, what shall be done no one knows. We have now Genll McDougal with 2 Colls as a Comtee from the Army full of Complaints, but principally for want of pay, & no money to pay them, our Credit nearly at an end, New England have not paid an 8th part of last years tax, the Jerseys & Pensylvania about in proportion, farther southward (except a little from Maryland) not a farthing, tho South Carolina Claim the Credit of supplying the Army that way. Charlestown is now totally Evacuated by the Enemy; and South Carolina & Georgia wholly relieved. I know but little what has been doing for about 2 months past in Congress, I suppose Mr. Wolcott and Mr. Ellsworth have wrote as they have been here for sometime, tho unknown to me till my return from Trenton I  JANUARY 10, 1783  Portrait of Eliphalet Dyer  found them here. York had again revived the affair of Vermont before I left Congress but could not prevail While I remained. Congress I percieve are Indeavouring to play the same game with them as Great Britain with America and believe after solemn plighted faith being Violated as they will call it right or wrong they are to expect no more Success. By a late Resolve threatning them with Authority & force if they do not Imediately restore the Persons & Estates of some dissaffected persons who had Undertaken to Undermine their Government and had taken offices under New York State to Execute their Laws on Vermont I believe will Nestle them. The last Declaration I made in Congress before I went to Trenton was to forewarn them against such measures as Vain, fruitless, ineffectual & which would only rebound with Contempt on their own heads; I did not think the measure would prevail, urged that the Motion from York might lye by till my return & for the New England States to be more fully represented, but as soon as gone York Influence carried every thing, & Congress will suffer the Contempt they have, against faithfull Warning brot on themselves. A principle matter which Governs against Acknowledging Vermont an Independent State (after a most solemn Engagement) is the Strength, weight & Influence it may in future give the New England States in Congress, Yet it seems no policy will influence New England; which brings me to the Unhappy Issue of our Late Tryal with Pensylvania, (2) Chargrind and dissapointed, I know you will say why did not we get the Cause postponed. We Indeavoured to the utmost of our power in Congress but in vain; we were there forced to proceed, we then had to agree upon our Judges. As I could not trust Congress in any one step thot it best to agree, & when we had agreed & as I thot a good Choice they found means to Induce one on whom we had great dependence Viz the late Govr Rutledge a Gentn of skill, ability & Integrity to refuse. That frustrated my plan much, but for reasons I can give you Verbatim, it was forced, and as we had finally agreed on 3 from Virginia, 2 from New England, Houston from the Jerseys, I will own I thot we were safe, but so Providence ordered the 2 from Virginia, one of which a learned Judge Jones, failed of attending, by means of which I believe Eventually we lost our Cause;(3) a Cause of Magnitude indeed, & which on every legal ground & principle, as well as policy to the United States in General, the New England in particular ought to have been given in favor of Connecticut but Unhapily New England Judges I believe were most against us. They have merely given their opinion in short vs. Connecticut without reason or principle Assignd, & in one thing I will own they were wise, that is they agreed they would not ever give to the parties or any other person the reason or principle on which they founded their Judgement, for if they did I am sure every sensible Impartial man must Condemn them, but if we may Conjecture there is no doubt with me that they left every Legal solid   ground and took up the long Silence of Connecticut, the contest in Connecticut against the Claim, Govr Fitches letter calling of it a wild scheem in our people, & the cautious manner in which our assembly first treated the affair, and such kind of extraneous matter, with a little pleasure in dissapointing Connecticut in some, Winged away the cause against us; the Cause by Doctr Johnson & Coll Root was placed in every advantageous point of Light, they were Intent upon it for more than 40 days, they never exerted themselves better nor to more advantage. I cast in my mite, we were in no measure out done in Council or in the management of the Cause, by the Voice of the Judges or by slanders, but our cause is lost & I fear no remedy, tho the setlers by Confederation have still a right of Tryal & not (by the opinion of the Judges) to be affected by this as they would not Continue or delay the Cause to have them Cited and for that reason I am extreemly Anxious for them & Pity them with all my heart & wish their relief. I am promised a Copy of the Trial & Sentence &c this Evening which I mean to send to the Govr by Brown who sets off tomorrow morning. By the Way Congress have not accepted the Cession of Connecticut made of their Western Lands & tho they accepted New York, yet they would not Connecticut for fear it might have some influence in our favor on the Trial. Fail not to have that Cession revoked for yet beyond Pensylvania on the borders of Lake Erie &c we have the best tract of Country in America. At least leave a large tract of Country there for the benefit of the State, & only Cede that beyond as New York have done to what they have no Title. Use this letter with Caution, it is wrote in hast, I wish some was left out. Remember me to my friends & particular Acquaintance & believe me most Sincerely Yours, Elipht Dyer [P.S.] The reason I have not wrote to the Assembly is because Doctr Johnson & Coll Root two of their Agents have returnd home & will make any report of the Cause Needful.

  Sir, Philda. [January 12] 1783 I am honored with your excellency's letter of the 29th Decr. I have received an order from Col. Hay on Mr. Sands, which I have no doubt will shortly be paid. I have felt no inconvenience from not having the money sooner. Since my last to you,(1) we have received no further accounts from Europe, so that we remain in the same uncertainty with respect to the negotiations for peace. Wether it will take place or not, is a problem of difficult solution. The duplicity and unsteadiness for which Lord Shelburne is remarkable will not justify any confidence in his intentions; and the variety of interests to be conciliated in a treaty of peace, with the best intentions on all sides must render it a work of difficulty. I suspect, too, the Spaniards and Dutch will have large demands. We have now here a deputation from the army, and feel a mortification of a total disability to comply with their just expectations. If, however, the matter is taken up in a proper manner, I think their application may be turned to a good account. Every day proves more & more the insufficiency of the confederation. The proselytes to this opinion are increasing fast, and many of the most sensible men acknowledge the wisdom of the measure recommended by your legislature at their last sitting.(2) Various circumstances conspire at this time to incline to the adoption of it, and I am not without hope it may ere long take place. But I am far from being sanguine. JANUARY 12 1783  We are deliberating on some mode for carrying that article of the confederation into execution, which respects the valuation of lands to ascertain the quotas of the several states. None has yet been proposed, that appears to me eligible. I confess I dislike the principle altogether, but we are tied down by the Confederation. The affairs of the grants have been no further touched since the resolutions transmitted to you.(3) It is a business in which nobody cares to act with decision. As intimated before, I must doubt the perseverance of Congress, if military coercion should become necessary. I am clear the only chance the legislature have for recovering any part of the revolted territory is by a compromise with N. Hampshire, and this compromise must originate between the states themselves. I hope the legislature will revise the late act for confirming the possessions of those who hold lands in that country. I am certain there are doubts upon the subject, and it were much to be wished such doubts did not exist. The present dissatisfaction of the army is much opposed to any experiment of force in a service where scruples of interest or prejudice may operate. I am, &c. A.

  Monday Jany. 13 [1783]. Report on the valuation of land was referred to a G. Committee.(1) A motion was made by Mr. Peters 2ded by Mr. [Madison] \""that a committee be appointed to consider the expediency of making further applications for loans in Europe, & to confer with the Superintdt. of Finance on the subject.\"" In support of this motion Mr. P. observed that notwithstanding the uncertainty of success the risk of appearing unreasonable in our demands on France, and the general objections agst. indebting the U. S. to foreign nations, the crisis of our affairs demanded the experiment; that money must if possible be procured for the army and there was ground to expect that the Ct. of France wd. be influenced by an apprehension that in case of her failure & of a pacification, G. B. might embrace the opportunity of substituting her favours.(2) Mr. [Madison] added that it was expedient to make the trial because if it failed our situation cd. not be made worse, that it would be prudent in France & therefore it might be expected of her, to afford the U. S. such supplies as would enable them to disband  JANUARY 13, 1783  their army in tranquility, lest some internal convulsions might follow external peace, the issue of which ought not to be hazarded, that as the affections & gratitude of this Country as well as its separation from G. B. were her objects in the Revolution, it would also be incumbent on her to let the army be disbanded under the impression of deriving their rewards through her friendship to their Country; since their temper on their dispersion through the several States and being mingled in the public councils, would very much affect the general temper towards France, and that if the pay of the army could be converted into a consolidated debt bearing interest, the requisitions on the States for the principal might be reduced to requisitions for the interest, and by that means a favorable revolution so far introduced into our finances. The Motion was opposed by Mr. Dyer because it was improper to augment our foreign debts, & would appear exuavagant to F. Several others assented to it with reluctance, and several others expressed serious scruples as honest men agst. levying contributions on the friendship, or jealousy of France or others, whilst the unwillingness of the States to invest Congress with permanent funds rendered a repayment so precarious. The motion was agreed to, and the Committee chosen Mr. Ghoram, Mr. Peters, Mr. Izzard. In the evening according to appointment the G. Committee gave an audience to the deputies from the army, viz Genl. McDougal & Cols. Ogden & Brooks. The first introduced the subject by acknowledging the attention manifested to the representations of the army by the appt. of so large a committee. His observations turned chiefly on the 3 cheif topics of the memorial, namely an immediate advance of pay, adequate provision for the residue, and half pay. On the first he insisted on the absolute necessity of the measure to soothe the discontents both of the officers & Soldiers, painted their sufferings & services, their successive hopes & disappointments throughout the whole war, in very high coloured expressions, and signified that if a disappointment were now repeated the most serious consequences were to be apprehended; that nothing less than the actual distresses of the army would have induced at this crisis so solemn an application to their country, but that the seeming approach of peace, and the fear of being still more neglected when the necessity of their services should be over, strongly urged the necessity of it. His two colleagues followed him with a recital of various incidents & circumstances tending to evince the actual distresses of the army, the irritable state in which the deputies left them and, the necessity of the consoling influence of an immediate advance of pay. Col. Ogden said he wished not indeed to return to the army if he was to be the messenger of disappointment to them. The deputies were asked 1st what particular steps they supposed would be taken by the army in case no pay cd. be immediately   advanced; to which they answered that it was impossible to say precisely, that altho' the Sergeants & some of the most intelligent privates had been often observed in sequestered consultations, yet it was not known that any premeditated plan had been formed; that there was sufficient reason to dread that at least a mutiny would ensue, and the rather as the temper of the officers, at least those of inferior grades, would with less vigor than heretofore, struggle agst. it. They remarked on this occasion, that the situation of the officers was rendered extremely delicate & had been sorely felt, when called upon to punish in Soldiers a breach of engagements to the public which had been preceeded by uniform & flagrant breach by the latter of its engagements to the former. General McDougal said that the army were verging to that state which we are told will make a wise man mad, and Col. B. said that his apprehensions were drawn from the circumstance that the temper of the army was such that they did [not] (3) reason or deliberate cooly on consequences, & therefore a disappointment might throw them blindly into extremities. They observed that the irritations of the army had resulted in part from the distinctions made between the Civil & military lists, the former regularly receiving their salaries, and the latter as regularly left unpaid. They mentioned in particular that the members of the Legislatures would never agree to an adjournment with[out] paying themselves fully for their services. In answer to this remark it was observed that the Civil officers on the average did not derive from their appointments more than the means of their subsistance; and that the military altho not furnished with their pay properly so called were in fact furnished with the same necessaries. On the 2d point to wit \""adequate provision for the general arrears due to them,\"" the deputies animadverted with surprize and even indignation on the repugnance of the States, some of them at least, to establish a foederal revenue for discharging the foederal engagements. They supposed that the ease not to say affluence with wch. the people at large lived sufficiently indicated resources far beyond the actual exertions, and that if a proper application of these resources was omitted by the Country & the army thereby exposed to unnecessary sufferings, it must naturally be expected that the patience of the latter wd. have its limits. As the deputies were sensible that the general disposition of Congress strongly favoured this object, they were less diffuse on it. Genl. McDougal made a remark wch. may deserve the greater attention as he stepped from the tenor of his discourse to introduce it, and delivered it with peculiar emphasis. He said that the most intelligent & considerate part of the army were deeply affected at the debility and defects in the federal Govt. and the unwillingness of the States to cement & invigorate it; as in case of its dissolution, the benefits expected from the Revolution wd. be greatly impaired, and as in particular, the contests which might ensue amg. the States would be sure to embroil the officers which respectively belonged to them. JANUARY 14, 1783  On the 3d point to wit \""half pay for life\"" they expressed equal dissatisfaction at the States which opposed it, observing that it formed a part of the wages stipulated to them by Congress & was but a reasonable provision for the remnant of those lives which had been freely exposed in the defence of their country, and would be incompatible with a return to occupations & professions for which military habits of 7 years standing unfitted them. They complained that this part of their reward had been industriously and artfully stigmatized in many states with the name of pension, altho' it was as reasonable that those who had lent their blood and services to the public sd. receive an annuity thereon, as those who had lent their money; and that the officers whom new arrangements had from time to time excluded, actually laboured under the opprobrium of pensioners, with the additional mortification of not receiving a shilling of the emolumts. They referred however to their Memorial to shew--that they were authorised & ready to commute their half pay for any equivalent & less exceptionable provision. After the departure of the deputies, the Grand Committee appointed a subcommittee consisting of Mr. Hamilton, Mr. Madison & Mr. Rutlidge to report arrangements in concert with the Superintendt. of Finance for their consideration.(4) ""

11450,dg019425,1783,James Madison s Notes of Debates,"""James Madison's Notes of Debates
  Teusday Jany. 15th [i.e., 14] 1783. Congress adjourned for the meeting of the Grand Committee to whom was referred the report concerning the valuation of the lands, and who accordingly met.(1) The Committee were in general strongly impressed with the extreme difficulty & inequality if not impracticability of fulfilling the article of Confederation relative to this point; Mr. Rutlidge however excepted, who altho' he did not think the rule so good a one as a census of inhabitants, thought it less impracticable than the other members. And if the valuation of lands had not been prescribed by the fOEderal articles, the Committee wd. certainly have preferred some other rule of apportionment, particularly that of numbers under certain qualifications as to Slaves. As the foederal Constitution however  JANUARY 14, 1783  left no option, & a few (2) only were disposed to recommend to the States an alteration of it, it was necessary to proceed 1st. to settle its meaning--2dly. to settle the least objectionable mode of valuation. On the first point, it was doubted by several members wher. the returns which the report under consideration required from the States would not be final and whether the Arts. of Confn. wd. allow Congress to alter them after they had fixed on this mode; on this point no vote was taken. A 2d question afterwards raised in the course of the discussion was how far the Art. required a specific valuation, and how far it gave a latitude as to the mode. On this point also there was a diversity of opinions, but no vote taken. 2dly. As to the mode itself referred to the Gd. Committee, it was strongly objected to by the Delegate from Cont. Mr. Dyer, by Mr. Hamilton, by Mr. Wilson, Mr. Caroll & Mr. M[adison], as leaving the States too much to the biass of interest, as well as too uncertain & tedious in the execution. In favr. of the Rept. was Mr. Rutlidge the father of it, who thought the honor of the States & their mutual confidence a sufficient security agst. frauds & the suspicion of them. Mr. Ghoram favd. the report also, as the least impracticable mode, and as it was necessary to attempt at least some compliance with the foederal rule before any attempt could be properly made to vary it. An opinion intertained by Massachusts that she was comparatively in advance to the U. S. made her anxious for a speedy settlement of the mode by which a final apportionment of the common burden cd. be effected. The sentiments of the other members of the Committee were not expressed. Mr. Hamilton proposed in lieu of a referrence of the valuation to the States, to class the lands throughout the States under distinctive descriptions, viz arable, pasture, wood &c. and to annex a uniform rate to the several classes according [to] their different comparative values calling on the States only for a return of the quantities & descriptions. This mode would have been acceptable to the more compact & populous States, but was totally inadmissible to the Southern States. Mr. Wilson proposed that returns of the quantity of land & of the number of inhabitants in the respective States sd. be obtain'd, and a rule deduced from the combination of these data. This also would have affected the States in a similar manner with the proposition of Mr. H. On the part of the So. States it was observed that besides its being at variance with the text of the Confederation it would work great injustice, as would every mode which admitted the quantity of lands within the States, into the measure of their comparative wealth & abilities. Lastly it was proposed by Mr [Madison] that a valuation sd. be attempted by Congress without the intervention of the States. He   observed that as the expence attending the operation would come ultimately from the same pockets, it was not very material whether it was borne in the first instance by Congress or the States, and that it at least deserved consideration whether this mode was not preferable to the proposed reference to the States. This conversation ended in the appt. of a Subcommittee consisting of Mr. M[adison], Mr. Caroll & Mr. Wilson who were desired to consider the several modes proposed, to confer with the Superintendt. of Finance, & make such report to the Gd. Come. as they sd. judge fit.(3) ""

All the foreign articles which have come to hand are published in the inclosed gazette of this morning. The evacuation of Charleston is at length reduced to certainty by the publications in the N.

The explanations which they have given to a Committee on the topics of the Memorial are of the most serious nature. I wish they could with propriety be promulged throughout the U.S. They would I am sure, at least put to shame all those who have laboured to throw a fallacious gloss over our public affairs, and counteracted the measures necessary to the real prosperity of them. The deliberations of Congress have been turned pretty much of late on the valuation of lands prescribed by the articles of confederation. The difficulties which attend that rule of apportionment seem on near inspection to be in a manner insuperable. The work is too vast to be executed without the intervention of the several States, and if their intervention be employed, all confidence in an impartial execution is at end. I have not been able to find sufficient leisure for taking the copies which you asked & which I promised. I am the less uneasy at the delay as the conveyance by the post is rendered so precarious by the weather. JANUARY 14, 1783  Docr.

It was in the next place referred to a come. in order that some complimentary report might be made in favor of Genl. Greene & the Southn. army. Docr. Ramsay havg come in after this reference and being uninformed of it, moved that a Committee might be appointed to devise a proper mode of expressing to Genl. Green the high sense entertained by Congress of his merits & services. In support of his motion he went into lavish praises of Gl. Greene, and threw out the idea of making him a Lieutent. General. His motion being opposed as somewhat singular and unnecessary after the reference of Gl. Greene's letter, he withdrew it.(3) A letter was rcd. from Genl.

  Sir. Philadelpa. 15th Janry. 1783 I have this instant recd. your Favour of the 30th ultimo, and am glad to be informed by it that you have obtained one principal object  JANUARY 15, 1783  which you had in Veiw in makeing your Journey to Litchfield. Mr Ellsworth says that you will succeed in the Business which you propose. I am Very glad that he has a good Opinion of you, as there is no one whose Freindship would be more Serviceable to you; And as he is a Gentleman of great candor and Integrity, as well as in high Reputation in his Profession, you will I doubt not Merit that Regard from him, which I beleive he is inclined to bestow. I will enquire what Law Books may be purchased in this Town, at present they are doubless Very dear, and probably Scarce. If a Peace shall soon take place (of which at present no certain Opinion can be formed) Books will fall exceedingly. I think that it may be well for you to Send me a List of Such as you would Wish to get, as I shall then be able to give you a more Satisfactory answer than I can at present. I thot that Mr. Goodwin had regularly recd. all the weekly news Publications of this City, but as it seems he does not I shall Attend to the Object of his Wishes, and shall See how yours Shall be also gratified. I am Satisfied with Regard to your Conduct respecting your Administration. I know that the Goverment will Accept their own Notes, now due in Discharge of Mr Sheldon's Debt, and therefore you may do well to comply with his offer. You must get money from some of these People to defrey Expences. Perhaps he may consent to advance a small Ballance on this Account. With Regard to the Town Matters of Litchfield I am not much Surprized at them, They will run more and more in that Channel as long as the two Priests of that Town hold their Offices. The one will get what I have been long convinced the other would be perpetually losing. If (besides other Considerations it shall be the road of Ambition) the Declension will be much Accelerated. I expect that I shall be able to Send you Genl. Green's Letter respecting the Evacuation of Charlestown as it is about to be published.(1) It is Said that the enemy carried off about seven Thousand Negroes. Those Fellows destind to be wretched will receive no Benefit by their change of Masters. There has been a general Exchange of all our People in Captivity or under Parole including Militia Men and Citizens taken by the Enemy's Southern Army. We have no News Very Material from Europe but what you will find in the Papers. We must therefore wait to know wheather G Britain Seriously means to prosecute her Negotiation for the Reestablishment of Peace. The Merchants here are in Anxious Suspense--the shopkeepers do not at present incline to Purchase. A Lye was started a few days ago that the English ministers had by an order of the French Court left Paris, this Story of about Six Hours continuance effected the Sale of Several Thousands of Weights of Sugar besides other merchandise, But it probably cannot be repeated with equal Success.  The great State of R Island has put her Veto upon a Measure judged Necessary by every other State and wheather any other Persuasives than such as were wont to be made use of by polish Electors will convince them of their error I am not able to Say. Virginia it is Said has repealed her Act Vesting a Power in the U States to collect the Imports. How We are to Support our foreign Credit without establishing a certain Revenue I am not Able to conceive, if Something more effectual shall not be done, to support National Credit, We have Reason to fear Consequences the most destressing. The money collected by the States is Very inconsiderable, and no certain advise has been recd. that one or Two of them has collected any for the Service 1782. A Committee of the Army are attending Congress for Pay, and for a more effectual Security for the Emoluments which the Acts of Congress intituled them to Their Application is gone to a Committee who have not yet reported. It is in Contemplation to order a Valuation of the Lands and Houses of the respective States agreably to the Articles of Confederation, which perhaps will be adopted, but I fear that the Dificulty of carrying such a Measure into Execution will only discover its insufficiency.(2) And unless some other Principle shall be adopted more certain and definite upon which the pecuniary Assessments shall be made I shall not Apprehend that any Thing material will be done. But however we must Attempt to proceed upon such Principles as are agreed to, till others can be established, I hope that some Proposals will be made to the States to adopt more adequate Principles. The Legislature of this State have met this day. I have thot it my Duty to make all the Interest in my Power that this State shall quiet the Susquehannah settlers.(3) I think that they will do it, and I hope liberally. I have spoken to Sundry influencing Gentlemen upon the Subject who seem to be well inclinded, And very frankly declare that they will do all in their Power to Satisfy and establish the Settlers in their Possessions. If this shall be effected which I have but little doubt of, it will prevent a Number of innocent People from suffering that Distress, which they ought to have been secured against by a Stipulation previous to the Tryal of the Cause. By the Blessing of God I injoy Health. I have already wrote you two hasty Letters. You will frequently write to me. I shall wish to know wheither Frederick is at the College, and how he behaves himself. You will present my Compliments to Mr Lyman and Mr. Mosely--and if they will Favour me with their Letters I will duly Acknowledge them. May the divine Being guide, protect and Bless you. Yours with the kindest Regard, Oliver Wolcott P.S. I wish that you would let me know wheather in your Opinion the Sept. 2d Tax is so collected that the Treasr could discharge a Draft upon him of perhaps one hundred or one hundred and fifty pounds   upon my Application. Upon farthar tho' t I will take yr. Advice and write to the Treasr upon the Subject; And obtain his Answer.(4) ""

  My dear Sir, Philadelphia Jany 16th 1783 I have but a Moment or two to acknowledge the rect. of your Favour of the 12th Instt. Yesterday we recd the Official Acct. of the Evacuation of Charles Town. Genl. Greene entered it on the 14th Ultimo. In the Papers enclosed you have Extracts from his Letter. The Enemy carried off 5000 Troops, which far exceeded our Ideas of their Strength. Genl Greene lay within 13 Miles of them, tho his Army did not consist in the whole of every denomination of more than 2000 Men. They took off about 7000 Negroes, which they had plundered from the Inhabitants. I am sensible that the difficulties you mention as attendant on your Office, will & must ensue--but I am Confidant you have gone too far to recede, and that you will not give Satisfaction, unless you make the Experiment and let your Objections be the result of Experience. As to the Arrangement of Vouchers, tho' this may be necessary, yet you may proceed on others that are ready for settlement. Indeed I think you should receive in all applications & then fix days for final Settlement--which will save great Trouble in attendance. Mr Morris has no authority to settle Prices, & Congress can never descend to the minutia of detail. I have paid Mr Robertson 95 Dollars more on Acct. as on my last & belonging to the same Person The Card Racks, are the same identical Things you refer to, made of tin, Japanned, about 14 Inches long, with a Memorandum of the Days of the week, as some People are very apt to forget them in the hurry of Business--to prevent which they are tolerable good Contrivances. You undoubtedly fixed on the best pair of Branches as I know your Judgment is so good, that you could not be mistaken especially as there is but that one pair in the House. Those purchased of Mr. H____ being here already. As to the Logs I meant that some should be cut as well as haled, which Mr. Southerd said he could do in the hard weather. As it is a matter of so much Importance that you should know with Certainty whether a Peace will take Place; or not, in order to ascertain the quantity of wood necessary to be cut, I would advise you for the Present by way of diversion, to get not more than 20 Cords and I will let you know positively by the Middle of May, whether we shall have Peace next Spring or not. I have recd another Pacquet from Marsden, the Communciation is encreased via St. Thomas's, Teneriffe, Grenada &c. I obtained the Bills from Sammy amounting to £129.10.

It is said that they Carried of between 6 and 7,000 Negroes at the time they left it. No late accounts Respecting the Negociations for peace; tho from General Appearances, my hope and Expectation is, that it will take place, tho Intelligence that we may Receive within three Weeks will probably Satisfie us on that head.

Some time past I was Induced to think, this business would have been settled Speedily, but that prospect has almost Vanished, it has been repeatedly debated and might now be taken up again if their was any prospect of any thing being done towards a Conclusion of it. You mention the Subject of Depreciation &c., I have no Copy of my Letter to you of the 9th Instt. but think I Mentioned, that a Commtee. of Officers from the Army was here; the Subject of those Settlements, Half-Pay &c. is now under Consideration. As to the Frigate you Mention, she run on Shore in a Storm, Cut away her Masts &c. (which were lost) but is got off, & now here. Yesterday Dispatches were received from Genl. Greene respecting the Evacuation of Charlestown, the Enemy left it very Quietly in Consequence of an Agreement that they should not be Molested on their Retiring; the Southern States are Once more freed from the Enemy, I wish they would be so wise as to Quit New-York & Penobscot immediately, they have Traversed our Country, (almost every part of it) but their present possessions are small. JANUARY 16, 1783  As to a General Peace I have wrote my Sentiments per Genl. Whipple and it is Unnecessary to repeat them. Genl. Whipple spent several Days here, (3) I conversed with him very freely on the Subject of Vermont & several other matters. He informed me, that if the next meeting of the Assembly should be at Exeter, that he would go there for the purpose of giving such information as he had obtained here respecting our affairs and to him I must beg leave to refer you. Have now under Consideration a Mode for Ascertaining the Quotas of each State agreeably to the articles of Confederation. Our Letter of the 11th Ultimo (4) mentioned our desire that Delegates might be Appointed to relieve us the beginning of April, if am not Informed whether any Appointments have been made, if not hope it will be done early next session which (by your Letter) appears probable will be in February tho. I am not Informed to what time the Assembly did adjourn--another part of that Letter was on the Supply of Money which hope will be seasonably provided. By the Paper I see their is a very great proportion of New Members in the Assembly wish it may prove to be for the Interest of the State. I wrote you a Letter on the 23d Octr. but have not been informed whether it reached you. What is done respecting the New Constitution? What is doing with the Confiscating Act?

  Thursday Jany. 16 [1783]. Mr. Rutlidge informed Congress that there was reason to apprehend that the train of negociations in Europe had been so mis-represented in the State of S. Carolina as to make it probable that an attempt might be made in the Legislature to repeal the confiscation laws of that State, & even if such attempt sd. fail, the misrepresentations cd. not fail to injure the sale of the property confiscated in that State. In order therefore to frustrate these misrepresentations he moved that the Delegates of S. Carolina might be furnished with an extract from the letter of the 14th of Ocr. from Docr. Franklin, so far as it informed Congress, \""that something had been mentioned to the American Plenipotentiaries relative to the Refugees & to English debts, but not insisted on: it being answered on their part that this was a matter belonging to the individual States and on which Congress cd. enter into no Stipulations.\""(1) The motion was 2ded by Mr. Jarvais & supported by Mr. Ramsay. It was opposed by Mr. Elseworth & Mr. Wolcott as improper, since a communication of this intelligence, might encourage the States to extend confiscations to British debts, a circumstance which wd. be dishonorable to the U. S. & might embarrass  JANUARY 16, 1783  a treaty of peace. Mr. Fitzimmons expressed the same apprehensions. So did Mr. Ghorum. His Colleague Mr. Osgood was in favr. of the motion. By Mr.[Madison] the motion was so enlarged and varied as \""to leave all the delegates at liberty to communicate the extract to their Constents. in such form & under such cautions as they sd. judge prudent.\"" The motion so varied was adopted by Mr. R. & substituted in place of the original one. It was however still opposed by the opponents of the original motion. Mr. M[adison] observed that as all the States had espoused in some degree the doctrine of confiscations, & as some of them had given instructions to their delegates on the subject, it was the duty of Congress without enquiring into the expediency of Confiscations, to prevent as far as they cd. any measures which might impede that object in negociations for peace, by inducing an opinion that the U. S. were not firm with respect to it; that in this view it was of consequence to prevent the repeal & even the attempt of a repeal of the confiscation law of one of the States, and that if a confidential communication of the extract in question would answer such a purpose, it was improper for Congress to oppose it. On a question the motion was negatived, Congress being much divided thereon. Several of those who were in the negative, were willing that the Delegates of S. Carolina sd. be licenced to transmit to their State what related to the Refugees, omitting what related to British debts and invited Mr. R. to renew his motion in that qualified form. Others suggested the propriety of his contradicting the misrepresations in general without referring to any official information recd. by Congress. Mr. R. said he wd. think further on the subject, and desired that it might lie over.(2) ""

I delivered the Letter to Dr. Rush who informs me that the intended purchesor has fallen to £1400--indeed I scarcely think you right in taking £1600--not but that it is more than it will ever bring hereafter; but it is so great a certainty, in Case of an Accident, either for you or Mrs. P. that I am loath you should let it go. The certainty of it's allways being in demand, and the regularity with which the rent is paid, makes it a very eligible Concern--Unless you would agree to vest the Purchase Money in Bank Shares, which would be still better. I am really afraid that some day or other the Capture of a Mail, will afford Rivington a merry Page or two in his Paper, to the no small Mortification of his ______ & her R. H____ as well as their Country Friends. We are greatly mortified at your & our disappointmt in your intended Jaunt.

I must beg the favour of your keeping her till I can consider farther of the Matter & try to dispose of the Mare. Mr. Wallace was to have the Choice of the Stackes, but he was to take the whole Stack at once, as I could not own the risque of the remainder spoiling after it was once broke--and I cannot have the Hay weighed after it gets home, as the waste in Carting is very great, but it must be estimated before it goes off. Do not let any more go unless you are sure of having enough & to spare for our selves--but send him to Rickey. I am in great Haste, with Love to all, Yours Affectly, B P.S.

A Committee of the Army are attending Congress and Applying for Pay, and Security for their future Emoluments, and if the whole of their Pay shall Not be made which they do not expect, that their Accounts may be liquidated, and Security given for the Ballance upon Substantial Funds. A Report of a Committee has been made upon this Subject, but Nothing has yet been done upon it. Congress have also a Committee to devise a Mode whereby to Value the House and Lands of respective States who have not yet reported. The present State of our Finances renders it improbable that any immediate Pay can be made to the Army, but I hope that before long something will be done for them. The State of Connecticut has for the Two last Months made as liberal Payment as any State According to their Quota. Some indeed are strangely deficient but I hope that our own Exertions will continue and am glad to be informed that some money has been lately sent to our Line. An unfortunate Affair or rather a disgraceful [one] has lately happened in Chester County in this State. A large Quantity of Cloathing  JANUARY 22, 1783  sent by Sir Guy Carlton under a Passport from Genl. Washington to our Prisoners at Lancaster has been Seized by some People in that County under an Idea that they are Contraband.(1) The Legislature of this State are now sitting. Congress by a Committee have represented to the Executive this Atrocious Violation of the Laws of Nations and the Principles of the Confederation. The Executive seem impressed with a Sence of the great Impropriety of this Conduct, but show a Law of the State which passed the last year which Appears to justify Such a Seisure. The Assembly Say that by their Constitution they cannot pass an ex Post Facto Act--in the mean Time I am told that Fresh Seisures are dayly making in Chester County of the Cloathing and which has been countenanced by People of popular Reputation in that County. People in Power here seem at present to imagin that nothing can be done but to perswade those Fellows to give up their Seisures. This Affair places us in a scandolous Situation. I hope that the State will See that the Cloathing is restored--but such is the Party Spirit of this People and the Weakness of their Government, that but little is to be expected from them. If the U States cannot by their Passports give Protection I think that no one ought to trust them. The settlers at Wyoming have presented a Petition to [. . .] (2) that they might be [. . .] (3) [noth]ing yet has been Done upon it. I have interested myself in behalf of those People all in my Power. Almost every Gentleman of Influence with whom I have conversed has assured me that he will do all in his Power that those People shall receive a Very liberal Treatment from the State, and such as will Satisfy them. I flatter myself that it will be done. It would give me much Regret that those who have settled under a publick Incourragment and have done and suffered so much should be molested in their Possessions. My best Regards to my Sister.

  Sir, Philadelpa. 22d Janry. 1783 I have been favoured with your Letter of the 12t instant. I will furnish the Pay table with a compleat Sett of the Journals of Congress by the first Oppertunity. Mr Smith recd. his Commission about Two  JANUARY 22, 1783  Months ago. Mr Morriss supposes him to be now at Hartford. Whenever I shall write any Letter to Hartford I shall inclose some News papers from which Mr Goodwin will be able to make such Abstracts as he pleases. This is all I can properly do for him and this will probably Answer his Purpose, as I shall write frequently. I recd. no Papers by the last Post, & unless they Shall be inclosed in white Paper as a common Letter, I know by Experience that I shall receive but few of them. You will inform me of all Material Matters transacted by the Assembly. I am glad to hear of the Efficacy of our Taxation. Few if any of the States furnishes so much according to our Quota, as We have done the Two last Months; some indeed are criminally remiss. Nothing has yet been done upon the Application of the Officers from the Army, a Report of a Committee has just been made. I wish our Ability to pay the Army was more considerable than it is. At present it is not in our Power to furnish them with any tho I hope something will be effected of this kind before long. I am glad that our State has Sent some Money to their Line. We may dayly [expect?] to get such Intelligence from Europe as will enable us to judge wheither We are to expect a speedy Peace or the Continuance of the War. Some Fellows in Chester County in this State, who Sustain a high popular Reputation, have seised a large Quantity of Cloathing sent by Sir Guy Carleton to our Prisoners at Lancaster under the Protection of a Passport from Genl Washington, upon an Idea that they are contraband.(1) This kind of seisure seems to be countenanced by a Law of this State. The Legislature here are now setting. They say that they cannot make any Ex Post Facto Law to give Relief, the Executive have neither Power nor Energy. The Supplys are detained in that County-- fresh Seisures I am told are dayly making, in Manifest Violation of the Laws of Nations, and to the indelible Reproach of the U. States. These Proceedings are clearly in Violation of the Articles of the Confederation, but are suffered to continue thro the Ignorance, Weakness and Party spirit, which are most conspicuous in this State. If this Evil shall not be speedily redressed which every sensible Man here, and many of their insensible ones of which they have great Numbers, seem convinced is Necessary to be done, I hope that Congress will order a Military Force to compel a Restitution of the Goods--for the granting a Passport is a necessary incident of War, and which therefore they may constitutionally render efficacious. What People indeed will ever put any Confidence in us if our Passports will not protect them? No Act of this Legislature has yet passed with Regard to the Wyoming Settlers.(2) Many Gentlemen assure Me that if it shall be in their Power they Shall be treated with great Liberality. I flatter myself that it will be done. I shall extremely regret if those who have settled under a publick Incouragment shall in any respect suffer with regard to their Possessions. My kindest respects to Mr. Lyman and his Lady. Yours, Oliver Wolcott JANUARY 23, 1783  P.S. I wrote to you by the last Post. ""

  Thursday 23 Decr. [i.e., January 1783] The Report of the come. last mentioned (1) consisting of a state of the variations in the Treaty of Amity & commerce with the States General from the plan proposed by Congress, of a ratification of the sd Treaty & of the Convention, & of a proclamation comprehending both was accepted & passed; the variations excepted wch. were not meant to be entered on the journals.(2) Both the Committee & Congress were exceedingly chagrined at the extreme incorrectness of the American copies of these national acts, and it was privately talked of as necessary to admonish Mr. Adams thereof, & direct him to procure with the concurrence of the other party a more correct & perspicuous copy. The Report of the Come. as agreed to, havg. left a blank in the act of ratifiction for the insertion of the Treaty & Convention, & these being contained both in the Dutch & American languages, the former column signed by the Dutch Plenpos. only & the latter by Mr. Adams only, the Secy. asked the direction of Congs. whether both columns or the American only ought to [be] inserted. On this point several observations were made & different opinions expressed. In general the members seemed to disaprove of the mode usd & would have preferrd the use of a neutral language. As to the request of the Secy. Mr. Wilson was of opinion that the American Columns only sd. be inserted. Several others concurred in this opinion; supposing that as Mr. Adams had only signed those columns, our ratifications ought to be limited to them. Those who were of a different opinion, considered the two parts as inseparable & as forming one whole, & consequently that both ought to be inserted. The case being a new one to Congress, it was proposed & admitted that the insertion might be suspended till the next day, by which time some authorities might be consulted on the subject. A come. consisting of Mr. Madison, Mr. Mifflin & Mr. Williamson reported in consequence of a motion of Mr. Bland, a list of books proper for the use of Congress, and proposed that the Secy. sho'd be instructed to procure the same.(3) In favr. of the Rept. it was urged as indispensable that Congress sd. have at all times at command such authors on the law of Nations, treaties, Negociations &c as wd. render their proceedings in such cases conformable to propriety; and it was observed that the want of this information was manifest in several important acts of Congress. It was further observed that no time ought  JANUARY 23, 1783  to be lost in collecting every book & tract which related to American Antiquities & the affairs of the U.S. since many of the most valuable of these were every day becoming extinct, & they were necessary not only as materials for a Hist. of the U.S. but might be rendered still more so by future pretensions agst. their rights from Spain or other powers which had shared in the discoveries & possessions of the New World.(4) Agst. the Report were urged 1st. the inconveniency of advancing even a few hundred pounds at this crisis; 2dly. the difference of expence between procuring the books during the war & after a peace. These objections prevailed, by a considerable majority. A motion was then made by Mr. Wilson 2ded by Mr. M[adison] to confine the purchase for the present to the most essential part of the books. This also was negatived.(5) ""

  Sir. Philadelphia Jany 24th 1783 I have the pleasure to Inform you at length that the Grant made to the representatives of your late brother as Commsy Genll is closed and ascertaind in Congress but not before yesterday, the money he receivd and expended to be reduced to its real Value after any Depreciation took place tho antecedent to the Scale of Depreciation  JANUARY 24, 1783  fixd by Congress and that the Commissions Granted by Congress in 1779 be allowd thereon computed as in specie,(1) which by Mr Barrel's present Computation will bring the ballance due to about perhaps a little short of 30,000 dollars in specie, but Mr Barrel Complains that he cannot affix the ballance with precission as he has not the means to ascertain the exact time when all the monies were receivd & particularly the 21,000 dollars which appears he has receivd over and above what he has paid out & expended, & which must be reconed against him as part pay, it appears that this sum arises against him on account of his receiving back part of the monies he had before delivered out to the sub Commissys &c. I tell him it ought to be considered as of the last moneys he recievd, which I suppose was in 1778 which would reduce that sum to not more than about 5000 dollars in specie, but if you can ascertain that matter I wish you would send it as soon as you can and any other matter which will Conduce to a just settlement of the Account. I dare not mention a word in Congress with respect to the Intrest for reasons I can tell you, but rather think that Barrel looks upon it, that he is Warranted to allow Intrest how far back I cannot say for I am oblidgd to manage every thing about it with utmost Caution. You may wonder that the matter has not been sooner accomplishd. I have wrote you several times & hinted at some reasons. I have spared no pains to bring it to a Close, but have often found it would not do, then have been oblidgd to have it delayd for a better oppertunity, as I could find till lately no one that would so far attend to the affair as to give it any great advantage. I have allready Informd you it has been committed & recommitted Sundry times and that Congress had taken up the matter so as to pay no regard to the Grant in 1779 but to Instruct the Comtee barely to consider the real Sum that was right to allow your brother by the year during the time he was in service, and at length after a month or six weeks they reported a gross Sum of 12,000 Dollars. I feard the Consequence on that report which Clymer & Jackson Consented to & got it postponed till I should return from Trenton, when I knew there would be many new Members & Genll Mifflin one from Pensylvania, I made it my business after my return to take every oppertunity with the members to let them into a true knowledge of the affair to Shew them the injustice of Congress to recede from the Grant heretofore made and to Interest them that justice might be done untill I thot I was pretty sure. Then I Ventured to bring it on, and to move that the last report might be postponed, and to Confine themselves to the Grant before made in 1779, which after being debated, and put off a day or two gave me time further to rectify any misapprehensions of particular members, and to gain some friends to take up the matter in its just View, in which Genll Mifflin was not wanting to exert himself. It was finally carried by an Unanimous Vote of the States present, and only Burks Substitute from   North Carolina Violently opposing (2) tho his Colleagues Viz, the late Govr Nash, Coll Blunt &c Voting against him, but on the whole I am sure if I had not been here with Mrs Trumbull, (3) not half the sum would ever have been obtaind & probable not brot to a Close these seven Years. But now what have you to receive but Certificates on Intrest and no fund for payment either of one or the other but if we could obtain an appropriated fund for Interest of the Loans & Debts they would become of Value and Transferrable Stock with perhaps but little loss otherwise if that cannot soon be done we are all adrift and the Ship must Sink. Congress are now most earnestly engaged on that Subject, and a few day believe will bring it to a Close in Congress, but after that we have the several States to adopt & Confirm it, the Impost will be further Insisted on, but however, Certificates must be taken, if long delayd some curious fellow may bring it before Congress again for explanation. I imagine you would not choose to have the whole sum included in one Certificate, but divided into a Number of different denominations. I wish you to write me Immediately on that head, & I have further to ask you to give orders that one half or at least £3000 or 4000 may be made out to Mrs Trumbull as that will leave upwards of £3000 (4) to be applied towards Debts beside what you have in your own hands towards paying of Debts which I think must amply Answer, but this I ask only on Mrs Trumbull giving bond with my Security with her to refund in case wanted for that purpose, which is according to the Laws of our State. You know the Estate has lay long unsetled & I hope you will now make no delay in bringing of it As near to a Close as circumstances will admit. Mrs. Trumbull has been here near a year waiting for this Affair of the Grant to be closed by Congress, and no means of support but from me who am but little able at present to bare it, & am Very sure the one half never would have been otherwise obtaind. Mrs Trumbull is out of Town at Genll Mifflins. Am yours &c. Elipht Dyer ""

  Friday Jany. 24th [1783]. Some days prior to this sundry papers had been laid before Congress by the war office,(1) shewing that a Cargo of Supplies which had arrived at Wilmi[n]gton for the British & German Prisoners of war under a passport from the Commander in cheif and which were thence proceeding by land to their distination, had been siezed by sundry persons in Chester County under a law of Pennsa. wch. required in Such cases a licence from the Executive authority, which exposed to confiscation all articles not necessary for the prisoners, & referrd. the question of necessity to the judgment of its own Magistrates. Congress unanimously considered the violation of the passport issued under their authority as an encroachment on their constitutional & essential rights; but being disposed to get over the difficulty  JANUARY 24, 1783  as gently as possible appointed a Come. consisting of Mr. Rutlidge, Mr. Wolcot & Mr. M[adison], to confer with the Executive of Pa. on the subject. In the first conference the Executive represented to the Committee the concern they felt at the incident, their disposition to respect & support the dignity & rights of the foederal Sovereignty; and the embarrassments in which they were involved by recent & express law of the State to which they were bound to conform. The Come. observed to them that the power of granting passports for the purpose in question being inseparable from the general power of war delegated, to Congress, & being essential for conducting the war, it could not be expected that Congress wd. acquiesce in any infractions upon it; that as Pa. had concurred in this alienation to Congress, any law whatever contravening this power of Congs. was necessaryly void, and cd. impose no obligation on the Executive. The latter requested further time for a consideration of the case & laid it before the Legislature then sitting; in consequence of which a Come. of their body was appd. jointly with the Executive to confer with the Committee of Congress. In this 2d conference the first remarks made by the Come. of Congress were repeated. The Come. of the Legislature expressed an unwillingness to intrench on the jurisdiction of Congress, but some of them seemed not to be fully satisfied that the law of the State did so. Mr. Montgomery lately a member of Congress observed that altho' the general power of war was given to Congress yet that the mode of exercising that power might be regulated by the States in any manner which wd. not frustrate the power, & which their policy might require. To this it was answered that if Congress had the power at all, it could not either by the Articles of Confederation or the reason of things admit of such a controuling power in each of the States, & that to admit such a construction wd. be a virtual surrender to the States of the whole federal power relative to war; the most essential of all the powers delegated to Congress. The Come of the Legis[latu]re represented as the great difficulty with them, that even a repeal of the law wd. not remedy the case without a retrospective law which their Constitution wd. not admit of, & expressed an earnest desire that some accomodating plan might be hit upon. They proposed in order to induce the siezors to wave their appeal to the law of the State, that Congress wd. allow them to appt. one of two persons who sd. have authority to examine into the supplies & decide whether they comprehended any articles that were not warranted by the passport. The Come. of Congress answered that whatever obstacles might lie in the way of redress by the Legislature, if no redress proceeded from them, equal difficulties wd. lie on the other side, since Congress in case of a confiscation of the supplies under the law which the omission of some formalities reqd. by it wd. probably produce, would be obliged by honor & good faith to indemnify the Enemy for their loss out of the   common Treasury; that the other States wd. probably demand a reimbursemt. to the U. S. from Pa. & that it was impossible to say to what extremity the affair might be carried. They observed to the Come. of the Legre. and the Executive, that Congress altho' disposed to make all allowances, and particularly in the case of a law passed for a purpose recommended by themselves, yet they cd. not condescend to any expedient which in any manner departed from the respect wch. they owed to themselves & to the articles of Union. The Come. of Congress however suggested that as the only expedient wch. wd. get rid of the clashing of the power of Congress & the Law of the State, wd. be the dissuading the siezors from their appeal to the latter, it was probable that if the Siezors wd. apply to Congress for Redress that such steps wd. [be] taken as wd. be satisfactory. This hint was embraced & both the Executive & the Come. of the Legre. promised to use their influence with the persons of most influence among the siezors for that purpose. In consequence thereof a Memorial from (see Journal) was sent in to Congress, committed to the same Come. of Congress, (2) & their report of this day agreed to in wch. the Presidt. of Pa. is requested to appt. one of the referees. It is proper to observe that this business was conducted with great temper & harmony, & that Presidt. Dickenson in particulr manifested throughout the course of it, as great a desire to save the rights & dignity of Congress as those of the State over which he presided. As a few of the Siezors only were parties to the Memorial to Congress, it is still uncertain whe[the]r others may not adhere to their claims under the law in wch. case all the embarrassments will be revived. In a late report which had been drawn up by Mr. H.(3) & made to Congress, in answr. to a Memorial from the Legislatre. of Pa. (see ) among other things shewing the impossibility Congress had been under of payg. their Credrs. it was observed that the aid afforded by the Ct. of France had been appropriated by that Court at the time to the immediate use of the army. This clause was objected to as unnecessary, & as dishonorable to Congress. The fact also was controverted. Mr. Hamilton & Mr. Fitzimmons justified the expediency of retaing it, in order to justify Congress the more completely in failing in their engagements to the public Creditors. Mr. Wilson & Mr. Madison proposed to strike out the words appropriated by France, & substitute the words applied by Congress to the immediate & necessary support of the army. This proposition wd. have been readily approved had it not appeared on examination that in one or two small instances, & particularly in the paymt. of the balance due to A. Lee Esqr. other applications had been made of the aid in question. The report was finally recommitted.(4) A letter from the Supernt. of Finance was recd & read, acquaintg Congress that as the danger from the Enemy which led him into the Dept. was disappearing & he saw little prospect of provision being   made without, injustice wd. take place of which he wd. never be the Minister, he proposed not to serve longer than may next, unless proper provision sd. be made.(5) This letter made a deep & solemn impression on Congress. It was considered as the effect of despondence in Mr. M. of seeing justice done to the public Credtrs. or the public finances placed on an honorable establishmt., as a Source of fresh hopes to the enemy when known, as ruinous both to domestic & foreign Credit; & as producing a vacancy which no one knew how to fill & which no fit man wd. venture to accept. Mr. Ghoram after observing that the Administration of Mr. M. had inspired great confidence and expectation in his State, & expressing his extreme regret at the event, moved that the letter sd. be committed. This was opposed as unnecessary & nugatory by Mr. W. since the known firmness of Mr. M. after deliberately taking a step wd. render all attempts to dissuade him fruitless; and that as the Memorial from the Army had bro' t the subject of funds before Congress, there was no other object for a Committee. The motion was disagd to. Mr. Wilson then moved that a day might be assigned for the consideration of the letter. Agst. the propriety of this it was observd. by Mr. [Madison] that the same reasons which opposed a Commitment opposed the assignment of day. Since Congress cd. not however anxious their wishes or alarming their apprehensions might be, condescend to solicit Mr. M. even if there were a chance of its being successful; & since it wd. be equally improper for Congress, however cogent a motive it might add in the mind of every member, to struggle for substantial funds, to let such a consideration appear in their public acts, on that subject, The motion was not pressed <<& was thrown out>. Congress supposing that a knowledge of Mr. Mo[rri]s' intentions wd. anticipate the ills likely to attend his actual resignation, ordered his letter to be kept secret.(6) Nothing being said to day as to the mode of insertion of the Treaty & Convention (7) the Secy. proceeded in retaining both columns. In consequence of the report to the Grand Committee on the memorial from the army, by the Subcomme, the following report was made by the former to Congs. and came under consideration to day. \""(8) The Grand Committee having considered the Contents of the Meml. presented by the army, find that they comprehend five different articles: 1. Present pay. 2. A settlemt. of accts. of the arrearages of pay and security for what is due. 3. A commutation of the half pay allowed by differt. resolutions of Congress for an equivalent in gross. 4. A settlemt. of the accts. of deficiencies of rations & compensation. 5. A settlemt. of accts. of deficiencies of cloathing & compensation. The Committee are of opinion with respect to the 1st that the Superintendt. of finance be directed, conformable to the measures already   taken for that purpose, as soon as the State of the public finances will permit, to make such payt. & in such manner as he shall think proper till the further order of Congress. With respect to the 2d art. so far as relates to the settlemt. of accts, that the several States be called upon to compleat the settlemt., without delay, with their respective lines of the army up to the 1st (9) day of Aug. 1780; that the Supert. be also directed to take such measures as shall appear to him most proper & effectual for accomplishing the object in the most equitable & satisfactory manner, havg. regard to former resolutions of Congs. & to the settlemts. made in consequence thereof. And so far as relates to the providing of security for what shall be found due on such settlemt.--Resolved that the troops of the United States in common with all the Creditrs. of the same, have an undoubted right to expect such security, and that Congress will make every effort in their power to obtain from the respective States, general & substantial funds adequate to the object of funding the whole debt of the U. S. and that Congs. ought to enter upon an immediate & full consideration of the nature of such funds & the most likely mode of obtaining them. With respect to the 3d Article the Comme. are of opinion that it will be expedient for Congs. to leave it to the option of all officers entitled to half pay, either to preserve their claim to that provision as it now stands by the several resolutions of Congs. upon that subject or to accept years (10) full pay to be paid to them in one year after the conclusion of the war in money or placed upon good funded security bearing an annual interest of 6 prCt.--provided that the allowance to widows & orphans of such officers as have died or been killed or may die or be killed in the service during the war shall remain as established by the resolution of the day of .(11) With respect to the 4 & 5 Art. the Come. beg leave to delay their report untill they have obtained more precise information than they now possess on the subject.\"" The 1st Clause of this report relative to immediate pay passed yesterday.(12) The Supt. had agreed to make out 1 month's pay. Indeed long before the arrival of the deputies from the army he had made contingent & secret provision for that purpose; and to ensure it now he meant if necessary to draw bills on the late application for loans. The words \""conformable to measures already taken\"" referred to the above secret provisn, and were meant to shew that the payment to the army did not originate in the Memol. but in an antecedent attention to the wants of the army. In the discussion of the 2d clause, the epoch of Aug. 1780 was objected to, by the Eastern delegates. Their States havg. settled with their lines down to later periods, they wish now to obtain the Sanction of Congress to them. After some debate, a compromise was proposed by Mr. Hamilton by substituting the last day of Decr. 1780. This was agreed to without opposition altho several members disliked it. The   latter part of the clause beginning with the word Resolved &c. was considered as a very solemn point, and the basis of the plans by which the public engagements were to be fulfilled & the union cemented. A motion was made by Mr. Bland to insert after the words \""in their power\"" the words, \""consistent with the Articles of Confederation[\""]. This amendment as he explained it was not intended to contravene the idea of funds extraneous to the federal articles, but to leave those funds for a consideration subsequent to providing Constitutional ones. Mr. Arnold however eagerly 2ded it. No question however was taken on it, Congress deeming it proper to postpone the matter till the next day, as of the most solemn nature; and to have as full a representation as possible. With this view & to get rid of Mr. Bland's motion, they adjourned; & ordered all the members not present & in town to be summoned. ""

  Sir Philadelphia Jany 25th 1783 There is a Deputation from the Army viz Genll McDougall &c who have been waiting here some time. Their application to Congress is for some imediate pay, and for a Liquidation & adjustment of their past Accounts, a further Assurance of their half pay as before Established, or by Commutation, &c &c.(1) It is well known that Congress some time agoe recommended to the several States to take up the Matter of a settlement and adjustment with the officers & soldiers of their respective lines for pay, depretiation &c, that in Consequence thereof Connecticut with several other of the States took up the matter and at great trouble and expence have settled the account for pay & Depreciation, Some down as far as & including the Year 1781. Connecticut As I recollect are proceeding so far as that, but yet whether finished, compleated & secureties given I know not. Congress have taken up the Matter upon application of the Agents from the Army, and on Examination it is found that the southern States have done Nothing in persuance of the former recommendation of Congress, and their lines remain to be settled with for pay and Depreciation from the Year 1777, and which has been strenously Urged should now be done by the Financier in a Continental way, & hereby the whole pay & depreciation of officers & soldiers by those States who have faild of a Compliance with the former resolution would be a general Charge on the United States even of those who have settled &  JANUARY 25, 1783  involved themselves in a Very heavy debt for the payment of their officers & soldiers of their line. The Injustice of the measure was strongly Urged & opposed, but after Various debates and producing a resolution of Congress of August 1780 taking up the pay of the Army in a Continental way it was urged, that was at least a Virtual repeal of the former resolution and if any State has gone so far as to settle & secure payment down to a later period they have done it in their own wrongs tho they are willing it shall be allowd to their final Credit in their Accounts to the United States, yet the Delinquent States cannot be brot up to settle with their line further than to the 1st of August 1780 and which was finally carried, Viz that those states who had not settled with their officers & soldiers & secured payment to that Date should yet do it up to August 1780; and that the Financier settle, Liquidate and secure in a Continental way only all dues since that period. At any rate I find Connecticut will be Involved in a debt Arising on the securities given from the 1st of August 1780 to the 1st of Jany 1781 but if the matter is not Closed for the Year 1781 that is to say to the 1st of January 1782. I should think the State will at once see the necessity to put a Stop to any further proceedings therein especially as the Army Including Connecticut line have by their Agents applied for a Continental Settlement; and indeed it appears to me so Interesting to the State and that they have been led into a deception in the matter that even if some securities have been given out on the Year 1781, that they will immediately put a Stop to any further Securities being given if not recall or Cancell those that have as Congress have in fact on their application ordered a Settlement for that year and even ever since 1st of August 1780 to be adjusted and settled by the Financier and the pay or securitie of the 13 united States Collectively to be given therefor, and Connecticut as well as the other States, who have settled with their lines since the last of July 1780 must be equally involved with the other States, who have not settled to pay their Troops--however unrighteous or unjust; for it is said that the officers & soldiers from every State or Continental and relye on the faith and Credit of the whole and cannot be Subjected to depend on the particular States to which they belong. I would by no means be thot to obtrude my opinion, especially one so suddenly taken up, & under some resentment, but esteemed it my Duty immediately to Communicate to the State every matter of Consequence especially one in which their Interest is so nearly affected. The repeated Calls of the Army & other Creditors to the United States highly demands the attention of Congress for some funded Security at least for the Interest; any means pointed out by Confederation are too dilatory & ineffectual; what can be done we know not, but to repeat the request for an Impost and especially to appropriate it to the Intrest of the funded Debts, and if it should at any time exceed the interest the remainder towards the principal, a   small & general Land tax is also proposed; Congress are now intent on the Subject, but they cannot come into any measure but what Must be Submitted to the inspection of the several States & have their approbation before Valid, and probably it is best it should be so, but if something is not done it seems it will soon endanger the Union, and a dissolution may follow.

  Saturday. [January 25, 1783] The Secy. of Congress havg. suggested to a member that the Contract with the Ct. of F. specifying the sums Due from the U. S. altho' extremely generous on the part of the former had been ratifyed without any such acknowledgmts. by the latter, that this was the first instance in which such acknowledgts. had been omitted, & that the omission wd. be singularly improper at a time when we were Soliciting further aids; the observations were made to Congress, the ratification reconsidered, and the words \""impressed with &c\""...inserted.(1) The rept on the memorial was resumed.(2) By Mr. Hamilton, Mr. Fitzimmons & one or two others who had conversed with Mr. Morris on the change of the last day of Decr. for the day of Augst. It was suggested that the change entirely contravened the measures pursued by his department;(3) and moved for a reconsideration of it in order to enquire into the subject. Without going into details they urged this as a reason sufficient. The Eastern delegates, altho' they wished for unanimity & system in future proceedings relative to our funds & finances were very stiff in retaining the vote wch. coincided with the steps taken by their Constituents. Of this much complaint was made. Mr. Rutlidge on this occasion alledging that Congress ought not to be led by general suggestions derived from the office of finance, joined by  JANUARY 25, 1783  Mr. Gervais, voted agst. the reconsideration. The consequence was that S. Carola. was divided & six votes only in favr. of the Reconsideration. Mr. Hamilton havg. expressed his regret at the negative & explained more exactly the interference of the change of the Epoch with the measures & plans of the Office of Finance wch. had limited all State advances & settlemts. to Aug. 1780; Mr. Rutledge acknowledged the sufficiency of the reasons & at his instance the latter date was reinstated. On this 2d. question Cont. also voted for Augst.(4) Congress proceeded to the 3d clause, relative to the commutation of half pay.(5) A motion was made by Mr. H. to fill the blank with \""six.\"" This was in conformity to tables of Dr. Price,(6) estimating the officers on the average of good lives. Liberality in the rate was urged by several as necessary to give Satisfaction & prevent a refusal of the offer. For this motion there were 6 ayes, 5 noes; the Southern States & N.Y. being in the affirmative, the Eastern & N.J. in the negative. Col. Bland proposed 6½ erroneously supposing the negative of 6 to have proceeded from its being too low. It was on the contrary rather doubtful whether the East. States wd. concur in any arrangemt. on this head; so averse were they to what they call pensions. Several having calculated that the annual amount of half-pay was between 4 & 500,000 Drs, and the interest of the gross sum funded at the rate of 6 years, nearly of that sum, Congress were struck with the necessity of proceeding with more caution & for that purpose committed the report to a Committee of 5.(7) Mr. Osgood, Mr. Fitzimmons, Mr. Gervais, &c.(8) ""

  Monday 27 Jany. 1783. A letter from Genl. Washington was rcd. notifying the death of Lord Sterling & inclosing a report of the Officer sent to apprehend Knowlton & Wells. (See ).(1) The following is an extract from the report \""he (one Israel Smith) further sd. that Knowlton & Wells had recd. a lettr. from Jonathan Arnold Esqr. at Congress part of which was made public, which informed them that affairs in Congress were unfavorable to them & wd. have them look out for themselves. What other information this letter contained he cd. not say--I found in my March thro' the State that the last mentioned gentleman was much in favor with all the principal men in that State I had any conversation with.\""(2) Mr. Arnold being present at the reading informed Congress that he was surprized how such a notion should have prevailed with respect to him; that he had never held any correspondence with  JANUARY 27, 1783  either Knowlton or Wells; and requested that he might be furnished with the extract above. In this he was indulged without opposition. But it was generally considered, notwithstanding his denial of the correspondence, that he had at least at second hand, conveyed the intelligence to Vermont.(3) A long petition was read, signed as alledged by near two thousand inhabitants (but all in the same hand writing), of the territory lately in controversy between Pa. & Va. complaining of the greivances to which their distance from public authority exposed them & particularly of the late law of Pena. interdicting even consultations about a new State within its limits; and praying that Congress wd. give a sanction to their independence & admit them into the Union. The Petition lay on the table without a single motion or remark relative to it.(4) The order of the day was called for, to wit the Resolution of Saturday last in favor of adequate & substantial funds.(5) This subject was introduced by Mr. Wilson with some judicious remarks on its importance & the necessity of a thorough & serious discussion of it. He observed that the U. States had in the course of the revolution displayed both an unexampled activity in resisting the enemy, and an unexampled patience under the losses & calamities occasioned by the war. In one point only he said they had appeared to be deficient & that was a cheerful payment of taxes. In other free Govts. it had been seen that taxation had been carried farther & more patiently borne than in States where the people were excluded from the Govts., the people considering themselves as the sovereign as well as the subject; & as receiving with one hand what they paid with the other. The peculiar repugnance of the people of the U. S. to taxes he supposed proceeded first from the odious light in which they had been under the old Govt. in the habit of regarding them; 2dely. from the direct manner in wch. taxes in this Country had been laid; whereas in all other countries taxes were paid in a way that was little felt at the time. That it cd. not proceed altogether from inability he said must be obvious: Nay that the ability of the U. S. was equal to the public burden might be demonstrated. According to the calculations of the best writers the inhabitants of G. B. paid before the present war at the annual rate of at least 25s. Sterlg per head. According to like calculations the inhabitants of the U. S. before the revolution paid indirectly & insensibly at the rate of at least 10s. Sterlg per head. According to the computed depreciation of the paper emissions, the burden insensibly borne by the inhabitants of the U. S. had amounted during the first three or four years of the war to not less than twenty Million of dollars per annum, a burden too which was the more oppressive as it fell very unequally on the people. An inability therefore could not be urged as a plea for the extreme deficiency of the revenue contributed by the States, which did not amount during the past year to 1/2 a million of dollars, that is to 1/6 of a dollar per head.   Some more effectual mode of drawing forth the resources of the Country was necessary. That in particular it was necessary that such funds should be established as would enable Congress to fulfill those engagements which they had been enabled to enter into. It was essential he contended that those to whom were delegated the power of making war & peace should in some way or other have the means of effectuating these objects; that as Congress had been under the necessity of contracting a large debt justice required that such funds should be placed in their hands as would discharge it; that such funds were also necessary for carrying on the war; and as Congress found themselves in their present situation destitute both of the faculty of paying debts already contracted, and of providing for future exigences, it was their duty to lay that situation before their constituents; and at least to come to an eclaircissement on the subject; he remarked that the establisht. of certain funds for payg wd. set afloat the public paper; adding that a public debt resting on general funds would operate as a cement to the confederacy, and might contribute to prolong its existence, after the foreign danger ceased to counteract its tendency to dissolution. He concluded with moving that it be Resol[ve]d \""That it is the opinion of Congress that complete justice cannot be done to the Creditors of the United States, nor the restoration of public credit be effected, nor the future exigences of the war provided for, but by the establishment of general funds to be collected by Congress.\"" This motion was seconded by Mr. Fitzimmons. Mr. Bland desired that Congress wd. before the discussion proceeded farther, receive a communication of sundry papers transmitted to the Virga. Delegates by the Executive of that State; two of which had relation to the question before Congress. These were 1st. a Resolution of the Genl. Assembly declaring its inability to pay more than £50,000 Va. currency towards complying with the demand of Congress. 2dly. the Act repealing the Act granting the impost of 5 PerCt. These papers were receiv'd and read.(6) Mr. Wolcot expressed some astonishment at the inconsistency of the two acts of Va.; supposed that they had an unfavorable aspect on the business before Congress; & proposed that the latter sd. be postponed for the present. He was not seconded. Mr. Ghorum favored the general idea of the motion, animadverted on the refusal of Virga. to contribute the necessary sums & at the same moment repealing her concurrence in the only scheme that promised to supply a deficiency of contributions, thought the motion however inaccurately expressed, since the word \""general\"" might be understood to refer to every possible object of taxation as well as to the operation of a particular tax throughout the States: he observed that the nonpayment of the 1,200,000 Drs. demanded by Congress for paying the interest on the <<interl> debts for the year demonstrated that the constitutional mode of annual requisitions was defective; he intimated   that lands were already sufficiently taxed; that polls & commerce were the most proper objects. At his instance the latter part of the motion was so amended as to run \""establishment of permanent & adequate funds to operate generally throughout the U. States.\"" Mr. Hamilton went extensively into the subject, the sum of it was as follows: he observed that funds considered as permanent sources of revenue were of two kinds, 1st. such as wd extend generally & uniformly throughout the U. S. & wd. be collected under the authority of Congs. 2dly. such as might be established separately within each State, & might consist of any objects which were chosen by the States, and which might be collected either under the authority of the States or of Congs. Funds of the 1st kind he contended were preferable; as being 1st more simple, the difficulties attending the mode of fixing the quotas laid down in the confederation rendering it extremely complicated & in a manner insuperable: as being more certain; since the States according to the secd. plan wd. probably retain the collection of the revenue and a vicious system of collection prevailed generally through the U. S. a system by which the collectors were chosen by the people & made their offices more subservient to their popularity than to the public revenue--& as being more OEconomical, since the collection would be effected with fewer officers under the management of Congress, than under that of the States.(7) Mr. Ghorum observed that Mr. Hamilton was mistaken in the representation he had given of the collection of taxes in several of the States; particularly in that of Massachussetts, where the collection was on a footing which rendered it sufficiently certain. Mr. Wilson having risen to explain some things which had fallen from him; threw out the suggestion that several branches of Revenue if yielded by all the States, would perhaps be more just & satisfactory than any single one; for example an impost on trade combined with a land tax. Mr. Dyer expressed a strong dislike to a collection by officers appointed under Congress, & supposed the States would never be brought to consent to it. Mr. Ramsay was decidedly in favor of the proposition. Justice he said entitled those who had lent their money & services to the U. S. to look to them for payment; that if general & certain revenues were not provided, the consequence wd. be that the army & public Creditors would have soon to look to their respective States only for satisfaction; that the burden in this case wd. fall unequally on the States; that rivalships relative to trade wd. impede a regular impost & wd. produce confusions amg. the States; that some of the States would never make of themselves provision for half pay and that the army wd. be so far defrauded of the rewards stipulated to them by Congress; that altho' it might be uncertain whether the States wd. accede to plans founded on the proposition before the house, yet as Congress was convinced of its truth & importance it was their duty to make the experiment. JANUARY 28, 1783  Mr. Bland thought that the ideas of the states on the subject were so averse to a general revenue in the hands of Congs. that if such a revenue were proper it was unattainable; that as the deficiency of the contributions from the States proceeded not from8 complaints of their inability but of the inequality of the apportionments, it would be a wiser course to pursue the rule of the confederation, to wit to ground the requisition on an actual valuation of lands; that Congress wd. then stand on firm ground & try a practicable mode.

  Tuesday Jany. 28th. 1783 The subject yesterday under discussion was resumed. A division of the question was called for by Mr. Wolcott so as to have a distinct question on the \""words to be collected by Congress\"" wch. he did not like.(1) Mr. Wilson considered this mode of collection as essential to the idea of a general revenue, since without it the proceeds of the revenue wd. depend entirely on the punctuality, energy & unanimity of the States, the want of which led to the present consideration. Mr. Hamilton was strenuously of the same opinion. Mr. Fitzimmons informed Congress that the Legislature of Penna. had at their last meeting been dissuaded from appropriating their revenue to the payment of their own Citizens Creditors of the U. S. instead of remitting it to the continental treasury; merely by the urgent representations of a Committee of Congress & by the hope that some general system in favr. of all the public creditors would be adopted; that the Legislature were now again assembled; and altho sensible of the tendency of such an example, thought it their duty & meant in case the prospect of such a system vanished to proceed immediately to the separate appropriations formerly in contemplation. On the motion of Mr. [Madison] the whole proposition was new-modelled as follows; \""That it is the opinion of Congress that the establishment of permanent & adequate funds to operate generally throughout the U. States is indispensibly necessary for doing complete justice to the Creditors of the U. S., for restoring public credit, & for providing for the future exigences of the war.\"" The words \""to be collected under the authority of Congress[\""] were as a seperate question left to be added afterwards. Mr. Rutlidge objected to the term \""generally\"", as implying a degree of uniformity in the tax which would render it unequal. He had in view particularly a land tax according to quantity as had been proposed by the office of finance. He thought the prejudices of the people opposed to the idea of a general tax & seemed on the whole to be disinclined to it himself, at least if extended beyond an impost on  JANUARY 28, 1783  trade; urging the necessity of pursuing a valuation of land, and requisitions grounded thereon. Mr. Lee 2ded. the opposition to the term \""general.\"" He contended that the States wd. never consent to a uniform tax because it wd. be unequal; that it was moreover repugnant to the articles of confederation; and by placing the purse in the same hands with the sword, was subversive of the fundamental principles of liberty. He mentioned the repeal of the impost by Virga. himself alone opposing it & that too on the inexpediency in point of time as proof of the aversion to a general revenue. He reasoned upon the subject finally as if it was proposed that Congress sd. assume & exercise a power immediately & without the previous Sanction of the States, of levying money on them. In consequence, Mr Wilson rose & explained the import of the motion to be that Congress should recommend to the States the investing them with power. He observed that the confederation was so far from precluding, that it expressly provided for future alterations; that the power given to Congress by that Act was too little not too formidable, that there was more of a centrifugal than centripetal force in the States, & that the funding of a common debt in the manner proposed would produce a salutary invigoration & cement of the Union. Mr. Elseworth acknowledged himself to be undecided in his opinion: that on the one side he felt the necessity of continental funds for making good the continental engagements but on the other desponded of a unanimous concurrence of the States in such an establishment. He observed that it was a question of great importance how far the federal govt. can or ought to exert coercion against delinquent members of the confederacy; & that without such coercion no certainty could attend the constitutional mode which referred every thing to the unanimous punctuality of thirteen different councils. Considering therefore a continental revenue as unattainable, and periodical requisitions from Congress as inadequate, he was inclined to make trial of the middle mode of permanent State funds, to be provided at the recommendation of Congs. and appropriated to the discharge of the common debt. Mr. Hamilton in reply to Mr. Elseworth dwelt long on the inefficacy of State funds, He supposed too that greater obstacles would arise to the execution of the plan than to that of a general revenue. As an additional reason for the latter to be collected by officers under the appointment of Congress, he signified that as the energy of the fOEderal Govt. was evidently short of the degree necessary for pervading & uniting the States it was expedient to introduce the influence of of officers deriving their emoluments from & consequently interested in supporting the power of, Congress.(2) Mr. Williamson was of opinion that continental funds altho' desirable, were unattainable at least to the full amount of the public exigences. He thought if they could be obtained for the foreign debt, it   would be as much as could be expected, and that they would also be less essential for the domestic debt. Mr. Madison observed that it was needless to go into proofs of the necessity of payg. the public debts; that the idea of erecting our national independence on the ruins of public faith and national honor must be horrid to every mind which retained either honesty or pride; that the motion before Congress contained a simple proposition with respect to the truth of which every member was called upon to give his opinion. That this opinion must necessarily be in the affirmative, unless the several objects; of doing justice to the public Creditors, &c &c, could be compassed by some other plan than the one proposed, that the 2 last objects depended essentially on the first; since the doing justice to the Creditors alone wd. restore publi[c] credit, & the restoration of this alone could provide for the future exigencies of the war. Is then a continl revenue indispensibly necessary for doing complete justice &? This is the question. To answer it the other plans proposed must first be reviewed. In order to do complete justice to the public Creditors, either the principal must be paid off, or the interest paid punctually. The 1st. is admitted to be impossible on any plan. The only plans opposed to the continl one for the latter purpose; are 1st. periodical requisitions according to the fOEderal articles: 2dly. permanent funds established by each State within itself & the proceeds consigned to the discharge of public debts. Will the 1st be adequate to the object? The contrary seems to be maintained by no one. If reason did not sufficiently premonish, experience has sufficiently demonstrated that a punctual & unfailing compliance by 13 separate & independent Govts. with periodical demands of money from Congress, can never be reckoned upon with the certainty requisite to satisfy our present creditors, or to tempt others to become our creditors in future. 2dly. Will funds separately established within each State & the amount submitted to the appropriation of Congress be adequate to the object? The only advantage which is thought to recommend this plan, is that the States will be with less difficulty prevailed upon to adopt it. Its imperfections are 1st. that it must he preceded by a final & satisfactory adjustment of all accts. between the U. S. and individual States; and by an apportionment founded on a valuation of all the lands throughout each of the States in pursuance of the law of the confederation: for although the States do not as yet insist on these prerequisites in the case of annual demands on them with wch. they very little comply & that only in the way of an open acct.; yet these conditions wd. certainly be exacted in case of a permanent cession of revenue; and the difficulties & delays to say the least incident to these conditions, can escape no one. 2dly. the produce of the funds being always in the first instance in the hands & under the controul of the   States separately, might at any time & on various pretences, be diverted to State-objects. 3dly. That jealousy which is as natural to the States as to individuals & of which so many proofs have appeared, that others will not fulfil their respective portions of the common obligations, will be continually & mutually suspending remittances to the common treasury, until it finally stops them altogether. These imperfections are too radical to be admitted into any plan intended for the purposes in question. It remains to examine the merits of the plan of a general revenue operating throughout the U. S. under the superintendence of  Congress. One obvious advantage is suggested by the last objection to separate revenues in the different States; that is, it will exclude all jealousy among them on that head, since each will know whilst it is submitting to the tax, that all the others are necessaryly at the same instant bearing their respective portions of the burden. Another advantage attending a general revenue is that in case of the concurrence of the States in establishing it, it would become soonest productive; and would consequently soonest obtain the objects in view. Nay so assured a prospect would give instantaneous confidence & content to the public creditors at home & abroad, and place our affairs in the most happy train. Again it will take from the States the opportunity as well as the temptation to divert their incomes from the general to internal purposes since these incomes will pass directly into the treasury of the U S.(3) That the consequences of with respect to the Union, of omitting such a provision for the debts of Union also claimed particular attention. The tenor of the memorial from Penna. and of the information just given on the floor by Mr. F one of its delegates rendered it extremely probable that that State would as soon as it sd. be known that Congress had declined such provision or the States rejected it, appropriate the revenue required by Congress, to the payment of its own Citizens & troops, creditors of the U.S. The irregular conduct of other States on this subject enforced by such an example could not fail to spread the evil throughout the whole continent. What then wd become of the confederation? What wd. be the authority of Congress? Wt. the tie by which the States cd. be held together? What the source by which the army could be subsisted & cloathed? What the mode of dividing & discharging our foreign debts? What the rule of settling the internal accts? What the tribunal by which controversies amg the States could be adjudicated? It ought to be carefully remembered that this subject was brought before Congress by a very solemn appeal from the army to the justice & gratitude of their Country. Besides immediate pay, they ask for permanent security for arrears. Is not this request a reasonable one? will it be just or politic to pass over the only adequate security that can be   devised, & instead of fulfilling the stipulations of the U. S. to them, to leave them to seek their rewards separately from the States to which they respectively belong? The patience of the army has been equal to their bravery, but that patience must have its limits; and the result of despair cannot be foreseen, nor ought it to be risked. It has been objected agst. a general revenue that it contravenes the articles of confederation. These Articles as has been observed have presupposed the necessity of alterations in the fOEderal system & have left a door open for them: They more[over] authorize Congress to borrow money. Now in order to borrow money permanent & certain provision is necessary, & if this provision cannot be made in any other way as has been shewn, a general revenue is within the spirit of the confederation. It has been objected that such a revenue is subversive of the soverignty & liberty of the States. If it were to be assumed without the free gift of the States this objection might be of force, but no assumption is proposed. In fact Congress are already invested by the States with the constitutional authority over the purse as well as the sword. A general revenue would only give this authority a more certain & equal efficacy. They have a right to fix the quantum of money necessary for the common purposes. The right of the States is limited to the mode of supply. A requisition of Congress on the States for money is as much a law to them; and their revenue acts when passed are laws to their respective Citizens. If for want of the faculty or means of enforcing a requisition, the law of Congress proves inefficient; does it not follow that in order to fullfil the views of the fOEderal constitution, such a change sd. be made as will render it efficient? Without such efficiency the end of this Constitution which is to preserve order & justice among the members of the Union, must fail; as without a like efficiency would the end of State constitutions wch. is to preserve like order & justice among its members. It has been objected that the States have manifested such aversion to the impost on trade as renders any recommendations of a general revenue hopeless & imprudent. It must be admitted that the conduct of the States on that subject is less encouraging than were to be wished. A review of it however does not excite despondence. The impost was adopted immediately & in its utmost latitude by several of the States. Several also which complied partially with it at first, have since complied more liberally. One of them after long refusal has complied substantially. Two States only have failed altogether & as to one of them it is not known that its failure has proceeded from a decided opposition to it. On the whole it appears that the necessity & reasonableness of the scheme have been gaining ground among the States. He was aware that one exception ought to be made to this inference: an exception too wch peculiarly concerned him to advert   to. The State of Virga as appears by an Act yesterday laid before Congress, has withdrawn its assent once given to the scheme. This circumstance cd. not but produce some embarrassment in a representative of that State advocating the scheme, one too whose principles were extremely unfavorable to a disregd. of the sense of Constitnts. But it ought not to deter him from listening to considerations which in the present case ought to prevail over it. One of these considerations was that altho' the delegates who compose Congress, more immediately represented & were amenable to the States from which they respectively come, yet in another view they owed a fidelity to the collective interests of the whole. 2dly. Altho' not only the express instructions, but even the declared sense of constituents as in the present case, were to be a law in general to the representatives, still there were occasions on which the latter ought to hazard personal consequences from a respect to what his clear conviction determines to be the true interest of the former; and the present he conceived to fall under this exception. Lastly the part he took on the present occasion was the more fully justified to his own mind by his thorough persuasion, that with the same knowledge of public affairs which his station commanded,(4) the Legislature of Va would not have repealed the law in favor of the impost & would even now rescind the repeal. The result of these observations was that it was the duty of Congress under whose authority the public debts had been contracted to aim at a general revenue as the only means of discharging them; & that this dictate of justice & gratitude was enforced by a regard to the preservation of the confederacy, to our reputation abroad & to our internal tranquility. Mr. Rutledge complained that those who so strenuously urged the necessity & competency of a general revenue operating (5) throughout all the States at the same time, declined specifying any general objects from which such a revenue could be drawn. He was thought to insinuate that these objects were kept back intentionally untill the general principle cd. be irrevocably fixed when Congs. wd. be bound at all events to go on with the project, whereupon Mr. Fitzimmons expressed some concern at the turn wch. the discussion seemed to be taking. He said that unless mutual confidence prevailed no progress could be made towards the attainment of those ends wch. all in some way or other aimed at. It was a mistake to suppose that any specific plan had been preconcerted among the patrons of a general revenue. Mr. Wilson with whom the motion originated gave his assurances that it was neither the effect of preconcert with others, nor of any determinate plan matured by himself, that he had been led into it, by the declaration on Saturday last by Congs. that substantial funds ought to be provided; by the memor[i]al of the army from which that declaration had resulted, by the memorials from the State of Pa. holding out the idea of separate appropriations of her revenue unless provision were made for the public creditors, by the   deplorable & dishonorable situation of public affairs which had compelled Congress to draw bills on the unpromised & contingent bounty of their ally, and which was likely to banish the Superintdt. of Finance whose place cd not be supplied, from his department. He observed that he had not introduced details into the debate because he thought them premature, until a general principle should be fixed; and that as soon as the pri[n]ciple sd. be fixed he would altho' not furnished with any digested plan, contribute all in his power to the forming such a one. Mr. Rutlidge moved that the proposition might be committed in order that some practicable plan might be reported, before Congress sd. declare that it ought to be adopted. Mr. Izard 2ded. the motion from a conciliating view. Mr. [Madison] thought the commitment unnecessary: and would have the appearance of delay; that too much delay had already taken place, that the deputation of the army had a right to expect an answer to their memorial as soon as it could be decided by Congress. He differed from Mr. W. in thinking that a specification of the objects of a general revenue would be improper, and thought that those who doubted of its practicability had a right to expect proof of it from details before they cd. be expected to assent to the general principle; but he differred also from Mr. R. who thought a commitment necessary for the purpose; since his views would be answered by leaving the motion before the house and giving the debate a greater latitude. He suggested as practicable objects of a general revenue, 1st. an impost on trade, 2dly. a poll tax under certain qualifications, 3dly. a land tax under do.(6) Mr. Hamilton suggested a house & window tax.(7) He was in favor of the mode of conducting the discussion urged by Mr. Madison. On the motion for the commt. 6 States were in favor of it, & five agst. it, so it was lost--in this vote the merits of the main proposition very little entered. Mr. Lee said that it was a waste of time to be forming resolutions & settling principles on this subject. He asked whether these wd. ever bring any money into the public treasury. His opinion was that Congress ought in order to guard agst. the inconveniency of meetings of the different Legislatures at different & even distant periods, to call upon the Executives to convoke them all at one period, & to lay before them a full state of our public affairs. He said the States would never agree to those plans which tended to aggrandize Congress; that they were jealous of the power of Congress; & that he acknowledged himself to be one of those who thought this jealousy not an unreasonable one; that no one who had ever opened a page or read a line on the subject of liberty, could be insensible to the danger of surrendering the purse into the same hand which held the sword.(8) The debate was suspended by an adjournment.

Notwithstanding the precariousness of the passage over the Susquehanna your favor of the 15th inst. was duly recd. yesterday.(1) I will mention to Mr. J.(2) your apology for the failure of the remittance, but if I mistake not it will be very little necessary, he having settled the affair of Mr. H.(3) in a way that does not require the payment in question. The revival of Com[mittees] would be a ticklish experiment, and I concieve not admissible but in the last necessity. Would not the circulation of a free & well informed gazette sufficiently counteract the malignant rumours wch. require some antidote? The preparation & circulation of such a paper wd. be a much more easy & OEconomical task, than the services which the other expedient would impose if extended throughout the Country, besides that it would produce other useful effects & be liable to no objections. The state of darkness in which the people are left in Va. by the want of a diffusion of intelligence is I find a subject of complaint. Yesterday was imployed in agitating the expediency of a proposition declaring it to be the \""opinion of Congress that the establishment of Genl funds is essential for doing complete justice to the Creditors of the U.S. for restoring public credit, & for providing for the exigences  JANUARY 28, 1783  of the war.\"" The subject was brought on by the Memorial from the army.(4) Such of the Virga. Delegates as concur in this opinion are put in a delicate situation by the preamble to the late repeal of the impost. Persuaded as I am however of the truth of the proposition, & believing as I do that with the same knowledge of facts which my station commands, my Constituents would never have passed that act, and would now rescind it, my assent will be hazarded. For many reasons which I have not time to explain in cypher it is my decided opinion that unless such funds be established, the foundations of our Independence will be laid in injustice & dishonor, and that the advantages of the Revolution dependent on the fOEderal compact will be of short duration. We yesterday laid before Congress sundry papers transmitted by the Govr. The light in which the protest of inability to pay the annual requisition, compared with the repeal of the Impost law placed Virga. did not you may be sure escape observation.(5) Penna. continues to be visited by the consequences of her patronage of Vermont. A Petation from the inhabitants of territory lately in dispute between her & Virga. was yesterday read in Congs. complaining among other grievances of the interdict agst. even consultations on the subject of a new State within the limits of the former; and praying for the sanction of Congress to their independence, & for an admission into the Union.(6) Mr. J____on left us on Sunday morning for Baltimore where he is to embark on a French frigate.(7) Col. Bland had arrived at the date of my last. Mr. Lee arrived on Sunday. We hear nothing of Mr. Mercer more than that he may be soon expected.(8) The only despaches recd. since my last from abroad, are those from Mr. Adams containing copies of the Treaty of Amity & commerce with the U.

The language of the American column is obscure, abounding in foreign idioms & new coined words, with bad grammar & mispellings. They have been ratified & will as soon as possible be proclaimed. It became a question in Congress on which intelligent members were divided whether both columns or the American only ought to be inserted in the act of ratification. The former mode will be pursued.(9) If yr. Library or your recollection can decide the point, favor me with the information. ""

  Sir, Philadelphia January the 28th 1783 After passing an ordinance for regulating the Post Office; the southern States have at length obtained a resolution of Congess \""That the Postmaster general be directed To continue the Southern Post to Savannah in Georgia, and that the Superintendant of Finance furnish the money necessary for the purpose.\""(1) By our Confederation Congress is not permitted to raise a revenue out of the Profits of the Post Office. But that office should maintain itself in the time of Peace, it doubtless will; with the addition of many by-Posts. At present, it would pay its own expence from Boston to Petersburg. But the further continuation will prove a tax on the Treasury of near two thirds of the expence of Post riders. Under the British Government for similar reasons the post did not ride on the Southern roads more than once a fortnight. He is now ordered to ride once a week: and if we have industry & wisdom enough to promote the trade of our Country, it is hoped that our Commercial correspondence may support the Post in a few Years at the present rates paid for Letters. In the meanwhile, as we have observed, the post will be a Tax on the Treasury & though we have been attentive as in duty bound to promote the Post, it is equally our duty to express our fears, that the Post may soon be discontinued, unless some attention is had in our State to regulating, both the ferries & the post road. In order to accommodate the large trading Towns it is necessary that the Post should cross the broad ferry at Edenton, we presume that the broad ferries near Bath & New Bern may readily be shuned, by crossing at Washington. The causway at Wilmington is said at present to be absolutely impracticable. We presume that Government will think proper to interfere in this matter and cause the Bridges & roads to be properly repaired. With respect to the expence of ferries, as far as it relates to individuals, it is not our duty to make any remarks; but we hope that the County Courts will enable the Post to Pass at the antient Peace price, and if the Courts have at Present no such power, we flatter  JANUARY 28, 1783  ourselves that the General Assembly will give them such Power; or will take the necessary steps on the subject. For, at a time when Letters are carried & delivered at the antient Peace price; which is the case at present, the public have a right to expect that the Post shall be enabled to travel at the antient Price. It is not safe or just that the Public service should suffer by the arbitrary taxation of individuals. If the post should suffer or should be impeded by the neglect of Government--he doubtless must change his rout or be absolutely discontinued. We have the Honor to be &c, Benjamin Hawkins Hu Williamson ""

Congress exceedingly regret this loss, not only as a valuable character in the Army, possessed of great bravery, perseverance and extraordinary military talents, but as a very important Citizen of the United States. They sincerely condole with your Excellency and the Army on this sorrowful occasion. I am instructed to make this communication to your Excellency by the particular order of Congress, whose sense of the great merit of this Officer, will be best understood by the copy of their resolution for this purpose, which I do myself the honor to enclose.(2) Congress approve of the circumspection with which your Excellency has managed the business relative to Vermont, and hope it will yet be carried into excution, altho' there is great reason to believe, from the circumstances being now known to some of the Eastern States, that it may be prevented.(3) The honorable Gentleman alluded to in the report of Capt.

  Dear Sir Philadelphia Jany 29th. 1783 I observe that the publications in the Boston news papers indicate a speedy peace, and by some letters I have received from thence I find they have made considerable impressions, but I conceive those publications are in some respects made in much stronger terms than advices received will justify, and in consequence thereof the people & perhaps the Government may fall into a secure and lethargic state, which at this time would be peculiarly unhappy and perhaps destructive. Congress by their advices can only determine that the appearances of peace are rather encouraging than otherways, but any person of tolerable information must be sensable that the ministry of Great Britain never will dare, and that the King (if he has the power) never will chuse to accede to the independence of this Country without the approbation of parliament. And how that body would act was such a question submitted to their consideration is I think problematic. If the warr continues another year the distress of Congress must be in the extream their embarresments being now very great. No prospect at present of further foreign loans--and four hundred thousand dollars only being received out of the 8 millions voted for the service of the year 82--and Virginia have sent forward an vote of their assembly purporting that they can pay only two hundred thousand out of the 1300000 dollars which is their proportion of that requisition.  And demands press us on every side, a committe from the army who have received no pay this two years insist upon some imediate payment, as allso a determination relative to the half pay--and that permanent security be given them for the ballance of their present pay. The publick creditors here are violently clamorous for their interest money. And Mr. Morris exceedingly distrest to make good his several engagments. Judge then of our situation which is truly embarresing & will be increasingly so unless that State can be prevaild upon to establish some permanent & adequate funds. JANUARY 29, 1783  Congress have for several days had this subject under their serious consideration what will be the result I know not. It is absolutely necessary that all the States make the utmost exertions to comply with former requisitions, do therefor press upon our State the payment of the first moiety of the Continental tax. Perhaps it will not be best to say much about the conduct of Virginia. Congress do not dispair of bringing them to a more proper sense of their duty & interest both as to the money & impost. I conclude with assuring that I am Your friend & humble Servant. Nath Gorham  [P.S.] Please to make my Compliments to the Hon Mr Russell & your Lady. ""

  My dear friend. Philadelphia Jany. 29th. 1783 I arrivd here but three days since from Virginia (1) when I received your favor of the 21st of Novr. 1782.(2) I do not see by the Journals, that any thing has been done relative to the Mr. Burgess you mention, or that he has petitiond as you apprehend he intended, to be admitted a Citizen of the U.S.(3) If he had, I conceive he woud have done it in vain. I remember that the recommendation not to admit any british Subject whatsoever, was on my motion;(4) therefore you may be satisfyd that I shoud have concurrd with you, in objecting to one so particularly exceptionable as this Petitioner. While you was thus employd in endeavoring to prevent the establishment of a british interest among us; you will not be a little surprized to hear that the following information was given to the House of Delegates in Virginia, & is now on their records, by a Mr. Mercer, & Col. Saml. Griffin stated as the witness to it,\""That it was the public conversation at Philadelphia that there was a british Party on the Continent, at the head of which Messrs Adams, Messrs. Lees & Mr Laurens.\"" Col Griffin being calld before a Committee deposed That he heard this report about two years ago in Boston, & lately in Philadelphia, That it came from Mr. Hancocks Party, which he thought attachd to the french Alliance, the Congress & Genl Washington, because they were most popular and had two thirds of the Assembly on their side, That he had not mentiond Mr. Richard Henry Lee, nor J. Adams, as he did not hear such reports of them. But Mr. S. Adams & his Party, among whom he mentiond Genl. Warren, he thought were Enemies to the french Alliance, because some french frigates, having recapturd a vessel the Owner of which livd at some distance, & the French want- JANUARY 29, 1783  ing the matter judgd immediately, Mr. S. Adams had influence enough with the Assembly to prevent it, The Agent for the French in that affair told him, Mr. S. Adams was an Enemy to the French. Such was the silly evidence in support of as silly a charge, which however not admitting on the sudden of any refutation but what arose from its own absurdity, made an impression on some minds unfavorable to me, & in so doing answerd the purpose for wch. it was intended. Every Engine is at work here to obtain permanent taxes and the appointment of Collectors by Congress, in the States. The terror of a mutinying Army is playd off with considerable efficacy. It is certainly a great misfortune to any Country, that their Army shoud be discontented, & the more so when they have reason on their side, as in the present case. But to remedy temporary evils by permanent Ones is neither wise nor safe. I am persuaded that real inability to pay taxes, is the reason that the States do not furnish their quota, & that peace woud soon enable us to pay the army all their Arrears, and satisfy all our Creditors. A majority of the Army at least, will remember that they are Citizens, & not lend themselves to the tory designs, as I verily believe this is, of subverting the Revolution. Nothing coud be a greater disappointment to me, than not seeing that most excellent Patriot Genl Whipple. My Brother Richard had given me so high an idea of his character, that I respect him as one of the most worthy of our Countrymen. I am much afraid, that peace is not so near as our interest woud make us wish. France & England seem desirous of trying their strength in another campaign. We must not therefore be deluded with pacific appearances here but remember how easy it is for the Enemy to renew offensive operations, shoud their success in other parts permit. The treaty of Amity & Commerce with the States general of the United Netherlands is ratifyd. Our friend Mr. John Adams had great merit in the whole of that business, & the merit is all his own.

  Wednesday Jany. 29th. 1783. Mr. Fitzimmons reminded Congress of the numerous inaccuracies & errors in the American column of the Treaty with Holland (1) and proposed that a revision of it as ratified should take place in order that some steps might be taken for redressing this evil. He added that an accurate comparison of it with the Treaty with France ought also to be made for the purpose of seeing whether it consisted in all its parts with the latter.(2) He desired the Committe who had prepared the ratification to give some explanation on this subject to Congress. Mr. [Madison] as first on that committee informed Congress, that the inaccuracies & errors consisting of mispelling, foreign idioms, & foreign words, obscurity of the sense &c were attended to by the Committee & verbally noted to Congress when their report was under consideration; that the Committee did not report them in writing, as the task was disagreeable, and the faults were not conceived to be of sufficient weight to affect the ratification. He thought it wd. be improper to reconsider the act as had been suggested, for the purpose of suspending it on that or any other acct. but had no objection if Congress were disposed to instruct Mr. A.(3) to substitute with the consent of the other party a more correct counterpart in the American language. The subject was dropped, no body seeming inclined to urge it. On the motion of Mr. Rutlidge & for the purpose of extending the discussion to particular objects of General Revenue Congress resolved itself into a Committee of whole to consider of the most effectual means of restoring public credit; and the proposition relative to gen- JANUARY 29, 1783  eral revenue was referred to the Committee: Mr. Carroll was elected into the chair, & the proposition taken up.(4) Mr. Bland proposed to alter the words of the proposition so as to make it read establisht. of funds \""on taxes or duties, to operate &c.\"" This was agreed to as a more correct phraseology. Mr. Hamilton objected to it at first, supposing thro' mistake that it might exclude the back lands which was a fund in contemplation of some gentlemen. Mr. [Madison] having adverted to the jealousy of Mr. Rutlidge of a latent scheme to fix a tax on land according to its quantity, moved that between the words \""generally\"" & \""to operate\"" might be inserted the words \""and in just proportion.\""  Mr. Wilson said he had no objection to this amendmt. but that it might be referred to the taxes individually, & unnecessarily fetter Congress; since if the taxes collectively sd. operate in just proportion it wd. be sufficient. He instanced a land tax & an impost on trade, the former of which might press hardest on the Southn. & the latter on the Eastn. but both together might distribute the burden pretty uniformly. From this consideration he moved that the words \""on the whole\"" might be prefixed to the words \""in just proportion.\"" This amendt. to the amendment of Mr. [Madison] was 2ded. by Mr. Boudinot & agreed to without opposition as was afterwards the whole amendmt. Mr. Wilson in order to leave the scheme open for the back lands as a fund for paying the public debts, moved that the proposition might be further altered so as to read \""indispensably necessary towards doing complete justice &c.\"" The motion was 2ded. by Mr. Boudinot & passed without opposition. The main proposition then passed without opposition; in the words following.(5)  Mr. Bland proposed as the only expedient that cd. produce immediate relief to the publc Creditors, that, Congress sd. by a fixed resolution appropriate to payment of the interest, all the monies which should arise from the requisitions on the States. He thought this would not only give immediate relief to the Creditors, but by throwing into circulation the stagnant securities, enliven the whole business of taxation. This proposition was not 2ded. Mr. Wilson proceeded to detail to Congress his ideas on the subject of continental revenue.(6) He stated the internal debt liquidated & unliquidated at 21 Million of Dollrs. the foreign debt at 8 Million, the actual deficiency of 1782 at 4 Million, the probable deficiency of 83 at 4 Million. Making in the whole 37 Million; which in round numbers & probably without exceeding the reallity may be called 40 Million. The interest of this debt at 6 per Ct. is 2,400,000 Drs, to which it will be prudent to add 600,000, which if the war continues will be needed, and in case of peace may be applied to a navy. An annual revenue of 3 Million of Drs. then is the sum to be aimed at, and which ought to be under the management of Congs. One of the objects already men-  tioned from wch. this revenue was to be sought, was a poll tax. This he thought a very proper one, but unfortunately the Constitution of Maryland which forbids this tax is an insuperable obstacle. Salt he thought a fit article to be taxed, as it is consumed in a small degree by all and in great quantities by none. It had been found so convenient a subject of taxation, that among all nations which have a system of revenue, it is made a material branch. In England a considerable sum is raised from it. In France it is swelled to the sum of 54,000,000 of livres. He thought it would be improper to levy this tax during the war whilst the price wd. continue so high, but the necessary fall of price at the conclusion of it wd. render the tax less sensible to the people. The suspension of this particular tax during the war would not be inconvenient as it might be set apart for the debt due to France on which the interest would not be called for during the war. He computed the quantity of salt imported into the U. S. annually at 3 Million of Bushels, & proposed a duty of 1/3 of a Dollar per bushel which wd. yield 1,000,000 of Drs. This duty he observed wd. press hardest on the Eastern States on acct. of the extraordinary consumption in the fisheries. The next tax which he suggested was on land. 1 Dollar on every 100 Acres according to the computation of the Superintendt of finance would produce 500,000 Dollrs. This computation he was persuaded might be doubled; since their could not be less than 100 Million of Acres comprehended within the titles of individuals which at 1 Dr. per 100 Acres would yields 1,000,000, of Dollars. This tax cd. not be deemed too high & would bear heaviest not on the industrious farmer, but on the great land-holder. As the tax on Salt would fall with most weight on the Eastern States, the equilibrium would be restored by this which would be most felt by the Middle and Southern States. The impost on trade was another source of revenue which, altho' it might be proper to vary it somewhat to remove particular objections, ought to be again & again urged upon the States by Congress. The office of Finance has rated this at 500,000 Dollars. He thought a peace would double it in which case the sum of 3,000,000 Drs. would be made up. If these computations however should be found to be too high there will still be other objects which would bear taxation. An excise he said had been mentioned. In general this species of taxation was tyrannical & justly obnoxious, but in certain forms had been found consistent with the policy of the freeest States. In Massachussets a State remarkably jealous of its liberty, an excise was not only admitted before but continued since the revolution. The same was the case with Penna. also remarkable for its freedom. An excise if so modified as not to offend the spirit of liberty may be considered as an object of easy & equal revenue. Wine & imported spirits had borne a heavy excise in other Countries, and might be adopted in ours. Coffee is another object which might be included. The amount of these three objects is uncertain but materials for a satisfactory computation might   be procured. These hints & remarks he acknowledged to be extremely imperfect & that he had been led to make them solely by a desire to contribute his mite towards such a system as would place the finances of the U. S. on an honorable & prosperous footing. Mr. Ghorum observed that the proposition of Mr. Bland, however salutary its tendency might be in the respects suggested, could never be admitted because it would leave our army to starve, and all our affairs to stagnate during its immediate operation. He objected to a duty on salt as not only bearing too heavy on the Eastn. States, but as giving a dangerous advantage to Rivals in the fisheries. Salt he sd exported from England for the fisheries is exempted particularly from duties. He thought it would be best to confine our attention for the present to the impost on trade which had been carryed so far towards an accomplishment, and to remove the objections which had retarded it, by limiting the term of its continuance, leaving to the States the nomination of the collectors, and by making the appropriation of it more specific.  Mr. Rutlidge was also for confining our attention to the Impost, & to get that before any further attempts were made. In order to succeed in getting it however he thought it ought to be asked in a new form. Few of the States had complied with the recommendation of Congs. literally. Georgia had not yet complied. Rhode Island had absolutely refused to comply at all. Virga. which at first complied but partially has since rescinded even that partial compliance. After enumerating the several objections urged by the States agst. the scheme, he proposed in order to remove them the following resolution, viz.  \""that it be earnestly recommended to the several States to impose & levy a duty of 5 PerCt. ad valorem at the time & place of importation, on all goods, wares & merchandizes of foreign growth & manufacture, wch. may be imported into the said States respectively, except goods of the U. S. or any of them, and a like duty on all prizes & prize goods condemned in the court of admiralty of said States; that the money arising from such dutys be paid into the continental Treasury, to be appropriated & applied to the payment of the interest and to sink the principal of the money which the U. S. have borrowed in Europe & of what they may borrow, for discharging the arrears due to the army & for the future support of the war & to no other use or purpose whatsoever: that the said duties be continued for 25 years, unless the debts abovemd. be discharged in the meantime, in which case they shall cease & determine, that the money arising from the said duties & paid by any State, be passed to the credit of such State on account of its quota of the debt of the U. States.\"" The motion was seconded by Mr. Lee.  Mr. Woolcot opposed the motion as unjust towards those States which having few or no ports receive their merchandize through the ports of others; repeating the observation that it is the consumer & not the importer who pays the duty. He again animadverted on the   conduct of Virga. in first giving & afterwards withdrawing her assent to the Impost recommended by Congress. Mr. Elseworth thought it wrong to couple any other objects with the Impost: that the States would give this if any thing; and that if a land tax or an excise were combined with it the whole scheme would fail. He thought however that some modification of the plan recommended by Congs. would be necessary. He supposed when the benefits of this continl. revenue should be experienced it would incline the States to concur in making additions to it. He abetted the opposition of Mr. Wolcot to the motion of Mr. Rutlidge which proposed that each State should be credited for the duties collected within its ports; dwelt on the injustice of it, said that Connecticut before the revolution did not import 1/50 perhaps not 1/100 part of the foreign merchandize consumed within it; and pronounced that such a plan wd. never be agreed to. He concurred in the expediency of new-modelling the scheme of the impost by defining the period of its continuance; by leaving to the States the nomination, & to Congress the appointment of Collectors or vice versa; and by a more determinate appropriation of the revenue. The first object to which it ought to be applied was he thought the foreign debt. This object claimed a preference as well from the hope of facilitating further aids from that quarter, as from the disputes into wch. a failure may embroil the U.S. The prejudices agst. making a provision for foreign debts which sd. not include the domestic ones was he thought unjust & might be satisfied by immediately requiring a tax in discharge of which loan-office certificates should be receivable. State funds for the domestic debt would be proper for subsequent consideration. He added as a further objection against crediting the States for the duties on trade respectively collected by them, that a mutual jealousy of injuring their trade by first imposing such a duty would prevent any from making a beginning. Mr. Williamson said that Mr. Rutledge's motion at the same time that it removed some objections, introduced such as would be much more fatal to the measure. He was sensible of the necessity of some alterations, particularly in its duration & the appointment of the Collectors. But the crediting the States severally for the amount of their collections was so palpably unjust & injurious that he thought candor required that it should not be persisted. He was of opinion that the interest of the States, which trade for others, also required it, since such an abuse of the advantage possessed by them would compel the States for which they trade, to overcome the obstacles of nature & provide supplies for themselves. N. Carolina he said would probably be supplied pretty much thro' Virga. if the latter forebore to levy a tax on the former, but in case she did not forbear. the ports of N. C. which are nearly as deep as those of Holland, might & probably wd. be substituted. The profits drawn by the more commercial States from the business they carry on for the others, were of themselves sufficient & ought to satisfy them.  Mr. Ramsay differed entirely from his colleage (Mr Rutlidge). He thought that as the consumer pays the tax, the crediting the States collecting the impost, unjust. N. Carolina, Maryland, N. Jersey & Connecticut would suffer by such a regulation and would never agree to it. Mr. Bland was equally agst. the regulation, he thought it replete with injustice & repugnant to every idea of finance. He observed that this point had been fully canvassed at the time when the impost was originally recommended by Congress, & finally exploded. He was indeed he said opposed to the whole motion (of Mr. Rutlidge) Nothing would be a secure pledge to Creditors that was not placed out of the Controul of the grantors. As long as it was in the power of the States to repeal their grants in this respect, suspicions would prevail, & wd. prevent loans. Money ought to be appropriated by the States as it is by the Parliament of G. B. He proposed that the revenue to be solicited from the States should be irrevocable by them without the consent of Congress, or of nine of the States. He disapproved of any determinate limitation to the continuance of the revenue, because the continuance of the debt could not be fixed and that was the only rule that could be proper or satisfactory. He said he should adhere to these ideas in the face of the act of Virga. repealing her assent to the impost; that it was trifling with Congs. to enable them to contract debts, & to withold from them the means of fulfilling their contracts. Mr. Lee said he seconded the motion of Mr. R. because he thought it most likely to succed; that he was persuaded the States would not concur in the impost on trade without a limitation of time affixed to it. With such a limitation and the right of collection, he thought Virna., R. Island & the other States probably wd. concur. The objection of his Colleague (Mr. Bland) he conceived to be unfounded; No act of the States could be irrevocable, because if so called it might notwithstanding be repealed. But He thought there wd. be no danger of a repeal, observing that the national faith was all the security that was given in other countries, or that could be given. He was sensible that some thing was of necessity to be done in the present alarming crisis; and was willing to strike out the clause crediting the States for their respective collections of the revenue on trade, as it was supposed that it wd. impede the measure. Mr. Hamilton disliked every plan that made but partial provision for the public debts; as an inconsistent & dishonorable departure from the declaration made by Congs. on that subject. He said the domestic Creditors would take the alarm at any distinctions unfavorable to their claims; that they would withhold their influence from any such measures recommended by Congress; and that it must be principally from their influence on their respective legislatures that success could he expected to any applications from Congs. for a general revenue.

  Thursday 30 Jany. [1783] The answer to the Memorials from the Legislature of Penna. was agreed to as it stands on the Journal;(1) N. Jersey alone dissenting. In the course of its discussion several expressions were struck out which seemed to reprehend the States for the deficiency of their contributions. In favor of these expressions it was urged that they were true and ought to be held forth as the cause of the public difficulties in justification of Congress. On the other side it was urged that Congress had in many respects been faulty as well as the States, particularly in letting their finances become so disordered before they began to apply any remedy; and that if this were not the case, it would be more prudent to address to the States a picture of the public distresses & danger, than a Satire on their faults; since the latter would  JANUARY 30, 1783  only irritate them; whereas the former wd. tend to lead them into the measures supposed by Congress to be essential to the public interest. The propriety of mentioning to the Legislature of Penna. the expedt. into which Congress had been driven of drawing bills on Spain & Holland without previous warrant; the disappt. attending it, and the deductions ultimately ensuing from the aids destined to the U. S. by the Ct. of France, was also a subject of discussion. On one side it was represented as a fact which being dishonorable to Congress ought not to be proclaimed by them & that in the present case it cd. answer no purpose. On the other side it was contended that it was already known to all the world, that as a glaring proof of the public embarrassmts. it would impress the Legislature with the danger of making those separate appropriations which wd. increase the embarrassments; and particularly would explain in some degree the cause of the discontinuance of the French interset due on the loan office certificates. Mr. Rutlidge & some other members having expressed less solicitude about satisfying or soothing the Creditors within Pa. through the legislature than others thought ought be felt by every one, Mr. Wilson adverting to it with some war[m]th, declared that if such indifference should prevail, he was little anxious what became of the answer to the Memorials. Pena. he was persuaded would take her own measures without regard to those of Congress, and that she ought to do so. She was willing he said to sink or swim according to the common fate, but that she would not suffer herself with a millstone of 26,000,000 of the continl. debt about her neck to go to the bottom alone.

  Friday Jany. 31. [1783] The instruction to the Va. delegates from that State relative to tobo. exported to N. Y. under passport from Secy. of Congress, as referred to a Committee.(1) Mr Fitzimmons moved that the information recd. from sd. State of its inability to contribute more than (2) towards the requisitions of Congress sd. be also committed. Mr. Bland saw no reason for such committment. Mr. Ghorum was in favr. of it. He thought such a resolution from Va. was of the most serious import; especially if compared with her withdrawal of her assent to the Impost. He said with much earnestness, that if one State should be  JANUARY 31, 1783  connived at in such defaults others would think themselves entitled to a like indulgence. Massts. he was sure had a better title to it than Virga. He said the former had expended immense sums in recruiting her line, which composed almost the whole Northn. Army; that 1,200,000 £ (dollar at 6/.) had been laid out: & that without this sum, the army would have been disbanded. Mr. Fitzimmons abetting the animadversion on Virga. took notice that of Dollars (3) reqd. by Congress from her for the year 1782, she had paid the paltry sum only of 35,000 Drs. and was notwithstanding endeavoring to play off from further contributions. The commitment took place without opposition. The subcommittee consisting of Mr. [Madison], Carroll & Mr. Wilson had this morning a conference with the Superintendt. of Finance on the best mode of estimating the value of land through the U. S.(4) The Superintendent was no less puzzled on the subject than the Committee had been. He thought some essay ought to be made for executing the confederation if it sd. be practicable, & if not to let the impracticability appear to the States. He concurred with the subcommittee also in opinion that it would be improper to refer the valuation to the States, as mutual suspicions of partiality, if not a real partiality, would render the result a source of discontent; and that even if Congs. shd. expressly reserve to themselves a right of revising & rejecting it, such a right could not be exercised without giving extreme offence to the suspected party. To guard agst. these difficulties it was finally agreed, & the sub-committee accordingly reported to the G. Committee,  \""That it is expedient to require of the several States a return of all surveyed & granted land within each of them; and that in such returns the land be distinguished into occupied & unoccupied. \""That it also was expedient to appoint one Commissr. for each State who should be empowered to proceed without loss of time into the several States; & to estimate the value of the lands therein according to the returns abovementioned, & to such instructions as should from time to time be given him for that purpose.\""  This report was hurried into the G. Committee for two reasons: 1st. it was found that Mr. Rutlidge, Mr. Bland & several others relied so much on a valuation of land, and connected it so essentially with measures for restoring public credit that an extreme backwardness on their part affected all these measures, whilst the valuation of land was left out. A 2d. reason was that the subcommittee were afraid that suspicions might arise of intentional delay, in order to confine the attention of Congs. to general funds as affording the only prospect of relief. The Grand Committee for like reasons were equally impatient to make a report to Congress; and accordingly after a short consultation the question was taken whether the above report of the Subcome. or the report (see ) referred to them sd. be preferred. In favor of the 1st were Mr. Wilson, Mr. Carroll, Mr. Madison, Mr. Elmore, Mr.   Hamilton. In favor of the 2d were Mr. Arnold, Mr. Dyer, Mr. Hawkins, Mr. Ghorum, Mr. Rutlidge & Mr. Gilman: So the latter was immediately handed in to Congress, & referred to the Committee of the whole into which they immediately resolved themselves.(5) A motion was made by Mr. Bland 2ded. by Mr. M[adison] that this report sd. be taken up in preference to the subject of general funds. Mr. Wilson opposed it as irregular & inconvenient to break in an unfinished subject; and supposed that as some further experiment must be intended than merely a discussion of the subject in Congress, before the subject of Genl. funds would be seriously resumed, he thought it unadvisable to interrupt the latter. Mr. [Madison] answered that the object was not to retard the latter business but to remove an obstacle to it, that as the two subjects were in some degree connected as means of restoring public credit, & inseparably connected in the minds of many members, it was but reasonable to admit one as well as the other to a share of attention: that if a valuation of land sd. be found on mature deliberation to be as efficacious a remedy as was by some supposed, it wd. be proper at least to combine it with the other expedient, or perhaps to substitute it altogether: if the contrary should become apparent, its patrons wd. join the more cordially in the object of a general revenue. Mr. Hamilton concurred in these ideas & wished the valuation of land to be taken up in order that its impracticabil[it]y & futility might become manifest. The motion passed in the affirmative, & the report was taken up. The phraseology made more correct in several instances. A motion was made by Mr. Boudinot 2ded. by Mr. Elseworth to strike out the clause requiring a return of the \""names of the owners,\"" as well as the quantity of land. Mr. Elseworth also contended for a less specific return of the parcels of land. The objection agst. the clause were that it would be extremely troublesome & equally useless. Mr. Bland thought these specific returns wd. be a check on frauds & the suspicion of them. Mr. Williamson was of the same opinion, as were also Mr. Lee, Mr. Ghorum, & Mr. Ramsay.(6) The motion was withdrawn by Mr. Boudinot. ""

  Teusday Feby. 4 [1783].  An indecent & tart remonstrance was rcd. from Vermont agst. the interposition of Congs. in favor of the persons who had been banished & whose effects had been confiscated.(1) A motion was made by Mr. Hamilton 2ded. by Mr. Dyer to commit it. Mr. Wolcot who had always patronized the case of Vermont wished to know the views of a committment. Mr. H. said his view was to fulfill the resolution of Congress wch. bound them to enforce the measure. Mr. Dyer sd. his was that so dishonorable a menace might be as quickly as possible renounced. He said Genl. Washington was in favor of Vermont,(2) that the principal people of N. England were all supporters of them, and that Congress ought to rectify the error into which they had been led, without longer exposing themselves to reproach on this subject. It was committed without dissent.(3) Mr. Wilson informed Congress that the Legislature of Pena. having found the Ordinance of Congs, erecting a Court for piracies so obscure in some points that they were at a loss to adapt their laws to it, had appointed a Come. to confer with a Come. of Congress. He accordingly moved in behalf of the Pa. delegation that a Come. might be appd. for that purpose. After some objections by Mr. Madison agst. the impropriety of holding a communication with Pa. through Committees when the purpose might be as well answered by a Memorial, or an instruction to its Delegates, a Come. was appd. consisting of Mr. Rutlidge, Mr. [Madison] & Mr. Wilson.(4)  The Report proposing a commutation for the half pay due to the army, was taken up.(5) On a motion to allow 51/2 years whole pay in gross to be funded & bear interest, this being the rate taken from Price's calculation of annuities.(6) N. H. was no, R. I. no, Cont. no, N. J. no, Mr. Lee of Va. no(7)--other States ay, So the question was lost. 5 years was then proposed, on which N. H. was no, R. I. no, Ct. no, N. J. no, so there were but 6 ays & the proposition was lost. Mr. Williamson proposed 51/4 & called for the yeas & nays. Messrs. Wolcot & Dyer observed that they were bound by instructions on this subject. Mr. Arnold said the case was the same with him. They also queried the validity of the act of Congs, which had stipulated half pay to the army, as it had passed before the Confederation, and by a vote of less than seven States. Mr. [Madison] sd. that he wished if the yeas & nays were called it might be  FEBRUARY 4, 1783  on the true calculation, and not on an arbitrary principle of compromise, as the latter standing singly on the journal wd. not express the true ideas of the yeas, and might even subject them to contrary interpretations. He sd. that the act was valid because it was decided according to the rule then in force, & that as the officers had served under the faith of it, justice fully corroborated it; & that He was astonished to hear these principles controverted. He was also astonished to hear objections agst. a commutation come from States in compliance with whose objections agst. the half pay itself, this expedt. had been substituted. Mr. Wilson expressed his surprise also that instructions sd. be given which militated agst. the most peremtory & lawful engagements of Congs. and said that if such a doctrine prevailed the authority of the Confederacy was at an end. Mr. Arnold said that he wished the report might not be decided on at this time, that the assembly of R. I. was in session, & he hoped to receive their further advice. Mr. Bland enforced the ideas of Mr. [Madison] & Mr. Wilson. Mr. Gilman thought it wd. be best to refer the subject of 1/2 pay to the several States to be settled between them & their respective lines. By general consent the Report lay over. Mr. Lee communicated to Congress a letter he had received from Mr. Samuel Adams dated Boston Decr. 22, 1782, introducing Mr. from Canada,(8) as a person capable of giving intelligence relative to affairs in Canada & the practicability of uniting that province with the Confederated States. The letter was committed. In Come. of the whole on the Report concerning a valuation of the lands of the U States.(9)  A motion was made by Mr. Rutlidge wch. took the sense of Congs. on this question whether the rule of apportionment to be grounded on the proposed valuation sd. continue in force untill revoked by Congs. or a period be now fixed beyond which it sd. not continue in force. The importance of the distinction lay in the necessity of having seven votes in every act of Congs. The Eastern States were generally for the latter, supposing that the Southern States being impoverished by the recent havoc of the enemy would be underrated in the first valuation. The Southern States were for the same reason interested in favor of the former: on the question there were 6 ays only, which produced a dispute whether in a committee of the whole a majority wd. decide, or whether 7 votes were necessary. In favor of the first rule it was contended by Mr. Ghorum & others, that in Committees of Congress, the rule always is that a majority decides. In favr. of the latter it was contended that if the rule of other com- mittees applies to a come. of the whole the vote sd. be individual per capita as well as by a majority, that in other deliberative assemblies, the rules of voting were not varied in Committees of the whole, and that it wd. be inconvenient in practice to report to Congs as the sense of the body a measure approved by 4 or 5 States, since there could be no   reason to hope that in the same body in a different form, 7 States wd. approve it, and consequently a waste of time would be result.(10) Come. rose & Cons.

  My dear Sir Philada. Feby. 4th. 1783  By a letter recd. from Col. Monroe by Mr. Jones I find that my conjectures as to the cause of your silence by the last post were but too true. To the same cause probably I am to impute your silence by yesterday's mail.(1)  The subject which my last left under the consideration of Congress has employed the chief part of the week. The generality of the members are convinced of the necessity of a continental revenue for an honorable discharge of the continental engagements, & for making future provision for the war. The extent of the plan however compared with the prepossessions of their constituents produces {despondence}(2) & {timidity}. It appears that the annual revenue which prudence calls for the objects abovementioned, amounts to the {enormous sum of three million of dollars}. You will ask perhaps from what sources this revenue could be drawn if the States were willing to establish it? Congress have done nothing as yet from which the answer they wd. dictate can be inferred. By individuals on the floor, the {impost, a land tax, poll tax, a tax on salt, a} &c. have been suggested, and some computation of their productiveness has made them competent to the object. The valuation of the land accordg to the Articles of Confederation is also before Congress & by some considered as a great step towards obtaining the necessary revenue. If you ask by what operation? I shall be the more incapable of answering it than the preceding question. The repeal of the impost by Virga. is still {unriddled. Dr. Lee says} that {he was} the {only man who opposed} the {torrent} from which it is the more suspected that there has been {some manOEuuvre in the transaction}: Mr. {Jones quotes} the instance of {your last election to Congress}. I find a great check to secret communications from the defects of your cypher. It in the first place is so scanty as to be extremely tedious, and in the next both the letters & figures are in so ambiguous a character that great caution is necessary to avoid errors. I wish we could somehow or other substitute a more convenient one.(3)  I recd. a letter yesterday from Mr. Jefferson at Baltimore. It is dated the 31st of Jany.(4) and he calculated on sailing in about three days. The industry of the British Ships on the coast may notwithstanding render it necessary to wait longer.

  Sir, Philadelphia February 4th. 1783. Since the departure of Mr. Howell Congress have been principally employed in attending to Complaints contained in a Memorial from the Officers & Army, and devising means for their relief and satisfaction; And in investigating means to restore Public Credit--by satisfying the demands of the Public Creditors--the importunities of both having become very urgent. Upon the first the Committee have reported That such payment as the State of the FOEderal Treasury will admit shall be immediately made which is agreed to. They further reported That the Arrears of Pay &c, should be adjusted & settled and Public securities bearing the Interest of Six per Cent--Issued for the payment of the Balances due. That the Officers should be at Liberty to commute, for half pay by the amount of a Certain term of years whole pay--for which they shall recieve Certificates--on Interest payable Annually. These propositions have had several partial discussions but are yet undetermined. With respect to half pay our Instructions bind our votes, and as the proposed commutation is a change in form & in name, rather than in nature & substance we shall oppose it. A proposition is intended to be made for referring the Officers to their respective States for Compensation, in such manner as they shall think fit--and agree to with them--and whereby they will be at Liberty to consider the length of services, and particular Merits of each--but this we have no hopes will succeed at present. This is an Affair which greatly embarrasses Congress. The Officers, consider their resolution as a solemn contract, and declare a faithful & painful performance on their part. The advocates for complying with their demands, urge in addition thereto That that resolution passed--at a most critical juncture when it was the only expedient, left to prevent the dissolution of the Army--That the National faith has been committed--past recall---That an attempt to abridge them in their expectations, would not only be dishonorable but, dangerous &c &c. FEBRUARY 4, 1783  When any thing is offered against the principle and the sense of the Legislature & people of Rhode Island declared--We are extremely mortified to be told That the State is foreclosed from any opposition at this day. That their Consent has been once given fully & absolutely in favor of Half Pay--and that it is too late now to make objections--or declare what are the present Opinions of the State--on the subject--and the Journals of Congress produced to show that General Cornell, had committed the State--by giving their vote in favor of that Measure--&c &c &c. We shall however continue on the ground our Instructions place us, unless different advice and direction should render a change necessary.(1) The Mode for obtaining a general estimate throughout the States--now an object of great attention--and considered as a preparatory step to the means of restoring public Credit--has been under Consideration of a Grand Committee who reported to Congress, afterwards the House formed itself into a Committee of the whole, and Several days have been spent thereon but it is not yet Completed--in our next We hope to be able to inclose the result. These matters ended--it is expected the Propositions for an Impost will be again renewed. From the variety of Opinions which have lately been thrown out on that subject--it is presumed it will make its appearance in a form & upon principles materially different from the former recommendation on that subject. The treaty of Amity, Commerce &c between the United States & United Netherlands, contained in the paper herewith inclosed has been ratified by Congress, and Copies duly Authenticated, sent off to be exchanged.

Court have thought proper to allow several of my Colleagues  FEBRUARY 5, 1783  that have returned since, and asked your attention to the same; and I have been informed that thro' the multiplicity of business that was then before the Court it was not determined upon, and fearing the same reasons may still operate against me, may I be permited to renew my request, & urge the same reasons I then mention'd.(2)  I have the Honor to be, with the highest sentiments of respect, your most obedient servant.

  Wednesday Feby. 5. & Thursday Feby 6, 1783. In order to decide the rule of voting in a Come. of the whole,(1) before Congss. should go into the said Come. Mr. Bland moved that the rule sd. be to vote by States, the majority of States in Come. to decide. Mr. Wilson moved to postpone Mr. B's motion in order to resolve that the rule be, to vote by States and according to the same rules which govern Congress; as this genel. question was connected with the particular question to which it was to be immediately applied, the motion for postponing was negatived, Chiefly by the Eastern States. A division of the question on Mr. Bland's motion was then called for & the first part was agreed to as on the Journal. The latter clause, to wit, a majority to decide, was negatived; so nothing as to the main point was determined. In this uncertainty Mr. Osgood proposed that Congs. sd. resolve itself into a Come. of the whole. Mr. Carrol as chairman observed that as the same difficulty would occur, he wished Congs. would previously direct him how to proceed. Mr. Hamilton propd that the latter clause of Mr. Bland's motion shd. be reconsidered and agreed to wrong as it was, rather than have no rule at all. In opposition to which it was sd. that there was no more reason why one & that not the minor side sd. wholly yield to the inflexility of the other than vice, versa, and that if they sd. be willing to yield on the present occasion, it wd. be better to do it tacitly, than to saddle themselves with an  FEBRUARY 5, 1783  express & perpetual rule which they judged improper. This expedient was assented to, and Congress accordingly went into A Committee of the whole The points arising on the several amendts. proposed were 1st. the period beyond wch. the rule of the first valuation sd. not be in force.(2) On this point Mr. Collins proposed 5 years, Mr. Bland 10 years, Mr. Boudinot 7 years, N. Jersey havg instructed her Delegates thereon.(3) The Cont. delegates proposed 3 years--on the question for 3 years, N. H. no, Mas: no. R. I. ay, Cont. ay. all the other States no. On the question for 5 years, all the States ay except Cont.(4) The 2d. point was whether & how far the rule sd. be retrospective. on this point the same views operated as on the preceeding. Some were agst. any retrospection, others, for extending it to the whole debt, and others, for extendg it so far as was necessary for liquidating and closing the accounts between the United States and each individual State.(5) The several motions expressive of these different ideas were at length withdrawn, with a view that the point might be better digested, & more accurately brought before Congress. So the rept. was agreed to in the Come. & made to Congress. When the question was about to be put Mr [Madison] observed that the report lay in a great degree of confusion, that several points had been decided in a way too vague & indirect to ascertain the real sense of Congs. that other points involved in the subject had not recd. any decision; and proposed the sense of Congs. shod. be distinctly & successively taken on all of them & the result referred to a Special Come. to be digested &c. The question was however put & agreed,(6) the votes as they appear on the Journal. The reasons on which Mr. Hamiltons motion was grounded appear from the preamble. ""

  Sir Philadelphia Febry 5 1783 Recd your favor of 23 Decr. Among other things you press hard that the Affair of Vermont may be settled. It has been taken up in Congress often since I have been here, but the different Opinion of members has prevented any determination. The southern members are greatly opposed to their Independence, and there are not a Sufficient number of the States that are for subjugating them to N. York or N. Hampshire, and even if it was Resolved in Congress to bring them under either of said states, or divide them between both, I am of opinion it Could not be Carried into execution. Yesterday was recd. in Congress, a long remonstrance from Thomas Chittenden Esqr.,(1) against the proceedings of Congress which passed some time since, requiring the Inhabitants of said Territory to restore Certain persons who they had Banished. He therein mentions the resolve of Congress wherein they were to Cast off the two wings & then [be] received into union, inserted also a copy of a Letter written by General Washington recommending the measure, & intimating that there would be no difficulty of being received after that was done. Note--the General wrote said letter (as is said) by desire of several members of Congress. Mr. Chittenden fears not the Army it seems, by the drift of his letter, & wonders that Congress should meddle with the affairs of their state--they are willing to dispute the affair with N. York--he says that it has been an Independent State a number of years, but on the whole is willing to enter into union with the thirteen States. We have nothing new from Europe but are in expectation of Something soon. I have heard the fate that the plan of government met with, by often sifting I hope the vile part will be done away. Religious disputes none here, each one worships where he pleases & there are many denominations & places of worship. I will not trouble you with more but Subscribe myself your most humle.

  Friday Feby. 7 [1783]. On motion of Mr. Lee who had been absent when the Report was yesterday negatived, the matter was reconsidered.(1) The plan of takg the sense of Congs. on the several points as yesterday proposed by [Mr. Madison] was generally admitted as proper. The first question propd. in Come. of whole by [Mr Madison] was; Q: Shall a valuation of land within the U. S. as directed by the articles  FEBRUARY 7, 1783  of confederation be immediately attempted? 8 ays--N. Y. only no. The States present, N. H., Mas., Cont., N. Y., N. J., Pa., Va., N. C., S. C. R. I. 1 member, Maryd. 1 do. By Mr. Wilson  Q: Shall each State be called on to return to the U. S. in Congs. assd. the no. of acres granted to or surveyed for any person, and also the no. of buildings within it? 8 ayes--N. C. no--supposing this not to accord with the plan of referring the valuation to the States, which was patronized by that delegation, a supplement to this question was suggested as follows. Q: Shall the male inhabitants be also returned, the blacks & whites being therein distinguished? Ay. N. C. no for same reason. Cont. divided. By Mr. M[adison].  Q: Shall the States be called on to return to Congs. an estimate of the value of its lands with the buildings & improvements within each respectively? After some discussion on this point in wch the inequalities which wd. result from such estimates were set forth at large; and effects of such an experiments in Virga. had been described by Mr. Mercer, and a comparison of an average valuation in Pa. & Va. which amounted in the latter to 50 PerCt. more than in the former, altho' the real value of land in the former was confessedly thrice that of the latter had been quoted by [Mr. Madison] the apprehensions from a referrence of any thing more to the States than a report of simple facts increased, and on the vote the States were as follows, N.H., Mas., N.J., Pa., Va., no: Mr. Bland ay. Mr. Lee silent. Cont., N.C., S.C., ay. N.Y. divd. So it passed in the negative. Q: by Mr. [Madison], shall a period be now fixed beyond which the rule to be eventually estabd. by Congs. shall not be in force? Ay, unanimously. By Mr. [Madison] Q: What shall that period be? Cont. was again for 3. years, which being negd. 5 yrs passed unanimously. Q: by Mr. M[adison] shall the rule so to be estabd. have retrospective operation so far as may be necessary for liquidating & closing the accts. between the U.S. & each particular State? Ay--Cont. no. Mr. Dyer & Mr. Mercer understood this as making the amt. of the several requisitions and not of the paymts, the standard by which the accts. were to be liquidated and thought the latter the just quantum for retrospective apportionment. Their reasoning however was not fully comprehended. ""

  Monday Feby. 10 [1783]. The Report of the Committee on the Resolutions of Va. concerning the contract Under which Tobo. was to be exported to N. Y. and the admission of circumstancial proof of accounts agst. U. S. when legal vouchers had been destroyed by the enemy.(1) Mr. Mercer informed Congress that this matter had made much noise in Va. that she had assented to the export of the first quantity, merely out of respect to Congs. and under an idea that her rights of Sovereignty had been encroached upon; and that as a further quantity had been exported without the licence of the State, the question was unavoidable, whether the authority of Congs. extended to the act. He wished therefore that Congress wd. proceed to decide this question.  Mr. Fitzimmons in behalf of the Committee observed that they went no farther than to examine whether the proceedings of the officers of Congs. were conformable to the Resols. of Congs. & not whether the latter were within the power of Congs. FEBRUARY 10, 1783  Mr. Lee. sd. the Rept. did not touch the point that, the additional quantity had been exported without application to the State, altho' the first quantity was licenced by the State with great reluctance, in consequence of the request of Congs. and of assurances agst. a repetition, and that the Superintendt & Secy. of Congs. ought at any rate to have made application to the Executive before they proceeded to further exportations. Mr. Rutlidge sd. the Rept. went to the very point, that Va. suspected the Resols. of Congs. had been abused by the Officers of Congs. & the Rept. shewed that no such abuse had taken place; that if this information was not satisfactory, and the State sd. contest the right of Congs. in the case, it wd. then he proper to answer it on that point, but not before; He sd. if the Gentleman (Mr. Lee) meant that the Come. authorised by Congs. on the day of (2) to make explanations on this subject to the Legislature of Va. had given the assurances he mentioned, he must be mistaken: for none such had been given. He had he sd. formed notes of his remarks to the Legl. but accordg to his practice had destroyed them after the occasion was over, and therefore cd. only assert this from memory, that nevertheless his memory enabled him to do it with certainty.  Mr. Lee, in explanation sd. he did not mean the Come. that the abuse complained of was not that the Resolun. of Congs. had been exceeded, but that the export had been undertaken without the Sanction of the State. If the acts were repeated, he said, great offence wd. be given to Va. The report was agd. to as far as the Tobo. was concerned without a dissenting voice. Mr. Lee uttering a no, but not loud enough to be heard by Congress or the chair. The part relating to the loss of Vouchers, was unanimously agd. to.(3) Come. of the Whole. The Rept. for valuation of land amended by insertion of \""distinguishing dwelling houses from others.\""(4) The Come. adjourned & the report was made to Congs.(5) Mr. Lee & Mr. Jarvais moved that the report might be postponed to adopt another plan to wit \""to call on the States to return a valuation: and to provide that in case any return sd. be not satisfactory to all parties, persons sd. be appd. by Congs. & others by the States respectively to adjust the case finally.[\""] On this question N.

  Dear Sir Philada. Feby. 11th. 1783  Your favor of the 31 of Jany. was safely brought by Mr. Thomson. That of the 7 inst. came by yesterday's mail.(1) The anecdote related in the first was new to me; and if there were no other key, would sufficiently decypher the implacability of the party triumphed over. In answer to the second I can only say at this time that I feel deeply for your situation: that I approve of the choice you have made among its difficulties, and that every aid which can depend on me shall be exerted to relieve you from them. Before I can take any step with propriety however it will [be] expedient to feel the sentiments of Congress, and to advise with some of my friends. The first point may possibly be brought about by your letter to the Secy. of F. A. which I suppose came too late yesterday to be laid before Congress, but which will no doubt be handed in this morning.(2) The time of Congress since you left us has been almost exclusively spent on projects for a valuation of the land, as the fOEderal articles require, and yet I do not find that we have got an inch forward towards the object. The mode of referring the task to the States which  FEBRUARY 11, 1783  had at first the warmest & most numerous support seems to be in a manner abandoned; and nothing determinate is yet offered on the mode of effecting it without their intervention. The greatest misfortune perhaps attending the case is that a plan of some kind is made an indispensable preliminary to any other essay for the public relief. I much question whether a sufficient number of States will be found in favor of any plan that can be devised, as I am sure that in the present temper of Congs. a sufficient number cannot Who will agree to tell their Constituents that the law cannot be executed, and to propose an amendment of it. {Congress yesterday received}(3) from {Mr. Adams several letters dated September}(4) not remarkable for any thing unless it be a full {display} of {his vanity, his prejudice against} the {French Court} & {his venom against Doctr. Franklin.} Other preparations for the post do not allow me to use more cypher at present. I have a letter from Randolph dated Feby. 1 confirming the death of his aunt.(5) You are acquainted no doubt with the course the estate is to take. He seems disposed in case he can make a tolerable compromise with his Father's creditors to resign his appt. under the State & go into the Legislature. His zeal for some continental arrangemt. as essential for the public honor & saftety forms at least one of his motives, & I have added all the fuel to it in my power. My neglect to write to you heretofore has proceeded from a hope that a letter wd. not find you at Baltimore; and no subject has occurred for one of sufft. importance to follow you. You shall henceforward hear from me as often as an occasion presents, until your departure forbids it. The Ladies & Gentlemen to whom I communicated your respects, return them with equal sincerity & the former as well as myself very affectionately include Miss Patsy in the object of them.

Indeed I think it is a duty to which you owe some sacrifices, greater than I sd. suppose the difference between the profits of your office, & those from which it excludes you, can amount to. Of this difference you are the best judge; but in my position I undertake to say, your view of our affairs would furnish still more cogent motives than those you now feel. The valuation of the lands of the U.S. as directed by the articles of Union has employed & puzzled Congress for the past week; and after all the projects & discussions which have taken place, we seem only to have gone round in a circle to the point at which we set out. The only point on which Congress are generally agreed is that something ought to be attempted; but what that something ought to be, is a theorem not solved alike by scarcely any two members: and yet a solution of it seems to be made an indispensible preliminary to other essays for the public relief. The Deputation from the army is waiting the upshot of all these delays & dilemmas. When I mentioned to you the subject of your conversation with Dr. McC[l]urg, (2) I ought to have added that one reason which influenced the resig____n of ______(3) was an expence experienced of 3 thousand dollrs. beyond the salary. I wish this circumstance not to be withheld as it must be material in the case, and it would be a real affliction to me to be accessary to a disappointment. For the same reason it is incumbent on me to observe that I hold it to be very uncertain whether [the] place in question will be within the option of our friend, as I hold indeed the continuance of the place itself to be a little precarious.  Mr. J. is detained at Baltimore by the danger wch besets the Capes. This situation he writes me is far from being a pleasant one and yet I fear the avidity and vigilance of the Enemy will prevent his being quickly relieved from it. Mr. Mercer filled up the remaining blank in the Delegation on Wednesday last.(4)  This City is full of reports concerning peace, but they all come by the way of the W.I. and are the more uncertain as they come too thro' mercantile channels. The fall of goods which is taking place augurs well however.  FEBRUARY 11, 1783  ""

  Sir, Philadelphia Feby. 11 1783  We beg leave to acquaint your Excellency that the delegates of Massachusetts agreeable to their instructions, again call'd the attention of Congress to the subject of the old paper money--in consiquence of which a Committe was appointed for the consideration thereof who reported that it should be redeam'd from the possesers by giving continental securities on interest for the amount, the Committe in their report leaving the rate at which the redemption should be made a blank. When the report was under the consideration of Congress a motion was made to fill the blank with the word forty which pass'd in the negative.(1) Another motion was then made that the blank be fill'd by inserting the words seventy five which allso pass'd in the negative. The report still lays before Congress to be taken up when calld for, but the deficiencies of all the States in the payment of their quota of the eight millions of dollars required for the service of the year seventeen hundred and eighty two as will appear (2) are such as to occasion dificulties allmost insuperable in all the great departments; which with the pressing demands of the publick creditors has so embarrased Congress that their whole attention is necessaryly turn'd to provide for the immediate exigencies of Government, and to the means necessary for the restoration of publick credit. Whenever Congress shall come to such resolutions upon those great questions, as that their attention to them can with safety to the general welfare be dispenced with, we shall again bring into view the affair of the old money and will as early as possible inform our constituents of the resolutions that may be pass'd upon this business, or upon any of those important objects now under consideration. We have only to add our request Sir that you will make to the Court the communication of the subject matter of this letter (3)--and that we are with all due consideration & respect to the Hone.

Can Assure you I have not been inattentive to your cause tho I have had many other Objects of Consequence to attend to, I heretofore Informed you (1) that I had procured an Engagement of a Court of Appeals to be held on the 8th of Novembr., there were then but (2) Judges one present at Philadelphia the other viz Mr Paca belonged to Mary-land. He agreed to the time of the Court & Engaged to attend at that time, to which Notice was given Genll Varnum came from Providence & made that long Journey on purpose but Alas Mr Paca was in Nomination for governor of Mary-Land, Election was drawing near, and he never came, and all was frustrated for that time. Then I procured the Court adjourned to sometime in January. Before that time Mr Paca resigned & Mr Lowel of Boston and a Mr Reed of Delaware State appointed. It was some time before Congress could be Ascertaind of their Acceptance, but we have no expectation Mr Lowell will make a Journey to Philadelphia. I early applied to Judge Griffin to write to Mr. Reed who lives but about 40 miles from this place & to adjourn the Court forward to a time at which he might hope Mr Reed would attend, but as yet hear Nothing from Mr Reed, I am Constantly applying to Judge Griffin on the Subject he has been always attentive to the business, I am pressing the matter, the necessity of a Tryal soon, as the Court at Rhodisland have notwithstanding Notice of a New Trial, persisted to give Judgment on the Bond, which Judgment they mean to persue. He has now engaged me himself to goe down, to Delaware State in a few days see Mr Reed himself & urge his attendance at least by the beginning of April, as I hope to set out for home sometime in that month, & every thing in that Court is so dilatory that I fear if I cannot succeed with all my Importunity, that if I leave it, it never will be done, I shall persue, & persue, to my Utmost. Mr Wharton to whom you referr me is now at Baltimore, expect his return in a few days when shall apply for the £20.0.0 as I am in want enough, my tarry has been here so long, expences so great, the Supply from the State so small, that I fear I shall not be able with all to Clear out in the Spring.

  Wednesday Feby. 12 [1783]. The declaration of Congs. as to Genl. Funds passed on January 29 appears on the Journals;(1) and Congress resolved itself into a Come. of the whole in order to consider the funds to be adopted & recommended to the States. On motion of Mr. Mifflin the impost of 5 PerCt. was taken into consideration. As it seemed to be the general opinion that some variations from the form in which it had been first recommended, wd. be necessary for reconciling the objecting States to it, it was proposed that the sense of the Come. should be taken on that head. The following questions were accordingly propounded:  Qu. 1. Is it expedient to alter the impost as recomme[n]ded on the day of 1781? (2)  Mr. Lee said the States particularly Virga. wd. never concur in the measure unless the term of years were limited, the collection left to the States, & the appropriation annually laid before them. Mr. Wolcot thought the revenue ought to be commensurate in point of time as well as amount to the debt; that there was no danger in trusting Congs. considering the responsible mode of its appt. and that to alter the plan wd. be a mere condescension to the prejudices of the States.  Mr. Ghorum favored the alteration for the same reason as Mr. Lee, He said private letters informed him that the opposition to the impost law was gaining ground in Mas. and the repeal of Virga. would be very likely to give that opposition an ascendance. He said our measures must be accomodated to the sentiments of the States whether just or unreasonable.  Mr. Hamilton dissented from the particular alterations suggested, but did not mean to negative the question. Mr. Bland was for conforming to the ideas of the States as far as wd. in any manner consist with the object. On the Question the affirmative was unanimous excepting the voice of Mr. Wolcot. Qu. 2d. Shall the term of duration be limited to 25 years?  Mr. Mercer professed a decided opposition to the principle of general revenue, observed that the liberties of Engd. had been preserved by a separation of the purse from the sword, that untill the debts sd. be liquidated & apportioned he never wd. assent in Congs. or elsewhere to the scheme of the Impost.  Mr. Bland proposed an alternative of 25 years, or until the requisitions of Congs. according to the Articles of Confedn. shall be found adequate. On this proposition The votes were of N. H. divd., R. I. no., Cont. no, N. Y. no, N. J no, Pa. no, Virga. ay, N. C. divd., S. C. ay.  On the main question for 25 years, it was voted in the affirmative. FEBRUARY 12, 1783  Q. 3.

  Sir Philadelphia, Feby. [13](1) 1783 Flattering myself that your knowlege of me will induce you to receive the observations I make as dictated by a regard to the public  FEBRUARY 13, 1783  good, I take the liberty to suggest to you my ideas on some matters of delicacy and importance. I view the present juncture as a very interesting one. I need not observe how far the temper and situation of the army make it so. The state of our finances was perhaps never more critical. I am under injunctions which will not permit me to disclo[se] some facts, that would at once demonstrate this posi[tion] but I think it probable you will be possessed of the[m] through another channel. It is however certain that there has scarcely been a period of the revolution which called more for wisdom and decision in Congress. Unf[or]tunately for us we are a body not governed by reason [or] foresight, but by circumstances. It is probable we shall [not] take the proper measures; and if we do not a few [months] may open an embarrassing scene. This will be the ca[se] whether we have peace or a continuance of the war. If the war continues, it would seem th[at] the army must in June subsist itself to defend the [country;] if peace should take place it will subsist itself to pr[ocure] justice to itself. It appears to be a prevailing opini[on in] the army that the disposition to recompence their s[ervices] will cease with the necessity for them: and that if they [once] lay down their arms, they part with the means of ob[taining] justice. It is to be lamented that appearances aff[ord] too much ground for their distrust. It becomes a serious inquiry what is the true line of policy? The claims of the army urged with moderation, but with firmness, may operate on those weak minds which are influenced by their apprehensions more than by their judgments, so as to produce a concurrence in the measures which the exigencies of affairs demand. They may add weight to the applications of Congress to the several states. So far an useful turn may be given to them. But the difficulty will be to keep a complaining and suffering army within the bounds of moderation. This Your Excellency's influence must effect. In order to it, it will be adviseable not to discountenance their endeavours to procure redress, but rather by the intervention of confidential and prudent persons to take the direction of them. This however must not appear: it is of moment to the public tranquillity, that Your Excellency should preserve the confidence of the army without losing that of the people. This will enable you in case of extremity to guide the torrent, and to bring order, perhaps even good, out of confusion. ' Tis a part that requires address; but ' tis one, which your own situation as well as the welfare of the community points out. I will not conceal from Your Excellency a truth which it is necessary you should know. An idea is propagated in the army that delicacy carried to an extreme prevents your espousing its interests with sufficient warmth. The falsehood of this opinion no one can be better acquainted with than myself, but it is not the less mischievous for being false. Its tendency is to impair that influence, which you may   exert with advantage, should any commotions unhappily ensue, to moderate the pretensions of the army and make their conduct correspond with their duty. The great desideratum at present is the establishment of general funds, which alone can do justice to the Creditors of the United States (of whom the army forms the most meritorious class), restore public credit and supply the future wants of government. This is the object of all men of sense; in this the influence of the army, properly directed, may cooperate. The intimations I have thrown out will suffice to give Your Excellency a proper conception of my sentiments. You will judge of their reasonableness or fallacy; but I persuade myself you will do justice to my motives. I have the honor to be, With great respect, Your Excellency's Most Obedt servt. Alex Hamilton [P.S.] General Knox has the confidence of the army & is a man of sense. I think he may be safely made use of.

  Thursday Feby. 13th [1783]. The Grand Come. report to Congs. the alterations yesterday agreed on with respect to the 5 PerCt. Impost.(1) The deputy Secy. at War reported to Congress the result of the enquiry directed by them on the day of (2) into the siezure of goods destined for the British Prisoners of war under passport from Genl Washington. From this report it appeared that some of the Siezors had pursued their claim under the law of the State & that in consequence the goods had been condemned & ordered for sale. The papers were referred to a Come consisting of Mr. Rutledge, Mr. Ghorum & Mr. Lee, who after havg. retired for a few moments reported, that the Secy at War should be authorised & directed to cause the goods to be taken from the places where they had been deposited, to employ such force as wd. be sufficient, and that the Duke de Lauz[un] whose Legion was in the neighborhood, should be requested to give the Secy. such aid as he might apply for.(3) This report was generally regarded by Congs. as intemperate, and the proposed recourse to the French Legion as flagrantly imprudent. Mr. Hamilton said that if the object had been to embroil this Country wth. their allies the expedient would have been well conceived.(4) He  FEBRUARY 13, 1783  added that the exertion of force would not under these circumstances meet the sense of the people at large. Mr. Ghorum sd. he denied this with respect to the people of Massachussetts. Mr. Lee on the part of the Come. said that the D. de Lauzun had been recurred [to] as being in the neighbourhood & having Cavalry under his Command which would best answer the occasion; and that the report was founded on wise & proper considerations. Mr. Mercer, Mr. Williamson, Mr. Ramsay & Mr. Wilson & Mr [Madison] strenuously opposed the Report, as improper altogether as far it related to the French Legion, and in other respects so until the State of Pa. sd. on a summons refuse to restore the articles seized. Mr. Rutledge with equal warmth contends for the expediency of the measures reported. Mr. Mercer & Mr. M[adison] at length proposed that Congress sd. assert the right on this subject & summon the State of Pena. to redress the wrong immediately.(5) The Report was recommitted, with this proposition & Mr. Wilson & Mr. Mercer added to the Come. The Speech of the K. of G. B. on the 5th Dcr. 1782. arrived & produced great joy in general except among the Merchts. who had great quantities of merchandise in Store the price of which immediately & materially fell. The most judicious members of Congs. however suffered a great diminution of their joy from the impossibility of discharging the arrears & claims of the army & their apprehension of new difficulties from that quarter.

  Sir, Philadelphia, Feb' y 14th, 1783. In a letter which I wrote lately to General Schuyler,(1) I informed him of the import of the answer from Vermont, and what had been done with it in Congress. The Committee to whom it was referred have not yet reported; but I have little expectation of decision. Congress have been for some time employed on matters of the 1st importance, devising a plan for carrying the 8th Article of the Confederation into execution, and for funding all the debts of the United States. General principles with respect to the 1st object have been agreed upon, and are referred to a Committee to be digested into form. The plan is crude, and will be opposed in its last stage, but perhaps it will be adopted by a majority. With respect to funds we have made little progress, and from the turn of the debates, I have not sanguine hopes of proper measures. Whenever any thing has been matured it will be communicated to the State. I congratulate your Excellency on the strong prospect of peace which the late speech of the British King affords. I hope the conclusion of the war may not be the prelude of civil commotions of a more dangerous tendency. It is to be suspected the Army will not disband, till solid arrangements are made for doing it justice; and I fear these arrangements will not be made. In this position of things it will be wise in the State of New York to consider what conduct will be most consistent with its safety and interest. I wish the Legislature would set apart a tract of territory, and make a liberal allowance to every officer and soldier of the Army at large who will become a citizen of the State. A step of this kind would not only be politic in the present posture of affairs, but would embrace important future consequences. It is the first wish of my heart that the Union may last; but feeble as the links are, what prudent man would rely upon it? Should a disunion take place, any person who will cast his eye upon the map will see how essential it is to our State to provide for its own security. I believe a large part of the Army would incline to sit down among us, and then all we shall have to do will be to govern well. These are loose but important ideas. I wish they may occur with their  FEBRUARY 14, 1783  full weight to those who have it in their power to turn them to account. At present I mean them merely for your Excellency's consideration. I have the honor to be Yr. Excellency's most obedt. servt. A. Hamilton This letter by mistake has been delayed. Reprinted from Hamilton, Papers (Syrett), 3:255-56.  1 Not found.

  Dear Sir Philada. Feby. 15th. 1783.

He informed the Committee that there was a fit vessel in this river which wd. have sailed for France but for the prospect of peace afforded by the Speech; and which I suppose will still proceed if that prospect should fail.

  Dear Sir: [February 17, 1783](1) Have you fixed upon any place for our academy--are any subscriptions made for that institution? (2) On the moment we have peace we should begin the building. Be so good as to inform me whether any steps are taken in that business. I have been importuned by the friends of sundry gentlemen to engage them as teachers; this I could not do for the want of a house to teach in. I observe what you say of Mrs. Dawson's proposing to send her son on in the spring. I fear her affections are not much weaned from him in the course of the last twelve months, and the former affection will operate. Is it not clear that virtue consists in a medium? You see that even maternal affection, which is so necessary, and in that lady so conspicuous, hardly escapes the suspicion of being a fault. I am glad that you can only say you have been sick. I have written to General Benbury a long letter, and to Mr. Allen a short one, respecting some improvements for the extension of our commerce on the Peace Establishment.(3) I presume you will support those measures, provided you approve of them. By the education of our youth, and improvement of our commerce, and by these means alone, can we save our State from obscurity and debility. For more than four weeks have we been constantly engaged in attempting to establish public funds, or fix a scale for settling the quotas of the different States. To-day we have agreed in one resolution,(4) which the Southern States have carried with great difficulty; it is not so good as we wished, but the best we could get, for valuing the lands and their improvements, according to the Confederation. I believe we failed in twenty different plans before we fixed on one. I shall show you the Journal on the next month, which will explain some part of this business. The framers of our Confederation, with reverence be it said, were not infallible. Congress have reserved the power of making treaties; those treaties include the relations of commerce, and yet Congress has not reserved any power over commerce. We borrow money, and have not the means of paying sixpence. There is no measure, however wise or necessary, that may not be defeated by any single State, however small or wrong-headed. The cloud of public creditors, including the army, are gathering about us; the prospect thickens. Believe me, that I would rather take the field in the hardest military service I ever saw, than face the difficulties that await us in Congress within a few months. I have fervently desired peace. Whoever my successor may be in the delegation, I shall not envy his station. I shall wish him as much diligence, a little more patience, and a great deal more political knowledge.  Be pleased to present my respects, &c., and believe me to be, with the utmost regard, Dear Sir, Your obedient humble servant, H. W. Williamson.

The King of Brittain's Speech is full & explicit--you have no doubt seen it, e' er this. Mr. Townshends Letter is also to the Purpose. The Nantz Vessel could not bring any News, as notwithstanding what is said in the Papers, she could not bring News from Nantz later than the 14t or 15t Decr. & it is 150 Miles from Paris, so that the report of the final Treaty being signed on the 13 Decr may be true.

I am clear it will not do for you to go to New Rochelle till Matters subside a little after a Peace--you will be too much exposed, and I am apprehensive that the Country will be dangerous, at the first disbanding of the Army.

  Sir, Philadelphia Feby 18th 1783. I have been honoured with your Excellencies Letter of the 6th Instant by Mr. Livingston,(1) and am much obliged for the Information you gave me Respecting the Business before our Legislature; And also for the Information Reporting the Conduct of the people on the Grants. Chittenden's Answer to the Resolves of Congress is with a Committee, to whom I have Communicated the Information Contained in your Excellencie's Letter. I shall Endeavour to make the most of it. At this time a Majority of Congress seems to be of Different Sentiments Respecting those people from what they were Last winter; three States who were in their favour then, are now against them, yet seem to be afraid to Declare against them so pointedly as I could wish. As soon as the Committee Reports, and Congress Decides thereon, what ever their Decision may be, I shall without Loss of time, Advise your Excellency thereof, in order that if it should not be so much in our favour as we could wish, our State may have the Earliest opportunity of taking their own measures. It still appears clear to me that a Compromise with New Hampshire will be a very proper step to be taken and I do hope that our Legislature will before they Rise, do the needful on that Subject, to meet the wishes of New Hampshire as Communicated in their Letter to your Excellency last Summer. Before this Reaches you, I have no Doubt that you will have Recd the Speech of the King of Britain, which tho it does not tell us that a general peace has taken place, yet it holds out the Greatest probability that it has taken place long before this day, and hence we may Conclude that in the month of April we may again be in possession of our Capital (a most Desireable Event to the Refugees of our State). We are in hourly Expectation of a full and an Official Confirmation of the News of peace, tho there still Remains a possibility that it may not happen, which holds us in a very disagreeable State of Suspence. FEBRUARY 18, 1783  Congress have for sometime been Endeavouring to Devise some mode for Establishing funds for the payment of the Interest of All the Debts Due from those States, and altho it is very Discouraging, to Attempt a Business of that Kind after knowing the Backwardness of some of the States to Comply with anything that will have that effect, Congress are Determined, to, so far do their Duty, as to point out our Situation And what appears to be the most proper measures to be taken under those Circumstances, and if the States will not on their parts, do what is necessary for the Restoration of public Credit and the doing of Justice, the fault will be with them and not with us. The Impost of five per Cent with some variation will again be Recommended and I believe some others of a similar Nature. The Necessity and propriety of them we shall Endeavor to Impress on the States. We have Yesterday passed Resolutions Attempting to Carry in Effect the Eighth Article of the Confederation, and as they are passed, they are Disagreeable to me, for I think they will not Opporate Justly for our State which has been so long, so much, in the power of the Enemy, but they were Carried against us by a great Majority. I expect they will be transmited to the several States with some other Matters now under Consideration as soon as they are Determined on. I am Sorry to be under the necessity of mentioning to your Excellency anything that Relates particularly to my Self, Tho two hundred pounds which your Excellency forwarded me through Colo. Hay I have Recd and it is Expended, and as I do not Expect I can goe from here till some time in April, it will be absolutely Necessary that I have about one hundred and fifty pounds to Remove me from this place to My place of Aboad. I wrote to Mr. Lhommedieu that I thought one hundred would Carry me to April, But I am now fully Convinced it will not; therefore, must Beg your Excellencie's Interposition in my favour for the above sum. But if it should so happen that I cannot be furnished with the means for my Expenses, I will be much obliged to your Excellency to Notify me as soon as possible, that I may get from this Expensive place before I am too far Involved.

  Teusday. Feby. 18 [1783]. Come. of the whole on the subject of genl. funds. Mr. Rutlidge & Mr. Mercer proposed that the Impost of 5 PerCt. as altered & to be  FEBRUARY 18, 1783  recommended to the States,(1) should be appropriated exclusively, first to the interest of the debt to the army & then in case of surplus to the principal. Mr. R. urged in support of this motion that it would be best to appropriate this fund to the army as the most likely to be obtained as their merits were superior to those of all other Creditors, and as it was the only thing that promised, what policy absolutely required some satisfaction to them. Mr. Wilson replied that he was so sensible of the merits of the army that if any discrimination were to be made among the public creditors, he should not deny them perhaps a preference, but that no such discrimination was necessary, that the ability of the public was equal to its whole debt, and that before it be split into different [descriptions,] (2) the most vigorous efforts ought to be made to provide for it entire. That we ought first at least to see what funds could be provided, to see how far they would be deficient, and then in the last necessity only to admit discriminations. Mr. Ghorum agreed with Mr. Wilson. He said an exclusive appropriation to the army, would in some places be unpopular and would prevent a compliance of those States whose Citizens were the greatest Creditors of the United States; since without the influence of the public creditors the measure could never be carried through the States, and these if excluded from the appropriation would be even interested in frustrating the measure, & keeping by that means their cause a common one with the army. Mr. Mercer applauded the wisdom of the confederation in leaving the provision of money to the States, said that when this plan was deviated from by Congress, their objects should be such as were best known & most approved; that the States were jealous of one another, & wd. not comply unless they were fully acquainted with & approved the purpose to which their money was to be applied, that nothing less than such a preference of the army would conciliate them, that no Civil creditor would dare to put his claims on a levil with those of the army, and insinuated that the speculations which had taken place in loan office certificates might lead to a revision of that subject on principles of equity, that if too much were asked from the States they would grant nothing. He said that it had been alledged that the large public debt if funded under Congress would be a cement of the confederacy. He thought on the contrary it would hasten its dissolution; as the people would feel its weight in the most obnoxious of all forms that of taxation. On the question the States were all no except, S. Carolina which was ay.(3) A motion was made by Mr. Rutlidge 2ded by Mr. Bland to change the plan of the impost in such a manner as that a tariff might be formed for all articles that would admit of it, and that a duty adva-lorem sd. be collected only on such articles as would not admit of it.(4)  In support of such an alteration it was urged that it would lessen the opportunity of collusion between collector & importer, & would be more equal among the States. On the other side it was alledged that the States had not objected to that part of the plan, and a change might produce objections that the nature & variety of imports would require necessarily the collection to be advalorem & on the great part of them, that the forming of a book of rates (5) wd. be attended with great difficultes & delays, and that it would be in the power of Congress by raising the rate of the article to augment the duty beyond the limitation of 5 PerCt. and that consideration would excite objections on the part of the States. The motion was negatived.  A motion was made by Mr. Hamilton 2ded by Mr. Wilson; that whereas Congress were desirous that the motives & views of their measures sd. be known to their Constituents in all cases where the public safety wd. admit, that when the subject of finances was under debate the doors of Congs. sd. be open. Congs. adjourned it being the usual hour & the motion being generally disrelished.(6) The Pa. delegates said privately that they had brought themselves into a critical situation by dissuading their Constituents from Separate provision for Creditors of U.S. within Pena. hoping that Congr. wd. adopt a general provision, and they wished their Constituents to see the prospect themselves & to witness the conduct of their Delegates. Perhaps the true reason was, that it was expected the presence of public creditors numerous & weighty in Philada. wd. have an influence & that it wd. be well for the public to come more fully to the knowledge of the public finances.

  Dear Sir Philada. Feby. 18th. 1783. Your two favors of the 14th one of them inclosing a letter to Miss Floyd were recd. by yesterday's mail.(1) The last paper from N.Y. as the inclosed will shew you has brought us another token of the approach of peace. It is somewhat mysterious nevertheless that the preliminaries with America should be represented by Secy. Townsend as actually signed and those with France as to be signed, as also that the signing of the latter would constitute a general peace. I have never been without my apprehensions that some tricks would be tried by the British Court notwithstanding their exterior fairness, of late, and these apprehensions have been rendered much more serious by the {tenor of some letters}(2) which {you have seen} and particularly by the {intimation of minister of France to Mister Livingston}.(3) These considerations have made me peculiarly solicitous that your mission should be pursued as long as a possibility remained of {your sharing in} the {object of it}.

  My dear friend Philada. Feby. 18th. 1783. I am glad to find by your favor of the 7th instant (1) that the necessity of a readoption of the impost presses so strongly on your mind. To give it a fair experiment with the ensuing assembly it will be indispensable that you should be its advocate on the floor. Those who effected its repeal will never inactively suffer it to be reinstated in our Code. {Mercer}(2) from {what motive God knows says} that {he will crawl to R____d (3) on his bare knees to prevent it}. Having aleady {changed his opinion on the} subject {he fears perhaps} the {charge of unsteaddiness}. Perhaps too {his zeal} against {a general revenue may be cooled by} the accomplishment in {Congress of a plan} for a valuation of land, {on the ruins of} which {he among others} suspected the former was to be {established}. This plan passed Congress yesterday.(4) It proposes that the States shall return to Congs. before Jany next their respective quantities of land, the number of houses thereon distinguishing dwelling houses from others, and the no. of Inhabitants distinguishing Whites from blacks. These data are to be referred to a Grand Come. by whom a report in which nine voices must unite, is to be made to Congress which report is to settle the proportions of each State, & to be ratified or rejected by Congs. without alteration. Who could have supposed that such a measure could ever have been the offspring of a zealous & scrupulous respect for the Confederation? The residue of my extract from Mr. J____s remarks is I am persuaded less interesting to your present purposes than you infer from the specimen you have received.(5) The labor of gratifying you however I can assure you will bear no proportion to the pleasure of it, and you may calculate on being shortly furnished with it. I understand from Mr. J. that he has materials for enlarging the whole plan. My expectation of getting from him some day or other a full copy, reduced my extract to parts of immediate use to me, or such as consisting of reflections, not of facts might not be obtained otherwise. To the Speech of the B. King of which I sent you copy by the Express,(6) I now add in the inclosed gazette a further token of approaching peace. It seems a little mysterious nevertheless that Mr. Secy. Townsend should speak of the preliminaries with the United States as signed & those with France as to be signed. The former being  FEBRUARY 18, 1789  only provisional may in some measure explain it, but in that case it would seem to be without real use. In consequence of this prospect the departure of ______(7) has been suspended untill the further orders of Congress. I had a letter from him yesterday but he had not then been apprized of this resolution. He had seen the Speech & had I doubt not anticipated it.8 What course he will take during the suspense I cannot say. My wish is that he may return to this place where he will be able at least to pass away the time with less tedium. ""

I had in Answer to yours of the 26th of January which was sent you on the 12th Instant gave you full Information on the matter therein proposed. I have not yet been able to see Mr Wharton, he is not yet returnd from Mary' land tho expected every day. Imediately on receiving your's 2 days agoe, I again applyed to Judge Griffin. He has again adjourned the Court to the first monday in April, fully expects Mr Reed the other Judge will then be present, Judge Griffin assured me he would advertise it in the publick papers. I understand Mr Lewis of this City attorney is engaged in behalf of Stanton, but if you have oppertunity to give them Notice or Information it may not be Amiss, but suppose not Necessary. It seems by Mr Helmes' letter that you have never favoured him with the Copys from the Registers office in the Court of Appeals. I long agoe sent you Duplicates of the Decree of the Court granting a New Trial. The moment that was done it intirely Vacates the former Judgment rendered for a reversal and the matter now stands before the Court of Appeals as the Cause did before any Trial had and there is in fact no reversal of the first Judgment, nor any forfeiture on the bond. Genll Varnum came down here in behalf of Stanton &c on Notice of a New Trial, there was no Court, that could not revive the first Judgment of the Court of Appeals but it is Nullifyed. It really behoves them to have another Trial, for now the first Judgment before the Admiralty Court remains good & Valid tho possibly it has been Suspended for a time. I think the Assembly most assuredly in the present State of the Case will Suspend the operation of the Execution. It has been Impossible to have a Trial here for the reasons I have heretofore given you, there has been no Judges existing for a Considerable time, now there is, & no pain is spared to get them togeather.

  Wednesday February 19. [1783] (1) The motion made yesterday by Mr. Hamilton for opening the doors of Congress when the subject of finances should be under debate was negatived, Penna. alone being ay.(2) A motion was made by Mr. Hamilton seconded by Mr. Bland to postpone3 the clause of the report made by Come. of the whole for altering the Impost, viz, the clause limiting its duration to 25 years, in order to substitute a proposition declaring it to be inexpedient to limit the period of its duration: first because it ought to be compensurate to the duration of the debt. 2dly. because it was improper in the present stage of the business, and all the limitation of which it wd. admit had been defined in the Resolutions of 1782.(4) Mr. Hamilton said in support of his motion that it was in vain to attempt to gain the concurrence of the States by removing the objections publickly assigned by them against the Impost, that these were the ostensible & not the true objections: that the true objection on the part of R. I. was the interference of the impost with the opportunity afforded by their situation of levying contributions on Cont. &c which rcd. foreign supplies through the ports of R. I: that the true objection on the part of Va. was her having little share in the debts due from the U. S. to which the impost would be applied; that a removal of the avowed objections would not therefore, remove the obstructions whilst it would admit on the part of Congs. that their first recommendation went beyond the absolute exigences of the public; that Congs. having taken a proper ground at first, ought to maintain it till time should convince the States of the propriety of the measure. Mr. Bland said that as the debt had been contracted by Congress with the concurrence of the States, and Congs was looked to for payment by the public creditors, it was justifiable & requisite in them to pursue such means as would be adequate to the discharge of the debt: & that the means would not be adequate if limited in duration to a period within which no calculations had shewn that the debt wd. be discharged. On the motion the States were N. Hamshire divided, Masts. no, R. Island ay, Cont. divd, N. York. ay, N. Jersey ay, Pena. ay, Virga. no Mr. Bland ay, N. Carolina ay, S. Carolina ay. Mr. Rutlidge said he voted for postponing not in order to agree to Mr. Hamiltons motion but to move & he accordingly renewed the motion, made in the Come. of the whole; viz that the Impost should be appropriated exclusively to the army. This motion was seconded by Mr. Lee. Mr. Hamilton opposed the motion strenuously, declared that as a friend to the army as well as to the other Creditors & to the public at large he could never assent to such a partial dispensation of Justice;  FEBRUARY 19, 1783  that the different States being differently attached to different branches of the public debt would never concur in establishg a fund wch. was not extended to every branch; that it was impolitic to divide the interests of the civil & military Creditors, whose joint efforts in the States would be necessary to prevail on them to adopt a general revenue. Mr. Mercer favored the measure as necessary to satisfy the army & to avert the consequences which would result from their disappointment on this subject: he pronounced that the Army would not disband until satisfactory provision should be made, & that this was the only attainable provision; But he reprobated the doctrine of a permanent debt supported by a general & permanent revenue & said that it would be good policy to separate instead of cementing the interests of the Army & the other public creditors, insinuating that the claims of the latter were not supported by justice & that the loan office certificates ought to be revised. Mr. Fitzimmons observed that it was unnecessary to make a separate appropriation of the Impost to one particular debt, since if other funds sd. be superadded, there would be more simplicity & equal propriety in an aggregate fund for the aggregate debt funded: and that if no other funds should be superadded it wd. be unjust & impolitic: that the States whose Citizens were the chief creditors of the U. S. wd. never concur in such measure; that the mercantile interest which comprehended the chief Creditors of Pena. had by their influence obtained the prompt & full concurrence of that State in the Impost; and if that influence were excluded the State wd. repeal its law. He concurred with those who hoped the army wd. not disband un[less] provision sd. be made for doing them justice. Mr. Lee contended that as eve[r]ybody felt and acknowledged the force of the demands of the army, an appropriation of the Impost to them wd. recommend it to all the States: that distinct & specific appropriations of distinct revenues was the only true System of finance, and was the practice of all other nations who were enlightened on this subject; that the army had not only more merit than the mercantile creditors; but that the latter would be more able on a return of peace to return to the business which would support them. Mr. [Madison] said that if other funds were to be superadded as the gentleman (5) who made the motion admitted, it was at least premature to make the appropriation in question; that it wd. be best to wait till all the funds were agreed upon & then appropriate them respectively to those debts to which they sd. be best fitted; that it was probable the impost would be judged best adapted to the foreign debt; as the foreign Creditors could not like the domestic ever recur to particular States for separate payments, and that as this wd. be a revenue least felt, it would be prudent to assign it to those for whom the States wd. care least, leaving more obnoxious revenues to those Creditors who wd. excite the sympathy of their Countrymen and cd stimulate them to do justice.  Mr. Williamson was agst. the motion; said he did not wish the army to disband untill proper provision should be made for them; that if force sd. be necessary to excite justice, the sooner force were applied the better. Mr. Wilson was against the motion of Mr. Rutlidge, observed that no instance occured in the British history of finance in which distinct appropriations had been made to distinct debts already contracted; that a consolidation of funds had been the result of experience; that an aggregate fund was more simple & would be most convenient: that the interest of the whole funded debt ought to be paid before the principal of any part of it; and therefore in case of surplus of the impost beyond the interest of the army debt, it ought at any rate to be applied to the interest of the other debts, and not, as the motion proposed, to the principal of the army debt. He was fully of opinion that such a motion wd. defeat itself, that by dividing the interest of the civil from those of the military Creditors the provision for the latter would be frustrated. On the question on Mr. Rutledge's motion the States were N.H. no, Mas. no, Cont. no, N.J. no, Virga. no, Mr. Lee & Mr. Mercer ay, N.C. no, S. Carolina ay. On the clause reported by the Comee. of the whole in favor of limiting the impost to 25 years, the States N.H. ay, Mas. ay, Cont. divd.,(6) N.Y. no, N.J. no, Pa. ay, Va. ay, Mr. Bland no, N. Carolina ay, S. Carolina ay. So the question was lost. On the question whether the appointment of Collectors of the Impost shall be left to the States, the Collectors to be under the controul of & amenable to Congs. there were (7) ays--N.Y. & Pena. being no & N.J. divided.

  Sir Philadelpa. 19th Feb 1783 I have been favoured with your Letters of the 1t and 10t and thank you for the Intelligence therewith communicated. Soon after my coming here I waited on Mr Morriss and informed him that the State had for a long Time impatiently expected Mr Smith to come forward, he told me that he had not long before Sent him his Commission and Instructions, and that he would Very soon be upon this Business. After that I had not heard any Thing of him, and supposed that he was at Hartford, as I wrote to you some Time ago, and knew nothing to the contrary till I recd. your last Letter. I have since waited upon Mr Mor FEBRUARY 19, 1783  riss who has engaged to write this Post to a Mr Thompson of Boston who has been recommended to him by Mr. Gorham a Delegate from Massachusetts to undertake this Business. This must necessarily occasion a considerable Delay, but as I have fully represented to Mr Morris the Importance of the Subject of this Appointment, I have no doubt but a proper Attention will be given to it.(1)  Congress have passed an Act that Surveys shall be taken of all the located Lands of each State, and an Acct. of the Number of Houses and other Buildings, and also the Number of white and black People distinguishing each. This is to be done by the Authority of each State--and Returns are to be made by the first of Janry--upon which Congress have resolved that they will Appoint a Grand Committee which in Congress Language is a Member of Congress for each State to be Nominated by the Delegates of the State in Congress, each State appointing one. This Committee are to Adjust the Value of the Lands and Buildings of each State, and if nine of them shall agree upon a Valuation, which it is intended shall be made by the Materials furnished as mentioned and they are to return to Congress.  Congress are thereupon to approve or reject the Returns as they shall judge proper. This mode of Proceeding is supposed will be conformable to the eighth Article of the Confederation. I shall give you No Opinion of Mine upon this Proccess, any otherwise than that Shews the Imperfection of the 8th Article of the Confederation and will Shew also the Dificulty of adopting even a Mode for it's Execution when it shall be considered that the mode agreed to, took up a Week or more in its Investigation. This Valuation if Approved of by Congress is to Operate for five years from which the necessary Sums are to be derived for annual Supplys and is to serve as a Principle by which the Monies and Supplys which have been furnished the U States are to be adjusted--That is the Accounts of the several States are to be settled by the relative Value of each State so made.  Congress have passed an Act that they will Establish permanent Funds but this is easier said, than done by the federal Powers Vested in Congress. The publick Creditors are clamorous for Security. The Army are urgent for a Settlement of what by Acts of Congress they consider themselves as intituled to. Virginia without Notice has repealed her Act Vesting the U States with a Power to levy Duties, upon her having lately found out, it seems that it is inconsistent with her Sovereignty. R Island persists in her Obstanacy--how all these Soveraign People will agree in the Establishment of National Security is difficult to Say. We rathar feell our Embarrassments than know the mode by which We can extricate ourselves--and if Peace shall be establashed, which We flatter ourselves is the Case, yet the Vehement Demands for Justice, the Variety of Interest, Opinion and partial Considerations, prevailing in different States and Classes of People, proves but too clearly that much is yet to be done before Such Establish-  ments will be made or will effectually Unite, Secure and render the People of this Country happy to that Degree, as every benevolent Manner & Lover of his Country wishes to see it in the Possession of. But that governing merciful Providence which has in so uncommon a manner protected this Country, will I trust guide the People of it into such a Conduct as will be essential to their Happiness.  I believe that I have Sent to Hartford all that has been published in Regard to the Susquehannah Case, I will continue to do so, as I shall write to someone there every Week, to you principally--if the Papers here are recd. by any, I suppose that all the Communications will be made this Way which are necessary. I shall not therefore at present make any farther Provision on this Account either for you or Mr Goodwin as I shall suppose it unnecessary, unless I am farther advised upon the Subject.  I have no News in Regard to Peace but what you find in the Papers--and they afford no Evidence but what can be derived from his Brittannick Majestys Speech to his Parliament. No Vessells have arrived from Europe, that I know of Since that Period--but probably you will get News sooner from N York than from this Place.  My Compliments to Mr. Ellsworth, Mr Lyman and Friends. May God bless you. Regard the high Obligations of Vertue and Relegion. Mention to me as often as you shall know the Condition of the Family; I hear but seldom from them. Yours, Oliver Wolcott  PS. I beleive I shall send forward a Letter to Mr. Reeve inclosing one to the Family--if so you will Sent it forward as I suppose you weekly enquire at the P Office for Letters of mine.  I shall Attend to secure if I can to Authors their Copy Rights--for Some Time past Congress have been too much Occupied by important Subjects to introduce a Matter of this Nature. Send me by the next Post a Copy of our Act of Assembly on this Subject. Some Gentlemen of Influence are engaged to support the Proposition which you wish to establish.  ""

  Thursday Feby. 20. 1783 The motion for limiting the impost to 25 years having been yesterday lost, and some of the gentleman who were in the negative desponding of an indefinite grant of it from the States the motion was reconsidered. Mr. Wolcot & Mr. Hamilton repeat the inadequacy of a definite term. Mr. Ramsay & Mr. Williamson repeat the improbability of an indefinite term being acceded to by the States, & the expediency of preferring a limited impost to a failure of it altogether. Mr. Mercer was against the impost altogether but would confine his opposition within Congress: He was in favor of the limitation as an alleviation of the evil. Mr. Fitzimmons animadverted on Mr. Mercer's insinuation yesterday touching the loan-office Creditors,(1) & the policy of dividing them from the military Creditors, reprobated every measure which contravened the principles of justice & public faith; and asked whether it were likely that Mas. & Pa. to whose Citizens 1/2 the loan office debt was owing would concur with Virga. whose Citizens had lent but little more than three hundred thousand dollars, in any plan that did not provide for that in common with other debts of the U. S. He was against a limitation to 25 years. FEBRUARY 20, 1783  Mr. Lee wished to know whether by Loan office Creditors were meant the original subscribers or the present holders of the certificates, as the force of their demands may be affected by this consideration. Mr. Fitzimmons saw the scope of the question, and said that if another scale of depreciation was seriously in view he wished it to come out, that every one might know the course proper to be taken. Mr. Ghorum followed the Sentiments of the gentleman who last spoke, expressed his astonishment that a gentleman (Mr. Lee) who had enjoyed such opportunities of observing the nature of public credit, should advance such doctrines as were fatal to it. He said it was time that this point sd. be explained, that if the former scale for the loan office certificates was to be revised and reduced as one member from Virga. (Mr. Mercer) contended, or a further scale to be made out for subsequent depreciation of Certificates, as seemed to be the idea of the other member (Mr Lee), the restoration of public credit was not only visionary but the concurrence of the States in [any] arrangemts. whatever was not to be expected. He was in favor of the limitation as necessary to overcome the objections of the States. Mr. Mercer professed his attachment to the principles of justice but declared that he thought the scale by which the loans had been valued unjust to the public & that it ought to be revised & reduced. On the question for the period of 25 years it was decided in the affirmative seven States being in favor of--N. Jersey & N. York only being no.(2) Mr. Mercer called the attention of Congress to the case of the goods siezed under a law of Pena. on which the Come. had not yet reported, and wished that Congs. would come to some resolution declaratory of their rights & which would lead to an effectual interposition on the part of the Legislature of Pena.(3) After much conversation on the subject in which the members were somewhat divided as [to] the degree of peremptoriness with which the State of Pa. should be called on, the Resolution on the Journal was finally adopted; having been drawn up by the Secy. & put into the hands of a member.(4) The Resolution passed without any dissent.(5) The evening of this day was spent at Mr. Fitz____ns by Mr. Ghorum, Mr. Hamilton, Mr. Peters, Mr. Carroll & Mr M[adison]. The conversation turned on the subject of revenue under the consideration of Congress, and on the situation of the army. The conversation on the first subject ended in a general concurrence (Mr. H____n excepted) in the impossibility of adding to the impost on trade any taxes that wd. operate equally throughout the States,(6) or be adopted by them. On the second subject Mr. Hamilton & Mr. Peters who had the best knowledge of the temper, transactions & views of the army, informed the company that it was certain that the army had secretly determined not to lay down their arms until due provision & a satisfactory prospect should be afforded on the subject of their pay; that there was   reason to expect that a public declaration to this effect would soon be made; that plans had been agitated if not formed for subsisting themselves after such declaration; that as a proof of their earnestness on this subject the Commander was already become extremely unpopular among almost all ranks from his known dislike to every unlawful proceeding, that this unpopularity was daily increasing & industriously promoted by many leading characters; that his choice of unfit & indiscreet persons into his family was the pretext and with some a real motive; but the substantial one a desire to displace him from the respect & confidence of the army in order to substitute Genl. << >(7) as the conductor of their efforts to obtain justice. Mr. H. said that he knew Genl. Washington intimately & perfectly, that his extreme reserve, mixed sometimes with a degree of asperity of temper both of which were said to have increased of late, had contributed to the decline of his popularity; but that his virtue his patriotism & his firmness would it might be depended upon never yield to any dishonorable or disloyal plans into which he might be called; that he would sooner suffer himself to be cut into pieces; that he (Mr H) knowing this to be his true character wished him to be the conductor of the army in their plans for redress, in order that they might be moderated & directed to proper objects, & exclude some other leader who might foment & misguide their councils; that with this view he had taken the liberty to write to the Genl. on this subject and to recommend such a policy to him.(8) ""

Mr. Mercer made some remarks tending to a reconsideration of the act declaring general funds to be necessary, which revived the discussion of that subject.(1) Mr [Madison] said that he had observed through[ou]t the proceedings of Congress relative to the establishment of such funds that the power delegated to Congress by the confederation had been very differently construed by different members & that this difference of construction had materially affected their reasonings & opinions on the several propositions which had been made; that in particular it had been represented by sundry members that Congress was merely an Executive body; and therefore that it was inconsistent with the principles of liberty & the spirit of the Constitution, to submit to them a permanent revenue which wd. be placing the purse & the sword in the same hands; that he wished the true doctrine of the confederation to be ascertained as it might perhaps remove some embarrassments; and towards that end would offer his ideas on the subject. He said that he did not conceive in the first place that the opinion was sound that the power of Congress in cases of revenue was in no respect Legislative, but merely Executive: and in the second place that admitting the power to be Executive a permanent revenue collected & dispensed by them in the discharge of the debts to wch. it sd. be appropriated, would be inconsistent with the nature of an Executive body, or dangerous to the liberties of the republic. As to the first opinion he observed that by the articles of Confederation Congs. had clearly & expressly the right to fix the quantum of revenue necessary for the public exigences, & to require the same from the States respectively in proportion to the value of their land; that the requisitions thus made were a law to the States, as much as the acts of the latter for complying with them were a law to their individual members: that the fOEderal constitution (2) was as sacred & obligatory as the internal constitutions of the several States; and that nothing could justify the States in disobeying acts warranted by it, but some previous abuse or infraction on the part of Congs.; that as a proof that the power of fixing the quantum & making requisitions of money, was considered as a legislative power over the purse, he would appeal to the proposition made by the British Minister of giving this power to the B. Parliamt. & leaving to the American assemblies the privileges of complying in their own modes; & to the reasonings of Congress & the several States on that proposition. He observed further that by the articles of Confederation was delegated to Congs. a right to borrow money indefinitely, and emit bills of Credit which was another species of borrowing, for repayment & redemption of which the faith of the  FEBRUARY 21, 1783  States was pledged & their legislatures constitutionally bound. He asked whether these powers were reconcileable with the idea that Congress was a body merely Executive? He asked what would be thought in G. B. from whose constitution our Political reasonings were so much drawn, of an attempt to prove that a power of making requisitions of money on the Parliament, & of borrowing money for discharge of which the Parlt sd. be bound, might be annexed to the Crown without changing its quality of an Executive branch; and that the leaving to the Parliamt. the mode of complying with the requisitions of the Crown, would be leaving to it its supreme & exclusive power of Legislation? As to the second point he referred again to the British Constitution & the mode in which provision was made for the public debts; observing that although the Executive had no authority to contract a debt; yet that when a debt had been authorized or admitted by the parliament a permanent & irrevocable revenue was granted by the Legislature, to be collected & dispensed by the Executive; and that this practice had never been deemed a subversion of the Constitution or a dangerous association of a power over the purse with the power of the Sword.  If these observations were just as he concieved them to be, the establishment of a permanent revenue not by any assumed authority of Congress, but by the authority of the States at the recommendation of Congs. to be collected & applied by the latter to the discharge of the public debts, could not be deemed inconsistent with the spirit of the fOEderal constitution, or subversive of the principles of liberty; and that all objections drawn from such a supposition ought be withdrawn. Whether other objections of sufficient weight might not lie agst. such an establishmt. was another question. For his part altho' for various reasons (3) he had wished for such a plan as most eligible, he had never been sanguine that it was practicable & the discussions which had taken place had finally satisfied him that it would be necessary to limit the call for a general revenue to duties on commerce & to call for the deficiency in the most permanent way that could be reconciled with a revenue established within each State separately & appropriated to the Common Treasury. He said the rule which he had laid down to himself in this business was to concur in every arrangemt. that sd. appear necessary for an honorable & just fulfilment of the public engagements; & in no measure tending to augment the power of Congress which sd appear to be unnecessary; and particularly disclaimed the idea of perpetuating a public debt. Mr. Lee in answer to [Mr. Madison] said the doctrine maintained by him was pregnant with dangerous consequences to the liberties of the confederated States; that notwithstanding the specious arguments that had been employed it was an established truth that the purse ought not to be put into the same hands with the Sword; that like arguments had been used in favor of Ship money in the reign of Charles I it being   then represented as essential to the support of the Govt., that the Executive should be assured of the means of fulfilling its engagements for the public service: He said it had been urged by several in behalf [of] such an establishment for public credit that without [it] Congress was nothing more than a rope of sand. On this head he would be explicit; he had rather see Congress a rope of sand than a rod of Iron. He urged finally as a reason why some States would not & ought not to concur in granting to Congress a permanent revenue, that some States as Virga, would receive back a small part by paymt. from the U.S. to its Citizens; whilst others as Pena. wd. receive a vast surplus; & consequently be enriched by draining the former of its wealth. Mr. Mercer said if he conceived the fOEderal compact to be such as it had been represented he would immediately withdraw from Congress & do every thing in his power to destroy its existence: that if Congs. had a right to borrow money as they pleased and to make requisitions on the States that wd. be binding on them, the liberties of the States were ideal;(4) that requisitions ought to be consonant to the Spirit of liberty; that they should go frequently & accompanied with full information, that the States must be left to judge of the nature of them, of their abilities to comply with them & to regulate their compliance accordingly; he laid great stress on the omission of Congs. to transmit half yearly to the States an acct. of the monies borrowed by them &c. and even insinuated that this omission had absolved the States in some degree from the engagements. He repeated his remarks on the injustice of the rule by which loan office certificates had been settled, & his opinion that some defalcations would be necessary. Mr. Holten was opposed to all permanent funds, and to every arrangement not within the limits of the Confederation. Mr. Hamilton enlarged on the general utility of permanent funds to fOEderal interests of this Country, & pointed out the difference between the nature of the Constitution of the British Executive, & that of the U. S. in answer to Mr. Lee's reasoning from the case of Ship money. Mr. Ghorum adverted with some warmth to the doctrines advanced by Mr. Lee & Mercer concerning the loan office Creditors. He said the Union could never be maintained on any other ground than that of Justice; that some States had suffered greatly from the deficiencies of others already; that if Justice was not to be obtained through the fOEderal system & this system was to fail as would necessarily follow, it was time this should be known that some of the States might be forming other confederacies adequate to the purposes of their safety. This debate was succeeded by a discharge of the Committee from the business of devising the means requisite for restoring public credit &c &c, and the business referred a Come. consisting of Mr. Ghorum, Mr. Hamilton, Mr. Madison, Mr. Fitzimmons & Mr. Rutlidge.(5)  ""

  Sir, Philadelphia February 24th. 1783 (1) In my letter of the 14th I informed Your Excellency that Congress were employed in devising a plan for carrying the 8th article of the confederation into execution. This business is at length brought to a conclusion. I inclose for the information of the Legislature the proceedings upon it in different stages, by which they will see the part I have acted.(2) But as I was ultimately left in a small minority, I think it my duty to explain the motives upon which my opposition to the general sense of the house was founded. I am of opinion, that the article of the confederation itself was ill- judged. In the first place I do not believe there is any general representative of the wealth of a nation, the criterion of its ability to pay taxes. There are only two that can be thought of land and numbers. The revenues of the United Provinces (general and particular) were computed before the present war to more than half as much as those of Great Britain. The extent of their territory is not one fourth part as great, their population less than a third. The comparison is still more striking between those Provinces and the Swiss-Cantons in both of which extent of territory and population are nearly the same, and yet the revenues of the former are five times as large as those of the latter, nor could any efforts of taxation bring them to any thing like a level. In both cases the advantages for agriculture are superior in those countries which afford least revenue in proportion. I have selected these examples, because they are most familiar, but who ever will extend the comparison between the different nations of the world, will perceive that the position I have laid down is supported by universal experience. FEBRUARY 24, 1783  The truth is the ability of a country to pay taxes depends on infinite combinations of physical and moral causes, which can never be accommodated to any general rule, climate, soil, productions, advantages for navigation, government, genius of the people, progress of arts and industry, and an endless variety of circumstances. The diversities are sufficiently great in these states to make an infinite difference in their relative wealth--the proportion of which can never be found by any common measure whatever. The only possible way then of making them contribute to the general expence in an equal proportion to their means is by general taxes imposed under Continental authority. In this mode there would no doubt be inequalities and for a considerable time material ones; but experience and the constant operation of a general interest which by the very collision of particular interests must in the main prevail in a Continental deliberative would at length correct those inequalities, and ballance one tax that should bear hard upon one state by another that should have a proportional weight in others. This idea however was not at the period of framing the confederation, and is not yet agreeable to the spirit of the times. To futurity we must leave the discovery how far this spirit is wise or foolish. One thing only is now certain that Congress having the discretionary power of determining the quantum of money to be paid into the general treasury towards defraying the common expences, have in effect the constitutional power of general taxation. The restraints upon the exercise of this power amount to the perpetuating a rule for fixing the proportions which must of necessity produce inequality, and by refusing the fOEderal government a power of specific taxation and of collection, without substituting any other adequate means of coertion do in fact leave the compliance with Continental requisitions to the good will of the respective states. Inequality is inherent in the theory of the confederation, and in the practice that inequality must increase in proportion to the honesty or dishonesty of the component parts. This vice will either in its consequences reform the fOEderal constitution or dissolve it. If a general standard must be fixed numbers were preferable to land. Modes might be devised, to ascertain the former with tolerable precision, but I am persuaded the experiment will prove, that the value of all the land in each state cannot be ascertained with any thing like exactness. Both these measures have the common disadvantage, of being no equal representative of the wealth of the people; but one is much more simple, definite and certain than the other. I have indulged myself in these remarks to show that I have little expectation of success from any mode of carrying the article in question into execution upon equitable principles. I owe it however to myself to declare that my opposition did not arise from this source.   The confederation has pointed out this mode--and though I would heartily join in a representation of the difficulties (of which every man of sense must be sensible on examination) that occur in the execution of the plan to induce the states to consent to a change, yet as this was not the disposition of a Majority of Congress, I would have assented to any mode of attempting it which was not either obviously mischievous or impracticable. The first plan proposed (3) as Your Excellency will see was an actual valuation of each state by itself. This was evidently making the interested party judge in his own cause. Those who have seen the operation of this principle between the counties in the same state and the districts in the same county cannot doubt a moment that the valuations on this plan would have been altogether unequal and unjust. Without supposing more liberality in one state than in another the degree of care, judgment and method employed in the execution would alone make extreme differences in the results. This mode had also the further inconvenience of awakening all the jealousies of the several states against each other. Each would suspect that its neighbour had favoured itself, whether the partiality appeared or not. It would be impossible to silence these distrusts and to make the states sit down satisfied with the justice of each other. Every new requisition for money would be a new signal for discussion and clamour, and the seeds of disunion already sown too thick would be not a little multiplied. To guard against these evils the plan proposes a revision by Congress; but it is easy to be seen that such a power could not be exercised. Should any states return defective valuations, it would be difficult to find sufficient evidence to determine them such--to alter would not be admissible, for Congress could have no data, which could be presumed equivalent to those which must have governed the judgment of Commissioners under oath on an actual view of the premisses--to do either this, or to reject would be an impeachment of the honor of the states which it is not probable there would be decision enough to hazard--and which if done could not fail to excite serious disgusts. There is a wide difference between a single state exercising such a power over its own counties and a confederated government exercising it over sovereign states, which compose the confederacy. It might also happen, that too many states would be interested in the defective valuations to leave a sufficient number willing either to alter or to reject. These considerations prevailed to prevent the plan being adopted by a Majority. The last plan may be less mischievous than the first,(4) but it appears to me altogether ineffectual. The mere quantity of land granted and surveyed with the general species of buildings upon them can certainly be no criteria to determine their value. The plan does not even   distinguish the improved from the unimproved land--the qualities of soil, or degrees of improvement--the qualities of the houses and other buildings are intirely omitted. These it seems are to be judged of by the commissioners to be appointed by each state; but I am unable to conceive how any commissioner can form the least estimate of these circumstances with respect even to his own state, much less with respect to other states, which would be necessary to establish a just relative value. If even there was a distinction of improved from unimproved land, by supposing an intrinsic value in the land and adopting general rates something nearer the truth might be attained; but it must now be all conjecture and uncertainty. The numbers of inhabitants distinguishing white from black are called for. This is not only totally foreign to the confederation but can answer no reasonable purpose. It has been said that the proportion of members may guide and correct the estimates; an assertion purely verbal. A judgment must first be formed of the value of the lands upon some principles. If this should be altered by the proportion of numbers, it is plain numbers would be substituted to land. Another objection to the plan is, that it lets in the particular interests of the states to operate in the returns of the quantities of land, number of buildings and number of inhabitants. But the principle of this objection applies less forcibly here than against the former plan. Whoever will consider the plain import of the 8th article of the confederation must be convinced that it intended an actual and specific valuation of land, buildings and improvements, not a mere general estimate according to the present plan. While we insist therefore upon adhering to the confederation, we should do it in reality not barely in appearance. Many of those who voted for this scheme had as bad an opinion of it as myself; but they were induced to accede to it, by a persuasion that some plan for the purpose was expected by the states, and that none better in the present circumstances of the country could be fallen upon. A leading rule which I have laid down for the direction of my conduct is this--that while I would have a just deference for the expectations of the states, I would never consent to amuse them by attempts, which must either fail in the execution or be productive of evil. I would rather incur the negative inconveniences of delay than the positive mischief of injudicious expedients. A contrary conduct serves to destroy confidence in the government, the greatest misfortune that can befal a nation. There should in my opinion be a character of wisdom and efficiency in all the measures of the fOEderal council, the opposite of a spirit of temporising concession. I would have sufficient reliance on the judgments of the several states to hope that good reasons for not attempting a thing would be more satisfactory to them than precipitate and fruitless attempts. My   idea is that taking it for granted the states will expect an experiment on the principles of the confederation the best plan will be to make it by Commissioners appointed by Congress and acting under their authority. Congress might in the first instance appoint three or more of the principal characters in each state for probity and abilities, with a power to nominate other commissioners under them in each subdivision of the state. General principles might be laid down for the government of their conduct by which uniformity in the manner of conducting the business would obtain. Sanctions of such solemnity might be prescribed and such notoriety given to every part of the transaction, that the commissioners could neither be careless nor partial without a sacrifice of reputation. To carry this plan however into effect with sufficient care and accuracy would be a work both of time and expence; and unfortunately we are so pressed to find money for calls of immediate necessity that we could not at present undertake a measure, which would require so large a sum. To me it appears evident that every part of a business, which is of so important and universal concern should be transacted on uniform principles and under the direction of that body which has a common interest. In general I regard the present moment probably the dawn of peace as peculiarly critical; and the measures which it shall produce as of great importance to the future welfare of these states. I am therefore scrupulously cautious of assenting to plans which appear to me founded on false principles. Your Excellency will observe that the valuation of the lands is to be the standard for adjusting the accounts for past supplies, between the United States and the particular states. This if adhered to without allowance for the circumstances of those states which have been more immediately the theatre of the war, will charge our state for the past according to its future ability when in an entire condition; if the valuation should be finally made after we regain possession of the parts of the state now in the power of the enemy. I have therefore introduced a motion for repeating the call in a more earnest manner upon the states to vest Congress with a power of making equitable abatements, agreeable to the spirit of the resolution of the 20th of February last which few of the states have complied with. This motion has been committed.(5) I know not what will be its fate. Nothwithstanding the opposition I have given, now the matter has been decided in Congress, I hope the state will chearfully comply with what is required. Unless each state is governed by this principle, there is an end of the union. Every state will no doubt have a right in this case to accompany its compliance with such remarks as it may think proper. I have the honor to be, Yr. Excellency's Most Obedient servant Alx Hamilton FEBRUARY 25, 1783  P.S. After the plan was agreed upon, it was committed to be put into form, and when reported instead of Commissioners an alteration was carried for making the estimate by a Grand Committee. Feby. 27. Mr. Morris has signified to Congress his resolution to resign by the first of June if adequate funds are not by that time provided.(6) This will be a severe stroke to our affairs. No man fit for the office will be willing to supply his place for the very reasons he resigns. Tis happy for us we have reason to expect a peace; I am sorry that by different accounts it appears not to have been concluded late in December. ""

By two arrivals one here from Teneriffe, and another at Baltimore from St Kitts there are reports that all negotiations for Peace are broken off but from the most calm examination of them, think they amount to nothing to be attended to. When you write to the Speaker enclose it to the Governor & he will forward it--as he lives down at Cumberland out of your Way. As to Jonas Post, I am not fond of his Tenantship, unless, I had a prospect of getting the rent, and I do not choose to go to any Expence of Rails or to suffer it to be ploughed for that rent. I will consent that whatever Rails are carried on may be taken off again, unless I choose to pay for them at the End of the Year.

As to the large Horse Colt unless he promisses very fair, I will sell him as soon as I can get a Chap--I think he must be worth £25 or £30. As to the Fence along the Barn, if you have rails enough, I should be glad--perhaps it might be Contrived by making two rails pretty high on crotches. If the Horses are turned out, the large Colt must be hoppled with the Iron hopples.

  No Congress till Teusday 25 [February 1783]. In favor of the motion of Mr. Gilman to refer the officers of the army for their half pay to their respective States (1) it was urged that this plan alone would secure to the officers any advantage from that engagement: since Congress had no independent fund out of which it could be fulfilled, and the States of Cont. & R. I. in particular would not comply with any recommendation of Cong. nor even requisition for that purpose. It was also said that it would be satisfactory to the  FEBRUARY 25, 1783  officers; and that it would apportion on the States that part of the public burden with sufficient equality. Mr. Dyer said that the original promise of Congress on that subject was considered by some of the States as a fetch upon them, and not within the spirit of the authority delegated to Congress. Mr. Wolcot said the States wd. give Congs. nothing whatever unless they were gratified in this particular. Mr. Collins said R. I. had expressly instructed her delegates to oppose every measure tending to an execution of the promise, out of monies under the disposition of Congress. On the other side it was urged that the half pay was a debt as solemnly contracted as any other debt; and was consequently as binding under the 12th article of Confederation on the States,(2) & that they could not refuse a requisition made for that purpose; that it would be improper to countenance a spirit of that sort by yielding to it; that such concessions on the part of Congs. wd. produce compliances on the part of the States, in other instances, clogged with favorite conditions; <<that a referrence of the officers to the particular States to whose lines they> belong, would not be satisfactory to the officers of those States who objected to half pay, and would increase the present irritation of the army; that to do it without their unanimous consent would be a breach of the army contract by which the U. S. collectively were bound to them; and above all that the proposed plan, which discharged any particular State which should settle with its officers on this subject, altho' other States might reject the plan, from its proportion of that part of the public burden, was a direct and palpable departure from the law of the Confederation. According to this instrument the whole public burden of debt must be apportioned according to a valuation of land, nor cd. any thing but unanimous concurrence of the States dispense with this law. According to the plan proposed so much of the public burden as the 1/2 pay sd. amount to, was to be apportioned according to the number of officers belonging to each line; the plan to take effect as to all those States which should adopt it, without waiting for the unanimous adoption of the States, and that if Congress had authority to make the number officers the rule of apportioning one part of the public debt on the States, they might extend the rule to any other part or the whole, or might substitute any other arbitrary [rule] which they should think fit.(3) ""

  My dear Sir Philada. Feby. 25th. 1783. Congress are still engaged on the subject of providing adequate revenues for the public debts, particularly that due to the army. The recommendation of the Impost will be renewed with perhaps some little variation, to which will be superadded probably a duty on a few enumerated art[i]cles. {Master Mercer altho' he}(1) continues to {be adverse to} the {measure declares now that he will not carry his opposition out of Congress}. Whether any other general revenues will be recommended is very uncertain. A poll tax seems to be the only one sufficiently simple & equal for the purpose, and besides other objections to which even that is liable, the Constitution of Maryland which interdicts such a tax is an insuperable bar. The plan talked of by some for supplying the deficiency is to call on the States to provide each its proportion of a permanent revenue within itself, and, to appropriate it to the continental debt. The objections against this plan are that as the execution of it will depend on a unanimous & continued punctuality in the 13 States, it is a precarious basis for public credit--that the precariousness will be increased by mutual jealousies among the States that others may be sparing themselves exertions which they are submitting to; and that these jealousies will be still more encreased by the mutual opinion which prevails that they are comparatively in advance to the U. States; an opinion which cannot be corrected without closing the accounts between all of them & the U. States; prerequisites to which are a valuation of the land, and a final discrimination of such parts of the separate expenditures of the States as ought to be transferred to the common mass, from such parts as ought in justice to fall on the particular States themselves. Some States also will contend and it would seem neither agst. the principles of justice nor the spirit of the Confederation, for a retrospective abatement of their share of the past debt according to their respective disabilities from year to year throughout the war. What will be the end of this complication of embarrassments time only can disclose. But a greater embarrassment than any is s[t]ill behind. The {discontents and designs of} the {army are every day taking a more solemn form}. It is {now whispered} that {they have not only resolved not to lay down their arms till justice shall be done them} but that {to prevent surprize a public declaration will be made to that effect}. It is {added and I fear with too much} certainty, {that the influence of General Washington} is {rapidly decreasing in the army insomuch that} it is {even in contemplation to substitute some less scrupulous guardian of their interests}.(2) There are a variety of rumours concerning peace but none of them of sufficient authority to be particularized. The Speech of the King of G. B. to his parliament and the letter to the Lord Mayor of London  FEBRUARY 25, 1783  from Secy. Townsend as it is stated are the only respectable evidence yet recd. There are also rumours on the adverse side which have still less the complection of authenticity. A quantity of cloathing on its passage through this State to the British prisoners of war under a passport of Genl Washington was lately siezed and condemned under a law of this State agst. the importation of British goods. After several fruitless experiments to prevail on the siezors to relinquish their appeal to the law, the Legislature have I am told cut the business short by declaring the law as far as it interfered with the authority of the passport to be unconstitutional & void ab initio.(3) You will suffer me to renew my exhortations to you to an exchange of your office under the State for a seat in the Legislature. It depends much in my opinion on the measures which may be pursued by Congress & the several States within the ensuing period of 6 months whether prosperity & tranquility, {or confusion and disunion} are to be the fruits of the Revolution. The seeds of the latter are so thickly sown that nothing but the most enlightened and liberal policy will be able to stifle them. The {Eastern states} particularly {Massachusetts conceive} that {compared with} the {Southern} they are greatly in {advance in} the {general accounts}.

Will not in that event the {S[outhern] S[tates] which at sea} will be {opulent &} weak, be an {easy prey to the eastern} which {will be powerful and rapacious? &} particularly if supposed {claims of justice} are {on the side of the latter} will they not be a {ready pretext for reprisals?} The consequence of such a situation would probably be that {at alliances} would be {sought} first {by the weaker and then by the stronger party &} this {country} be {made subservi[ent] to the wars & politics of Europe}.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia, 26th Feb. 1783 I had the honor of receiving your Excellency's letter of the 30th ult. which I immediately laid before Congress, who, without delay, gave it the full attention it deserved. The result of their deliberations I do myself the pleasure to enclose.(1) The Secretary of Foreign Affairs will make the confidential communication to your Excellency mentioned therein, I hope, by this opportunity.(2) The critical state of our Finances obliges Congress to the most disagreeable parsimony, altho' the objects proposed, are certainly of the highest consequence, and which will engage their attention, at all events, in case of the least change of appearances. By a Vessel arrived yesterday from Teneriffe, and one a few days ago at Baltimore from St. Kitts, there are various Reports about all negociations for Peace being broke up at Paris; but sifting them well and duly considering dates and other circumstances, they amount to nothing worthy of attention.

  Dear Sir,(1) Philadelphia Feby. 26 1783 Mr. Bingham of this place who was some time Agent for the Board of Warr at Martinico has in his hands a ballance due to Government, which he informs me he is ready to pay to any person authorised to recive it. I suggest to you the propriety of furnishing me with a power of attorney or an order on him for it, which would prevent the necessity of my drawing money for my support here out of the Treasury, where it is wanted for other purposes. I am uncertain wither it lay with you or the Committe of accounts to adjust those ballances. However if a power comes it must be accompanyd with the several votes of Court for disolving the Board & placing the powers in other hands. I have wrote to my Brother on the subject,(2) do confer with him on the subject. The Leiut Governor in a Letter to Docr. Holten(3) represents the exertions of Massachusetts--(which you & I know are great) and compares them with some of the other States and asks wither we think the people will long bear it. We can only answer that the powers of Congress are not adequate to the means of doing justice between the States--and that while the States continue so jealous of Congress they cannot be made so. I perceive the Boston News papers contain inflam- FEBRUARY 26, 1783  atory peices against the impost which with other circumstances may possibly so farr prevail as to induce a repeal--but I am more & more convinced that those States which have beene forward will never obtain justice untill funds are established--and Unless such establishments are made or some alteration in the articles of confederation take place the union must ere long dissolve. Virginia have now only one Regiment of Soldiers & have paid no more than 35 thousand dollars of the 8 millions & have sent word to Congress that they can pay very little more on that requesition & at the same time are very averse to funds--the army very desirous of their two years wages and a sett[le]m[ent], and if a peace as expected Soon takes place what shall we do with them if they refuse (As some people expect) to disband. Our situation will be bad enough--the publick creditors are very clamourous for their interest--and Congress under all those dificultys a mear shadow. I write this in confidence as some people would say from those sentiments that my head was turnd that I was intoxicated with power &c. not considering that in a few months I should be as much under the power of Congress as any man whatever--but let such people be some time in Congress & they will alter their opinion.

  Wednesday Feby. 26 [1783]. Mr. Lee observed to Congress that it appeared from the Newspapers of the day that sundry enormities had been committed by the  FEBRUARY 26, 1783  Refugees within the State of Delaware, as it was known that like enormities had been committed on the shores of the Chesapeak, notwithstanding the pacific professions of the Enemy;(1) that it was probable however that if complaint were to be made to the British commander at N. York the practice would be restrained, He accordingly moved that a Committee might be appointed to take into consideration the means of restraining such practices. The motion, 2ded by Mr. Peters. By Mr. Fitzimmons the motion was viewed as tending to a request of favors from Sr. Guy.(2) It was apprehended by others that as Genl Washington & the Commanders of separate armies had been explicitly informed of the sense of Congress on this point, any fresh measures thereon might appear to be a censure on them; and that Congress cd. not ground any measure on the case in question; having no official information relative to it. The motion of Mr. L. was negatived. But it appearing from the vote to be the desire of many members that some step might be taken by Congress, The motion of Mr. Madison & Mr. Mercer as it stands on the Journal was proposed and agreed to, as free from all objections.(3) A motion was made by Mr. Hamilton to give a brevet Commission to Majr. Burnet aid to Genl. Greene & messenger of the evacuation of Charleston, of L. Colonel. There being six ays only the motion was lost. N. H. no. Mr. Lee & Mercer no.(4) The Committee consisting of Mr. Lee &c. to whom had been referred a motion of Mr. Hamilton recommending to the States to authorize Congress to make abatements in the retrospective apportionment by a valuation of land, in favor of States whose ability from year to year had been most impaired by the war:(5) reported that it was inexpedient to agree to such motion because one State (Virga.) having disagreed to such a measure on a former recommendation of Congress, it was not probable that another recommendation would produce any effect; and because the difficulties of making such abatements were greater than the advantages expected from them. Mr. Lee argued in favor of the report & the reasons on which it was grounded. The Eastern delegates were for leaving the matter open for future determination when an apportionment should be in question. Mr. [Madison] said he thought that the principle of the motion was conformable to justice & within the spirit of the Confederation: according to which apportionmts ought have been made from time to time throughout the war according to the existing wealth of each State. But that it would be improper to take up this case separately from other claims of equity which would be put in by other States: that the most likely mode of obtaining the concurrence of the States in any plan wd. be to comprehend in it the equitable interests of all of them; a comprehensive plan of that sort would be the only one that would cut off all sources of future controversy among the States: That   as soon as the plan of revenue sd. be prepared for recommendation to the States it would be proper for Congs. to take into consideration & combine with it every *object which might facilitate its progress, & form a complete provision for the tranquility of the U. States. The Question on Mr. Hamilton's motion was postponed.(6) The letter from Mr. Morris requesting that the injunction of secresy might be withdrawn from his preceding letter signifying to Congress his purpose of resigning was committed to.(7) *He (8) had in view the followg. objects--1. the abatements proposed by Mr. Hamilton. 2. a transfer into the common mass of expences of all the separate expences incurred by the States in their particular defence. 3. an acquisition to the U. States of the vacant territory. The plan thus extended would affect the interest of the States as follows, viz. N. Hamshipire would approve the establishment of a General revenue, as tending to support the confederacy, to remove causes of future contention, and to secure her trade against separate taxation from the States thro which it is carried on. She would also approve of a share in the vacant territory. Having never been much invaded by the Enemy her interest would be opposed to abatements, & throwing all the separate expenditures into the common mass. The discharge of the public debts from a common treasury would not be required by her interest, the loans of her citizens being under her proportion. See the Statement of them.(9) Massachusetts, is deeply interested in the discharge of the public debts. The expedition to Penobscot alone interests her, as she supposes, in making a common mass of expences: her interest is opposed to abatements. The other objects wd. not peculiarly affect her. Rhode Island as a weak State is interested in a general revenue as tending to support the confederacy and prevent future contentions, but against it as tending to deprive Her of the advantage afforded by her situation of taxing the commerce of the contiguous States. as tending to discharge with certainty the public debts, her proportion of loans interest her rather against it. Having been the seat of the war for a considerable time, she might not perhaps be opposed to abatements on that account. The exertions for her defence having been previously sanctioned, it is presumed in most instances, she would be opposed to a common mass of expences.(10) In the acquisition of vacant territory she is deeply and anxiously interested. Connecticut is interested in a general revenue as tending to protect her commerce from separate taxation by N. York & Rhode Island: and somewhat as providing for loan office creditors. Her interest is opposed to abatements, and to a common mass of expences.(11) Since the condemnation of her title to her Western claims, she may perhaps consider herself interested in the acquisition of the vacant land. In other respects she wd not be peculiarly affected.  York is exceedingly attached to general revenue as tending to support the confederacy and prevent future contests among the States. Although her citizens are not lenders beyond the proportion of the State, yet individuals of great weight are deeply interested in provision for public debts. In abatements N. York is also deeply interested. In makg. a common mass also interested, and since the acceptance of her cession, interested in those of other States. N. Jersey is interested as a smaller State in a general revenue as tendg to support the confederacy, and to prevent future contests and to guard her commerce agst. the separate taxation of Pensylvania & N.Y. The loans of her Citizens are not materially disproporti[on]ate. Although this State has been much the theatre of the war, she wd. not perhaps be interested in abatements. Havg had a previous sanction for particular expenditures, her interest wd. be opposed to a common mass. In the vacant territory, she is deeply and anxiously interested. Penna. is deeply interested in a general revenue, the loans of her Citizens amounting to more than 1/3 of that branch of the public debt. As far as a general impost on trade would restrain her from taxing the trade of N. Jersey it would be against her interest. She is interested against abatements; and against a common mass, her expenditures having been always previously sanctioned.(12) In the vacant territory she is also interested. Delaware interested by her weakness in a general revenue as tending to support the confederacy & future tranquility of the States; not materially by the credits of her Citizens. Her interest is opposed to abatements & to a common mass. To the vacant territory she is firmly attached. Maryland. Having never been the Seat of war & her Citizens being creditors below her proportion, her interest lies agst. a general revenue, otherwise than as she is interested in common with others in the support of the Confederacy & tranquility of the U. S., against abatements, and against a common mass. The vacant is a favorite object to her. Virga. in common with the Southern States as likely to enjoy an opulent and defenceless trade is interested in a general revenue, as tending to secure to her the protection of the Confederacy agst. the maritime superiority of the E. States; but agst it as tending to discharge loan office debts and to deprive her of the occasion of taxing the commerce of N. Carolina. She is interested in abatements, and essentially so in a common mass, not only her excentric expenditures being enormous; but many of her necessary ones havg. rcd. no previous or subsequent sanction. Her cession of territory would be considered as a sacrifice. N. Carolina. interested in a general revenue as tending to ensure the protection of the Confederacy agst. the maritime superiority of the E. States and to guard her trade from separate taxation by Virginia and S. Carolina. The loans of her Citizens are inconsiderable.(13) In   abatements and in common masss she is essentially interested. In the article of territory, she would make a sacrifice. South Carolina is interested as a weak & exposed State in a general revenue as tending to secure to her the protection of the confederacy agst. enemies of every kind, and as providing for the public creditors, her citizens being not only loan offices creditors beyond her proportion, but having immense unliquidated demands agst. U. States. As restraining her power over the commerce of N. Carolina, a general revenue is opposed by her interests. She is also materially interested in abatements, and in a common mass. In the article of territory her sacrifice wd. be inconsiderable. Georgia as a feeble, an opulent, & frontier State is peculiarly interested in a general revenue, as tending to support the confederacy. She is also interested in it somewhat by the credits of her Citizens. In abatements She is also interested, and in a common mass, essentially so. In the article of territory She would make an important sacrifice. To make this plan still more complete for the purpose of removing all present complaints, and all occasions of future contests, it may be proper to include in it a recommendation to the States to rescind the rule of apportioning pecuniary burdens according to the value of land, & to substitute that of numbers, reckoning two slaves as equal to one free man.

  Dr. Sr. Philada. 27th February 1783 Your favors of the 14th Decr. last and the 11th inst. have been duly received(1)--a series of ill health through the fall and the greatest part of the winter and which untill very lately rendered my attendance in Congress seldom and very irregular must be my apology for suffering the first to remain so long unanswered. Congress have been for some time past almost wholely employed in devising some general and adequate funds for paying the interest and  FEBRUARY 27, 1783  in time sinking the principal of the public debt as well as to provide for future loans should the continuance of the War render borrowing necessary--difficulties apparently insurmountable presented themselves in almost every stage of the business, owing to the different circumstances of the several States, and the necessity, that the subjects selected for taxation to form the funds, should operate throughout them all, generally and equally, or nearly so to make them acceptable. After opening and discussing a variety of questions, no object has been yet discovered, to which so few objections lie, as the impost duty formerly recommended to the States, and which, with some alterations from the former plan to obviate the objections that have been raised, has been agreed to in a Comtee. of the whole and will I think be finally adopted. What this duty, when granted by the States will amount to annually, is very uncertain--in time of peace there can be no doubt but it will be considerable and for years prove an increasing fund, but it is thought by no means adequate to the payment of the interest and sinking the principal of the national Debt. Other means have therefore been considered in aid of the impost Duty--Land, Polls, Salt, Wine, Spirits, Tea &c, these last being what are called luxuries it is thot may bear a small tax in addition to the impost duty. I fear at present few of these will go down, and that we shall be obliged at last to rest the payment of the public debt upon the mode prescribed by the Confn. (requisitions proportioned on the States according to the value of land, buildings &c, a plan for obtaining which scale of proportion has been digested and agreed upon in Congress and will immediately go on to the States,) and the produce of the 5 Per Cent duty if granted. A small poll tax, did not the Constitution of Maryland stand in the way, might probably succeed, as it wod. operate more equally perhaps then any other, and may be adopted, allowing Maryland to substitute some other adequate and productive fund in its room. A short time will bring to a conclusion our efforts on this business, which I am in hopes will terminate in the adoption of such measures as may be acceptable to the States, and produce the granting such funds as will restore public credit, give value to the great mass of depreciated certificates, and enable Congress to render, to every Class of the public Creditors, ample justice. Congress have the purest intentions towards the public Creditors, and will use their best exertions in obtaing from the States the means to do them speedy and compleat justice--such is their opinion of the merit and services of the Army that did it not wound the sense of justice, they want not the inclination to give them the preference to any other class of Creditors but equity and sound policy forbid discrimination and Partial distinctions. One ground of discontent in the Army, and on which they found the opinion, that justice is not intended to be done to them, is the delay in complying with their requests--but with those acquainted with the deliberations of public bodies, and especially of so mixed a Body as that of Congress, allowances will be made for slow determination.   Every class of public Creditors must know the inability of Congress to pay their demands, unless furnished with the means by the several States, and the exertions of that body have not been wanting, heretofore, to obtain the means, though they have not produced the desired effect. The measures now digesting will, there is good reason to expect, prove more efficacious, for obvious reasons. Reports are freely circulated here that there are dangerous combinations in the Army, and within a few days past it has been said, they are about to declare, they will not disband untill their demands are complied with. I trust these reports are not well founded, and that the Army will exercise awhile longer at least, that patient forbearance, which hath hitherto so honourably distinguished them--to you it must be unnecessary to observe, that when once all confidence between the civil and military authority is lost, by intemperate conduct or an assumption of improper power, especially by the military body, the Rubicon is passed and to retreat will be very difficult, from the fears and jealousies that will unavoidably subsist between the two Bodies. To avoid therefore the adoption by the army of any [hasty and] rash measure, should employ the attention, and draw forth the exertions of every worthy officer in it--for from these alone can opposition be expected. The Ambition of some, and the presence of distress in others, may produce dangerous combinations founded on the pretence that justice is delayed, and will be refused to them--the protest is plausible and ensnareing, and may draw into engagements the unsuspecting honest Soldier, from which it will be difficult to extricate himself, even when he sees the dangers they lead to. If there are Men in the Army who harbour wicked designs, and are determined to blow the coals of discord, they will gradually endeavour to hurt the Reputation of those, averse to their projects, and by sinister practices lessen their weight and influence among the Soldiery. I have lately heard there are those who are abandoned enough to use their arts to lessen your popularity in the Army, in hopes ultimately the weight of your opposition will prove no obstacle to their ambitious designs. If this be true, and they are likely to succeed, I own it will prove a bad prognostic of the future & I shall be among the number of those who entertain fears of the Army, and doubt that Peace will not be followed by its usual blessings to America. Whether to temporise, or oppose with steady unremitting firmness, what is supposed to be in agitation of dangerous tendency, or that may be agitated, must be left to your own sense of propriety, and better judgment.(2) With respect to the business of Vermont I think you need not be uneasy from apprehensions that the Army or any part of them will be employed to enforce a compl[iance] with the act of the 5th of Decr. last should the people of Vermont refuse a compliance with that demand at least for some time to come if ever. To go into detail upon   this matter wod. be prolix and rather improper for the scope of a letter. It cannot be denied that the act of Congress of the of Augt.(3) opened the prospect to Vermont, of an acknowledgement of their independence and admission into the Union--altho' it gave ground of hope, it was not conclusive, and the legislature of Vermont absolutely rejecting the offer, and recommending to the people an inviolable adherence to their Union and encroachments on the adjoining States (and which, as well as other unwarrantable acts they have unjustly concealed from the public in their remonstrance) released Congress from their offer, and left them at liberty afterwards to accept or refuse as they saw fit, when Vermont repenting of her conduct at a future period complied--a particular state of things produced the act of Congress, a change of circumstances afterwards dictated the delay in determining on their proposition, and the report of a Committee to whom it was referred. That Report authorizes observations I decline to make--this proceeding in Congress they stile a violation of the Compact entered into with them. There always has been a strong opposition to the claims of Vermont and their admission into the Union. Virginia has generally been among the number of her opponents, not so much perhaps upon the question of independence as the impolicy of her admission into the Union, while several very important questions of local concern remained undetermined, and untill these great points are settled the consent of Virginia I expect will be withheld and if before obtained, it will be a sacrifice of her Opinion to the peace and commonweal of the U. States. If Vermont confines herself to the limits assigned her, and ceases to encroach upon and disturb the quiet of the adjoining States, at the same time avoiding combinations or acts hostile to the U. States, she may be at rest within her limits, and by patient waiting the convenient time, may ' ere long be admitted to the privileges of Union. The influence Vermont has gained in the Army and in some of the States that espouse her cause, do little credit to the parties concerned, and to this influence is in a great measure to be ascribed the variable, indecisive conduct of Congress, respecting the claims of that people. The remonstrance states the receipt of Official letters recommending a compliance with the act of Congress, and intimates yours to be of the number, and that these communications influenced them to comply. The assertion is wrong as to yours and may be equally false as to others, and is one proof among a variety of others of the disingenuity and want of candour in Vermont--it exhibits also very little respect to this Body, when they ascribe their compliance to other motives than the recommendation of Congress. Seven States have voted 5 years whole pay as the commutation for the half pay to the officers--but the resolution has not passed the House being postponed for the present from an opinion prevalent   with many, that the consent of nine States is necessary to give it validity.(4) Delaware and Georgia are absent, were they represented, probably the vote wod. be sufficient. That we shall have peace soon is almost reduced to a certainity-- but my fears are it will not be attended with their blessings generally expected. There are so many great questions very interesting to particular states unsettld, which require speedy determination to preserve quiet, that it is difficult to avoid uneasy impressions for their consequences--the present conjuncture, perhaps, above all others America has experienced, calls for good dispositions in the States, and moderation and wisdom in their Councils. May the Spirit of Union govern them is the earnest wish of D Sr., yr aff hum. Servt, Jos. Jones. ""

  Thursday Feby. 27 [1783]. On the report of the Come. on Mr. Morris's letter the injunction of secresy was taken off without dissent or observation.(1) The attention of Congress was recalled to the subject of half pay by Messrs. Dyer & Wolcot, in order to introduce a reconsideration of the mode of referring it separately to the States to provide for their own lines.(2) Mr. Mercer favored the reconsideration, representing the commutation proposed, as tending in common with the funding of other debts, to establish & perpetuate a monied interest in the U. S., that this monied interest would gain the ascendance of the landed interest, would resort to places of luxury & splendor, and by their example & influence, become dangerous to our republican constitutions. He said however that the variances of opinion & indecision of Congress were alarming & required that something should be done; that it wd be better to newmodel the Confederation, or attempt any thing rather than do nothing. FEBRUARY 27, 1783  Mr. [Madison] reminded Congs. that the commutation proposed was introduced as a compromise with those to whom the idea of pensions was obnoxious & observed that those whose scruples had been relieved by it had rendered it no less obnoxious than pensions by stigmatizing it with the name of a perpetuity. He said the public situation was truly deplorable. If the payment of the capital of the public debts was suggested, it was said & truly said to be impossible; if funding them & paying the interest was proposed, it was exclaimed agst. as establishing a dangerous monied interest, as corrupting the public manners, as administering poison to our republican constitutions. He said he wished the revenue to be established to be such as would extinguish the capital as well as pay the interest within the shortest possible period; and was as much opposed to perpetuating the public burdens as any one. But that the discharge of them in some form or other was essential, and that the consequences predicted therefrom could not be more heterogeneous to our republican character & constitutions, than a violation of the maxims of good faith and common honesty. It was agreed that the report for commuting 1/2 pay, should lie on the table till tomorrow, in order to give an opportunity to the Delegates of Connecticut to make any proposition relative thereto which they should judge proper.(3) The report of the Comme. consisting of Mr. Ghorum, Mr. Hamilton, Mr. Madison, Mr. Rutlidge & Mr. Fitzimmons was taken up. It proposed that in addition to the impost of 5 PerCt. ad valorem, the States be requested to enable Congs. to collect a duty of 1/8 of a dollar per bushel on salt imported, of 6/90 per Gallon on all wines do. and of 3/90 per Gallon on all rum & brandy do.(4) On the first article it was observed on the part of the East. States, that this would press peculiarly hard on them on acct. of the salt consumed in the fisheries, and that it would besides be injurious to the national interest by adding to the cost of fish, and a draw back was suggested. On the other side it was observed that the warmer climate & more dispersed settlements of the Southern States, required a greater consumption of salt for their provisions, that salt might & would be conveyed to the fisheries without previous importation, that the effect of the duty was too inconsiderable to be felt in the cost of fish & that as the rum used in the N. E. States being in a great degree manufactured at home, they would have a greater advantage in this respect, than the other States could have in the article of Salt, that a drawback could not be executed in our complicated governmt. with ease or certainty. Mr. Mercer on this occasion declared that altho' he thought those who opposed a general revenue right in their principles, yet as they appeared to have formed no plan adequate to the public exigences, and he was convinced of the necessity of doing something, he should   depart from his first resolutions and strike in with those who were pursuing the plan of a general revenue. Mr. Holten said that he had come lately into Congress with a predetermination against any measures for discharging the public engagements other than those pointed out in the confederation, & that he had hitherto acted accordingly. But that he saw now so clearly the necessity of making provision for that object, and the inadequacy of the confederation thereto, that he should concur in recommending to the States a plan of a general revenue. A question being proposed on the duty on salt there were 9 ays, N. H. alone being no. R. I. not prest. It was urged by some that the duty on wine should be augmented, but it appeared on discussion & some calculations, that the temptation to smuggling wd. be rendered too strong & the revenue be thereby diminished. Mr. Bland proposed that instead of a duty on the gallon an advalorem duty should be laid on wine, and this idea after some loose discussions, was agreed to; few of the members interesting themselves therein, and some of them havg. previously retired from Congress.

  Friday February 28 [1783]. A motion was made by Mr. Wolcot and Mr. Dyer to refer the half pay to the States, little differing from the late motion of Mr. Gilmon, except that it specified 5 years whole pay as the proper ground of composition with the Officers of the respective lines. On this proposition the arguments used for & agst. Mr. Gilmon's motion were recapitulated. It was negatived, Cont. alone answering in the affirmative and no division being called for.(1) On the question to agree to the report for a commutation of 5 years whole pay, there being 7 ays only it was considered whether this was an appropriation or a new ascertainment of a sum of money necessary for the public service. Some were of opinion at first that it did not fall  FEBRUARY 28, 1783  under that description: finally, the contrary opinion was deemed almost unanimously the safest, as well as the most accurate.(2) Another question was whether 7 or 9 votes were to decide doubts whether 7 or 9 were requisite on any question. Some were of opinion that the Secretary ought to make an entry according to his own judgment and that that entry sd. stand unless altered by a positive instruction from Congs. To this it was objected that it wd. make the Secy. the Sovereign in many cases, since a reversal of his entry wd. be impossible, whatever that entry might be; that particularly he might enter 7 votes to be affirmative on a question where 9 were necessary, and if supported in it by a few States it wd. [be] irrevocable. It was said by others that the safest rule wd. be to require 9 votes to decide in all cases of doubt whether 9 or 7 were necessary. To this objected that one or two States and in any situation 6 States might by raising doubts, stop seven from acting in any case which they disapproved. Fortunately on the case in question there were 9 States of opinion that nine were requisite, so the difficulty was got over for the present.(3) On a reconsideration of the question whether the duty on wine should be on the quantity or on the value, the mode reported by the Come was reinstated, and the whole report recommited to be included with the 5 PerCt. advalorem in an act of recommendation to the States.(4) ""

  Dear Sir Philadelphia March 2nd 1783 I recievd your favor by Brown, but he will not give me time to Answer any one letter I recievd by his little tarry & suden departure. Tho the Prospects are here Strong for Peace expect ever day to hear the Conclusion. Congress have a Packet in France sent off with dispatches Early last fall. The moment Peace is Concluded, or if War is to Continue Another Year, she will sail to bring us the Intelligence, but alas should the War Continue Our Army must disband, we Cannot keep them in the field 2 months longer even Subsist them & no pay. Our assembly it seems refuse to raise a farthing. Many others tho they agree to Grant yet pay none. Our Financier has Anounced his resignation to quit the 1st of May. If it should be Peace we are loudly threatned by our Army. They will not disband till they are recompenced & paid for they Imagine if they once disband all is at an end with them. The Numerous Creditors are Clamorous, and will pay no more taxes till they are paid or secured, on their Interest. Our  MARCH 2, 1783  prospects are general Confusion, Clamour & tumult & intestine broils, Commotions and divisions here I am full of anxiety & perplexity, exert my feeble Efforts to reduce expences & but in Vain. Nothing can be more unpopular in our assembly. I am wearied out being here. My prospects are no better by all the accounts I recieve from my own Country if I return home. The Numerous Civil list & expensive sallaries have been all adopted in the 2 last years when I had no part here and a foundation laid for a great part of the troubles we are now Involved in. I have indeavoured with all my might to gain some relief, but with little Success, as it is ten times as difficult to undoe what has been done & establishd as to have prevented when proposed. The objection to revoke half pay or to referr them to the states is principally this that a former Congress have engaged it, the States by Confederacy are bound by it, it is a solemn Compact with our officers, we cannot retract it, tho ever so unwise & Imprudent when done & they are terrifyed even with the threats of the Army to do themselves Justice & represent Connecticut officers the most Clamorous & pressing & call on Congress to secure their protest against trusting the State. A Comtee from the Army has been here all winter Petitioning Congress waiting for the result both as to pay, security for their pay & halfpay. For that they propose a Commutation. All our calculations upon lives have been set at Work & they make out about six years full pay (no rations) after the War to be the amount on an Average. Congress have Voted or nearly Voted 5 years whole pay after the War as a sufficient Compensation. As we cannot get off the half pay Establishment, had we not better Comply with that than to be entangled with half pay for life? I wish I knew there would be no end in enumerating our Dificulties and holding out Our prospects, Peace or War. God almighty Governs the World, he has Delivered us out of many Troubles & fears, he still is able, let our Trust be in him & we are Calm. Let Tempest roar, he can still their rage & the Tumult of the People. We know many things are wrong. They always have been so and allways will, which requires more Labor, Patience, and Exertion. If the People clamour against me I know I have indeavoured their good, if I must suffer for others & they have the Praise, it is my lot, I have been accustomed to it, I hope I shall be Content, I expect not praise but blame, it has been the lot of their best friends & of those who have exerted themselves the most with the greatest fidelity to serve them. I have not, I cannot expect any better. I do not serve them on Wages, it is to do my Utmost for them & then expect their reproaches. Experience has taught me. I am not dismay'd (hic murus Aheneus esto, Nil conscrire sibi nulla pallescere Culpa)(1) ie, in my publick Conduct. As to the Event of the Susqh Cause (2) we must Submit to Providence. We had the weight of Congress, they would hear to no delay, they pushed with Violence & we had nothing to hope, if we had left them to have Nominated the Men they would  MARCH 3, 1783  have got a list most obnoxious to us, it is true we might have struck off & who would have been left. It is true we Consented to 2 New England men. I had no great expectations from their Superior abilities but supposed not only justice but Policy backd with the Interest of the People in Rhodisland who had alway gone hand in hand in the Cause with us ensured us Success with them. Then we had 3 from Virginia of whom we had no doubt. Then we Consented to Jersey Gentn really without Confidence in them but as we knew also their abilities were not great to Govern & influence that we were safe which was enough we could expect to choose all ourselves. But Providence has Interposed to Prevent 2 from Virginia attending & brot on Whipple whom we did not at all expect by what we heard would come so our cause is Lost. Who is to blame. Judge you but however if the State is uneasy with their expence I will give them double to every farthing they have ever expended, for a bare Quit Claim to the Western Territory in their Latitude Notwith- standing why then Grumble. I have done. My great respect to Govr Trumbull. Acknowledge his favor & shall soon give him an Answer.(3) We have applied for a list of all offices in the Civill list, Staff &c with their sallaries, pay &c &c (4) which with the Journals which are expected to be compleat in a few days will be sent forward as soon as prepared.

  Dr. sr. Philada. March 3d 1783 The present suspense, in which political events of the Utmost importance hang, tho truely interesting--affords little matter for intel- MARCH 3, 1783  ligence. All that we know about the situation of the Pacific negotiations amounts to the Philosophers ne plus ultra viz, that we know nothing, Conjecture indeed has an extensive field to range in. The King of G.B. speech has opend the gate, where Imagination has free liberty to range and glut itself. The Commercial world have been thrown into a consternation--the Political into a Stupor. Bets run high & spirits low alternately--for my part--having a propensity to reason with the rest of my fellow creatures--I have hazarded my conjectures also. I build them on the following grounds. Great Britain has evidently given up the Idea of the Conquest of America. She has now (and will if the war continues have a still greater) inferiority of Naval force to that of the combined powers with which she is engaged--no prospect of any effectual aid from any ally. She must therefore be on the defensive at sea; her finances as appears from the Speech are not in the best state--what therefore can she hope from another campaign and that defensive, both by land & sea in the East, W Indies, in America & Europe--add to this her councils divided by strong opposition, & her ministers not firmly seated in their places. My conclusion is that England must have peace--that the Allies will dictate it. No war supplies appear to have been calld for at the opening of the Parliament. No intelligence has been received further than that containd in the speech, a Packet (the Washington) was in waiting to bring over the result of the negotiations, no account Authentic, of the sailing of the combined fleet. All these contribute to evince that the negotiations are still going on, and not far from a conclusion. I leave you to Judge of the event. I think they are strong Symptoms of approaching [. . . .] I must request the favor of you to inform me in your next, of the Progress you have made in my land Warrant--and what you suppose to be the real Value of it, as I propose selling it if I have an offer worth accepting.

Mr. Bland moved that &c (See Journal of Mar. 5) (4) This motion produced on these two days lengthy & warm debates.(5) Mr. Lee & Mr. Bland on one side disparaging the administration of Mr. Morris, and throwing oblique censure on his character. They considered his letters as an insult to Congs. & Mr. Lee de[c]lared that the man who had published to all the world such a picture of our national character & finances was unfit to be a minister of the latter.(6) On the other side Mr. Wilson & Mr. Hamilton went into a copious defence &  MARCH 4, 1783  Panegyric of Mr. Morris, the ruin in which his resignation if it sd. take effect wd. involve public credit and all the operations dependent on it; and the decency altho' firmness of his letters.

  Dear Sir. Philadelphia 5th March 1783. Two days since we asked the attention of Congress to making your Excellency a grant for your expenses while President of Congress; I believe some Gentlemen wou'd willingly have passed it over without making any grant, & others were for making a larger one than I think would have met with the approbation of Congress, & after some time spent upon the matter it was committed, but I believe it will not be long before some grant will be made.(1) Your Excellency will perceive by the public prints that the Superintendent of finance is about resigning his office, which I am sorry for, as it will undoubtedly embarrass our finances still more, which are great already; it might have been as well if his letters to Congress had not been in the public prints, as I have no reason to think it will help the common cause, & I suspect some persons are of opinion that some expressions in them are a little exceptionable, but they have not yet produced any Special resolutions of Congress. By the inclosed (2) you will see the administration of them for a given time.  We are still expecting European intelligence of importance.

  Dr. Sr. Philada. [March 5? 1783] (1) I have your favor of the 20th ult by the Post yesterday. Col. Monroe will be disappointed in his expectations of meeting Mr. Jefferson at Hampton or pursuing him to France that Gentleman being now here and his departure delayed in expectation of receiving very speedily certain accounts of the issue of the negociations at Paris.  Mr. Cartwright may have called to see me but I never heard of such a persons being here. As to Mr. Swan's relying on me or Mr. Dawsons directing Mr. Cartwright to look to me for the payment of the balance now demanded by Mr. Swan, I apprehend there must be some mistake as Mr. Swan has had my Sentiments upon the matter and Mr. Dawson informed me when here he shod. take measures for the settlement of Swans balance when it was shewn what it really was, which I conceive  MARCH 5, 1783  was proper for him to do as well for his interest as credit. The bill mentioned to me here by Mr. Cuningham was a draught of Swans on Hunter & Co. for £260 or thereabouts, withot. Mr. Dawsons name appearing in it that I recollect. There was no reason to consider that bill as the debt of Dawson tho' it may in fact be so. Besides Mr. Dawson shod. pay only what he owed and it did not appear the Tobaccos delivered to your Company were accounted for. So far with respect to Mr. Dawson--as to myself the same objections on his account may be raised with this addition that Mr. Swan totally disregarded my orders and supplyed Mr. Dawson upon his own credit and when he was of age settled I understand the account wth. him and accepted him as paymaster--otherwise I suppose Mr. Swan wod. have furnished me with his statement of accot. that if I was to be answerable I shod. know for what. Mr. Swan may be a very worthy man and may be considered by Mr. Dawson in a friendly light. I think his conduct deserves a different appellation. If payment is to be made Mr. Dawson must make it. I will take no step whatever in the business as he is in possession of his Estate and knows what consideration he received for the money demanded.  When a Consul for the U. provinces shall be proposed, (2) you may be assured I will if in Congress give you all the assistance I can to get you appointed. I wish you could contrive with the Treasurer the exchanging Morris Notes for Tobacco--the Delegation want a remittance, the Treasurer is to make it and has the disposal of Tobacco.

  Dear Sir Philadelphia March 5th. 1783 I had the pleasure of receiving your Letter relative to Capt. Landais.(1) The representation made by Mr. Morris of his behaviour at the Office of Finance did him such disservice that I am persuaded it  MARCH 5, 1783  woud be in vain for me to propose any thing in his favor, & woud be considerd as aimd at Mr. Morris, not intended to do justice.  The resignation of Mr. Morris, & the manner of it are a great shock to public credit.(2) At bottom it is certainly a manouvre to force the system of funding upon the States, in which Mr. Morris & his friends are so deeply interested as to hazard the destruction of this Country, rather than not realise the immense wealth, which large purchases of Loan Office Certificates at an infinitly low depretiation, has offerd to their hopes. I hope the good sense & discernment of the Public will see this factious measure in its true light. This only can prevent its malignant operation here; but abroad the full misschief of it must be felt, & I fear will put an insurmountable bar in the way of Loans, upon which only we depend. This Morris coud not be ignorant of, & therefore the injury done is a deliberate Act, & deserves exemplary punishment. That punishment will not proceed from Congress, untill the public voice calls for it. Such is his influence here. But you know the stage & the chief Actors; & can be at no loss to form a just judgment.  I beg you will present my best Compts. to Mrs Adams, Genl Ward, Warren &c. Farewell, A.L. P.S.

  Sir, Philadelphia March 5th, 1783.  Mr. Hamilton having transmitted your Excellency the late proceedings of Congress for Carrying the 8th Article of the Confederation into execution by which the Legislature will see the part we Acted in this affair.(1) They will not be at a Loss for our motives; and we hope  MARCH 5, 1783  will not disapprove them. Our opposition to the first plan proposed was founded principally on the Consideration that it left the Interested partys Judge in their own Cause, might have produced great injustice and inequality and would in all probability have excited great Jealousies between the Respective States. We Dissented from the Second plan chiefly because we did not perceive that it afforded sufficient data to make the valuations upon and because it applied the 8th Article of the Confederation in Such a manner as would have produced great Injustice to the State of New York, and others in similar circumstances by Charging us with our proportion of the past Contributions of the States, according to our future ability when the Valuation shall be made.  After this plan was Resolved upon; we Introduced a motion to Call a Second time upon the different States to vest Congress with a power of making equitable abatements agreeable to the Resolution of the 20th Feby. 1781.(2)  This was committed and an unfavourable Report made, which together with the Original motion was postponed.  We renewed the motion in a something different form, which has been negatived by a Large majority. We have the honour to enclose the motion and the Votes upon it.(3) Different motives operated in the Dismission. Many were opposed to the principle, and others wished to postpone till this matter with many others could be taken up on a general plan.  Your Excellencys Letter by Mr. Shattuck has been read in Congress and with the papers accompanying it Committed to the same Committee which has before them, the Remonstrance from Chittenden.(4) We need not assure you that we shall pay all the attention in our power to a matter so Interesting to the State, which however we are obliged to see postponed to the Consideration of funds for Restoring the Credit of the United States, which now Occupies the first Attention of Congress.  We are, Sir, with the Greatest Respect your Excellencys most Obedt. and humble Servts, Wm. Floyd  Alex Hamilton.  Reprinted from Clinton, Papers (Hastings), 8:83-85. According to Edmund C.

The Affair of the Commutation for the Half pay to meet the Prejudices of the Eastern States has been on the Carpet but the Question was lost.

Manner in which the interests of the several States will be affected by these objects: N. Hamshire will approve the establishment of permanent revenue, as tending to support the confederacy, to remove cause of future contention, and to guard her trade from taxation by the States through which it is carried on: the loans of her Citizens being under her pro- MARCH 6, 1783  portion, she has not that motive. Having never been much invaded will be agst. abatements--for the same reason agst. common mass--covets a share of vacant territory.  Massts. is deeply interested in the provision for the public debts by the loans of her citizens--agst. abatements. The Penobscot expedition alone interests her in a common mass. The other objects do not particularly affect her.  R. I. being a weak State is interested in a permanent revenue as tending to support the confederacy and prevent future contentions; but agst. it as tending to deprive her of the occasion of taxing commerce of neighbouring states. Her proportion of loans does not interest her in it. Not opposed to abatements, nor agst. a common mass, having been long the seat of war,(3) anxious for territorial cessions.  Connecticut, interested in genl. revenue as tending to shelter her trade from taxation by N.Y. & R.I. & in some degree as providing for loan office debts, her loans being above her proportion. Strenuous agst. abatements--in favor of common, having often employed militia without sanction of Congss.(4) Since the condemnation of her title to West claims interested in the cessions of other States.  N.Y. strongly attached to permant. revenue as tending to support the Confederacy &c. Altho her Citizens are not lenders beyond her proportion yet individuals of great weight are deeply interested in the funds, deeply & peculiarly interested in abatements--favorable to a common mass. Since the acceptance of her cession of territory interested in those of other states.  N.J. interested as a small State in the tendency of permanent revenue to support the Confederacy &c.--& to save her commerce from taxation by Pa. & N.Y. The loans of her Citizens are not materially disproportionate altho much the Seat of War not interested in abatements & her expenditures have been previously sanctioned, solicitous for territorial cessions.  Pena. deeply interested by the loans of her Citizens in a permanent revenue. As far as revenue from trade tends to restrain her from taxing that of N.J. her interest opposed to it. Not interested in abatemts. nor common mass, but has espoused both (5)--urgent for vacant territory.  Delaware interested by her weakness in permant. reve. as tending to support the confederacy &--not materially by the credits of her Citizens. Opposed to abatements & common mass. To the vacant territory firmly attached.  Maryland having never been the seat of war & her citizens being creditors below her proportion is no otherwise interested in permant. reve. than in the support of Confederacy &c. Agst. abatements and--common mass. The vacant territory is her ruling object.  Virga. in common with the S. States interested by her opulent & defenceless commerce in a permt. reve. as tending to secure the protection of the Confederacy agst. the maritime superiority of E. States.   As it tends to discharge the loan-office debts & to restrain her from taxing the trade of N.C. justice & a liberal policy only recommend to her a permt. reve. It is uncertain how the credits of her Citizens may stand in a liquidation of their claims on U.S. Interested somewhat perhaps in abatements--particularly so in common mass--not only her excentric expenditures being enormous--but many of them which have been similar to those allowed to other states, having recd. no sanction of Congs. Her Cession will be considered as a sacrifice. North Carolina interested in permt. & genl. revenue as tending to prolong the protection of Confederacy agst. maritime superiority of E. States; and to guard her trade from taxation of Virga. & South Carolina. The loans of her Citizens are inconsiderable, but their claims for supplies must be great (6)--in abatements & in common mass essentially interested. In the article of territory wd. make a sacrifice.  S. Carolina being a weak & exposed State is interested in permt. reve. as tending to secure the protection of Confedcy. agst. enemies of every kind--also as to providing for debts, her Citizens having been lenders above her proportion & having besides immense unliqui-dated demands on U.S. as tending to restrain her to taxation of trade of N.C. a continentl. revenue not favorable to her supposed interest. In abatement & common mass she is supposed to be deeply interested, but in fact opposed to both--her sacrifice of territory wd. be inconsiderable.  Georgia as a feeble, opulent & frontier State peculiarly interested in whatever tends to support & prolong confederacy; also in permant. reve. by the credits of her Citizens; even those of the loan office being beyond her proportion. In abatements & in common mass deeply interested--in article of territory wd. make sacrifice.  To make this plan more effectuall for removing all present difficulties & occasions of future disputes, a recommendation is to be included for substituting numbers in place of the value of land as the rule of apportionment. In this all the States are interested, if proper deductions be made from the number of slaves.  ""

S. a duty of 5 Per Ct. ad valorem, at the time & place of importation, upon all goods, wares & merchandizes of foreign growth & manufactures, which may be imported into any of the said States, from any foreign port, island or plantation, except arms, armunition, cloathing, and other articles imported on account of the U.

S. for supporting the present war, nor be continued for a longer term than 25 years; and provided that the collectors of the said duties shall be appointed by the States within which their offices are to be respectively exercised, but when so appointed, shall be amenable to and removable by the U.

S., for supporting the present war, substantial and effectual revenues of such a nature as they may respectively judge most convenient, to the amount of and in the proportions following viz.(3) New Hampshire 80,000 Delaware 28,000 Massachusetts 320,000 Maryland 220,000 Rhode Island & Providence Virginia 290,000 plantations 48,000 No Carolina 148,000 Connecticut 222,000 So Carolina 120,000 N York 90,000 Georgia 24,000 N Jersey 110,000 2,000,000 Pennsylva 300,000 The said revenues to be collected by persons appointed as aforesaid, but to be carried to the separate credit of the States within which they shall be collected, and be liquidated and adjusted among the States according to the quotas which may from time to time be allotted to them.  (6) That an annual account of the proceeds and application of the aforementioned revenues shall be made out & transmitted to the several States, distinguishing the proceeds of each of the specifed articles, and the amount of the whole revenue received from each State.  (7) That none of the preceding resolutions shall take effect untill all of them shall be acceded to by every State, after which accession however, they shall be considered as forming a mutual compact among all the States, and shall be irrevocable by any one or more of them without the concurrence of the whole, or a majority, of the United States in Congs. assembled.(4)  (8) That, as a further mean, as well of hastening the extinguishment of the debts, as of establishing the harmony of the U. States, it be recommended to the States which have passed no acts towards complying with the resolutions of Congress of the 6th of Sepr. and the 10th of Octr. 1780, relative to territorial cessions, to make the liberal cessions therein recommended, & to the States which may have passed acts complying with the said resolutions in part only, to revise & complete such compliance. (9) That, in order to remove all objections against a retrospective application of the constitutional rule of proportioning to the several States the charges & expences which shall have been supplied for the common defence or general welfare, it be recommended to them to enable Congress to make such equitable exceptions and abatements as the particular circumstances of the States from time to time, during the war, may be found to require. (10) That conformably to the liberal principles on which these recommendations are founded, & with a view to a more amicable and complete adjustment of all accounts between the U. S. and individual   States, all reasonable expences which shall have been incurred by the States without the sanction of Congs., in their defence agst. or attack upon British or Savage enemies, either by sea or by land, and which shall be supported by satisfactory proofs, shall be considered as part of the common charges incident to the present war, and be allowed as such.

The Committee the next day reported on the subject of Finance--this by direction is now a secrecy, I hope ' twill be out timely to send it per post. I have had an interview with Dr Rush--but as he engages to write I shall refer to his Letter. The Assembly of this State, are entering on Measures for the relief of their own Creditors--and I observe the Mr. of C. from this S.(2) who were most zealous advocates for Continental Measures--have of late become more passive and upon the whole--Opposition to Court-measures, & men, seems to gain ground as fast as might be expected. Mr. Baily consented without hesitation to print what you requested.(3) He said your character stood Fair--and was daily rising in the eyes of the People of this City. I am told a pamphlet is now in the press, in favor of 5 per Ct. as soon as published will forward one. I conclude it to be the United efforts of A Junto--Mr. Carrol, Mr Madison, Mr Hamilton, Mr. Fitzsimmons--in doors--& the Supr. of F____ with his Assistant (4) out--may yet influence such Measures--as however agreable to others, must be reprobated by our State.  Yesterday's Paper (5) (inclosed) has an extract of a Letter from R.I. which must have been published with no very good intent that obliged me to present the Public with another--for Tuesday's Paper (6)--which I mean also to inclose. The paper of Feb. 1st I have not recd.(7) I shall if possible procure it--and get Cato inserted in the Papers of this City--agreable to your request. I think the difficulties which formerly subsisted on that head are pretty well over. The Sdt. of F____ seems greatly on the decline in the estimation of many, some late drafts for Acts &c. have been disgustful--especially one which is severely criticised, and the Arbitrary Principles it embraces, justly exposed in the Public Papers by Valerius.  I was told yesterday--that in New Jersey--a Certain Court favorite-- whom he had appointed to an Office in that State,(8) with a Modern Salary--was opposed by the people and threat'ned with immediate ruin, &c, if he attempted to Act--from which and other Circumstances, I am inclined to believe he was happy in forming some excuse for the resignation of an Office--which it was growing dangerous to hold--and as a prudent man foreseeing the evil he is willing to withdraw--& hide himself. That with him all who have been duped thro' weakness, or who from principles, have supported those unconstitutional propositions which have so long gulled & perplexed the public may shrink into obscurity--and the imperious tone of--By G__d you shall--be no longer heard in this Land of Liberty is my hearty prayer.  MARCH 8, 1783  You will long e' re this recieve the doings of Congress so far as was in my power to Communicate them.

You see I am punctual to your request. It gives me pleasure that I can return you satisfactory Answers--without sacrificing truth at the shrine of Adulation. March 10th.

This day we had another vote on the score of half pay--and Commutation--it was again negatived 12 States & 36 Members present.(11) We have a Long Letter this day from the Supr. of F. containing a Plan more in detail.(12) I wish the N England Convention, would be speedy in their movements, as the sense of the People there is now so generally known--some plan may be devised eligible and which when once well done would tend to supercede counter movements in Congress. I always was of Opinion something was necessary in Aid of \""dry taxation.\"" From a conviction by experience that the resources of which the States are really possessed could not be draw out in that way fast enough to keep pace with the public exigencies, & preserve its Credit but--why cannot Congress as well trust the States to Collect the Revenues--they may adopt--(when they have a right to coerce the payment of Constitutional requisitions) as the States trust Congress with Powers, which become formidable in Proportion as they are Concentrated? is a riddle to me.  I dare say no State has it in intention to rid itself of the Public debt without payment--therefore being left to Collect its own proportion it would be more likely to increase its exertions than otherwise.   I hope to hear from you at Hartford soon--and shall enclose your minutes Left for the report, you allude to,(13) in hopes it may refresh your Memory.

March 10th 1783 Your favour of 28th Jany dated at Guilford was recd by the Delegates from our State some days ago.(1) We had not the most distant Hope that there would have been a meeting of the Assembly in Jany knowing how greatly they had faild in making a House on their own adjournment. If they come with a hearty disposition to do business in the Spring we shall certainly propose work enough for them. A Particular Remark in your Letter on the Subject of Loans could not help to draw our Attention. You advise that we should borrow sparingly lest we be laid under too many obligations to our Allies. Do you think that we shall be tempted to make an extravagant Use of mony from the great abundance of it at a Time when we cannot even pay one Penny in the Shilling of the daily pay that is due to our brave but poor Officers and Soldiers. We have been able to borrow in all not from the govt of the united Netherlands, but from the Citizens of Holand, about 488 Thousand Dollars, And we have recd in Loan from France beside a small Sum that had been anticipated 344 Thousand Dollars for the service of the year 1782. The States were calld upon by Congress to raise 8 millions of Dlrs for the Expences of that year and they raised about the 20th Part of that mony. Would it not be supposed that our Army lived on Air like Camelions or that they had more Faith than other men ever possess'd: In a word we are often exhosted, if it can possibly be prevented not to risque another mutiny in the Army nor suffer them to disband when we are just in sight of the desired Prize, but it has seldom, I believe, been suspected that we borrowed without cogent necessity.  For several weeks we have not recd. a syllable of Intelligence from tother Side of the Atlantic and it is a matter of real consolation that the Enemy at New York are in the same situation. We presume that unexpected delays in setling Preliminaries occasion this absolute stopage of Vessels, for no mercantile Vessels in such Case will sail &  MARCH 11, 1783  the Official Dispatches are not ready. We are told that a Packet belonging to the United States in France has for several Weeks been held in hourly readiness for sailing.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia March 11th 1783 I informed you in my last that Morde[cai] Lewis and Compy. had discharged the bill drawn by Mr. Gough and that I had taken up your draught with Haym Solomons. I have yet only promises from Mr. Pollock.(1)  Congress have not come to any conclusion on the establishment of permanent funds. I have some reasons for believing they will this week: and that the duty of 5 per cent for twenty five years will be recommended to the States; the collectors to be appointed by the States amenable to and removeable by Congress.  General McDougal is still here waiting for a determination on the memorial of the army which considering the dispositions of some of the States seemed not to be favourable, tho' at present it is highly it will as Maryland and Delaware are represented.  On the question yesterday to agree to the report there were 8 States for, 3 against and 1 divided.(2) It is five months the 14th instant since we have received any dispatches from Europe, and all private accounts from any quarter are  MARCH 11, 1783  vague and not much depended on.

  Teusday. March 11 [1783]. The report entered on Friday the 7 of March was taken into consideration.(1) It had been sent by order of Congs. to the Supt. of Finance for his remarks which were also on the table.(2) These remarks were in substance; that it wd. be better to turn the 5 perCt. ad valorem into a Tariff founded on an enumeration of the several classes of imports; to which ought to [be] added a few articles of exports; that instead of an apportionment of the residue on the States, other general revenues, from a land tax, reduced to 1/4 of a dollar Per Hundred acres, with a house tax regulated by the number of windows, and an excise on all spirituous liquors to be collected at the place of distillery ought to be substituted and as well as the duties on trade made coexistent with the public debts; the whole to be collected by persons appd. by Congs. alone, And that an alternative ought to [be] held out to the States, either to establish these permanent revenues for the interest, or to comply with a constitutional demand of the principle within a very short period.  In order to ascertain the sense of Congs. on these ideas it was proposed that the following short questions sd. be taken:  1. Shall any taxes to operate generally throughout the States be recommended by Congs., other than duties on foreign commerce?  2. Shall the 5 perCt. advalorem be exchanged for a tariff? 3. Shall the alternative be adopted as proposed by the Superintendt. of Finance?  On the 1st question the States were, N. H. no, Mas. no, Cont. no, N. J. no, Maryd. no, Virga. no. 6 noes & 5 ays.(3)  On the 2d question there were 7 ays.  The 3d question was not put, its impropriety being generally proclaimed.  MARCH 11, 1783  In consequence of the 2d vote in favor of a tariff the 3 first paragraphs of the Rept. were recommitted together with the Letter from the Superintendt. of Finance.(4)  On the 4 par. on motion of Mr. Dyer, after the word \""war\"" in \""line 5\"" were inserted \""agreeably to the resolution of the 16. of Decemr. last.\""  A motion was made by Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Wilson to strike out the limitation of 25 years and to make the revenue coexistent with the debts. This question was lost, the States being N. H. no, Mas. no, Cont. divd, N.Y. ay, N.J. ay, Pa. ay, Del. ay, Maryd. ay, Va. no, N. C. ay, S. C. no.  A motion was made by Mr. Hamilton & Mr. Wilson to strike out the clauses relative to the appointment of Collectors, and to provide that the Collectors shd be inhabitants of the States within which they sd. collect; should be nominated by Congs. and appointed by the States, and in case such nomination should not be accepted or rejected within days (5) it should stand good.

  My dear Sir Philada. March 11th. 1783. Your favor of the 1st inst. came to hand yesterday but unaccom- panied by that of the preceding week referred to in it.(1) Another week has passed without affording the least relief from our suspence as to the progress of peace. At New York they are so much in the dark that their curiosity has recourse to the gleanings of the Philada. gazettes. The length of the negociation may be explained, but the delay of all parties to notify its progress is really astonishing. Our last official information is nearly 5 months old & that derived from the royal speech upwards of three months.  MARCH 11, 1783  The peremptory style & publication of Mr. M's letters (2) have {given offence to many without}(3) & {to some within Congress. His enemys of both} descriptions are {industrious in displaying their im}propriety. I wish {they had less handle for} the {purpose}. The plan before Congress for the arrangemt. of our affairs is to ask from the States a power to levy for a term not exceeding 25 years the 5 perCt. impost, with an additional impost on salt, wine, spirituous liquors, sugars & teas; to recommend to them to establish & appropriate permanent revenues for a like term for the deficiency; the proceeds to be carried to their credit; the whole to be collected by persons amenable to Congs. but appd. by the States; to complete the territorial cessions; to enable Congs. to make abatements in favor of suffering States; Congs. on their part declaring that all reasonable military expences separately incurred by the States without their sanction either by sea or land shall be part of the common mass; and proposing to the States a substitution of numbers in place of a valuation of land; Slaves to be equal to 1 free man.(4) The fate of this plan in Congs. is uncertain, & still more so among the States. It makes a decent provision for the public debts & seems to comprehend the most dangerous sources of future contests among ourselves. If the substance of it is rejected, and nothing better introduced in its place, I shall consider it as a melancholy proof that narrow & local views prevail over that liberal policy & those mutual concessions which our future tranquility and present reputation call for.  Mr. J____son (5) is still here, agitaded as you may suppose with the suspense in which he is kept. He is as anxious as myself for your going into the Legislature.

  My dear General March 11, 1783. In haste, let me tell you that as yet, no official dispatches have arrived, so that you must wait another post, for peace. Nothing has transpired from the other side of the water, either at Philadelphia or New York. Here we wait with anxiety for the stage from Elizabethtown, and at New York, the shores are crowded, the evening they are to hear from Phila.  Barney has been detained a long time by Doct. Franklin, to bring the dispatches to Congress, and what can detain him I cannot imagine; however, we shall have it together soon. This much assure yourself of in private, and as to my friend in Chatham, let him keep up his tobacco. There will be peace this boat; there are no objections of weight from this side of the water. What there are may delay, but cannot prevent. Such as they were, went by De Rochambeau. The British had, by an article in the treaty, gained a kind of naturalization for their merchants in our dominions. A reciprocity of this advantage was directed to be demanded, at all events, a free trade to their West India Islands--which it is probable will be conceded. However, this is entre nous. Adieu, John F. Mercer. I have bought a McFingal for you, but it is too large to send by post.(1) Whenever the official communication arrives, I will drop you a line by an express, that will instantly set out for Virginia.

 MARCH 12, 1783  Dear Sir, Philadelphia March 12th. 1783. I take the earliest opportunity of communicating the intelligence brought by Capt Barney. He brings us the preliminaries as settled between us & Britain, & which are to make a part of the definitive treaty when finished between the belligerent powers.(1) They acknowledge the Independance of the States--founded Nova Scotia & Canada agreeable to the treaty of Paris, give us a line from thence through all the northern lakes from thence to the head waters of the Massacipi, then down the waters of that river to Florida & then to the sea coast including all the isles within twenty leagues of our coast. This gives us a vast extent of country back not included within any of our States, names to us the navagation of those great lakes & of the fine river Massacipi, which we are to enjoy in common with them. We are to have equal priviledges in the fisheries, to take & cure fish on the uninhabited isles as usual, but if on the lands in a territory of either, the permission of the inhabitants to be obtained. All old Debts contracted before the war on either side to be paid. And our commissioners agee that Congress shall recommend to the different States to repeal their confiscatory laws, & to permit the offenders to come in & purchase of the holders by paying the real value of the consideration, they had paid for the property--that the property of British residents should also be restored, & that all others have the priviledge of staying one year to settle their affairs--that no more confiscations shall be made & no further prosecutions for offences hitherto committed. The whole of this you will observe is but a recommendation, which the wisdom of each State will not hesitate to reject, & only consented to, to gratify in appearance the foolish pride of Britain. The preliminaries give satisfaction, & come up to the full wish of every American. We had rather the mention of refugees had been omitted, but in fact it amounts to nothing as it stands, & is a mere finess to avoid doing any thing for them. Barney has a letter from Franklin as late as the 6th Jany. He left France the 17th Jany & his dispatches were made up the 1st & 14th Decemr. the Preliminaries signed the 30th Novr.(2) In Franklins letter to Barney he sais the negotiations seem further from a conclusion than they expected. The Count De Vergennes in his letter to Franklin inclosing dispatches to the French Minister here, sais that he still rather hopes that the Definitive treaty will be compleated.(3)  By all these you will find a peace still doubtful, & our hopes & fears not yet satisfied. Should tomorrows papers produce anything, I will send them to you; if the Preliminaries should not be published I will copy them & send them down.

The arrival of Captain Barney this morning creates so great a field for the circulation of reports agreeably to the complexion of the Reporter, that I have thought it not amiss to inform your Excellency of the substance of his dispatches, tho' you may perhaps receive it from other hands. He left L'Orient the 17th of January last. His latest dispatches are dated the 25th December. The Preliminaries between America and  MARCH 12, 1783  Great Britain were signed the 30th of November and contain nine articles, in substance as follows.(1) 1st. The acknowledgment of our Independence and the relinquishment of all rights, Claims &c. over us. 2dly. The Boundaries of the United States very Consonant to our Claim. 3d. A full and free right to the fisheries, with liberty to take fish on the several shores &c. 4. Creditors, on either side, to recover their just debts. 5. Congress to recommend the restoration of confiscated estates to British subjects, who have not born arms, and all others to be suffered to endeavour to prevail on the States to restore their property on their paying the bona fide purchase money paid by the Possessor. This indulgence to last 12 Months. 6th. No future prosecution for any past crimes and all present prosecutions to cease. 7. A firm peace, and hostilities to cease, on signing the Treaty. No plundering on the evacuation of Posts. All American Artillery to be left. All Prisoners of War to be set at liberty. All Archives, Deeds and papers taken by British Officers to be returned. 8. Navigation of Missisippi to be left open for both Nations. 9. Any place conquered by either party after the Articles shall arrive in America to be returned. As I have sketched out the substance of these Articles from hearing them read amidst a variety of papers and while attending to the duty of my office in Congress, your Excellency will see the impropriety of depending greatly on their accuracy or suffering them to be made public. The preliminaries are to take place on the Treaty between France and Great Britain being perfected, the principal articles of which were agreed on, and the negociation was going on when Capt. Barney left France, but not finished; and the Minister writes, that he rather thinks they will be soon finished.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia, March 12th, 1783 Congress have for some time past been employed in endeavoring to restore public credit, and to fall on some plan for doing justice to, and satisfying of our Army. And as it is not possible to obtain a sufficient sum of money in any reasonable time to answer the above purposes, it is concluded that there is no mode in the power of Congress, and the several States, but only to establish funds that will be adequate to the payment of the interest of all debts due from the United States. What will be the most proper articles to recommend to the States, on which to lay duties is now before us. Many things have been proposed, and many objections to each of them have been stated, and finally what we shall agree to, I am not able to even conjecture, (except that the impost of 5 per cent with a little variation, from what it was before, I believe will be one). We have had under consideration at the request from the Army a commutation for their half pay after the war; (1) we yesterday had the question after many days being spent thereon; it was lost by the vote of one single person: but I believe that it is a matter of so much consequence to the Army, that the person (after consideration) will bring on the matter again and give his assent to it; in that case it will be carried by nine States.(2) And if the Army agree to accept it, it will be  MARCH 12, 1783  funded and the interest yearly paid if the States will make the provision for that purpose, which I expect we shall soon recommend. I have for some time past been in hopes that I should have been able before this day to have congratulated your Excellency that a happy peace was actually concluded; but we are still in suspense, no news from Europe for this long time; what the difficulties are which prevents it, we are entirely at a loss. By Mr. Shattuck we rec'd Colo. Hay's order on Mr. Parker, which is accepted, and which I suppose will soon be paid; it is for two hundred pounds for Colo. Hamilton and myself; as I do not expect any more money from the State, I shall continue here as long as this will last, with what I have of my own, which will be but a few days longer. I hope, therefore, that one of my colleagues will soon come on to take my place. From your Excellency's most obedt. and humble Servt. Wm. Floyd.

Thro' the whole war he has made his public trust subservient to his private Speculation, & has thereby become as rich as a Jew. You wish to have some observations on the manners of this place. They are as little worthy of panygeric as an awkward imitation of the French can make them. Broke suddenly loose from the simplicity of quaker manners, dress & fashon & affecting the vanity, & nonsense, if nothing worse, of french parade, you may conceive they are more fit subjects of redicule than of admiration. Mr. Morris, Mr. Bingham, Mr. Ross & others, who have made large fortunes during this war, employ their wealth in a manner not very consistent with that un-ostentatious virtue which ought to animate an Infant republic. Extravagance, ostentation & dissipation distinguish what are calld the Ladies of the first rank. There are however exceptions, these being prudent, amiable & worthy persons of both Sexes. But the generality seem to be intoxicated with a sudden change of manners & unexpected elevation. I had not time to finish this Letter, being occupyed by attending to the Dispatches. The preliminary Articles are well enough, but being conditiond on the conclusion of Peace with France, which seems to me not probable this year; they still remain dependent on the issue of this campaign at least, which if very successful on the part of the Enemy may make them retract these conditions, & if ever so prosperous on the part of our Ally, we cannot hope for any thing better, as the latter seems more averse to our participation in the Fishery, & our possessing the western Country, than the English themselves are. We are placd in this uncomfortable situation, by the ambition of our Ally, And by the obligation our Alliance is supposd to have imposd upon us not to make Peace without their concurrence. My latest Letters give the most sanguine expectations of speedy peace.(3) But from reasoning on all circumstances it appears to me at least very doubtful. I wish most sincerely that peace may take place, & give us an opportunity of arranging our governments & Finances & of paying our Debts. I receivd the two Joe's you was so good as to send me for interest; & am very much obligd to you for your attention to my Affairs. When peace will permit the travelling in the extreme parts of your State, & I am freed from Congress, I shall revisit you, & take a view of the Country where the grant to me may be located. In the mean time I trust to your goodness & care to have the location made as advantageously as possible.(4) Mr. J. Adams is so persuaded, that Peace is settled that he has desird leave to resign & return home.(5) I am not of opinion that we can spare him yet. He & Mr. Jay have acted a spirited, independant, & therefore, in my judgment, a most laudable part; & will be necessary in Europe to counteract the treachery of old Franklin. I had drawn up a vote of thanks to Mr. Adams for the extraordinary Services he has renderd us   in Holland; but upon sounding I found the jealousy which Dr. F's friends, after his example, entertain of any approbation bestowd upon another, being a censure upon him, woud render the passage of it doubtful. It was therefore thought more prudent not to move it. There never I think existed a man more meanly envious & selfish than Dr. Franklin. The reason probably why it is not seen so as to make men dispise him is, that men in general listen much to professions, & look little to actions.(6) Mr. Adams has mentiond one mark of his tricking & selfish disposition. He obtaind a promise from Mr. Jay when at Madrid, to give his voice for appointing his Grandson W. T. Franklin, a young insignificant Boy as any in existence, to be Secretary to the Embassy for making Peace, who ought to be a person of consummate prudence, ability & worth. Upon this he appoints him to that office without consulting the other Commissioners.(7) Thus while Govr. Franklin is planning our destruction in London his Father & Son, are entrusted with all our Secrets in Paris. If it shoud be said that the establishd character of the old man will justify such a confidence; the same can not be urgd in favor of the young one, who is yet to be tried & has no character at all. I enclose you a Paper containing the preliminary Articles. With the most cordial remembrance of Mrs Warren's politeness & very agreable conversation, I beg you will present to her my best respects. My Nephew T. Shippen8 is equally pleasd with the Society at Milton & desires his respects. Farewell, A. Lee ""

  Sir, Philadelphia 12th March 1783. I sit down to mention the news of the day, which you will be pleased to communicate to our friends in Dover. Captain Barney arrived this day from France, under the protection of a passport signed by the British King, and brought the Preliminary Articles of Peace, signed by the Commissioners on the part of Great Britain and the United States of America, on the 30th November last. The Preamble sets forth that they are not to take effect 'till a Peace with France is concluded, and that they are to be included in, and make part of, the definitive Treaty. By the 1st Article, the King of G. Britain, acknowledges the United States of America to be free, independant and sovereign States, and for himself, his heirs and Successors, forever relinquishes all right and title to them. By the 2d the boundaries are fixed, to begin at the North West Angle of Nova Scotia, and run to the North West head of Connecticut River--then down the River to the 45th degree of North Latitude--then thro' the Lakes Ontario, Erie, Huron, Superiour, long Lake, and Lake of the Woods; and from the North West end of the latter a due West Course to the river Mississipi--then down that river to the 3lst degree of North Latitude--then to the river Apalachicola-- from thence to the Flint river--from thence to St. Mary's river, and down that river to the Atlantic Ocean. The line between New England and Nova Scotia to begin at the mouth of the river St. Croix, which empties into the Bay of Fundy, and run from thence to the first place of beginning, including all Islands within 20 leagues of the Land, except such as were formerly known to belong to Nova Scotia. By the 3d we have a right to fish on the Banks of Newfoundland, and to cure the fish on certain uninhabited islands. By the 4th Creditors in either Country are to be allowed to recover their just debts contracted before the year 1775. By the 5th Congress is to recommend to the Several States to restore confiscated property to real British subjects, and also to Persons resident within the British lines who have not borne Arms against the United States; and to suffer others of different descriptions to go into any of the States and remain 12 Months in order to endeavour to recover their property--to revise their Laws for Confiscation, so that the estates which have been sold may be restored to  MARCH 12, 1783  the former owners, they refunding the real value of the sums Actually paid for such estates. By the 6th there are to be no confiscations in future, nor any prosecutions for past offences. By the 7th Firm friendship is to be established--all Hostilities to cease--all prisoners set at liberty, and the British troops withdrawn as soon as possible, without destroying or carrying off property. American artillery to be left behind, and all Records which have fallen into the hands of their officers to be restored. By the 8th the Navigation of the river Missisippi is to be free to both Countries. By the 9th it is agreed that if any place should be conquer'd by either party from the other before the arrival of the Articles the same shall be restored. This Account is taken from short Notes made in Congress during the reading of the Articles, and therefore cannot be supposed to be very Accurate. I write it in haste in hopes of meetting with a conveyance this evening--if it should not go before to-morrow it may be accompanied with a News Paper. Please to present my Compliments to Dr. Tilton, and inform him that the Commutation of the officers half-pay was agitated in Congress on Monday last, and the question lost by the division of Connecticut.(1) I think it probable it will be brought on again in a few days. I am Sir, with much respect, your most obedient and most humble servt. E. McComb.(2) ""

  Wednesday 12, T.13, F.14, S.15 of March [1783]. These days were employed in reading the despatches brought on Wednesday morning by Capt. Barney commanding the Washington Packet. They were dated from Decr. 4 to 24 from the Ministers Plenipo. for peace, with journals of preceding transactions, and were accompanied by the Preliminary articles signed on the 30th of Novr. between the said Ministers & Mr. Oswald the British Minister.(1) MARCH 12, 1783  The terms granted to America appeared to Congs. on the whole extremely liberal. It was observed by several however that the stipulation obliging Congs. to recommend to the States a restitution of confiscated property, altho it could scarcely be understood that the States would comply, had the appearance of sacrificing the dignity of Congs. to the pride of the British King.(2) The separate & secret manner in which our Ministers had proceded with respect to France & the confidential manner with respect to the British Ministers affected different members of Congs. very differently. Many of the most judicious members thought they had all been in some measure ensnared by the dexterity of the British Minister,(3) and particularly disapproved of the conduct of Mr. Jay in submitting to the Enemy his jealousy of the French without even the knowledge of Dr. Franklin, and of the unguarded manner in which he, Mr. A. & Dr. F. had given in writing sentiments unfriendly to our Ally, and serving as weapons for the insidious policy of the Enemy. The separate article was most offensive, being considered as obtained by G. B. not for the sake of the territory ceded to her, but as a means of disuniting the U. S. & France, as inconsistent with the spirit of the Alliance, and a dishonorable departure from the candor, rectitude & plain dealing professed by Congs.(4) The dilemma in wch Congs. were placed was sorely felt. If they sd communicate to the F. Minister (5) every thing, they exposed their own Ministers, destroyed all confidence in them on the part of France, & might engage them in dangerous factions agst. Congs. which was the more to be apprehended, as the terms obtained by their management were popular in their nature. If Congs. sd. conceal everything, & the F. Court sd. either from the Enemy or otherwise come to the knowledge of it all confidence wd. be at an end between the allies; the enemy might be encouraged by it to make fresh experiments, & the public safety as well as the national honor be endangered. Upon the whole it was thought & observed by many that our Ministers particularly Mr. Jay, instead of making allowances for & affording facilities to France in her delicate situation between Spain & the U. S. had joined with the enemy in taking advantage of it to increase her perplexity; & that they had made the safety of their Country depend on the sincerity of Ld. Shelburne, who was suspected by all the world besides, and even by most of themselves. See Mr. L____'s letter Dcr. 24.(6) The displeasure of the French Court at the neglect of our Ministers to maintain a confidential intercourse & particularly to communicate the preliminary articles before they were signed, was not only signified to the Secty. of F. A. but to sundry members by the Chevr. de la Luzerne. To the former he shewed a letter from Ct. de Vergennes directing him to remonstrate to Congs. agst. the conduct of the Amr. Ministers; which a subsequent letter countermanded alledging that  Docr. F. had given some explanations that had been admitted; & told Mr. L. that the American Ministers had deceived him (de Vergennes) by telling him a few days before the preliminary articles were signed, that the agreement on them was at a distance; that when he carried the articles signed into Council, the King expressed great indignation, & asked if the Americans served him thus before peace was made, & whilst they were begging for aids, what was to be expected after peace &c. To several Members he mentioned that the King had been surprized & displeased & that he said he did not think he had such allies to deal with. To one of them who asked whether the Ct. of F. meant to complain of them to Congs. Mr. Marbois answered that Great powers never complained but that they felt & remembered. It did not appear from any circumstances that the separate article was known to the Court of F. or to the Chevr. de la Luzerne.(7) The publication of the preliminary articles excepting the separate article in the Newspapers was not a deliberate act of Congs. A hasty question for enjoining secresy on certain parts of the despaches which included these articles, was lost; and copies havg. been taken by members & some of them handed to the Delegates of the Pena. one of them reached the printer. When the publication appeared Congs. in general regretted it, not only as tending too much to lull the States, but as leading France into suspicions that Congs. favored the premature signature of the articles and were at least willing to remove in the minds of people the blame of delaying peace from G. B. to France.(8) ""

  My dear Sir, Philada. March 12. 1783 Capt. Barney commanding the American packet boat which has been long expected with official intelligence from our Ministers in Europe arrived here this morning.(1) He brings a supply of money the sum of which I cannot as yet specify & comes under a passport from the King of G. B. The despatches from our Ministers are dated the 5, 14 & 24 of Decr. Those of the 14th inclose a copy of the preliminary articles provisionally signed between the American & British Plenipotentiaries. The tenor of them is that the U.S. shall be acknowledged & treated with as free, sovereign & independt., that our boundaries shall begin at the mouth of St. Croix, run thence to the ridge dividing the waters of the Atlantic from those of St Laurence, thence to the head of Cont. river, thence down to 45° N. L. thence to Cadaraqui, thence thro' the middle of Lakes Ontario, Erie, Huron & Superior to Long Lake, to the lake of the woods & thence due W to the Mississippi, thence down the middle of the river to L. 31, thence to Apalichicola, to Flint river, to St. Mary's & down the same to the At- MARCH 12, 1783  lantic, that the fisheries shall be exercised nearly as formerly; that Congress shall earnestly recommend to the States a restitution of Confiscated property a permission to the refugees to come & remain for 1 year within the States to solicit restitution, and that in the most obnoxious cases restitution may be demanded of purchasers on reimbursing them the price of the property, that debts contracted prior to 1775 shall be mutually paid according to sterling value; that all prisoners shall be mutually set at liberty; troops withdrawn & all records & papers restored; that the navigation of the Mississippi from the source to the mouth shall be mutually free for the subjects of G. B. & the Citizens of America, a proposition comprehending the W. I. was offered on the subject of Commerce, but not admitted on the part of G. B. In the course of the negociation G. B. contended for not only the limits marked out in the Quebec Act, but all ungranted soil, for a contraction of the fisheries, and for absolute stipulations in favr. of the loyalists. The despatches of the 14th speak also of the principal preliminaries between F. & G. B. being settled; but of little progress being made in those between Hold. & Spn. & the latter; & of none between Spn. & U.S. A letter of the 24 Decr. from Dr. Franklin varies the scene somewhat. It says that uncertainties were arising from the unsettled state of minds in England & incloses a letter from Ct. de Vergennes observing that difficulties had arisen from the very facilities yielded on the part of France; & concluding with these words as well as I can recollect, \""Je ne desespere pas, J'espire plutÖt; mais tout est incertain.\"" Franklin's correspondence on this occasion denotes a vigor of intellect, which is astonishing at his age, a letter to the British Minister on the case of the Tories in particular is remarkable for strength of reasoning, of sentiment & of expression.(2) He concludes his letter to Congs. with observing that he is now entering on his 78th year, 50 of which have been spent in the public Service; and that having lived to see like Simeon of old the salvation of his Country, his prayer is that he may be permitted to retire from public life. Mr. Adams has also transmitted a resignation. The arrival of this intelligence will probably procure from Congs. some final decision with respect to Mr. Jefferson. Having given you all the facts which hurry wd. admit I leave you to your own conclusion as to the object of them. Farewell. J Ma[dison Jr.] ""

  Sir Phila. March 12th. 1783. We have judged it most advisable to communicate to your Excelly. by Express the purport of the dispat[c]hes from our Ministers at Paris, which have this day arrived by Capt. Barney, who left l'Orient the 17th of Jany. protected by a passport under the signature of his Brittanick Majesty, after having been long detained for the purpose of forwarding advices relative to the negociations for Peace. MARCH 12, 1783  These will be found important, altho' not decisive, & we consequently think it our duty, to furnish yr Excelly. with the information requisite to form your own judgement respecting the prospect we have of a speedy Peace, not doubting that you will so far diffuse communications (as may appear necessary) on a subject that must influence the measures of the Public & of individuals. The preliminary Articles of Peace were signed by Mr. Ozwald, Minister Plenipotentiary of Great Britain, & Messrs. Adams, Franklin. Jay & Adams, our Ministers--provisionally, that is to say, to be effective when the definitive treaty may be concluded between France & Great Britain. They are forwarded to us & contain 8 Articles, substantially of the following import. An ample recognition of the independance of the United States & relinquishment on the part of his Brittanick Majesty for himself, heirs & successors, of all claim to right of sovereignty, property or jurisdiction within the limits of the territory of the States, which are fully settled & described in the second Article. They are affixed much on the principle of the treaty of Paris, but to give you a more accurate idea without a minute detail, the line established, is from the mouth of the River St. Croix to the source, thence north along those mountains which divide the waters that fall on each side into the St. Lawrence & Atlantic Ocean, thence to the head of Connecticut River, thence down the middle of that River to the 45th degree of Latitude, thence west to the River Iroquois or Cataroquy, thence along the middle of the said River to the Lake Ontario, thence thro' the middle of that Lake & the Lakes Erie, Huron, Superior & the lake of the woods, pursuing the middle of their water communications, thence due west to the Mississippi, thence along the middle of that River to the 31 degree of North latitude, & thence from that intersection, nearly an East course to the source of St. Mary's River, thence down the middle of that River to the Atlantic Ocean, together with all Islands in sd. Ocean within 20 Leagues of the Continent. The great Fisheries to remain free to both nations, with liberty, to cure on the shores subject to either power, & we are also admitted to fish & cure on the shores of Labrador untill they may become settled. Debts due on both sides are to be recovered--no farther confiscations to take place & Congress are earnestly to recommend to the different States to revise those Laws, which forfeit the property of British subjects who have never born Arms against the United States, and all those refugees who have born Arms are to be permitted to make personal application to the different Legislatures to be reinvested, in their Estates on repaying any Sums which may have been bona fide paid by the present possessors. The subjects of either Power are reciprocally to enjoy in every commercial intercourse all advantages that the subjects of each respective   Power enjoy within their own dominions, saving the exclusive rights of the chartered Companies of Brittain, from an interference with which all other British subjects are precluded.(1) All posts within the territorial limits of the United States at present held by the British troops, are to be evacuated, without carrying any property which may have been seized from the Americans. All Posts taken since the signing of these Preliminaries to be immediately relinquished. These together with a general amnesty on both sides for all offences, & a ceasing of all criminal prosecutions arising on such offences, constitute the ground work of the agreement which has been thus reciprocally signed. On the 24th Doctr. Franklin writes that difficulties had intervened between that date & the 15th of Decr. when his last was dated accompanying the above in the prosecution of the Negociations between France & Great Britain.(2) It appears from the Journals of these negociations & the Letters of our Ministers previous to that date that the chief difficulty arose from Gibraltar. France had offered to give G. B. the Island of Guadaloupe for that post & to receive in return from Spain the half of St. Domingo, which belongs now to Spain but Britain obstinately contended for Porto Rico. However to give your Excellency a just idea of the present information of Congress on this subject, We transcribe to you quotations from a Letter from the Comte de Vergennes to Doctor Franklin, dated the 24th transmitted by him to Us. \""Our Negociations (i.e. between France & G. B) are at the same point with yours; but yet far from an end,\"" then again \""Our facility has occasioned difficulty\"" and again, \""I do not despair; I rather hope, yet every thing is uncertain.\"" On the whole I believe the preliminaries between France & Britain are agreed on tho' not signed (an account of them such as we have will be communicated in our next) & that Spain & Holland have made but little progress in their business. Thus far go the dispatches which we have already perused, matters of importance may yet be behind, & communications of very consequential import are expected from the Minister of France. If from these sources any intelligence may spring, yet unknown--Yr. Excellency may expect it by our next, which will follow this by an Opportunity that will give it a speedy & safe conveyance. A Copy of the Commission of his Swedish Majesty, to his Minister in France, empowering him to conclude a treaty with the United States, is now transmitted us.(3) The terms in which it is conceived are not only ample but honorary & flattering &c. We are happy to assure Yr. Excellency that some progress has been made in a treaty with that Power. We are assured that a deputation from the Refugees at N York are Sent to the legislature of that State requesting to know what terms they are to expect & every thing there portends a very speedy evacuation.  With high respect, We have the honor to be, Yr. Excellency's most ob. & very humble Servants. Jos. Jones Arthur Lee James Maddison John F. Mercer Theodorick Bland P. S. I find that the Article respecting Commerce altho' adjusted as above, yet was excluded by Mr. O. when about to sign, as several Acts of Parliament stand in the way.4 The Express who brings you this will apply to yr. Excellency for 24 -- which was the price stipulated, one third however will be repaid us by the Maryland Delegates. ""

  Dear Sir, In Congress Mar. 13th. 1783 In a Letter I recievd yesterday, dated Paris, Decr. 14 from a Gentleman exceedingly well acquainted with the Politics of St. James's,(1) is this passage--\""The acknowlegment of American Independency gives a right to Neutral Powers to trade directly to America. This will be a great advantage shoud the War continue, of which I think there is little probability. Europe seems to be in a disposition for Peace; & it is absolutely necessary for England.\"" This necessity of England, seems pretty clear from the King's Speech; & Mr. Jay writes that on the return of Count de Vergennes Secretary from London, whither Mr. Jay supposes he was sent to prevent the british Court from treating with us as an independent Nation, the Count told him he believd Ld. Shelburne was sincere in his desire of Peace.(2) If he is so, I am sure it must be from the necessity mentiond by my Correspondent, as I am persuaded that is not his inclination. So far the prospect is fair for Peace; but Count de Vergennes writes that tho' he has hopes, he has fears(3)--the preliminary Articles with France were not signed the 6th of Jany. Count d'Estaing & M. de la Fayette had saild for Cadiz apparently upon an expedition which woud hardly have taken place, if the Cabinet of France had not been determind upon a continuance of the war. MARCH 13, 1783  Our Dispatches mention that the british Commissioner made a proposition to ours, that we shoud agree not to molest their troops in their evacuation of N. York; which implies their wish of doing so; & the stipulation that if any place shoud have been taken by us between the signing the Conditional Articles & their arrival in America, it shoud be restord--seems to suppose that on such arrival hostilities shoud cease. There are many complaints of the most atrocious depredations of the Refugees on the shores of Potomac. These at least I presume the british Commander in Chief will now restrain, as being not only contrary to the pacific professions of his Master; but to the Laws of war among civilizd Nations. Congress have thought proper to enjoin secrecy with regard to communications of some of our Ministers, touching the conduct of the French Court during the negociation. What I have mentiond, relative to the mission of the Count's Secretary to London, is strictly speaking within that injunction. But I apprehend, the Secret will be at least as safe with your Excellency as with us; & it seems to me as necessary that you shoud be circumstantially informd.

March 13. 1783 We have recieved official Accounts of the Signature of the Preliminaries of Peace between Gt Britain & the United States to take Effect if the Affairs between France & Great Britain are adjusted. These Preliminaries contain everything we ought to wish. The Boundaries are eligible as we have the complete Navigation of the Lakes & that of the Missisippi our Lines running thro' those Waters. Our Fisheries are secured in the most ample Manner. There are some Articles which were inserted to serve british Pride wherein it is agreed that Congress shall earnestly recommend to the States the Revision of their Confiscation Laws & endeavour to bring about a Restoration of Property to those Loyalists who have not taken up Arms. But the States will be left of Course to their own Way of thinking as to Compliance with this Rec- MARCH 13, 1783  ommendation & this being the Case the Chance for the Adherents to their gracious Sovereign is but a blue one. The Preliminaries were signed the 30th of Novr. The Ship left France the 17th of January under a british Passport wherein the Word Rebel is omitted & we are stiled the United States. Tis signed by the King of the British Penitents. About 100,000 Crowns arrived in the Ship very opportunely Part of a Loan from France. The Affairs of a final Treaty were not brought to perfect Consistency, but every thing looks favourably & I believe in a Peace. You will no Doubt get particular Information from Head Quarters as the Secretary for foreign Affairs has wrote the General.(1) Yours afftely, R Peters [P.S.] The latest official Accounts we have are of the 25th Decr.

  Sir, Philadelpa. 13th March 1783 I recd. your Letter inclosing our Act of Assembly to secure literary Property. A Committee of Congress is Appointed to consider how literary Property shall be secured to the Authors who have not yet reported.(1) I wrote to Mr Ellsworth yesterday(2) by the Post informing him that Preliminary Articles of Peace had been agreed to and Signed between G Britain and America these will soon be published and Sent to the several States. N Scotia is limited by the River of St Croix so that Penobscot &c is retained by us. A Right to the Fishery is secured. Our Extent is from the North West Angle of N Scotia across the Keg Islands West to the head of Connecticut River, thence down the River to 45í N Lat. thence West to the River Iriquois--and to the middle of Antario, thence to the Waters which flow into this Lake from Eri, thence thro Eri, Huron, Michigan and Lake Superior, to the Lake of the Woods, thence West to Missisippi, thence down thro the middle of Missisippi to Lat 31--thence by the Southern Line of Georgia to the River St. Mary to the Ocean comprehending the Island belonging to the Coast. Some other particulars you will find in the enclosed Papers. I have recd. a Letter from Mr Lawrance(3) who gives me but little Incouragment to receive any Money from him--tho' he says what I beleive is true that he shall be glad to Oblidge Me. If I shall not be able to receive some of him, the Disappointment will be great and distressing--if you Shall know of any Oppertunity I wish that you would MARCH 14, 1783  procure an order and receive such money for me as you shall be able to get. The Policy of G Britain with Regard to America I beleive is totally changed. She probably will endeavour to accomedate herself to the Wishes of a People whom she has in Vain endeavored to conquer. But her Conduct has been so insidious that Notwithstanding the Strong Appearances to the contrary, We must be upon our Guard till Matters are settled and preserve good Faith with our allies. My Compliments to Mr. Ellsworth and Mr Lyman. I hope that Mr. Ellsworth will soon Return. You will keep up your Correspondence with Me and expect a punctual Answer to your Letters.

  Dear Sir Philadelphia, March 14. 1783 Though disagreeable to appear in any manner in a personal dispute, yet I cannot in justice to you refuse to comply with the request contained in your note.(1) I have delayed answering it to endeavour to recollect with more precision the time, place and circumstances of the conversation to which you allude. I cannot however remember with certainty more than this, that sometime in the campaign of seventy seven, at Head Quarters, in this state, you mentioned to Col Harrison, Col Tilghman, myself and I believe some other Gentlemen of General Washington's family, in a confidential way, that at some period in seventy six, I think after the American army had crossed the Delaware in its retreat, Mr. Reed had spoken to you in terms of great despondency respecting the American affairs and had intimated that he thought it time for Gentlemen to take care of themselves and that it was unwise any longer to follow the fortunes of a ruined cause, or something of a similar import. It runs in my mind that the expressions you declared to have been made use of by Mr. Reed were that he thought he ought no longer to \""risk his life and fortune with the shattered remains of a broken army\""; but it is the part of candour to observe that I am not able to distinguish with certainty whether the recollection I have of these words arises from the strong impression made by your declarations at the time, or from having heard them more than once repeated within a year past.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia March 17th. 1783. The Arrival of Capt. Barney in the Washington Packett, has afforded us, a large Budget of Intelligence & opened a new Scene in this Western World.(1) I have endeavoured to discover if any of the confidential Servants of Congress, have made it a Business to communicate freely to your Excellency the political State of our Affairs both at home & abroad, from time to time as they have turned up. The necessity of this Knowledge to one in your Excellency's responsible Situation, struck me as essentially necessary; but to my mortification, I cannot convince myself of the Certainty of this Measure, but am rather left in doubt. Conscious of my own want of both Time & Talents for so important a business, nothing but the necessity & usefulness of the work, could have tempted me to have troubled your Excellency with the essay at this critical Period, when perhaps unknown to me, some able Pen is engaged daily for the purpose. My present design therefore is, as an individual who has access to the Intelligence of Congress, and also the benefit of some private, confidential Communications, to give vour Excellency a short Compendium of the State of our Affairs in Europe, that you may he possessed of Facts necessary for your Station. As I act in this Business, but as an individual in a private Character, I shall combine the information obtained from the public dispatches, with that of private intelligence but of undoubted Authority. In the begining of the last Spring the Court of London being reduced to very disagreeable Circumstances occasioned as well by the State of her Finances, as by the Change of, and divisions in her Ministry, made some very distant movements to sound our Minister at Passy, relative to a separate Peace. Finding no incouragement on this Head, small beginings were soon ripened into a promissing Appear- MARCH 17, 1783  ance, by England authorizing Mr Grenville in due form, to treat with France &ca and giving instructions to Mr Oswald, a gentleman of great candour, Integrity & Abilities, (as is asserted by two of our Commissioners) to treet with Dr. Franklin. Great pains were taken to bring on negotiations in form, without farther express Powers with respect to America; our Commissioners resolutely determined to oppose every attempt to conduct the Business on a narrow Scale, tho' Count de Vergennes thought they might safely proceed on these limited Powers; however they refused to harken to any formal propositions, or rather refused to make any propositions of an explicit nature, untill the United States of America were expressly or implicitly acknowledged as independant States by Great Brittain and considered as one of the Nations of the Earth. In the Course of the Communications, our Commissioners convinced the Court of Great Brittain (at least in Appearance) of the great impolicy of their past Conduct, and of the absolute necessity they were under, of acting without delay on a more enlarged Scale, and by the generosity & Candor of their Behavior on this Occasion, to wipe away, the almost indelible Stain, of british Cruelty & Barbarism from the American Mind. This produced a Commission to Mr. Fitzgerald [i.e., Fitzherbert], to negotiate with France &c &c and another to Mr Oswald, to treat with america, wherein the Sovereignity & Independance of these united States are expressly acknowledged. Negotiations now took place in real Earnest between the Commissioners, whatever might have been the designs & dispositions of the Ministry of GB; as it clearly appears from our Ministers Letters that Mr. Oswald acted merely on the principles of a lover of Peace, being neither a creature or dependant of the Minister; and his honesty, candor & purity of Intentions, soon produced such a union of Sentiment, that an accomodation appeared to be fast ripening towards perfection. The principle points of discussion were, the Boundaries--The Fisheries--and the Tories. At first England appeared tenacious of the two first but were speedily convinced of their Error, and as to the last it rather appeared to be held up merely to save their national honor. Here it is said by some, that the Court of France took the Alarm at our extensive Claims on every Point, and began to fear lest the policy of England should grant to America too much. She see G Britain heartily repenting of her Folly, and all of a sudden putting about, and attempting to lay a Foundation for reconciliation with the United States, by granting all her reasonable Demands, with an appearance of Generosity. The ample Share in the Fisheries and our refusal to compensate or restore the Tories, gave her little Pleasure, and the extensive Claim of Territory, pleased her less but when she saw the possibility of Success on the part of our Commissioners, it is alledged, that she unhappily tarnished her Glory & reputation, by secretly sending Emissaries to England in order to foment divisions and pro-  mote suggestions of the unreasonableness of our propositions, and perswading that Court of the possibility of obtaining concessions on the part of America, far more advantagious than what was insisted upon. The british Ministry taking the advantage of these blunders of the Court of Versailles, instead of indeavouring to reduce the pretensions of America, candidly (in Appearance) communicated this conduct of France to our Commissioners and thereby created a Jealousy in their Minds agt that Court, as insidious & inimical. This perhaps might have too great an Effect, in alarming & souring the Minds of our Commissioners and it would not be unnatural to suppose, that it was greater than necessity dictated, when we consider the interest the Court of London had in exaggerating on the Occasion. The whole issued in our Commissioners signing the provisional Articles of Peace (a copy of which I shall endeavour to send herewith)(2) without the Knowledge of France, on the 30th Novr. and not till the next Day and after they were sent to the Court of London, were they anounced to Count De Vergennes, when he discovered great surprize, and covered his Chagrin by expressing his astonishment at our having obtained such advantagous Terms. Our public dispatches give us no Acct. of the Issue of the negotiations on the part of other belligerant Powers, except that some disputes had arose that delayed so desirable an Object, and suggesting doubts of the real desire of Great Brittain to do more then what was concluded with us, hoping to draw off the united States from the War, by putting them in a Situation, which would leave them nothing to contend for. But by a very confidential Letter from good, tho' private Hands of a later date it appears that the negotiations with France & Spain had gone on; and on this Authority I may almost venture to say, that I believe the Terms are fully digested, if not signed, between them. Spain insisted on the Cession of Gibraltar and offered to France, the spanish half of Hispaniola, if she would obtain Gibraltar for her at the Expence of France. Count De Vergennes thereupon offered to England the Island of Gaudalope in Exchange for that Rock, which was refused. She then added Dominica & the neutrality of St. Vincents. As this was the Ultimatum of France, it is supposed that it would be complied with. Holland demands three things--a restoration of her captured Possessions--Compensation for Damages unjustly sustained contrary to the Laws of Nations--and free navigation. A Commissioner is gone to Holland to settle these points, which are too unimportant to cause much difficulty, so that I hope a general Peace is not far off. But I do not mean by this, that there is so much certainty, as that any thing should be discontinued that is necessary for our defence. To be well prepared for War, is the surest way to make peace. A great deal has been suggested about the insidious Character of the English Minister, and that there is great reason to fear, as some think, by granting   America all that they have asked, the People here will never consent to a war being continued, in which they have no Interest, and that therefore her scheme is still to embarrass the definitive Treaty, especially as France will wish to prevent America from enjoying the Terms of the provisional Treaty. This Jealousy might be plausible, was not England in a Situation too critical to sport with such Important Matters. Her finances loudly call for an immediate Peace, being reduced (as her Commissioners acknowledged) to the necessity of stopping the Interest due on the national Debt, to carry on the war another Campaign in Case a Peace should not take Place. It is therefore on her real Interest, that I depend for the ratification of our Treaty & the Completion of that with the other belligerent Powers, in Case France is not so weak as to embarrass the Proceedings from an idle fear of America. Her Magnanimity, Generosity & Knowledge of her true Interest, have been so great & conspicuous, that I should feel severely hurt, should she tarnish her Glory at the last Hour. This I cannot believe, but will still hope for the best. There has been great Harmony between our Commissioners thro' out the Business. Mr Adams & Mr Laurens have resigned their Employments, intending to return immediately to America. In the Washington came over, 600,000 Liveres in Cash, part of 6 Millions obtained of the Court of France, instead of 20 Millions demanded. Thus I have in a hurry, given your Excellency a general State of the foreign Negotiations. I have done it in the most confidential Manner, knowing to whom I write, and that the utmost Care will be taken to preserve the Facts entirely to yourself. I have stated facts, but dare not to hazard Opinions. As I write in my private Character, your Excellency will not mention the Subject to me in your publick dispatches. I cannot help taking Notice, that the Ship Washington is the first American Vessel which ever had an English Passport, signed by the King's own Hand, and in which he certifies that she belongs to the United States of America. I need not to mention to your Excellency the present embarrassed situation of Congress. Perhaps there has not been a more critical, delicate & interesting Period during the War. Our Finances are in the most deplorable State, and it will take a considerable Time, before they can be replenished. Mr. Morris (on whom every disinterested, intelligent Member of Congress greatly relied) has resigned his Office, unless Conditions are complied with, which tho' reasonable in themselves, yet depend on very doubtful Events. Some difficulties of importance, attending the Etiquette of the Treaty in France (on which I may hereafter enlarge) give us great uneasiness and add much to our perplexity.  The Situation of our Army, as stated in your Excellency's Letter of last Wednesday,(3) by no means lessens our Anxiety & Mortification, especially as we have been for five or Six weeks, past, most faithfully & honestly engaged in laying a Foundation for their future Security, as well as making provision for a present Supply. More is not in our power, and I fondly hope that in this last hour, they will not dishonor themselves, and forfeit that Glory which they have supported with so much dignity to themselves & advantage to their Country. Violent Measures will certinly tend to prevent the Success of those Endeavours, Congress have been so laboriousty exerting, for their emolument & Security--and however they may think that they are the only sufferers, yet they may be assured, that our Shoulders are not free from the Burden. There is not a Man among them, who would envy us our Station, was he to be one week in Congress. Mrs. Boudinot & Miss Susan take this Opportunity of presenting their most affectionate respects and kindest Love & good Wishes to Mrs. Washington, whom they remember with the highest Sentiments of Esteem, in which may I be permitted most cordially to Join those of mine. I have the honor to be with the most profound respect, Your Excellency's Most Obedt. & afft. Hble Servt, Elias Boudinot P.S. By some Conversation I have Since had with the Minister of France, I find that the King his Master is greatly offended with our Commissioners, for signing the provisional Treaty without a confidential communication with his Ministers.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia, March 17th, 1783. Since writing to your Excellency by the last post in which I mentioned the Arrival of our packet from France with Dispatches,(1) and amongst other things the Articles to be Inserted in the Treaty for a General Peace (when that shall take place) as agreed to, and signed on the part of our Commissions and those of Great Britain, and as they are now made public I do my Self the pleasure to Inclose them to you. As to the Boundaries Contained in the Articles, they are not Quite so well in the Northwest part of the United States as we could wish, but I believe, and it is generally thought here, that they are as Exten- MARCH 17, 1783  sive as we had any Reason to Expect, Considering our Circumstances; as to the fishery, and the Navigation of the River Missipia, which are two very Important objects, they are settled to Satisfaction. As to the Articles Concerning the Tories, if it was Really Intended as it is Expressed, that Congress should Recommend to the Several States the Restoration of the Tory property (I mean If they should be serious in such a Recommendation, and the States should be serious in Complying with it) we should be Involved in very Great Difficulties Indeed; but I am Clearly of Opinion, and I believe most Every one here is of the Same, who have seen the Letters from our Ministers, that it was done in order that the king of Britain and his ministers might say to the Tories, that they had attended to their Interest as far as Lay in their power on the Settlement of a peace. Soon after the Negotiation was opened, Mr. Oswald among other things, proposed to our Commissioners, that the Tories should be Compensated for the Confiscations which had been made Among us. Our Ministers gave them for Answer, that it could not be done; that they had no power to agree to any such thing, nor had Congress any Authority to give them such powers; that it was a matter that Related Soally to the Internal Regulations of the Several States; that great part of the property was Alienated and out of the possession of the public, and that it would be utterly impossible to Raise Taxes on a Country which had Suffered so much Distress; for the purpose of Compensating the authors of their Distresses. These Reasons appeared to satisfie Mr. Oswald so that he said no more on the Subject; but in the Course of the Negociations, he found it necessary to go to England, and after he Returned, he urged that an Article should be imported in favour of the Loyalists, and, Notwithstanding, our Ministers assured him that no advantage would arise to the Tories from it, yet he Insisted on it; they Informed him that if Congress should Recommend it to the States many months would elapse Before the Several Legislatures could meet on the Subject, and when they did, they would all Reject the propositions; but for some Reasons our Commissioners Agreed that it should be Inserted. On my Return from here, which will be in a few Days, I shall make a point of Seeing Governor Livingston for the purposes mentioned in Mr. Lhommedieu's Letter.(2) I shall not probably be here Long Enough to Receive a Letter from your Excellency after you have Recd this, But I shall write you on my way to the Northward. I would write to Mr. Lhommedieu, but Expect he will be gone to Connecticut before this Reaches you, I shall write to him in Connecticut by the next post. By my last Letter from Nicoll he mentions that his fever Continues on him and that he was in a very Low, weak State. I am under distressing Apprehensions for him.  Since writing the above, Colo. Hamilton has Concluded to Joyn me in Enclosing the Articles, and as we have But one printed Copy have Inclosed it in our Joynt letter.

  Sir, Philadelphia, March 17. 1783 I am duely honored with Your Excellency's letter of the 4th and 12th instant.(1) It is much to be regretted though not to be wondered at, that steps of so inflammatory a tendency have been taken in the army. Your Excellency has in my opinion acted wisely. The best way is ever not to attempt to stem a torrent but to divert it. I am happy to find You coincide in opinion with me on the conduct proper to be observed by yourself. I am persuaded more and more it is that which is most consistent with your own <<honor> reputation and the public safety. Our affairs wear a most serious aspect as well foreign as domestic. Before this gets to hand Your Excellency will probably have seen the provisional articles between Great Britain and these states. It might at first appearance be concluded that these will be the prelude to a general peace; but there are strong reasons to doubt the truth of such a conclusion. Obstacles may arise from different quarters, from the demands of Spain & Holl[and], from the hope in France of greater acquisitions in the East, and perhaps still more probab[ly] from the insincerity and duplicity of Lord Shelburn[e], whose politics founded in the peculiarity of his situa[tion], as well as in the character of the man will be suspected of insidiousness. I am really appr[ehensive] if peace does not take place, that the negotiation[s] will tend to sow distrusts among the allies and wea[ken] the force of the common league. We have I fear men [among] us and men in trust who have a hankering afte[r] British connection. We have others whose confidence in France savours of credulity. The intrigues of the former and the incautiousness of the latter may be both, though in different degrees, injurious to the American interests; and make it difficult for prudent men to steer a proper course. There are delicate circumstances with respect to the late foreign transactions which I am not at liberty to re- MARCH 17, 1783  veal; but which joined to our internal weaknesses, disorders, follies & prejudices make this country stand upon precarious ground. Some use perhaps may be made of these ideas to induce moderation in the army--an opinion that their country does not stand upon a secure footing will operate upon the patriotism of the officers against hazarding any domestic commotions. When I make these observations I cannot forbear adding that if no excesses take place I shall not be sorry that ill-humours have appeared. I shall not regret importunity, if temperate, from the army. There are good intentions in the Majority of Congress; but there is not sufficient wisdom or decision. There are dangerous prejudices in the particular states opposed to those measures which alone can give stability,  <<consistency, security > & prosperity to the Union. There is a fatal opposition to Continental views. Necessity alone can work a reform. But how <<is this > necessity <<to be produced>, how apply it, and how keep it within salutary bounds? I fear we have been contending for a <<bubble> shadow. The affair of accounts I considered as having been put on a satisfactory footing. The particular states have been required to settle 'till the first of August 80 and the Superintendant of Finance has been directed to take measures for settling since that period. I shall immediately see him on the subject. We have had Eight states and a half in favour of a commutation of the half pay for an aver[age] of ten years purchase--that is five years full pay instead of half pay for life, which on a calculation of annuities is nearly an equivalent. I hope this will now shortly take place. We have made considerable progress in a plan to be recommended to the several states for funding all the public debts including those of the army--which is certainly the only way to restore public credit and enable us to continue the war by borrowing abroad, if it should be necessary--to continue it. I omitted mentioning to Your Excellency that from European intelligence, there is great reason to believe at all events, peace or War, New York will be evacuated in the Spring. It will be a pity if any domestic disturbances should change the plans of the British Court. I have the honor to be, With the greatest respect, Yr Excellency's Most Obedt se[rvant] P.S. Your Excellency mentions that it has been surmised the plan in agitation was formed in Philadelphia--that combinations have been talked of between the public creditors and the army--and that members of Congress had incouraged the idea. This is partly true. I have myself urged in Congress the propriety of uniting the influence of the public creditors & the army as a part of them to prevail upon the states to enter into their views. I have expressed the same sentiments out of doors. <<Many> Several <<of the most sensible> other members of  Congress have done the same. The meaning however of all this was simply--that Congress should adopt such a plan as would embrace the relief of all the public creditors including the army; in order that the personal influence of some, the connections of others, and a sense of justice to the army as well as the apprehension of ill consequences might form a mass of influence in each state in favour of the measures of Congress. In this view, as I mentioned to Your Excellency in a former letter, I thought the discontents of the army might be turned to a good account. I am still of opinion that their earnest, but respectful applications for redress will have a good effect. As to any combination of Force it would only be productive of the horrors of a civil war, might end in the ruin of the Country & would certainly end in the ruin of the army. ""

A letter was rcd. from Genl Washington inclosing two anonymous & inflammatory exhortations to the army to assemble for the purpose of  MARCH 17, 1783  seeking by other means, that justice which their country shewed no disposition to afford them. The steps taken by the Genl. to avert the gathering storm & his professions of inflexible adherence to his duty to Congress & to his country, excited the most affectionate sentiments towards him.(1) By private letters from the army & other circumstances there appeared good ground for suspecting that the Civil Creditors were intriguing in order to inflame the army into such desperation as wd. produce a general provision for the public debts. These papers were committed to Mr. Gilman, Mr. Dyer, Mr. Clark, Mr. Rutlidge & Mr. Mercer.(2) The appt. of These gentlemen was brought about by a few members who wished to saddle with this embarrassment the men who had opposed the measures necessary for satisfying the army viz, the half pay & permanent funds, agst. one or other of which the individuals in question had voted. This alarming intelligence from the army added to the critical situation to wch our affairs in Europe were reduced by the variance of our ministers with our ally, and to the difficulty of establishing the means of fulfilling the Engagemts. & securing the harmony of the U.

  Sir. Philadelpa 17th March 1783. I have recd. your Favour of the 24th last by Mr Little. I had before by Letter informed you, that Mr Morriss promised me to write to a Mr Thompson of Boston, to Accept of the Office of Commissioner for Connecticut,(1) I beleive that he has not yet recd any Answer from him. The general Principles upon which the Accounts will be liquidated will be those established by Acts of Congress. I have not yet had an Oppertunity to forward a Sett of them to the Pay Table but will Attend to it, I wish that the Pay table could with more Accuracy than I think that they will be able to do, Ascertain the State Account, but it cannot be expected that they will be able to do this with Precision, til the Accounts of the U States are settled. I wrote to you the 13th instant, and shall now inclose to you a Copy of the Preliminary Articles as agreed to and Signed. You will observe by the Papers which I also Send you, that the british Ministry do not agree wheither a permanent settlement is intended to be made with America conformable to those Articles in Case a Pacification shall not be effected between France and G Britain--certainly according to the Terms of the Treaty their Effect is as it ought to be, Suspended upon that Condition--and the future Conduct of G B in Regard to them will be governed by what they Shall apprehend will be a Matter of Policy. This Policy may probably direct them (as it seems to do) fully to gratify America, and depend upon Such advantages as may Result from it, and may hope that our want of System to regulate So Vast a  MARCH 18, 1783  Country may render us very liable to the Impressions of their Councils, and Altho they may not expect to reastablish a political Relation with this Country, yet they may hope to recover in some degree those Affections which they have So wantonly lost, and that they Shall also finally recover Substantially the Benefits of Commerce--and induce us to place some Confidence in them. But it is but to little purpose to indulge ourselves in Conjectures upon the Subject when it will probably be so soon Ascertained whiether we shall have Peace or not. Upon Such an Event it is easy to be conceived that much must be done to put our Affairs upon a proper footing. Such a Territory has but rarely fallen to the Lot of one Nation. Some of the States are hesitating wheither they will grant a five per Cent Impost for National Purposes--but why will they hesitate? when the whole object of foreign Commerce ought to be under one Direction? I shall write to you or some of my Freinds by every Oppertunity, as I am sensible that you will wish for every Information at this important Period. I shall write no more to Mr Ellsworth as I Shall expect him here Very soon. I hope that he will not fail. You will present my Compliments to him, If he has not Set out on his Journey which I hope is the Case, and desire him in my name not to delay his coming forward.

  Sir Philadelphia March 18th 1783 Imediately on Congress recieving Authentick Intelligence of the Provisionary Treatys being agreed to & signed between His Britanic Majestys Commissioner & the Commissioners of the United States I  MARCH 18, 1783  transmitted to you an Account thereof,(1) but, then was not Able to give a Copy, which I now send you here Inclosed. The design, opperation & full Effect time will disclose. By the best Information we have recievd from our Commissioners at Paris the Prospects of a general Peace seem the most Probable, but it is possible we know that the Negociation still may break off, & whether the provisional agreement as it is Stiled will signifye any thing or not is left a doubt, & by the Debates in Parliament we find it is not fully agreed what Construction to give them. Since my last I had the Honor of Receiving your favor of the 24th Ulmo by Mr Little with its Inclosures relating specially to the affair of Mr Smith.(2) I was happy in recieving them, as much had been said upon the matter here & a Variety of reports were Circulating to cast an odium on the State, but I am ready Armd on all Occasions for its Defense. In Connecticut, a full hearing & Consideration by the Legislature and all things Considered it was Judged proper to recieve him with his Effects, here I find a Gentn. may have been gone 7 years to the West Indies in Constant trade from thence to Great Britain & now returnd with his Effects, & tho Publickly known, yet no notice taken of it, nor animadversions thereon; tho' I am not called upon to Judge of the propriety of the Resolutions of the Assembly on that affair, neither would it be proper for me to do it as I did not hear the Cause, Yet I am Clear that when the Assembly on full Consideration had permitted him to become a Subject of that State & to bring in his Effects, thereby such a Confidence must be placed in the State that it would be highly dishonorable for them to suffer Any persons in the State in Contempt of their Authority, to frustrate their Intentions, Violate their pledged protection, or pay any regard to the pretended Authority of a Neighbouring State to Protect them therein. I hope the tumult & Combinations referrd to in Govr Bowens Letter to your Excellency has Subsided, as we hear nothing further from either Rhodisland, or the Massachusetts, & that they will not be able to make any Impressions on Connecticut, tho when taxes press hard, and the prospects of success from our foreign Enemies Weakens & the common danger (the Strongest Cement to our Union) lessens, A large Debt Contracted both at home & Abroad, which must be paid tho gradually, our Army loudly calling upon us for Justice if not more, our Creditors Numerous & Clamourous, Our Credit sinking, our pledged faith failing, New dangers spring up from every quarter, States Jealous, people tumultuous, Counsels perplexed, then it is that the wi[s]dome & fortitude of those entrusted in publick affairs is brot to the Test, then they are called upon to exert themselves & with Patience and perseverance Indeavor to save the Sinking Ship tossed with Tempest, dashed with Angry Waves, suffering patiently ill report, keen reproaches, ingratitude & slander, Trusting in the supreme Governor of the Universe to direct the Storm, still the Waves, & Guide the Ship  into a Haven Calm & safe. When I am attending Congress the Demands of the Army are Continually pressing; Unable to Relieve them, the difficulties attending every State to Contend with & secure our own. If I could have every thing done in Congress according to my own mind & opinion it would be far from remeding all the Evils, or accomplishing the good Wished for, but the Variety of Interests As well as Conceptions of measures producing different opinions not only delay, but obstruct our proceedings & perplexes those concernd that the mind is Continually filled with anxiety tho not with dispair. If I was to return home, the Acting within a smaller sphere yet am sensible I should have the same difficulties to encounter Unless they should cast me over board as a Jonas to appease the Storm, which if it will, & save the Ship I think I should be Very Content. The Officers of the Army have had a Comtee or Agents attending here this 3 months, Not only to sollicit justice, pay or Security therefor (which Congress have been ready to Comply with to the Utmost of their power) but to enforce their half pay for life (which is their darling object) or what they now move for, a commutation for whole pay for a Term of Years after the Close of the War, to be Computed at equal Value. I was in hopes, & which seemd till late the disposition of Congress, to have referrd each line to their respective States for a Compensation, but it is represented by their Agents that the Army, especially the Connecticut line, are most averse to that, they think they have obtaind security from the States for their pay & depreciation & dare not or will not trust them for a further Compensation, their proposal on that head has met with dificulties in Congress, as it requires Nine States. 8 States & half Connecticut have agreed to it, but for reasons which I have & have offered I have been in the Negative(3) & which has hitherto stoppd the measure, New Hampshire, Rhodisland & Jerseys in the Negative,(4) tho I have proposed, if some alterations could be made in the formed resolve that might remove some special difficulties that now lyes in the way, that I would finally give my Vote for it as now the whole blame if any they say lyes upon me alone, against the Voice of 8 states & half Connecticut. We are lately Informed that the officers in the Army finding their measure obstructed on that Account have thrown out many Indecent threats, & a proposed Combination forming to carry their points & do themselves Justice as they call it with their Arms & at the Point of the Bayonet threaten not to disband even if Peace is established, but to make themselves a Compleat Compensation by force of Arms, & Judge for themselves. This has been often held out as an Argument boldly on the floor of Congress; They have a prudent & discreet General at Head, & a wise Providence which superintends, therefore fear ought not, & trust will not direct or Influence our Conduct, but the great principl[e]s of right & Justice lead us on our way.  I am Very glad our Assembly made a requesition of all our Civil list &c their salaries & expenditures.(5) It is preparing & hope will have a beneficial Effect. I think they are much too numerous and expensive & have not been wanting in my Indeavours to lessen all needless expenditures ever since I have been here, Indeed their numerous establishment has All been since I was last at Congress tho no doubt in part beneficial. We shall carefully attend to procure relief for the State of Connecticut on Account of their securities given to their line of the Army till Jany 1782 which I was in hopes of Preventing by my early information to the Assembly of what was done in Congress on that head. The Journals of Congress are now made out & printed to a late day which shall forward when Brown returns or put them up in a box or chest with Numerous papers which have lain here & been increasing ever since Congress set, & send them to Hartford when I return which expect if Providence permit may be the fore part of May, <<(i.e.) if money is sent me to clear out, otherwise must pawn my self here on expence of the State.> tho I fear the great & Important matters which ought to Command the utmost attention of Congress & which have been long pressing upon them will not be wholly got through by that time. All the N England states have been but a little while represented, some are going off soon, I never have as yet left the State unrepresented, it never needed representation more, nor a wiser nor firmer than at present. I sincerely wish it had been in my power to have done my Country more service. My Indeavors have not been wanting, nor Will, nor Inclination. I was about Closing my letter, but cannot omit suggesting some observations on our National Debt Contracted by a long tedious & expensive War. The Object to us was truly great & will so appear to the world in Suceeding ages & generations; our present prospects are fair (by the good hand of Providence) for Establishing that freedome & Independence we have been Contending for; & now we begin to repine at the Cost, & Wish we had died in Egypt. The Expence has been great but not equal to Britain our Enemy, or France our Ally; no doubt there has been in the Confusion much Waste, great loss by the Enemy by land & sea, in many instances profusion, imbezlements, frauds, Imprudent management &c &c. It is Incident to a State of War, & to which the most experienced Nations are Subject to, much more to one where everything was New, untried & unexperienced, but it is past & gone & now cannot be helped. What shall become of the honest Debts Contracted and due to the Army, & for their supplies? Shall we, or can we cancell them with a dash, and Implore Heaven for Success? No. Our Army say they will pay themselves & injured Inocence will raise its Crye against us, & Justice demand satisfaction. What shall we do? In the first place lessen all unnecessary expen-  ditures as fast as possible, ascertain our Debt to the line of Justice, & pay as fast as we can, but we cannot pay the Principal, then the call is Secure our Interest and then a person can transferr his Debt at any time if he wants it for or near the Value; this will satisfy the Army & other Creditors; but the Question is how shall that be done by direct taxes on each state, justly proportioned? The People have been so harrassed with taxes & Collectors, that they feel galled, fretted, Impatient, & many really unable to pay; must not a new mode then be adopted, which will leave every one pretty much at his Choice whether to pay or not? & when he does pay, not to know or feel it? By this is clearly seen is meant dutys or Impost on foreign trade or Importation to be paid by the Mercht in the first Instance, & then it must take its Chance. This is the mode projected, & for a limited time, & sacredly to be appropriated to the payment of Interest, & the Excess towards sinking the principal, the Debts made out & certifyd to each State, & a strict account yearly rendered of the Expenditure, Superfluous Articles or such as are mostly consumed by the rich & Wealthy to bear the greatest burthen. This is said in general to be the only plan which appears feasable; Congress have had this subject long under Consideration to be ripened for the Approbation of the several States, for it is they alone can give it its sanction & seal. I only give the Sketch. I now Inclose the articles referrd to agreed upon between the Commissioners of Britain & America, with Mr Morrises state of expenditures to 1782 and the remainder are making out to be soon transmitted. Am with the greatest esteem & respect your Excellys. most obedt Hle Sert, Elipht Dyer ""

  Sir, Philadelphia 18th March 1783. I should have done myself the honor of writing to your Excellency before now if my Colleague had not promised to communicate the intelligence received by Captain Barney,(1) and to forward a Letter ad- MARCH 18, 1783  dressed to you from the minister of France. I have so little to mention at this time that I am scarcely justifiable in troubling you with a Letter. The report of the day is that General Carleton has informed the loyalists that unless they take the advantage of the fleet soon to sail from New York he cannot promise them another opportunity. That, in consequence of this, near 500 families were preparing to depart: but perhaps the preliminary Articles, which allows them a residence of 12 Months, may prevent it at present. We are also informed that 60 Transports, with troops, have fallen down to the hook, suppos'd for the West Indies. A Minister from Holland is expected in a short time. There are great tumults in that Republic. A plot has been discovered for cutting off the Patriots, and there is a strong party for divesting the Prince Stadholder of all his authority. Since my coming to Town I have been informed that the remains of Colo. Haslet are interred in the Market Street Burying Ground,(2) within about 18 feet of the Wall of the Church. The spot is yet known, but will soon be forgotten unless it is perpetuated by something monumental. Would it not be proper for our State to pay respect to his Memory by ordering a Tomb Stone, at least, with a proper inscription, to be placed over his Grave? This would not Cost, in my opinion, more than ten pounds. If they chose to be more profuse, a monument might be placed against the wall of the Church, as plain, or as much ornamented as they pleased to order. Their Delegates in Congress would not think it a trouble to have their orders carried into execution. With respectful Compliments to your Lady and Family, I have the honor to be, Sir, your Excellency's most obt & humble Servt E. McComb. ""

  My Dear Philada. March 18. 1783 I recd. yesterday your favor of the 7 inst. together with that of the 22 Ulto. which ought to have been brought by the preceding mail.(1) I regret much the uncertainty which attends your going into the Legislature. Is it possible that the difference between the amt. of your salary from the State and of the profits from which your office excludes you can form an essential article in your pecuniary plans? I am far from being singular in supposing that the business on the opposite side would be a much more productive fund. My letter by Express communicated to you the outlines of the intelligence brought by Capt. Barney from our Ministers in Europe.(2) The tediousness of the Cypher does not permit me now to enter into detail. I can only add that notwithstanding the flattering aspect of the preliminary articles there are various circumstances which check our confidence in them, as there are some which will {detract from our joy}(3) if they should be {finally estableished}. To explain this it must suffice to observe that The latest letters from our Ministers express the greatest {jealousy of G B} and secondly that the situation of {France between} the {interfering claims of Spain} & {U S} to which may perhaps be added some particular {views of her own} having carried {her into a discountenance of} claims, the {suspicions of our ministers} on {that side} gave an opportunity to {British address to decoy them into a} degree {of confidence} which seems to leave their {own reputations} as well as the {safety of their country at the mercy of Shelburne}. In this {business Jay has taken the lead} & proceeded to {a length of which you} can {form little idea. Adams has followed with} cordiality. {Franklin has been dragged into it. Laurens} in his {separate letter} professes a {violent suspicion of G. B.} and {good will & confidence toward France}.(4) The {dilemma to which Congress are} reduced is {infinitely perplexing}. If {they abet the proceedings of their ministers all} confidence {with France is at an end} which in the event of {a renewal of the war must be dread}full as in {that of peace it may} be {dishonourable. If they avow the conduct of their ministers} by {their} usual {frankness of communication} the most serious {inconveniences} also {present} themselves. The torment of this {dilemma can not be justly conveyed} with{out a} full{er recital of facts than is permitted}. I wish you not to hazard even an interlined decypherment of those which I have deposited in your confidence. Despatches were yesterday recd. from Genl Washington which have {received} & {increased our apprehenseons on that side}.(5) There seems to be reason to {suspect that} the {intriegues of} the {civil creditors fan} the {discontents of} the {army. The conduct of Washington} does equal honor to {his prudence and to his virtue}. The state {of our foreign affairs and of the army} combined with the difficulty and uncertainty of providing for justice & for our finances & with the {approaching exit of Morris give a peculiar solemnity to} the {present moment}. God send us a Speedy & {honourable deliverance from every danger}. Pray hasten the new Cypher which you have promised. I have not yet perused your notes but thank you for them. Mr. J____n(6) is still left in dubio as to his destination. Before the next post the final decision of Congs. will probably take place. The paper inclosed to Mr. Ambler will give you the first part of the parliamentary debates, as the one herewith inclosed will the preliminary articles. The eagerness MARCH 18, 1783  of the opposition for them portends violent altercations. The liberality of the articles to the U.S. will probably be the ground of Attack from the old Ministry; the omission of Commerce that of Fox's division. Farewell. ""

  Sir, Philadelphia March 18th 1783.  We have the honor to forward the enclosed copy of the Provisional Treaty which we received this Morning from the Secretary of foreign affairs. A rough copy hastily made was sent by express last Wednesday Evening as far as Baltimore Town, from whence some Gentleman of that place was requested to give it a Speedy conveyance to your Excellency.(1) We are truly sorry to inform you that the discontents of our Army have risen to a very alarming height, in so much as to threaten fatal consequences. Anonymous addresses calculated to inflame the passions had been industriously & clandestinely circulated through the Army, calling a meeting at an appointed place on the 13th Inst. to devise a mode of redressing their own wrongs, while it was yet in their power, declaring at the same time that no reliance was to be placed in the justice of Congress, from whom their unavailing applications had met with only inattention or contempt. The General interposed his authority as soon as he was apprised of this dangerous proceeding, and in general orders reprobated the measure, though in very gentle terms, he proposed, instead of the 13th that the meeting should be on the 15th & then by deputies from the General, field Commissioned & Staff Officers to state their grievances.2 This proposition was acceeded to. The General hoped the step he had taken to dissipate a Cloud so hastily collected & which threatened to burst on a sudden, would meet the approbation of Congress, he has the best disposition to support their Authority with his whole influence & power; at the same time he relies on Congress taking the most efficacious & speedy measures their circumstances will admit of to comply with the reasonable claims of the Army. MARCH 18, 1783  The Bill for £300 which the Intendent gave Mr. Carroll reason to expect by the Post of last week, is not received, and when it is, will not be adequate to our claims or necessities.(3) The extravagance of living in this place & the great scarcity of Money said to be felt by all, by us in particular, reduce us to the distressing alternative, of leaving Congress or subsisting, at the expence of a Class of People who cannot afford to give a credit. We have the Honor to be, with great respect & esteem, your Excellency Mo. Hble servts. Tho. S. Lee Danl. Carroll Wm. Hemsley ""

  Dear Gentlemen: March 18th, 1783. I do not recollect writing you since the arrival of Capt. Barney. It was deemed proper by Congress to make the subtance of the communications received by him as public as possible, as well to give equal ground to retard the acts of speculation, as to satisfy the minds of the people at large, anxiously looking for peace. A letter of Mr. Laurens, of a date posterior to those of his colleagues,(1) conveys strong suspicions of the designs of the Court of London. He speaks of very late advices received thence, which impressed him with an idea that their plans was to disunite the belligerent powers--and he says that the spirit of the nation is high for the prosecution of the war against France. This minister's own reflections are wise, and merit great attention. He recommends ardently to adhere religiously to our engagements with France, whose views he could discover no reason to suspect, and cautions against trusting to our new and half made friends. The newspapers enclosed, which contain parliamentary debates,(2) discover an indecision even in the Cabinet Council of the King of Great Britain, as to the effect of the preliminaries signed with A., consequently we have to apprehend that the L[ord] Shelburne has not disclosed all his ultimate views, even to them--for if he had, they could not have disagreed. He who cannot trust his own friends must not expect that his enemies will trust him. MARCH 18, 1783  We have advices, which our official dispatches warrant the belief of, that France and England have signed. Upon the whole, if we have not peace, there has been a game played that will be the wonder of ages yet to come; however, I have great hopes and small fears. You will observe, that altho' what I communicate to you is not under a particular injunction of secrecy, yet anything almost is expected to be secret, until publication is ordered. You will, therefore, use every caution. With sincere esteem, I am, Dr. Gentlemen, Your friend, John F. Mercer. [P.S.] I am sorry to inform you, that an alarming confusion prevails in the army. I hope the wisdom and prudence of the General will prevent any ill effects.

  Dear Sir(1) Phila. Mar. 18th 17[83] I wrote you the substance of the dispatches recd. by Capt. Barney(2) & now enclose you papers which contain Parliamentary debates, which together with the import of a Letter recd. from Mr. Laurens, give much room to suspect the designs of the Court of London. The date of this letter is posterior to that of any from his Colleagues & he seems strongly impressed with an idea that Lord Shelburnes ultimate view is to disunite the belligerent Powers--& he says that the spirit of the Nation is high for the prosecution of the war agt. France. His reflections are wise & merit attention. He recommends ardently to adhere religiously to our engagements with France whose designs he has not the least cause to suspect, & cautions us agt. trusting new & half made friends. You will perceive that the Cabinet Council of the King of Great Britain are wholey undecided as to the effect of the Preliminary Articles signed with America--consequently we have to apprehend what Fox suggests that Ld. Shelburne has not yet disclos'd all. However we have reason to believe that France has signed too, & measures are taken to bring the Dutch in. Spain I believe is agreed & if a Peace does not actually take place, it will be the most unexampled train of Jesuitism ever exhibited to the World. MARCH 18, 1783  I meant in this to enclose you a state of our National Debt & to have wrote to you largely on a political subject which deserves your most critical Attention. I[n] yours to me you say--The confderation has pointed out the mode by which Congress are to raise money--true--then Congress to do Justice must demand of the States their proportion of the public Debt. Can they pay it. We shall all answer no: the thing is impossible. Is there any other mode by which Justice can be [done] to those who have furnished the means which ensured our Independance? Yes the establishment of certain appropria[ted] funds, scruple easy to be comprehended & the produce of which is certain for the payment of the interest, whenever the payment of an annual Interest, is so established, we can either borrow money to pay of[f] the principal of our Debt, or the person holding the Capital may dispose of it--untill this is done, those who have demands agt. the Public, have not recd. Justice & I fear unless they soon have some prospect, the consequences which will ensue will prove dangerous indeed. I do not wish that Congress should have the affixing those funds, the States may designate them, all but the duty on <<trade> imports which must be subjected to some general regulation or it will not be productive. Experience has taught us that whenever one state lays a duty on a certain Article a neighbouring State takes it off in order to draw the trade thither, thus counteracting forever each other--nothing coud be expected from the fund, wch if viewed in every light will be found the best calculated of any that can be devised to produce large sums in the correct mode. The United States have become generally & constitutionally bound to the individual creditor. You cannot then turn him over to any particular State, you may as well deny him the debt. We contracted with you who had ample power to engage the States generally--they will say--& it was on the fault of no one individual state. The Situation of Congress at Present is by no means enviable, placed in a responsible Situation, receiving repeated applications, painted in the most lively colours of distress, without the means of relieving--hemmed in on all sides with difficulties that appear insurmountable--they find the fatigue of Office aggravated by reproaches of those who have not on whom else to vent their spleen. The Army are in a Situation truly alarming & highly critical, & but for the pru[dence] & discretion of the Commander in chief, the [con]sequences woud perhaps prove a reiteration of those Calamities which have already desolated this Country. Our credit on which alone We coud borrow money in Europe to satisfy them--has failed entirely as soon as it was known that the 5 per Cent scheme had failed. Doctor Franklin writes us this & so does Mr. A. I am in hopes you will consider these things well & make up your mind agt. the next Session of Assembly, for I know the strength of  those who wish well to the Union & the true intrest of America will hardly bear down the local politics & prejudices of the many.

Be assured Sir that I esteem your Acquaintance as a valuable Acquisition and shall cultivate it, with the highest Satisfaction. Before the rect. of this, you will have recd the provisional Treaty of Peace with Great Britain. The Circumstances attending it, are not without embarrassments, as France, Spain & Holland are eventually to finish their Terms with England, before we can claim any benefit from this negotiation. By the debates in the Houses of Commons & Lords, it appears as if some of that Body would inculcate an Idea as if America would be bound in Case France refused their Terms. I hope no American will ever have an Idea of deserting France upon any Terms whatever that are inconsistant with good Faith. We wait the next arrivals with great Anxiety & Expectation. The Conduct of Mr. H____(2) is all of a piece--many People suspect the harshest Things of him. I had entertained the best Ideas of his Integrity, but I confess his late Conduct has stumbled me much--especially the publishing certain Extracts of public Letters which he gave his word should not be made publick by him. Let his Integrity be ever so great, he has been the means of giving these united States a Shock, she will feel for years to come, and which indeed I think threatens our Union more than all the Arms of G B.

  Dear Sir Philadelphia 19th March 1783. I wrote you the 11th ultimo,(1) but have not been favor'd with any from you. Congress have appointed a committee to prepare a recommendation to the several States to sit apart a day of fasting, humiliation & prayer, but I don't expect it will be finished so as to go by this post; Therefore I thought it adviseable to give you this notice.(2) I suppose before this comes to hand, you will be well acquainted with the late intelligence from Europe; we are still in expectation of more important news from that quarter. I must beg leave to refer you to the inclosed for the intelligence of the day. I am, with perfect respect, your most obedient ""

  Wednesday March 19 [1783]. A letter was read from the Superintendt. of Finance inclosing letters from Docr. Franklin accompd. with extracts from the Ct. de Vergennes relative to money-affairs, the Supt. thereupon declaring roundly that our credit was at an end & that no further pecuniary aids were to be expected from Europe.(1) Mr. Rutlidge denied these assertions & expressed some indignation at them. Mr. Bland said that as the Supt. was of this opinion it would be absurd for him to be Minister of Finance and moved that the come. on his motion for arranging the department might be instructed to report without loss of time.(2) This motion was negatived as censuring the Come. but it was understood to be the sense of Congs. that they sd. report. The order of the day viz the letter from the Secretary of F. A. was taken up.(3) Mr. Wolcot conceived it unnecessary to waste time on the subject as he presumed Congs. would never so far censure the Ministers who had obtained such terms for this Country, as to disavow their conduct. Mr. Clarke was decided agst. communicating the separate article,(4) which wd. be sacrificing meritorious Ministers, & wd. rather injure MARCH 19, 1783  than relieve our national honour. He admitted that the separate article put an advantage into the hands of the Enemy, but did not on the whole deem it of any very great consequence. He thought Congress ought to go no farther than to inform the Ministers that they were sorry for the necessity which had led them into the part they had taken, & to leave them to get rid of the embarrassmt. as to the separate article in such way as they sd. judge best. This expedient would save Congress & spare our Ministers who might have been governed by reasons not known to Congress. Mr. Mercer said that not meaning to give offence any where, he should speak his sentiments freely. He gave it as his clear & decided opinion that the Ministers had insulted Congress by sending them assertions without proof as reasons for violating their instructions, & throwing themselves into the confidence of G. B. He observed that France in order to make herself equal to the Enemy had been obliged to call for aid & had drawn Spain agst. her interest into the war: that it was not improbable that She had entered into some specific engagements for that purpose; that hence might be deduced the perplexity of her situation, of which advantage had been taken by G. B.--an advantage in which our Ministers had concurred for sowing jealousies between F. & U. S. & of which further advantage wd. be taken to alienate the minds of the people of this Country from their ally by presenting him as the obstacle to peace. The British Court he said havg gained this point may easily frustrate the negociation & renew the war agst. divided enemies. He approved of the conduct of the Count de Vergennes in promoting a treaty under the 1st Commission to Oswald as preferring the substance to the shadow & proceeding from a desire of peace. The conduct of our Ministers throughout, particularly in giving in writing every thing called for by British Ministers expressive of distrust of France was a mixture of follies which had no example, was a tragedy to America & a comedy to all the world beside. He felt inexpressible indignation at their meanly stooping as it were to lick the dust from the feet of a nation whose hands were still died with the blood of their fellow-citizens. He reprobated the chicane & low cunning wch. marked the journals transmitted to congress,(5) and contrasted them with the honesty & good faith which became all nations & particularly an infant republic. They proved that America had at once all the follies of youth and all the vices of old age: thinks it wd. [be] necessary to recall our Ministers: fears that France may be already acquainted with all the transactions of our Ministers, even with the separate article, & may be only awaiting the reception given to it by Congs. to see how far her hopes of cutting off the right arm of G. B. by supporting our revolution may have been well founded: and in case of our basely disappointing her, may league with our Enemy for our destruction and for a division of the spoils. He was aware of the   risks to which such a league wd. expose F. of finally losing her share, but supposed that the British Islands might be made hostages for her security. He said America was too prone to depreciate political merit, & to suspect where there was no danger: that the honor of the King of F. was dear to him, that he never wd. betray or injure us unless he sd. be provoked & justified by treachery on our part. For the present he acquiesced in the proposition of the Secy. of F. A. But when the question sd. come to be put, he sd. be for a much more decisive resolution. Mr. Rutlidge said he hoped the character of our ministers wd. not be affected, much less their recall produced by declamations agst. them: and that facts would be ascertained & stated before any decision sd. be passed: that the Ct. de Vergennes had expressly declared to our Ministers his desire that they might treat apart, alluded to & animadverted upon the instruction which sumbmitted them to French Councils; was of opinion that the separate article did not concern France & therefore there was no necessity for communicating it to her; & that as to Spain she deserved nothing at our hands, she had treated us in a manner that forfeited all claim to our good offices or our confidence, she had not as had been supposed entered into the present war as an ally to our ally and for our support; but as she herself had declared, as a principal & on her own account. He sd. he was for adhering religiously to the Spirit & letter of the treaty with France, that our Ministers had done so; & if recalled or censured for the part they had acted, he was sure no man of spirit would take their place. He concluded with moving that the letter from the Secy. for F. A. might be referred to a special comme. who might enquire into all the facts relative to the subject of it. Mr. Holten 2ded the motion.(6) Mr. Williamson was opposed to harsh treatment of Ministers who had shewn great ability. He said they had not infringed the Treaty, and as they had recd. the concurrence of the Ct. de Vergennes for treating apart, they had not in that respect violated their instruction. He proposed that Congress sd. express to the Ministers their concern at the separate article & leave them to get over the embarrassment as they shd. find best. Mr. Mercer in answer to Mr. Rutlidge said that his language with respect to the Ministers was justified by their refusal to obey instructions, censured wth. great warmth the servile confidence of Mr. Jay in particular in the British Ministers. He said the separate article was a reproach to our character, and that if Congress wd. not themselves disclose it he himself would disclose it to his Constituents who would disdain to be United with those who patronize such dishonorable proceedings. He was called to order by the Presidt. who said that the article in question was under an injunction of secresy & he cd. not permit the orders of the House to be trampled upon.(7)  Mr. Lee took notice that obligations in national affairs as well as others ought to be reciprocal & he did not know that France had ever bound herself to like engagements as to concert of negociation with those into which America had at different times been drawn. He thought it highly improper to censure Ministers who had negociated well, said that it was agreeable to practice & necessary to the end proposed, for Ministers in particular emergences to swerve from strict instructions. France he said wanted to sacrifice our interests to her own or to those of Spain, that the French answer to the British Memorial contained a passage which deserved attention on this subject. She answer'd the reproaches of perfidy contained in that Memorial by observing that obligations being reciprocal, a breach on one side absolved the other.(8) The Ct. de Vergennes he was sure was too much a master of negociation not to approve the management of our Ministers instead of condemning it. No man lamented more than he did any diminution of the confidence between this country & France, but if the misfortune should ensue it could not be denied that it originated with France, who has endeavoured to sacrifice our territorial rights, those very rights which by the Treaty she had guarantied to us. He wished the preliminary articles had not been signed without the knowledge of France but was persuaded that in whatever light she might view it, she was too sensible of the necessity of our Independence to her safety ever to abandon it. But let no censure fall on our Ministers who had upon the whole done what was best. He introduced the instruction of June 15, 1781,(9) proclaimed it to be the greatest opprobrium and stain to this Country which it had ever exposed itself to, & that it was in his judgment the true cause of that distrust & coldness which prevailed between our Ministers & the French Court, inasmuch as it could not be viewed by the former without irritation & disgust. He was not surprized that those who considered France as the Patron rather than the ally of this Country should be disposed to be obsequious to her, but he was not of that number. Mr. Hamilton urged the propriety of proceeding with coolness and circumspection. He thought it proper in order to form a right judgment of the conduct of our Ministers, that the views of the French & British Courts should be examined. He admitted it as not improbable that it had been the policy of France to procrastinate the definitive acknowledgmt. of our Independence on the part of G. B. in order to keep us more knit to herself & untill her own interests could be negociated. The arguments however urged by our Ministers on this subject, although strong, were not conclusive; as it was not certain, that this policy & not a desire of excluding obstacles to peace, had produced the opposition of the French Court to our demands. Caution & vigilance he thought were justified by the appearance & these alone. But compare this policy with that of G. B. survey the past cruelty & present  duplicity of her councils, behold her watching every occasion & trying every project for dissolving the honorable ties which bind the U. S. to their ally, & then say on which side our resentments & jealousies ought to lie. With respect to the instruction submitting our Ministers to the advice of France, he had disapproved it uniformly since it had come to his knowledge, but he had always judged it improper to repeal it. He disapproved also highly of the conduct of our Ministers in not shewing the preliminary articles to our Ally before they signed them, and still more so of their agreeing to the separate article. This conduct gave an advantage to the Enemy which they would not fail to improve for the purpose of inspiring France with indignation & distrust of the U. S. He did not apprehend (with Mr. Mercer) any danger of a coalition between F. & G. B. against America, but foresaw the destruction of mutual Confidence between F. & U. S. which wd. be likely to ensue, & the danger which would result from it in case the war should be continued. He observed that Spain was an unwise nation, her policy narrow & jealous, her King old, her Court divided & the heir apparent notoriously attached to G. B. From these circumstances he inferred an apprehension that when Spain sd. come to know the part taken by America with respect to her, a separate treaty of peace might be resorted to. He thought a middle course best with respect to our Ministers; that they ought to be commended in general, but that the communication of the separate article to take place. He observed that our Ministers were divided as to the policy of the Ct. of France, but that they all were agreed in the necessity of being on the watch against G. B. He apprehended that if the ministers were to be recalled or reprehended, that they would be disgusted & head & foment parties in this Country. He observed particularly with respect to Mr. Jay that altho' he was a man of profound sagacity & pure integrity, yet he was of a suspicious temper, & that this trait might explain the extraordinary jealousies which he professed. He finally proposed that the Ministers sd. be commended & the separate articles communicated.(10) This motion was 2ded by Mr. Osgood, as compared however with the proposition of the Secy. for F. A. and so far only as to be referred to a Committee. Mr. Peters favored a moderate course as most advisable. He thought it necessary that the separate art. sd. be communicated, but that it wd. be less painful to the feelings of the Ministers if the doing it was left to themselves; and was also in favor of giving the territory annexed by the separate art. to W[est] F[lorida] to such power as might be invested with that Colony in the Treaty of peace. Mr. Bland said he was glad that every one seemed at length to be struck with the impropriety of the instruction submitting our Ministers to the advice of the French Court. He represented it as the cause of all   our difficulties & moved that it might be referred to the come. with the several propositions which had been made. Mr. Lee 2ded the motion. Mr. Wilson objected to Mr. Blands motion as not being in order.(11) When moved in order perhaps he might not oppose the substance of it. He said he had never seen nor heard of the instruction it referred to untill this morning; and that it had really astonished him; that this Country ought to maintain an upright posture between all nations. But however objectionable this step might have been in Congs. the magninimity of our Ally in declining to obtrude his advice on our Ministers ought to have been a fresh motive, to their confidence and respect. Altho they deserve commendation in general for their services; in this respect they do not. He was [of the] opinion that the spirit of the treaty with France forbade the signing of the preliminary articles without her previous consent; and that the separate article ought to be disclosed; but as the merits of our Ministers entitled them to the mildest & most delicate mode in which it cd. be done, he wished the communication to be left to themselves as they wd. be the best judges of the explanation which ought to be made for the concealment; & their feelings wd. be less wounded than if it were made without their intervention. He observed that the separate article was not important in itself & became so only by the mysterious silence in which it was wrapt up. A candid and open declaration from our Ministers of the circumstances under which they acted & the necessity produced by them of pursuing the course marked out by the interest of their Country, wd. have been satisfactory to our ally, wd. have saved their own honor, and would have not endangered the objects for which they were negociating. Mr. Higginson contended that the facts stated by our Ministers justified the part they had taken. Mr. [Madison] expressed his surprise at the attempts made to fix the blame of all our embarrassments on the instruction of June 15, 1781, when it appeared that no use had been made of the power given by it to the Ct. of France, that our Ministers had construed it in such a way as to leave them at full liberty; and that no one in Congs. pretended to blame them on that acct. For himself he was persuaded that their construction was just; the advice of France having been made a guide to them only in cases where the question respected the concessions of the U.S. to G. B. necessary & proper for obtaining peace & an acknowledgt. of Indepe.; not where it respected concessions to other powers & for other purposes. He reminded Congress of the change which had taken place in our affairs since that instruction was passed, and remarked the probability that many who were now perhaps loudest in disclaiming, would under the circumstances of that period have been the foremost to adopt it.(12) He admitted that the change of circumstances had rendered it inapplicable, but thought an   express repeal of it might at this crisis at least have a bad effect. The instructions he observed for disregarding which our Ministers had been blamed, and which if obeyed would have prevented the dilemma now felt, were those which required them to act in concert & in confidence with our ally: & these instructions he said had been repeatedly confirmed in every stage of the revolution by unanimous votes of Congress;(13) Several of the gentlemen present (14) who now justified our Ministers having concurred in them, and one(15) of them, having penned two of the Acts, in one of which Congs. went farther than they had done in any preceding act; by declaring that they would not make peace untill the interests of our allies & friends as well as of the U. S. sd. be provided for. As to the propriety of communicating to our Ally the separate article, he thought it resulted clearly from considerations both of national honor & national security. He said that Congress having repeatedly assured their ally that they would take no step in a negociation but in concert & in confidence with him, and havg. even published to the world solemn declarations to the same effect, would if they abetted this concealment of their Ministers be considered by all nations as devoid of all constancy & good faith; unless a breach of these assurances & declarations cd. be justified by an absolute necessity or some perfidy on the part of France; that it was manifest no such necessity could be pleaded, & as to perfidy on the part of France, nothing but suspicious & equivocal circumstances had been quoted in evidence of it & even in these it appeared that our Ministers were divided; that the embarrassmt. in which France was placed by the interfering claims of Spain & the U. S. must have been foreseen by our Ministers, and that the impartial public would expect that instead of co-operating with G. B. in taking advantage of this embarrassment, they ought to have made every allowance & given every facility to it consistent with a regard to the rights of their Constituents; that admiting every fact alledged by our Ministers to be true, it could by no means be inferred that the opposition made by France to our claims, was the effect of any hostile or ambitious designs agst. them, or of any other design than that of reconciling them with those of Spain; that the hostile aspect wch. the separate art. as well as the concealment of it bore to Spain, would be regarded by the impartial world as a dishonorable alliance with our enemies against the interests of our friends; that notwithstanding the disappointments & even indignities which the U S. had recd from Spain it could neither be denied nor concealed that the former had derived many substantial advantages, from her taking part in the war & had even obtained some pecuniary aids; that the U. S. had made professions corresponding with these obligations; that they had testified the important light in which they considered the support resulting to their cause from the arms of Spain by the impor-  tunity with which they had courted her alliance, by the concessions with which they had offered to purchase it, and by the anxiety which they expressed at every appearance of her separate negociations for a peace with the common Enemy. That our national safety would be endangered by Congress making themselves a party to the concealment of the separate article, he thought could be questioned by no one. No definitive treaty of peace he observed had as yet taken place, the important articles between some of the belligerent parties had not even been adjusted, our insidious enemy was evidently labouring to sow dissentions among them, the incaution of our Ministers had but too much facilitated them between the U. S. and. France; a renewal of the war therefore in some form or other was still to be apprehended, & what would be our situation if France & Spain had no confidence in us: and what confidence could they have if we did not disclaim the policy which had been followed by our Ministers. He took notice of the intimation given by the British Minister to Mr. Adams of an intended expedition from N. York agst. W. Florida, as a proof of the illicit confidence into which our Ministers had been drawn, & urged the indispensable duty of Congs. to communicate it to those concerned in it. He hoped that if a Come. sd. be appd. for wch. however he saw no necessity that this wd. be included in their report & that their report wd. be made with as little delay as possible. In the event the Lettr. from Secy of F. A. with all the despatches & the several propositions which had been made, were committed to Mr. Wilson, Mr. Ghorum, Mr. Rutlidge, Mr. Clarke & Mr. Hamilton.(16) ""

  Thursday March 20. [1783] An instruction from the Legislature of Virga. to their Delegates agst. admitting into Treaty of peace any stipulation for restoring confiscated property was laid before Congress.(1) Also resolutions of the Executive Council of Penna. requesting the Delegates of that State to endeavor to obtain at least a reasonable term for making the payment of British debts stipulated in the preliminary articles lately recd. These papers were committed to Mr. Osgood, Mr. Mercer & Mr. Fitzimmons.(2) Mr. Dyer whose vote on the day of frustrated the commutation of the half pay made a proposition substantially the same wch. was committed. This seemed to be extorted from him by the critical state of our affairs, himself personally & his State being opposed to it.(3) The Motion of Mr. Hamilton on the journals was meant as a testimony on his part of the insufficiency of the report of the Come. as to the establishmt. of revenues, and as a final trial of the sense of Congs. with respect to the practicability & necessity of a general revenue equal to the public wants. The debates on it were cheifly a repetition of those used on former questions relative to that subject.(4) MARCH 21. 1783  Mr. Fitzimmons on this occasion declared that on mature reflection he was convinced that a complete general revenue was unattainable from the States, was impracticall in the hands of Congress, and that the modified provision reported by the Come. if established by the States wd. restore public credit among ourselves. He apprehended however that no limited funds wd. procure loans abroad, which wd. require funds commensurate to their duration.

  Sr Philadelphia March 22d 1783 That I have not availd myself of the liberty of writing to you, which your Excellency's request, when you left this place would have Autho- MARCH 22, 1783  rized me to take, has been owing in a great measure to the state of things, which offerd no subject sufficiently interesting to engage your attention; the Indulgence of Speculative opinions in Politics, concerning events that might take place, was in my view a field too wide even for Imagination to range in, much too Extensive of Course to be comprized within a letter. I nevertheless felt the Honor you did me Sr., in the proposal to open a correspondence in which I must be so great a gainer. Time, which brings all things to light, has in part unravelld the intriciate clue of Politics--And America begins to have a prospect of the end of those struggles in which You Sr. have born so distinguishd and disinterested a part. The Preliminary Articles between Great Britain and America points conclusively to the great objects for which the United efforts of these States have been so long exerted, opens a view of the System of Politics which that Court has adopted--and unfolds the Misteries of the Conduct which the Politic Carleton has observed ever since his last arrival in America. The Present British Ministry appear to see clearly the importance of appreciating the Confidence of the people of America. They have wisely therefore determined on Men and directed their measures to that end--the pacific and conciliatory measures adopted in America were to be the Harbingers of still greater Concessions in Europe, the one without the other would have been Abortive. They have at length discoverd the Value of our Connection with France--they feel the loss of us--they see the impossibility of recovering us--they have therefore bid for our future good Will. They have placed us in a Situation to know and feel our own Value--whatever may be their Idea of their offers and concessions it appears to me that their effects are irrevocable, and that the full stream of Independence will flow from them--no future declarations on their part, will or can do away our Independence in the Eye of every other power in Europe--the Justice of our Cause and of course the Injustice of theirs is tacitly acknowledged in every article of the treaty; but particularly in giving up the Idea of restitution to the Tories. The affixing the boundaries of the United States as stipulated in the Articles appears to me of great importance, as it amounts to a guarantee against the Claims of every other Power--those Boundaries, and the Navigation of the Missisipi having been guarantee'd to great Britain by the treaty of Paris, and no other Power could have ceded them to us--they have thus fairly said to the other powers of Europe--Who bids more? What now must be the Conduct of the court of France? will she say you have given America too much--no surely--this she cannot say without unfolding a declaration that the objects of the War which were specified in our treaties of Alliance & Commerce were not the real but only the Ostensible objects. I cannot suppose the good Faith or the Policy of that enlightend and generous court wd. hazard even the appearance of such an Idea being enter- MARCH 11, 1783  taind. Will she Insist on America continuing the War from a Principle of Gratitude for the aid she has received from her Ally during the War? On this Question--I wd. observe that America owes much to the assistance and support of France. But is her Gratitude to be Taxd for the payment of the debt? has not France received Principal and Interest for her aid, in the effectual dismemberment of the British Empire? Is not the first object of every independent State, gratitude to its own Citizens in the consideration of their welfare, their preservation, their Happiness, which most intimately concerns that government which they have establishd for those Ends alone? Would it therefore become America after having Explicitly declared the end and object of their Alliance in the 2d Article of the treaty, and enter'd into a Solemn Engagement for the Same purpose in the 8th Article of the treaty--that the principle of gratitude alone shd. lead them to Spill the Blood of their Citizens--to oppress them with a load of Taxes--to Sustain in her Bowels and on her Commerce all the Horrors of War for the purpose of acquiring or preserving the possessions of Spain, who has spurnd her offers of Connection--who has ever refused to acknowledge her a Nation. Those Considerations lead me Sr. to Conclude that the Wise and Politic Court of France will certainly close with such offers from that of Great Britain, as may be reasonable, and will Bring the War to a Happy Conclusion--and leave our ally in that Honorable and distinguishd Situation among nations, which her arms and her Magnanimous Councils in this Intricate War have so Justly entitled her to hold. viz the dispencer of liberty to an oppressed people and of Signal benefits to all her Allies, at the same time that she reaps the most capital advantages to herself and diminishes in so great a degree all those which her rival possesst over her previous to the commencement of the Present War. Thus Sr. have I unfolded to you my crude Ideas of our political Situation, at this important epoch, and with diffidence submit them to your superior judgment--you will find them purely dictated by my love to my native Country and a Zeal for its future and present happiness independent of every other consideration. I well know that no person exceeds yr. Excellency in those Sentiments, happy shall I be if mine coincide with yours--and still more so shd. they be honord with an elucidation by your more matured and perspicacious Judgment, for which I have ever entertaind the most unfeignd respect. I have I fear so far exceeded the bounds of your Patience as to prevent me at this time from saying any thing on the present Situation and prospects of our Internal Policy. The Steps we are persuing in Congress to Establish Public Credit, and call forth our resources will I hope prove effectual, and enable us to do Justice to the Merits of our Brave and Virtuous Army. This day has given us a Fresh Proof of their exalted Merit & Patriotism--it is with Pleasure I Inform Yr. Excellency--that your dispatches containing an account of their meritori-  ous conduct on a late occasion (1) arrived in Congress almost Simultaneously with the final Passage of some resolutions which had been prepared, and received the assent of Congress for the Commutation of the half Pay to the whole Army(2) the Particulars of which Yr.

  Saturday 22. March. [1783] A letter was recd. from Genl Washington inclosing his address to the convention of Officers with the result of their consultations.(1) This  MARCH 22, 1783  dissipation of the cloud which seemed to have been gathering afforded great pleasure on the whole to Congress; but it was observable that the part which the Genl. had found it necessary & thought it his duty to take, would give birth to events much more serious if they sd. not be obvious by the establishment of such funds as the Genl. as well as the army had declared to be necessary. The report of the come. on Mr. Dyer's motion in favor of a commutation for the half pay was agreed to. The preamble was objected to, but admitted at the entreaty of Mr. Dyer who supposed the considerations recited in it wd. tend to reconcile the State of Cont. to the measure.(2) The order passed for granting 35 licences for vessels belonging to Nantucket to secure the whaling vessels agst. the penalty for double papers. This order was in consequence of a deputation to Congs. representing the exposed situation of that island, the importance of the Whale fishery to the U. S. the danger of its being usurped by other nations & the concurrenc of the Enemy in neutralizing such a number of Vessels as wd. carry the fishery in an extent necessary for the support of the inhabitants.(3) The Come. to whom was referred the letter from the Secy. of F. A. with the foreign despatches &c reported(4) 1. That our Ministers be thanked for their zeal & services in negociating the preliminary articles. 2. that they be instructed to make a communication of the separate article to the Court of France in such way as would best get over the concealment. 3. that the Secy. of F. A. inform them that it is the wish of Congress that the preliminary articles had been communicated to the Court of France before they had been executed. Mr. Dyer said he was opposed to the whole report; that he fully approved of every step taken by our Ministers as well towards G. B. as towards France, that the separate article did not concern the interests of France & therefore could not involve the good faith of the U. S. Mr. Lee agreed fully with Mr. Dyer, said that a special report of facts ought to have [been] made as necessary for enabling Congs. to form a just opinion of the Conduct of the Ministers, and moved that the report might be recommitted. Mr. Wolcot 2ded the motion which was evidently made for the sole purpose of delay. It was opposed by Mr. Clarke, Mr. Wilson & Mr. Ghorum the 1st & last of whom had how- ever no objection to postponing; by Mr. Mercer who repeated his ab- horrence of the confidence shewn by our Ministers to those of G. B.(5) said that A.(6) was about to realize the case of those kicked down the ladder by wch. they had been elevated, & of the viper which was ready to destroy the family of the man in whose bosom it had been restored to life, observed that it was unwise to prefer G. B. to Spain as our Neig[h]bours in W. Florida.  Mr. Higgenson supported the sentiments of Mr. Lee, sd. that the Ct. de V. had released our Ministers & that he agreed with those who thought the instruction of June 15 cd. relate only to questions directly between G. B. & U. S. Mr. Holten thought there was no sufficient evidence for praise or blame; and that both ought to be suspended untill the true reasons sd. be stated by the Ministers. He supposed that the separate article had been made an ultimatum of the preliminaries by G. B. & that there might also be secret arts. between G. B. & F. If the latter were displeased he conceived that she wd. officially notify it. Mr. Rutlidge was agst. recommitting but for postponing. The motion for recomg. was disagreed to, but several States being for postponing, the vote was no index as to the main question.(7) It had been talked of among sundry members as very singular that the British Minister should have confided to Mr. Adams an intended expedition from N. Y. agst. W. Florida; as very reprehensible in the latter to become the depository of secrets hostile to the Friends of his Country, and that every motive of honor & prudence made it the duty of Congs. to impart the matter to the Spaniards. To this effect a motion was made by Mr. Mercer 2ded by [Madison]. But it being near the usual hour of adjournment, the house being agitated by the debates on the separate article: and a large proportion of member[s] predetermined agst. every measure wch. seemed in any manner to blame the Ministers; & the Eastern delegates in general extremely jealous of the honor of Mr. Adams, an adjournment was pressed & carried without any vote on the motion.

Your Excellency will give me the utmost credit, when I assure you, that it is with the most unfeigned Joy, that I congratulate your Excellency and the whole army on the confirmation of the signing of the definitive Treaty of peace, by all the belligerent powers, on the 2lst of January. This happy event has just been announced by an Express from on Board a Sloop of War in the River, dispatched by the Count D'Estaing and the Marquis de la Fayette from Cadiz on the 14th of February, in hopes that she might arrive before those sent from France and Britain.

I duly received your Excellency's letters by the Express, containing the proceedings of the Army which gave Congress and every Friend to the Army the highest satisfaction.(2) The commutation of the half pay was passed yesterday by nine States in Congress,(3) which adds greatly to our general Joy.

God knows whether I shall be able from the farrago of Politics which fill my brain to make out a little Chit Chat--or something else to entertain you with, but of this you may be assured that were I to fill the whole sheet with professions of the Sincerest love varied in as many Phases as wd. equal the variations of Shelin o Geirey(2)--it would not encrease the affection and love I have for you--which is of that truely sincere and constant kind that existed between Brother & Sister before any new modes were introduced, only that it is heightend by a sense of merit which I say without flattery rarely falls to the share of your Sex--to tell you the truth my dear Sister I am rather Proud of you. But with all this I cannot promise to write to you by every post. My time is so taken up--and I have so many correspondents that my station obliges me to write to it is impossible. I have however now the pleasure of congratulating you on a General Peace in Which America is one of the Contracting Parties. America is now free and Independant--and has taken her place formally among the Nations of the Earth--is recognized as a Sovereign Power. The King of great Britain has formally renounced all Claim to Sovereignty or territory within the United States which are bounded by Novascotia, the lakes, the Missisippi--and the Souther Boundaries of Georgia. The Navigation of the Missisipi is conceeded to us and the right of fishing. This day arrived a dispatch Vessel a  MARCH 24, 1783  french Sloop of War--from Cadix, sent by the Count D'Estaing at the request of the Marquis de La fayette, announcing that the Genl. treaty had been Signed on the 2lst of Jany. last--the terms of which from Memory are these: America independt., Fishery, navigation of Missisippi, France St. Lucie restored--Tobago--Gorie--all her possessions in the East Indies restored, that may have been taken--Establishments on the coast of Bengal, and the Peninsula in the East Indies. Great Britain St. Christophers, St. Vincent, Grenada restored in the W.I., Senegal on the African coast. Holland St. Eustatia, Birbice, Essquebo in the W.I. and all her Settlements in the E.I. except one. Spain Minorca and the two Floridas to the 32d degree of N. Latitude. Hostilities have ceased and the Vessel which brought over the dispatches, has brought orders from Ct. d'Estaing in the name and under the Authority of the King his Master, to inform all Vessels he shall meet thereof. Similar orders are this day Issued from Congress to the American Cruizers. These are Jarring and discordant Nations once more bought to shake hands--may we continue my dear Sister to have peace in our time, and to enjoy the fruits of our Virtue & perservance in happy domestic tranquility. You told me you were turnd Politician. You see I have given you a dash of them. You tell Patsy you shall go to Bermuda in the fall. I will not dissuade you from it--because I know not the Urgency of yr. motive--but at any rate I hope you will not go untill I see you. I wrote this day to Tucker a short letter which goes by express containing the abstract of the above glorious news. I think it wd. be prudent and now is the time for you to demand the return of that Part of the Tobo. (which has not been drawn for) which was to be restored in one month after demanded. It will certainly rise to a price much superior which was my original motive for not selling it hastily and for having that Clause Inserted--if my name is necessary to making it--you have my permission to make use of it.

  Monday March 24th. [1783] On the day preceding intelligence arrived which was this day laid before Congs. that the preliminaries for a general peace had been signed on the 20th of Jany. This intelligence was brought by a French cutter from Cadiz despatched by Ct. d'Estaing to notify the event to all vessels at sea, and engaged by the zeal of the Marquis de la Fayette to convey it to Congress. This confirmation of peace produced the greater joy, as the preceding delay, the cautions of Mr. Lauren's Letter of the 24 of Decr.(1) and the general suspicions of Ld. Shelburne's sincerity had rendered an immediate & general peace extremely problematical in the minds of many. A letter was recd. from Genl. Carlton thro' Genl. Washington inclosing a copy of the preliminary articles between G. B. & the U.S. with the separate article annexed.(2) Mr. Carroll after taking notice of the embarrassment under which Congs. were placed by the injunction of secrecy as to the separate article after it had probably been disclosed in Europe & it now appeared was known at N. York, called the attention of Congs. again to that subject. MARCH 24, 1783  Mr. Wolcot still contended that it would be premature to take any step relative to it, untill further communications should be recd. from our Ministers. Mr. Gilman being of the same opinion, moved that the business be postponed. Mr. Lee 2ded it. Mr. Wilson conceived it indispensably necessary that something should be done; that Congs. deceived themselves if they supposed that the separate art. was a secret at N. York after it had been announced to them from Sr. Guy Carlton. He professed a high respect for the character of the Ministers which had received fresh honor from the remarkable steadiness and great abilities displayed in the negociations, but that their conduct with respect to the separate article could not be justified. He did not consider it as any violation of the instruction of June 15th, 1781. The Ct. de Vergennes having happily released them from the obligation of it; But he considered it with the signing of the preliminaries secretly as a violation of the spirit of the Treaty of Alliance as well as of the unanimous professions to the Court of France, unanimous instructions to our Ministers, & unanimous declarations to the world, that nothing should be discussed towards peace but in confidence and in concert with our ally. He made great allowance for the ministers, saw how they were affected, and the reasons of it, but could not subscribe to the opinion that Congs. ought to pass over the separate article in the manner that had been urged. Congs. ought he said to disapprove of it in the softest terms that could be devised & at all events not to take part in its concealment. Mr. Bland treated the separate article with levity and ridicule; as in no respect concerning France, but Spain with whom we had nothing to do. Mr. Carroll thought that unless some thing expressive of our disapprobation of the article & of its concealment was done, that it would be an indelible stain on our character. Mr. Clarke contended that it was still improper to take any step, either for communicating officially, or for taking off the injunction of secresy, that the article concerned Spain, and not France, but that if it sd. be communicated to the latter she would hold herself bound to communicate it to the former that hence an embarrassment might ensue; that it was probably this consideration which led the Ministers to the concealment, and he thought they had acted right. He described the awkwardness attending a communication of it under present circumstances; remarking finally that nothing had been done contrary to the Treaty, and that we were in possession of sufficient(3) materials to justify the suspicions wch. had been manifested. Mr. Rutlidge was strenuous for postponing the subject, said that Congs. had no occasion to meddle with it, that the Ministers had done   right, that they had maintained the honor of the U. S. after Congress had given it up; that the manoeuvre practiced by them was common in all courts & was justifiable agst. Spain who alone was affected by it; that instructions ought to be disregarded whenever the public good required it; and that he himself would never be bound by them when he thought them improper. Mr. Mercer combated the dangerous tendency of the Doctrine maintained by Mr. R. with regard to instructions, and observed that the Delegates of Virga. havg been unanimously instructed not to conclude or discuss any Treaty of peace but in confidence & in concert with his M. C. M. he conceived himself as much bound as he was of himself inclined to disapprove every other mode of proceeding, and that he should call for the yeas & nays on the question for his justification to his constituents.4 Mr. Bland tartly said that he of course, was instructed as well as his colleague & sd. himself require the yeas & nays to justify an opposite conduct; that the instructions from his constituents went no farther than to prohibit any Treaty without the concurrence of our ally;(5) which prohibition had not been violated in the case before Congress. Mr. Lee was for postponing & burying in oblivion the whole transaction; he sd that delicacy to France required this; since if any thing should be done implying censure on our Ministers, it must & ought to be done in such a way, as to fall ultimately on France whose unfaithful conduct had produced & justified that of our Ministers. In all national intercourse he said a reciprocity was to be understood; and as France had not communicated her views & proceedings to the American Plenipotentiaries, the latter were not bound to communicate theirs. All instructions he conceived to be conditional in favor of the public good; and he cited the case mentioned by Sr. Wm. Temple in which the Dutch ministers concluded of themselves an act wch. required the previous sanction of all the members of the Republic.(6) Mr. Hamilton said that whilst he despised the man who wd. enslave himself to the policy even of our Friends, he could not but lament the overweening readiness which appeared in many, to suspect every thing on that side & to throw themselves into the bosom of our enemies. He urged the necessity of vindicating our public honor by renouncing that concealment to which it was the wish of so many to make us parties. Mr. Wilson in answer to Mr. Lee observed that the ease mentioned by Sr. Wm. T. was utterly inapplicable to the case in question; adding that the conduct of France had not on the principle of reciprocity justified our Ministers in signing the provisional preliminaries without her knowledge, no such step having been taken on her part. But whilst he found it to be his duty thus to note the faults of these gentle-  men, he with much greater pleasure gave them praise for their firmness in refusing to treat with the British Negociator until he had produced a proper commission, in contending for the fisheries, and in adhering to our western claims. Congress adjourned without any question.(7) ""

On the 6th of January a Committee from the army presented a Memorial to Congress, explaining many substantial grievances.2 A Copy is enclosed. We have promised but have not yet been able to pay them one months pay. After much time employed in discussing the subject of commutation for half pay, two days ago the question was fully agreed to by nine States. Promises even those which are spacious, are found by experience to be very light food. Our Army and all other public creditors wish for something more substantial, for whatever has been fabled concerning the Camelion, it is generally believed that no animal can live on the air. Money or good Securities are desire'd. We have neither. But securities may be given, that is to say, the debts may be funded. By good & permanent funds the credit of the United States would be restored. Perhaps there are no possible funds that would be pleasing to all. We have been attempting with much pains to fix on some mode by which the quota of the several States might be determined according to the 8th Article of the Confederation, i.e. according to the value of located Lands & their improvements. The Rule is good and plain but the question is extremely difficult; How shall the value be fixed? Let the appropriated Lands and their improvements be valued by the Inhabitants of the respective States and we have great reason to believe, from proofs before us, that the valuation would be unequal and unjust; for instance, The average value of lands as they are now rated for the purpose of taxation in the State of Virginia is one third higher than the value of Lands as they are rated in Pennsylvania though it is certain that Lands in Pennsylvania are at an average worth one third more than the Lands in Virginia. If such valuation should be made in fixing the continental Quota, Pennsylvania when compared with Virginia would not pay quite half the sum she ought to pay. We have many other Arguments which either prove the different frauds or the diversity of opinions respecting the value of Lands which prevail in different States. It is presumed that the valuation would be more uniform and just if it was made by a Set of Commissioners who should view all the lands and buildings in the United States. But there is reason to believe that such process, like estates entailed, would be perpetual and, it would be an even chance which would come first The fixing the quotas or the day of Judgment. The eastern States, who consider the valuation Scheme as impracticable, talk much of fixing the quota's according to the number of Inhabitants, making  considerable allowance for slaves. Some of them propose to exclude all Slaves under 16 Years, which would be rating two slaves for one free men. We presume that the Southern States would meet them upon this ground or even upon ground somwhat lower for the sake of preventing Jealousies, a Contention and delay but we fear that if an attempt should be made to alter or amend the mode of fixing the quota, those very men would again talk of a Slave being equal to a white man. The Plan which is now recommended to the States, the only one on which we could agree having regard to the Spirit of the confederation may probably lead us to value the Lands according to the number of Inhabitants, that is, to suppose that a thousand acres of Land which maintains ten families is worth Ten Times as much as a thousand acres which maintains only one family. As the valuation is to be made by a grand Committee consisting of a member from each State we presume that the several States will take care to be represented at that time. Congress has been attempting to modify the impost of 5 per Cent so as to make it acceptable to the States who have complained. In the mean while attempts have been made to lay a general Tax on Lands, houses &ca as you will see by the Journal No . We presume that no such Tax will be recommended to the States because we think that the States should be left to tax Lands & other permanent property in such manner and at such rates as they think best. On the 24th of January Mr. Morris who is financier, from a view of the bad State of our finances informed Congress that he proposed to resign. Congress however did not take any public notice of that communication, because they expected in a few weeks to be able to adopt a system of Finance which might revive public credit. Some weeks passed and nothing material could be done when a second Letter was received from the Financier, both of which he published without the previous knowledge of Congress.(3) A Copy is inclosed. The Letters certainly refer to a want of disposition in the States to provide funds, evidenced in the recent case of Rhode Island & Virginia, but they are Incautiously worded & might involve a suspicion that Congress or the States at large did not mean honestly. If public credit had been alive the publishing those Letters would have proved a sickening dose, but there are times when nothing can hurt. It has been hinted from different quarters that there is danger of our borrowing too much money. The whole sum that has been borrowed from the beginning of the war in France, Spain, or Holland does not amount to eight millions of Dollars, and by accounts received by the last packet we have great reason to believe that we shall not be able to borrow a single farthing more. Whether we shall submit to beg is another question. The Public Creditors, that is to say, the loan officers Certificates in the State of Pennsylvania have been extremely importunate for Payment. Their clamor orriginated last summer in the Stoppage of Inter-  est, which for some years had been paid in France on Certificates of a certain emission.When the fund was expended the interest ceased to be paid. On this occasion those creditors who had hitherto fared best became most troublesome; they attempted to acquire weight by associating with other creditors and by effecting Combinations in the different States. Some memorials in consequence have been received from different quarters, but they are not numerous. The complaints however of these people continue, they affect to be considered as a Species of creditors who have distinquished and exclusive claims. Their plea is that the Citizens of Pennsylvania have lent more money to the union than any other State and nearly as much as all the other States together. It was the fortune of these People to have the mint of the United States near them. As soon as a Dollar was cast they received it warm out of the press in payment for provisions or whatever they furnished for the army. This money was immediately converted into certificates of which they have received a considerable sum. But they do not willingly admit that our Citizens are quite as heavily loaded with receipts Notes or Certificates of a different kind, all of which they have received for services done or for property empressed or freely sold for the use of the army, and that the claim of one man for a thousand Dollars is exactly equal to the claim of another Man for the same amount without regard to the particular form or words on the Paper by which that claim is certified. With this belief however, Congress sometime ago recommended to the States to raise particular sums for paying the Interest of Liquidated Debts. Having mentioned the subject of liquidated Debts we cannot help recommending a steady attention on the part of our State to the Settlement of all Public accounts in order that we may be able to State on acct. against the United States. While the auditors are settling Public accounts in the Different States, we observe that frequent applications are made to Congress in behalf of Individuals for power or permission to settle their accounts in a particular manner. The States offer to charge themselves with some of those accounts getting Credit for the amount in their accts. with the United States. In all these cases we observe that the States shew a disposition to make a full allowance to their respective Citizens. We do not insinuate that any want of Justice has appeared in any of those applications, we only observe that some of the States seem very solicituous that their Citizens should have full credit for the value of their services and expenditures not only that they may be on a footing with other States, who may be expected to do the same thing, but because every State must in one place or another pay its quota of the Public Debt and such Quota or any other large Debt may be more easily and more profitably paid to the People within the State than to foreigners or people without the State. Suppose that in settling our public accounts we should cut of[f] three fourths of the  claims of our own Citizens and that instead of allowing them four millions for services and expenditures we should give them credit for one million, it would follow that instead of retaining the remaining three millions in the State we should be obliged to pay it or at least 13 fourteenths of it to people out of the State. And that in order to lessen the national debt three millions we should wrong our fellow Citizens out of that sum; one fourteenth part of which or very little more would fall to our debet as part of the national Debt. That is to say with the desire of saving one Shilling we Should throw away thirteen. We are confident that we shall not, either on this subject of accounts nor on any other occasion be understood to recommend dishonesty; that baneful Vice which Tarnishes every virtue that should adorn the mind or promote Society we only wish to recommend a dilegent attention to the Settlement of Public accounts and the Interest of our own Citizens so far as it may consist with strict Justice and good faith. On the 23d of January Congress ratified a Treaty of Amity and Commerce that had been agreed to by our Minister at the Hague with their high mightinesses the States General of the United Netherlands.(4) A Copy is inclosed. When our last accounts came away the States had in Contemplation the sending a minister to this Court. On the 30th of November our Ministers for negotiating Peace with England concluded and signed Preliminary articles, a Copy of which is enclosed. They are more favorable than we had reason to expect, but we have some reason to fear that they are not so favorable as some of the States had expected, but we are convinced from the Journal of our Ministers who have given us a detail of different events, during the negotiation, that it was not practicable to have obtained better Terms. The payment of British debts was long and obstinately refused, but the Merchants in general in England seemed to Interest themselves on this subject; they wish that all mercantile Contracts should be considered sacred; and the British Merchants are such a body as their Ministry are not willing to oppose. It appeared that without this article the Treaty could not go on. Our ministers could easily calculate that the amount was much less than the expence of another Campaighn, to say nothing of the additional loss we might Suffer. During the last Summer Congress had reiterated their Instructions to the Ministers for negotiating Peace, to contend to the last extremity for the Western Territory, for the newfoundland Fishery and its ap-pendages for the retention of Tory property and British Debts; however the Power or right of making Peace implies the means and when a Concession became absolutely necessary, it was made in course. The British Minister contended Long for the return of all Tories or refugees, a full act of Oblivion and restitution of their Property; he alledged that the Kings honor made this article necessary. Our Ministers had a natural reply. The Kings passions, cherished by the false-  hoods & frauds of Tories had continued the war & might prevent a Peace, but we should not accept Peace on the humiliating Terms of cherishing the Plunderes of our Property and murderers of our friends. It was fortunate that those Renegadoes had not so many substantial Friends in England as the Merchants had, else it is questioned what the consequence might have been. At present nothing is given them but the promise of a recommendation. Light food: however the reward is quite equal to the Service. Yesterday morning the Triumph a French Corvet arrived here in a short passage from Cadiz. By this vessel we have assurances that the preliminaries for a General Peace were signed by all the belligerent powers on the 20th January. On this fortunte & happy event we sincerely congratulate our fellow Citizens of North Carolina, that secures a perfect Peace on the most liberal Terms with the full injoyment of Liberty. May they continue to enjoy and deserve the blessing; It is the greatest that Heaven in its Bounty has ever bestowed on so large a Nation. We presume that Sir Guy Carlton has not yet received the Preliminaries of the General Peace, for he sent us Yesterday, and not sooner, the Copy he had received from England of the Preliminaries signed on the 30th of November.(5) Inclosed are the outlines of the General Terms of Pacification by which you will observe that we got a degree less on the Bank of the Mississipi than had been first marked off. The Marquis de la Fayette had prevailed on the Count d'Estaing to send the vessel mentioned, from the mere hope that she might chance to bring the first news of Peace. But you will observe by her pasport, a Copy of which is enclosed, that hostilities are to cease at whatever places she may touch immediately on her giving the notice. As we presume that we shall gain as much as the Enemy by this measure, we did not loose a minute in giving Sir Guy Carlton and Admiral Digby the proper Information; by this we hope that some Vessels and, what we value more, some lives may be saved. Attempts have lately been made to excite Sedition in our main army; anonimous, enflammatory papers were circulated by Persons unknown. The Commander in chief hearing of this measure called a meeting of the officers some days ago. The whole proceedings on this occasion will be laid before you in time, from which you will certainly infer that our Army consists of the best Citizens as well as the bravest soldiers that ever drew a Sword. Before we disband our army and make some other necessary arrangements for Peace some very interesting matters must be submitted to the States; for this reason we presume that another meeting of the General Assembly of North Carolina will be necessary at an early Day. We have the honor to be &ca, Hu Williamson Benjamin Hawkins (6)  ""

  Sir Philadelphia March 24th. 1783. We have the pleasure of congratulating your Excellency on the result of the Negociations in Europe, which have at length happily terminated in a general Pacification. The Triumph a french Sloop of War, commanded by the Chevalier du QuÉne, arriv'd here the last Evening, dispatchd from Cadiz the 14th of Feby by the Marquiss of Fayette & the Comte D'Estaign, on a supposition, which the event has justified, that she might reach America, before any Packett which shoud sail either from Brest or L'Orient. The orders of the Comte D'Estaign to the Ch. du QuÉne contain a proclamation of the cessation of Hostilities, & the communications from the Marquiss of Fayette, convey the heads of the Preliminary Articles of the General Peace, which were signed the 20th January at Paris. These leave the decisive terms respecting the United States as affixed by the partial Agreement between America & G. Britain (our southern boundary being restricted to the 32 degree). The other belligerent Powers are in general reinstated in those Possessions which they held previous to the War (with Exception) that G. Britain cedes to France, Tobago, St. Vincents & Senegal, who on her part recedes from her right to fish on great Part of the Coast, which she held by the treaty of 63. She cedes to Spain, The Floridas & Minorca, & retains Negapatam in the East Indies. If any thing can add to this happy event, it is that the late confusion in the Army, thro' the prudence of the Commander in chief, has terminated in a manner which reflects additional honor on that band of Patriots.

  Sr. [March 25, 1783](1) Many Events have lately occurrd which have occasiond me to trouble your Excelly. with my Correspondence of a Private nature. I now take the Liberty of Writing to you by desire of a Committe of which I have the Honor to be one, to whom your Very Interesting dispatches to Congress of the 15th of this month were committed.(2) You will without doubt have been informd Sr. & have received with Pleasure the Intelligence of the Vote for the Commutation having passd Congress the Same day on which Yr. Excellency's dispatches containing the truely sensible and Patriotic Resolutions of the Officers of the Army convened by Yr. Excellency's Authority were received.(3) On that happy event I most Cordially Congratulate you Sr. and my Quondam Brother officers. I think it must give the most sensible Pleasure to every Friend of this Country--that an event so interesting shd. take place at the very moment that a Certainty of Peace was announced-- MARCH 25, 1783  And that the Civil and Military at that Critical Juncture shd. so harmonize on the Capital object of their Wishes. This event will I trust Eradicate from the minds of every Generous & thinking Man in the United States in whatever station he may be every Vestige of Suspicion which those of an opposite Complexion might have endeavord to Implant. If my Conceptions of the Sense of Congress are right--I think I can assure Your Excellency--that all those Suspicions which may have been entertaind--of want of Gratitude to the Army or a desire to do them complete and ample Justice, are totally groundless. Your Excellency I hope knows too well my Candor to Imagine I wd attempt to deceive. If I have built my opinions (on this head) on an erroneous Idea of Congress, the Moment Such error is discoverd by me I shall think myself unpardonable not to disclose it. You Will perceive Sr. by the Enclosed Rough Copies No. 1 & 2 (4) which the Committe have had Under their Consideration what is their Sense and what they have reason to think is the sense of Congress. We have thought it necessary to make to you Sr. a Confidential communication of our Sentiments in hopes that you will favor us with your opinion thereon at large. Our doubt arises solely from this Consideration--viz that the Enormous Expence of keeping the whole Army in the field untill their \""Accounts are Liquidated--the Ballances accurately ascertaind, and Funds Established for the Payment,\"" would be productive of the most Ruinous Consequences to the United States--might occasion Clamors among the Citizens--Embarrass the measures which Congress mean to take and so effect their Finances as to render it impossible to comply with what the Army most desire viz a punctual discharge of the debt due to them, on settlement. Your Excellency will I think require no Argument to shew the force of these observations. I will say nothing of the effects which ever have and ever will arise from keeping a large Army in the Field in a state of Inactivity, without any other object to employ their minds on, than their past sufferings and present distresses a relief of which must be inevitably removed to a further distance by the very means they appear to point out to procure it. Altho the resolutions of the Army on the Address to them by Yr. Excellency are perfectly explicit and breathe the most entire confidence in the Justice of Congress and the Sincere Intentions of that Body towards them. Yet lest some latent Spark of Suspicion undiscoverd by the Convention shd. unexpectedly discover itself, and laying hold of an ambiguous Expression, or even the Silence of Congress on some material point--does not Yr. Excellency conceive an Explicit and full declaration of Congress not only of their Intentions to do Ample Justice but of the mode by which it is to be done as far as depends on them, will be proper? Shd. you Sr. think proper to offer any amendment to either  MARCH 25,1783  of the Enclosed resolutions or to start any new Idea--that may be thought more effectual than those they contain--you may be assured of their being laid before the Committe in the most Confidential manner and of receiving all possible attention.(5) Altho I write now at the request of the committe you will be pleased to consider this communication, as not of a Public or official nature and communicable only to those in whom the most entire confidence is reposed. I need not inform your Excelly. of the earnest desire which the Committe have to make their report on this Subject as speedily as possible as you are fully apprized of the necessity of it, renderd, in my opinion, the more necessary by the great and Glorious event which has been so lately Announced to us of a General Peace.

You will excuse Sr., the hasty manner in which this has been written--as a fear of loosing the opportunity by the Post has deprived me of the power of revising it.

The Marquis being at Cadiz nearly Ready to sail with the Count D'Estaing for the West Indies, on the Signing of the Articles at Paris, Express was sent to Cadiz to stop them, his Attention to and anxiety for this Country induced him to solicit the Count for a Vessel to bring us the Intelligence, which was readily Granted.

  Sir Phila. Mar 25th 1783 The inclosed(1) I write more in a public than in a private capacity. Here I write as a citizen zealous for the true happiness of this country--as a soldier who feels what is due to an army which has suffered everything and done much for the safety of America. I sincerly wish ingratitude was not so natural to the human heart as it is. I sincerely wish there were no seeds of it in those who direct the councils of the United States. But while I urge the army to moderation, and advise Your Excellency to take the direction of their discontents, and endeavour to confine them within the bounds of duty, I cannot as an hon[est] man conceal from you, that I am afraid their distrusts ha[ve] too much foundation. Republican jealousy has in it a principle of hostility to an army whatever be their merits, whatever be their claims to the gratitude of the community. It acknowleges their services with unwillingness and rewards them with reluctance. I see this temper, though smothered with great care, involuntarily breaking out upon too many occasions. I often feel a mortification, which it would be impolitic to express, that sets my passions at variance with my reason. Too many I perceive, if they could do it with safety or colour, would [be] glad to elude the just pretensions of the army. I hope [that] this is not the prevailing disposition. But supposing the Country ungrate[ful] what can the army do? It must submit to its hard f[ate]. To seek redress by its arms would end in its ruin. The ar[my] would moulder by its own weight and for want of the means of keeping together--the soldiery would abandon their MARCH 25, 1783  officers. There would be no chance of success without having recourse to means that would reverse our revolution. I make these observations not that I imagine Your Excellency can want motives to continue your influence in the path of moderation; but merely to show why I cannot myself enter into the views of coertion which some Gentlemen entertain--for I confess could force avail I should almost wish to see it employed. I have an indifferent opinion of the honesty of this country, and ill-forebodings as to its future system. Your Excellency will perceive I have written with sensations of chagrine and will make allowance for colouring; but the general picture is too true. God send us all more wisdom.

  Sir, Philadelphia, 25 of March 1783 I wrote to Your Excellency a day or two ago by express. Since that a Committee appointed on the communications from you have had a meeting, and find themselves embarrassed. They have requested me to communicate our embarrassments to you in confidence and to ask your private opinion. The army by their resolutions express an expectation that Congress will not disband them previous to a settlement of accounts and the establishment of funds. Congress may resolve upon the first; but the general opinion is that they cannot constitutionally declare the second. They have no right by the Confederation to demand funds, they can only recommend; and to determine that the army shall be continued in service 'till the states grant them, would be to determine that the whole present army, shall be a standing army during peace unless the states comply with the requisitions for funds. This it is supposed would excite the alarms and jealousies of the states and increase rather than lessen the opposition to the funding scheme. It is also observed that the longer the army is kept together, the more the payment of past dues is procrastinated, the abilities of the states being exhausted for their immediate support and a new debt every day incurred. It is further suggested that there is danger in keeping the army together, in a state of inactivity, and that a separation of the several lines would facilitate the settlement of accounts, diminish present expence and avoid the danger of union; it is added that the offi- MARCH 25, 1783  cers of each line, being on the spot, might by their own solicitations & those of their friends, forward the adoption of funds in the different states. A proposition will be transmitted to you by Colonel Bland in the form of a resolution to be adopted by Congress--framed upon the principles of the foregoing reasoning.(1) Another proposition is contained in the following resolution-- \""That the Commander in Chief be informed it is the intention of Congress to effect the settlement of the accounts of the respective lines previous to their reduction; and that Congress are doing, and will continue to do, everything in their power towards procuring satisfactory securities for what shall be found due on such settlement.\""(2) The scope of this Your Excellency will perceive without comment. I am to request you will favour me with your sentiments on both the propositions, and in general with your ideas of what had best be done with reference to the expectation expressed by the officers; taking into view the situation of Congress.(3) On one side the army expect they will not be disbanded 'till accounts are settled & funds established--on the other hand, they have no constitutional power of doing any thing more than to recommend funds, and are persuaded that these will meet with mountains of prejudice in some of the states. A considerable progress has been made in a plan for funding the public debts and it is to be hoped it will ere long go forth to the states, with every argument that can give it success.

Your favor of the 15th inst. was duly recd. yesterday.(1) Mine by yesterday's Express will have notified the consummation of our wishes by a settlement of the preliminaries of a general peace on the 20th. of Jany. The inclosed Gazette will add all the circumstances under which the happy event is brought to us--happy it may be indeed called whether we consider the immediate blessings which it confers, or the cruel distresses and embarrassments from w[hich it] saves us.(2) The pecuniary aid of France for the year 1783, had been unalterably limited to 6 Million of livres. The greatest part of this sum had been anticipated and how our army could have been kept together for three months is utterly beyond my solution. As it is, God only knows how the plans in agitation for satisfying their just expectations will terminate; or what will be the issue in case they should be abortive. The effects of the anonymous addresses mentioned in my last (3) on the irritable state of their minds, have been effectually obviat[ed by the] seasonable & judicious steps taken by the Commander in Ch[ief. Th]e manner however in which he found it necessary, and indeed felt it to be his duty, to espouse their interests enforces in the highest degree the establishment of adequate and certain revenues. The provision reported by a Committee on this subject and of which I sketched you the import, is still before Congress.(4) The past deliberations upon it do not with certainty prognosticate its fate. I fear it calls for more liberality & greater mutual confidence than will be found in the American Councils. MARCH 25, 1783  ""

  Dear Sir, Philada 25th March 1783 From the Length of a public Letter which is inclosed (1) with this you will presume it is at least probable that I am pretty well tyred with writing. I had written by last Post to Petersburg (2) & desired a gentleman there to keep an Express in readiness on the Arrival of the Post which set out from this to Day, that he might carry our Dispatches as far as Coll. Long's at Halifax. Our State Being one of the few who gave their Delegates no Instructions to hire Expresses at the public Expence, we thought that sending from Petersburg was sufficient at our private Expence. However a young gentleman from Flanders has just announced to us that he will set out to morrow morning by day light for S. Carolina & having led Horses expects to reach Chas Town in 17 days. He offers to carry our Letters, we thought such a Jehu was preferable to the Post as more Expeditious. Your Excellency recollects that by the dates of our Commissions our Seats are vacant in Congress on the 13th of May.(3) There are now 12 States represented, but Georgia is not of that number & we fear she may not be represented for some Time, by her absence the southern Interest is weakened. I need not inform you that the Business in Congress for some Time must be extremely difficult & interesting. Arrangements are to be made for a Peace Establishmt. and such Settlemt made if possible concerning past Transactions and the great debt contracted as may give general Content & secure that Union in Peace which has been so effectual in War. I foresee the difficulty of this Business & heartily wish that if mistakes are to be committed some Person was in my Place who can more easily make them acceptable to the State. I never feard a public Enemy half so much as I fear the Risque of political Blunders. Mr Hawkins and myself will be very anxious to know what the Assembly is engaged in as soon as a House is formed and Business is fully taken up. I presume the Election for public Officers may be between the 20th & 25th of April, in that Case an Account of it may reach us before the 12th of May. The Post which leaves Petersburg on Friday morning reaches this on the next Monday week. An Express from Hilsbro on Monday morning will easily reach Petersburg on Thursday Evening in Time to meet the Post. In this Case your Letters would reach us in 14 days. As soon as Congress receive their Official Accounts of Peace with the Definitive Articles & shall have confirmed the same, they shall be forwarded to you by Express.

  Sir(1) Philadelphia. 25 March 1783 When I wrote you my former Letters (2) in answer to that which I recd. from you I did not know that the Secretary at War had in Octr. informed Congress that a Brigadier ought to be appointed for the Connecticut Line.(3) I mention this Circumstance as the Secretary has shewn me a Letter from you to him wherein you mention that you had receved a Treatment which you had no Reason to expect and Mention that you had been informed from a Delegate in Congress that a Plan had been adopted by which you could not at present be promoted or words to this Effect. I have no copys of the Letters which I sent you upon this Subject, but so farr as I recollect I gave you a general Abstract of the Act of Congress respecting the Appointment of Brigadiers, and mentioned in general that this System had been adopted upon advice. I wish Sir to recal your Attention to the Tenor of my Letter, for altho you do not Suggest and I am confident that you never meant to Suggest that I had given you the least Intimation that I supposed that the Secretary at War had any unfreindly disposition towards you--yet as you mention to the Secretary that you had recd. Information upon this Subject from a Delegate in Congress and appear to be disappointed in your Expectations from him, an Opinion might in some measure be formed from these Circumstances that the Manner of my Writing to you had induced you to have the unfavourable Opinion which you Appear to entertain. As I know your Candor, I wish that you would State in your Letter to that which the Secretary tells Me he shall Send to you, wheither this Opinion has been founded upon any Suggestions of Mine, not that I doubt what your Answer will be, but to obviate any Misapprehensions. In my letter I believe that I was explicit in saying that I was perswaded that the Candor of the Secretary at War, his Friendship for you, and His Regard for the Merit of your Services,  MARCH 25, 1783  would dispose him to do every Thing in his Power which he consistently could, to gratify your Wishes. I am Very sorry Sir that you have not had that publick notice taken of your Services which I beleive that nothing but some particular Circumstances, totally unconnected with your own personal character, has prevented. In Justice to the Secretary at War I must say that I always considered him as a Gentleman impartial and candid in his Administration and I believe that he has not had any Design to do you an Injury. The Secretary at War never intimated to me that he imagined that I had wrote to you any Thing that was improper, but as such an Idea may possibly exist in his mind, if it does so, I wish that it was removed as I do not wish to have it thot that I meddle with a Department which does not belong to me. I congratulate you upon the Establishment of our independence and the Restoration of a general Peace, and hope that We shall soon hear that the Definitive Articles are signed by the belligerent Powers.

  Wednesday March 26. [1783](1) Communication was made thro' the Secy of F. A. by the Minister of France, as to the late negociation, from letters recd. by him from Ct. de Vergennes dated in Decr. last, & brought by the Washington packet.(2) This communication shewed though delicately that France was displeased with our Ministers for signing prely. arts. separately; that she had laboured by recommending mutual concessions to compromise disputes between Spain & the U. S., and that she was apprehensive that G. B. would hereafter, as they already had, endeavor to sow discords between them. It signified that the \""intimacy between our Ministers &. those of G. B.\"" furnished a handle for this purpose. Besides the public communication to Congress other parts of Letters from the Ct. de Vergennes were privately communicated to the Presidt. of Congs. & to sundry members, expressing more particularly the dissatisfaction of the Ct. of F. at the conduct of our Ministers; and urging the necessity of establishing permanent revenues for paying our debts & supporting a national character. The substance of these private communications as taken on the 23 instant by the President is as follows: Finance.(3) \""That the Ct.deVergennes was alarmed at the ex- travagant demands of Docr. F. in behalf of the U. S.; that he was surprized at the same time that the inhabitants paid so little attention to doing something for themselves: If they could not be brought to give adequate funds for their defence during a dangerous war, it was not likely that so desireable an end could be accomplished when their fears were allayed by a general peace, that this reasoning affected the credit of the U. S. and no one could be found who would risque their money under such circumstances; that the King would be glad to know what funds were provided for the security and payment of the 10 Million borrowed by him in Holland; that the Count de Vergennes hardly dared to report in favor of the U. S. to the King & Council, as money was so scarce that it would be with the greatest difficulty that even a small part of the requisition could be complied with. The causes of this scarcity were--a five year's war which had increased the expences of Government to an enormous amount--the exportation of large sums of specie to A. for the support & pay of both French & English armies--the loans to America--the stoppage of Bullion in S. America which prevented its flowing in the usual chan-nels.\""(4) A letter of later date added \""That he had received the Chevrs. letter of Ocr. and rejoiced to find that Congress had provided funds for their debts, which gave him great encouragemt. and had prevailed on the Comptroller General to join him in a report to his Majesty & Council for 6 Million of livres for MARCH 26, 1783  the U. S. to support the war, but assures the Chevalier de la Luzerne, that he must never again consent to a further application.\"" Negociations He complains of being treated withgreatindelicacy by the American Commissrs. they having signed the Treaty without any confidential communication--that had France treated America with the same indelicacy she might have signed herTreaty first as every thing between France & England was settled, but the King chose to keep faith with his allies, and therefore always refused to do any thing definitively, till all his allies were ready; that this conduct had delayed the definitive Treaty, England having considered herself as greatly strengthened by America; that Docr. Franklin waited on Ct. de Vergennes & acknowledged the indelicacy of their behavior & had prevailed on him to bury it in oblivion: that the English were endeavoring all in their power to sow seeds of discords between our Commissrs. & the Court of Spain, representing our claims to the Westward as extravagant and inadmissible--that it became Congress to be attentive to this business, & to prevent the ill effects that it might be attended with--that the King had informed the Court of Spain, that tho' he heartily wished that the U. S. might enjoy a cordial coalition with his Cat. Majesty, yet he should leave the whole affair entirely to the two States and not interfere otherwise than as by his counsel & advice when asked--that altho' the U. S. had not been so well treated by Spain as might have been expected, yet that his Majesty wished that America might reap the advantage of a beneficial Treaty with Spain-- That as the peace was not yet certain, it became all the powers at war, to be ready for a vigorous campaign, and hoped Congs. would exert themselves to aid the common cause by some offensive operations against the Enemy--but if the British should evacuate the U. S. the King earnestly hoped Congs. would take the most decided measures to prevent any intercourse with the British, and particularly in the way of merchandize or supplying them with provisions, wch. would prove of the most dangerous tendency to the campaign in the W. Indies-- that the British now had hopes of opening an extensive trade with America, tho' the war should continue, which if they should be disappointed in, might hasten the definitive Treaty, as it would raise a clamor among the people of England. \""The Chevr. added that as he had misinformed his Court with regard to Congs. having funded their debts, on which presumption, the 6 Milon. had been granted, he hoped Congs. would enable him in his next despatches to give some satisfactory account to his Court on this head.\"" ""

  Thursday Mar. 27. [1783](1) The 5 paragraph in the report on Revenue havg. been judged not sufficiently explicit, and recommitted to be made more so,(2) the following paragraph was recd. in its place viz \""That it be further recommended to the several States, to establish for a term limited to 25 years, and to appropriate\"" &c [to the word 2 Million of dollars annually], \""which proportions shall be fixed and equalized from time to time according to such rule as is or may be prescribed by the articles of Confederation: and in case the revenues so established and appropriated by any State shall at any time yield a sum exceeding its proportion, the excess shall be refunded to it, and in case the same shall be MARCH 26, 1783  found to be defective the immediate deficiency shall be made good as soon as possible, and a future deficiency guarded against by an enlargement of the Revenues established provided that untill the rule of the confederation can be applied, the proportions of the 2,000,000 of dollars aforesaid, shall be as follows: viz...\"" This amendment was accepted,(3) motion of Mr. Clark to restrain this apportionmt. in the first instance to the term of 2 years, being first negatived. He contended that a valuation of land would pro[ba]bly never take place, and that it was uncertain whether the rule of numbers wd. be substituted and therefore that the first apportionment might be continued throughout the 25 years, altho it must be founded on the present relative wealth of the States which would vary every year, in favor of those which are the least populous. This reasoning was not denied, but it was thought that such a limitation might leave an interval in which no apportionment wd. exist, when a confusion would proceed, & that an apprehension of it would destroy public Credit. A motion was made by Mr. Bland 2ded by Mr. Lee to go back to the first part of the report & instead of the words \""levy\"" an impost of 5 PerCt. to substitute the word \""collect\"" an impost &c.(4) It was urged in favor of this motion that the first word imported a Legislative idea, & the latter an executive only, and consequently the latter might be less obnoxious to the States. On the other side it was said that the States would be governed more by things than by terms; that if the meaning of both was the same, an alteration was unnecessary; that if not, as seemed to be the case, an alteration would be improper. It was particularly apprehended that if the term \""collect\"" were to be used, the States might fix themselves the mode of collection; whereas it was indispensable that Congs. sd. have that power as well that it might be varied from time to time as circumstances or experience sd. dictate, as that a uniformity might be observed throughout the States. On the motion of Mr. Clarke the negative was voted by a large Majority there being 4 ays only. On (8) parag. there was no argt. nor opposition. The (9) paragraph being considered by several as inaccurate in point of phraseology; a motion was made by [Madison] to postpone it to take into consideration the following to wit \""That in order to remove all objections against a retrospective application of the constitutional rule to the final apportionment on the several States, of the monies & supplies actually contributed in pursuance of requisitions of Congress, it be recommended to the States to enable the U. S. in Congs. assembd. to make such equitable abatements & alterations as the particular circumstances of the States from time to time during the war may require, and as will divide the burden of such actual contributions among them in proportion to their respective abilities at MARCH 27, 1783  the period at which they were made.\"" On a question for striking out, the original paragraph was agreed to without opposition. On the question to insert the amendment of Mr. M, the votes of the States were 5 ays--6 noes viz N.H. no--Cont. no--N.J. no, Delr. no, Maryd. no, S.C. no. The rest ay. On (10) paragraph relative to expences incurred by the States with out the sanction of Congs. Mr. Clarke exclaimed agst. the unreasonbleness of burdening the Union with all the extravagant expenditures of particular States: and moved that it might be struck out of the Report. Mr. Helmsly 2ded the motion. Mr. [Madison] said that the effects of rejecting this paragraph wd. be so extensive that a full consideration of it ought at least to preceede such a step, that the expences referred to in the paragraph were in part such as would have been previously sanctioned by Congs. if application cd. have been made; since similar ones had been so with respect to States within the vicinity of Congs. and therefore complaints of injustice would follow a refusal, that another part of the expences had been incurred in support of claims to the territory of which cessions were asked by Congs. and there[fore] these cd. not be expected, if the expences incident to them should be rejected; that it was probable if no previous assurance were given on this point, it would be made a condition by the States ceding, as the Cessions of territory would be made a condition by the States most anxious to obtain them; that by these mean[s] the whole plan would be either defeated, or the part thereof in question be ultimately forced on Congs. whilst they might with a good grace yield it in the first instance; not to mention that these unliquidated & unallowed claims would produce hereafter such contests & heats among the States as wd. probably destroy the plan even if it sd. be acceded to by the States without this paragraph. Mr. Dyer was in favor of the paragraph. Mr. Rutledge opposed it as letting in a flood of claims which were founded on extravagant projects of the States. Mr. Higgenson & Mr Ghorum were earnest in favor of it, remarking that the distance of Massachusetts from Congs. had denied a previous sanction to the Militia operations agst. General Burgoyne &c. The Penobscot expedition also had great weight with them. Mr. Williamson was in favor of it. Mr. Wilson said he had always considered this Country with respect to the war, as forming one community; and that the States which by their remoteness from Congs. had been obliged to incur expences for their defence without previous sanction, ought to the placed on the same footing with those which had obtained this security; but he could not agree to put them on a better which wd. be the case if their expences sd. be sanctioned in the lump: he proposed therefore that these expences sd. be limited to such as had been in-  curred in a necessary defence; and of which the object in each case sd. be approved by Congress. Mr. [Madison] agreed that the expressions in the paragh. were very loose, & that it wd. be proper to make them as definite as the case wd. admit; he supposed however that all operations agst. the enemy within the limits assigned to the U. S. might be considered as defensive, & in that view the expedition agst. Penobscot might be so called. He observed that the term necessary left a discretion in the Judge as well as the term reasonable: and that it wd. be best perhaps for Congress to determine & declare that they wd. constitute a tribunal of impartial persons to decide on oath as to the propriety of claims of States not authorized heretofore by Congs. He sd. this wd. be a better security to the States & wd. be more satisfactory than the decisions of Congs., the members of wch. did not act on oath, & brought with them the spirit of advocates for their respective states rather than of impartial judges between them. He moved that the clause with Mr. Wilsons proposition be recommitted; which was agreed to without opposition. (11 & 12 paraghs.) Mr. Bland opposed it: said that the value of land was the best rule, and that at any rate no change sd. be attempted untill its practicability sd. be tried. Mr. [Madison] thought the value of land, could never be justly or satisfactorily obtained; that it wd. ever be a source of contentions among the States; and that as a repetition of the valuation would be in the course of the 25 years, it wd. unless exchanged for a more simple rule mar the whole plan. Mr. Ghorum was in favr. of the paraghs. He represented in strong terms the inequality & clamors produced by valuations of land in the State of Masts., & the probability of the evils being increased among the States themselves which were less tied together & more likely to be jealous of each other. Mr. Williamson was in favr. of paraghs. Mr. Wilson was strenuous in favor of it, sd. he was in Congs. when the article of Confederation directing a value of land was agreed to, that it was the effect of the impossibility of compromising the different ideas of the Eastern & Southern States as to the value of Slaves compared with the Whites. Mr. Clarke was in favor of it. He said that he was also in Congs. at the time this article was decided, that the Southern States wd. have agreed to numbers, in preference to the value of land if 1/2 their slaves only sd. be included; but that the Eastern States would not concur in that proportion.)(5) It was agreed on all sides that instead of fixing the proportion by ages as the report proposed it would be best to fix the proportion in absolute numbers. With this view & that the blank might be filled up--the clause was recommitted.(6) MARCH 27, 1782  ""

  Sir, Philadelphia March 28th. 1783. In my last I had only to inform your Excellency that the preliminary Articles for a peace had been agreed to between the Ministers of the United States and those of his Britannic Majesty; I have now the pleasure presenting my Congratulations upon the Arrival of undoubted intelligence that preliminaries had been agreed to by all the belligerent powers, and that the Definitive Treaty for a general Peace is momently expected. I had just time per the last post to forward two papers, under cover to Governor Bowen(1)containing a summary of the principal Articles, together with the Orders of the Compte de Estaing, for a Cessation of hostilities by sea--one of which I requested him to forward immediately to you. The consequent resolves of Congress will be forwarded, by the Secretary for Foreign affairs. Two days before the Arrival of this intelligence Congress passed a Resolution of which the enclosed is a Copy.(2) The late uneasiness which arose in the Army, upon the return of their Committee from Congress, (artfully excited & as is supposed by some insidious enemy) and which, in its first appearances threatened a general Mutiny--but which by the prudence & wisdom of their illustrious General terminated happily, and much to the honor of the Officers--I have no doubt, tended to precipitate that resolution. Every effort was made to obtain a reference of the Officers to their respective States for compensation; but in vain. Whilst acting against that measure I was happy in possessing sentiments coinciding with the instructions of my Constituents--and to believe those instructions were founded in the most worthy motives--of guarding against the violation of the Constitutions of the states--and the preservation of the Rights & priviledges which those constitutions secured, and which it was feared would be endangered by such an Establishment. The affair of a general impost which has engrossed a great part of the time since the commencement of the present year is yet incomplete. I had flattered myself that the Arrival of intelligence of Peace would put a stop to the proceedings--as thereby, the formidable plea of necessity would be in a measure superseded; And as it could not be doubted but the States when eased of the immediate expences of prosecuting the war--and enjoying unmolested--the advantages to be derived from Agriculture & Commerce, would be able to draw out their resources timely and sufficient, to answer the necessary, and Constitutional requisitions of Congress, for the support of the federal government, and for the satisfaction of the Creditors of the public. But in this I was mistaken. Ideas of the necessity of form- MARCH 28, 1783  ing a general System of Finance--(which will throw a share of the power & strength of Government, now held by the States--into the hands of Congress) seems in the minds of some to prevail over every other Consideration--and it appears that nothing will give satisfaction, but to send out the Imposts differently modified--for another trial, amongst the States. I shall now feel little uneasiness for its fate--from a Confidence that the wisdom of the States is fully apprized, as to its Consequences. No intelligence on which I can rely has been recieved of the doings of the Assembly, at their last session. The Last post, bro't me neither letters--nor Papers. I wish for the earliest information with respect to every matter which may be designed, either for my attention or direction.

On the question, N.H. ay, Mas. divd., R. I. no, Cont. no, N.J. ay, Pa. ay, Maryd. ay, Va. ay, N.C. ay, S.C. ay. For the question on the whole paragraph see the Journal.(2) The arguments used by those who were for rating slaves high were; that the expence of feeding & cloathing them was as far below that incident to freemen, as their industry & ingenuity were below those of freemen: and that the warm climate within wch. the States having slaves lay, compared wth. the rigorous climate & inferior fertility of the others, ought to have great weight in the case & that the exports of the former were greater than of latter. On the other side it was said that Slaves were not put to labour as young as the children of laboring families--that having no interest in their labor they did as little as possible, & omitted every exertion of thought requisite to facilitate & expedite it: that if the exports of the States having slaves exceeded those of the others, their imports were in proportion. Slaves being employed wholly in agriculture, not in manufactures: & that in fact the balance of trade formerly was much more agst. the So. States than the others. On the main question see Journal. ""

  My dear Brother, Philadelphia March 29th 1783 Mr. Remsen will attend the Court with my Extract. The principal Business that will require any great attention, is the execution of a Writ of Inquiry. What can be the design of the putting us to the Trouble of this writ, I know not, as it is on a plain promissory Note of MARCH 29, 1783  Hand. There was a large Acct. between the Parties in Continental money. The Settlement was left to Dr. Elmore who turned the Ballance into Hard money at a large discount, such a one as he thought right, & the Deft. being satisfied with it gave this Note accordingly. I am told he means to controvert the quantum of the discount. This I think he cannot do before the Sheriff, as the Note speaks for itself. I beg you will particularly attend to it on Thursday. I have wrote you a Letter by one John Bodine,(1) which I beg your very particular attention to. Mr. Jasper Smith gave me Notice of Tryal in this Cause, for the Term but not a legal one, as there had been no Proceedings for a Year, it ought to have been a Term Notice which it was not. However he has agreed to leave it to a referrence, which you will compleat, agreeable to the Letter Bodine has, who will call upon you. There is no News since my last, tho' we are in hourly Expectation of an Arrival from Europe. You shall hear it as soon as possible. I wish you to attend to the Note of Hand in the writ of Inquiry above mentioned, to see if it will be necessary to prove the Defts. Hand. I think you can do this by Mr Hunt or somebody in Trenton. Mr Houston his Atty can do it, I am pretty sure. Your Sister is well, but poor Susan has been confined to her Room these 4 days.

  Saturday. March 29. [1783] The objections urged agst. the motion of Mr. Lee on the Journal (1) were that the information demanded from the office of Finance had during a great part of the period been laid before Congress & was then actually on the Table--that the term \""application\"" of money was too indefinite, no two friends of the motion agreeing in the meaning of it, and that if it meant no more than immediate payments under the warrants of the Superintendt to those who were to expend the money, it was unnecessary the Superintendt being already impressed with his duty on that subject; that if it meant the ultimate payment for articles or services for the public, it imposed a task that wd. be impracticable to the Superintdt., and useless to Congress, who could no otherwise examine them than through the department of accounts, & the Committees appd. half yearly for enquiring into the whole proceed MARCH 31, 1783  ings;(2) & that if the motion were free from those objections, it ought to be so varied as to oblige the office of Finance to report the information periodically; since it would otherwise depend on the memory & vigilance of members, and wd. moreover have the aspect of suspicion towards the Officer called upon. N.B. as the motion was made at first, the word \""immediately\"" used; it was changed for the words \""as soon as may be\"" at the instance & Mr. Holten. The object of the motion of Mr. M[adison](3) was to define & comprehend every information practicable & necessary for Congs. to know, & to enable them to judge of the fidelity of their Minister: and to make it a permanent part of his duty to afford it. The clause respecting copies of receipts was found on discussion not to accord with the mode of conducting business & to be too voluminous a task; but the question was taken without a convenient opportunity of correcting it.

  Monday March 31. [1783] A letter was recd. from the Govr, of R. Island with resolutions of the Legislature of that State justifying the conduct of Mr. Howell.(1) On the arrival of the French Cutter with the acct. of the signing of the general preliminaries, it was thought fit by Congress to hasten the effect of them by calling in the American Cruisers.(2) It was also thought by all not amiss to notify simply the Intelligence to the British Commanders at N.Y. In addition to this it was proposed by the Secy. of F. A. and urged by the Delegates of Pa., by Mr. Lee, Mr. Rutlidge & others, that Congress should signify their desire & expectation that hostilities sd. be suspended at sea on the part of the Enemy.(3) The arguments urged were that the effusion of blood might be immediately stopped & the trade of this Country rescued from depredation. It was observed on the other side that such a proposition derogated from the dignity of Congs.; shewed an undue precipitancy; that the intelli- MARCH 31, 1783  gence was not authentic enough to justify the British commanders in complying with such an overture; and therefore that Congs. would be exposed to the mortification of a refusal. The former considerations prevailed & a verbal sanction was given to Mr. Livingston's expressing to the sd. Commanders the expectation of Congs. &c.(4) This day their answers were recd. addressed to Robt. R.

On one side they were unwilling to publish to the world the affront they had recd. especially as no written order had been given for the correspondence and on the other it was necessary that the continuance of hostilities at sea should be made known to American Citizens. Some were in favor of the revocation of hostilities. Others proposed as Col. Bland & Genl. Mifflin, that the Secy. of F. A. should be directed verbally to publish the letters from Carlton & Digby. This was negatived. The superinscription was animadverted upon particularly by Mr. Mercer, who said that the letters ought to have been sent back unopened.

  Tuesday April 1. 1783. Mr. Ghorum called for the order of the day to wit the Report on Revenue &c.(1) and observed as a cogent reason for hastening that business that the Eastern States at the invitation of the Legislature of Massts. were with N.Y. about to form a convention for regulating matters of common concern,(2) & that if any plan sd. be sent out by Congs. during their session, they would probably cooperate with Congs. in giving effect to it. Mr. Mercer expressed great disquietude at this information, considered it as a dangerous precedent, & that it behoved the Gentleman to explain fully the objects of the Convention, as it would be necessary for the S. States to be otherwise very circumspect in agreeing to any plans on a supposition that the general confederacy was to continue. Mr. Osgood said that the sole object was to guard agst. an interference of taxes among States, whose local situation required such precautions: and that if nothing was defi[ni]tively concluded without the previous communication to & sanction of Congs. the confederation could not be said to be in any manner departed from; but that in fact nothing was intended that could be drawn within the purview of the fderal articles. Mr. Bland said he had always considered those Conventions as improper & contravening the spirit of the fderal Governmt.(3) He said they had the appearance of young Congresses. Mr. Ghorum explains as Mr. Osgood. Mr. [Madison] & Mr. Hamilton disapproved of these partial conventions, not as absolute violations of the Confederacy, but as ultimately leading to them & in the mean time exciting pernicious jealousies; the latter observing that he wished instead of them to see a general Convention take place & that he sd. soon in pursuance of instructions  APRIL 1, 1783  from his Constituents, propose to Congs. a plan for that purpose. The object wd. be to strengthen the fderal Constitution. Mr. White informed Congs. that N. Hamshire had declined to accede to the plan of the Convention on foot.(4) Mr. Higginson said that no Gentleman need be alarmed at any rate for it was pretty certain that the Convention would not take place. He wished with Mr. Hamilton to see a General Convention for the purpose of revising and amending the federal Government. These observations having put an end to the subject, Congs. resumed the Report on Revenue &c. Mr. Hamilton who had been absent when the last question was taken for substituting numbers in place of the value of land, moved to reconsider that vote. He was 2ded by Mr. Osgood. See the Journal.(5) Those who voted differently from their former votes were influenced by the conviction of the necessity of the change & despair on both sides of a more favorable rate of the Slaves. The rate of 3/5 was agreed to without opposition. On a preliminary question The apportionmt. of the sum & revision of the same refd. to Grand Come.(6) The Report as to the Resignation of Foreign Ministers was taken up(7) & on the case of Mr. Jefferson.(8) See Journal.

  My dear Friend Philada. April 1. 1783. Your favor of the 22 Ulto. verifies my fears that some disappointment would defeat your plan of going into the Legislature.(1) I regret it the more as every day teaches me more & more the necessity of such measures as I know you would have patronized; and as are are losing ground so fast in the temper of the States as to require every possible support. Unless some speedy & adequate provision be made beyond that of the Confederation, the most dismal alternative stares me in the face. And yesterday's post brought us information that the bill repealing the impost had passed the lower house of Massts. and one of like import had made equal progress in the Legislature of S. Carolina. These defections are alarming, but if a few enlightened & disinterested members would step forward in each Legislature as advocates for the necessary plans, I see with so much force the considerations that might be urged, that my hopes would still prevail. If advantage should be taken of popular prepossessions on one side without such counter-efforts, there is, to be sure, room for nothing but despair. The extract from 's letter recited in yours astonishes me more than it could do you, because I must be more sensible of its contrast to truth.(2) High as my opinion of the object of it was, the judgment, acuteness & patriotism displayed in the last despatches from him,(3) have really enhanced it. So far are they in particular from studiously leaving us in the dark, that some of them are of as late date as any, if not later than those from several & perhaps as voluminous as all the rest put together. The zeal of Congs. to hasten the effect of the general preliminaries, led them (precipitately as I conceive) to authorize the Secy. of F. A. to notify to Sr. G. Carlton & Adml Digby, the intelligence rcd. by the French Cutter on that subject, with their recall of American Cruisers, in order that correspondent measures might be taken at N. Y. The answers from these Commanders were addressed to Robt. R. Livingston Esqr &c &c &c. and imported that they could not suspend hostilities at sea without proper authority from their Sovereign; (4) but as Congress placed full reliance on the authenticity of the intelligence they supposed no objection cd. lie on their part agst. releasing all prisoners &c. A letter from Digby to the French Minister is I am told remarkably surly & indecent even for a British Admiral. We have recd. no official report of the signing of the General Preliminaries, nor any  APRIL 1, 1783  further particulars relative to them. Your surmize as to the dangerous phraseology which may be used in designating our limits, may be realized, if our Ministers are not cautious or sd. yield to improper considerations. But I trust that no such defaults will happen on that side; & that even if they should, the language used by Congress in all their own acts on that head will overpower any arguments that may be drawn from acts of their Ministers. Mrs. Randolph's & your good wishes were recd. by Mrs. House & Mrs Trist with marks of unfiegned affection. The latter will however speak for herself. Docr. Lee sets off to day or tomorrow for Virga. but talks of returning hither before the meeting of the Legislature, which however he means to attend. His immediate object I suppose is to attend the County election.(5) ""

Genll Varnum who appeard here last Novr the time the Cause was Assigned for Trial, when we were dissappointed by the failure of Mr Paca one of the Judges Attending, I then Urged for an Adjournment to be made to sometime, in the Winter or beginning of March by which time I supposed a New Judge would be appointed in the room of Mr Paca who was about to resign, & he might Attend but Genll Varnum who appeard as attorney for Stanton &c opposed it objecting that they could not Travail at that time in the extremity of Winter urging it to be delayd to the beginning of April & finally to Gratefye him & the appellants it was put off to April and it seems they now take the advantage to press on the Execution. But sir I have met with New troubles here. Mr Lowel of Boston who was appointed last APRIL 2, 1783  Novr writes that he cannot attend till some time in May, but then as Mr G Read Another of the Judges who live but about 40 miles from this place appointed att the same time (and I suppose both expect to Recieve their sallary from that time or of their Acceptance) Informes that he has business as a Lawyer before Courts in the State to which he belongs & that he cannot attend at the time Appointed, on which it was moved in Congress & strenuously urged that they would direct the Court to be postponed till some time in May so as to suit the Conveniency of those 2 Judges, which I opposed with all my might insisting that if those Judges would not attend at the time appointed others ought to be put in, in their room. I at length Prevaild so far as to prevent Congress' interfering in the matter. Judge Griffin who has allway been ready to attend & has been so much perplexd with the continued dissappointments from the other Judges & wearied out by delays moved Congress for Liberty to resign his office, here I was again oblidged to Interpose, & by shewing him the ruin which would attend your cause if he resigned I finally persuaded him to Continue with which he Complied and then wrote to Mr Read to Attend at the time as his business & affair in Virginia required him to goe there soon and Mr Read returned him an answer he could not attend in April. Judge Griffin then determined to set out for Virginia as he could be of no service by tarrying if the other Gentn would not attend, but however I have persuaded him to tarry till after the time of the Court, & that I would my self send to Mr Read and let him know fully the State of the Cause the total loss you must sustain in Consequence of his failure. This I have done tho very lately and have not as yet recievd an Answer, my letter was So pressing and that it would take him but a day to come but one to tarry & trye the Cause the 3d he might return back again to his own business, with the circumstances contained in your letter that I am in hopes & have great expectation he will come at the time but if my answer is that he cannot come, as my last resort & which I shall not fail to Attempt will be to indeavor to get a New Judge Appointed Near by who can & will Attend, I can do no more, hope I [can] still succeed, it is nothing but my incessant applic[ation], pushing, that has joind & continued even the pr[esent] prospects.

It will afford me particular pleasure that our correspondence should continue in that channell. You have been punctual hitherto & I have endeavored to follow the good example. I have my fears also about disbanding the army. I wish we were able to pay them. No season would be more favorable for obtaining a loan than the moment of peace. It is whispered among some that the army will not disperse till they are paid or secured of payment. I receive your congratulations on the evacuation of Charlestown with heart felt satisfaction. I am sure they flow from genuine principles of benevolence.

Though no official accounts of this event have yet arrived to Congress yet no person doubts the truth of it here. I shall therefore soon expect to hear that you are in my row. Give me leave to assure you from experience that it is the happiest life.

I believe that you will succeed in Business and am glad that you find no Discouragment on that Account. The Account transmitted from Cadiz by Count de Estaing and the Marquis de La Fyattee Ascertain that a general Peace has taken Place in Europe, and We may dayly expect to receive a formal and Authentic Account of this important Event. Congress have agreed to recommend to the States to Alter the Article of Confederation respecting the precuniary Quota, being Apportioned to the States--so that all free Inhabitants including those bound in Servitude for a limited Period, and three fifths of others APRIL 2, 1783  under different Descriptions Shall serve as a Principle upon which the Assessment shall be made and except Indians nor liable to pay Taxes by Law & Returns to be made triannually.(1) As it will be a Gratification to you to have some Information respecting our National Debt, I will observe (not for Publication)--That our foreign Debt in Case the Applications for the Service of the present year will succed will amount to Dollars 11,925,925 Loan office Debt 11,300,000 Due to the Army from 1st Aug. 1780 to the last of Decr 1782 11,463,802 Liquidated Debt 638,042 Dollars 35,327,769 But as the pay of the Army is computed upon a supposition that the Regiments were full a Very considerable Deduction is to be made on that Account. The Amount of the Unliquidated Debt is Very Uncertain. But if Peace Shall be established this Spring, I think it probable that the Debt exclusive of the Commutation of half Pay to the Army will not exceed forty Millions of Dollars. By Letters from my Family I am urgently called upon to Return to take Care of my domestic Affairs. As I expected to Return in the spring I shall leave Congress in the Course of this month. I hope that I shall be able to get some Money of the Treasurer, I have given too much of my Time to the Publick without Pay. The last year I tarried here till I was oblidged to borrow Money to Return--I will not do it again. My Compliments, to my Friends, yours affectionately, Oliver Wolcott [P.S.] Mr Ellsworth returned here the day before yesterday.(2) Loaned in the office of Connecticut reduced to Specie Dollars 1,269,677.

  Sir Philadelphia April 3d 1783 All the Accounts we as yet recievd from Europe with respect to the Peace Establishment have been Transmitted to your Excellcy to which  APRIL 3,1783  I cannot add. Our Minister of Foreign Affairs transmitted the Account we receivd from Count de Estange of a General Peace being Established to Genll Carlton & Admiral Digby but tho they gave full Credit to it yet having recieved no official Accounts from the Court of G Britain they could not call in the Commissions of their Privateers or restrain their ships of War so that the French Ships on this Coast are prohibited Acting offensively & cannot even protect our Merchant- Men from their Attacks. We think it Strange that no accounts are yet recievd in New York, as five Ships were dispatched from Count Estanges Fleet to every point of Compass to give Notice of a Peace when that was sent off to America which brot us the Intelligence, And further that no proper official Accounts from our Commissioners have not as yet come to hand, we expect them every hour. We suspect if any thing has delay'd the final Closure of the affair it lies between Spain & the American States, as Spain appears to be very fond if possible to Crowd us off from the Missisippi but we have full Confidence in our Commissioners that they will not yield our Claim to that river to any Power whatever. I am preparing to write you more at large on the present Situation of our affairs in a few days,(1) at present I have sent you the Freemens Journal which will give you a Specimen of the Temper disposition & demands of the officers of our Army,(2) and Notwithstanding the Generalls prudent and discreet address, Still the Tone they hold out is of not disbanding till their full expectations are answered. I shall not at present make any Comments upon it as it is open to every ones Inspection and Observation. Congress have at length agreed to a Commutation of 5 Years whole pay to officers of our Army in Lieu of the half pay for life, which they (however unguarded) had long agoe promised them, & upon the whole as they were 8 states out of 12 present agreeing in the proposed Commutation, and Massachusetts one of the principall New England States going over on that side, Connecticut for reasons which we shall soon explain & hoping in the whole it would not be so disagreeable as the life establishment Consented to it, upon the 5 years to the deranged officers commencing at the time of their derangement. How it will be recieved I know not, but hope for the best. Congress are still persuing some mode of securing our Debts & of recommending some adequate fund for a limited time at least for the payment of Interest to the several States. Drye, forced & direct taxes for monies on the body of the people we fear will not answer, if by Dutys & Impost on Trade, it must be paid in the first Instance by those through whose hands our moneys most frequently Circulate Viz the Merchants, and afterword by those only who Choose it, & without the disagreeable force of a Collector. I am thankfull for the money recievd by Brown, I was in now hopes (3) of soon returning to my Native Country, Mr. Elsworth is just arrived but Genll Wolcott says he must in a few days set off for home,  APRIL 3, 1783  & percieve I am again to be left in the Lurch or leave the State unrepresented. Am sure this is not the time for it, I did not propose to set off till the beginning of May but if no Gentn comes to supply my place then whatt shall I do, to tarry longer will be with reluctance, but to goe off & leave the State unrepresented I shall fear, hope some Gentn in the Delegation will soon come forward to relieve me & who can do them more service in this Critical Important Season.

  Dear Sir:(1) Philadelphia, April [7-10], 1783.(2) I have given, in some of my letters to Lowell and Jackson, (3) a partial view of the state of politics; those letters I suppose you have seen, as I desired them to be communicated to you and a few others. They will show you how far the opinions of our politicians in Massachusetts have been right, as to the views and conduct of the powers in alliance with us. There has been for a long time a party in Congress so thoroughly in the interest of France as to have preferred her interest to ours, whenever they came into competition. They carried through the memorable instructions to our ministers, which threw them entirely into the hands of Mons. Vergennes. Their views, however, by the inadvertence of Vergennes and the firmness of Jay and Adams, have been completely defeated. Their surprise and chagrin when the despatches were read, they could not conceal; and, finding that these instructions would no longer bind those ministers, and that if they remained in Europe commercial negotiations would next engage their attention, though not sufficiently commissioned to complete them, they have endeavored to remove such dangerous persons, by passing an unjust censure on their conduct during the negotiations for peace;--but in this also have they failed. I expect, when the definitive treaty arrives, and we have a full view of the whole negotiations, that Congress will, in the strongest terms, approve of their conduct, though I am sure every possible means will be used to prevent it. Should this happen, their chagrin will be complete I think, for it will necessarily open the way for a commission to negotiate a commercial treaty with Britain. France has been, and still  APRIL 7, 1783  is, exceedingly afraid of such a connection. She wishes, if possible, to prevent it, especially since she finds that Britain has wisely determined to give us every advantage in trade. (4) But shall we neglect to avail ourselves of such an opening? It is our business to cultivate a friendly intercourse with every trading nation, and to secure to ourselves as great and extensive advantages, in the way of commerce, as possible. The extravagant ideas which Europeans have formed of the advantages that they will derive from a trade with us, we certainly ought by no means to root out, but rather to make the most we can of them all. To lose so lucky a moment, and to neglect the improving such impressions to our own benefit, would surely argue a great want of discernment, and show a great deficiency in our political character. The advices from Mr. Dana discover a knowledge of mankind and the interests of the powers in Europe, which does him honor; but the same leaven has leavened the whole lump. He is so restrained by the French Minister at Petersburg, that I am afraid he will derive no advantage to us from his mission. Being bound to consult him, he dares not make any direct and explicit overtures, though persuaded that everything in that court was ripe for negotiation. I wish he may follow the example of Jay and Adams, and show the world that no dishonorable bands can fetter Americans. We are still hammering on a strange, though artful, plan of finance,(5) in which are combined a heterogeneous mixture of imperceptible and visible, constitutional and unconstitutional taxes. It contains the impost, quotas, and cessions of Western lands, and no part of it is to be binding unless the whole is adopted by all the States. This connection and dependence of one part on another is designed to produce the adoption of the whole. The cessions are to serve as sweeteners to those who oppose the impost; the impost is intended to make the quotas more palatable to some States; and the receiving it in whole is made necessary to secure the adoption of the whole, by working on the fears of those States who wish to reject a part of it only. It may happen that a State, strongly impressed with the necessity of public taxes, may be thereby induced to receive it in whole, though opposed to some part of it, lest, through the failure of public funds, great evils may result; but I cannot imagine that such a plan will succeed--the artifice is not complete. The States will see, I trust, that Virginia and New York mean only to give them what is of no value, and not their property to dispose of, in order to secure to themselves a valuable territory which they now have no good claim to, and oblige the continent hereafter to guarantee and defend it for them. Madison has clearly, I think, shown that such is their intention in this scheme; this he did in an unguarded moment. Rhode Island has approved in the fullest and strongest terms of Mr. Howell's conduct. South Carolina and Massachusetts have repealed   their impost acts, and yet these people will not only insist upon another trial, but make all provisions for supplies depend on the success of the impost. Is not this hazarding the public peace and safety, and urging a measure against all hope of success? If the public creditors see no provision made to secure their debts, and not even a prospect of receiving the interest, they will grow very uneasy and clamorous. What then will they think of the present scheme, which will most certainly fail of success, and occasion the loss of two years' time in making the attempt? The truth is, they are so very desirous of carrying the impost, that they are willing to hazard much rather than give over the pursuit. Connecticut, New Hampshire, New Jersey, expect great relief from it, and will swallow it at all hazards. North Carolina and Virginia hope that it will be duly collected, if adopted, in many of the States, but have not the most distant expectation or intention of collecting it themselves. New York and Pennsylvania have other views in pushing for it. Pennsylvania has passed an act for paying the interest to their own subjects on Continental certificates, and to charge it to the requisition for the year.(6) Massachusetts has the same right to take care of her subjects, and they will expect it; but will not this encourage the delinquents to make no proper provision for that part of the public debt, and has it not a direct tendency, if the principle be extended, to produce confusion and dissension? We may as well apply the whole, as a part, of the requisition; we may redeem the old money which our subjects have by them upon the same principle, but how then is the public treasury to be supplied? It may, perhaps, result in each State's sitting down with its present respective burden, and be an additional bar against a general settlement. Congress have not yet tried the strength of the Confederation, nor have they had a good opportunity to do it. If quotas are assigned to the several States, equal to the interest of the public debt and the current expenses, and a majority of the States should make provision competent to the discharge of their quotas, will they not find means to coerce those that are delinquent? Will not two or three frigates in time of peace be sufficient for that purpose? Every State except Jersey depends much on its trade, and could not long bear the suppression of it; but should a majority of these prove delinquent, a vote for coercion could not obtain, though Congress were possessed of the means. There must be a thorough disposition in the States, or a large majority of them, to act honestly, to take their respective shares of the common burden, and to adhere strictly to the principles of the Confederation, or the Union will necessarily be dissolved. I am sorry that Massachusetts has proposed a general impost through New England;(7) it cannot succeed, and may excite jealousies. New Hampshire and Connecticut will imagine it to be against their interest. The same reasons that induce them to push for a general one,   will lead them to reject your proposition. Let each State take its own course, and impose those duties at its own time and in its own way. Their necessities will oblige them to make use of such means, sooner or later; and when they have once adopted such taxes, and find all prospect of a general impost has vanished, then you may make such a proposition with advantage. In the mean time care must be taken that your own impost shall operate only on your consumption, to prevent your trade from being transferred to the other States.  I saw a letter from Mr. Dalton to Mr. Gorham that diverted me; he writes that our late impost operates very kindly--that those evils which he apprehended do not result from it, and that our people have become so fond of that mode of taxing, and are so very desirous of extending it, as to be prepared for a general impost through the Continent. This was written at or about the time of their repealing their late law, and appeared to me extraordinary. But when I considered the person writing, and him to whom it was written, my surprise ceased. It must, I think, be a mistake. How agreeable it is to see a man open to conviction! I shall send you by Mr. Osgood, in three weeks, your dividend of the bank interest. The power will not answer the purpose of letting me into the management of the bank stock. My respects to all friends in Newbury, &c. I am, with due esteem, your most humble servant, S. Higginson. P.S. I can't spend time to copy--you must read as well as you can. Pray let me have a long letter, showing the state of politics with you. MS not found; reprinted from Theophilus Parsons, Memoir of Theophilus Parsons, Chief Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts (Boston: Tichnor and Fields, 1859), pp. 456-60. 1 Theophilus Parsons (1750-1813), a Newburyport, Mass. lawyer, had played a prominent role in framing the Massachusetts constitution of 1780. DAB. 2 Higginson obviously wrote this letter before April 18 when Congress adopted the general plan of finance that is a principal subject of it, and probably before news arrived in Philadelphia of the signing of the general peace treaty between France and Britain, which was disseminated April 9-10. His references at the conclusion of the letter to the payment of a bank dividend and to Samuel Osgood's planned departure from Philadelphia \""in three weeks\"" are to events that would occur at the end of April. 3 Higginson's letters to his nephew John Lowell and his business partner Jonathan Jackson have not been found. 4 The delegates continued to be deluded on this point for several months, for not until mid-August did intelligence begin to arrive with a more realistic appraisal of the restrictive trade policy Britain intended to pursue with her former colonies. See, for example, Benjamin Hawkins to Alexander Martin, August 16, 1783. 5 This \""artful\"" plan was adopted April 18. The quotas to be assigned the states under this plan, based on a system of \""numbers and proportions\"" reported by a committee appointed April 1, were adopted on April 7. See JCC, 24:230-31; and James Madison's Notes of Debates, April 2-5, 1783. 6 For a discussion of Pennsylvania's threat to Continental management of the public debt, and the move towards \""state-oriented public finance\"" as New Hampshire and New  Jersey subsequently joined Pennsylvania in its determination to service the Continental loan office certificate interest payments due its own citizens, see E.

  Monday April 7. [1783] The sense of Congs. having been taken on the truth of the numbers reported by the Grand Committee, the no. allotted to S.C. was reduced to 150,000 on the representation of the Delegates of that State.(1) The delegates of N.J. contended also for a reduction, but were unsuccessful. Those of Virga also, on the principle that Congs. ought not to depart from the relative numbers given in 1775, (2) without being required by actual returns which had not been obtained either from that State, or others whose relation wd. be varied. To this reasoning were opposed the verbal & credible information recd. from different persons & particularly Mr. Mercer, which made the no. of Inhabitants in Va. after deducting 2/5 of the Slaves, exceed the number allotted to that State. Congs. were almost unanimous agst. the reduction. A motion was made by Mr. Gervais 2d by Mr. Madison to reduce the no. of Georgia to 15,000 on the probability that their real no. did not exceed it, & the cruelty of overloading a State which had been so much torn & exhausted by the war. The motion met with little support & was almost unanimously negatived.  A letter was recd. from Genl. Washington expressing the joy of the army at the signing of the general preliminaries notified to him & their satisfaction at the commutation of half pay agreed to by Congs.(2) ""

  Sir, Philadelphia, 8th April 1783. In obedience to the commands of Congress I have the honor to enclose to your Excellency copies of sundry letters relative to the very  APRIL 8, 1783  extraordinary conduct of a Capt. Hayden and Mr. Church, in capturing the vessel San Antonio, belonging to a Mr. Argote, within the Spanish Dominions on the Mississipi. This unprovoked violation of the Laws of Nations, if clearly proved, calls loudly for the interference of Government, and is therefore submitted to the consideration of a Committee of Congress, as far as respects the injury done to the Flag of His Most Catholic Majesty. As to the private redress demanded by Mr. Argote, a Subject of the Crown of Spain, Congress have thought proper to refer him to the justice of your State, where he will undoubtedly obtain ample compensation for every injury he has sustained contrary to the principles of good faith and the laws of Nations.(1) Congress wish to recommend Mr. Argote to your countenance, protection and assistance, so far as to put him in a way of accomplishing this end, in the most legal and expeditious manner possible, as his Journey from New-Orleans is altogether on this business. From the knowlege I have of your Excellency's disposition to aid and assist the injured and the Stranger, as well as from your known attachment to the honor and dignity of your Country, I am perfectly satisfied that all arguments to urge your attention to this Gentleman's particular case will be needless.  Mr. Argote informs me that he carries with him authentic documents to support the facts referred to in the several letters inclosed.  We are in the most anxious expectation of receiving the official advices of the definitive Treaty of peace being concluded and ratified. An arrival at New-York from Lisbon confirms the News received by the Triumph, but not officially.  I have the honor to be &c. E.B. P.S. Since writing the above I have received advices from New-York, that the Ship Vigilant has arrived there from Lisbon with a confirmation of peace. The Packet went up also on Saturday evening last, which it is said has brought the official accounts. The Preliminary Treaty was ratified and exchanged in Paris on the 3d of February, so that all hostilities between France & Spain & England ceased on the 3d instant. Permit me to congratulate your Excellency, with the most sensible pleasure, on this glorious event. E.B. ""

  Sir, [April 8, 1783](1) I have received your Excellency's letters of the 31st of March & 4th of April, the last to day.(2) The one to Col Bland as member of the Committee has been read in Committee confidentially and gave great satisfaction.(3) The idea of not attempting to separate the army before the settlement of accounts corresponds with my proposition. That of endeavouring to let them have some pay had also appeared to me indispensable. The expectations of the army as represented by Your Excellency are moderation itself. To morrow we confer with the Superintendant of Finance on the subject of money. There will be difficulty, but not we hope insurmountable.(4)  I thank your Excellency for the hints you are so obliging as to give me in your private letter.(5) I do not wonder at the suspicions that have been infused, nor should I be surprised to hear that I have been pointed out as one of the persons concerned in playing the game described. But facts must speak for themselves. The Gentlemen who were here from the army; General McDougall who is still here will be able to give a true account of those who have supported the just claims of the army, and of those who have endeavoured to elude them. There are two classes of men Sir in Congress of very Different views--one attached to state, the other to Continental politics. The last have been strenuous advocates for funding the public debt upon solid securities; the former have given every opposition in their power <<to the measure> and have only been dragged into the measures which are now near being adopted by the clamours of the army and other public creditors. The advocates for Continental funds have blended the interests of the army with other Creditors from a conviction, that no funds for partial purposes will go through those states to whose citizens the United States are largely indebted--or if they should he carried through from impressions of the moment would have the necessary stability; for the influence of those unprovided for would always militate against a provision for others, in exclusion of them. It is in vain to tell men who have parted with a large part of their property on the public faith that the services of the army are intitled to a preference. They would reason from their interest and their feelings. These would tell them that they had as great a title as any other class of the community to public justice, and that while this was denied to them, it would be unreasonable to make them bear their part of a burthen for the benefit of others. This is the way they would reason & as their influence in some of the states was considerable they would have been able to prevent any partial provision. APRIL 8, 1783  But the question was not merely how to do justice to the <<army> creditors, but how to restore public credit. Taxation in this Country, it was found, could not supply a sixth part of the public necessities. The loans in Europe were far short of the ballance, and the prospect every day diminishing. The Court of France telling us in plain terms she could not even do as much as she had done. Individuals in Holland & every where else refusing to part with their money on the precarious tenure of the mere faith of this country, without any pledge for the payment either of principal or interest.  In this situation what was to be done? It was essential to our cause that vigorous efforts should be made to restore public credit--it was necessary to combine all the motives to this end, that could operate upon different descriptions of persons in the different states. The necessity and discontents of the army presented themselves as a powerful engine.  But Sir these Gentlemen would be puzzled to support their insininuations by a single fact. It was indeed proposed to appropriate the intended impost on trade to the army debt and what was extraordinary by Gentlemen who had expressed their dislike to the principle of the fund. I acknowlege I was one that opposed this; for the reasons already assigned & for these additional ones. That was the fund on which we most counted--to obtain further loans in Europe--it was necessary we should have a fund sufficient to pay the interest of what had been borrowed & what was to be borrowed. The truth was these people in this instance wanted to play off the army against the funding system.  As to Mr. Morris, I will give Your Excellency a true explanation of his conduct. He had been for some time pressing Congress to endeavour to obtain funds, and had found a great backwardness in the business. He found the taxes unproductive in the different states--he found the loans in Europe making a very slow progress--he found himself pressed on all hands for supplies; he found himself in short reduced to this alternative either of making engagements which he could not fulfill or declaring his resignation in case funds were not established by a given time. Had he followed the first course the bubble must soon have burst--he must have sacrificed his credit & his character, and public credit already in a ruinous condition would have lost its last support. He wisely judged it better to resign; this might increase the embarrassments of the moment, but the necessity of the case it was to be hoped would produce the proper measures; and he might then resume the direction of the machine with advantage and success. He also had some hope that his resignation would prove a stimulus to Congress.  He was however ill-advised in the publication of his letters of resignation. This was an imprudent step and has given a handle to his per-  sonal enemies, who by playing upon the passions of others have drawn some well meaning men into the cry against him. But Mr. Morris certainly deserves a great deal from his country. I believe no man in this country but himself could have kept the money-machine a going during the period he has been in office. From every thing that appears his administration has been upright as well as able.  The truth is the old leaven of Deane & Lee is at this day working against Mr. Morris. He happened in that dispute to have been on the side of Deane & certain men can never forgive him. A man whom I once esteemed,(6) and whom I will rather suppose duped than wicked is the second actor in this business.  The matter with respect to the army which has occasioned most altercation in Congress and most dissatisfaction in the army has been the half pay. The opinions on this head have been two--one party was for referring the several lines to their states to make such commutation as they should think proper--the other for making the commutation by Congress and funding it on Continental security. I was of this last opinion and so were all those who will be represented as having made use of the army as puppets. Our principal reasons were 1st by referring the lines to their respective states, those which were opposed to the half pay would have taken advantage of the officers necessities, to make the commutation far short of an equivalent. 2dly. The inequality which would have arisen in the different states when the officers came to compare (as has happened in other cases) would have been a new source of discontent. 3dly. such a reference was a continuance of the old wretched state system, by which the ties between Congress and the army have been nearly dissolved--by which the resources of the states have been diverted from the common treasury & wasted; a system which Your Excellency has often justly reprobated.  I have gone into these details to give You a just idea of the parties in Congress. I assure you upon my honor Sir I have given you a candid state of facts to the best of my judgment. The men against whom the suspicions you mention must be directed are in general the most sensible the most liberal, the most independent and the most respectable characters in our body as well as the most unequivocal friends to the army. In a word they are the men who think continentally.  I have the honor to be, With sincere respect & esteem, Yr. Excellcys Most Obed servt. A Hamilton  [P.S.] I am Chairman of a Committee for peace arrangements.(7) We shall ask Your Excellency's opinion at large on a proper military peace establishment. I will just hint to Yr. Excellency that our prejudices will make us wish to keep up as few troops as possible.  We this moment learn an officer is arrived from Sir Guy Car[l]eton with disptaches, probably official accounts of peace.(8)  ""

  My dear Sir Philada. Apl. 8. 1783. Your favor of the 29th ult. was duly recd. yesterday.(1) Your apprehensions from the article in favor of British Creditors, correspond with those entertained by all whose remarks I have heard upon it. My hope is that in the definitive treaty the danger may be removed by a suspension of their demands for a reasonable term after peace. The publication of Mr. M's letters was neither previously assented to nor known by Congress. Whether it was the act of Mr. M. himself is even unknown to them. After the injunction of secresy was taken off, the curiosity of any individual, or the interest of the printer might obtain copies for the press.(2)  The imperfect information brought by the French Cutter is all that we have yet recd. relative to peace. It is reported from N. York that similar intelligence has been brought thither by a vessel from Lisbon. Hostilities however continue to devour our commerce.  The report on revenue of which I gave you the outlines (3) is still in an unfinished State; but in a way I flatter myself of being ultimately & substantially adopted. The admission into the common mass, of all expences of the war not authorized by Congress is the remaining article of difficulty.(4) Even this however under some qualifications is so respectably patronized & so intimately linked with the art[i]cle concerning the back lands that I do not despair altogether of seeing that also finally comprehended. A change of the valuation of Lands for the number of Inhabitants deducting 2/5 of the Slaves, has recd. a tacit sanction & unless hereafter expunged will go forth in the general recommendation, as material to future harmony & justice among the members of the Confederacy. The <<proportion> deduction of 2/5 was a APRIL 8, 1783  compromize between the wide opinions & demands of the Southern & other States.  A letter was recd. yesterday from Genl Washington in answer to a notification from the Presidt. of the signing the Genl. preliminaries on the 20th Jany. expressing the joy of the army at the glorious event, and the satisfaction they have recd. from the act of Congs. commuting the half pay &c.(5)  The Mission of Mr. Jefferson has been entirely superceded by the last advices. He will set out in a few days for Virga. and means to pass through Richmond.6 To his information I refer for details which my late correspondence may have omitted. As his services are not required, at least for the present, in Europe, it is to be most devoutly wished that they could be engaged at the present crisis at home.  ""

  Wednesday April 9. [1783] A memorial was recd. from Genl. Hazen in behalf of the Canadians who had engaged in the cause of the U.S. praying that a tract of vacant land on L. Erie might be allotted to them.(1) Mr. Wilson thereupon moved that a Come. be appointed to consider and report to Congress the measures proper to be taken with respect to the Western Country. In support of his motion he observed on the importance of that Country, the danger from immediate emigrations of its being lost to the public; & the necessity on the part of Congress of taking care of the fderal interests in the formation of New States, which could not take place by the authority of any particular States. Mr. [Madison] observed that the appointment of such a Come. could not be necessary at this juncture & might be injurious, that Congs. were about to take in the report on Revenue &c. the only step that could now be properly taken, viz to call again on the States claiming the W. Territory to cede the same; that until the result sd. be known every thing wd. be premature & wd. excite in the States irritations & jealousies that might frustrate the Cessions; that it was indispensable to obtain these cessions in order to compromize the disputes, & to derive advantage from the territory to the U. S.; that if the motion meant merely to prevent irregular settlements, a recommendation to that effect ought to be made to the States--that if ascertaining & disposing of the garrisons proper to be kept up in that Country was the object it was already in the hands of the Come. on peace arrangements; but might be referred to them. Mr. Mercer supported the same ideas. Mr. Clarke considered the motion as no wise connected with peace arrangements; his object was to define the western limits of the States which Congs. alone cd. do, and which it was necessary they sd. do in order to know what territory properly belonged to the U. S. and what steps ought to be taken relative to it. He disapproved of repeatedly courting the States to make cessions wch. Congs. stood in no need of. Mr. Wilson seemed to consider as the property of the U. S. all terri- tory over which particular States had not exercised jurisdiction particularly N. W. of Ohio, & said that within the Country confirmed to the U. S. by the Provisional articles, there must be a large Country over which no particular claims extended. He was answered that the exercise of jurisdiction was not the criterion of the territorial rights of the States; that Pa. had maintained always a contrary doctrine; that if it were a criterion Va. had exercised jurisdiction over the Illinois & other places conquered N. W. of the Ohio; that it was uncertain whether limits of the U. S. as fixed by the APRIL 9, 1783  Provl. Arts. did comprehend any territory out of the claims of the individual States; that sd. it be the case a dicision or examination of the point had best be put off till it sd. be seen whether Cessions of the States wd. not render it unnecessary; that it cd. not be immediately necessary for the purpose of preventing settlemts. on such extra lands, since they must lie too remote to be in danger of it. Congress refused to refer the motion to the Come. on peace arrangements, and by a large majority referred it to a special Come. viz. Messrs. Osgood, Wilson, Madison, Carrol & Williamson; to whom was also referred the Meml. of Genl. Hazen.(2) On the preceding question Cont.(3) was strenuous in favr. of Mr. Wilsons motion. A motion was made by Mr. Dyer to strike out the drawback on salt fish &c.(4) Mr. Ghorum protested in the most solemn manner that Massts. wd. never accede to the plan without the drawback. The motion was very little supported. ""

  Hon. Sir Philadelphia April 9 1783 I wish you Joy on the Confirmation of the news of peace, which it is likely you may have before this reaches you. I can give no other account thereof than what is contained in the Inclosed prints. I wrote last week by Mr Gilman,(1) who doubtless will be at home before you receive this. Congress have been for some time past trying to agree on a plan to lay an Impost in order to pay the Interest of the public Debts. It is not yet ready to send to the states for their approbation. By calculation it is thought that the Impost propos'd will fall short of the amount of the Interest of said Debts--about one million five Hundred thousand dollars, it is therefore proper to call on the states to make up said deficiency at present propo[r]tioned as followeth(2) Dollars Dols. viz New Hampshire 52,708 Maryland 141,517 Massachusetts 224,427 Virginia 256,487 Rhode Isleland 32,318 North Cara. 109,006 Connecticutt 132,191 South Cara. 96,183 New York 128,243 Georgia 16,030 N.

This subject is started in the House of Lords, by Lord Loughboro',(1) but the ministry obtained on a vote an approbation of the peace. In consequence, the address is presented, and in answer, his majesty thanks very particularly the House of Lords. He concludes with expressing his warmest approbation of the spirit of Parliament towards the Loyalists, and makes no doubt, that the power which has stipulated in their favor, will carry to the utmost latitude a fulfilment of their engagements.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia April 12th. 1783.  The establishment of the Independence of the United States--and an Amicable settlement between the belligerent Powers--by which the blessings of Peace are once more restored to this Country--must give a new turn to every species of Business. My unacquaintance even with that in which I am essentially interested renders me very unfit to advise--respecting measures necessary to be pursued in order to render it Advantageous--for this I shall rely on your extensive experience--and only take the Liberty to propose a few queries for Consideration. Will it not be best to make the necessary preparation for another & a long blast of the Furnace as soon as possible?1 The rapid progress which will be made in new settlements--above you--opens a door for a Market--on one hand--And the very destitute Circumstances of the Inhabitants of the Western States will afford a large vent--on the other hand (and by the bye--would not a circuitous Voyage by the West Indies from those States with produce which might be had for ware--be a matter worthy Attention?)  APRIL 12, 1783  If any thing of this kind should prove eligible I have it in my power to establish Correspondents in those States of Virginia, No. & So. Carolina (& Georgia, if necessary) which might prove advantageous.  Will it be proper to engage for Goods to supply a Store in Company? The stability of Prices--& value of Money--by which business may be now done & contracts entered into without risque leads to this Quere--an early start (in business as in travelling) is the distance half gained. If the Circuitous trade hinted at above was eligible engagements--might be accordingly made--and various turns made to render business more easy.  AWill it not be proper to set on foot the making of Pot & pearl Ash--immediately, or as soon as possible--to prevent its being diverted to other hands? This we may do with as much ease & perhaps advantage as any Persons--having the most expensive Apparatus in our own Power. I expect, Sir, before you give an Answer a most important Quere will present itself--Vizt. How is the Expences to be supplied?--this will puzzle me more than an hundred such as the preceeding would you. Nevertheless--I should not despair of its being done--some money, some goods or, which is the same in substance--some Credit might with a proper attention & Application effect it. I should be very happy to be present with you--to consult on every necessary point but that is impossible at present. I can therefore only assure you of my earnest wish to do every thing to promote our Mutual interest--and will endeavor to supply--what shall be incumbent on me whether in Money, or Credit for the purpose, assuring you that I shall place the utmost confidence in every Arrangement You shall be disposed to make--and circumstances will admit. Does the C____n continue in the same disagreable ______? Will he quit on reasonable terms? Will it not be best, to accept such terms?  Are you likely to effect a Division? Answer as soon as possible-- Under Cover to Dr. Randall. This is Confidential--from, Dear Sir, Your very hume Servt. J Arnold  P.S. As I have some hope to see you before I shall have opportunity to write again--after recieving your Answer--I shall defer some things--to a personal interview.  ""

  My dear Marquiss. Phil. Aprill 12th. 1783.  The many Obligations this Country has been laid under by your repeated kindnesses, have been not only revived, but greatly increased  APRIL 12, 1783  by your prudent & Zealous attention to afford her the earliest Information of the glad Tidings of an Event the most glorious to her Fame as well as essential to her Interests.(1) Capt. Duquesne, whose conduct & despatch does him great honor, anounced to us in the first Instance the happy Issue of our negotiations. The Joy afforded to America on this Occasion was too great for utterance and you had the universal Thanks of the Friends of this Country. The early Intelligence saved our Mercantile Interest greatly, as the long cessation of News from our Ministers had shaken the Faith of many as to the Issue. The glorious struggle, blessed be God, is now over, and I am happy that you have so great a Share in her Laurels. Our worthy General is not the least sharer in the general Joy. We have now leisure I hope to turn our attention to consolidating the general Union & perfecting our Government.  Congress are perfectly satisfied with your remaining in Europe, and I have the honor & Satisfaction of enclosing you a Copy of their Vote on this Occasion.(2)  Congress are very sensible of the very obliging Conduct of his Excellency the Compte de Estaing in so readily & generously devoting the Triumph to the benevolent Purpose of being the bearer of the important Intelligence.  As soon as Capt DuQuesne arrived, certified Copies of the Intelligence was transmitted to Genl Carleton & admiral Digby--the last of whom most ungenerously affected to consider it as a design in Compt de Estaing to mislead him, while he was accomplishing some stroke in the west Indies. However he was in a few days convinced of his Error by the arrival of an English Packett.  We are anticipating the Pleasure of your Arrival here with Anxiety.  I take the liberty of inclosing copies of the Vote of Congress in Favour of Compte De' Rochambeau, & of my Letter addressed to him on that occasion. My reason for this is, to beg the Favour of your endeavouring to know the reason for the Compte's leaving America without taking the least Notice of it, or even answering my Letter. I do this merely in my private Character, for altho' it has been noticed by the Members of Congress, yet Congress has made no Observations on it, and I mentioned it to you as a private Friend, who I know will be prudent on the Occasion, at the same time will satisfy my individual Curiosity. I add to the enclosed for your satisfaction some proceedings in the Army, occasioned by the last Efforts of the Enemies of this Country, to raise a Commotion. Their resolutions as well as the Generals Address, gave a finishing Stroke to the Character of our officers. They do them the utmost honor, and the General appears like himself.  The Terms of Peace give universal Satisfaction except that no Time is mentioned for the american Merchts. paying their English Debts. Having the greatest part of their Estates in the public Funds, and having suffered greatly by the depreciation of the money, inevitable ruin must be their Portion if they have not three or four Years to accom-  plish the Business. This is a Matter of very considerable Consequences to which I hope our Ministers will pay attention in the definitive Treaty. This should also be an Object with France, as if not remedied, will throw our Merchts too absolutely into the Hands of the English Creditor.  Shall I ask your Attention to this Subject if not too late as it will be adding greatly to the obligations, already laid on the Citizens of these States. I have the honor to be with every Sentimt of respect & Esteem, My d[ear] Marquiss &c  ""

  Sir Philadelphia April the 12th 1783  I most sincerely Congratulate your Excellcy and the State--On the Great & Important Event of Peace now fully Confirmed and Proclaimed. God Almighty in His Unmerrited goodness by His Great power and outstretched Arm has wrought Salvation and Deliverance for this his oppressed People Erected and Established a new and extended Empire in this Western World. Through Eight Years severe Conflict, And many Dark & gloomy seasons, His Wise And Unerring Providence has manifestly pointed out the Means, the Times, And Seasons, for those Various Exertions, Efforts, and operations which were Necessary in the doubtfull Contest, And with that Vicissitude of adverse dissapointments, and prosperous Success, as might Guard us against Vain Presumsion on the one hand, and secure us against hopeless despair and dispondency on the Other, till at length, When the burthen of our Expences seemed almost too heavy any longer to be borne, our Loads of Debt Accumulating, our publick Credit failing, The People Complaining, God has graciously Calmed the Storm, inclined and Composed the Contending Nations to Peace, Disposed Great Britain (after long & Vain attempts) to Relinquish Her Unjust Claims, Submit to the Manifestations of Divine Providence, And to acknowledge the 13 United States of America Free, Sovereign And Independent. I heartily rejoice Sir that in the Laborious part you have taken in your advanced Years, in The Important Station in which Providence has assigned you, that through Unremitted Diligence & fidelity in which with Unwearied application you have exerted your Utmost Abilities, with Patience, hope and Perseverance in the Cause & Service of your Country, and in the greatest Trials & darkest hours of our Conflict with a firm & Unshaken reliance on Divine Providence, That God has Supported and continued your Valuable life at length to see the Joyfull day of her Deliverance. Rewards you will not too much expect here except in conscious rectitude, but wait with Patience for those Superior with which God will abundantly remunerate his faithfull Servants: I know your Country owe you their Esteem, their respect, and their Gratitude--whether they make you that Remittance, or forbear the just Tribute which is your due. I now expect by the leave of Providence soon to return to my family. My Utmost & faithfull Indeavors to serve the State, and my Country have not been Wanting, I have only to Lament they have been of no more effect, and so little productive of real benefit. Ever since I have been here, the pressing demands of our Army and loud Complaints of our other Numerous Creditors, have continually attended us, without payment, without Stable funds for Principle or  APRIL 12, 1783  Interest, for want of which the Value of their securities were daily lessening, our financies Nearly exhausted, our publick Credit sinking, the People discouraged by heavy taxation and Complaining, But God who as in times past in some of the darkest hours has afforded us unexpected relief; so now when our ways were hedged up on every side, and the Darkness seemed Impenatrable and our prospects of further prosecution of the War daily diminishing God has dispersed the Dark Clouds, he has Commanded the Nations into Peace, And The devouring Sword to be sheathed. The Increasing Expence of Millions in a year is now at an End, and the Remaining Debt tho great & heavy, is far below the purchase & much Short of that of our enemies, who have entirely failed of their Attempts to Enslave us, or even of our Allies whom Providence has raised up to Assist us. No doubt Considerable of our own has arisen by profusion, by mismanagement, by Waste, & by Numerous harpies preying upon us, but was there ever a War without, is it not incident to human Affairs, did ever human foresight effectually guard against or prevent them? Much will happen be-fore seen, & often when seen difficult to apply the remedie; they have been greatily reduced in a year or two past, but still when we take a survey of the list, we are surprised, both in the Civil Military & Staff, the increase has principally Arose from two things especially in our Army, the First was owing to the gradual depreciation of our paper Currency, which tho not publickly declared, yet soon felt by our Army, as it would not then do to talk of Depreciation, & making that good, it inforced a constant & gradual rise of pay, Wages, increase of rations, Subsistance &c, & when once obtained then Claimed of right, if taken away or Diminished, Mutiny and dessertion to follow. The second was want of solid money, & delay of payment & the Consequent sufferings of the Army for want of Cloathing, the Comforts, & sometimes even Necessaries of life, and Nothing to satisfye but New and large promises, which tho easily made, & the Necessity of the times drew on, yet not so easily performd; & tho securities were given to make good, yet grievous Complaints that for want of Credit in Continental or State securities, they were oblidged to part with them at great loss & discount; on these Considerations And on Account of their long services mostly in the prime of their Years they Claimed the engagement of Congress for half pay for life; however Imprudent Congress might have been to enter into those engagements at that time, yet it was Insisted they could not now recede from them, when their Claims at the present for all the foregoing reasons have an Additional force & weight on the principles of Justice & Equity; Therefore looking upon it no doubt that the War was nearly at a Close & when they were soon to be disbanded, and scattered in distant parts throughout the Country, & knowing that the half pay for life was very disagreable to several of the States they proposed and ap-  plied for a Commutation for full pay for a certain Number of years after the War in Lieu of half pay for life, the Matter was taken up by Congress and five years was agreed upon for the time, if the Commutation was to take place; those States who had allways opposed half pay for life proposed to have the affair referrd to each State to take up the matter for their own line, that was Negatived. Then the Question was, whether they should Continue on half pay for life, which Congress could not Violate, or agree to 5 Years full pay in lieu thereof, to which 8 States & an half agreed out of 12 present, but as it requir-ed Nine, & I had given my Negative it rested only on my single Vote to Negative, or affirm.(1) Massachusetts one of the Principle of the New England States were in the affirmative. It truly threw me into a good deal of perplexity to put a Negative on so many States. The matter soon spread in the City, and Among the officers here, & immediately Communicated to the Army, whereby I found the whole Weight of all their resentments As well as others who were fond of the measure fell wholly on me and the great Majority of Congress pressing me on the Subject as what alone would quiet & pacifye the Army, And taking into Consideration the Alternative, as the half pay for life must remain unless this proposal took place, and considering the great aversion in several States to the half pay establishments; & which I had great reason to fear, would affect every proposed tax or fund for our publick Debt, and embarrass that, as well as other publick measure, & greatly tend to, if not finally Effect a disunion & dissolution of the body, after proposing some emendation which I thought necessary, & which would be more equal, & to fix the Commencement of the 5 Years for the deranged officers, to Commence from the time of their Derangement and imagining those States would on the whole esteem this much preferable to the half pay for life, I finally (to give satisfaction) moved for a reconsideration and brot the Question up again and gave my Vote in the affirmative which Closed the affair. As I am sensible it will be Considered as a matter of Importance, and as I was in a particular and singular situation & knowing myself to be the Object in publick pointed at, & whose conduct had been and imagine will still be much Canvassed in this affair, I thought it my duty to give your Excellency & my Constituents a more particular detail of the Subject than otherwise I should have done & Submit the whole to their Candor. Congress have been for a long time considering and Debating on the most proper, sure & effectual mode of restoring their Credit on their Securities, allready given and still to be given as fast as the Debts can be Liquidated and setled; as we are sensible the principal cannot at present be paid, and but very gradually lessned, & which at present both foreign & Domestic taking in the Army are Computed at between thirty & fourty millions of dollars, tho I am persuaded when the advancements made by the several States are taken in, they must ex APRIL 12, 1784  ceed 40 millions; the great object at present is to secure the interest on a Stable footing, which is the only thing can satisfye the Creditors when as their principall cannot be paid as it will enable those who are under a Necessity for their principal to part with and transfer their Securities for at least near the full Value: the Intrest is at present Computed at 2 millions & a half which must some how or another be Annually raised by the 13 States. They are convinced this cannot be done by the Usual mode of Taxation, the People cannot yeild to it, therefore we are necessitated again to Attempt an Impost appropriating of it absolutely to the interest, unless when it may exceed, the surplus then to be applied to the Principal & for a Limited Time, which is apprehended will remove the principal objections formerly made, but as the Impost is but small Viz not more than 3d upon a gallon of Rum, & about in that proportion (which for my own part I wished to have been much higher & which I apprehend would be the most easy & effectual way to provide for the Intrest) it will not amount to more than a Million dolls per Annum. Therefore Congress propose recommending to the several States to provide for the raising each one their proportion of a million and a half more per Annum in such way and mode as they think proper, and in order to proportion that sum, they are at length brought to believe that the mode proposed by Confederation which is by an Estimation of the true Value of the rea1 property Viz Lands & buildings in each State to be Impracticable & if attempted would be Attended with such Numerous frauds & partiallity as would Create the greatest dissatisfaction, and frustrate every attempt that could be made in that way. And therefore have agreed to recommend to the several States to adopt the rule of the Number of Inhabitants in each State on which to Ground & Estimate their several proportions. This no doubt will be more readily come at and truly ascertained than the other tho it should not be adjudged so equal & just. It is the rule which all the New England States preferrd at the time the Articles of Confederation were Under Consideration, & believe will now be esteemd preferable to the Other. These matters are not yet fully concluded & finished, As the Welcome News of Peace has called off our Attention for a few days to lessen & retrench our present enormous expenditures for the Army, Navy, Prisoners of War &c &c. When we shall Imediately return to Close the Affair & send it out for the Consideration of the Several States.  I am very sorry my intelligence of the resolution of Congress with respect to the States settling the Accounts with their several and respective lines of the Army & giving security to them did not arrive before the same was Compleated with our Line, & before our Assembly had risen, I sent it as soon as possible except I had sent an express on purpose but I see no otherway for Justice to be done which can be obtained, but for the State to have that account & the amount of it sent forward to Congress, & to get it, recievd, secured & funded on Intrest  to the State in the same manner as it must have been done to the Connecticut line, the same as with the rest of the Army if Connecticut had not done it for them. If so the Intrest will be stopd in the State yearly with which they can pay the Interest on the securities they have given, the difficulty is we cannot prevail on the other States to pay of & secure their lines in the manner & up to the time we have done ours--tho New Hampshire have proceeded as far as Connecticut, Massachusetts are taken in for about six months, and believe Pensylvania the same. We had prepared a proclamation for a Fast When the News arrived of Peace which brot us to doubt of the propriety of sending of it out to the several States, as the course of Providence rather pointed out to us a day of Thanksgiving & praise to Amighty God on this great and Important Event, & which I conclude will soon be agreed upon & Transmitted. The Proclamation for Peace with the official account thereof have been sent you by express by our Secretary of Foreign affairs which trust you will recieve before this comes to hand.  Your Excellcy. will be Sensible that the late great Change of our Affairs now calls off the attention of Congress from War to reduce back to regularity & order on a Peace Establishment. This I perceive is no small task. You have allready been informed of the Temper or disposition of our Army by what I last wrote & sent you. The War is happily at an end, the Army will have a months pay sent them, but it has been Impossible to settle up their Accounts to this time or give them Security yet they say they expect Congress will not disband them till all is done which cannot be in some months, are they to be kept up on pay and rations till that time or plunder for their support? I hope not; We have sent Genll Lincoln our Secretary at War a Prudent and discreet Gentleman who we hope with the Wisdome And Prudence of our Commander in Cheif will reduce matters to order there, and soon relieve us from the heavy expence. May God who has Caused the Warrs to Cease from abroad, restore & Confirm internal Peace, order, & harmony, & dispose us all to a Gratefull Acknowledgement of His Abundant goodness to a sinfull & undeserving People, & to that repentance, obedience, and Righteousness which will Exalt & Establish a Nation.

He moved therefore that the Come. sd. be instructed to prepare a general report for that purpose.  Mr. [Madison] & Mr. Fitzimmons thought it wd. be proper to be very circumspect in fettering our trade with stipulations to foreigners, that as our stipulations wd. extend to all the possessions of the U.S. necessarily--& those of foreign Nations havg. colonies to part of their possessions only; and as the most favd. nations enjoyd greater privileges in U.

Several members were extremely urgent on this point from motives of conomy, others doubted whether Congs. were bound thereto, & if not bound whether it would be proper. The first question depended on the import of the provisional articles, which were very differently interpreted by different members.

  Monday April 14. [1783] The Committee on the report of Secretary of foreign affrs. reported as follows, Mr. Hamilton dissenting:(1) 1. That it does not appear that Congress are any wise bound to go into the ratification proposed. \""The Treaty\"" of which a ratification is to take place, as mentioned in the 6th of the provisional articles, is described in the title of those articles to be \""a Treaty of peace proposed to be concluded between the Crown of G. B and the said U. S. but which is not to be concluded until terms of peace shall be agreed upon between G. B. & France;\""(2) The act to be ratified therefore is not the provl. articles themselves; but an act distinct, future, and event contingent. Again altho' the Declaratory act entered into on the 20th Jany. last, between the American & British Plenipotentiaries relative to a cessation of hostilities, seems to consider the contingency on which the provl. articles were suspended as having taken place, yet that act cannot itself be considered as the \""Treaty of peace meant to be concluded[\""]; nor does it stipulate that either the provl. articles or the act itself should be ratified in America; it only engages that the U. S. shall cause hostilities to cease on their part, an engagement which was duly fulfilled by the Proclamation issued on the 11th instant--lastly it does not appear from the correspondence of the American Ministers, or from any other information either that such ratification was expected from the U. S. or intended on the part of G. B., still less that any exchange of mutual ratifications has been in contemplation. APRIL 14, 1783  2. If Congress are not bound to ratify the articles in question, the Come. are of opinion that it is inexpedient for them to go immediately into such an act; inasmuch as it might be thought to argue that Congress meant to give to those articles the quality & effect of a definitive Treaty of peace with G. B. tho' neither their allies nor friends have as yet proceeded farther than to sign preliminary articles; and inasmuch as it may oblige Congs. to fulfil immediately all the stipulations contained in the provl. articles tho' they have no evidence that a correspondent obligation will be assumed by the other party.  3. If the ratification in question be neither obligatory nor expedient, the Come. are of opinion, that an immediate discharge of all prisoners of war on the part of the U.S. is premature and unadvisable; especially as such a step may possibly lessen the force of demands for a reimbursement of the sums expended in the subsistance of the prisoners.  Upon these considerations the Come. recommend that a decision of Congs. on the papers referred to them be postponed. On this subject a variety of sentiments prevailed:  Mr. Dyer, on a principle of frugality was strenuous for a liberation of the Prisoners.  Mr. Williamson thought Congs. not obliged to discharge the prisoners previous to a definitive treaty, but was willing to go into the measure as soon as the public honor would permit. He wished us to move pari passu with the British Commander. He suspected that that place (3) would be held till the interests of the Tories should be provided for. Mr. Hamilton contended that Congress were bound by the tenor of the Provl. Treaty immediately to Ratify it and to execute the several stipulations inserted in it; particularly that relating to discharge of Prisoners.(4) Mr. Bland thought Congs. not bound.  Mr. Elseworth was strenuous for the obligation and policy of going into an immediate execution of the Treaty. He supposed that a ready & generous execution on our part wd. accelerate the like on the other part.  Mr. Wilson was not surprized that the obscurity of Treaty sd. produce a varity of ideas, thought upon the whole that the Treaty was to be regarded as \""contingently definitive.\""  The Report of the Come. being not consonant to the prevailing sense of Congs. it was laid aside.

  Sir, Philadelphia, April 15. 1783 There are two resolutions passed relative to the restoration of the British Prisoners and to making arrangements for the surrender of the posts in the possession of the British troops, the first of which is to be transacted by you in conjunction with the secretary of War--the latter by yourself alone.(1) I will explain to you some doubts which have arisen in Congress with regard to the true construction of the provisional treaty--which may be of use to you in transacting the business abovementioned.  The sixth article declares that there shall be no future confiscations &c after the ratification of the treaty in America; and the seventh article makes the surrender of prisoners, evacuation of posts, cessation of hostilities &c. to depend on that event to wit--the ratification of the treaty in America. Now the doubt is whether the treaty means the provisional treaty already concluded or the definitive treaty to be concluded. The last construction is most agreeable to the letter of the provisional articles--the former most agreeable to the usual practice of nations; for hostilities commonly cease on the ratification of the preliminary treaty. There is a great diversity of Opinion in Congress. It will be in my opinion adviseable, at the same time that we do not communicate our doubts to the British, to extract their sense of the matter from them.  This may be done by asking them at what periods they are willing to stipulate the surrender of posts, at the same time that they are asked in what manner it will be most convenient to them to receive the prisoners.  If they postpone the evacuation of the different posts to the definitive treaty we shall then be justified in doing the same with respect to prisoners. The question will then arise whether on principles of humanity oeonomy and liberality we ought not to restore the prisoners at all events without delay. Much may be said on both sides. I doubt the expedience of a total restoration of prisoners 'till they are willing to fix the epochs at which they take leave of us. It will add considerably to their strength, and accidents though improbable may happen. I confess however I am not clear in my opinion.  I have the honor to be yr. Excellency's Most Obed serv  A Hamilton [P.S.] The provisional or preliminary treaty is ratified by us--for the greater caution.(2) ""

  Dr. Sr. Philada. 15th Apr. 1783. I am obliged to get from Mr. Minor for want of a remittence from the Treasurer the Sum of six hundred and fifty dollars for which I have given him an order on the Treasurer payable to Col. Monroe on order to be transmitted by the Post to you to be applied for by Col. Monroe or yourself as you shall see best. Should the Treasurer have made me a remittance to that amount before the bill reaches you I request you will suppress the bill as I shall repay the money here to Mr. Minor before his departure; if no such remittance is made or part only is remitted you will please to make use of the Bill for the whole or such part as may not be remitted. I have written to the Treasurer and Col. Monroe upon this business.(1) I have heard nothing further of Poquet. It is probable he will soon be here as the Prisoners are or about to be released at N. York in consequence of the signing and ratification of the preliminary articles of peace official acct. of which they lately received. I am in hopes something may be done in this business before Mr. Minor sets out. I have yours inclosing Genl.

I shall however inquire ab. it and if I think it proper shall make use of the letter.

  My dear Sir Philada. Apl. 15. 1783. My letter by a private hand who left this place a few days ago together with late public letters will have fully apprized you of the decisive events which have taken place in favor of peace.(1) The paper inclosed will amuse you with the bickerings in the British Parliament on that subject.  Genl. Carlton is very importunate for an immediate execution of the provisional articles on the part of Congress in the two points of liberating the prisoners, and recommending restitution to the Loyalists. On his part he has set the example in the first point, but says nothing of executing the other important conditions which are in our favor. This proposition has led Congs. into a critical discussion of the import of the provl. articles, in which the opinions are almost as numerous as the articles themselves.(2) Some think that the instrument was converted by the signature of preliminary articles between F. & G. B. into the Treaty of peace, of which a ratification in America is alluded to in the 6 art: others think that it was conditioned no otherwise on terms of peace between those powers, than that such an agreement rendered it a lawful & necessary foundation for a Treaty of peace between the U.S. & G. B. Some again suppose that the provl. arts need no ratification from Congs. but that they ought to wait for the Treaty to be grounded on them. Others suppose that a ratification is essential, or at least proper. The latter description again are divided, some proposing to ratify them as articles still contingent, others to ratify them as having taken effect in consequence of the preliminary articles between G. B. & F. This variety & contrariety of interpretations arise in great measure from the obscurity & even contrariety of the articles themselves.  Mr. Jefferson left us on Saturday last & will probably be with you by the time this gets to hand.(3) I am Dr Sir &c &c. J. M. ""

  Sr Philadelphia April 16th 1783  I have been honord with your Excellencys two favors of the 31st Ultimo and the 4th Inst (1)the latter accompanied with your full and explicit answer on the Subject on which I addressed your Excellency in my last at the request of the Committe.(2) It has been according to your desire communicated to Col. Hamilton and the other Members who compose the Committe confidentially and is now under consideration. We have conferred with the Superintendant of Finance,)(3) and be assured our utmost endeavors shall not be wanting to bring to a Speedy (and I hope happy conclusion) the objects Your Excellency has pointed to with so much clearness, candor & Energy. Confident I am that there is every disposition in Congress to Appreciate the Services and sufferings of the Army. Unquestionably the most meritorious Class of Citizens in this long & at length, Successful Contest. I am not less persuaded in my own mind, that what depends on the States respectively to put the finishing hand to a complete compensation of their long and meritorious Services and Sufferings will be cheerfully complied with; But these Sr. are the Expectations or APRIL 16, 1783  opinions, of an Individual strongly impressed and ardently (perhaps too sanguinely) hoping for that desireable event, in which Expectation if I am disappointed--I shall, with you Sr., have to lament, the most fatal Infatuation, and the grossest ingratitude that ever Seized the heads or corrupted the hearts of a Nation and its Councils towards a Body of men to whom they owe their Political existence and all those blessings which every good Man wishes to see flow from our Union and Independa[nce]. We hope to have the Answer to morrow from the Superintendant of Finance, on the Practicability of the Measure(4)--which shd. it be even in the negative (which I do not expect) I think I can assure your Excellency--Such is the Interest the Committe takes in the Welfare of the Army, that they will not stop in their Endeavors, to devise such measures as may in the end, prove as beneficial and Satisfactory as those which Yr. excellency has thought of if in their Powers.(5) Yr. Excelly's observations on the necessity of Establishing a National Character Stampd with the indelible traits of Justice, Gratitude and Faith, and carry with them the irrestible force of conviction and meet with my most cordial concurrance nor have I a doubt, that, when the Tumult of War has subsided, but this Enlightend Country altho at present young in Politics--will soon discover the Importance and truth of your observation, and adopt it as the surest Basis on which, must be founded the future greatness and Prosperity of these rising and important States. It is with Infinite pleasure that I think I have observed, such Ideas, succeeding rapidly, to those of Chicane, which so strongly marked, the Councils as well as Manners of the People at large in the days of Paper and Depreciation--from these considerations, I am led to form the most pleasing Augury of our future greatness and respectability among Nations, which has in a great measure dispelld those fears and Bodings of the evils, which a Joining of Interests among so many Sovereignties, United in one federal chain seemed to threaten. I am happy to think, that local Interests and prejudices will give way to a great and general good when clearly seen and well understood--and prudently and constitutionally persued. These Sr. are in my Apprehension the grand objects of our general Council; a steady persuit of which without turning to the right or to the left, from local considerations, party animosity, partial views, or Corrupt Influence, will certainly guide the Vessel of the State to a Safe Anchorage, and reward the Pilots with the Estimation and approval of their fellow Citizens and the Admiration and respect of foreign Powers.  I am happy to Inform Yr. Excellency that a requisition to the States, on such principles as the federal constitution will Authorize if adopted, and on such liberal principles as I hope will facilitate if not insure the adoption, is now so far advanced as to be on the point of its passage through Congress, which will afford the means of Providing   ample and permanent funds for the payment of the Interest not only of our army but of foreign and domestic creditors of every description, as well as for sinking the Principal. I cannot, here, omit suggesting to Yr. Excelly. that your personal Interest with some of the leading Members of our Legislature, and perhaps with some of the other States, might give a happy turn to those requisitions, when they are laid before the assemblies, especially if grounded on the feelings and true Situation of the Army with which you Sr. are universally acknowledged to be better acquainted, and more conversant than any other person can possibly be. Embarked in the Same cause, and I flatter myself on the same principle as Yr. Excellency--I hope I need not apologize for the length of my letter, as its contents will fully demonstrate the Interests I have in the Successful Issue of our common Endeavors that peace shall not arrive without its Blessings--content and happiness to those by whose exertions it has been pricipally procured--nor need I give an additional proof, I hope, of that entire confidence and esteem with which I am, Yr.

  My Dear Sir. Philada. April 16th, 1783.  I have lately been favor'd with an address of yours, without date, therefore, am not able to determine how well you regarded your promise, but it wou'd be difficult to convince me, that you do not always strictly adhere to the same.  I have my expectations raised, respecting your publication,(1) which you are pleased to mention, for if I form a judgement from the opinion I have of the author, I should suppose it will answer very valuable purposes; & the publication of Peace I believe will reach you, before I shall be favor'd with your performance. The brass case you mentioned contained little more than we had received before; but no doubt dispatches appearing in such a formal manner ought to be forwarded immediately, especially in a time of war.  We have now to contend with a large national debt & little money to pay or funds to secure payment, yet you think \""requisitions\"" will do better than \""Congressional taxes.\"" I shou'd differ from you in opinion if the latter was Constitutional, but is it not our duty to recommend to the several states what we are convinced is most for the ease & benifit of the good people, 'tho' it is not in the method pointed out by the <<Constitution> Confederal Union. If they don't think so, they will not comply with the measures, but the time may soon come when they will be convinced, that they can't pay this debt, nor do justice to their creditors, without an impost & excise, & that the laws of the several states ought to be similar for manifest reasons; but I find there will be different opinions, respecting the meeting of such comittees, as you are pleased to mention, whether that method will be strictly Constitutional; but your opinion had so far engaged my attention, that I had like not to have congratulated you on the return of Peace, which I APRIL 16, 1783  most heartily do, & what adds to this happy & glorious event, is that we have obtained all that cou'd reasonably be expected.

  April the 16th 1783  The undersigned delegates in Congress from the State of North-Carolina beg leave to represent, that some time in the year 1780 application was made by the honourable Abner Nash esquire then Governor of the State of North-Carolina to the British Commandant at Charlestown for leave to send cloathing and other articles which might be acceptable and afford relief to the North-Carolina prisoners who were confined there; That leave for that purpose was obtained from General Patterson the then British Commandant as appears by two letters which we have the honour to lay before Congress.  That in consequence of such permission a Flag schooner, called the Adventure, loaded with thirty six hogsheads of tobacco and sundry other articles, having on board some British prisoners of war, sailed from Beaufort in North Carolina on the 9th of June 1781 for Charlestown (This was the third vessel that had been sent with similar supplies the two first were properly recieved) That on the 20 of the said month, near the bar of Charlestown, the said Schooner was seized by a British ship of war, the Cormorant; and sent into the harbour no regard being paid to the Flag under which she sailed nor the permission that had been granted; and altho complaint thereof was made to the Commandant (who we believe on enquiry will be found to have highly disapproved the seizure) yet no part of the Schooner or her cargo was recovered.

  Friday April 18. [1783] Application was made from Council of Pa. for determination of Congs. as to the effect of the acts terminating hostilities, on Acts to be inforced during the war. Congs. declined giving any opinion.(1) The motion of Mr. Bland (2) raised a long debate. In favor of the motion it was urged by Mr. Rutlidge that the proposed Cession of Va. ought to be previously considered & disallowed; that otherwise a renewal of the recomendation wd. be offensive; that it was possible the Cession might be accepted in which case the renewal wd. be improper. Virga. he observed alone could be alluded to as having complied in part only. Mr. Wilson went largely into the subject. He said If the investigation of right was to be considered, the U.S. ought rather to make cessions to individual States then receive Cessions from them, the extent of the Territory ceded by the Treaty being larger than all the States put together; that when the claims of the states come to be limited on principles of right, the Alleghany Mountains would appear to be the true boundary--this could be established without difficulty before any Court--or the Tribunal of the World. He thought however policy reqd. that such a boundary sd. be established as wd. give to the Atlantic States access to the Western Waters. If accomodation was the object, the clause ought by no means to be struck out.

  My dear Brother. Philadelphia Aprill 22d 1783 I duly recd your favr. of the 17th and do again most sincerely rejoice with you on the kindness of divine Providence towards you. The Health of our Sister on this Occasion increases the Cause for Joy & thankfulness.(1) I will speak to Mr F. & acquaint you with his directions as to Mr Crane, his Conduct in denying the Bond has alarmed me much, as I am clear it was not the effect of forgetfulness, as it is but a little before my leaving home, that I conversed with him about the Payment. If he will give you satisfactory Security & pay the Interest, you may accept it, otherwise I must beg you will proceed. I do not want the principal immediately. I am in doubt about T. Balls Bond, and will leave it till I see you. Monsr Viellon's Cause is to be tried to morrow--the poor fellow is almost crazy & if he looses it, I am afraid he will destroy himself, as he is poor beyond Measure. Your Sister & Susan join me in kind Love to your Rib & Mrs.  Smith. Kiss the little Stranger for us. I had forgot to tell you that Sir Guy will go more speedily that you suppose. I am my Dr Brother, Yours Afftly, E.B.  [P.S.] I desire Dickey to speak to you about his being with you this Summer. If he is not kept close at writing the Common Business of an Office, and that very speedily, he will never be a Man of Business. He wants it more than Study, and indeed it is absolutely necessary.

  My dear Sir, Philadelphia 22d April 1783 I highly approve your Plan of rejoicing, illuminating &c &c. upon Condition that you do literally fulfill your proposed plan, of firing \""The Buildings & the Contents\"" as this would fully prove you a determined & resolute Whig and entitle you to equal Canonization with King Taminy, who when advanced in Age, and expected at a Treaty held in this City with the Indians, finding himself weary with the Journey and not able to travel farther, stopped in a wigwam near Grme Park and fastening all the avenues to it, set fire to the Wigwam and burned it up \""with the Contents\"". Now after you perform so heroical an Act, you also shall be dubbed St. Lewes. I hope you will not insist on the Madam's turning Bramin & attending her Husband on the furneral Pile. Pray also send Old Mama to wait on the Madam, lest she should shew her Whiggism too. The little Prince must also be excepted. You have sold the Stack of Hay well, but am afraid they will [not?...] at Morris Town for a Jew. As to Henry Breene the less you have to do with him the better. It can but be lossed at the worst, and that will assuredly be the Case if he has it. I should not choose the Horses should be sent to Burrows at the Price he asks; as if you leave Baskinridge, it will be hard if we cannot get somebody to take them for their work. However I leave it to you. I should think I could get £20--in Cash a piece, perhaps on 6 Months Credit something more. But I am determined to take what can be got. The Cash would be best, if under price. APRIL 22, 1783  As to the Lands, I can see no need to sell them unless they will bring at least 40/ per Acre, some of them I would not take under £10 per Acre. They are Lands of the highest Quality. When you want the Cash I have a number of Bonds & Mortgages of Ld. Drummonds that I will call in & pay your Debt. As to the Wines, they will be all confiscated, and your only remedy will be an Application to the Legislature on the circumstances of the Case, and these are not favourable, as they are the Property of Thompson. You had best have them assigned to you in Security for the Debt & Ship them immediately to this City, before the Evacuation. Auth can do this in your Name--and you can be here to recieve them. I have got a Letter from Marsden also. I wish to see you on his Acct. If you go in, Permission must be had from Govr Livingston. If you should go, you had best see me first. Sir Guy has applied to Congress to send in Commrs. to superintend the evacuation &c as he is preparing.(1) He wishes to have it known that the Articles of the Peace is fully complied with. Mr. Forman is in New York. If you purchase a Vessel she must be sent away previous to the Evacuation.

I did not fail to pr- APRIL 22, 1783  esent as you desired your particular compliments to {Miss K.(1) Your inference on that subject was not groundless. Before you left us I had sufficiently ascertained her sentiments. Since your departure}(2) the {affair has been pursued. Most preliminary arrangements, although definitive, will be postponed untill} the {end of} the {year in congress.(3) At some period of} the {interval I shall probably make a visit to Virginia}. The {interest which your friendship takes on this occasion in my happiness is a pleasing proof that} the {dispositions which I feel are reciprocal}.(4) The report on funds &c. passed Congress on Saturday last (5) with the dissent of R. Island and the division of N. York only. The latter vote was lost by the rigid adherence of Mr. Hamilton to a plan which he supposed more perfect. The clause providing for unauthorized expenditures, could not be reinstated, and consequently no attempt was made to link all the parts of the act inseparably together. As it now stands it has I fear no bait for Virga. which is not particularly interested either in the object or mode of the revenues recommended, nor in the territorial cessions, nor in the change of the constitutional rule of dividing the public burdens. A respect for justice, good faith & national honor is the only consideration which can obtain her compliance. We have recd. no intelligence from abroad which deserves to be noted, since your departure. The interval between the preliminary & definitive Treaties has produced several nice & interesting questions. One is whether laws prohibiting commerce with British Ports during the war, have expired with the cessation of Hostilities. A similar one is whether the soldiers enlisted for the war are entitled to a discharge. At least half of the army under Genl. Washington are under this description and are urgent for such a construction of their engagements. A third question is whether the preliminary treaty beween F. & G. B. has given such effect to the provisional articles between the latter & the U. S. as to require an execution of the stipulations in the 6 & 7 artcs. or whether a definitive Treaty only can produce this effect. The system for foreign affairs is not yet digested: and I apprehend will be long on the anvil, unless the actual return of our Ministers from Europe should stimulate Congs. on the subject. I am charged with many compliments from the whole family for yourself & Miss Patsy, which you will accept with an assurance of sincere friendship from Yr Obt. & Hbl servt. J. Madison Jr. ""

  My dear Sir Philada. Apl. 22. 1783. The mail of yesterday like the preceding one broungt [brought] no letter from you. I just understand that a Frigate from France is at Chester, but what intelligence she brings & particularly whether she brings a definitive peace is unknown. Several interesting questions are raised on the Preliminary Treaty. First whether laws prohibiting British Commerce & which were to be in force during the war are repealed or not? Another of a similar nature is whether the enlistments for the war are to be terminated by the latter or former Treaty? Half the army under Genl. Washington is computed to be interested in this question. The Report for establishing a Revenue &c. passed Congs. on Saturday. It has been defalcated of several clauses which were material, and which would have touched in particular the supposed interest of Virga. Mr. Jefferson carried with him a copy of the plan as originally reported, and as it stood when he left us. It has undergone no material variation from the latter stage of it. ""

Our Hartford acquaintance here I see almost every day--they are all well & frequently enquiring after you, & it will be a great pleasure to them I doubt not to have so good an account of you as I hope it will soon be in my power to give them. I went last evening to Mr. Laws singing entertainment which was performed before a great concourse of people assembled upon a general invitation. The performance was decent & a considerable improvement on the singing here; but not equal to what we have in many parishes in Connecticut. He has not met with proper encouragement--his schollars are but few--the young folks here are more fond of dancing than singing--& many of the old ones who care any thing about publick worship are alarmed at the Idea of admitting new tunes & a brisker air.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia April 23d. 1783. I hope you got safe home, & found your family well; & your self also in better health than is possible to be enjoyed in the fog of this city.  APRIL 23, 1783  Your recess from business, after long confinement, must, I think, affoard you some pleasure, & to see the fruits of your labors, peace & independance, much more. Congress, since you left it, has ratifyed the provisional treaty & ordered the prisoners to be released, & also that the publick Horses & other now useless property be sold; & have passd the report on revenue with the alteration of the duty on Salt to 5 Per Ct. & the Duty on all wines, except Mideira which stands at 12/90, to 6/90 of a Dollar. We hear nothing more yet of the Definitive Treaty. Late private letters from Europe mention that preliminaries were not signed by the Dutch, but that they had at last recd. such offers from the british as the french court advised them to accept & there was no doubt but they would, also that they had appointed a Mr Van Bercle, their Ambassador to these States. A letter has been recd. from Mr. Dana at Petersburg of the 15th of Jany. He had not then assumed a publick character nor made any advances towards a treaty of commeree, nor indeed could make any to purpose till he should first pave the way according to the nigardly custom of that court, with about £10,000 Sterlg in presents to her ministers. He also thot. it very probable that a war would take place between Russia & the Porte, on account of the Khan of the Crimea who had been deposed by the Tartars of that Independancy. Sir Guy Carleton has written to Congress to appoint a person to attend at N York to see the 7th article of the treaty relating to American property duly observed, as he expects soon to begin an embarcation. The Tories are mostly gone from there to Nova-Scotia, cursing their King all the way. I enclose you some newspapers & two letters brot. for you by the last eastern post. Col.

We also Communicate to your Excellency in Confidence, that there is a Doubt as to the true construction of the Preliminary Articles to wit: Whether the evacuation of the posts & the other matters mentioned in the 7th Article are to take place on the ratification of the preliminary; or Definitive treaty. This doubt, however, Congress are unwilling to bring into View; the measures taken by the enclosed Resolutions will bring Genl. Carleton to an Explanation--perhaps the Ambiguity of Sir Guy's Conduct may be attributed to the same doubt. There is a frigate arrived from France which left Rochefort the 14th March.

It seems the Dutch had not yet made their peace, but the Count de Vergennes Considers the terms last offered by England as Reasonable Enough; and it is, therefore, probable that Matter will soon have been brought to a close.

I hope you will not be displeased with my Conduct.

Our Circumstances afford an odd Contrast to those we have heretofore experienced. The Difficulty which heretofore oppress'd us was how to raise an Army. The one which now embarrasses is how to dissolve it. Every thing Congress can do for the Satisfaction of our deserving Soldiers will be done.

  Sir, Philadelphia April 23d. 1783. Congress on the 18th instant completed their Resolution for recommending to the several States to pass Laws for granting an Impost, an Excise, and to change an Article of the Confederation--a Copy of which we do ourselves the Honor to enclose.(1) To produce this in its present Form has been a Work of Time. It has engaged the Attention of Congress chiefly, since the commencement of the Year everything has been suggested and done to endeavor to take off the Objections, and render it palable to the several States which could be done consistently with a fixed Determination of preserving to Congress a Power to Collect and Appropriate the Revenues; the latter is restrained to particular Objects, and the whole limited as to Time. It would have been less exceptionable to us, had the Officers for collecting the Revenues been under the Controul as well as the Appointment of the State; And we conceive the Appointment of Officers for Twenty-five Years incompatible with the Constitution of the State, which requires all Officers to be chosen annually. We are also at a loss to reconcile the Idea of Appointing Officers; which when made immediately become independent of their Makers, with the Principles of Liberty. But we are happy that it will be submitted to the Consideration of an Assembly, whose Deliberations on former Occasions have been marked with wisdom, and discovered a thorough knowledge of their Constitutional Rights, as a most striking and honorable Testimony of which we appeal to the difference between the present and former Resolution on this Subject. APRIL 23, 1783  If it should be the Opinion of the Assembly to adopt the Resolution generally, we take the Liberty to mention that a Deviation so far as relates to the Controul of the Officers may be made, with a probability of its being acquisced in--by Congress; and if this was to be done in the New-England States, it would be a grand additional guard to the Rights of the States--a matter of the highest Importance, and which requires to be kept in constant view. During the Time the Resolution was maturating, a Land-Tax of 6/, 3/ and 1/6 per hundred Acres was proposed and much contended for to make a part of the Act, but it met with such warm Opposition from the Western and largely Landed States, as prevented its being inserted and the Delegates from some of them explicitly declared that they never would consent to a Land Tax of any kind, but what should be to their own separate Advantage. The Affair of the Western Lands is a Subject which begs to force the Attention of Congress. Memorials for Grants have been already presented, it must be necessary therefore soon to ascertain the Line between the United States, and the individual States. Virginia yet continues her tender to cede the Land North of Ohio with some restrictions and Conditions. And We expect Congress will Accept it. The Massachusetts and Connecticut States will be again addressed on the Subject of Cessions, and also the Carolina's. Georgia is curtailed by the Treaty in favor of Spain so as to be able to spare little or none of her territorial Claim. The definitive Treaty has not yet arrived; several matters are before Committees relative to Arrangements which are deemed necessary to adopt upon its Arrival--particularly the forming Treaties with the Indians (who have lately been troublesome on the Frontiers, and have kill'd & taken about Thirty of the Inhabitants near Fort Pitt) and the fixing Military and naval Establishments during a Peace. This last is a very important matter, and of which we shall give the earliest Advice, as soon as the Report is given in. The disbanding the Army, is a matter of great Consequence. Those inlisted during the War, are already impatient to be discharged. The want of Money in the public Treasury to satisfy their moderate Claims on being discharged is a perplexing Circumstance, and throws Congress into a very disagreeable Dilemma, and must cause them unavoidably to incur very considerable extra Expences. However, we have reason to rely on the wisdom and goodness of that directing Hand, which has hitherto led through every gloom, removed every difficulty, and at length crown'd our Efforts and our wishes with Liberty and Independence to guide and direct us thro' the present puzzling mazes in which we are involved. We are with the highest respect for your Excellency & the Honorable Assembly, Your Excellency's Very humble servants, John Collins Jona Arnold APRIL 24, 1783  ""

  Dear General Philadelphia April 24th. 1783. Colo. Wood dissapointed me & left Town without my answer to the favor which you did me the honor to write me some time since, & the casual conveyances which chance offers to your part of the Country have not compensated for his neglect. The change in our circumstances which the late pacification has made, will now permit the Secretary of War to carry into immediate Execution a Resolve of Congress directing him to furnish the medals, voted to those whose distinguished merit has drawn that mark of Applause & gratitude from their Country during the late War.(1) You may depend on my attention to yours, & if I have any talents at (which by the way I doubt extremely) it shall be aided by the assistance of those, whose imagination I esteem as elegant as correct & I hope will eventually produce what ought to equal your expectation from the hands you have committed it to, if it does not merit your approbation. A late communication from the Comte de Vergennes, gives us every reason to expect a speedy completion of the definitive Treaty. The paper however which I do myself the honor to enclose contains a very interesting debate. You will observe that the supplies are voted for the ensuing year upon the War establishment, & it is plainly to be discovered that no orders had been sent to Sr. Guy Carleton for the evacuation of NYork, on the 3d of March. This corroborating suspicions which a studied ambiguity of expression & marked reserve in the communications of that Officer had before suggested--it will become a very serious step our compliance with the stipulations of the provisional Treaty on our part, particularly that Article which directs the liberation of Prisoners, the performance of which Sr. Guy presses with incessant ardor. The reinforcement of so formidable a force as they now hold in the heart of our Country with 6 or 8000 Men, woud be a perilous measure in the present disorder'd nay distracted state of our political systems. If we find that they hover over us to seize the first advantage which the paroxisms of dissapointment & disgust will occasion, it will then require every exertion of the real patriots to strengthen the hands of Government relaxed to a degree that borders on anarchy. The Councils of the United States are devoted to the grand objects of satisfying the demands of the Army & those public Creditors whose Zeal & confidence have animated them to exertions ruinous to themselves altho' contributing to the preservation of America. If they are properly supported, Union & harmony may spring  APRIL 28, 1783  from a permanent establishment of an happy govirnment enjoyed in peace abroad & at home. But if the separate States will pursue measures subversive of all public credit--& thwart the united Councils by municipal prejudices--our Revolution will be productive of scenes of confusion, destructive of foreign & domestic quiet. Your exertions in directing the views of the Virga line to the proper objects, have been similar to those that the General has with a degree of firmness alone equal to the task pursued in the grand Army--& their consequences will be not less beneficial to America than the most splendid military exertions. With sincere wishes for your Health & happiness, I am Dr General, yr. mo. Ob. Sert. John F. Mercer P.S. I had forgot to mention that the Court of Spain had at length recd.

The Bearer Colonel Ogden of the New Jersey Line,(1) a Gentleman who has been greatly distinguished for his Bravery & good Conduct, from the first commencement of the present War, having receivd the permission of Congress to make a Voyage to France, on his private concerns; I must take the Liberty to reccommend him to your Excellency's notice. He is of a good family in New Jersey, & having taken a very active part during the contest in this Country, deserves the favor & protection of every Friend to America. He is one of those brave officers who persevered in the Journey thro' the Wilderness to Quebec in the Year 1775, and was wounded in the attack on that City--he also bore a share in the Laurels of York Town. APRIL 28, 1783  I have the Honor of inclosing a Letter from the Commander in Chief,(2) which he has committed to my Care. We are in daily and anxious Expectation of the Definitive Treaty, having been a long time without advices from our ministers abroad, our last Letters being dated in February. The terms of Peace give universal Satisfaction here, except the article relative to English Debts, remaining silent, as to the time allowed our Citizens to make the payments. The situation of our Country--The property of the Whigs being in the Public Funds, not a farthing of which can be had--The great Losses from the depreciated money, and the stagnation of Trade for years past--make it absolutely necessary that three or four years should be allowed, for this purpose, on giving security for the Debts. If an immediate payment should be required, it will cast our Merchants so entirely into the power of the British Creditors as to be very injurious to the interests of France. I have the honor to be with the greatest respect & Esteem, Your Excellency's Most Obedt & very Hble Sert, Elias Boudinot ""

  My dear Sir Philada. Apl. 29. 1783 Yesterday's post was the third that has arrived successively without a line from you. The Definitive Treaty it is said is to be remitted to the two Imperial Courts for their approbation, before the last hand will be put to it. This will be a mere compliment however, and as the parties have settled their contests without their intermediation there can be no pretext if there were a disposition to meddle. It appears from English Gazettes that Shelburne has been so pressed by the unpopularity of some of the terms of peace, that he cd. not prevent a vote of the House of Commons declaring them to be disadvantageous & dishonorable. The consequence prognosticated is another change of the Administration in favor of North's & Fox's parties, who have made a common cause agst. Shelburne.

  Dear General. Philadelphia, April 29, 1783 My indisposition has in some measure decreased, notwithstanding the perpetual routine of public business, of a nature too interesting not to agitate, has prevented my regaining perfect health. By the papers, which are enclosed, you have a very interesting debate in the House of Commons, which will in some measure corroborate the hints which I dropt in my last (1)--the force of which would otherwise be diminshed by Sir Guy Carleton's last letter to Mr. Livingston, desiring the appointment of Commissioners to attend in New York, to the strict observance of that article of the provisional treaty, which relates immediately to the evacuation of the British posts. By this debate, it appears most clearly, that no orders had been sent to Sir Guy to leave New York, at that period, nor can we form any probable conclusion how long they shall continue him there, as they seem to connect his stay with the affairs of the Refugees. The vote of Parliament to continue a war establishment, induces a very serious consideration, how far it will be prudent and politic, to disband our troops and leave our Country defenceless and exposed, with so formidable a force in our bosom, restrained only by the faith which is due to a provisional treaty, certainly revocable at any moment, until a definite one shall be realized. The moment is critical, and demands the utmost exertions of those who are vested with confidential offices. I have a reliance in the prudence of Congress, who are really composed of members, at present, who rise in my estimation in proportion as our intimacy increases. For the present, adieu, and believe me, With much sincerity, Dear General, Y'rs, John F. Mercer P.S. Upon looking for your letter, to give an extract of it to Sterret, I find it mislaid.

  April [1783] In truth the French did not intend a Peace, but were surprised into it. The Count de Vergennes, when he politely consented that the American Commissioners should meet Mr. Oswald, relied wholly on the restrictions he conceived them to be under, of recurring to him for advice, well knowing that in every such recurrence he would have it in his power to defeat the Negotiation. He expected too that sufficient Obstructions would necessarily arise on the part of the British, especially as he himself encouraged them. He intended to have dragg'd America thro' another Campaign at least, and instead of leaving her in Circumstances from which she would rise and make a figure, he meant that she should be so fetter'd with Embarrassments that she must have continued, in a large degree, dependent on France. Had this been the case, the political Connection with that nation might have been indissoluble. It is to the Count's mistake of the Characters of the American Commissioners, particularly Mr. Jay, that we are in some measure indebted for the present pacification. Had he supposed they would have dared to construe their Instructions in the liberal manner they have done, he assuredly would never have trusted them with the Opportunity. Mr. Oswald, it appears, considered the Interest of the two Countries in the same light with Adams and Jay, every Essay of the French therefore to divert him from the purpose was vain and fruitless. But peace, however grateful it is to the many, causes great Chagrin to some in public life. We have a Junto here so completely inlisted in the French Service, and so closely attached to them by some invisible tie, that I almost despair of seeing a Separation. These men, like those whom they serve, have it now in view to deprive us of those inestimable Advantages which, if we act wisely, must result to us from the Peace. Their Object is, to prevent our forming any commercial Connection with any European Power, other than Spain and Sweden--these Courts being entirely under the French Management. To this end they have pressed the recall of Dana, Adams, &c. APRIL, 1783  and have urged that Instructions should be given to enter into no treaty nor even Conversation on the Subject. Dana might have finish'd a very advantageous one long ago, but for the French Minister, whom he was bound to obey. Every opposition from the same quarter was made to Mr. Adams in Holland, and it was their Policy which so exceedingly embarrassed Mr. Jay at the Court of Madrid. In a word, it is clear, by the advices from all our Ministers, except Dr. F____ that they oppose our Connection with any power but themselves. They meant to save us, but it was to themselves and for their own use. We are now told that they are justly entitled to a Monopoly of our Tobacco Trade--that 'tis the smallest Compensation we can make for their kindness and their Expence in saving us--and that their Farmers have made Arrangements, counting on the Benefits to arise from this exclusive Trade. But shall we give ourselves up to the Devil in this manner? Shall we neglect to avail ourselves of the Advantages within our Reach? Shall the Great Council of America discover less knowledge and less Virtue than their Servants have done in every line and every Character? Shall they at this stage of the business be the first to betray or relinquish the Interest of their Country? God forbid! For the honor of America, I hope it cannot happen. Our true Interest consists in avoiding too close a Connection with any Nation, and by pacific perseverance to derive commercial Benefits from all. And I trust there is still a Majority in Congress who think with me, and who, preferring the Interest of this Country, to that of any other, will pursue those measures that promise the advancement of it.(1) ""

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia May 6th. 1783. I am happy to find by your letter of the 25th of April, that you was safe home, & in perfect humour, & that you propose by & by, writing a treatise (1) to keep every body else so. A work of this kind well executed would be a valuable production to the world, & conduce more, I dare say, to the health & happiness of mankind, than a great deal that is spent for doctors & clergymen. I hope, Sir, you will send me one of the first impressions, which I shall certainly stand in need of if I do not get away from here sooner than there is at present a prospect of. But it seems, Sir, that you are not quite out of the noise of politicks tho' you are happily removed from this seat of them. That horrid clammor you speak of, about commutation, a mere change of a name indeed, tho' it excites neither the Idea of guilt or fear in your mind, does very illy become a people of sense, especially in the very moment of their salvation, when every heart & voice ought to be joined in praise. But so it is, Sir, the princes of the power of the air, can raise storms any time when they have occasion for them, having elements to work upon, which, like the raging sea that casteth up mire & dirt, are easily set in motion. We are not yet favoured with the difinetive treaty. The complesion of it is said, has been delayed for the approbation of the Emperor of Germany & the Emperess of Russia, or a compliment to MAY 6, 1783  them, I suppose, for having so far interested themselves as to offer their mediation to bring it about. General Washington & Sir Guy Carleton have an appointment to meet this day at Tappan, to confer about the evacuation of ports & other matters in the 7th article of the treaty. Nothing as yet appears to induce a suspicion that the treaty will fail of being carryied into execution on both sides as fast as the nature of the case will admit of. Certainly we cannot wish to see it violated & annulled, nor has Great Britain so much reason to be dissatisfied with it, under all circumstances, as North, Fox & their partisans pretend for, whose object probably is to hunt down the present minister & to transfer the popular odium from the criminal to the executioner. If Great Britain induced thereto by the folly of a former administration, must make us independant of herself, it is wise in her to do it with a grace, & in a manner that shall keep us also independant of France. This principle no doubt was well explained & enforced by Mssrs. Adams & Jay--but it would have been weakness in a British minister not to have adopted it, & in his large an extent, as in the present treaty seems to have been done. Even as to the Loyalists, which are said to have been sacrificed for nothing, I believe the true interest of the British nation is better secured by peopling a Colony with them, than it could have been by reinstating them with us. Their number is said to be near 30,000. A number of officers from Sir Guy Carleton are now in town going on to take charge of the british prisoners at Lancaster & elsewhere & conduct them by land to New York. Sir Gui expects soon to be superceeded or relieved by General Gray. Three months pay is like to be made to the Army when they shall be disbanded. One third in Cash & the rest in Mr. Morris's notes. He will continue in office until the engagements he shall enter into for this purpose, & those that he has already entered into which are not yet performed, shall be fulfilled. Congress are busy on the peace arrangements; and I now think will not have a recess the ensuing summer. Should this find you at Hartford, as I hope it will, I must beg your influence with Mr. Huntington to come forward to Congress as soon as he can, as Coll Dyer does not propose to stay much longer & there is danger of Congress being without a representation of nine states which would greatly embarras the business they have now generally to transact. I hope Mr Strong (2) or some other gentleman will also be ready to relieve me. I do not & dare not think of staying thro' the Summer. I was favoured with your letter from Danbury--which, as Brown was here, I omitted to answer till he should return, which did not happen till I recd your other letter of the 25th. I shall be very happy, Sir, to receive your letters as long as I stay here, & to merit the continuance of your confidence & friendship as long as I live.

  Dr. Sr. Philada. 6th May 1783. We have at length got through the plan of funds to be recommended to the States for their adoption.(1) It has been the most difficult & perplexing discussion of any that has engaged the attention of this body for some time. The various objects to be combined, and the different interests to be reconciled, to make the System palatable to the States was a wish not easily or speedily to be effected, and altho' it was the wish of many to settle the plan upon clear and unquestioned principles of finance, yet such were the prejudices of some States, and of some individuals, and such their jealousies, we were obliged to take a middle course with respect to its duration, and the appointment of Collecters, or hazard ultimately the loss of the measure. As it stands I believe it will answer the purposes intended, if the States will grant their concurrence--a Copy will be transmitted to you for yours and the Armys information. As the State of our finances at present is such as to make it difficult for the present officer now at the head of that departmt., much more so for any new hand who might succeed him, to form the necessary arrangemts. for obtaining money sufficient for disbanding the Army Mr. Morris has agreed to act untill that business is accomplished(2) and will I hope be able to effect it to the satisfaction of the Army--but from appearances the period of disbanding will be more distant that in any at first apprehended, if that measure, as it seems to be proper it shod., goes hand in hand with the evacuation of our Country by the British forces. By this time you are better able to judge of the views and designs of Sr. G. Carleton or of those who direct his movement as I presume the intended interview took place--tho' I confess I thought there was indelicacy in the manner of that Gentlemans mentioning his proposed attendants. In every thing else, but that of evacuation (and they may be doing all they can in that for any thing I know) they seem to act with fairness and liberality and I shod. be sorry to find them in that, or any other instance, practicing the old game of deception--we have reports something of this sort appears in their conduct  MAY 6, 1783  respecting the Negros in their possession claimed by our Citizens--these relations come from men of character and untill the contrary is ascertained of what they assert, credit will be given their reports.(3) No proclamations can authorize a refusal of property to those who claim under the article of the Treaty, and establish their right by satisfactory proof. Col. F. Thornton of Machadach about two years ago lost many of his Negros who went on board some of the British ships of war up Potomack, he wrote to me the other day ab. them--these I believe are not sanctioned by proclamation and yet I suspect if the old Gentleman was to send a person to claim them, his labour wod. be lost. If what we are told respecting the conduct of those in power in N. York concerning the claimed property of the American Citizens be true, it will prove an effectual bar to the restoration of confiscated Estates had there been a disposition in the States before to render them. I wish to have seen the treaty faithfully executed on both sides, but when arts and prevarication take place on one side, they are apt to prevail on the other. I proceed immediately to Virga. in order to attend the assembly now convening (4) and shall thank you for any information respecting these matters you can properly communicate--that the truth may be known, and misrepresentations if any prevail, removed. If any thing occurs to you which you do not choose to communicate directly to the Executive with respect to the arrangements necessary to be made on a peace, and shall confide them to me, proper attention shall be paid to your observations.

Floyd's family did not set out untill the day after it was received. I accompanied them as far as Brunswick, about 60 miles from this, and returned hither on Friday evening. Mr. Jones will attend the Assembly, and proposes to begin his journey this afternoon, if the present rain should cease.(2) Mr. Lee also means to set out for the same purpose in a few days.(3) {Congress have received a long and curious epistle from Mr. Adams dated in February addressed to the president not to the secretary for foreign affairs.(4) He animadverts on the revocation of his commission for a treaty of commerce with Great Britain, presses the appointment of a minister to that court with such a commission, draws a picture of a fit character in which his own likeness is ridiculously and palpably studi[e]d, finaly praising and recomending Mr. Jay for the appointment provided injustice must be done to an older servant.}(5) Letters from the Marquis de la Fayette and Mr. Carmichael shew that the Court of Spain has become pretty tractable since the acknowledgment of our Independence by G. B.(6) The latter has been treated MAY 6, 1783  with due respect, and the Court has agreed to accede to the territorial limit fixed for W. Florida in the provisional Articles. The navigation of the Mississippi remains to be settled. My absence from Congs. the past week disables me from giving you exact information of their latest proceedings. I am told that in consequence of {Mr. A____ letter the secretary of foreign affairs has been instructed to project a treaty of commerce with Great Britain} which will {probably bring the attention of Congress to the general department of foreign affairs.}(7) Under the same cover with this are two letters for Miss Patsy, one from Mrs. Trist, and the other from Miss Floyd with the copy of a song. I beg that my compliments may be accepted along with them. I am Dear Sir your sincere friend, J.Madison Jr.(8) ""

I had pushed the matter to the Extreem to prevent Judge Griffins resigna- MAY 6, 1783  tion, & after that to prevent his making a Journey to Virginia before your cause come on & by which means he tells me he has lost at least £400. I insisted on Judge Reeds Attendance on the 14th day of April & when all was done And the Courts meeting on that day Coll. Stantons Attorney here Viz Mr Lewis objected to the proceeding in the Cause on that day for that after the appointment of the Court to be held on the 14th & Judge Griffen having recievd letters from Mr Lowell & Mr Reed that they could not attend till the 1st Monday in May & in Consequence thereof had sent to Rhodisland & Boston that the Court would not be held till that time which had prevented Genll Varnum, Coll Stantons Attorney his coming forward & therefore he was not prepared to proceed. We found the Court inclined to postpone the Matter till that time & it was feard if we pressed the matter too hard it might prejudice the Court & endanger the Merits whereupon it was Yielded to Assign the Cause for a hearing on the first Monday in May provided Mr Lewiss should write to Genll Varnum or Coll Stanton to delay the execution till a Trial could be had which he engaged to do when the 1st Monday in May Arrived Mr Lowel from Boston was here & your cause was to have come on but Unhapily Judge Griffin was Very Unwell & no Court could be held that day for Mr Lowell could not take his seat till he had got through some causes he was concerned in.

  Sir, Philadelphia, May 13th, 1783 Little has occurred here worth your Excellency's notice since Colo. Dyer addressed you by Messenger Brown.(1) An interview has been had between General Washington & Sir Guy Carleton at Orange-town, for sundry purposes relating to the execution of the 7th article of the provisional treaty. Every assurance is given by the Latter that New York with Penobscot shall be evacuated as soon as the Shipping necessary for that purpose can be procured, which he has sent for. Commissioners on the part of the United States are appointed to superintend, with others on the part of the british, the embarkation, to prevent any property being carried away which by the treaty is stipulated to be left. It is not probable that our Army will disband till the embarkation takes place. The Army are like to be furnished with three months pay at the time of disbanding. Part of it must be a paper anticipation. Mr Morris will continue in office until the engagements necessary to be entered into for that purpose shall be discharged. The troops of the southern Army composing the Pennsylvania, Maryland & Virginia Lines are sent for to be brought into their respective States, in order to their being discharged. Congress are now busyed in reducing as fast as may be the publick expenditures, & setling the necessary peace arrangements. A plan of revenue for funding the publick debt, which has taken up much time in Congress, will be immediately forwarded for the consideration of the States, accompanied with the documents necessary to give information relating to that important subject.(2) As was natural to expect at the close of so long a war, we find a considerable debt on our hands, which, all will agree, it much concerns our national Character & prosperity to provide for, how various so ever may be the opinions as to the mode of doing it. It is, I think, Sir, also of much importance at this time that the accounts of the several States with the United States should be liquidated & brought to an equitable adjustment. Unless this is done it will be impossible to preserve mutual confidence & a good understanding among them, or to obviate the objections which almost every one in its turn makes against complying with the requisitions necessary for the common interest & safety. Commissioners for liquidating those accounts are now gone & going into the States. The necessary instructions to the one nominated for Connecticut, I understand by Mr Morris, are sent forward, & hope, if he is approved by the State, he will be able immediately to proceed to business.(3) We are not yet, Sir, favoured with the definitive treaty of peace, which is now daily expected. The completion of it is supposed to have been somewhat delayed to consult the approbation of the Emperor of Germany & the Emperess of Russia, who particularly interested themselves in the restoration of a general peace. By the enclosed paper your Excellency will perceive that another change has taken place in the british ministry. Not seeming in a humour to be satisfied, that fickle nation one day sacrifices a premier MAY 13, 1783  for continuing the war, & the next day another for putting an end to it. The truth perhaps is, that Great Britain, not having been able to accomplish her purposes either by figting or treating, finds it more convenient to charge the failure on a dificiency in her servants, than to acknowledge, what the world perceives to be the case, a deficiency in her resources & power. It is no secret that her debt is so increased as to require, together with her peace establishment, a million & a half annually more than her revenue amounts to. This circumstance alone made it necessary for her at all events to purchase peace--and will probably be a sufficient security for her good behaviour for a long while yet to come. Neither the safety of this country, or the ballance & peace of Europe requires that Great Britain should be at all more reduced than she in fact is. And it is by avoiding that distraction of counsels & corruption of manner which have brought her down that America can hope to rise; or long enjoy the blessings of a revolution which under the auspices of Heaven she has gloriously compleated.  I am informed by Colo. Dyer that he expects Judge Huntington will soon come forward to Congress to releive him. I have to request, Sir, that some Gentleman of the Delegation may also soon come forward to releive me. I expect to be under the necessity of returning in the month of June at farthest. I have the honor to be, Sir, with great respect & consideration, Your Excellency's most obedt, humbl Servt. Oliver Ellsworth. ""

  Dear Sir Philada. May 13. 1783. {Marbois lately took occasion in our family (1) to complain of ungenerous proceedings of the British against individuals as well as against their enemies at large and}(2) finally signified that {he was no stranger to the letter transmitted to Congress which he roundly avered to be spurious. His information came from Boston} where the {incident is said to be no secret} but {whether it be the echo of letters from Philadelphia or has transpired from the correspondence of Mr. Adams to his private friends is} uncertain.(3) This {conversation passed during my absence in New Jersey but was related to me by Mr. Carrol. MAY 13, 1783  A project for a treaty of commerce with Britain has been reported by Secretary foreign affairs and is now in the hands of a committee.(4) The objects most at heart are first a direct trade between this country & the West Indies. Second a right of carrying between the later and other parts of the British empire. Thirdly a right of carrying from West Indies to all other parts of the world. As the price of these} advantages, {it is proposed that we shall admit British subjects to equal privileges with our own citizens. As to the 1st object it may be observed that the bill lately brought in British parliament renders it probable that it may be obtained without such a cession.} As to the {second that it concerns eastern states} cheifly and {as to the third that it concerns them alone.} Whilst the {privilege to be ceded} will cheifly if not alone {affect the southern states.} The interest of these {seems to require that they should retain at least the faculty of giveing any} encouragement {to their own merchants ships or mariners which may be necessary to prevent relapse under scotch monopoly or to} acquire {a maritime importance.} The {eastern states need no such precaution.} Genl. Washington & Genl. Carlton have had an interview on the subject of arrangements for executing the provisional Treaty. It was interrupted by the sudden indisposition of the latter. In the conversation which took place he professed intentions of evacuating New York & all the posts in the U.S. held by British Garrisons as soon as possible, but did not authorize any determinate or speedy expectations. He confessed that a number of Negroes had gone off with the Refugees since the arrival of the Treaty, and undertook to justify the permission by a palpable & scandalous misconstruction of the Treaty, and by the necessity of adhering to the proclamations under the faith of which the Negroes had eloped into their service. He said that if the Treaty should be otherwise explained, compensation would be made to the owners and to make this the more easy, a register had been & would be kept of all Negroes leaving N.Y. before the surrender of it by the British Garrison. This information has been referred by Congs. to a Committee.(5) But the progress already made in the discharge of the prisoners, the only convenient pledge by which fair dealing on the other side could be enforced, makes it probable that no remedy will be applied to the evil. I have sent Mr. Randolph a pamphlet comprehending all the papers which are to be laid before the States relative to the National debt &c. and have desired him to let you have the reading it.(6) The fewness of the copies made it impossible for me to get one for each of you.

  Dear Sir Philada. 13. May. 1783. By Mr. Lee who set out yesterday afternoon I sent you a pamphlet collecting into one view all the acts & documents relative to the National debt &c, which Congress have prepared for the Legislatures.(1) For still more minute information on the subject, I refer you to Mr. Jones who is now on his way to Virga. and will be at Richmond a few days after Mr. Lee. I refer you to him rather than to the latter gentleman because the task will coincide more with his sentiments as to the measure. Genl. Washington & Genl. Carlton have had an interview on the subject of the provisional treaty which was interrupted by the indisposition of the latter. It wd. seem from the conversation which passed that altho' a sincere intention is professed of evacuating N.Y. & all the other posts, the time at which it may be expected is very uncertain; and that a shameful evasion of the article for restoring the slaves will be practiced. Carlton did not deny that numbers of them were going off from N.Y. and attempted to justify the indulgence by a most outrageous misconstruction of the Treaty; and by the [professed?] necessity of adhering to the tenor of the proclamations under which the Negroes had resorted within the British lines. He said that in case a different construction of the Treaty sd. be established a compensation would be made to the suffering owners, and that the precaution of keeping Registers of all Negroes which should leave N.Y. would be accordingly observed. An ominous sample of candor & good faith in our New friends! We have no further advices of the definitive Treaty. The sweets of peace begin to be amply enjoyed notwithstanding its delay. All foreign commodities have fallen to a price, almost below example, whilst the produce of the Country has proportionally risen beyond former prices. Salt is already down at 1/4 Dr. per bushel & wheat up at 8/. per do. I hope a removal of all legal obstacles to a share of these blessings,  MAY 13, 1783  will claim the first attention of the Assembly. Their proceedings on that & other matters will furnish you with ample means I trust for resuming your correspondence as soon as your forensic labours will admit of a respite. With great affection I am Dr. Sir Yr. fr[i]end & Sert.  J. Madison Jr. [P.S.] The letter from the Govr. signifies that the territorial cession of Virga. has been revoked. Is this the fact?

  Sir Philadelphia 13th May 1783 General Washington & Sir Guy Carleton had a meeting on the 5th instant; the interview was short, owing to Sir Guy being taken ill. The following is an extract of what passed between them.(1) With respect to the Evacuation of New York, Sir Guy Carleton informed the General that every preparation which his Situation & circumstances wou'd permit was making. That an additional Number of transports, & which were expected, were necessary to remove the Troops & Stores. And as it was impossible to ascertain the time when the Transports wou'd arrive, their passages depending on the Casualties of the Sea, he was therefore unable to fix a determinate period within which the British forces wou'd be withdrawn from the City of New York. But that it was his desire to exceed even our own wishes in this respect & that he was using every means in his power to effect with all possible dispatch an Evacuation of that & every other post within the United States occupied by the British Troops under his direction. That he Considered as included in the preparations for the final departure of the Troops, the previously sendg. away those persons, who supposed that, from the part they had taken in the present War, it wou'd be most eligible for them to leave the Country, and that upwards of 6,000 persons of this Character had embarked & sailed--and that in this embarkation a number of Negroes were comprised. Genl Washington thereupon expressed his surprized, that after what appeared to him an express stipulation to the contrary in the treaty, Negroes the property of the Inhabitants of these States shou'd be sent off. To which Sir Guy Carleton replied, that he wished to be considered as giving no construction of the Treaty--That by property in the treaty might only be in- MAY 13, 1783  tended property at the Time--the Negroes were sent off. That there was a difference in the mode of Expression in the treaty--Archives, papers &c were to be restored--Negroes & other property were only not to be destroyed or carried away. But he principally insisted that he concieved it cou'd not have been the intention of the british Government by the Treaty of peace, to reduce themselves to the Necessity of violating their faith to the Negroes who came into the british Lines under the proclamation of his predecessors in command. That he forbore to express his Sentiments on the propriety of those proclamations, but that delivering up the Negroes to their former Masters wou'd be delivering them up, some possibly to Execution, and others to severe punishments, which in his opinion wou'd be a dishonorable violation of the public Faith pledged to the Negroes in the proclamations. That if sending off the Negroes shou'd hereafter be declared an infraction of the treaty, Compensation must be made by the Crown of G. Britain to the owners. That he had taken Measures to provide for this by directing a Register to be kept of all Negroes who were sent off, specifying the Name, Age & Occupation of the person, & the Name & place of residence of his former Master.

May 13th, 1783 I have been looking with some degree of Impatiance for the Arrival of Mr. Foster, have had no information respecting his coming sence yours of 31st March, except one from Mr. Gilman of the 29th April, Wherein he mentions that Mr Foster had been in town a few days before, and that it was uncertain when he would set out. I am very sorry the state is unrepresented, like to be for some time, it is not likely that Mr. Foster will get here before I set out for home.(1) I have business of Importance to transact in the Massachusetts State, which if neglected will cause me much trouble, if that was not the case I would have overlooked other inconveniences, and have tarried until the State had opertunity to send one in my room. MAY 14,1783  If I have no money from the State before I set out, I know not at present how to get home, but am in hopes I can borrow. The Deligates from the State of Massachusetts have Instructions to bring on the Affair of the old money to see if Congress will do Justice to the Possessors,(2) and as far as I can learn, if Congress refuse to do it, the State will take it in, & do themselves Justice, by Stopages. Inclosed are an Address,(3) Newspaper &c. I am Sir with sincere Regard your Honours Humle. Servant, P White ""

  Sir Philadelphia, May 14, 1783 The President of Congress will of course have transmitted to Your Excellency the plan lately adopted by Congress for funding the public debt.(1) This plan was framed to accommodate it to the objections of some of the states; but this spirit of accomodation will only serve to render it less efficient, without making it more palatable. The opposition of the state of Rhode Island for instance is chiefly founded upon these two considerations. The Merchants are opposed to any revenue from Trade, and the state depending almost wholly on commerce wants to have credit for the amount of the duties. Persuaded that the plan now proposed will have little more chance of success than a better one; and that, if agreed to by all the states, it will in a great measure fail in the execution, it received my negative. My principal objections were: 1st That it does not designate the funds (except the impost) on which the whole interest is to arise; and by which (selecting the capital articles if visible property) the collection would have been easy, the fund productive and necessarily increasing with the increase of the Country. 2dly. That the duration of the fund is not coextensive with the debt but limited to twenty five years, though there is a moral certainty that in that period, the principal will not by the present provision be fairly extinguished. 3dly That the nomination and appointment of the collectors of the revenue are to reside in each state; instead of at least the nomination MAY 14, 1783  being in the United States, the consequence of which will be, that those states which have little interest in the fund by having a small share of the public debt due to their own citizens will take care to appoint such persons as are least likely to collect the revenue. The evils resulting from these defects will be that in many instances the objects of the revenues will be improperly chosen and will consist of a multitude of little articles which will on experiment prove insufficient--that for want of a vigorous collection in each state, the revenue will be unproductive in many and will fall chiefly upon those states which are governed by most liberal priniples; that for want of an adequate security, the evidences of the public debt will not be transferrable for anything like their value--that this not admitting an incorporation of the Creditors in the nature of banks will deprive the public of the benefit of an increased circulation, and of course will disable the people from paying the taxes for want of a sufficient medium. I shall be happy to be mistaken in my apprehensions but the experiment must determine. I hope our state will consent to the plan proposed; because it is her interest at all events to promote the payment of the public debt on Continental funds (independent of the general considerations of Union & propriety). I am much mistaken if the debts due from the United States to the citizens of the state of New York do not considerably exceed its proportion of the necessary funds, of course it has an immediate interest that there should be a Continental provision for them. But there are superior motives that ought to operate in every state, the obligations of national faith honor and reputation. Individuals have been already too long sacrificed to public convenience. It will be shocking and indeed an eternal reproach to this country, if we begin the peaceable enjoyment of our independence by a violation of all the principles of honesty & true policy. It is worthy of remark that at least four fifths of the domestic debt are due to the citizens of the states from Pensylvania inclusively Northward. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most Obed ser, AH P.S. It is particularly interesting that the state should have a representation here. Not only many matters are depending which require a full representation in Congress and there is now a thin one; but those matters are of a nature so particularly interesting to our state, that we ought not to be without a voice in them. I wish two other Gentlemen of the delegation(2) may appear as soon as possible, for it would be very injurious to me to remain much longer here. Having no future view in public life, I owe it to myself without delay to enter upon the care of my private concerns in earnest.(3) ""

  Dear sir, Philadelphia, May 14th, 1783 I have receiv'd the letter you did me the Honor to write the 18th ultimo; it was deliver'd me by Mr. Appleton, who is still here with Mr. Wendel, & you may be assured of my attention to them, & more particularly so as they are recommended by you. It never once entered my thoughts to be displeas'd with you for the reasons you are pleas'd to mention, but the true reason for my not doing myself the Honor of addressing you before, was, that I concluded when I undertook to attend Congress last, that I would correspond but little, on account of my health, & exercise more; yet I freely acknowledge my neglect in not noticing you by letter before. You are pleas'd to congratulate me, \""on the happy conclusion of the War,\"" & please to accept in return the like salute & what adds to this agreeable event is that we have obtained all that cou'd reasonably be expected; such has been the conduct of our negociators, that, I think, they deserve the thanks of the public, & must ever be respected by this people; no person has a higher sense of instructions than I have, yet I can conceive, that circumstances may so alter affairs that they may & ought to be departed from for the good of their constituents; there is no danger here at present, whatever there may have been heretofore, of their conduct being disapproved, but the contrary; I conclude you are not unacquainted with the difficulties they have had to encounter, and when this comes to be known, & many other secret matters of State hereafter, I agree with you that it will have all the effects you are pleas'd to mention. It is difficult to tell what will be the \""Issue of the fifth Article,\""(1) but you may expect a full compliance, so far as respects Congress, & then I expect the states will act with freedom, as they think proper. I wish to stand well in the opinion of Dr. Lee, as I assure you he does in mine; and I have it in request from him to make you his best respects when I write. By my correspondents, I understand that the late resolutions of Congress respecting the officers of the army are not likely to be agreeable to our state; It should be remembered that some years since, Congress engaged them half pay for life, not to make good their depretiation, as I understand some people say; And by our late reso- MAY 14, 1783  lutions we have only made a commutation with them,(2) and had not this been done, I have reason to think, that we should have been requested to have paid our own officers, & many others would, most likely, have receiv'd there pay out of the public treasy. & it wou'd have been difficult for us hereafter to have got the matter adjusted & settled. The late important resolutions of Congress respecting our finances, I do myself the Honor to inclose,(3) but as they will speak for themselves, I shall make no observations upon them, further than assuring you that they were come into after the greatest deliberations; & so was the resolutions respecting the officers of the army.

  Sir Phila. May 20th 1783. I ought before this time to have written to you & given some short account of the state of politics in Congress, having promised you at my departure from Boston that I would do it--but want of leisure, though it may appear strange, & not of inclination has hitherto prevented. By the last post I sent you under cover to Mr. E. Parsons (1) Our System of Finance, you will there see the product of four months labour, & be able to judge of the Views & the wisdom of Congress. In some of my Letters to Mr. Parsons, Mr. Cabot & Mr. Jackson &c,(2) I have mixed politics & business, & made some observations on the propriety & tendency of that System. The political parts of those Letters I desired them to communicate to you, if They have done so, you are acquainted in some degree with my sentiments as to that plan. The impost I always was opposed to, & being now confirmed in my opinion, as to the danger of too great an influence resulting from it to individuals, already too influential by far, I am now as much or more opposed to it than ever! It is the avowed intention of some to create a Congressional influence by the disposal of places of honor & of proffit, but the effect of this plan if adopted will be a very great increase of particular individual (3) influence & not Congressional. Congress may appear to appoint but it will be, of such persons only as may be nominated by others. Some late instances will show you what extensive influence some Gentlemen have--& many I dare say wonder that after what has passed Mr. Morris should remain in Office. It is however not an easy matter to set him aside. His Friends in Congress are many & powerful. His continuance in Office is by others deemed absolutely necessary at present. It is supposed, & perhaps justly, that if any other person was to be appointed to his Office, or if the business was at- MAY 20, 1783  tempted by a Board, he would be able so to obstruct & oppose their measures that no success could be expected. I confess that I am much of that opinion myself, I should wish however to run the risk, persuaded that the difficulty will not lessen but increase. He will always have it in his power to embarrass if displaced & the disposition is not to be doubted. Disappointed Views in ambitious minds will certainly produce resentment. To increase such influences, such ability to injure the public in an individual, is in my mind very injudicious. The Impost would very greatly increase his power, for all Officers will be appointed by him in effect, which may be necessary to collect it. Let this weight be added to his Scale & the balance will be decidedly in his favour. I also think, that a general impost would afford a revenue less secure, & be more unequal in its operation, than any other mode that has ever been suggested--for the reasons on which I ground this opinion, I must refer you to the Letters to Mr. Cabot &c, which I trust you have seen. The arrival of Peace was to us very opportune, Our finances were low, Our resources small, Our affairs deranged & Our dependance on foreigners increasing very much--by means of this fortunate Event We are liberated from very dishonorable restraints, & have an opportunity of retrieving our character & putting Our Affairs into a good train. Foreign Loans & the officious advice of distant Friends, is no longer necessary for us. We have nothing but the Debt to provide for at present, & that surely is not so large, as that we can not pay the interest with ease & punctuality, in the way of Quotas agreable to the Constitution. When We were pressed hard with very heavy Taxes to carry on the war, when Our all was nearly taken to raise, feed & cloath Our Army, when Our means of acquiring was destroyed by the Enemies Cruizers, it is true that under these circumstances, Quotas were not nor could they be paid--but no man I think can with propriety say, that the interest of the Debt can not be provided for by the rule of the Confederation, untill fair trial has been made. If Quotas are assigned, the States may provide by Excises or in any other way such Funds as are necessary, & they ought to make the provision adequate & permanent, but the collection should be made by the States & the amount go to their respective credit. I should not think it eligible by any means to adopt the Impost or any other general Taxes, untill by experience it shall be found, that no other mode will answer. To attempt to strengthen the federal government by influence, must be at all times dangerous & will certainly introduce great corruption, but to do it at present & in the way proposed, will be peculiarly improper, for the force of Congress will not be thereby increased but lessned. It will greatly increase an influence which is now by much too great, & enable a few individuals to give law to Congress .  We are employed in making peace establishments, preparing Treaties of Commerce &c, but We are so divided in Sentiment that the work goes on very slowly. There are those who appear to be sorry that peace has taken place, or rather perhaps, that the terms are so good & we thereby rendered so independent of all foreign powers. These persons seize every occasion to find fault with it, to censure Our Commissioners, & to retard the complying with the Articles of the Treaty. There are those also among us who wish to keep up a large force, to have large garrisons, to increase the navy, to have a large diplomatic Corps, to give large Sallaries to all Our Servants. Their professed view is to strengthen the hands of government, to make us respectable in Europe, & I believe, they might add to divide among Themselves & their Friends, every place of honour & of proffit--but it is easy to see where all this will lead us, & Congress I think is not yet prepared for such Systems. It is thought by many to be highly necessary that Congress should send forth their recommendations agreable to the fifth Article.(4) The States will consider it I suppose as matter of form, & such appears to have been the Ideas of Our own & the British Commissioners--but the States ought seriously to set about measures for complying with the other Articles--good faith & sound policy both require it. If it be delayed by the Massachusetts We shall certainly lose many good Subjects & give the British great advantages by peopling Nova Scotia for them. We can not forward their interest more than by taking measures to prevent the return of the greater part of the Refugees. No evil surely can arise from the admission of many of them--a judicious line should be drawn, excluding all such as have been active against us, but the greater part have never been very inimical nor very much disposed to be active in their Service. If We exclude all those of Our own State they will be received by some of the other States, or go to Nova Scotia, & when they have set down in Business & formed their connexions, We never shall again recover Them. I see by the Boston papers that great pains is taken to prevent their return, by inflaming the minds of the people against them, & it is suggested that it will be highly ungrateful & will give great uneasiness to Our Allies. This argument is I suspect furnished by those very Allies, for certain it is, that they were the cause of Our being saddled with the Refugee Articles. Their object was to divide & perplex us by it, having done this, they on the same principles now endeavour to encourage our opposition to it, & if they can by this means prevent or delay a friendly, commercial intercourse between us & Brittain, They gain a great point. The same measures are used by Them here & in Congress. They expect in this way to retain their influence over us, & prevent any connexion with others--but surely the good Sense of this people will guard Them against the intrigues of Foreigners, & will direct Them to pursue   Their true interests. No possible advantage can arise to us by engaging in a separate dispute with Brittain, on the contrary great injury may result therefrom. It [will] delay Our forming a beneficial commercial Treaty with Them. If such a Treaty was pushed immediately, while they feel anxious about Our Trade & are disposed to make large concessions to secure it, We might gain very important points--but if by engaging in disputes with them it should be delayed, experience will shew Them that Our trade will necessarily fall to Them, individuals here will eagerly drive a Trade with them, & they will see that important concessions on Their part will not be necessary. Our policy should be to perfect the Treaty of peace & to comply with the several Articles on Our part, at least in appearance, that no objection may arise to Their engaging with us readily in the treaty of Commerce. These are my own Sentiments on this subject & they correspond with those of Congress. I mention them freely to you because I think the interest of Massachusets is deeply concerned. Congress are now framing a commercial Treaty & preparing recommendations to the States to take measures for perfecting the Treaty of Peace. I hope no impressions will be made to prevent a candid attention to the Subject. The Commutation given to the Officers for their half pay I find is disagreable to many in the Massachusetts. The Governor has wrote or the Council, I do not recollect which, for the yeas & nays on that question, they will find that We were unanimous (5)--& if their design is to punish those who voted for it, by dropping Them, They must have an entire new delegation. For my own part I am very willing that such should be Their intention, for I am quite tired of public Life & wish to quit it for ever--& I will thank you to inform the Gentlemen of both Houses, that I can not think of serving another year, should they be disposed again to elect me. But a cool deliberate attention to the matter will, I think, result in an entire acquiesence on Their parts to the measure. The promise of half pay was made at a time when the Army was new arranged, by which many a great number of super numerary Officers were set aside---that arrangement was necessary for disciplining the Army & a great saving resulted from it--but such was the temper of the Officers, that it would have been hazardous to have attempted the reform, without some such provision as the half pay. The General urged the necessity of the reformation, & at the same time stated that it would endanger the dissolution of the Army, if it was not made to be the interest of the Officers to remain in the Service--The particular situation of Our Affairs at this time was such, that had the Army been broke up, it must have been fatal to Our Cause. The promise of half pay appears then to have been a necessary measure at least it appears that the General & Congress thought it so--the promise was made & was absolute--Congress was therefore bound to take measures for securing the half   pay, or to commute & provide for the interest on the amount of the commutation. The latter was thought most eligible both for the Officers & the public--the interest on the capital of the commutation is just 3/5ths of one years half pay, the public are therefore saved 2/5ths annually by the commutation, which is an object of importance for us at present, the other provisions to be made for other Debts, being as large as we can with convenience make in Our present situation--a few years will enable us by the sale of back Lands & other increasing resources gradually to pay off the principal. It will be found by calculation that five years whole pay is not quite equal to half pay for Life, the Officers therefore do not by the commutation receive a full equivalent. Mr. Osgood who was on the Comittee for settling the value of the half pay has all the calculations with him & can give full information on this head. I inclose you copies of the Generals Letters (6) which induced the resolutions of May 1778 & Octr. 1780 establishing the half pay for Life. May 21. Having missed the opportunity by which I expected to have forwarded this Letter, I have time to be more particular with respect to the Refugees. It seems to be the opinion of Congress & I confess it is my own opinion, that the whole of the fifth Article, except the last clause,(7) is to be considered as merely recomendatory, & the States may decide as they please upon it. A question may arise whether it would not be good policy to comply with some other parts--but the last clause I take to be absolute & obligatory. It is not to be understood that the persons mentioned in the last clause, are such as come within the descriptions mentioned in the former parts of that Article. They must be such therefore as it would be very unjust to deprive of their claims upon confiscated Estates. It would be absurd to suppose that a man who had forfeited his own Estate should be entitled to recover a Debt due to him from another forfeited Estate. The same principles which justify the takeing from him the former will surely justify his being deprived of the latter. But it may be a question whether those who by the sixth Article(8) will save Their Estates, not being already confiscated, will not also be entitled by the last clause of the fifth Article, to their just demands on Estates that have been confiscated, for such demands are certainly a part of Their property or Estate. The sixth Article appears to be explicit & absolute. This Article will occasion the most difficulty I imagine--it is very much opposed to the feelings & interest of the people & will probably meet great opposition in some of the States--it should however be considered, that the interest which may by that Article be restored to individuals, bears no proportion to that which may be lost by not complying with it. The giving up those Estates is the only concession We have made in the Treaty, it is the only price We have paid for the many great points conceded to us. When the French saw that   Brittain had acceded to terms, vastly more beneficial to us than They had any Idea of, or They wished us to obtain--They then endeavoured to prevent the completion of the Treaty & by their intrigues urged on Brittain to insist on very large provisions for the Refugees. Lengthy discussions & warm debates between Our Commissioners & the British ensued. Monsr. Vergennes interested himself very much in the discussion, & finally obliged Our ministers to accede to the Refugee Articles as they now stand, but not till long after every other point was settled. Their policy in doing this was, in the first instance, to break off the Treaty & deprive us of those concessions, which they wished us not to obtain--in this They failed. The same policy now leads them to encourage an opposition to the Treaty here, to bring on a dispute between us & Brittain, & if they can, to create such dissension as shall retard if not prevent a compliance with the Articles. The Articles relative to the Refugees, they find somewhat obnoxious to us, as they expected, & They will use every means in their power, to strengthen and encourage an opposition to Them. It is their interest to do this, I therefore do not blame Them for it, but I think We shall be highly blameable, if We suffer them to mislead us. We must expect much intriguing & many attempts to inflame & mislead us, but a cool steady attention to Our interest, to their interest, to the tendency of the measures they propose & the channels through which they are communicated, will enable us to guard against Them. Nay we may even turn their own weapons against themselves, as Our Commissioners did in Europe. But there is another important question as to the Refugees, it is whether they or any of them shall again be admitted as Citizens. To increase the number of good Subjects certainly is desireable & must be for Our interest, but it may be doubted whether any of that Class ever can make good Subjects. In order to form a right judgment on this question it will be necessary to attend to their characters &c. Many of them have conducted in such a manner, both before & since the evacuation of Boston, their opposition to us has been so uniform & active, their minds are so sound & become so rancorous, that their admission can not be in any degree prudent--the just resentment of the people against such characters, would not suffer them to reside among us, & their malice is so great, so deep rooted, that they would be dangerous to us. Their are others & by far I suppose the greater part of those who went away, that never were greatly opposed to us in principle, who have never taken an active part against us, who very soon wished again to return & live among us, whose feelings have in the main been with us, who were persuaded to go away by their friends, whose fears hurried them off, when there immediate interest led them to depart from us with an intention of soon returning, or who by a variety of acci  dents & circumstances, were induced to leave us, with feelings & dispositions far from being inimical. Many of these We know have been long desirous of returning & it is said that all of them wish to do it. The neglect, the insults, & the various kinds of distress which these people have experienced since they took refuge with the British, & chiefly brought on Them by the British, has very thoroughly weaned them from their attachment, & created an aversion to every thing that is British. No impression unfavorable to us, compared with others, can remain in their minds. They must prefer Our interest & living with us to that of any other people. Their desire to return is evidence of such a disposition--for it must arise from their preferring us & Our interest, or because they wish to reside with us in order the more effectually to injure. The latter is by no means presumable, since they must know, that their former character & past conduct, will naturally lead us to be very watchful over Them, which would render it almost impossible for them to attempt any thing injurious to us without being detected, & certain destruction must be the consequence of being detected. Their having such a strong desire to live among us must I think evidence a good disposition toward us. They will be desirous of effacing every impression & all remembrance of their past conduct--this & the recollection that their Conduct in future will be very narrowly watched, must certainly induce them to the most exemplary behaviour. If increasing the number of good Subjects is desirable & We have good evidence that any part of the Refugees will become such, should it not be Our policy to receive Them? Can We not draw a line that may admit the return of such as will again be good Subjects, & exclude all those that will be dangerous to us or that we are doubtful of? We know well every character among them, why then may We not say that A, B & C. shall not be permitted to return, naming Them, but that all others shall on certain conditions be again received? It may not perhaps be improper nor unjust to require of Them such Sums, as will be equal to double the amount of the Taxes paid, by persons of equal property during the war--whether it would not be best to delay the taking any decided explicit measures for this purpose, in order that the passions of people may subside, & their feelings which would lead to an opposition have time to abate &c, deserves attention--but if it is thought best to receive Them at any future day, no step should be taken that can make them dispair of being admitted, for with such an impression They will probably settle in Nova Scotia, or in some of Our sister states--& having fixed themselves down, in either, they will soon form such connexions, as will make it difficult for them to remove, though you should then even invite them to return. By permitting them to return on some such conditions as I have suggested, We may avail Ourselves of a great part of Their property, not already con-  fiscated, We shall increase the number of Our Subjects, We shall deprive the British of their property & labours, & We shall perhaps take a good step to defeat the Views of the French. On the other hand if we prohibit their return, the sixth Article if complied with will deprive us of the whole of their property, the British will probably have the benefit both of their labours & Estates, & the French will have the greater means of creating uneasiness & distrust between us & Brittain. I have taken the liberty of throwing out these scattered thoughts on the Subject, and I flatter myself that if they should not coincide with yours, you will consider them as proceeding from an honest disposition to promote the public interest. I wish I had time to copy this Letter, to write it fairer & to methodize in some degree my Ideas--your candor will apologize for me I know as I have not time. With respect I am Dr Sir you most humle Servt. S. Higginson Sir May 22. The report on the old money has been several times called up, but the disposition of Congress is clearly not to decide upon the matter at present (9)--nor will they come to any Question as to the former requistions & supplies. Every thing of the kind is opposed & by some means or other set aside. Many motions have been made since I have been here to bring forward Questions of that kind & have failed. The rules of Congress make it easy to get rid of disagreable motions. There are so many States that are delinquent, such a variety of Sentiments as to what is right or eligible, that I very much doubt whether any of those Questions will be ever settled. They seem to be afraid of promoting dissensions & uneasiness among the States by deciding on such Subjects, but I think much more danger will arise from a delay of such decissions. It has been Our intention to push them to some decission as to the old money, but no good opening has presented since the business of finance has been finished, & while that was on the Table they would not attend to any other matter. We can not muster nine States above one day in a Week, there being but just nine States in Town. The Financier has given permission to Mr. Hillegas to receive the April & May money remaining in Our Treasury. Mr. Osgood has got with him the State of all the different emissions & can give you every information respecting the several situations of the States as to money matters.

  Tuesday May 20. [1783] On the proposal to discharge the the troops who had been enlisted for the war (amounting to ten thousand men) from the want of means to support of them. Mr. Carroll urged the expediency of caution, the possibility that advantage might be taken by G. B. of a discharge both of prisoners and of the army, and suggested the middle course of furloughing the troops.(1) Mr. Dyer was strenuous for getting rid of expence; considered the war at an end; that G. B. might as well renew the war after the definitive Treaty as now; that not a moment ought to be lost in disburdening the public of needless expence. Mr. Rutlidge viewed the conduct of G. B. in so serious a light that he almost regretted having voted for a discharge of the Prisoners. He urged the expediency of caution, and of consulting the Commander [in] chief. He accordingly moved that the Report he referred to him for his opinion & advice. The motion was seconded by Mr. Izard. Mr Clarke asked whether any military operation was on foot that the Commander in Chief was to be consulted. This was a national question, which the National Council ought to decide. He was agst. furloughing the men because they would carry their arms with them.(2) He said we were at peace, & complained that some could not separate the idea of a Briton from that of cutting throats. Mr. Ellsworth enlarged on the impropriety of submitting to the Commander in Chief a point on which he could not possess competent materials for deciding. We ought to discharge the men engaged for the war or to furlough them. He preferred the former. Mr. Mercer descanted on the insidiousness of G. B. and warmly opposd the idea of laying ourselves at the mercy of G. B., that we might save fifty thousand dollars; altho' Congress knew that they were violating the Treaty as to Negroes. MAY 20, 1783  Mr. Williamson proposed that the soldiers be furloughed. Mr. Carroll seconded him, that the two modes of furlough & discharge might both lye on the table. By general consent this took place.(3) The Report as to confiscated property, on the Instructions from Virga. & Penna. was taken up, & agreed to be recommitted,(4) together with a motion of Mr. Madison to provide for the case of Canadian refugees, & for settlement of accts. with the British, and a motion of Mr. Hamilton to insert, in a definitive Treaty, a mutual stipulation not to keep a naval force on the Lakes.(5) ""

  Dear Sir Philada. May 20. 1783. In obedience to your request I am to answer by this post your favor of the 7 inst.(1) recd yesterday. My brevity will therefore be excused. For the tenor of the conditions on which Congs. were formerly willing to accept the cession of Virga. I beg leave to refer to their resolutions of the 6 of Sepr. & 10 of Ocr. 1780.(2) I take it for granted you have their Journals. The expunging of the article relative to State expences was a subject of no less regret with me than it is with you & for the same reason, but I acknowledge that considering the probable defect of vouchers in Virga. & the ardor with which the clause was supported from some other quarters, mine was much diminished in the course of the discussion.(3) On the last trial there were but two or three states besides Virga. that favored it. S. Carolina's opposition to it had great weight.(4) After this clause was expunged it was thought improper to retain the connective clause as Virga. will now be at liberty to confine her accession to the revenue part of the plan, without enlarging her territorial Cession or being deprived of the opportunity of annexing any Conditions she may think fit. The connective clause however could not have been carried I believe either before or after the mutilation of the plan. Notwithstanding this disappointment I adhere to my wishes not only that the revenue may be established, but that the federal rule of dividing the burdens may be changed, and the territo MAY 20, 1783  rial disputes accomodated. The more I revolve the latter subject, the less inducement I can discover to a pertinacity on the part of Virga. and the more interesting it appears to the Union. I am sorry your departure from Richmond became necessary before more of the members were assembled. I make no doubt that useful impressions have been left with those who were so & were susceptible of them. I shall keep in mind the intimation relative to Mr. Short. The idea of adding the fraction of a year to my Congressional service is totally new,(5) and even if it sd. prevail, will not as far as I can now see, coincide with my private conveniency. Since my last I have been able to procure for you a copy of pamphlet which I herewith enclose.(6) If in consequence of the provisional steps I before took it sd. prove a duplicate I shall thank you to forward one of them to my father. The ladies & gentlemen join me in complimts. to Miss Patsy & to your self. Adieu J. ""

  My dear Sir Philada. May [20](1) 1783. Your favor of the 9th inst.(2) was duly brought by yesterday's Mail. My impatience is great to know the reception given to the propositions of Congress, by the Assembly.(3) I foresaw some of the topics which are employed against them, & I dread their effect from the eloquent mouths which will probably enforce them; but I do not despair. Unless those who oppose the plan, can substitute some other equally consistent with public justice & honor, and more conformable to the doctrines of the Confederation, all those who love justice and aim at the  MAY 20, 1783  public good will be ad[v]ocates for the plan. The greatest danger is to be apprehended from the difficulty of making the latter class sensible of the impracticability or incompetency of any plan short of the one recommended; the arguments necessary for that purpose being drawn from a general survey of the fderal system, and not from the interior polity of the States singly. The letter from the Delegation by the last post to the Govr. appri[sed] the legislature thro' him that negociations for a Treaty of Commerce with G. B. might be expected soon to take place and that if any instructions should be deemed proper no time ought to be lost in giving the subject a legislative discussion. For my own part I wish sincerely that the commercial interests of Virginia were thoroughly investigated & the final sense of the State expressed to its representatives in Congress.(4) The power of forming Treaties of Commerce with foreign nations is among the most delicate with which Congs. are intrusted, and ought to be exercised with all possible circumspection. Whilst an influence might be expected from them on the event or duration of the war, the public interest required that they should be courted with all the respectable nations of Europe, and that nice calculations of their tendency should be dismissed. The attainment of the object of the war has happily reversed our situation and we ought no longer to enslave ourselves to the policy of the moment. The State of this Country in relation to the Countries of Europe, it ought to be observed, will be continually changing, and regulations adapted to its commercial & general interests at present, may hereafter be directly opposed to them. The general policy of America is at present pointed at the encouragement of Agriculture, and the importation of the objects of consumption. The wider therefore our ports be opened and the more extensive the privileges of all competitors in our Commerce, the more likely we shall be to buy at cheap & sell at profitable rat[es.] But in proportion as our lands become settled, and spare hands for manufactures & navigation, multiply, it may become our policy to favor those objects by peculiar privileges, bestowed on our own Citizens; or at least to introduce regulations inconsistent with foreign engagements suited to the pesent state of things. The relative situation of the different States in this respect is another motive to circumspection. The variance of their policy & interests in the article of commerce strikes the first view, and it may with great truth be noted that as far as any concessions may be stipulated in favor of foreign nations they will cheifly be at the expence of those States which will share least in the compensations obtained for them. If for example, restrictions be laid on the Legislative right of the States to prohibit, to regulate or to tax as they please their imports & exports, & to give such preferences as they please to the persons or  vessels employed in them, it is evident that such restrictions will be most felt by those States which have the greatest interest in exports & imports. If on the other side the Citizens of the U.S. should in return for such a stipulation be allowed to navigate & carry, in forbidden channels, is it not equally evident [that] the benefit must fall to the share of those States which export & consume least, and abound most in resources of ships & seamen. Nor should it be overlooked that as uniform regulations of the Commerce of the different States, will so differently affect their <<different> several interests, such regulations must be a strong temptation to measures in the aggrieved States which may first involve the whole confederacy in controversies with foreign nations, and then in contests with one another. I may safely suggest also to your ear, that a variety of circumstances make it proper to recollect that permanent engagements entered into by the Confederacy with foreign powers, may survive the Confederacy itself, that a question must then arise how far such engagements formed by the States in their federal character, are binding on each of them separately, and that they may become pretexts for quarrels with particular States, very inconvenient for the latter, or for a general intrusion into American disputes. On the other hand candor suggests that foreign connections, if founded on principles equally corresponding with the policy & interests of the several States might be a new bond to the federal compact. Upon these considerations I think it would be advisable to form all our commercial Treaties in future with great deliberation, to limit their duration to moderate periods, & to restrain our Ministers from acceding finally to them till they shall have previously transmitted them in the terms adjusted, for the revision & express sanction of Congress. In a Treaty of Commerce with G. B. it may be the policy of Virga. in particular to reserve her right as unfettered as possible over her own commerce. The monopoly which formerly tyrannized over it, has left wounds which are not yet healed, & the numerous debts due from the people, & which by the provisional articles they are immediately liable for, may possibly be made instruments for reestablishing their dependence. It cannot therefore be for the interest of the State to preclude it from any regulations which experience may recommend for its thorough emancipation. It is possible that experience may never recommend an exercise of this right, nor do my own sentiments favor in general, any restrictions or preferences in matters of commerce, but those who succced us will have an equal claim to judge for themselves and will have further lights to direct their judgments. Nor ought the example of old & intelligent nations to be too far or too hastily condemned by an infant & inexperienced one. That of G. B. is in the science of commerce particularly worthy of our attention; And did she not originally redeem the management of her Commerce   from the monopoly of the Hanse towns by peculiar exemptions to her own subjects? did she not dispossess the Dutch by a like policy? and does she not still make a preference of her own Vessels & her own mariners the basis of her maritime power? If Holland has followed a different system the reason is plain. Her object is not to exclude rivals from her own navigation, but to insinuate herself into that of other nations. The leading objects in the proposed Treaty with G. B. are 1. a direct commerce with the W. Indies, 2. the carrying trade between the different parts of her dominions, 3. a like trade between these & other parts of the world. In return for these objects we have nothing to offer of which we could well deprive her, but to <<please> secure to her subjects an entire equality of privileges with our own Citizens. With regard to the 1. object it may be observed, that both the temper & the interest of the nation leave us little ground to apprehend an exclusion from it. The French have so much the advantage of them from the facility of raising food as well as the other produce of their Islands, that the English will be under the necessity of admitting supplies from the U.S. into their Islands, and they surely will prefer paying for them in commodities to paying for them in cash. With regard to the 2 & 3 objects, it may be observed that altho' they present great advantages, they present them only to those states which abound in maritime resources. Lastly with regard to the concession to be made on the part of the U.S. [it] may be observed that it will affect cheifly, if not solely, those States which will share least in the advantages purchased by it. So striking indeed does this contrast appear that it may with certainty be inferred that If G. B. were negociating a Treaty with the former States, only, she would reject a mutual communication of the privileges of natives, nor is it clear that her apprehensions on this side, will not yet lead her to reject such a stipulation with the whole. If this subject should be taken up by the Legislature, I hope that altho' not a member, your attention & aid will be given to it. If it sh. not be taken up publickly, I wish for your own private sentiments & those of the most intelligent members which you may be able to collect. We have no European intelligence. Sr. G. Carlton in a letter to Gel. W. avows the same sentiments as were expressed in the conference relative [to the] Negroes, but repeats his caution agst. their being understood as the national [constr]uction of the Treaty.(5) I send you herewith three more copies of the pamphlet of Congress which I have procured since my last.6 If Majr. Moore & Mr. F. Strother sd. be in the Assembly, I beg the favor of you to present one with my compliments to each of them. The third you will dispose of as you may think best.

I most Sincerely wish Connecticut & every other State to be represented; I wish the New England States to be represented; I wish they had not Suffered for want of a full representation. When I Consented to attend Congress the last time I understood it to be the mind of the Assembly that 3 should attend from that State in so Critical a season, but that has been the Case but for a little time in the Course of the Year. It is unhappy to have a State divided, which sometimes must be the Case when but two, or yield & Condescend the one to the other. It is very inconvenient that a Member cannot be absent, whatever the Occasion may be, but it leaves the State unrepresented. I have been urged, I have tarried, I have never heretofore left the State Unrepresented, tho it has frequently been done, & I believe to good satisfaction; but I begin to be Apprehensive that as long as I tarry no Gentn will come forward, for I believe no one is fond of being here, am therefore determined by the leave of Providence to set out on my return in a very few days.(1) I think I cannot be blaimed, I hope & trust I shall be excused, & as I expect to be at Hartford before the Assembly rises, renders it unnecessary for me to enlarge in this letter, and nothing New of Importance to Communicate.

  Friday May 23 [1783] The Report from Mr. Hamilton, Mr. Gorham and Mr. Peters, in favor of discharging the soldiers enlisted for the war; was supported on the ground that it was called for by Economy and justified by the degree of certainty that the war would not be renewed. Those who voted for furloughing the soldiers, wished to avoid expence, and at the same time to be not wholly unprepared for the contingent failure of a definitive treaty of peace. The view of the subject taken by those who were opposed both to discharging and furloughing, were explained in a Motion by Mr. Mercer seconded by Mr. Izard to assign as reasons, first that Sr. Guy Carlton had not given satisfactory reasons for continuing at N. York, second, that he has broken the articles of the provisional Treaty relative to the negroes, by sending them off.(1) This motion appeared exceptionable to several, particularly to Mr. Hamilton, & rather than it should be entered on the Journal by yeas & nays, it was agreed that the whole subject should lye over.(2) The Report relating to the Department of For.

Should all the other States unite heartily in the plan, I do not think any single State will take upon itself the odium & the consequences of persevering in a veto upon it. I wish much to know how far your hope was well founded of an introduction of Mr. Jefferson into the Legislature. The hopes of some I find extend to his Mission to Congress.

Lest it should have happened otherwise, we will endeavor to provide one for the next mail.(2) The propositions of Congress with regard to Revenue have long since been transmitted to your Excellency by the President. Relying on the full explanations of our two Colleagues who will attend the General Assembly, we have supposed it unnecessary to trouble you with any less perfect remarks on that subject in our correspondence. The state of our information from Europe remains precisely as at the date of our last; the progress of the definitive Treaty, of the British bill relative to a commerce with the United States, and of the arrangements for a new administration, being left in the utmost uncertainty by the latest arrivals in this part. Congress have received no further communications from the Commander in chief, with respect to the Conduct of the British Commander at New York, touching the evacuation of that port, or the execution of the other articles of the provisional Treaty. The breach of that which stipulated a restoration of the Negroes, will be made the subject of a pointed remonstrance from our Ministers in Europe to the British Court; with a demand of reparation;(3) and in the mean time General Washington is to insist on a more faithful observance of that stipulation at N.

  Dear Sir Philadelphia 27th May 1783 In Consequence of our Conversation the other Evening, I give you in Writing my Thoughts on what was the Subject of it. An Adventure in Lands, particularly in those near the frontier Settlements and the navigable Rivers of Pennsylvania and New York, might, I think, be very advantageous to those concerned in it, if conducted on proper Principles and in a proper Manner. I will tell you, without Reserve, the Terms, on which I would undertake the Management and Direction of the Business. I must have a fourth Part of the Lands. The Capital appropriated for the Purchases ought to be £100,000 Sterling. It must not be under £60,000 Sterling. The whole must be deposited in Philadelphia; or be, in some other Way, at my Order, before I make any Engagements for Lands. The Money advanced for my fourth Part must be payable in seven Years: No Interest to be paid for the three first Years: An Interest of 5 per Cent per an. to be paid for the four last Years. I would not wish more than three Persons to be joined with me in the Adventure; because a Partnership composed of a great Number is often, for that Reason, inconvenient. However, as my Share and Interest is not to be affected by a greater Number than three, I do not propose that Number as a Condition. These Terms being complied with, I will examine the Titles, make the Purchases, superintend the Conveyances, direct what shall be necessary to be done with the Lands belonging to the Company, and make Sales where I shall think it adviseable or advantageous to sell. I will keep, in regular Books, an Account of my Transactions with and for the Company: To the Inspection of any Member these Books shall be open: And any Member may have a Copy of them; provided he pay me the Expence of having it made for him. I will reserve no Purchases for my own Benefit, without the Consent of the Company: But such Engagements as I have already made, and such as I may make before the proposed Company shall be established, and its Establishment MAY 17, 1783  communicated to me, must be excepted, as is reasonable, from this Stipulation. The Term of the Partnership ought to be seven Years; and, at the Expiration of it, the Lands not sold should be divided. Perhaps it may be thought, that the Interest for three Years of at least £15,000 Sterling is a great Consideration: But it should be remembered, that the Trust is great; that the Care and Trouble will be very considerable; and that I lay myself under a Restraint, which precludes me from other Advantages. I must have a Clerk for writing the Deeds and Transactions of the Company, and keeping their Accounts. To their Business I must make some Part of my Practice in the Law subservient: This, you know, is no small Sacrifice. If a Partnership shall be formed on the Terms and Principles I have mentioned; I hereby empower and authorise you to accede to it for me and in my Name. I do this, because, if the company is formed, it is of great Importance that it be formed soon, and that I be enabled soon to begin the Purchases. No Time should be lost in sending over the Articles of the Partnership, and placing the Money so as to be at my Order.1 I am, with much Regard, dear Sir, sincerely yours, James Wilson ""

  Dear Sir Philadelphia 30th. May 1783. By Mr. Beresford (1) I was favoured with your Letter of 15th instant; & he at the same time delivered me 320 Dollars from you. Your drafts in favour of Walker, & Reedle amount to no more than 260 Dollars; so that I am at a loss to know why you have [in the language of the Chief Magistrate of a very respectable State](2) superadded Sixty Dollars: I shall however keep them, & be ready to pay them to your order. My House, you say, is in a very ruinous condition. And this, in spite of my Lares; those beautiful & elegant plaster-headed household Gods, who could have been posted on the outward Wall, for no other purpose, but that of affording protection. I hope it will not be inconsistent with the plan to be formed by you, and Dr. Drayton, to have them dismissed, the old bricks rubbed from the top of the House, to the bottom, & the interstices new pointed. My intention is to have a Piazza in each Front, & an Area sunk; to give light to the Offices under the House. I have written to London for a Carpenter, & Builder. If I am so fortunate as to get such a one as McKenzie, or Bernard Elliott had, he will be very serviceable, & save me a great deal of expence. I am sorry to learn that so many of your Negroes are still missing; & the more so, as I fear that it will not be an easy matter to recover them. Sr. Guy Carleton has very explicitly given it as his opinion that the Negroes within the British Lines can not be claimed by virtue of the Preliminary Treaty, as property belonging to the Citizens of the United States, because they have been declared free by Proclamations, issued by Officers acting under the authority of the King of Great Britain. This is a most impudent evasion of the Treaty; & yet we are not in a condition to help ourselves. The conduct of the States respecting Revenue, has so totally annihilated all Continental Strength, & credit, that no Enemy need be afraid of insulting us. If the most Southern States do not in the course of a few years exhibit some melancholy proofs of the truth of this observation, I shall be greatly mistaken. The Delegates from those States which are most immediately interested in Carleton's affected misconstruction of the Article in the Treaty, respecting the Negroes, have attempted everything in their power to obtain redress. A majority of Congress were afraid to make an express declaration that the British had violated it. It was said that a renewal of hostilities might be the consequence of such declaration, & the case of General Burgoyne was adduced as a proof of the danger of declaring a Treaty broken. It is most certain that without money, and without credit we are by no means in a condition to continue the War: but bad as the British Ministry are, I can hardly think it MAY 30, 1783  possible that they should have the effrontery to support Carleton in the measure I have mentioned. Besides, it is very well known that though we are not at our ease, they can not be said to be on a bed of Roses: Peace was almost as desirable an event to them, as to us. We therefore urged the necessity that Congress should signify their disapprobation of Carleton's conduct, & would not consent that the Army should be furloughed, till our proposition, (which I now enclose)(3) was complied with. I thank you for your congratulations on the arrival of my family, but am sorry to inform you that it is a mistake. My last Letter from my Wife is dated at Paris the 10th of April. The four youngest Children had just recovered from the Measles. They were to set out for Bourdeaux on the 22d of that Month, & expected to sail from thence for Philadelphia, about the 10th of this.

  Sir, Philadelphia 31st May 1783. I do myself the honor to inclose to your Excellency a copy of an Act of the Legislature of New York for granting certain privileges to Congress, provided they fix upon the Borough of Kingston, for their place of residence.(1) A copy of the Act of the Corporation of Kingston, whereby the Trustees of the Freeholders offer Congress a mile square of Land, and relinquish to Congress their jurisdiction in the said Borough, has been sent to Wilmington, in order to stimulate the owners of the hill, (who have all of their property in the Borough) if not to give, at least to sell, on reasonable terms. These acts have been referred to a Committee, and a Report has been made, \""That if the Borough of Kingston will grant 3 miles Square, and the Legislature of New york will enlarge their priviledges and grant them jurisdiction of Criminal Matters, it may be expedient to Accept of the offer.\"" Since this Report was made advice has been received of a generous offer made by Maryland. That State offers the jurisdiction of the City of Annapolis, and ten miles round it--The use of the State House, the Governor's House, and several other public buildings, and to give Thirty thousand pounds in Specie, towards erecting other buildings for the use of Congress, or the Delagates. Delaware cannot offer so much--but, if the owners of the Hill above Wilmington will agree to it, a better situation, attended with many more advantages can be offered, and an extensive Charter of priviledges granted. As it is a matter of consequence, which, once past can never be recalled, I hope it will not be neglected. Vessels from different Ports are frequently coming in, but there is yet no advice of the definitive Treaty being concluded. A new arrangement of the Ministry of England has been made. The Duke of Portland at the head of the Treasury, and Lord North & Charles Fox joint Secretaries of State. This City is full of Goods, and the Merchants in a Continual bustle. Several English Houses are opened, and Goods of all kinds are falling daily. I have the Honor to be, Sir, your Excellency's most obt. and very hble Servant, E. McComb ""

  May [1783] I find at Boston the Letters are playing off the Refugee Article against the Commissioners.(1) Thus, the French will let no man maintain his ground who stands in their way. It is however a Game I expected they would play, and yet it is the more wicked and unpardonable when we know that Vergennes caused the Insertion of that Article himself, and did it too for the purpose of embarrassing us.(2) That this was the motive cannot be doubted, from the use that is now made of it by his Emissaries in this Country. Would not the Annunciation of this fact guard the public from any further Imposition? Could any Evil arise from its being known at this time? Or do you think it too soon yet to set fire to the Train? It certainly is wrong to suffer ourselves to be thrown into this Confusion by the Intrigues of Foreigners, without making one Effort to expose them.

  May [1783] It is time that Massachusetts changed her Policy as to Refugees. Several of the States will receive any and every Body, and it will at last be found to be the Dictates of sound Policy and a regard to our own Interest to admit all who are not remarkably rancourous and active against us. But in the mean time the minds of the people should be prepared for such a measure by judicious publications on the subject.(1) I have mentioned to You the large Peace Establishment, the formation of a Navy, and other favorite projects of the Financier and his Followers and Adherents. But these Propositions ought to be rejected by  MAY, 1783  Congress, and I think they will, tho' they will be back'd by that Influence which I have already described as being far too great. A thorough Understanding betwixt Morris, Livingston, the French Minister, the Spanish Agent, and some of the wealthier Citizens of this place, forms a Phalanx that attacks with great force, and when their whole Efforts are brought to a point, and their numerous Dependents are brought forth to action, they are almost irresistible. It is their practice to hunt down every man that can't be brought over to their Views, and so many Engines are set at work to depress every individual Opposer, that a man must have more than a common Share of good fortune to escape them, so that an Independent Spirit here is in a constant State of Warfare. I find it difficult to be well with these people, and at the same time act honestly; but as I am not easily discomposed I am determined they shall finally respect me in spite of themselves. Congress have set too long in a City where every man affects the Politician, and having no System of his own, his Zeal is made subservient to the Designs of others, without his perceiving it. They must remove to some Spot where they will have a better Chance to act independently.(2) ""

  Sir, Philadelphia, June 1st 1783 In my last letter(1) to Your Excellency I took occasion to mention that it was of great importance to the state, at this time to have a representation here as points in which by its present situation it is particularly interested are dayly and will be dayly agitated. It is also of importance at this moment to the United States (not only from general considerations but) because we have a very thin representation in Congress and are frequently unable to transact any of those matters which require nine states. I wish your Excellency would urge a couple of gentlemen to come on, as it becomes highly inconvenient to me to remain here and as I have staid the full time to be expected.(2) I observe with great regret the intemperate proceedings among the people in different parts of the state in violation of a treaty the faithful observance of which so deeply interests the United States. Surely the state of New York with its capital and its frontier posts (on which its JUNE 1, 1783  important fur-trade depends) in the hands of the British troops ought to take care that nothing is done to furnish a pretext on the other side, even for delaying much less for refusing the execution of the treaty. We may imagine that the situation of Great Britain puts her under a necessity at all events of fulfilling her engagements and cultivating the good will of this country. This is no doubt her true policy; but when we feel that passion makes us depart from the dictates of reason, when we have seen that passion has had so much influence in the conduct of the British councils in the whole course of the war--when we recollect that those who govern them are men like ourselves and alike subject to passions & resentments--when we reflect also that all the great men in England are not United in the liberal scheme of policy with respect to this Country and that in the anarchy which prevails, there is no knowing to whom the reins of government may be committed, when we recollect how little in a condition we are to enforce a compliance with our claims--we ought certainly to be cautious in what manner we act, especially when we in particular have so much at stake, and should not openly provoke a breach of faith on the other side, by setting the example. An important distinction is not sufficiently attended to--the 5th article is recommendatory--the sixth positive. There is no option on the part of the particular states as to any future confiscations, prosecutions or injuries of any kind to person, liberty or property on account of any thing done in the war. It is matter of discretion in the states whether they will comply with the recommendations contained in the 5th article; but no part of the 6th can be departed from by them without a direct breach of public faith and of the confederation. The power of making treaties is exclusively lodged in Congress. That power includes whatever is essential to the termination of the war and to the preservation of the general safety. Indemnity to individuals in similar cases is an usual stipulation in treaties of peace, of which many precedents are to be produced. Should it be said that the associations of the people, without legal authority do not amount to breath [breach] of the public faith? The answer is if the government does not repress them and prevent them having effect, it is as much a breach, as a formal refusal to comply on its part. In the eye of a foreign nation, if our engagements are broken, it is of no moment whether it is for the want of good intention in the government or for want of power to restrain its subjects. Suppose a violence committed by an American vessel on the vessel of another nation upon the high seas and after complaint made, there is no redress given--is not that a hostility against the injured nation which will justify reprisals? But if I am not misinformed there are violations going on in form of law. I am told that indictments continue to be brought  under the former confiscation laws; a palpable infraction if true of the 6th article of the treaty to which an immediate stop ought no doubt to be put. It has been said by some men that the operation of this treaty is suspended 'till the definitive treaty--a plain subterfuge. Whatever is clearly expressed in the provisional or preliminary treaty is as binding from the moment it is made as the definitive treaty which in fact only developes, explains and fixes more precisely what may have been too generally expressed in the former. Suppose the British should now send away not only the negroes but all other property and all the public records in their possession belonging to us on the pretence above stated, should we not justly accuse them with breaking faith? Is this not already done in the case of the negroes, who have been carried away, though founded upon a very different principle a doubful construction of the treaty, not a denial of its immediate operation? In fine is it our interest to advance this doctrine and to countenance the position that nothing is binding 'till the definitive treaty, when there are examples of years intervening between the preliminary & definitive treaties? Sir Guy Carelton in his correspondence has appeared to consider the treaty as immediately obligatory and it has been the policy which I have persued to promote the same idea. I am not indeed apprehensive of a renewal of the war, for peace is necessary to Great Britain; I think it also most probable her disposition to conciliate this country will outweigh the resentments which a breach of our engagements is calculated to inspire. But with a treaty which has exceeded the hopes of the most sanguine which in the articles of boundary & the fisheries is even better than we asked, circumstanced too as this Country is with respect to the means of making war, I think it the height of imprudence to run any risk. Great Britain without recommencing hostilities may evade parts of the treaty. She may keep possession of the frontier posts, she may obstruct the free enjoyment of the fisheries--she may be indisposed to such extensive concessions in matters of commerce as it is our interest to aim at; in all this she would find no opposition from any foreign power; and we are not in a condition to oblige her to any thing. If we imagine that France, obviously embarrassed herself in her Finances would renew the war to oblige Great Britain to the restoration of our frontier posts, or to a compliance with the stipulations respecting the fisheries (especially after a manifest breach of the treaty on our part) we speculate much at random. Observations might be made on the last article which would prove that it is not the policy of France to support our interests there. Are we prepared, for the mere gratification of our resentments to put those great national objects to the hazard--to leave our western frontier in a state of insecurity--to relinquish the fur trade and to abridge our pretensions to the fisheries? Do we think na-  tional character so light a thing as to be willing to sacrifice the public faith to individual animosity? Let the case be fairly stated: Great Britain and America two independent nations at war--The former in possession of considerable posts and districts of territory belonging to the latter--and also of the means of obstructing certain commercial advantages in which it is deeply interested. It is not uncommon in treaties of peace for the uti possidetis to take place. Great Britain however in the present instance stipulates to restore all our posts & territories in her possession. She even adds an extent not within our original claims more than a compensation for a small part ceded in another quarter. She agrees to readmit us to a participation in the fisheries. What equivalent do we give for this? Congress are to recommend the restoration of property to those who have adhered to her, and expressly engage that no future injury shall be done them in person, liberty or property. This is the sole condition on our part where there is not an immediate reciprocity (the recovery of debts and liberation of prisoners being mutual, the former indeed only declaring what the rights of private faith which all civilized nations hold sacred would have dictated without it) and stands as the single equivalent for all the restitutions and concessions to be made by Great Britain. Will it be honest in us to violate this condition or will it be prudent to put it in competition with all the important matters to be performed on the other side? Will foreign nations be willing to undertake any thing with us or for us, when they find that the nature of our governments will allow no dependence to be placed upon our engagements? I have omitted saying any thing of the impolicy of inducing by our severity a great number of useful citizens, whose situations do not make them a proper object of resentment to abandon the country to form settlements that will hereafter become our rivals animated with a hatred to us which will descend to their posterity. Nothing however can be more unwise than to contribute as we are doing to people the shores and wilderness of Nova-scotia, a colony which by its position will become a competitor with us among other things in that branch of commerce on which our navigation and navy will essentially depend. I mean the fisheries, in which I have no doubt the state of New York will hereafter have a considerable share. To your Excellency I freely deliver my sentiments because I am persuaded you cannot be a stranger to the force of these considerations. I fear not even to hazard them to the justice and good sense of those whom I have the honor to represent. I esteem it my duty to do it because the question is important to the interests of the state in its relation to the United States.  Those who consult only their passions might choose to construe what I say as too favourable to a set of men who have been the enemies of the public liberty; but those for whose esteem I am most concerned will acquit me of any personal considerations and will perceive that I only urge the cause of national honor, safety and advantage. We have assumed an independent station; we ought to feel and to act in a manner consistent with the dignity of that station. I anxiously wish to see every prudent measure taken to prevent those combinations which will certainly disgrace us, if they do not involve us in other calamities. Whatever distinctions are judged necessary to be made in the cases of those persons who have been in opposition to the common cause, let them be made by legal authority on a fair construction of the treaty, consistent with national faith and national honor. I have the honor to be with perfect respect, Yr. Excellency's Most Obed servant [P.S.] Your Excellency will have been informed that Congress have instructed General Washington to garrison the frontier posts when surrendered with the three years Continental troops.(3) This is more for the interest of the state than to have them garrisoned at its particular expence--and I should wish that permanent provision might be made on the same principle. I wait to see whether any Continental peace establishment for garrisons &c. will take place before I engage the consent of Congress to a separate provision. I cannot forbear adding a word on the subject of money. The only reliance we now have for redeeming a large anticipation on the public credit already made and making for the benefit of the army is on the taxes coming in. The collection hitherto is out of all proportion to the demand--it is of vast consequence at this juncture that every thing possible should be done to forward it. I forbear entering into details which would be very striking upon this subject. I will only say that unless there is a serious exertion in the states public credit must ere long receive another shock very disagreeable in its consequences. &c. ""

  Dr Sir Phila. June 3. 1783. Your Letter respecting the Resolution of the general Court(1) I received a long time since, & you may perhaps think it very strange that I have not before made any reply. Soon after the receipt of that Letter we heard that you intended coming hither in company with Mr. Lowell in April, this was confirmed by Mr. Lowell when he wrote to me to get lodgings for him, & I expected fully to have seen you here by the first of May. When he arrived he informed me that you intended setting off soon after him, I therefore still continued to expect you & supposed that a Letter if forwarded would not meet you at home--nor had I then any Idea that you waited to hear what Congress had done or would do as to that Resolution. Your Letter to me implied that the doings of Congress or the opinions of the Delegates might affect your decission as to taking a Seat in Congress but I really believed from those Accounts that I had misconstrued it or that you had altered your mind. When I received your Letter I communicated it to Our Colleagues & we agreed to remonstrate, but Congress were then & for some time after very busily employed in matters of importance, as Finance &c, & would not attend to any other Business. We therefore thought it best to delay the matter a Little. In the mean time I conversed with such of the members now in Congress as were then here, they are only four.(2) Their Ideas were so very different on the Subject from Ours that we thought there was no chance of doing or obtaining any thing that would be agreable to you or useful to the JUNE 3, 1783  State. The new members thought that the present Congress could not with decency or propriety decide upon the Conduct of a former House. The changes of members, the alterations of the Ru[les] & the Length of time with many other circumstances which Mr. Osgood has no doubt stated to you, We found would prevent Our doing any thing to effect & determined us to make no attempt. Of this determination I should have given you notice but for the reasons before mentioned, as soon as we found it. Be assured it was not inattention or a want of disposition to satisfy you in this matter that prevented my writing you before. Mr. Osgoods Letter recd. yesterday proposes the attempting to lodge the papers with a Remonstrance on the files, this may be done if you wish it, but I doubt whether it will be permitted.(3) Congress really esteem you & wish you to be here, but I suspect they will think it very improper at this distance of time to take any notice of the matter, & to fail in the attempt will give you uneasiness. We shall however be governed by your inclination & Judgement on the Subject. With real respect I am Sir your most huml Serv S. Higginson ""

  My dear friend Philada. June 3d. 1783. I thank you cordially for the narrative of legislative proceedings contained in your favor of the 24th ulto.(1) In return for the Journal of the House of Delegates I inclose herewith a copy of the proceedings of Congs. since Novr. last. There is a chasm in the Journal you have sent arising from the miscarriage of your letter which ought to have come by the preceding mail. The idea of protracting my service in Congs. into a part of the ensuing year does not coincide with the plans which I have in view after Novr. next.(2) I had rather therefore not stand in the way of another Gentleman whom it might suit better, and whose attendance would be  JUNE 4, 1783  more certain. If a reduction of the number of Delegates should take place it will be still more essential not to include me. I have recd. from Mr. Webb £100 refd. to in yours. The remittance of £1000 havg. been shared not equally as heretofore but according to our respective arrears, this sum will somewhat overpay me. You will therefore not apply for other warrants in my behalf. I wish you had reserved the £50 which you advanced for me sometime ago & that you wd. now draw on me for it if it be more convenient for you to receive it here, or you can readily sell a bill where you are. It will be perfectly convenient for me to pay it.(3) Being somewhat indisposed in my head & also pressed for time I beg leave to refer to Mr. Jones instead of repeating what I have written to him.(4) Adieu My dear sir & be assured that I am yr. sincere friend, J.

  Sir, Philadelphia, June 4th, 1783. Colo Dyer has so lately left Congress & will fully inform of the State of affairs to that time, as leaves me very little to acquaint your Excellency with. A Packet just arrived at New York from Falmouth, it is reported, brings information that the definitive treaty was signed, & that the british are to leave this coast at farthest by the 1st of Augt. The Packet also brings a list of the new british ministry established the 2d of April, which I take the liberty to inclose.(1) From the strange coalition of which it is formed, there is little reason to doubt but that another change, of a partial nature, will follow as soon as the present convulsed state of that nation shall have subsided. Lord North, who is the fixed favorite of his Sovereign & a man of the most System, business & address, will easily find means to lay aside Mr Fox & his coadjutors when he can well do without them, as he has already done with regard to one set of opponents whom he let come forward to perish in the odium of executing measures which himself had rendered necessary. A letter from Mr Dumas to the Secretary of Forreign Affairs, advises that Mr Vanbercle, Ambassador from their High-Mightinesses the States General to these United [States] was to sail for America the 1st of this month.(2) A question which has been more than once agitated in Congress on the expediency of an interchange of ministers with forreign courts, except on special occasions, is yet undecided & probably will receive no direct decision. While, on the one hand, respectability abroad, facility of acquiring & of communicating useful information, & the long established custom of all European nations, except the uncivilized Turk & the mountain barricaded Swiss, plead strongly in the affirmative, Considerations of OEconomy & simplicity of manners, so necessary to be observed in republicks, & factious intrigues, so necessary for them to avoid, have much weight in the opposite scale. JUNE 4, 1783  Congress have appointed Oliver Pollock, Esqr, late agent of these United States at New Orleans, their agent to reside at the Havannah(3)--it is to be hoped we shall not ultimately fail of the valuable Trade to that island, tho' its ports are at present shut against us, owing, it is said, in some measure to abuses committed there under the American Flagg by foreigners who wished to render it obnoxious. We hear from the Assembly of Virginia that the House of Delegates, notwithstanding they so unanimously & recently voted a repeal of their Act granting to the United States the Impost first recommended by Congress, had given liberty for a bill to be brought in for complying with the requisition of the Impost as it now stands, & that there was a great probability the Act would pass. This is the only Assembly from which we have yet heard upon that subject, & from which, next to that of Rhod Island, the greatest opposition was apprehended. A very liberal offer is made by Maryland to induce Congress to fix its residence at Annapolis. One less so had before been made by the State of New York of the Town of Kingstown. Which, or whether either of them, will be accepted is uncertain; tho' it is generally agreed that Congress should remove to a place of less expence, less avocation & less influence than are to be expected in a commercial & opulent city.(4) I hope, Sir, Mr Huntington, who has long been expected & is at present much needed in Congress, will soon be here;(5) & that with him or very soon after, some other Gentleman of the Delegation will also come forward, that I may be at liberty soon to return home, which it will be necessary for me to do. I have the honor to be, with great respect, Sir, your Excellency's most obedt, Huml Servt. Oliver Ellsworth. ""

  Dear Sir(1) Philadelphia June 4. 1783. You have undoubtedly before this seen the resolutions of Congress relative to impost &c. in which the States are requested to cede their vacant lands to congress to establish a fund so far as they will go toward the extinsion of the publick debt, it is certainly best it should be done, but it behoves Massachusetts to be very carefull in their grant if they see fit to make any or other way, then may be in danger of giving land to New York instead of giving it to the general stock--but I think no danger will arise if it is made in the same form as the cession of NYork which may be found in the Journal of Congress. March 1781--page 48. We are daily in expectation of the definitive treaty and if it arrives soon I am in hopes Congress will adjourn for three or four months which I think will answer good purposes. This place is exceedingly expensive and will undoubtedly encrease in that way--as foreign ministers increas. The Dutch minister has wrote to Mr Livingston desiring him to hire for use the best house in Town--& to buy him the most elegant carriage & six of the best carriage horses that can be bought--& if the dutchman rides with six horses the ministers of France England &c. will not chuse to ride with less. New York & Maryland have made offers of Towns for the use of Congress--you will see them as they are to be sent to the States,(2) in order that may all be represented, when the question is considered on the first monday of October next. I am in hopes I shall be at home before your Session ends and in the interim I remain Your friend & very humble Sert, Nath Gorham ""

The proceedings of the Corporation of the City of Annapolis have been transmitted to Wilmington, in hopes that with so good an example before JUNE 4, 1783  their eyes, the inhabitants of that Borough, especially the owners of the Land in question, will enable the Legislature to make a generous offer to Congress.

  Dear Sir, Wednesday June 4 1783. I am extremely sorry to find the public must be deprived of the benefits of your experience & services at the very time when I apprehend they will be most wanted. I am the more mortified, as I am persuaded from Your letter to a late committee appointed to confer with you as well as from some expressions of Mr Hamilton that you would have continued in the Office had your salary been only made equal to your necessary expenses. I wish experience may not prove this to have been an ill timed parsimony. Who your successor will be I cannot divine. Wednesday next you see is assigned for the election but no person is yet nominated. I rejoice in the honorable testimonial Congress have given of your ability, zeal and fidelity. I wish the next who fills the office may give as much satisfaction and be equally deserving; but the choice must then fall on a different person from some within my view who I believe would wish to succeed you. By the resolution which precedes the vote of thanks you see I am directed to receive into my care the papers of your Office till a successor can be appointed.(1) I wished to have avoided this and that the papers should have been left in the custody of your first under secretary or that they should be delivered over to a committee of Congress. The first I apprehended would have been most proper if it is really in- JUNE 5, 1783  tended to elect a successor at the time mentioned and the latter, if that is not the case. However as the resolve only directs me to receive the papers into my care, and as I am determined to have nothing to do with the business of the Office, I must beg the favour of you to order all the papers to be packed up and Sealed with your seal and then sent to my office where they shall lie till Congress otherwise dispose of them.

June 10th 1783 In my last(1) I mentioned the Ideas of Congress as to half pay, the Refugee Articles, & Finances--since then Congress have been considering those Articles again, when a diversity of Sentiments appeared as to the fifth Article. Some consider it as wholly recomendatory, others think that clause which says that \""persons of every other description June 10, 1783  should have free liberty &c\"", & the last clause, are absolute & obligatory. Seven States were not then in favour of passing any resolution respecting those Articles, & no recomendations will probably be made by Congress to the States till the definitive Treaty arrives. In the mean time the States will not I hope proceed in the confiscation of refugee Estates in opposition to the sixth Article, nor take any measures that may hereafter be Barrs to the admission of certain descriptions of the Refugees. I can not but think that some of them may be admitted not only with safety but with advantage to the States--it surely then must be good policy to do that which will be beneficial in an interested View to Ourselves, & which will greatly conciliate & perhaps excuse a departure in some other point from the Treaty. We can in such cases with a good grace comply with the Treaty without any danger. Should the sixth Article not be complied with, may we not lose all those important advantages secured to us by the Treaty, & will it not reflect great dishonour upon Our Comissioners who have really performed Wonders in obtaining such a Treaty? Will any man say that the Treaty is not a good one & highly honorable to us? Is not Our interest in the most important & essential points compleatly established? Could We reasonably or did the most sanguine man expect that nothing disagreable to Us would be inserted into the Treaty? Could We presume that in a Revolution like this We should have succeeded in every possible point, that no interest, no Views should be attended to but Ours?, surely not. Should the sixth Article be violated by us Brittain may perhaps declare the Treaty void in all its parts. She may tell us that She shall still consider us as a separate independant Nation, but that She will not allow us to fish on the Banks & She will renew her claim to a great extent of Territory ceded to us by the Treaty. Our situation would in such case be very disagreable. We should then be again involved in a War with her without any Ally, any prospect of assistance, or We might tamely give up those two great points--we should then be precisely in the situation which France & Spain wish to see us. Every important Object almost would be lost to the eastern States beyond all hope of recovery. We know that the extent of Territory & the right to the Fishery confirmed to us by Treaty was by no means agreable to France or Spain, Our being an independent Nation satisfies them, the poorer & more confined we are in Our limits & means of growing powerful, the more agreable to them. When We consider the characters that compose the new ministry We may reasonably expect that any opening We may give them to set aside the Treaty will be eagerly embraced. If therefore the Treaty is upon the whole a good one for us & secures to us Our most important interests, We ought to be very careful that we do nothing which can endanger its efficacy or involve us in a new dispute with Brittain. I have no relation, no friend among the Refugees, whose return I am anxious to JUNE 10, 1783  bring about or whose Estate I wish to save from confiscation--I feel no interest operating in my mind but that of the public, this only I am at present anxious about, it is this I wish to secure. I see no object of sufficient importance, to induce us to run any hazard of losing the benefit of the Treaty--the Estates of the refugees surely can not be One. The expence of a small Army for one Season only will infinitely almost overbalance all those that yet remain unconfiscated. We have sent to the Governor, the States of the old money, the April & May emissions & the new emission(2)--by them you will see that a very great proportion of the old money is yet outstanding. They give you all the information required in your Letter of last October. I have no expectation that Congress will come to any resolution as to the old money--many gentlemen think that it would be very improper & dangerous for Congress to do any thing, it ought rather say they to be received from individuals by the State & charged by the State to the Continent, but will they not dispute hereafter that charge as being wholly wrong or because it was called in by the State at an improper rate? Congress should in that case at least determine they will allow the charge & the rate of redemption. Others think that it ought to die in the hands of the posessors; their States are greatly or wholly delinquent & their Citizens have little of it by them, it is natural therefore for them to think thus. We have been prepared ever since I have been here to bring the matter forward, but we have never had an oppy of doing it with success, there has been no period that the States have been all represented or when more than six States could have been expected to vote for the redemption of it at any rate. We have therefore delayed making any motion for a decission in hope that other States might be represented or that something might turn up to favour the motion & give greater prospect of Success--but as the Court is now sitting & it is time they should know the sense of Congress on that Subject, we have determined to push for a decission as soon as nine States are represented--for some time past we have had only eight States. The alteration in the rule proposed by Congress for determining Quotas is I think a good One,(3) it is much more simple & easy to practice upon than the former rule, but the allowance made for the Blacks is much too great--the same number of Souls in the Southern States support themselves, & furnish an excess for exportation by their labour much greater, than the Inhabitants in the northern States can possibly do, & in proportion to that excess is their Ability to pay Taxes. A comparative View of the northern & southern States, their Soil, climates, produce &c will easily account for the difference. It is a common thing for a man in So. Carolina to make from 20 to 30 guineas a head by the labour of his Negroes in a year, & that clear of all expences including their subsistance. I have this information from  southern gentlemen, & it is a matter of great notoriety that their exports produced from their Lands & labour vastly exceeds Ours or any of the northern States. It may however be a question whether it is not best to adopt the [rule?] proposed, since it is certain that the other can never be practised upon & by this Rule we shall stand rather lower than we have heretofore. This proves by the way that we have stood too high by much in all former expenditures. The cession of western Lands by all the States is much to be wished, especially if the Cession was to include all the Lands which are claimed by different States--the extent of the States would then be abundantly great for Jurisdiction, their Laws will never have force nor their governments be effective by and what will then be their limits. Our great Source of contest & uneasiness between the States would then be done away, & a large property would then be vested in the united States for public use, it would go a great way toward extinguishing the public Debt. But the Cession of New York as accepted by Congress is by far too limited, they cede a part only of those Lands which We claim & to which I am informed Our Title is much better than theirs. Mr. Osgood has all the papers relative to those Claims & can give every necessary information to the Court respecting them. New York has also granted to Companies & Individuals very large Tracts within the limits of their Cession, to which Our Claim is as good as to that which they have ceded & much better than theirs. The Cession of Virginia is not yet accepted. Congress do not like it as it now stands, several attempts have been made to croud it through Congress, they have endeavoured to model it so as to hide the exceptionable parts, but no such Cession will be made by Virginia as ought to be satisfactory. This intention of Virginia & New york is clearly to cede that only which they could never expect to hold & to which they have no right, in order to secure to themselves the residues part of which is claimed by other States. They mean in fact to acquire & secure to themselves property by their Cessions, which they might otherwise perhaps have no chance of holding. Massachusetts must therefore be careful making her Cession--it may be best to make a Cession of the same Lands & in the same words with New york, & then bring forward Our Claim to the other Lands yet possessed by N. York. The Cession of N. York as accepted you will find in the Journals March 1, 1781 & the acceptance in Octr. the same year (4) in the Journals. Mr. Livingston has with great reluctance given up the Office of foreign Affairs,(5) the particulars which induced this I will give you my next, the event I think a very agreable One--who will succeed or whether any Successor will soon be appointed is uncertain at present. I wish for one other removal & then I think Congress would be free of dangerous influence & might with much more safety be intrusted with  the power of assessing & collecting moneys in the States, or of imposing & collecting Duties, [but] this I fear is yet at a distance. With respect I am Sir, your most huml. Servt. S. Higginson P.S. Mr. Carter is just setting off that I can not add to nor copy this. The Statements of the emissions of money you can get from the Secretary (6) if they should not be sent to you before this reaches you. ""

  Tuesday June 10. [1783] The Report on the Cession of Virga. was taken up.(1) Mr. Elseworth urged the expediency of deciding immediately on the Cession. Mr. Hamilton joined him, asserting at the same time the right of the U. States. He moved an amendment in favor of private claims. Mr. Clarke was strenuous for the right of the U. S. and agst. waiting longer. (this had reference to the absence of Maryland which had always taken a deep interest in the question). Mr. Gorham supported the policy of acceding to the report. Mr. Fitzimmons recommended a postponement of the question, observing that he had sent a copy of the Report to the Maryland Delegates. The President was for a postponement till the sense of N. Jersey be known. The Delaware Delegates expecting instructions were for postponing till Monday next. It was agreed at length that a final vote should not be taken till that day Mr. M. yielding to the sense of the House, but warning that the opportunity might be lost by the rising of the Legislature of Virga. Mr. Hamilton & Mr. Peters with permission moved for a recommitment of the Report, in order to provide for Crown titles within the territory reserved to the State. Mr. Madison objected to the motion, since an amendment might be prepared during the week & proposed on Monday next. This was acquiesced in. It was agreed that the President might informally notify private Companies & others as well as the Maryland Delegates of the time at which the Report would be taken into consideration. JUNE 10, 1783  The Order of the day for appointing a Secretary of For. Affairs, was called for, & none having been put in nomination, the order was postponed. Mr. Bland then nominated Mr. Arthur Lee, Mr. Gorham, nominated Mr. Jefferson, but being told he would not accept, then named Mr. Tilghman. Mr. Higginson nominated Mr. Jonathan Trumbull. Mr. Mongomery nominated Mr. George Clymer. It was understood that Genl. Schuyler remained in nomination.(2) ""

  My dear Sir Philada. 10 June 1783 Congress have recd. two letters from Mr. {Laurens}(1) dated {London}, one the {fiveteenth of March} the {other fiveth of April}.(2) In the former he {persists in} the {jealousy} expressed in {his letter of} the {thirtieth of December(3) of} the {British Councils. He says} that {Shelburne} had {boasted of his success} in {gaining the provisional treaty without the concurrence of France and of the good effects he expected to draw from that advantage}. Mr. {Ls remark was} that {admitting} the {fact which he did not} altho' it {might disgrace} and even {prove fatal to the American Ministers}, it {could have no such effects on the United States}. His {second letter} expresses more {confidence in the D. of Portland and Mr. Fox}. These {ministers} have withdrawn the subject of commerce with the U. S. from Parliamt. and mean to open negociations for a Treaty with their ministers in Europe. Mr. Fox asked Mr. L. whether these had powers for that purpose: his answer was that he believed so, that he had seen a revocation of Mr. Adams' commission noticed in the Gazettes but that he considered the paragraph as spurious. From this it would seem that {Mr A had never com- JUNE 10, 1783  municated this} diminution of {his powers to his colleagues}. These letters leave us in the suspence in which they found us as to the definitive Treaty. Mr. L. thinks that no such event could have been relied on under Shelburnes administration. He was on the 5th of Apl. setting out for Paris with Mr. David Hartley, successor to Mr. Oswald, from whence he sd. proceed to America unless a definitive Treaty was near being concluded. Notwithstanding the daily arrivals from every quarter we get not a line on the subject from our Ministers at Versailles. Mr. Dumas has inclosed to Congs. sundry papers (4) from which it appears that the {Dutch indulge a} violent animosity {against the French court} for {abandoning their interests and the} liberty of {navigation by a premature concluding of the preliminaries}. Complaints on this head are {made through Dumas to Mr. Adams} with {enquiries whether the American ministers had powers to} concert engagements {with the United Provinces, his M C Majy, and his Cat Majy for maintaining the rights asserted by the neutral confederation} or if the two last {decline with United Provinces alone the answer of Mr A} is not {included but references to it import} that {it was satisfactory and} that {negociations were to be opened accordingly}. It is certain notwithstanding that no {powers equal to such a transaction} were {ever given generally to the ministers} and that as far as they were given they were {superceded by the commission to Mr. Dana}. This correspondence commenced in Jany. & is brought down to late in March and yet no {intimation whatever} concerning it has been {received from the ministers themselves}. Congress have lately sent instructions to the Ministers in Europe to {contend} in {the final treaty for such} amendment of the {article relating to British debts} as will {suspend payment for three years after the war and expressly exclude interest during the war}.(5) Mr. Livingston has taken his final leave of the department of Foreign affairs. He wd. have remained if such an augmentation of his Salary had been made as wd. have secured him agst. future expence. But besides the disinclination of several members to augment salaries, there was no prospect of a competent number of States for an appropriation of money until he must have lost the option of the Chancellorship of N.Y. No successor has been yet nominated, altho' the delay for a choice has passed. I am utterly at a loss to guess on whom the choice will ultimate[ly] fall. {A L} will be {started} if the {defection of a} respectable {competitor} shd. be {likely to force votes upon him}.(6) No such has yet {been made a subject of conversation in my presence}. The general arrangement of the foreign System has been suspended by the thinness of Congs. in part, and partly by the desire of further information from Europe. I fear much the delay will be exceedingly protracted. Nothing but final resignation of the Ministers JUNE 10., 1783  abroad & the arrival of Foreign Ministers here, will effectually stimulate Congs. into activity & decision on the subject. How far & at what time the first cause will operate is precarious. The secd. seems less so. Mr. Van Berkel has sent directions for proper provisions for his reception in the next month.(7) A Sweedish Gentleman recommended by Dr. Franklin as a Philosopher, and by the Ct. de Vergennes as an intended Minister has been here for some time.(8) From the temper of Spain, a mission from that Court also is not improbable. The Treaty of Commerce with G. B. is another business suspended by the same cause. The Assembly have instructed us to reserve to Congs. a revisal after it shall have been settled in Europe.(9) This will give force to the doctrine of caution hitherto maintained by us. The time of my setting out for Virga continues to be uncertain, but cannot now be very distant. The prospect of seeing you, I need not assure you, enters much into the pleasure I promise myself from the visit. Mrs. House & Mrs. Trist char[ge] me with their very sincere & respectful compliments to you & beg that they may be remembered very affectionately to Miss Patsy. I am Dear Sir your sincere friend, J.

  My dear friend Philada. June 10th. 1783 Yesterday's mail brought me two letters from you one of the 15 Ulto.(1) inclosing the intervening sheet of the Journals which ought to have come two weeks ago, the other of the 29th from Williamsbg.(2) inclosing Mrs. Randolphs letter to Mrs. Trist. I have recd. no copy of the Journal from your assistant.(3) Mr. Jones will have informed you that the Mission of Payne to R. Island by Congs. was a fiction of malice. If the trip was not a spontaneous measure of his own, I am a stranger to its origin.(4) I am told by one of the Judges of appeal (5) that no case has yet required from them a construction of the epochs which are to limit captures. The 3d of March was generally applied at first to the American seas, but that opinion has rather lost ground. In N. York it is said that the 3d of Apl. is adhered to.(6) As the like phraseology is said to have been used in former Treaties, the true construction might be found I sd. suppose in Admiralty precedents. We have recd. the instruction relative to Commercial Treaties.(7) The principle on which it is founded corresponds precisely with my idea. But I know not how far the giving an opportunity to the States of exer-cising their judgments on proposed Treaties, will correspond in all cases with the doctrine of the Confederation which provides for secresy in some such cases. The deviation how ever if there be any is trivial, and not being an intended one can have no ill consequences. No progress has been made towards a Treaty with G. B. owing partly to a desire of hearing further from Europe & partly to the paucity of States represented in Congs. It would seem that the plan of regulating the Trade with America by a Parliamentary Act has been exchanged by the present Ministry for an intended Treaty for that purpose. Mr. Laurens was asked by Mr. Fox whether the American Ministers had powers for a commercial Treaty. His answer was that he believed so; that a revocation of Mr. Adam's powers had appeared some time ago in print, but he considered the publication as Spurious. From this it wd. seem that this act of Congs. had never been communicated by the latter to his colleagues. He lately complained of this revocation in a very singular letter to Congs.(8) I consider it as a very fortunate circumstance that this business is still within our controul, especially as the policy of authorizing conditional Treatys only in Europe is so fully espoused by Virga. Mr. Livingston has taken his final leave of the departmt. of F. Affairs. No nomination for a successor has yet been made though the time assigned for the election has passed, nor does the conversation center on any individual. I have forborne on various accts. to hold forth our friend McLurg.(9) I can form no conjecture on whom the choice will ultimately fall. JUNE 10, 1783  The offers of N. Y. & Maryld. of a seat for Congs. are postponed till Ocr. next in order to give time for other offers & for knowing the sense of the States on the subject. Copies of those acts are to be sent to the Executives of each State.(10) I have forgot the request of Mr. Mercer for several weeks to make his apology for failing to open a correspondence with you. The regular one maintained between yourself & me, he supposes, would leave little but repetition to him, and his other correspondents, I suppose give him competent employment. Congress have resumed at length the Cession of Virga. The old obnoxious report was committed, and a new report has been made which I think a fit basis for a compromise. A copy of it is inclosed for the Govr. I have also transcribed it in my letter to Mr. Jones.(11) As it tacitly excludes the pretensions of the Companies, I fear obstacles may arise in Congs. from that quarter. Clarke from N. Jersey informed Congs. that the Delegates from that State being fettered by instructions, must communicate the plan to their constituents. If no other causes of delay should rise the thinness of Congs. at present will prove a material one. I am at some loss for the policy of the Companies in opposing a compromise with Virga. They can never hope for a specific restitution of their claims, they can never even hope for a cession of the Country between the Alleghany & the Ohio by Virga. as little can they hope for an extension of a jurisdiction of Congs. over it by force. I should suppose therefore that it wd. be their truest interest to promote a general cession of the vacant Country to Congress, and in case the titles of which they have been stript sd. be deemed by them reasonable, and Congs. sd. be disposed to make any equitable compensation, Virga. wd. be no more interested in opposing it than other States. I inclose different papers to you & to Mr. Jones, & recommend an interchange. ""

  Tuesday June 17. [1783](1) The day was employed chiefly in considering the Report on the Journal relative to the Department of Finance. Some thought it ought to lie on the files: some that it ought to receive a vote of approbation, and that the Superintendant, should, for the period examined, be acquitted of further responsibility. Mr. Gorham particularly was of that opinion. Finally the Report was entered on the Journal without any act of Congress thereon, by a unanimous concurrence.(2) ""

  My dear friend, Philada. 17 June 1783. Your favor of the 4th, the second from Williamsburg,(1) was rcd. yesterday. I have recd. nothing from Mr. Hay during your absence from Richmond, but omission has been supplied by Mr. Ambler whose letter by yesterday's mail inclosed the Journals from the beginning.(2) Perhaps this supply was known to Mr. H. The definitive Treaty is not yet on this side the wa[te]r; nor do we yet hear what stage it is in on the other side. Mr. Dana informs us in a letter of the 17 Feby. that in consequence of proper encouragement he had finally announced himself at the Court of Petersbg. but does not gratify us with a single circumstance that ensued.(3) The gazette of this morning inclosed contains the latest intelligence from the British Parliamt. which I have seen.(4) The measure of furloughing the troops enlisted for the war has been carried into effect with the main army, and will save a great expence to the public. The prospect which it presented to the officers who were to retire from their subsistance with out receivg. the means of subsistance elsewhere produced a very pathetic representation to the Commander in chief. His answer by rectifying some errors on which it dwelt, and explicitly giving it as his opinion that Congress had now done every thing wch. could be expected from them towards fulfilling the engagements JUNE 17, 1783  of their Country, had the effect to which it was entitled.(5) The troops in the barracks at this place, emboldened by the arrival of a furloughed Regt. returning to Maryland, Sent in a very mutinous remonstrance to Congress, signed by the non-commissioned officers in behalf of the whole. It painted the hardships which they had suffered in the defence of their country & the duty of their Country to reward them, demanding a satisfactory answer the afternoon on which it was sent in, with a threat of otherwise taking such measures as would right themselves. The prudent & soothing measures taken by the Secy. at war & Gl. Sinclair have I believe obviated the embarrassment.(6) Another embarrassment, and that not a small one will soon be laid before them by a Committee.(7) Genl. Washington, the Secy. at war and all the professional men who have been consulted, report, that at least 3 or 4 Regts. will be essential as a peace establishmt. for the U States, & that this establishmt. ought to be a Continental one. West point, the fronteir forts to the Westward, and a few garrisons on the Sea Shore, are conceived by them to be indispensable. Some Naval force is deemed at least equally so, with a few docks & protections for them. On looking into the articles of Confederation, the military power of Congress in time of peace, appears to be at least subject to be called in question. If Congress put a construction on them favorable to their own power, or even if they ask the States to sanction the exercise of the power, the present paroxism of jealousy may not only disappoint them, but may exert itself with more fatal effect on the Revenue propositions. On the other side to renounce such a construction, and refer the establishment to the separate & internal provision of the States will not only render the plan of defence either defective in a general view or oppressive to particular states, but may hereafter when the tide of prejudice may be flowing in a contrary direction, expose them to the reproach of unnecessarily t[hrowing] away a power necessary for the good of the Union, and leaving the whole at the mercy of a single State. The only expedient for this dilemma seems to be delay; but even that is pregnant with difficulties equally great; since on the arrival of the definitive Treaty Congs must in pursuance of such a neutral plan suffer the whole military establishmt. to be dissolved, every garrisoned-post to be evacuated, and every strong hold to be dismanttled. The remaining ships of war too must be sold, and no preparatory steps taken for future emergences on that side. I am exceedingly pleased to find Mr. Jefferson's name at the head of the new Delegation. I hope it has been placed there with his knowledge and acquiescence.(8) The order of the day for electing a Secy. of F. Affairs was called for on Teusday last, but no nominations having been then made, the business was put off till the present day. The nominations since made are Mr. A. Lee by Mr. Bland--Mr. Jonathan Trumbell Junr. by Mr. Higgenson--Col. Tilghman by Mr. Ghorum--Mr. George Cly-  mer by Mr. Montgomery. Genl. Schyler has remained on the list since the fall, but was withdrawn by the Delegates of N. Jersey at the instance of Mr. Hamilton. Mr. Jefferson was nominated by Mr. Ghorum, but withdrawn also on intimation that he would not undertake the service.(9) If Mr. Jones sd. have quitted Richmond forward if you please of his letter, It is addressed to you in his absence. It contains little which is omitted in this, but you may open it. If he sd. not be gone you will let him see this, as it is somewhat fuller than his. ""

  Sir Philadelphia June 17th. 1783 Since our last to Yr. Excellency,(1) little has occurr'd worthy of communication. A Letter from General Washington encloses a very feeling address from the Officers of that part of the Army, comprehended in the late Resolution of Congress hertofore transmitted to Yr Excelly. Their minds too much agitated by the contemplation of prospects, cruel & dispiriting, gave way to suspicions (founded on the indefinite terms of the furlough) that this mode was adopted to disperse them, & to avoid a compliance with that part of their request which, related to paym't on their discharge. They lamented but in strong & manly terms that they were to end their toils & hardships by returning to inevitable distress, without any alleviation of their present wants. They implor'd his interference as their General & as their friend. The Commander in Chief then explained to them--That this measure was calculated to promote their interest, without endangering the safety of the States. That by this means the money which must otherwise be expended in their subsistance, woud now be appropriated to the paymt. of part of their dues. He said, that in justice to Congress, he could not but declare his sentiments. That they had made every exertion within their Power to obviate the present distresses of & to procure final justice to the Army. By this prudent, wise & noble conduct of General Washington gathered discontents, which now seemed again ready to JUNE 18, 1783  burst forth, were on[c]e more happily assuaged--& the Resolution of Congress were quietly complied with.(2) A Spirit of Mutiny discovered itself in the Troops immediately in Phila. that at first wore an alarming aspect, but by timely exertion it terminated without any ill consequences.(3) Yr. Excellency will receive the Pamphlett you require.(4) We have the honor to be &c. Yr. Excellency's most obt. humble Servants J. Madison Jr. John F. Mercer ""

  Sir, Philadelphia 18th June 1783 Enclosed you have an official letter, directed to our Ministers Plenipotentiary at Paris.(1) The resignation of the late Secretary for Foreign Affairs (occasioned by his preference of the Chancellorship of New York, which he could not hold longer and retain his Secretaryship) has cast this business on me till a Successor is elected, which I hope will speedily take place. As part of the Resolution of Congress of the 12th instant, enclosed in the above letter is of a secret nature, I have wrote it in Cyphers; and not having Mr. Livingston's, I thought it best to use Mr. Morris's to you, which he has obligingly supplied me with, so that the Commissioners must be indebted to you for the deciphering of it.(2) Your letter to Mr. Livingston of the 15th of April, enclosing the two Medals, came to hand this morning.(3) I am sorry to find that you make similar complaints to those we have been making for two months past, on the subject of want of intelligence. We have not heared from any of our Commissioners since February, tho' our anxiety and expectations have been wound up to the highest pitch. I feel myself much indebted for your polite compliment of the Medal. It is very elegant indeed; and the device and workmanship much admired. You will please to accept of my acknowledgments on this occasion. As I doubt not but the Copper one was designed for Mr.  JUNE 18, 1783  Livingston personally, I shall transmit it to him. He is a very worthy deserving Character, and the United States will suffer greatly by his resignation, tho' I really think him justified in attending to the calls of his private affairs. I enclose you a number of late Newspapers, in which you will see a number of Resolves, Associations &c. from all parts of the Country, which, I wish had been kept out of sight; but the truth is, that the cruelties, ravages and barbarisms of many of the Refugees and Loyalists have left the people so sore, that it is not the time for them yet to exercise their cooler Judgment; and it cannot take place while the Citizens of New-York are kept out of their habitations and despoiled daily of their property by sending off Negroes &c.

The newspapers from Boston annunce your being again returned to represent the Town of Danvers,(1) which gave me sensible pleasure, & please to accept my sincere congratulations. To what cause shall I impute it that I have not been favored with a line from you since I left home. I understand by my correspondence, that the commutation made with the officers of the army is not agreeable to the good people in our State, which I am sorry for, but altho' they mean well, it is very difficult for them to form a right judgement upon the matter, unless they were made more acquainted with the subject; but it should be re- JUNE 18, 1783  membered that some years since Congress promised the officers half-pay for life, & tho' I was not in Congress at that time, yet, I considered myself bound in Honor & justice to make good the promise, & after great deliberation, I was of opinion, & still am, that we had better give them five years ful pay, than half pay for life. This Congress has agreed to & the officers have also agreed to accept the same; the exchange made with the officers will be much in favor of Massachusetts for we shall now pay only our part of the sum, which if it had not been done by Congress, but referred to the states to pay their own officers, such states as did not comply, their officers, no doubt, wou'd have been paid out of the continental Treasury, & it wou'd have been very difficult to have got such accounts adjusted & settled hereafter, as the states that are most forward to make grants are not always the first to pay.

  Thursday June 19. [1783](1) A motion was made by Mr. Williamson seconded by Mr. Bland, to recommend to the States to make it a part of the Confederation, that whenever a fourteenth state should be added to the Union, ten votes be required in cases now requiring nine. It was committed to Mr. Williamson, Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Madison.(2) The motion had reference to the foreseen erection of the western part of N. Carolina into a separate State. Information was recd. by Congress from the Executive Council of Pennslyvania, that 80 Soldiers, who would probably be followed by the discharged Soldiers of Armand's Legion were on the way from Lancaster to Philadelpa. in spite of the expostulations of their officers, declaring that they would proceed to the seat of Congress and demand justice, and intimating designs agst. the Bank. This information was committed to Mr. Hamilton, Mr. Peters, and Mr. Ellsworth for the purpose of conferring with the Executive of Pennsylvania and taking such measures as they should find neccssary.(3) The Committee after so conferring informed Congress, that it was the opinion of the Executive that the militia of Philadelpa. would probably not be willing to take arms before their resentments should be provoked by some actual outrage; that it would hazard the authority of Govt. to make the attempt, & that [it] would be neccessary to let the soldiers come into the City, if the officers who had gone out to meet them, could not stop them.(4) At this information Mr. Izard, Mr. Mercer & others being much displeased, signified that if the City would not support Congress, it was high time to remove to some other place.

[see the Report of the Committee on that subject](1) The Report of the Committee [see the Journal] on the territorial Cession of Virga. being taken up, & the amendment on the Journal proposed by Mr. McHenry & Mr Clarke, being lost,(2) Mr. Bedford proposed that the second condition of the Cession be so altered as to read \""that in order to comply with the said Condition, so far as the same is comprized within the Resolution of Ocr. 10, 1780, on that subject,\"" Commissioners as proposed by the Committee, be appointed &c. and that instead of \""for the purposes mentioned in the said Condition,\"" be substituted \""Agreeable to that Resolution.\"" In support of this alteration, it was urged by Mr. McHenry, Mr. Bedford & Mr Clarke that the terms used by Virga. were too comprehensive & indefinite. In favor of the Report of the Committee, it was contended by Mr. Ellsworth that the alteration was unreasonable inasmuch as Civil expences were on the same footing of Equity as Military and that a compromize was the object of the Committee. Sundry members were of opinion that Civil expences were comprized in the Resolution of Ocr. 10, 1780. Mr. Bland & Mr. Mercer acceded to the alteration proposed. Mr. Madison alone dissented, and therefore did not insist on a Call for the votes of the States.

In the course of debate Mr. Clarke laid before Congress the Remonstrance of New Jersey as entered on the Journal.(3) As the Report had been postponed at the instance of the President & other Delegates of N.

They supposed that if it had been laid before Congress sooner the copy which would have been sent by the Virga. Delegates, might hasten the opening of the Land Office of that State.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia 21 June 1783, 4 O'Clock P.M. I am greatly mortified that our circumstances here oblige me to trouble your Excellency with a detail highly disagreeable and perplexing. I presume your Excellency has recd. copies of letters from Colo. Butler and Mr. Henry, forwarded a few days ago.(1) All endeavours to oblige the Men to return to Lancaster proved ineffectual. They entered this City yesterday morning in a very orderly manner, and took possession of the Barracks, and with those Troops then quartered there make up about 500 men. Genl. St. Clair was sent for, and matters seemed tolerably easy till this morning, when they positivily refused all obedience to their Officers and seemed forming a design to be troublesome by evening. Congress being adjourned till Monday, I thought proper to call them together at one O'Clock. Six States had got together, when the Mutineers, joined by those at the Barracks before their arrival, to the amount of 4 or 500, very unexpectedly appeared before, and surrounded, the State House, with fixed Bayonets, the Supreme Executive Council sitting also in the same House. The Mutineers sent in a paper, demanding of the President & Council to authorize them to choose their own Officers (being deserted by their former Officers as they alledged) in order to represent their grievances--That they should wait twenty minutes, and if nothing was then done, they would turn in an enraged Soldiery on the Council, who would do themselves Justice, and the Council must abide the consequences, or words to that effect.(2) Genl. St. Clair was present at the request of Congress, and but very few other officers attended. Neither Congress or the Council, would take any measures while they were so menaced, and matters continued thus till half past 3 O'Clock this af- JUNE 21, 1783  ternoon, when the Mutineers were prevailed on, for the present, to march back to the Barracks. They have secured the public Magazine, and I am of opinion that the worst is not yet come. Tho' no Congress was regularly formed, for want of one Member, yet the Members present, unanimously directed me to inform your Excellency of this unjustifiable movement. The Militia of the City I suppose will be called out, but there are some suspicions, that the Mutineers value themselves on their interest with the Inhabitants. It is therefore the wish of the Members who were assembled,(3) that your Excellency would direct a movement of some of your best troops, on whom you can depend; under these circumstances, towards this City; as it will be of the most dangerous consequence, if a measure of the Kind is to be put up with, and no one can tell when it will end. Your Excellency shall hear from me again on this subject without delay. I forgot to inform your Excellency that the Month's pay for January, has been ordered to these Men and three Month's pay &c. in Notes. They complain heavily of their Accounts yet remaining unsettled. It is to be wished the Pay-Master could arrange matters so as to close the Accounts of the Soldiery with more expedition. I have the honor to be, Your Excellency's Most obedt. & very humb. Serv.

  Saturday June 21. 1783(1) The mutinous soldiers presented themselves, drawn up in the Street before the State House where Congress had first assembled. The Executive Council of the State sitting under the same roof, was called on for the proper interposition. President Dickinson came in, and explained the difficulty under actual circumstances, of bringing out the militia of the place for the suppression of the mutiny. He thought that without some outrages on persons or property the temper of the militia could not be relied on. Genl. St. Clair then in Philada. was sent for; and desired to use his interposition, in order to prevail on the troops to return to the Barracks. His report gave no encouragement. In this posture of things, It was proposed by Mr. Izard that Congs. shd. adjourn.(2) It was proposed by Mr. Hamilton that Genl. St. Clair in concert with the Executive Council of State should take order for terminating the mutiny. Mr. Reed moved that the Genl. shd. endeavor to withdraw the troops by assuring them of the disposition of Congs. to do them justice. It was finally agreed that Congs. shd. remain till the usual hour of adjournment, but without taking any step in relation to the alledged grievances of the Soldiers, or any other business whatever. In the mean time the Soldiers remained in their position, without offering any violence, individuals only occasionally uttering offensive words and wantonly pointing their muskets to the Windows of the JUNE 21, 1783  Hall of Congress. No danger <<of actual> from premeditated violence was apprehended, But it was observed that spirituous drink from the tipling houses adjoining began to be liberally served out to the Soldiers, & might lead to hasty excesses. None were committed however, and about 3 oC. the usual hour, Congs. adjourned; the Soldiers, tho' in some instances offering a mock obstruction, permitting the members to pass thro' their ranks. They soon after retired themselves to the Barracks. In the Evening Congress re-assembled and passed the Resolutions on the Journal, authorizing a Committee to confer anew with the Executive of the State and in case no satisfactory grounds shd. appear for expecting prompt & adequate exertions for suppressing the mutiny & supporting the public authority, authorizing the President with the advice of the Committee, to summon the members to meet at Trenton or Princeton in New Jersey. The Conference with the Executive produced nothing but a repetition of doubts concerning the disposition of the militia to act, unless some actual outrage were offered to persons or property. It was even doubted whether a repetition of the insult to Congress would be a sufficient provocation. During the deliberations of the Executive, and the suspense of the Committee, Reports from the Barracks were in constant vibration. At one moment the Mutineers were penitent & preparing submissions. The next they were meditating more violent measures. Sometimes the Bank was their object; then the seizure of the members of Congress with whom they imagined an indemnity for their offence might be stipulated. On Tuesday about 2 oClock the efforts of the State authority being despaired of, & the Reports from the Barracks being unfavorable, the Committee advised the President to summon Congress to meet at Princeton which he did verbally as to the members present, leaving behind him a general Proclamation for the Press.(3) After the departure of Congs. the Mutineers submitted, and most of them accepted furloughs under the Resolution of Congress, on that subject. At the time of submission they betrayed their leaders, the chief of whom proved to be a Mr. Carberry a deranged officer, and a Mr. Sullivan a lieutenant of Horse; both of whom made their escape. Some of the most active of the Sergeants also ran off.(4) ""

  Dear sir,(1) Philada. 21st June 1783 Some days ago I was informed by Dr. Ewing that he had recd a Letter from you dated at Bath, intended to've been sent by Mr Lawrence in which you mention your being setled at Exeter. A younger Brother wrote me near two Years ago that he had seen or heard of you but I did not know, till the arrival of the Latter above refer'd to, that you continued to be numbered among the living. To you who was born an American and are now a british Subject tis hard to conjecture what feelings the approach of American Peace with Independence must excite. You cannot fail to be pleased with the Event, but I suspect you must envy the men who have ventured their Lives in establishing this fair Empire. The Poet was not mistaken when he said that the remembrance of past Labour (and of past Danger) is plesant. Through the course of Life I have in general intended to deserve well of the public, but there has been no part of my Life in which I am persuaded that I have so fully answered the End of my Existence as since the Beginning of the late Revolution. Having heartily wished and endeavoured to prevent the war, when it became necessary on our Side I have as heartily taken my share in it. You know that in 1779 the War was carry'd to the southward where it raged with additional fury. It was my fate to serve in the Carolinas and Virga. and to witness a War of carnage & desolation. In some Part of the Time I acted as an Aid to the Genl with whom I served, but in most of the Time I was Surgeon Genl. Tho I have seen the Enemy hang up our People in Dozens, tho I have seen them destroy with the Bayonet multitudes of cripled men & men who had surrendered, and have, when my duty has taken me among them with a flag, seen them treat hundreds of Prisoners in such a manner as to secure their Death, I now reflect with Pleasure that in no Part of my Conduct as an Officer in the Line nor in any advice that I ever was provoked to give have I ever done or advised to an Action that could put Humanity to the Blush. After sleeping Every month of the Year, Summer and Winter in the field you will probably be surprised when I tell you that I never before enjoyd such good Health. Nor can I say that I have always been very JUNE 21, 1783  careful of myself. For I confess, though I never despaird of the State, there has been a Time when disasters crowded so thick upon us, that I held Life very cheap; but the bullets pass'd by & a brighter Sun dispelld the Clouds. How strangely has the Storm thundered through every State in the Union, & the whole is succeeded by a fine Horizon. After the Capture of Cornwallis's Army & the pretty general Expulsion of the enemy from the Southern States, & returning to civil Life, I took my Seat in the general Assembly & on May last was a Year I was chosen one of the Delegates in Congress of the State of No. Carolina. On the last Month I was re-elected and tho I have wished that with the War my Attention to public Business might cease, I have entered on the second Year of the Delegation. You I think was one of two or three to whom I confided the Secret that I was coming immediately for America when I left London. You know that I happened to fall among Thieves on my Way or what is as bad, among Traitors & Scoundrels. One of the Junto has since given me personal Satisfaction and the others have fully satisfyd the world that they are what I have just styled them. I confess I have found that more fortitude was required, coolly to despise an unjust charge than to face an Enemy, It was the exercise of practical Philosophy & the severest Tryal of Patriotism I ever experienced. I think I committed to your Care a small Packet of Papers sealed up. They were, some of them, of value. And having no particular Attention to the rest of the Articles I left in London, I flattered myself those Papers would be safe in your Hands. Be so good as cover them as a Packet of Letters and direct them to this Place for me. As I have not for a considerable Time seen my family and may probably be absent from this three or four months, towards the beginning of Winter, in order to pay some attention to my private Affairs. You will be so good as inclose the whole Packet under another Cover directed to the Delegates in Congress for the State of North Carolina. If I should be out of Town when it arrives, my Collegues will receive it and retain or forward it as they may judge proper. I suspect Dr Ewing is not a very punctual Correspondent; however I shall drop a Line to your father & to yr Sister & try to secure an Answer to your Letters of which I shall assure them care shall be taken. You it seems have been unfortunate; for I cannot suppose you have neglected your duty, you have but two children. I hope Mrs. Ruston is in good Health. I hope she retains her Enthusiasm for America. I wish she could come to it & had a Dozen boys to bring with her. Be pleased present her wth my Respects. I have the Honor to be, with the utmost Consideration, yr obdt hble Serv, Hu Williamson P.S. The Spirit of Emigration we have Reason to believe will again prevail in difft. Parts of Europe in which Case I presume that Pennsylva JUNE 23, 1783  will not as formerly be the only Place of Resort. It is certainly more easy to live in a southern Climate, for Planters especially, where the Winter is more moderate. N. Carolina is generally accounted sickly and it has some Claim to that Character along the sea Shore in the flat Country, but the rest of the State is second to no Part of America in Point of Health. I have not ventured on this Assertion from strong prejudices in favour of that State, to which I am strongly attached nor from the Desire of improving my own Property which is considerable in that State, but from attentive observation in the Course of several Years. And by the way unless I am mistaken & unless I shall be greatly disappointed N Carolina will in the Course of a few Years be a Place of great Trade. ""

  My dear Brother Philada. 23 June 1783 I have only a moment to inform you, that there has been a most dangerous insurrection and mutiny among a few Soldiers in the Barracks here. About 3 or 400 surrounded Congress and the Supreme Executive Council, and kept us Prisoners in a manner near 3 hours, tho' they offered no insult personally. To my great mortification, not a Citizen came to our assistance. The President and Council have not firmness enough to call out the Militia, and allege as the reason that they would not obey them. In short the political ManOEuvres here, previous to that important election of next October, entirely unhinges Government. This handful of Mutineers continue still with Arms in their hands and are privately supported, and it is well if we are not all Prisoners in a short time. Congress will not meet here, but has authorized me to change their place of residence. I mean to adjourn to Princeton if the Inhabitants of Jersey will protect us. I have wrote to the Governor particularly. I wish you could get your Troop of Horse to offer them aid and be ready, if necessary, to meet us at Princeton on Saturday or Sunday next, if required. I would not wish any thing to be made more public than is necessary for the above purpose. I wish Jersey to shew her readiness on this occasion, as it may fix Congress as to their permanent residence. The Express will call for an Answer. Am in great Haste with Love to all, Yours Afftly.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia 23d June 1783 It gives me great concern to inform your Excellency of the detail of our affairs here, that will be extremely mortifying to every friend to his Country. On Thursday last we received information that the Troops at Lancaster to the number of about 60 had mutinied and marched for this City. Congress immediately by a Committee applied to the executive of this State to call out the Militia to stop their progress in order to prevent their junction with the troops in the Barracks, who were also uneasy on account of not receiving every thing they chose to ask. It soon appeared that the State of politicks here, prevented the President and Council from shewing any spirit of decision on this alarming subject; and we recd. for answer that it was thought that the Militia would not turn out for this purpose. The Mutineers arrived on Thursday morning and marched to the Barracks in decent order. On Friday hearing of no disturbance and that the Soldiers generally obeyed their Officers, Congress adjourned till Monday, continuing the Committee to apply to the State for aid. On Saturday morning one of the Committee reported to me that the whole of the Troops (about 500) had got into a very ill temper and that he believed they had a design of attacking and plundering the Bank during the following night. I summoned Congress to meet in half an hour. About one OClock on Saturday the Members had convened (except one) sufficient to make a House, when, without the least previous notice, we were surrounded by about 400 men with fixed Bayonets under the command of 6 or 7 Serjeants, having cast off all their Officers--The President and Supreme Executive Council sitting in the same House. The Members present immediately determined not to proceed to any deliberations whatever, if a full Congress should attend, while they were thus menaced. The Rioters sent in to the President of the State, a very threatening and insulting letter, threatening to let in an enraged Soldiery on him and the Council, if an answer was not recd. in 20 minutes. Thus we continued till near 4 O'Clock. The Executive of the State made no efforts to raise any force to repel them and no offers from the City (to their everlasting reproach) worth noting were made to relieve either their Executive Authority or Congress from this humiliating and dishonorable situation. Congress not thinking it prudent to attempt to leave the House till the usual time of adjourning remained Spectators of this insult to the dignity and honor of the fOEderal Government, having called on Genl St. Clair and ordered him to take measures for <<ordering> obliging the Mutineers to return to the Barracks. Congress then broke up and left the House and were suffered JUNE 23, 1783  by the Rioters to pass unmolested, Genl. St Clair having persuaded them to return to their Barracks. Congress met in the evening and came to some proper Resolutions on the subject, among which one was authorizing me, in case the Executive Council should not draw out an efficient force for the protection of Congress to summon a meeting in New Jersey. This force is refused us, at least the Council do not choose to call it out, altho' I think their City in great danger. A large number of Members of Congress have just met at my House, to consider the propriety of leaving the City. One objection to it has been made, that as we have met with no protection from the Citizens of Philada. how can we be assured that the Citizens of New-Jersey will be more respectful to Congress, if an insult should be offered to them in that State; and it will be absolutely necessary that Congress (wherever they adjourn to) should be enabled to return and quell the mutiny, to heal the wounded honor of the States. I propose, if nothing more dignified shall be done on the part of Congress, to adjourn them to Princeton, as I doubt not of the fullest protection of my fellow Citizens of New-Jersey. But by the advice of some Members I have thought proper to write to your Excellency this detail, and to request by the return of the Express that Congress may know your sentiments on the subject,(1) and I wish for my own part that such orders may be issued to the Militia (especially the troops of Horse) of Somerset, Hunterdon &c. as may enable Congress to call on them immediately on their arrival in Jersey, as may appear absolutely necessary. The honor and dignity of the United States are at stake and the benefits to New-Jersey will not be lessened. In case we move, Congress have ordered me to inform your Excellency of the movement(2) and doubt not but it will be agreeable to the Government. The Mutineers still continue in the Barracks in possession of the Arsenal and Magazine, and nothing but force can bring them to obedience. There are no higher Officers with them than Serjeants. I forgot to inform your Excellency that many of the Mutineers have not been enlisted above 4 or 5 Months. I have the honor to be, with great respect, Sir, your Excellency's Most obedt. & very humb. Servt, Elias Boudinot P.S. I have wrote this in so great a hurry & so many round me, that I must beg your Excly not to make it publick, or to alarm the People more than is necessary.

  Sir. Philadelphia June the 24th. 1783 We have long since wished to be able to give your Excellency some certain information respecting the definitive Treaty; and the more so, as it has never been in our power to explain the provisional one, which we observed in a former Letter. Congress were some time in uncertainty whether to ratify or not, but that finally they did ratify it and sent it to be exchanged if necessary.(1) Since which 'til this week we have not had any dispatches from our Ministers, and now we have not any assurances that the definitive Treaty will be speedily compleated or that the Posts in the United States will be evacuated sooner than \""with all convenient speed\"" of which the British seem to be the judges. In April Mr. Fox told Mr. Lawrance who complained of their  JUNE 24, 1783  Portrait of Benjamin Hawkins  tardiness that orders should be sent immediately to Sir Guy Carleton to evacuate New York and he would furnish him a Copy of the order to our ministers at Paris. Congress have received a Copy of the Treaty of amity and Commerce entered into on the 3d Day of April with the King of Sweden, it is in French, and as far as I could judge at first-reading agreeably to our Instructions in every point, a perfect equality and reciprocity. Assoon as it is ratified a Copy will be sent on to you.(2_ On Saturday about 12 oClock two hundred and eighty armed Soldiers led by Ser jeants marched to & surrounded the State House while six States were there, and several other members, and the President & Council of this State. They sent in a very indecent letter to the latter, demanding an answer in fifteen minutes or they would let in an enraged Soldiery on them, about 3 oClock the Members of Congress returned to their respective Houses without meeting any personal insult, and a short time after the soldiers returned to the Barracks. Congress have expressed their sense of this mutiny and insult to the Executive who are either too timid or undecisive to quell the mutiny & bring the heads of the mutineers to punishment, and what is more surprising and perhaps fatal to the Union, it is said that there could not be a force collected in this City to effect it. In this State of things what can Congress do, without the means of paying those debts they Constitutionally contracted for the safety of the United States, respo[n]sible for every thing, and unable to do any thing, hated by the Public creditors, insulted by the Soldery and unsupported by the Citizens? There are but seven States in Congress now and altho' we have repeatedly written to the States to send up Delegates, yet we cannot get enough to ratify the Treaty of Commerce with Sweden, and to fix the peace establishment, or in short to do any business pending before Congress. I am now living on credit and if it should not be in the power of your Excellency to furnish money for us, I shall be in a very disagreeable as well as disgraceful situation in a short time.

Their grievances all terminate as you may [sup]pose in the want of their pay which Congs. are unable to give them; and the information we receive from the States is far from opening any fresh sources for that purpose.

Attended Congress, when 6 States with several individual Members being present upwards of 300 Armed Soldiers of the Pennsylvania Line appeared before the State House & surrounded the same. Congress sent for Genl St Clair & requested to know the meaning of so hostile an Appearance round the House. He informed, that the Soldiers at the Barracks had cast off all authority of their Officers & had marched under the direction of a number of Sergeants to the State House in a mutinous & menacing manner. The President of the Sup. Ex. Council of the State came in & presented a Paper he had recd from the sd Sergeants purporting that they requested to be authorized to appoint Officers from their own Body in the room of those who had deserted them,(2) that they would wait 20 Minutes for an Answer, and if not recd they would turn in an enraged Soldiery on them & they must abide the Consequence. On reading this, Congress determined that they would not deliberate on or determine any Business while Surrounded in so menacing a Manner--but directed Gen St. Clair by such Means as were in his Power, to remove the mutineers to the Barracks immediately. Genl. St. Clair soon after returned & informed Congress that he hoped they would return to their quarters quietly. Congress left the House & passed thro' the ranks of Mutineers without opposition. When the President had got half way home--6 or 7 of the Men followed him with their Arms & requested his return, but on his way one of the Sergeants met him & desired him not to regard the Men who had gone without order. The Mutineers returned to their Barracks with Drums beating & fifes playing. Before the Members left the room they directed The President to send an Express to the Comr in Chief, informing him it was their request that he should advance a Body of Troops towards Philadelphia for the purpose of supporting the dignity of the Government. The President wrote accordingly. Saturday Afternoon--Summoned Congress to meet at 6 oClock. Met accordingly & came to several resolutions.(3) print resolutions. Sunday Morning forwarded resolutions by Express to the Comr in Chief.(4) JUNE 26, 1783  It being reported that the Mutineers had it in Contemplation to seize the Members of Congress at their Lodgings the next night, the Presid gave Notice to the Members of the report.

Monday Morning wrote by Express to Gov Livingston (5) & vice Presid of New Jersey informing of the Transaction of Saturday & the design of Congress in Case of the Contingencey mentioned in resolution of removing into Jersey.

That they were ready to act under the direction of Congress in any way and in any Manner Congress should think Proper and therefore were instructed to wait the Presid orders which they would strictly obey.

  Princeton June 26t. 1783 Dear Sir, 9 OClock in the Evening I take the first Moment of Leisure since our Arrival here, to inform your Excellency that Congress have removed to this Place. The reasons of our Conduct, I cannot delay the Post to give you in full. They are in short contained in the enclosed Proclamation.(1) I think my last was on Monday,(2) the Committee appointed to Confer with the President & Council of the State, could not prevail to have the Militia called out to suppress the Rioters. They delayed till Tuesday 2 oClock in hopes of the good Sense of the Council finally prevailing, but finding all ineffectual & being told by the President as the Opinion of Council, that unless the Mutineers should go farther than they had done (viz. the making Congress & Council Prisoners) the Militia would not turn out, the Committee advised me to summon Congress agreeable to the resolution of Saturday. I accordingly issued the enclosed Proclamation & left the City. This Measure roused & alarmed the Council & Citizens and they began to see their own danger. On being informed that a Plan was in Contemplation to attack the Bank, the Militia to the amount of 100 were called out & kept under Arms all Tuesday Night. In the Morning the Proclamation getting among the Soldiers they also were alarmed, and began a Negotiation and many of them have laid down their Arms and it is said have empeached 5 of their Officers as at the Bottom of the Business. I wish some Citizens of Note may not be among the Number--two of the former viz Capt. Carberry & Lt. Sullivan made off as soon as they heard of the Submission. I am in hopes the Mutiny will be crushed. However at all Events the Members of Congress here, wish to see the detachment called for by Congress, come on. I write this as an Individual that your Excy. may be duly informed of what has passed. I should be glad to see your Excly with the detachment if consistant with your other Duties. JUNE 26, 1783  I have the honor to be with the greatest Regard & Esteem, Your Exclys Most Obed & Hble Elias Boudinot(3) ""

  My dear Sir Belmont Thursday evening [June 26, 1783](1) I have been detained here by a violent Fit of the Cholic (not a political one I do assure you) I could not proceed to join my Corps.(2) I shall go tomorrow by Day Light. I wish to have the true State of the Affairs respecting the Soldiery & Therefore beg you will give me every Information you can as I shall be in Princeton tomorrow Evening. I hear many Stories but know not how the Matter really is. It is said the State has made some Compromise & it is said they have not. Be this as it may after the Movement of Congress it is impossible they can make any Compromise as to Ringleaders, Instigators &c. Their own Justification necessarily involves a thorough Examination & decided Conduct. Much Animadversion will be exercised as to the Deportment of the State. The Executive could assure Congress, it will be said, of no Support while they were present & yet as soon as they had left the City of which due Notice was given the Militia were turned out & Efforts used to quell the Mutineers. I shall act a Part consistent with my Duty [to the] State but shall not forget I am a Representative of the United States & therefore wish to have every Information necessary for [...] Colleagues & cannot better obtain it than thro' your confid[ence &] Friendship.

  Sir, Princeton 27th. June 1783 The news of the removal of Congress from Philada. to this place will no doubt have reached you before now. It is a step they were obliged to take by the scandalous neglect of the Executive of Pennsylvania, to  JUNE 27, 1783  whom they applied for protection; and however some may assure them of precipitancy, they have no doubt of being able to justify their conduct to the world. Yesterday they assembled in this place, agreeable to the inclosed Proclamation,(1) and wanted but one member to make a House, who it is expected will appear to-day. The night before last the Minister of France left Philadelphia at 12 o'Clock, and arrived here at 8 yesterday Morning. He brought a Letter from the President of that State to the President of Congress(2) giving an account that the Soldiers in the Mutiny had laid down their arms, and submitted, except about 60 which arrived from Lancaster--that these had 24 hours to consider of it, and if they refused the others had promised to reduce them to submission. This good effect was certainly produced by the step we took, which was communicated to the soldiers by the President's Proclamation, a number of which were thrown into the Barrack yard on tuesday night. They have impeached two of their officers, Lieut Sulivan, and Lieut Carberry, who are not to be found. Three more are said to be guilty, and perhaps in the investigation of this business others may be drawn forth. An express was sent to General Washington on Saturday evening informing him of the Mutiny, and that it was the wish of Congress that a body of trusty troops might be put in motion towards the City; and notwithstanding present appearances it was the opinion of the Gentlemen who met yesterday that the orders ought not to be countermanded but that the troops should proceed to Philadelphia, and the commanding officer enter upon a full enquiry into the affair. The Governour of this State has written a Letter to the President of Congress assuring him of protection,(3) and addresses have been received from the governours of the College, and the inhabitants of Trenton & Princeton, assuring Congress of their firmest support, and expressing the high sense they have of the honor done them by their coming to reside in the State, and wishing their residence may be permanent. The inhabitants of Trenton and its vicinity had some few days before signed a Paper expressing their desire that Congress would fix upon a place, about a mile and an half below Trenton, for their permanent Residence,(4) and submitting themselves to their jurisdiction and the Legislature of the State offer them £30,000 specie to purchase Land wherever they may choose, and engage to give Congress an exclusive jurisdiction over 20 square miles. Pray what has Delaware done? We have certainly the best situation in the united States, and if a generous offer was made, (I do not mean of money, but territory and jurisdiction,) I still think we would have a good chance of its being accepted. It would give me great pleasure to see Dr. Tilton and Colo. Bedford. The latter I suppose is on his way here, therefore I need not press the JUNE 28, 1783  necessity of his coming. Congress wish to have a full representation from the states at this time, that the measures they may take for doing justice upon offenders, and thereby repairing the injuries done to their wounded honor, may have the greater weight. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your Excellency's most obedient and most humble Servts. E. McComb ""

  My dear Sir Princetown 28th June 1783 The account of the removal of Congress to this place will have preceeded this letter.(1) At first you would be surprised, but you would soon discover its propriety. The only thing at which you would not be surprised, would be the insufficiency of the Pennsylvania government to guard the honor and dignity of the United States, or preserve the JUNE 28, 1783  peace of their own citizens. Under these circumstances it was unlucky for Annapolis that a detachment of our line in passing through Philadelphia exhibited the same mutinous disposition as the Pennsylvania troops.(2) But for this, perhaps, a favorite scheme might have been carried into effect. But a removal to Annapolis would not have secured Congress from the soldiery, and this alone was enough to prevent it. Taking up the event however in a general view, I hope it will be favorable to our affairs; shew to all men the weakness of our confederation, and the absurdity of keeping men in a responsible situation without doing all in their power to furnish them with means to execute their trusts. I find that we shall have a tryal of heads to restore us to Philadelphia. The influence of the City will be exerted. Let me pray you to come forward on this occasion. You will be able to render essential service. If we can be kept from Philadelphia, the want of the necessary buildings and personal conveniencies will soon drive us from this place. You know that Maryland is without a vote. The definitive treaty has not arrived, the cession of Virginia is still unsettled, and we are yet without a peace arrangement. Give my most cordial respects to Mrs. Lee and beleive me always and affectionately yours, James McHenry ""

  Sir, Princeton, June 29th. 1783 It is proper I should inform Your Excellency that Congress have lately removed to this place. I cannot enter into a detail of the causes; but I imagine they will shortly be published for the information of the United States. You will have heared of a mutiny among the soldiers stationed in the barracks of Philadelphia, and of their having surrounded the state house where Congress was sitting. Fortunately no mischief insued. There was an insolent message sent to the Council. It was at once determined that should any propositions be made to Congress they would not take them into consideration whatever extremities might ensue, while they were surrounded by an armed force. General St Clair with the advice of some members of Congress and of the Council permitted the mutineers to appoint some commis- JUNE 29, 1783  sioned officers to represent their grievances and they were at last glad of a pretext for going away. Congress judged it proper to use coertion upon the occasion & having sent an order to the Commander in Chief for a detachment of troops, at the same time called for the assistance of the militia. The conduct of the executive of this state was to the last degree weak & disgusting. In short they pretended it was out of their power to bring out the militia, without making the experiment. This feebleness on their part determined the removal of Congress from a place where they could receive no support; and I believe they will not easily be induced to return. The removal and a proclamation by the President announcing to the mutineers that extremities would be persued against them have intimidated them into a submission. They have impeached two of their officers Carbury & Sullivan, who immediately fled. A few others are suspected. It is to be lamented that the offers from our state have not been upon a more acceptable plan;(1) it is probable if they had been, the scales would incline in our favour. I wish the Legislature were sitting and would enlarge them. To your Excellency I need not urge the advantages that will accrue to a state from being the residence of Congress.

  Dear Sir Princeton June 29th. 178[3] I am informed that among other disagreeable things said about the removal of Congress from Philadelphia it is insinuated that it was a contrivance of some members to get them out of the state of Pensylvania into one of those to which they belonged--and I am told that this insinuation has been pointed at me in particular. Though I am persuaded that all distinterested persons will justify Congress in quitting a place where they were told they were not to expect support (for the conduct of the Council amounted to that) yet I am unwilling to be held up as having had an extraordinary agency in the measure for interested purposes when the fact is directly the reverse. As you were a witness to my conduct and opinions through the whole of the transaction, I am induced to trouble you for your testimony upon the occasion. I do not mean to make a public use of it; JUNE 29, 1783  but through my friends to vindicate myself from the imputations I have mentioned. I will therefore request your answers to the following questions: Did that part of the resolutions which related to the removal of Congress originate with me or not? Did I as a member of the Committee appear to press the departure; or did I not rather manifest a strong disposition to postpone that event as long as possible, even against the general current of opinion? I wish you to be as particular & full in your answer as your memory will permit. I think you will recollect that my idea was clearly this: that the mutiny ought not to be terminated by negotiation--that Congress were justifiable in leaving a place where they did not receive the support which they had a right to expect; but as their removal was a measure of a critical and delicate nature--might have an ill appearance in Europe--and might from events be susceptible of an unfavourable interpretation in this country--it was prudent to delay it 'till its necessity became apparent, not only 'till it was manifest there would be no change in the spirit which seemed to activate the council, but 'till it was evident complete submission was not to be expected from the troops--that to give full time for this, it would be proper to delay the departure of Congress 'till the latest period which would be compatible with the idea of meeting at Trenton or Princeton on Thursday--perhaps even 'till Thursday morning.

  Sir Princeton 30th June 1783. I had the honor of addressing a long Letter to your Excellency from this place a few days ago,(1) which I hope you will receive. The events which have taken place since are easily recounted. I informed you that JUNE 30, 1783  the mutineers had begun to give way. The whole of them have since laid down their Arms, but have been suffered to resume them. The Party from Lancaster have been Marched back again under their officers, and the rest, (as we are informed,) are dismissed on furlough. This is a new way of settling such business. How the officers will account for it I am at a loss to know. Eleven hundred men from head Quarters will be here this evening, on their way to Philadelphia, under the command of Major General Howe, to enquire into this Business. Some Gentlemen want Congress to follow them, but others are extremely averse to return to Philadelphia again. This Town is too small for our Accommodation, tho' the People are very obliging. I wish to know whether the inhabitants of Wilmington would be pleased with such guests, and whether the Academy might be had for them to sit in. If good Accommodations could be had I would move that we should adjourn to that place. If the hill above the Town has been, or is to be, offered for their permanent residence, perhaps such a motion, on such information, might be carried. Several flattering addresses have been read in Congress to-day,(2) (the first day of our doing business here,) from the Governors of the College, the Inhabitants of Trenton & Princeton, and the Governor of the State. I am told the Batallions in the State, or at least in the neighbourhood, are preparing addresses, and I submit it to your Excellency whether such a Measure, if pretty generally adopted, would not have a happy effect both at home and abroad. The dignity and authority of the United States have been grossly insulted. It is natural therefore for those who are favourers of the fOEderal Government to declare their readiness to support and maintain it. If this had been done in Philadelphia, and accompanied with corresponding exertions, we would not have left that City; but instead of this Congress was shamefully neglected, and no measures taken for their protection 'till after they had left the City. Then the Militia was called out to defend private property, but it seems few of them obeyed the call. I am here alone Neither Mr. Bedford nor Dr. Tilton have made their appearance. I expect Mr. Bedford here every day. There are but seven states on the floor, so that perfect unanimity is requisite in order to do any business. Your Excellency will pardon the imperfection of this dispatch, which I have no time at present either to copy or correct, and believe me to be with great sincerity, Your most obt. & most humble sevt, E.

  My dear Sir Philada. June 30. 1783. My last informed you of the mutinous insult which was offered to Congs. on the Saturday preceding.(1) On the Evening after the insult Congs. met and resolved that the Executive Council sd. be informed that in their opinion effectual measures ought to be immediately taken for suppressing the mutiny & supporting the public authority--that a Come. sd. confer with the Executive and in case no Satisfactory grounds sd. appear of adequate & prompt exertions for those purposes, the Presidt. sd. with the advice of the Come. be authorized to summon the members to meet at Trenton or Princeton in N.J.--that an Express be sent to Genl. Washington for a detachment of regular troops. The Conference with the Executive produced nothing but doubts concerning the disposition of the Militia to act unless some actual outrages were offered to persons or property. They even doubted whether a repetition of the insult to Congs. wd. be a sufficient provocation. Neither the exhortations of the Friends of Presidt. Dickenson nor the reproaches of his enemies could obtain an experiment on the temper of the Militia. During the attendance on the ultimate determinations of the Executive reports from the Barracks were in constant vibration. At one moment the Mutineers were penitent and preparing submissions: the next they were meditating more violent measures. Sometimes the Bank was their object; at other times the seizure of the members of Congress, with whom they imagined an indemnity for their offence might be purchased. On Teusday about two OClock, the efforts of the Govt. being despaired of, and the reports from the Barracks being unfavorable, the Committee advized the President to summon the members to meet in N.J. which he did verbally as to the members present, leaving a general proclamation behind him for the Press.(2) I left Princeton on Friday evening when six States only had met. Rhode Islad. made a seventh on Saturday. To day I suppose they will be on business. I shall set out this afternoon, on my return.(3) Since Congress left the City the Mutiny has been entirely extin-guished; the Mutineers having submitted, and most of them accepted furloughs under the Resolution of Congress on that subject. At the time of submission they betrayed their leaders, the chief of whom prove to be a Mr. Carbery, a deranged officer, and a Mr. Sullivan a Lieutenant of Horse, both of whom made their escape. Some of the most active Sergeants have also ran off. The precise object & plan of the Conspiracy are unascertained. When I left Princeton no answer had been recd. from Genl. Washington.(4) The removal of Congs. under the circumstances which gave birth to it, is a subject of much conversation and criticism. Many of those who  JUNE 30, 17883  condemn it are but partially acquainted with facts. Many of those who justify it, seem to have their eye remotely on the disgrace of the Executive Councils of the State.

  Dear Hannah, Monday June 30. 1783. By nine o clock, the evening I left you, I arrived at Bristol, where I met the Minister on his return.(1) He informed me that a sufficient number of states had not yet met to proceed to business. He expressed a great desire that Congress would return, and was anxious that their removal should not even be known in Europe by any public act done out of Philadelphia. Next day I started a little after three and was in the boat at Trenton ferry before Six. The ride thus far was exceedingly pleasant, the morning Serene, and the air cool and refreshing. At Trenton I shaved, washed & breakfasted & waited till eight in hopes of seeing Govr. Morris. Mr. R. M.(2) had left town just before I got in to meet Mr. M. at Bristol and as he crossed at another ferry I missed him. Govr. was gone a fishing and though I sent him a note to inform him of my arrival, I suppose he thought it too great a sacrifice to forego the pleasure of fishing. As soon as I had breakfasted I set forward and travelling easy I arrived at Princeton about eleven. I had a fine air in my face but the sun beams were excessively hot & scorch JUNE 30, 1783  ing. I drove up immediately to Col. Morgan's which is just behind the college(3) in a most elegant situation commanding an extentive and delightful prospect. I have a parlour below stairs & a chamber above which though small is clean, cool and pleasant. Mrs. Morgan is easy, polite and agreeable as the colonel. The Col has thrown aside the citizen and put on the country gentleman, and enjoys that situation in life which in my Opinion is the most delightful. He has a farm of two hundred acres of good land, and enjoys the benefit of an Agreeable society. The town is small not much larger than Newark and the chief part of the houses small & built of wood. There are a number of genteel houses around & in the neighborhood. With respect to situation, convenience & pleasure I do not know a more agreeable spot in America. As soon as I had dressed I went to the College to meet Congress.(4) I was conducted along an entry (which runs from one end to the other through the middle of the college) & was led up into the third story where a few members were assembled. Whether it was design or accident that led me this way, I know not. But it had the effect of raising my mortification & disgust at the Situation of Congress to the highest degree. For as I was led along the entry I passed by the chambers of the students, from whence in the sultry heat of the day issued warm steams from the beds, foul linen & dirty lodgings of the boys. I found the members extremely out of humour and dissatisfied with their situation. They are quartered upon the inhabitants who have put themselves to great inconveniencies to receive them into their houses & furnish them with lodgings, but who are not in a situation to board them. The letter I brought from the Prest. of the State(5) was not calculated to remove their uneasiness or heal the wound they had received. It was dry and laconic and contained nothing that invited a return. When I left col. Morgan's I asked him whether I was to board as well as lodge with him. He told me he should be glad of my Company to dine with him as oft as was convenient & particularly that day but informed me he understood the gentlemen had agreed upon a plan of dining together at a tavern and had appointed a comee. to make the necessary arrangements (6) and that the gentlemen only breakfasted at their quarters. As that was the case I told him I would not trouble him, as I knew the hours of Congress would ill suit with rural OEconomy and that I would dine with the gentlemen though I was much afraid it would not answer well with my accustomed & regular mode of living. Ellery & Arnold had not yet arrived, so that there were not states sufficient to proceed to business. I had passed Ellery on the road about two miles from Philada & expected to meet him in the evening at Bristol, but he did not come up & did not reach Princetown till late on Saturday Evening. After some conversation about the news from Philada and present situation of Affairs the Prest. adjourned Congress to meet   Photographic Reproduction of Nassau Hall  again on Monday. He then told me he expected my company to dine with him. I said I understood the gentlemen had agreed to dine together at a tavern, and as their coming to this place must have been very unexpected, I fancied Mrs. Stockden (his sister at whose house he lodged)(7) could not be prepared to receive company and I had rather be excused. He told me he did not know whether the gentle-men had fixed their plan or taken arrangements for dining together though they talked of it & must certainly adopt some such measure if they continued in this place, But that he would expect my company to dine with him that day. I then enquired what plan they had adopted, & found they had yet come to no determination. Some had received invitations to dine with the president, others from private gentlemen, & some purposed to go to a tavern. I then conversed with individuals to know what steps they meant to take. Bland's dignity was so hurt that he would never return. Izard could never think of returning unless the citizens of Philadelphia would make reparation for the wounded honor of Congress. Hamilton's resentment was wholly bent against the president of the state and nothing but his ruin would satisfy him. I wished them to consult their reason and not their passions, to consider the interest of the Union and not private resentments. That a good use might be made of the late occurrence, if improved solely to the purpose of impressing the states with the necessity of taking speedy and effectual measures to comply with the obligations & perform the promises which Congress had made on their behalf. That the honor of Congress was safe if they returned speedily to their former place of residence and did not mix private passion with public measures. That the object which some seemed to have in view would I feared not answer their purpose. That an attempt to ruin the Prest. & criminate the council might foment the divisions & party animosity which unhappily too much prevailed in the state but would be far from strengthening the Union & supporting the fOEderal government. That by directing their resentment against the Pres. & council, or attempting to set the citizens against them, they might raise up friends & rather strengthen than ruin them. They could not be ignorant that there were many in Philada. who were unfriendly to our cause, who though they did not love the presidt. hated Congress & would espouse his cause against them or their cause against him not from a regard for one more than the other but from private resentments & with a view to embarrass public measures & that such a crop of dissensions might be sown in the state as might in the end involve it in the dispute or at least incapacitate it from pursuing those measures that were essential for the public safety. That in my Opinion the fate of America hung by a slender thread & it behoved Congress to act with caution. That I never had seen a period in which there was a greater necessity for the exercise of prudence & a temperate Conduct, & I was glad considering the temper of the members that they had not yet been   able to proceed to business. I told Hamilton freely that I entirely disapproved his plan, that I saw clearly it would give pain to the true friends of America and pleasure to its enemies: that the step Congress had yet taken required no justification of themselves or crimination of others. It was sufficient that they thought themselves in danger & removed out of the way of it & then returned to their duty and business when it was removed, and only pursued wise measures to present the like in future. And I wished him to reflect how far he might hazard the private characters of the present members who had but lately come to Congress, & who, it might be said, had by their rash, unwise & intemperate conduct dashed in pieces & overturned a fabric begun by their wiser predecessors & raised to such a height by the blood of so many thousands. I found myself at times warm, however I determined to unburthen my mind. I cannot forbear reprobating the conduct of our friend in Market Street,(8) and much I fear that his cursed pride will undo his country. He has his virtues but they are suited to other times. Could he have submitted to the least soothing language I am persuaded he would have found or at least the situation of affairs here would very soon have created a conciliating disposition in Congress. And affairs might have been restored to their former channel. But his passions are too ungovernable and his pride too great to acknowledge an error, till I fear it will be too late. After a good deal of Conversation with individuals & sometimes with several together, and no determination yet come to, where to dine, the presidents servant came to inform me that dinner was ready & the president waited for me. I therefore went and dined with him. There were three or four members who dined there. After dinner I had an Opportunity of conversing with the president and found he was desirous of returning. He said freely that this place would not do. The people had exerted themselves & put themselves to inconveniences to accommodate the members but it was a burden which they could not bear long. That there was no place where the Minister could be accommodated. In short it would not do. And that Congress must either go back to Philada. or remove to some other place. But that the members were not yet in temper, that they must have time to cool. Yesterday we had news that Major genl Howe is advancing with about Eleven hundred troops. They will be in this town to day. Ellery and Arnold arrived late on Saturday evening so that to day they may proceed to business. In my next I shall be able to give you some account of their disposition. I have written with more freedom because Mr Bond(9) carries this & will deliver it. Peter behaves well, his horses are just under my Eye in Mr Morgans stables & he lodges & diets with the family. My carriage is also safe under cover. I hope you and the family are well and that Page is a good boy. I am afraid you will have some trouble with the cow. I think  JULY 1, 1783  if she was kept in the lot and supplied with hay from Mr. Miller's & well fed twice a day with bran & well watered at least three times a day, it would save a great deal of trouble & would Answer better than suffering her to run out. Take care of your health. Remember me to Robert, Amelia, Jonathan & Peter & all enquiring friends.(10 )I shall desire Mr Bond while he is in town to call for and forward your letters & to have mine delivered to you.

  Dear Sir Princeton 1st July 1783 I am favoured with your Letter of 25th Ulto. How it came to be delayed I know not, but it did not get to my hands till yesterday Morning. That some people should affect to Believe that the departure of Congress was hasty is not surprising; their own justification depends upon propagating that opinion. I am however, fully perswaded that no honest, disinterested man in the World who is acquainted with the circumstances, can be of opinion that we could with propriety have staid longer in the City, after having been surrounded by an armed, & menacing Banditti, & after having applied in vain to the Executive Authority for protection. I can not help thinking that if the Militia had been called upon, or if application had been made to the most virtuous, & respectable part of the Citizens, such a dishonour would never have been suffered. I hope your information may prove true, that the Militia Officers intend to vindicate their own characters. Until that is done, & a full assurance given to Congress that they may depend on protection, I am of opinion they will not return to Philadelphia. Some interest making and caballing has been among the Members, but a great majority feel the indignity which has been offered them, & shew a great disinclination to return. Genl. Howe is arrived here with about Eleven Hundred of the Massachusets Line & proceeds with them tomorrow towards Philadelphia. The very extraordinary conduct of Col. Humpton in furloughing the Mutineers, at the very time he knew, from the Proclamation of the President, that Congress were adjourned to this place for the purpose of suppressing the Mutiny will embarrass us not a little. That proceeding, I hope, will be the subject of military investigation. We were not able to make a House until Monday, because both of the Rhode Island Members chose to continue in Philadelphia, to shew their courage; & we have now only seven States on the Floor; so that we must have unanimity, which is hardly ever to be expected, or we can do nothing. The Report of the Committee (Hamilton, Elsworth, & Peters) which had the repeated conferences with your President, & Council, has been made.(1) Some certain party Gentlemen object to it's being printed by order of Congress. The Facts which are therein stated will exhibit the President & Council of Pennsylvania to the World, in such colours as will not be JULY 1, 1783  very pleasing to the brave & virtuous part of the community. If the latter do not make their sentiments very explicitly known, I shall be much disappointed. I am determined the Report shall be printed either with, or without the order of Congress.(2) Your precaution respecting your Letter was very proper. The party politicks of Philadelphia are very plainly to be seen here; & therefore when you do me the honour of writing to me again, it will be better to follow the example I now give you, as I know your hand. I am Dr. Sr., with great regard, Your most Obt. Servt. ""

  Dr. Sir. Princtown 1 July 1783 You will have no reason to blame me for my silence, and yet my beginning with an excuse seems to imply its justice. I left you in Annapolis and when I left Baltimore I understood you were still there, and had proposed to go down the Bay with the governor; from all which I conclude this letter will be fortunate should it even now find you at home enjoying that retirement which I long to experience. I had scarcely entered Congress when the cession of territory by Virginia was taken up.(1) You have seen the conditions. There had been a report on these conditions and this was to be argued. Congress having embraced a conciliatory system, the question of right could not be opposed to the conditions. All that remained was to bring them down to what was reasonable. I carried an amendment to the second, which stripped Virginia of a source of charges against the United States, the extent of which it was impossible to ascertain. Finding that no other amendments would succeed, I had its further discussion postponed. To get as much as we can of this territory with the consent of Virginia seems to be the preponderating sentiment and indeed it may be, all things considered, the most prudent measure at present in our power. The United States are without force to support their claims. And should we delay receiving what Virginia is willing to give she may revoke the cession and open a land office. In this case there is no doubt but she will find purchasers, and that these will assert their claims. But without such an act the north west banks of the Ohio must in a little time be covered with the claims of adventurers, who will hold upon the title of occupancy. On the whole I am inclined to think, that we at JULY 1, 1783  least risque advantages by delay, that may not be counterbalanced by any cession to be expected hereafter. You know the land Virginia reserves to herself, and to which she has no right by the King of G. Britain's proclamation of 1763, lays between the Alleghany mountains and the Ohio. This it is said added to Virginia will make her too powerful. But it appears to me, that in a very short time it would secede from the dominion, and become what Congress would make it, an independent republic. The laws enacted at Richmond would either not be known--have no efficacy, or be laughed over the Alleghany. No doubt you will have heard before this of our adjournment. You would be surprised at the event, and puzled for the cause. The enclosed proclamation offers at a solution, which if unsatisfactory you must wait for a statement of the whole affair that will soon be published by Congress.(3) I will only say, that the danger from the mutineers was real, that no support could be obtained from the Executive and that the citizens discovered no disposition [to] take arms. I know not whether this event will convince the States of their real situation, of the weakness of the confederation, and how very near we have approximated to anarchy & bankruptcy. It is time however, that all men should know, that a breath of wind would break the few fretted threads that remain of the union; and that it is folly of the first rank [to] keep representatives responsible without their being provided with the means to discharge th[eir] trusts. How far this event may be favorable to the removal of Congress to Annapolis, I will not pretend to predict. To be out of Philadelphia is not to be in Annapolis, altho' it brings Congress a step nearer this point, by lessening the chances for that place. In this question, private considerations will act contrary to the general good. The Southern delegates [have] a leaning to a cold climate, and the northern gentlemen dread a warm one. I will work however, but it would be presumption to suggest a favorable issue to my labors. The present instant is promising as it respects the votes of Virginia, North & South Carolina, but then Georgia and Maryland is unrepresented, so that nothing can be done but shuffle the cards and be patient. Write me on this perplexing western territory business and believe me most cordially and sincerely your friend & hble St James McHenry [P.S.] No definitive treaty. ""

Every day and every hour adds to my chagrin and vexation. Nor can it be otherwise, while I see folly, weakness and passion marking the characters of those who ought to be distinguished by their wisdom and prudence. It is impossible to stay & do business here and yet from the disposition that prevails there is at present but little probability of a speedy return to Philadelphia. A public & continental use might have been made of the late occurrence: but passion has gained such ascendancy that that object seems quite lost.

  Dear Hannah, Friday July 4 1783 Yesterday I received your letter of the 2. It was a cordial to my Spirits which have been in a constant agitation since I left you. I had al- JULY 4, 1783  most determined to set out yesterday afternoon & celebrate the Anniversary of Independence with you in Philadelphia, and should certainly have done it, but that one of my horses was galled in coming up, & I was afraid of hurting him. The conveyance by the stage is so inconvenient & disagreeable that I am quite discouraged from attempting it. You will readily judge what probability there is of finding accommodations in Princeton, when I inform you that it is a small scattered village, consisting of about 50 houses most of them low wooden buildings, several of them tumbling to pieces & some new & unfinished. There are five or six tolerable good brick houses or with brick fronts two stories high & there are several good farm houses around. Mrs. Stockden's is a little way out of town. The house is large for a country house, it has four rooms on a floor commodious but not grand. There have been gardens & walks but they are all a waste & only the traces of them left. Here the president keeps his court. A little farther on & nearly Opposite, lives Thomas Laurens,(1) where Hamilton lodges. Laurens has a good farm of about 300 acres. But the house is in a bad situation. Still farther from the village on the way to Philada. is the farm now occupied by Mr Clymer.(2) It joins Mrs. Stockdens plantation. The house is well situated. It is more than a mile out of town. Here Mr. Fitzsimmons is quartered. These are the only places I have visited. Quarters are taken for the Maryland delegates about a mile distant on the road to Brunswick. The rest are scattered up and down in the village. Bland is got into a tolerable house opposite to the College. He says he has ordered up all his furniture, that part of it is come and that he expects all his Baggage up this week. Whether Mrs. B is included I know not, but the Minister thinks she will not like to leave Philada. I have some reason to think he was heartily frightened, and therefore affects greater concern for the wounded dignity of Congress. Besides he has but a little time to stay. His delegation ends in October & he cannot be continued longer. He can therefore the readier submit to inconvenience for a short time to gratify his resentment for the fright he was put in. The good of the public & continental considerations seem as yet to have little influence & to be wholly lost in private passion. I hope they will revive, and that as passion subsides, reason will reassume its place. At present all business is at a stand. There are only seven states represented And nothing of importance can be done without nine. Messages are gone to the states unrepresented urging them to send forward their delegates.  I am glad to hear you are well & that Amelia is getting better. You do not say a word of P. Lloyd. Has he not visited you? Peter behaves well & is very attentive to his horses. You may tell Page I am pleased to hear he is a good boy but should have been still better pleased if he had fanned away the flies that were so troublesome to you.  When Mr. Bond comes up I will leave him to officiate for me and take a trip to Philadelphia. I long to see you being with sincere affection, your loving husband, Cha Thomson P.S.

The Causes which induced them to take that resolution, your Excellency will find fully Explaind in the report of their Committe herewith enclosed.(2) We have little doubt but that the step will meet with the General approbation of our Constituents, when it is considered what pernicious Instruments Congress might have been made in the hands of a Lawless band of Armd Desperado's--and what fatal consequences might have ensued to the Union in General, had they remaind impotent and Passive Spectators of the most outrageous Insult to the Government, and to the Authority which is vested in them by the Federal Compact. On the part of Congress the most vigorous, and Immediate Exertions were made to preserve their Dignity and restore the Mutineers to that obedience due to Law and Government. A detachment was Immediately orderd from the Army to Suppress the Mutiny and restore order which passd by this place two days ago for Pennsylvania under the Command of Majr. Genl. Howe. We have Since heard that the Mutineers have returnd to their obedience but that most of the Ring leaders (among whom we are told were unhappily Six Commissd officers) have fled.

Without appearing I intend to give them to the public with some additional explanations. This done with moderation will no doubt have a good effect.

  My dear friend Philada. July 8. 1783. Yours of the 28 of June like the preceding one(1) found me at this place, where my preparations for leaving Congs. will keep me much of the remainder of my time.(2) The footing on which the Impost is placed by the Assembly is not an eligible one, but preferable to a total rejection. It is to be regretted that immediate use was not made of the impression of the letter from Genl. W.(3) The interval preceding the next Session will give full scope to malignant insinuations. The reversal of the award in the case of Nathan may possibly be just in itself, but it will require all your eloquence I fear to shield the honor of the State from its effects. The Agency which the Delegation had in the affair will impart no small share of the mortification to them. I suppose the feelings of Mr. Jefferson & Mr. Harrison also will not be much delighted by it.(4)  Genl. How is here with a corps of N. England troops detached by Gl. W. for the purpose of quelling the Mutiny. His only employment will now be to detect & punish the promoters of it. Congs. remain at Princeton. Their removal from that place will soon become an interesting question. Not a few maintain strenuously the policy of returning to this City in order to obviate suspicions abroad of any disaffection in the mass of so important a State to the fOEderal Govt. and to restore mutual confidence with a State which has of late been so firm in adhering to fderal measures. It is supposed too that a freer choice might here be made amg the permanent seats offered by the States, than at a place where the necessity of a speedy removal wd. give undue advantage to an offer which happened to be in greater readiness for immediate use. The Citizens here in general regret the departure of Congs., disavow the idea that they were unwilling to take arms in defence of Congs. and will probably enter into some declaration tending to invite their return.  We hear nothing from our Ministers in Europe. The evacuation of N. York as to the time seems as problematical as ever. The sending off the negroes continues to take place under the eyes & remonstrances of the Inspectors of Embarkations.(5) ""

I am glad to find that the Conduct of Council is so genrly. aproved of on the occasion. I most Sincerly pitted the good man our friend (2) but as I am not aquanted with the reasons and motives that influnced Council in not Calling the malitia I Can neither aplaude or find fault. Happey it is that the mutiney has been so Easley quelld but had it been otherwise what do you think woud have been thought and said. The Line of Council was Straight had they Calld the malitia and they not obey the Consequence woud have been laid at thire door and not JULY 8, 1783  at Councils and this was my opinion however it is no Doubt better as it  is but had the malitia been Calld and they obyed and the fellows in the Brarracks obstinate Can you Say Certainly that the troops at Lanstr, York and the stragling furlowed men or some Disparado woud have taken advantage of the Confusion. Can you say that all these things or any of them woud have happened but when men do thire duty they have nothing to fear.  I am asstonished at your assersion that Congress is the aggressor in the present Dispute with the Soldiers. I am sure when you think Cooly you will think otherwise. Has not Congress done evrything in thire power (Little as that power is) and woud not the Charge lay with more propriety against the States who have with held thier taxs and have Defeated Evry Salutary measure proposed by Congress of Establishing of revenues in order to do Justice to the Soldier and Criditor? Had those fellows a right to Complain many of whom were not more than five months in sarvic they recived 9£ Bounty, a Sute of Cloathes and thire arms, fellows who had never been in action the offscourings and filth of the Earth promted by fellows in Dispared Corcomstances are thus the men who were to Draw Down the Vengence of the armie and the publick Creditors on Congress. Had the armie those Brave men who have fought our Battles acted thus I woud have said that they had reason to be uneasy, but those brave men to thire Everlasting praise let be Said they have Submit altho I belive reluctantly to thire hard fate. Many are the Instants of Kings and publick Bodys reciveing like insults. Those things will happen in well regulated governments and it is sometimes prudent to pass them over in as Easey a mannor as posiable and I believe that Congrass will do so in the present Case. They have no inclanation to Enter into and Dispute with Council or the State on the occasion and I hope that the Council and State will act a prudent and wise part and will Discover a Conciliatating Dissposition and I woud willingly flatter my selfe that in a short time things will Come to rights again, mens tempers will Cool and thire fears Subside and Congrass will strut on the pavements of the grand metroplaiss and talk those Woundefull thing over and Congratulate Each other on the mervolous Esscape we made and the great in wisdom and prudence in Conducting affair to a happey Esue. You wish Congrass to return will you prud[ent] Philadelphians Condesend to invite them to return or will you rather say that they went without our Knowlage and they may return without an invotation. We will not stoop to do it. Some in Congrass Exspect an invotation and I belive woud not hisitate but woud return and it woud be I think a generous act in some of the Citizens to do it and I think Coud not hurt thire pride. Congrass was hasty in moving, prehaps Council was slow or at least some thought So and it is neassarry to do some things at  times when Doing it will have a tendencey to promote the good of the whole and I belive an invotation woud have that happy Effect. I believe that I told you that I Dissaproved the step Congrass had taken and I wish most Sincirely that they woud return. The Delagats of Pennsyvania are in a very Dessagreeable Situation at least I feel so however I think that we Can't long continue at such a Distance from the publick offices and it woud be Very imprudent and almost imposabl to Keep them here. I Shall stay this week and if I find a Dissposition in Congrass to remain longer I shall See you soon but I am at present of opinion that the State ought to be represented and I Coud wish it woud Sute Mr Wilson to attend.

But the Devil has set his Mark upon all this Business. I am clear it was the Intention & Determination of Congress that if General St. Clair chose to take the Command the Door was open & it was moved and agreed to that instead of General Howe, the Commanding General in Pennsilvania(2) should be inserted. But now it seems this is not done. St. Clair is justly hurt by it as he has had an Agency in the Commencement of the Affair & now sees himself excluded. Tho' he would not have sought the Command yet Appearances are now against him. I assured the Malcontents of the City that their own General had the Option to take the Command if he would & therefore no Insult could be JULY 8, 1783  intended on the Citizens.

Every lover of his country expected that e'er now the way would be opened for an honorable return. Congress quitted Philadelphia because they could have no assurance of protection.

  Sir, Princeton, July 10th, 1783. I should have acknowledged the honor of your Excellency's letter of the 23d of June by Jesse Brown, of whom I received it, on his return, but he made no stay here. He will have informed your Excellency of the adjournment of Congress to this place. They were prevented going on with business at Philadelphia by a mutiny in the Pensylvania line, of about 500 men, who had formed there under a board of Sergeants for a redress of grievancies, & taken the command of the City & magazine, & once proceeded so far as, with fixed bayonets, to surround the State house in which Congress & the Council of the State were sitting--threatning destruction if their demands were not complied with in 20 minutes. Some officers of a higher rank, as was then supposed & since appears, were at tbe bottom of the business, two of which are fled. Congress by a Committee, whose report is here- JULY 10, 1783  with inclosed, called on President Dickinson & his Council to turn out their militia & suppress the mutiny; but they had not spirit or power enough to do it, or did not think it necessary. After waiting in this scituation some days, & appearances of menace & further violence still continuing, Congress judged it expedient to adjourn to this place, which they did on the 24th of June. Expecting at the same time, that their removal out of the reach of the mutineers, with its being known that a detachment of eastern troops was ordered from the main army, might, by convincing them they were to expect coercion instead of compliance, disconsert & disperse them. The expectation was in some measure answered. The detachment from the army is notwithstanding gone forward to disarm such of the mutineers as may not have dispersed, & to bring to trial such of the principal actors as can be apprehended; & also to prevent further disorders upon the arrival of the rest of the Pensylvania line from the southward. How long Congress will remain here is uncertain. They will hardly return to Philadelphia without some assurances of protection, or even then with intention to stay longer than till accomodations shall be elsewhere prepared for a fixed residence. But, Sir, it will soon be of very little consequence where Congress go, if they are not made respectable as well as responsible, which can never be done without giving them a power to perform engagements as well as make them. It was indeed intended to have given them this power in the Confederation, by declaring their contracts & requisition for the common defence, sacredly binding on the States; but in practice it amounts to nothing. Most of the States recognize those contracts & comply with the requisitions so far only as suits their particular opinion & convenience; & they are the more disposed at present to go on in this way from the inequalities it has already produced, & a mistaken idea that the danger is over; not duly reflecting on the calamities of a disunion & anarchy, or their rapid approach to such a State. There must, Sir, be a revenue some how established that can be relied on & applied for national purposes as the exigencies arise, independant of the will or views of a single State, or it will be impossible to support national faith or national existance. The powers of Congress should be defined, but their means must be adequate to the purposes of their institutions. It is possible there may be abuses & misapplications--still it is better to hazzard something than to hazzard all. I am glad to be informed, Sir, the two Messrs Huntington will be here soon.(1) Business has been much delayed for the want of a sufficient representation. We hear nothing official concerning the definitive treaty later than by a letter from Doctr Franklin of about the 20th of April.(2) It had been delayd by the tardiness of the Dutch, but more for the want of a british ministry; but was then going on. Mr Hartley, who had succeeded Mr Oswald, was very acceptable, &, as the Doctor adds, an old  JULY 11, 1783  acquaintance of his & a lover of peace. Accounts from New York say that an embarkation of the German troops is taking place & that the treaty is to be expected very soon. The commercial treaty with Sweeden is arrived.(3) Denmark also desires one. The journals requested by your Excellency shall be sent.

  Gentlemen, Princeton 15 July 1783 As Congress have not yet elected any Minister for Foreign Affairs, and knowing the importance of your Being fully informed of every public transaction relative to these States, I have concluded that you would not think it amiss to hear from me on the subject of the removal of Congress to this place, tho' I cannot consider this communication as official but merely for your information in my Individual capacity. The State of our Finances making it indispensably necessary to abridge the public expences in every instance that would not endanger the union, we concluded to reduce the army by discharging all the Soldiers enlisted for the War, with a proportionate number of Officers, on condition that the discharge should operate no otherwise than as a furlough, until the ratification of the Definitive Treaty. This not only eased us of a heavy disbursement of ready Cash for subsistence money and Rations, but gratified many of the army who wished to be at home in the early part of the Summer, to provide for the following Winter. Three months pay was ordered, which could no otherwise be complied with, but by a paper anticipation of the Taxes, payable in six months. By an inevitable accident, the Notes did not arrive at the army till six days after the Soldiers were discharged and had left the camp. This together with some difficulty in settling their accounts, created an uneasiness among the Troops; but by the General's Address and the good conduct of the Officers, they all retired peacably to their different States, tho' without a single farthing of cash to buy themselves a meal of Victuals. In the Barracks in Philadelphia and at Lancaster, in the State of Pennsylvania, there were a number of new Recruits, who had been enlisted since the months of December and January last, and who had not yet taken the field; these Soldiers having not been brought under any regular discipline, made many objections against accepting their discharges and gave their Officers reason to fear some difficulty in getting rid of them, but the Secretary at War thought he had satisfied them by assuring them of the like pay with the rest of the army. On the 15th of June(1) a petition was received from the Serjeants, requiring a Redress of their grievances, in a very turbulent and indecent Style, of which no notice was taken; but on the 18th we received the letters No. 1 and 2.(2) A Committee was immediately appointed to confer with the Executive Council of Pennsylvania, and to endeavour to get them JULY 15. 1783  to call out the Militia to stop the Mutineers; but to no purpose; the Council thinking that the Citizens would not choose to risque themselves when fair means might do. The first Report of the Committee, contained in No. 3(3) will shew their proceedings. On the 19th the troops arrived and joined those at the Barracks in the City, who had been encreased in number by a few companies of old Soldiers arrived the day before from Charles Town. The whole being very orderly and quiet, Congress adjourned on Friday the 20th, as usual, till Monday morning. On the 2lst one of the Committee called on me and informed, that the Soldiers at the Barracks were very disorderly and had cast off the authority of their Officers--that it was suspected they had a design, the following night, against the Bank, and advised me to call Congress without delay. This I did, to meet in half an hour. The Soldiers by accident hearing of it, very fortunately hastened their designs a day or two sooner than was intended. The Members of Congress had just got together, except one, when the State House (in which also The President and Supreme Executive Council were then sitting) was surrounded by about three hundred armed Men with fixed Bayonets under the command of seven Serjeants. Congress immediately sent for Genl. St. Clair and demanded the reason of this hostile appearance, who informed of his having just arrived in Town from his seat in the Country in obedience to the orders of Congress of the day preceding; that he had received information from the Commanding officer of the mutinous disposition of the Troops, who had marched from the Barracks contrary to the orders of their officers; and that the Veteran Troops from Charles Town had been unwillingly forced into the measure. The President of the State then appeared, and produced the insolent paper of which No.4(4) is a copy, which had been sent into him by the Serjeants. Congress determined they would enter on no deliberations while thus surrounded; but ordered Genl. St. Clair immediately to endeavour to march the Mutineers back to the Barracks by such means as were in his power. After several prudent and wise measures, the General prevailed on the Serjeants to return to their Barracks, convincing them that if they were aggrieved they had a right to make it known in a decent manner, thro' any persons they might think proper to appoint. But previous to this, after waiting surrounded by this armed force for near three hours, Congress broke up and we passed thro' the files of the Mutineers without the least opposition, tho' at times before our adjournment, the Soldiers, many of whom were very drunk, threatened Congress by name. The Mutineers had taken possession of the powder House and several public Arsenals in this City, with some Field pieces from the public yard. JULY 15, 1783  In the evening Congress met and made a House and came to the resolutions contained in No. 5(5) and broke up without adjournment. The Committee not being able to meet the Council till Sunday morning were then prevailed on to wait for an answer till monday morning and then received the answer contained in the 2d Report No. 6.(6) However hoping that the Council would change their sentiments, the Comittee did not think proper to give me their advice till Tuesday at two O'Clock in the Afternoon. In the mean time the Mutineers kept in arms, refusing all obedience to their Officers, and in possession of the powder House and Magazines of Military Stores. On Tuesday morning the Officers reported to me that the preceding evening the Serjeants, notwithstanding some talk of a submission and return to their duty, had presented six officers with a commission each as on No. 7;(7) and on one refusing to accept it they threatened him with immediate death--and that, at the time of the Report, they were getting very drunk and in a very riotous state. By the second Report of the Committee you will be acquainted with the particulars of the transaction, with the addition that the behaviour of the six Officers was very mysterious and unaccountable. At two O'Clock agreeably to the advice of the Committee, I summoned Congress to meet at this place on Thursday the 26th of June; issued the Proclamation No. 8(8) and left the City. As soon as it was known that Congress was going, the Council were informed, that there was great reason to expect a serious attack on the Bank the night following, on which the President of the State collected about One hundred Soldiers and kept Guard all night. On Wednesday it was reported that Congress had sent for the Commander in Chief with the whole Northern Army; and the Militia of New-Jersey, who were to be joined by the Pennsylvania Militia, in order to quell the meeting; which was no otherwise true than ordering a detachment of a few hundred men from the North River. The Serjeants being alarmed, soon proposed a submission, and the whole came in a Body to the President of the State, making a most submissive acknowledgement of their misconduct, and charging the whole on two of the Officers, whom they had commissioned to represent their grievances, A Capt. Carbery and Lieutenant Sullivan, who were to have headed them, as soon as they should have proceeded to violences. These Officers immediately escaped to Chester and there got on board of a Vessel bound to London. The Serjeants describe the plan laid by these Officers as of the most irrational and diabolical nature, not only against Congress and the Council, but also against the City and Bank. They were to be joined by straggling parties from different parts of the Country, and after executing their horrid purposes were to have gone off with their plunder to the East Indies. However incredible this may appear the letters No. 9 & l09 from Sullivan to Colo. Moyland, his  Commanding Officer, from Chester and the Capes clearly shew that it was a deep laid scheme. It appears clearly to me that next to the continued care of divine Providence, the miscarriage of this plan is owing to the unexpected meeting of Congress on Saturday, and their decided conduct in leaving the City, until they could support the fOEderal Government with dignity.  It is also said that two of the Citizens have been concerned in this wicked plot, but they are not yet ascertained. They were certainly encouraged by some of the lower class as well as by the general supineness in not quelling the first movement. Some very suspicious circumstances attending the conduct of the other four Officers, who were commissioned by the Serjeants have caused them to be arrested. The whole matter has so far subsided. The detachment under Genl. Howe from the Northern Army has arrived in the vicinity of the City and a Court of enquiry is endeavouring to develope the whole affair. The Citizens are greatly chagrined at the predicament in which they stand and endeavour to lay the blame on the Council for not calling on them and proving them, while the Council justify themselves by the advice of the Militia officers, whom they called together for that purpose. The Citizens are universally petitioning Congress to return to the City, assuring us of their constant protection. You will excuse me for tiring you with so circumstantial an account, which nothing but the necessity of preventing the many falsehoods that are generally propagated on these occasions and the propriety of your being well informed, would ever have justified me in. I do myself the honor to send herewith the Newspapers, and particularly a Circular Letter of Genl. Washington to the different States,10 which in my opinion gives the finishing stroke to his inimitable Character. I have committed this letter to the care of my younger Brother, who is bound for London, having been in the Merchant service at that port for several years, but who, I have the best evidence is well attached to the interests of this Country, and who can inform you of many particulars relating to the State of things here.

  Dear Sir, Princeton July 15, 1783 I recieved your Letter of the 1st inst. I will procure a Search to be made for the Papers(1) in the Secretary's Office as I was sure of there being there but was always told the contrary. I am so much used to such Accounts of the Backwardness of the States to comply with confederal Plans of Finance that I am not surprized at the Intelligence you are pleased to communicate. Some  JULY 15, 1783  great Calamity must happen before we get right. What this will be must be left to Time & Chance which seem to regulate the Affairs of Mankind as much in our Days as in those of Solomon. You are right in your Conjectures that Congress are distressed beyond Measure for Want of Money. I am the more disstressed because I see little Prospect that the States will be inclined to establish any Plan by which they will ever have any. Each State thinks it has done the most. Each endeavours by Refusals of general Plans to obtain what they think is particular Justice in its own Case. It is presumed that by holding their Hands they can produce a Necessity in Congress of meeting their particular Wishes. But this Point will be pushed I fear 'till the Band is broken & then we shall be at Sea again. It is most assuredly just that something ought to be done for the Relief of those States who have been compelled to make large Advances on Account of their particular Exposure to the Enemy. I am sure this is so reasonable that it must be done one Day or other. But in the mean Time why should our national Faith be suffered to expire and the Individuals to whom the Union are Debtors be reduced to the Extremities of Distress? Would it not be odd that if 13 private persons should enter into a Partnership & become largely indebted that they should refuse their Creditors Payment because the Partners differed with one another about the Accounts of the Partnership? I wish the greater States would have the Magnanimity to be the first in their Exertions to strengthen the Union because then the little ones would be obliged to strike in for their own Security; For what is to keep the great States from destroying the lesser ones but a strong federal Constitution? I write to you thus freely because I know you have liberal Opinions on the Subject & I am sure that I have Nothing more at Heart than that we should be forever united on the solid Principles of general Advantage & that Justice & Good Faith should be the leading Features in our System. I can speak without Biass on this Subject for it will injure me very little if the public never pay me a Farthing of what small Part of my Property they have in their Hands. But we shall be despised abroad & convulsed at Home if something is not speedily done to support our tottering Union. Distractions will prevail among us & we shall fall a Prey either to domestic Ambition or foreign Invasion. But I hope the good Sense of the People will avert these Evils finally & if in the mean Time Providence permits us to undergo some Chastisements we should not complain because it was in our Power to have prevented them. I am with very sincere Esteem, your obedt Servant, Richard Peters ""

  Princetown 16th July 1783  I informed, my dear Jack, of the situation of my heart before I left Philadelphia, and that your sister seemed disposed to favor my hopes. It is necessary that I should conceal nothing from you. Our interviews after this served but to increase my affection, and convince me that if I could not be happy with her I could be happy with no other woman. There is a charm in her reserved sensibility more pleasing than even beauty itself, while the delicacy and justness of her sense gives new force to her personal attractions. I now see before me a sure prospect of rest, and of uncommon felicity in the tenderest connection. And what hightens my hopes on the occasion, and, endears her to me the more, is, that she has not been biassed in her choice by either friends or relations. Congratulate me, embrace me, and anticipate with me, the day that will permit me to add to the cordial name of friend, the affectionate epithet of brother. My Jack, I am at this instant happy, and I trust that neither my present or future happiness will tend to diminish a friendship which has been growing more interesting even since our early acquaintance. I will offer no excuse for making you the medium of the inclosed letter.(1) Nor will you think it improper in your sister to write to one who has pledged himself never to be anothers. When you are as much in love as I am, and are loved in your turn, you will find a pleasure in writing to your mistress and in receiving from her a letter which till then you cannot experience, and which I cannot describe, but which I mention to induce you to facilitate a measure so essential to lighten the heavy hours of absence. One thing more. I do not trust this letter to the Stage-box, and I wish you to use a similar precaution as it would hurt your sisters feelings should any accident happen to our correspondence.

July 16 1783 The lucky arrival of our brother Lee who is gone on to Princeton has relieved me from the necessity of obeying your summons by Mr. Hawkins.(1) You will not therefore expect any Congressional news by this conveyance.  A letter by the post from Mr. Ambler repeats his request that warrants in form may be sent by all the Delegates for the amount of their respective shares of his remittances. He adds that two bills one for £500, the other for upwards of £600 Va.

  Dear Sir, Princeton 17th July 1783  I had the honor of receiving your Excellency's favour relative to the promotions in General Hazen's Regiment,(1) which was referred to the Secretary at War to report. The Assistant Secretary has accordingly reported,(2) that there is no record of any such promotions in his Office. I informed Congress how the matter stood, but they chose to have an official report from the Secretary. The fact is that some time last April Genl. Hazen brought a number of Commissions promoting the Officers of his Regiment for me to sign; but finding a Report of a Committee of some Months' standing relative to the reduction of this Regiment, and that it had been referred to the Secretary at War to report and was then under consideration, I did not choose to sign them without mentioning the matter in Congress. This I did and was directed by Congress not to sign them till further orders. A Committee was then appointed to consider this matter, who conferred, I believe, with Genl. Hazen and reported, and it is now under consideration. I mentioned this matter to General Hazen in April and assigned the order of Congress as the reason for my not signing them. The Commissions yet remain with me. I also received and laid before Congress your Excellency's favour relative to the Commissioners in New York.(3) Yesterday Congress came to the Resolution, a copy whereof is enclosed(4)--But failing to make a House this morning by the sickness of one of the Members, it could not be read the second time so as to be compleat.

  Dear sir. Princeton, State of New Jersey 17th July 1783. I have been favor'd with your attention of the 25th ultimo.  While Congress are recommendg. & the states deliberating, I fear our national character will greatly suffer, & the public creditors remain unpaid.  The delegates from Mastts. have been informed by the Court of the situation of the soldiers that have returnd. to our state, and they have procured an inquiry to be made of the financier respecting the same.  The Constitution as well as the confederation must be carefully attended to, or I perceive we shall soon be in great difficulties, as a people. I am sorry to hear the Governor is unwell; the accounts you are pleased to mention should have been settled long since; & I make no doubt but you have discharged your duty.  Our worthy friend Dr. Witherspoon got home safe, & has made me a visit, & informd. me of your welfare.

I understand there is an address to Congress signing by the citizens of Philada. requesting their return but what an effect it will have is uncertain; the people of New Jersey take great pains to make the situation of Congress agreeable.

It will always give me pleasure to communicate information to you, respecting our national affairs, but I consider it unnecessary, at this time, to comply with your request, respecting our public debt, on the state of our Finances, as I have lately been favored with the perusal of a letter from you to my Colleague,(1) wherein you acknowledge the receipt of a pamphlet which contains a particular account of our national debt, & a Genl state of our finances,(2) to which I must beg leave to refer you, & shall make no observations upon them, as they speak themselves.  It is not for me to say, \""what is to become of old continental\""; much time has been taken up [on] this matter & it now lays before Congress as the order of the day, but can't be acted upon 'till nine states are represented in Congress; there has not been that number present for a length of time, which causes great delay of public business; the committee that had it under consideration reported that it should be redeemed at 75 for one, but that was not agreed to by Congress, and I consider it very uncertain what will be their next resolution upon this subject, but you may be assured that the delegates from Masstts. are not inattentive to the same. It gives one concern to hear that bread corn is so dear with you it is plenty in Philadelphia & the crops very fine.  I am sorry to find that the good people are determining at this time about the Refugees & Absentees, as Congress no doubt, will make the definitive treaty the rule of their conduct, & I agree with you, respecting numbers that have left us.  I expect that before this comes to hand you will have heard of the removal of Congress from Philada. to Princeton, for a more particular account of this matter, I must ask leave to refer you to the inclosed newspaper where you will find the report of a committee of Congress upon the subject, & Congress have ordered it to be entered upon their Journals; I assure you sir, our situation was disagreeable, for some reasons, while we were surrounded by about 300 armed men, and guards placed at our doors, & from every appearance the soldiers seem'd to be prepared for the worst purposes. Congress sit in the College in this place and are much better accommodated than I expected, & the people take great pains to make our situation agreeable; Congress have assigned a day in Octr. next to determine upon the place of their permanent abode; some of the states, namely, Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, & New York, have made great offers to Congress to settle with them & the several states JULY 17, 1783  are apprised of the same that they may instruct their members if they think proper.

  Dear Sir Philada. July 17th. 1783. Your two favors of the 1 & 17 of June, with the debates of Congress, the letter for Miss Floyd and the Cyphers inclosed in the former, and your amendments to the Constitution inclosed in the latter, have been duly recd. The latter came by yesterday's mail.(1) I feel too sensibly the value of these communications to omit my particular acknowledgments for them. The usual reserve of our Ministers has kept us in entire suspence since my last with regard to the definitive Treaty and every thing else in Europe. The only incident produced in this interval has been that which removed Congress from this City to Princeton. I have selected the Newspaper which contains the Report of a Committee on that subject, from which you will collect the material information. Soon after the removal of Congs. the Mutineers surrendered their arms and impeached some of their officers, the two principal of whom have escaped to Sea. Genl. Howe with a detachment of Eastern troops is here and is instituting an enquiry into the whole plot, the object & scheme of which are as yet both involved in darkness. The Citizens of this place seem to disavow the alledged indisposition to exert force agst. insults offered to Congress, and are uniting in an address rehearsing the proofs which they [have] given of attachment to the fOEderal authority, professing a continuance of that attachment, and declaring the utmost readiness on every occasion, to support the dignity and privileges of Congs. if they sd. deem this place the fittest for transacting the public business until their permanent residence shall be fixed.(2) What effect this address backed by the scanty accomodations of JULY 17, 1783  Princeton will have on Congress is uncertain. The prevailing disposition seemed to be that a return to their former residence as soon as the way sd. be decently opened would be prudent in order to prevent any inferences abroad of disaffection in the mass of so important a State to the revolution or the fOEderal governmt. Others suppose that a freer choice among the Seats offered to Congress could be made here than in a place where the necessity of a speedy removal wd. give an undue advantage to the seat happening to be in greatest readiness to receive them. The Advocates for Anapolis appear to be sensible of the force of this consideration, and probably will if they can, detain Congs. in Princeton until a final choice be made. N. Jersey will probably be tempted to concur in the plan by the advantage expected from actual possession.(3) Other Members are extremely averse to a return to Philada. for various reasons.  I have been here during the week past engaged partly in some writing which, my papers being all here cd. not be so well done elsewhere, partly in some preparations for leaving Congress. The time of my setting out depends on some circumstances which in point of time are contingent. Mr. Lee arrived here two days ago and proceeds to day to Princeton. Mr. Mercer is gone to the Sea-board in N. Jersey for his health.(4) I shall probably return to Princeton next week, or sooner if I sd. have notice of any subject of consequence being taken up by Congress. Subjects of consequence, particularly a ratification of the Treaty with Sweeden have been long waiting on their table for 9 states.(5)  I am Dr. Sir Yr. sincere friend J Madison Jr. ""

  My dear sir.(1) Princetown 19 July 1783  How could you suppose that I had forgot you; but you must have been convinced, and have repented of the thought almost as soon as formed, or else my letter to you has miscarried. You have conjectured right; I have been very busy ever since the first day on which I crossed the threshold of Congress; and not the less so in consequence of being without a colleague. I have not however negle[c]ted paying a little court, to a little lady,(2) that you will not be displeased with when you see JULY 19, 1783  and that I do not hate. This it is probable will operate against the increased attentions you recommend, unless the encreased charms of the fair one you discribe, should shake my fealty to the one I conceal. Now will you swear that I am in love; and swear that I am going to desert the order [of] batchelorhood, which I have acquired with so much honor and so few scars; and swear that it is criminal in me to marry out of Maryland; nay perhaps, swear for there is no saying where a man will stop swearing who enters heartily into it--that I should not marry at all--not one word of which shall I contradict were it only for the pleasure I sometimes take in pu[rsuing] whom I love.  To-day is an idle day being Saturday, besides several of our gentlemen having gone to Philada. we could have no Congress were we even inclined to hold one. No doubt you hear many sarcasms on our removal. It was said by a wag the other day that Congress at Princetown were like fish out of water, they could only live in Philadelphia. They might be more aptly compared, said another, taking him up short, to the whale, that every now and then is obliged to rise to the surface of the water; as Congress men go to Philadelphia, in order to suck in fresh air and spout a little. Notwithstanding such jokes I can assure you that the atmosphere of this place is very wholesome; but then some persons think it extremely distressing not to be suffocated with the smoke of four or five thousand chimnies and the dust raised by nearly as many thousand carts and carriages. Besides we have here an excellent concert on every tree, which one can enjoy without going to the door; but this is likewise thought a poor substitute for the bells that are incessantly tolling to bury the dead. The want of asiatic dinners is another grievous complaint, and not to be compensated by the hospitable tables of plain healthy farmers, who placed at a distance from two large cities are as yet exempt from the [corr]uptions of either. For my own part, I am [ver]y well satisfied with the good lamb, mutton, beef, fouls, hams, beans and cabbages which the country affords in great plenty. But there is another reason for my being pleased. I lodge about a mile from Princetown at a Mr Taylors where there happens to be on a visit a very pretty quaker lady, who makes tolerable verse this verse-making quality is added--bashfulness--youth--innocence--good sense--and good nature. You will think perhaps the people of the house as innocent as their visitor, inasmuch as they have taken the Lock off her room door and put it upon mine; although I cannot open mine without almost touching hers. But, sweet innocent! thou art not less safe than if thy door was bolted by iron bars of adamant and guarded by a dragon. Sleep therefore in peace and tranquil be thy slumber--for hadst thou no protector in thine own virtue--thou wouldst find one in my honor. I hope this letter will convince you--that I have not taken much pains to write it--that I cannot tell you the price of cloth in Philad.--  that no definitive treaty has arrived--and the late mutiny of the troops--that there is no money in the treasury--and the proceedings of Congress with the executive of Pennsylvania--that they did right in moving from Philadelphia--And the offer of Virginia of Williamsburg for their residence and £100,000 to build hotels3--that it w[ill] be difficult to get them to Annapolis--and finally that there is not in the possession of Congress any news with which I could entertain a friend. Till therefore some occurs adieu, and beleive me sincerely yours, James McHenry  ""

  July 21st [1783]. Massachusetts appears to be in a great fermentation. Parties run very high there, and violent measures are pursuing. The French Interest is united with the Governor. Judge Sullivan is their Leader, and 'tis well known to You that he will be stopp'd by no principle or consideration. The Commutation with the army, and the Refugee Articles in the Treaty are made use of to inflame the people. And it must be allowed the Instruments are well chosen, as no others could be used with equal Success.  The Chevalier had the first notice here of the New Delegation,(1) and discovers the highest Satisfaction with it, indeed he had no small share in producing it. He found it necessary to remove the men who thwarted his Designs. The same parties are united against J. Adams, and intend to run him down as soon as he arrives. Great Efforts are making to render him unpopular and the peace reprobated. The French have two points in view, to weaken us by internal Dissentions, and to prevent such a Conciliation with the British as may be the Ground of any future useful Connection with them. In all this their JULY 21, 1783  Conduct is natural, and (for the Disciples of Machiavel) perfectly right. In pursuing their own Interest they must keep us as dependent as possible, and prevent as far as possible a harmony with Britain. But how are We to conduct who know all this? and what shall we say to those among us who, to serve some private Ends, are leaguing with Foreigners against the Peace and Happiness of their Country? However, I have strong hopes that, being flush'd by their late Successes, they will be encouraged to take such large Strides as will alarm the people, and enable them to distinguish betwixt their Friends and their Foes. Under these Circumstances, I am loth to quit my Station, tho' solicited to it by every thing that is near to me. I should have been very happy to have seen a British Envoy here of good Character and Abilities before I returned, to have possessed him of the true State of Politics, and the Charactors of the Actors on the political Stage. It appears to me very important to them and to us that one shou'd be here to counteract the French, who have now an exclusive Field. The latter have their Agents in all the large States, and thro' them have a great Influence even in our Assemblies. The Interest of America and Britain are so clearly one in my mind, that their joint Efforts should be exerted in opposition to the French. Without this, there is great Danger that, thro' the medium of unprincipled Individuals in the States, the Interest of America and Britain will be highly injured. I should not therefore hesitate at taking an active part in concert with them, so far as our Interest and theirs should coincide.(2)  ""

As Mr. Robert Morris's undue & wicked influence depends so much upon the residence here, it is presumd that he will use his utmost authority for that purpose. But his influence has manifestly diminished since the removal from Philadelphia, & the fixing of Congress in any other place will I hope restrain it within due bounds. It is much suspected that he & his friends have been the prime movers of all the disturbances in the Army, for the purpose of enforcing the 5 per Ct. in the shape most parental of a corrupt influence in Congress of which he with reason expected to be the prime Minister. Naturally, I conceive, the Soldiers, had they not been otherwise tutord, woud have made their attempt upon him, as it is notorious that all the funds of the U.S. are in his hands.  Potomac & Delaware are the Competitors for the permanent residence of Congress. The offer of jurisdiction in two States, is, in reason, a very strong circumstance in favor of Potomac.1 But unhappily reason very rarely governs in these decisions.

Mr. Laurens will probably be here soon, when it is to be hoped that our State will be constantly represented, which can not now be reasonably expected, as we have only four Members in this part of the World.(3) Mr. Quarrier has an old One horse Chaise of mine at his Shop, which I would be glad to exchange for a good second hand Sulky; or for a new one if he does not ask too much to boot. If you have leisure, or if you have occasion to walk as far as Quarrier's I should be obliged to you JULY 22, 1783  if you would consult him on this subject. I am with great regard, Dr. Sr., your most obt. Servt. Ra. Izard ""

  Princeton, July 23d. 1783  It happens My Dear Sir that both Mr. Maddison and myself are here. We have talked over the subject of your letter to him, and need not assure you how happy we should both be to promote your wish; but the representation continues so thin, that we should have little hope that any thing which is out of the ordinary course and has somewhat of novelty in it could go through. We therefore have concluded it would be to no purpose to make the experiment in the present state of things; but shall sound towards a more full representation; though we fear the strictness of the ideas of many Gentlemen will be a bar to the success of the measure. You shall hear from me further on the subject.(1) Mr. Maddison does not write himself as this letter contains both our ideas but he presents his compliments and the assurances of his esteem.  The future destination of Congress cannot now be ascertained. There is an address signing from the citizens of Philadelphia amounting to an invitation to return. Many are of opinion on conciliatory principles, that it will be prudent to do it, till the question respecting permanent residence is decided. Others are much disinclined to a return from different motives. We have nothing new except an annunciation from Mr. Rivington in a letter to Mr. Izard of the arrival of the definitive treaty. He adds that New York was by the treaty to have been evacuated the 21st of this month. When we are more enlightened I will write you details or rather I will bring them.

I should be very sorry to send the Bill back protested, as I am sure it would have a bad effect; at the same time I do not think myself authorized to receive anything but money in payment of the Bill. Col. Pinckney desires me to send him a pair of Bay Horses not exceeding five years old, & has limited me to 308 Dollars. The passage, & other expences he will pay in Charles Town. He desires me to apply to Hiltzeimer if I should not be able to purchase the Horses myself. It is very probable that Mr. Morris's Notes may be as acceptable to Hiltzeimer, as money; I should be obliged to you if you would take the trouble of consulting him, & if the Horses can be procured that they may be shipped for Charles Town, & that you would write a Letter to Colonel Pinckney, informing him of it. I am obliged to Mr. Morris for the trouble he has taken about my New London Bill, & for his offer to pay me the amount of it. I can not however conceive a good reason why Mr. Morris's Correspondent has not given him an account of the fate of the Bill.

  My Lord, Philadelphia, July 23d, 1783. Among the blessings of peace I number that of being able to renew my correspondence with a nobleman I so much respect and esteem. For that peace, honourable to America, and as much so in my judgment for England as the actual situation of things could give any colour of reason to expect, your country and America are indebted to your lordship's wisdom and firmness.  Upon my word, my lord, did I not know so much of the politics of St. James' and St. Stephens', I should be lost in wonder at the vote in the house of commons and the treatment your lordship has received.(1) But I shall never forget Lord Chatham's expression, 'I was duped and deceived.' The outrageous wickedness of visiting upon your conclusion of the war, the evils which the folly of its commencement, and the rapacity, cruelty and profusion of the conduct of it produced, sprung from the same source with the deception practised upon Lord Chatham, which he so emphatically detailed in the house of peers. I always judged that the author of those measures, who cannot be said to cover himself with the majesty of darkness, though he meant the subjugation of America, would in fact conduct her to independence. I judged, too, that he would in the end, bring himself to ruin. Nothing, surely, can more accelerate this event, than introducing again into high office the ostensible minister of those pernicious measures. For as to his whig colleagues, their reign is short; and their fall will assuredly be unpitied.  Of the people of England, on whom in fact the salvation of their country depends, it may he said, that \""aliquando redit in prcordia virtus.\""(2) They have given some proofs of this; and perhaps the last one will bring due punishment upon the author of their near approach to humiliation and ruin; an humiliation and ruin which, had not your lordship interposed, would at this moment have been consummated. I have flattered myself that your lordship has felt some anxiety about my situation, under the various attacks that have been made upon me. They all originated with the minister,(3) whose politics so much overshot themselves in the late negotiation for peace, and who was determined on my removal, as one who could not be bent to his purposes. He found, however, my successor(4) stubborn; and this country owes immortal gratitude to that gentleman's firmness, spirit and integrity. Yet an attempt was made to sacrifice him, for this very serv-ice; and I had the pleasure of defending him against those men, with whom he cooperated in effecting my removal. I am now elected into congress, for the third and last year I am capable of sitting there, by the confederation. I shall then retire into private life, with the satisfac- JULY 23, 1783  tion of dwelling under that constitution which I have laboured to assist in rearing to liberty, virtue and public happiness.  But I am afraid politicians have been too sanguine in their expectations from systems of government. Corruption and intrigue seem inseparable from them all; and these are promoted or restrained more by the genius of the people, than by forms of government, or the operation of laws. Indeed it does not seem so unwise now, as it once did, in Mr. Pope, to say, \""For forms of government let fools contest; That which is best administer'd, is best.\""(5) Nor would I promise that a little more experience will not make me a convert to his opinions.  You used to say, my lord, that you would send Lord Fitzmaurice to make the tour of America. Such a tour, I conceive, would be both interesting and instructive. Nature has displayed her powers in the sublime and beautiful far more in America than in Europe, and the progress of art, considering the time it has had to operate, is astonishing. I shall next year be at liberty to accompany Lord Fitzmaurice in such a tour, and should take a vast deal of pleasure in doing it.  I have the honour to be, with profound respect and regard, your obedient servant, Arthur Lee.(6) MS not found; reprinted from Richard Henry Lee, Life of Arthur Lee, LL.D., 2 vols.

  Dear Sir, P Town July 25' 1783  Your favour of 21st Instt.(1) Came safe to hand previous to the rect. of the address you refer to therein.(2) It is matter of surprize to me and indeed to every thinking honest Man here, that the Citizens of Philadelphia should be so blinded by local Prejudices as \""still to Complain of our sudden departure & long delay from that City.\"" Who were the Cause of that departure? and why is it denominated Sudden? Were not the dignity & Interests of the united States sufficiently committed, by waiting in the most humiliating Situation from Thursday to Tuesday in the next week! For my own Part, I think our departure was indolent & slow, and the last 25 Hours, we staid very certainly at the risque of the Committee's Reputation. But the address is supposed calculated to have appeased Congress. I have seen & read it since the Rect of your Favour--but I suspect you have not taken that Trouble! Congress want not to be appeased, having neither wrath, Bitterness or revengeful disposition on this Subject. They appear to me Calm, deliberate & even rather silent on this Business. The Address that is recd contains a State of Facts that do not relate to the subject of your Letter, much JULY 25, 1783  more than they do to the declaration of Independence. It is signed by about 860 Citizens, out of about 6 or 8000 and we are told that it has been publickly declared at the Coffee House that 5 to one could be obtained to sign an address to keep Congress out of the City. If there was any thing in Congress to be appeased, is this calculated to do it! Altho' I assure you these unofficial Tales are not regarded by Congress as a Body, tho they may affect an Individual or two. But however these are only possible answers to your Queries. I confess I have so little Inclination to give cause of Jealousy to Pennsylvania, for I make a great distinction, between the City & the State, that I am content even to improve this address, by giving my Voice to return to the City till October--but as we have but 7 States, we must be unanimous to accomplish this End, which is not a very likely Circumstance.  You ask why we did not return under a wing of our army. Did we choose to force a Place of Residence, this would be a very natural Question, but as we are not yet in so unhappy a predicament, a good Reason for this Conduct is very obvious. We Claim neither Sovereignty or Jurisdiction over any State or City in the union, that is not clearly granted by the Confederation--this gives no Right or Jurisdiction of our own, over one City or territory more than another, and as to the Factions that are combined agt our Measures, that demands the attention of the union. If our Measures are dictated by Wisdom & the real good of the whole who are to be the dupes & Sacrifices of those Factions but the People themselves whose Servants we are, and therefore their good Sense & Virtue should be exercised to prevent the wickedness of factious Individuals. But your most important observation is, \""that we trifle with the affections & attachments of Pensylv. to the union.\"" If you mean by the union, the Persons & Interests of Congress as a Body, I answer that, we have never had any reason to doubt of the affection or Attachment of Pennsylvania to the Person & Interests of Congress even separately considered, but do you suppose that Congress can consider the Affection or attachment of the Citizens of Philadelphia towards Congress as existing when they reflect on their being made Prisoner by a sett of lawless Banditti for upwards of three Hours in the Midst of a large City, & not a single Citizen out of so many Thousands, ever appeared to offer even the Sanction of their Presence to encourage Suppression of the Insurrection.  I am much obliged to you for your concern for my Honor especially as you think that in the opinion of the Citizens, I share so largely in the Obloquy that has been thrown on Congress. I have said in the Opinion of the Citizens--because was I deserving of the obloquy as being particularly active in the Business, It has so evidently recd the full approbation of the Citizens of almost every State in the union, that it must certainly counterbalan[ce] the obloquy of one City, for however important the City of Philadelphia is in the union it cannot  be put into the Scale agt every other part of 13 States--but your Citizens do me an honor I am not entitled to. I had not even a Voice in the removal of Congress from the City, tho' I assure you it met my most hearty Approbation, and since our removal here, on the most candid & impartial Consideration, I never was more satisfied with any measure Congress have taken. It was done without Passion--with Consideration & unanimously, not excepting the State of Pennsylvania, whose bare negative would have prevented the Measure. We conceive the matter to lye in a narrow compass. The Council had a Right most certainly to refuse the aid asked for, if they thought proper, and Congress had as certainly a Right on such Refusal to remove to such other Place of Residence, as should appear to them more likely to concur in Sentiment with them and to assign the Reason for their Conduct. The Proclamation I am told gives particular offence--for this I am certainly alone Answerable--but this Charge is an additional Evidence of local prejudices, warping the good Sense of the Objectors. Can any Man in his Senses suppose that such a Body as Congress was to be privately adjourned from one State to another, as if no Body had any Business with them, but a few individuals who could be privately notified? Pray what would the Minister & Servants of foreign Powers have said--what would the Officers of Congress & the daily applicants that attend on Business of Importance have said? What would the several States, with the Contractors, the public Creditors & Correspondents of Congress have said, if they had meanly & privately slipped off or escaped by Flight, as some of your Citizens have even now thought proper to term it, without announcing to the world in an open public Manner to what Place they had adjourned? Who was to inform the Citizens of the united States & Foreigners having Business with Congress, where they were to be found? How indeed the infamous advertisement offering a Reward to take up the Congress of the united States that appeared in your City, might have been Justified? Is one of the assemblies of a State called together or adjourned by the Executive of a State, or even a special Court held in a City or County, without being anounced to the Public either by Proclamation or something equal to it, and is the Sovereign Power of the united States, so sunk in the opinion of the Citizens of Philadelphia, that they should suppose them capable of skulking from Place to Place as if they were ashamed to let their removal be known? But it is the Language of the Proclamation that gives Offense. This I am not answerable for. It is but a bare Recital of the Acts & Language of Congress, and I think entirely unexceptionable, as it is setting Forth the Facts as they happened. Congress appear to me to have no Dispute with the State of Pennsylvania. She has exerted herself greatly & in a most respectable Manner in the Comon Cause, and she does now & will still continue to reap the advantage of it as much as & even more than any  State in the Union. Congress have recd many Instances of attention from her and she has been richly repaid in return. Congress & her attendants have for some Years past spent near £150,000 Per Annum in ready money in your City. This is no small Matter--but surely had we only represented the union without any farther advantage to the State, we certainly were entitled to protection from Insult. But what gives one the greatest Satisfaction on this subject is that we are now fully assured that the destruction of private property, if not the City itself was the Object of this Mutiny, and that it was prevented from taking effect by our leaving the City in the manner we did, we are all well convinced of. The private Letters from Sullivan & Carbarer we have in possession are satisfactory on this Subject to every unprejudiced Mind. On the whole, I thought proper as an individual to give you my private Sentiments on this Transaction, tho I wished to be as silent as possible--but as it is designed for your private Consideration & not to increase any ill will that may have already have taken Place in any uninformed Mind I thought it could give no Offence. As the Time of our framing our permanent residence is so near, I could wish to return & settle matters with order & decorum before we make that determination, but as I before observed the thinness of Congress, I am afraid will altogether prevent it.(3) ""

Though I have not performed my promise of writing to you, which I made you when you left this country, yet I have not the less interested myself in your welfare and success. I have been witness with pleasure to every event which has had a tendency to advance you in the esteem of your country; and I may assure you with sincerity, that it is as high as you could possibly wish. All have united in the warmest approbation of your conduct. I cannot forbear telling you this, because my situation has given me access to the truth, and I gratify my friendship for you in communicating what cannot fail to gratify your sensibility.  The peace which exceeds in the goodness of its terms, the expectations of the most sanguine does the highest honor to those who made it. It is the more agreeable, as the time was come, when thinking men began to be seriously alarmed at the internal embarrassments and ex- JULY 25, 1783  hausted state of this country. The New England people talk of making you an annual fish-offering as an acknowlegement of your exertions for the participation of the fisheries.  We have now happily concluded the great work of independence, but much remains to be done to reap the fruits of it. Our prospects are not flattering. Every day proves the inefficacy of the present confederation, yet the common danger being removed, we are receding instead of advancing in a disposition to amend its defects. The road to popularity in each state is to inspire jealousies of the power of Congress, though nothing can be more apparent than that they have no power; and that for the want of it, the resources of the country during the war could not be drawn out, and we at this moment experience all the mischiefs of a bankrupt and ruined credit. It is to be hoped that when prejudice and folly have run themselves out of breath we may return to reason and correct our errors.  After having served in the field during the war, I have been making a short apprenticeship in Congress; but the evacuation of New York approaching, I am preparing to take leave of public life to enter into the practice of the law. Your country will continue to demand your services abroad.  The bearer of this is Mr. Carter, who with Mrs. Carter are making a jaunt to Europe.

  Dear Hannah, Friday July 25. 1783  I informed you in my last that the Address arrived on Wednesday and was referred to a committee. Yesterday only six states attended so that nothing could be done and it is a doubt with me whether there will be states enough to day to form a Congress for business. Mrs. Morgan and her brother came up in the stage yesterday. The weather was so extremely hot that the passengers suffered greatly. Some of the  JULY 25, 1783  horses dropped down & died & the rest came in excessively jaded. It was the same with the stages from Elizabeth town, which were obliged to leave the passengers on the road, some of whom walked into this town through the broiling sun & fresh horses were sent to bring in others. I think I never felt such a night and day as yesterday and the night before. Last Evening a fine breeze sprung up which continues this morning and is very refreshing. I hope you take care of your health. I forgot to tell you that there are 873 names to the address sent up. That with Reed's emendations is not sent up.(1) What an ill fated wretch he is! He might have made some advantage of this business and if he could not have raised himself he might have gratified his infernal malice by depressing his enemy had he joined heartily in the address. But his fondness of being at the head of a party will leave him just as this affair found him: hated, despised and contemptible. Not a line have we from Council. I shall be much mistaken if the Observation of the Wise man will not be verified in some of them, that pride goeth before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall. What the Conduct of Congress will be I cannot yet divine. Many of the members are heartily tired of this place and wish earnestly to remove. Yesterday they complained bitterly of being almost stewed and suffocated the night before in their small rooms. Duane seems averse to return. If he has any hopes of Congress fixing their residence in the state of NY, as he knows that will be agreeable to his state, he will sacrifice every considaration to gain popularity. It is a mortifying consideration that private and not public views too frequently influence the conduct of men at the helm of government. The common danger which has hitherto held these states together being now removed, I see local prejudices, passions and views already beginning to operate with all their force. And I confess I have my fears, that the predictions of our enemies will be found true, that on the removal of common danger our Confederacy & Union will be a rope of sand. There must & will undoubtedly be, for the sake of security, some confederation of states: But how many of the states will be comprehended in a Confederacy or how many confederacys there will be is yet uncertain. Were I to hazard a conjecture it would be that the four eastern states will form one confederacy. Their manners, customs and governments are very similar And they are an unmixed people, being all sprung from a common stock without any great accession of strangers or foreigners. New Y will be compelled to join this confederacy either voluntarily or by force not from any of the causes aforementioned; But because the eastern states will not think themselves secure if Hudson's river & the northern lakes, which are the keys of the country, are kept by a people independent of and seperated from them. For this purpose the state of Vermont, which has hitherto given NY some trouble, will be supported & encouraged & kept as a rod over the head of N Y & if   necessary used to chastise & compel it into the eastern Confederacy. New Jersey, Pensylvania, Delaware and Maryland will form another Union. They are all states whose boundaries are fixed and confined and who have one common strong desire to possess a share of the great Western territory, which they now claim as their right and as an acquisition which the present confederacy has obtained by the expense of their blood and treasure.  The haughtiness of Virginia, its great extent and its boundless claims will induce it to set up for itself. And if ever royal government is set up in N. America, here it will first erect its throne. Her first quarrel will be with the middle confederacy about the western Country. Unless perhaps the people beyond the Allegheny Mountains should be induced first to set up for themselves and to claim an exclusive right to that country. In that case Virginia may attempt to subjugate them & the middle confederacy will support them against her. She may then attempt to form an alliance with the Eastern confederacy or the three Southern states which it is not improbable may league together but without any close confederacy.

No definitive treaty--but daily expected--Congress still in Princetown, but daily expected to return to Philadelphia--by its citizens. Several engines ready to go to work--for this purpose--but some philosophers suspect that they are constructed on false principles.  I have had no opportunity to speak to the minister of France--but I would suppose that his letter must have got to hand by this time. The derangements produced in public offices by our removal to this place has put it out of my power to obtain the late journals of Congress for the use of the State.

And Whereas a Continuance under present Circumstances in the Place of their present Session may have a Tendency to give great Uneasiness to the Government & Citizens of Pennsilvania who altho' they cannot claim any Preference in the Residence of Congress yet would be unhappy & discontented under the Appearance of Resentment which they would suppose to be evidenced by a Permanent Continuance out of that State under a Resolution produced by temporary Inconveniencies & dictated by Events so sudden in their Rise & so short in their Duration that well digested Plans or deliberate Measures may not be presumed to be grounded upon them.  And Whereas the further Absence of Congress from the said City may be supposed to shew by Facts, contradictory to any verbal Assurances, that they had not Confidence in the good Disposition of the Citizens thereof, notwithstanding the said Citizens have recently presented to Congress a most respectful and affectionate Address,(2) wherein they have given solemn Assurances \""that Congress may repose the utmost Confidence in its Inhabitants not only to prevent any Circumstances which may have a Tendency to disturb their necessary Deliberations but to aid in all Measures to support the national Honour and Dignity.\""  And Whereas it is declared to have been the Motive with the Delegates of Pennsilvania to consent to the Removal that the same was not understood to be intended for a longer Period than should be necessary for restoring Quiet & Good Order among the Soldiery & it would be taking an undue Advantage of the said Delegates & of Consequence be derogatory to the Honour & Dignity of Congress should they now after the Causes & Reasons of their Removal are at an End neglect or refuse to return to the City of Philada. there to reside until the Place of their permanent Residence shall be determined upon. And Whereas the Continuance out of that State may induce a Necessity on the Part of the Legislature of Pennsilvania to enquire into  the Causes thereof & an Investigation (which may be avoided by an immediate Return of Congress to Philadelphia) may be promoted tending to produce mutual Irritation which it is the Duty & Policy of Congress to prevent among the Members of the Union: And more especially as the Conduct of the Executive of Pennsilvania with Respect to the Mutineers may be alledged to be justified by Events (which frequently regulate the general Opinion) the Mutiny occasioning the Removal of Congress appearing to have been digested by Negotiation & thereby the Lives of the Citizens not exposed to Destruction; & the Question therefore, whether the Council of the said State were right in not calling out the Militia for the Purpose & at the Time requested by the Committee of Congress or whether Congress were right in their Removal because such Measures were not taken as they deemed necessary, may always remain a Matter of Opinion upon which each may decide from possibly opposite Motives.  And Whereas all Enquiries into the Transaction so far as it respects Congress & the Executive of the State are unnecessary & no satisfactory Decision could be had for the Reasons before recited; but an Enquiry may produce opposite Decisions in Congress & the State which may be attended with Obstructions to federal Plans & may occasion a dangerous Breach in the fOEderal Government unless the Magnanimity of the State & their Disposition to support the true Interests & Dignity of the Confederacy, which has been so frequently & constantly evidenced, should prevail over every other Consideration.  And Whereas the public Bussiness under present Circumstances cannot be so conveniently carried on in any other Place as in Philadelphia & it will be necessary as well for Accomodation as the Acceleration of great Part of the public Bussiness to reside in a City 'till Buildings can be erected elsewhere for which there is now neither Time nor Means, & a Continuance here will on these Considerations without answering any good End, raize Jealousies in the said Citizens who will suppose that another City having fewer present Conveniencies (& liable to all the Arguments against a Residence in Cities) or Places having no other Conveniencies but a few Buildings, are the Objects with some Members whose Votes are necessary in the Decision of the Question of returning to the accustomed Place of Residence.  And Whereas it will, in the View of the People both of America & Europe, be more consonant with the Honor & Respectability of Congress to take their Measures for determining on the Place of their permanent Residence with Calmness & Deliberation & when they shall finally leave a State (if they should determine so to do) wherein they have so long & so effectually transacted the public Bussiness their Removal should not have even the Appearance of an hasty Proceedure founded on a sudden Emergency.

  My dear Sir Princeton July 26. 1783  My Hopes of the Return of Congress grow less every Day. I am extremely disgusted with the ridiculous Situation of Things here. We do no Business & seem entirely at fault. We have made a Congress but once this Week & that Day was entirely taken up with reading of Papers. The Absence of one Member breaks us up. Nine tenths of them have a secret Sigh after Philadelphia but some childish Reasons or those less innocent prevail with them. Before the Address arrived many of them wished for it to ground their return upon. The Committee have not reported but from the Complexion of it I expect Nothing.(1) Possibly their Answer may be very sweet but I will watch lest the Bee be drowned in the Honey. It seems to be the Plan of some to while away the Time here 'till it is too late to remove any where before the Period fixed for a final Resolution for our permanent Residence. At this Time they suppose the Place each has in View will stand a Chance. All agree we cannot stay here & indeed that such a Place cannot accomodate us without the necessary Buildings are previously erected. This being the Case Annapolis is inviting because there are Buildings. Williamsburg has its Conveniencies on that Account & New York will be also open. Our City is scarcely mentioned lest if we should get there we should never get out. Facilis Descensus Averno--sed revocare gradum.(2) This is the rub. I was taught to believe that if the Citizens would address everything was accomplished. But now they must have an Invitation from Council & if they dont get this they must wait JULY 26, 1783  for the Meeting of the Assembly. This will do for Procrastination. Indeed I think Council might have said something like an Invitation without derogating from their Dignity or Character. If they had or would do it every Excuse would be taken away & the Business be brought to a short Issue on the Point. All this is intended to shew the disagreeable Situation Montgomery & I will be in & to stimulate you & Wilson to join us that we may reduce the Matter to some Certainty. I therefore beg you will come here for I am not only tired but begin to lose my Temper which you know is a bad Symptom. If it is determined to stay here I think of putting something on the Journals & I wish to have the Advice of my Fellow Labourers lest anything wrong should be done. It was always understood by me that the Pennsilvania Delegates would not have joined in the Measure of Removal but that it was declared to be for a temporary Purpose. You know how this was better than I do. Some of them deny their removal to be much for a particular Purpose. But the greater Part & the President particularly declare it to be so. Shew this to Mr Wilson & take your Measures accordingly, yours with very sincere Esteem, Richard Peters [P.S.] If you do not come the Beginning of the week the affair will be over.  ""

  Dear Hannah, Saturday July 26. 1783  What an astonishing change in the weather we have here since last evening! Yesterday we had a fresh breeze all day. But out of the current of air the heat was intollerable. About 3 o clock we had a gust of wind with a little rain. After that the breeze continued from the north west, & the heat of the weather was intense so that after dark we found it only tolerable, sitting in Col. Morgan's passage with both doors open. Yet this morning I am sitting in the front parlour with a cloath waiscoat under my gown, the windows down except one left a little up to change the air, the door shut, and I find my self comfortably cool. I hope you are careful to guard against those sudden changes. I received by Mr. Bond your agreeable letter dated Thursday morning. I am obliged to Mrs. D(1) for her attention to you & for the present she sent you. I would wish you not to suffer political conduct to break off social intercourse. True friendship is rare to be found; and few characters are perfect. But the intercourse of even civilities are agreeable. And virtues may be found, which will command esteem, in persons whose conduct we cannot always approve nay must sometimes severely condemn. You know how open a certain person(2) is to flattery & who, though he has shining parts, is not remarkable for solidity of judgement. His passions are too ungovernable and he is apt to suffer himself when under their influence to be the dupe of those who will flatter his vanity. And yet he has many good qualities. I am much affraid that a young, sly & crafty politician,(3) of whose principles & conduct I have not the best Opinion, has found out his foible, and has had too much influence in the late transactions.  Nothing is yet done respecting the Adddress. We had no Congress yesterday. There were only six states in town, And I am apprehensive it will be the same to day. So that the business will rest till next week. I am inclined to think the report of the committee will not be much to my liking. I saw Duane & Williamson yesterday in Consultation on the Adddress. They are two of the comee.(4) They seemed to agree in Opinion & the latter seemed uncommonly pleased, which to me augurs no good, for I never knew him much pleased but when mischief was brewing, & in proportion to his pleasure I always judge of the degree of mischief. However I think there are so many of the members convinced of the impropriety of continuing here & of the impracticability of conducting the affairs of the Union in their present situation that they will either return back to Philada. or go home about their business. I shall stay till they come to some determination. Tell Page that Master & Bill Church are well, that B C in the beginning of the week eat too much green fruit & paid for it by being sick one day, that I ordered him to be fed next day with butter milk & charged him to eat JULY 26, 1783  no more green fruit which he observes & is now well and hearty. I am sorry poor Dick has lost his voice. I hope he will soon recover it & cheer his mistress with a song during my absence. Tell him one song to my charmer while I am absent will please me more than two to myself. My love to all friends.  I am with sincere affection, your loving husband Cha Thomson P.S. Mrs. Morgan & the children are well but the col. has got a regular ague. Yesterday he shook & had a severe fever but which went off soon with a profuse sweat. After which he came down stairs. This is his well day.

  Sir Princeton, July 27. 1783  A few days since I was honored with Your Excellency's letter of the ; and was glad to find your ideas on the subject corresponded with mine.(1) As I shall in a day or two take leave of Congress, I think it my duty to give my opinion to the legislature on a matter of importance to the state, which has been long depending and is still without a prospect of termination in the train in which it has been placed--I mean the affair of the grants.(2) It is hazardous to pass a positive judgment on what will happen in a body so mutable as that of Congress; but from all I have seen, I have come to a settled opinion, that no determination will be taken and executed by them in any other manner, than in that prescribed by the confederation. There is always such a diversity of views and interests, so many compromises to be made between different states, that in a question of this nature, the embarrassments of which have been increased by the steps that have preceded, and in which the passions of the opposite sides have taken a warm part, decision must be the result of necessity. While Congress have a discretion they will procrastinate; when they are bound by the constitution they must proceed.  It is therefore my opinion that it will be adviseable for the Legislature when they meet to review the question; and either to relinquish their pretensions to the country in dispute, or to instruct their dele- JULY 27, 1783  gates, if a decision is not had within a limited time to declare the submission to Congress revoked and to institute a claim according to the principles of the confederation. It would be out of my province to discuss which side of the alternative ought in policy to prevail; but I will take the liberty to observe that if the last should be preferred, it would be expedient to remove every motive of opposition from private claims, not only by confirming in their full latitude previous to the trial the possessions of the original settlers, but even the grants of the usurped government. It may happen that it will be eventually necessary to employ force; and in this case, it would be of great importance that neither the inhabitants of the grants, nor powerful individuals in other states, should find their private interest in contradiction to that of the state. This has already had great influence in counteracting our wishes, would continue to throw impediments in the way of ulterior measures, and might at last kindle a serious flame between the states.  I communicated to Your Excellency in a former letter that I had declined pressing the application of the legislature to Congress, respecting the state troops for garrisoning the frontier posts, because temporary provision had been made in another way,(3) which would save the state the immediate expence and because there was a prospect of some general provision for the defence of the frontiers on a Continental establishment, which was to be preferred on every account. A report for this purpose is now before Congress; but the thinness of representation has for some time retarded and still retards its consideration.(4)  The definitive treaty is not yet arrived, but from accounts, which though not official, appear to deserve credit, it may be dayly expected. A Gentleman known and confided in has arrived at Philadelphia, who informs that he saw a letter from Doctor Franklin to Mr. Barkeley(5) telling him that the definitive treaties were signed the 27th of May between all the parties--that New York was to be evacuated in six months from the ratification of the preliminaries in Europe, which will be the 12th or fifteenth of next month.  As it is not my intention to return to Congress I take this opportunity to make my respectful acknowledgement to the legislature for the honorable mark of their confidence conferred upon me, by having chosen me to represent the state in that body. I shall be happy if my conduct has been agreeable to them.(6) With perfect respect, I have the honor to be, Yr. Excellency's Most Obedient servant, Alx Hamilton ""

I returned it with strict honor, though very anxious for a copy; and advised the Chairman to make a report. This was soon done, and the report was read in Congress, whereupon I moved for a long day to be assigned for the consideration of it, both as it was an object of importance, and as in the mean time there would be an opportunity for the deputation, which was then appointed, to return from Rhode-Island with their ultimatum. Some time in February was appointed; and by a standing rule of the house, after a day is assigned for acting on a report, or other matter, each member has a right to a copy of such report or matter; and I believe, and shall believe, that the citizens of Rhode-Island and Massachusetts have as good a right to be informed of all such matters as the citizens of Philadelphia, who are daily acquainted with what is passing, and interposing their advice. Having clearly a good right to a copy, I instantly demanded one of the Secretary of Congress, and one was accordingly handed me, in a short time, by his deputy, Mr. Bond. This I transmitted to my constituents, and this I lent to several of my friends in Boston to copy; and from this your's was taken. I was not ignorant, at the time, that my conduct would be offensive, so those who wish to obtain large and undefined powers from the people, without their being fully apprized of what they are about--but I reprobate this hood-winking, this hugger-mugger way of doing business.

12028,dg020415,1783,James Madison to Edmund Randolph,"""James Madison to Edmund Randolph
  My dear Sir [July 28, 1783]  Yesterday's mail brought me no letter from you. The Address from the Citizens of Pa. came before Congs. on Thursday and was referred to a Comme. of 5 members. The answer will probably be a very civil one, but will leave open the question touching the return of Congs.(1) This question if decided at all in the affirmative, must be preceded by despair of some of the competitors, for the permanent residence, almost all of whom now make a common cause agst. Philada. It is not improbable that when the urgency of the scanty accomodations at Princeton comes to be more fully felt, with the difficulty of selecting a final Seat, among the numerous offers, that N.Y. in case of its evacuation may be brought into rivalship with Philada. for the temporary residence of Congress. My own opinion is that it would be less eligible as removing everything connected with Congs. not only farther from the South but farther from the Center, and making a removal to a Southern position finally more difficult, than it would be from Philada. Williamsbg. seems to have a very slender chance as far as I can discover. Annapolis, I apprehend wd. have a greater no. of advocates. But the best chance both for Maryland & Virga. will be to unite in offering a double jurisdiction on the Potowmack.(2) The only dangerous rival in that case will be a like offer from N.J. & Pa. on the Delaware; unless JULY 28, 1783  indeed Congs. sd. be carried into N. York before a final choice be made in which case it wd. be difficult to get them out of the State.  In order to prepare the way to their permanent residence Congs. have appd. a Come. to define the jurisdiction proper for them to be invested with. Williamsbg has asked an ex[planation] on this point.(3) The nearer the subject is viewed the less easy it is found to mark the just boundary between the authority of Congs. & that of the State on one side & on the other between the former & the privileges of the inhabitants. May it not also be made a question whether in constitutional strictness the gift of any State without the Concurrence of all the rest, can authorize Congs. to exercise any power not delegated by the Confederation? As Congs. it would seem they are incompetent to every act not warranted by that instrument or some other flowing from the same source. I wish you could spare a little attention to this subj[ect] & transmit your ideas [on] it. Contrary to my intention I shall be detained here several weeks yet by a disappointmt. in some circumstances which must precede my setting out for Vrg.(4) There is considerable ground to believe that Carlton is possessed of the definitive Treaty. He has lately sent Congs. several depositions relative to forgeries of Mr. Morris' Notes, the authors of which he has confined in N. York, & has requested that persons may be sent in to attend the examination.(5) The Court Martial is still proceeding in the inves[tigation of] the Mutiny, but have disclosed no result.(6)  ""

  Princeton 29th July 1783. I wrote my dearest Polly, to the address of General Washington,(1) on my arrival at this Town. I then mentioned to you some circumstances respecting the definitive Treaty of peace. We have further Evidence of its being signed but none official, so as to render it certain. I have, however, no doubt in my own mind that the Event has taken place and wait impatiently for an Arrival from Europe. Here we have no news. Whether Congress will hold their Sessions at this Town or remove elsewhere is a Question I cannot ascertain. The Citizens of Philadelphia are anxious for our Return from an Apprehension that it will be a Reproach to them, if it shoud be abandond under the Idea that there is not Strength nor Inclination to keep the peace so that Government may perform it's Duties without Interruption. Other States are making large offers for securing the Advantages of our permanent Residence. It is impossible to Judge how this Business will be decided....

  Dear Hannah Tuesday July 29 1783. Yesterday the Commee. Reported and Congress agreed to and passed an Answer to the address of the citizens.(1) It turns out just as I suspected. D has exerted his Cunning to gratify the malice of W,(2) and I dare say they value themselves on their skill & adroitness in waving the question of returning and passing over that part of the address which pointed to that. The address concludes with a solemn assurance \""in testimony of the affections of the citizens to that Union, which has so happily succeeded in accomplishing the freedom and independence of America, that if either now or at any future time until the residence of Congress shall be permanently established it should appear to that honble. body that the situation of Philadelphia is convenient for transacting therein the concerns of the Nation, Congress may repose the utmost confidence in its Inhabitants not only to prevent any circumstances, which may have a tendency to disturb their necessary deliberations but to aid in all measures to support the national honor and dignity.  JULY 29, 1783  The committee with great circumspection has passed unnoticed the former part of this solemn assurance & confined themselves wholly to that contained in the last line. However as at courts compliments are used to suppy the place of sincerity the answer is drawn up in terms of great civility as follows.  \""That the president inform the citizens of Philadelphia and its liberties in answer to their respectful & affectionate Address that the United States in Congress have great satisfaction in reviewing the spirited and patriotic exertions which have been made by the government and citizens of Pensylvania in the course of the late glorious war and that they are highly pleased with the resolution expressed by the citizens of Philadelphia to aid in all measures which may have a tendency to support the national honor and dignity.\"" Mr. S. Huntington arrived yesterday with his Collegue B. Huntington from Connecticut. so that to day we shall have eight states represented. These two have taken up their quarters in the stone house at the foot of the hill beyond Col Morgan's cornfield. Mr. Beresford who has brought up his lady have taken a house below Jug town. Thus are the members dispersed among the neighbouring farm houses. How far they are in a situation to conduct public business their works will manifest, and if in their present situation they long preserve respect, I shall be greatly disappointed.  I was invited to be of a party this evening at a tavern to dance & play cards. My answer was that I had resisted the allurements of Philadelphia and could not suffer myself to be drawn aside by the charms of Princeton. I therefore hoped to be excused in not accepting the invitation. Some time ago a fellow stuck up an advertisement at a tavern door that he would entertain ladies and gentlemen with an exhibition of puppets, that would divert the company in three languages & that his next exhibition would be better than the last. Some of the members proposed as there were no other diversions in this place to entertain the ladies with a puppet show. I gravely answered that it would be well to consider how this would read in Oswald's next paper, in which they might expect to see this curious paragraph. \""The public may be assured that the Congress of the U.S. are perfectly recovered from their late fright; for on ______ evening last they entertained the ladies of Princeton with a puppet show.\"" I long greatly to hear from you. I have not received a letter since that brought by Mr. Bond. I pray you to write to me as often as possible and take care of your health.  I am with sincere affection, Dear Hannah, your loving husband Cha Thomson (NjP: Thomson Letters). 1 See Richard Peters to Thomas FitzSimons, July 23, note 2, and July 26; and Elias Boudinot to Thomas Willing, July 30, 1783.

  Dear Sir, Princeton 30th July 1783 After visiting my parents & friends in Morris County, in which I spent two days, & in Philadelphia in Company with Mr. Ellery & Dr. Arnold in which I spent from Friday till the next Tuesday, there being no House in the mean time, I took my Seat in Congress on Wednesday the 23d Instant.(1)  I found my Father in good health & strength for his age, being in the 75th year thereof. My oldest Brother has suceeded in a Lawsuit, in which he has been involved some years, in regard to the Title of Land adjoining him of much value; he will now have a farm of about 400 acres of good land all lying contiguous.  My friends in Philadelphia received me with joy; some have fallen away, & I fear \""it is impossible to renew them again to repentance.\""(2) Messieurs Hewes & Anthony & others enquired affectionately of the welfare of their friends in Providence. Some of Mr. Morris's notes, & some Connecticutt money have been lately counterfeited in New York. A Letter has lately been received & read in Congress giving an account of the detection of this forgery & containing sundry depositions relative thereto & the confessions of one of the culprits. These papers are referred to committee.(3) This proceeding of the commander at New York is well spoken of here; as it is a most explicit & practical acknowledgement of our national character.  JULY 30, 1783  The State of Maryland has appropriated part of their quota on the requisition of Congress for the year 1782 to the payment of part of the arrears due to their troops. This was done without any previous application to Congress to approbate the measure. Massachusetts delegates have applied for permission to do the same; but in vain.(4) This conduct of Maryland is severely reprehended by the advocates for Continental measures; & having been done after they had solemnly, by a resolve of their own Legislature appropriated it to the U. States & without any previous notice given either to Congress or Mr. Morris is not perhaps justifiable; but as it has a tendency to frustrate a System calculated to injure the Sovereignty & subvert the Liberties of the individual States, it gives me no great uneasiness. Dr. Arnolds arrival, which will have taken place long before this will reach you, will spare me the necessity of enlarging on the State, in which I found the publick business. There has not been more than seven States on the floor at a time since my arrival 'till yesterday; and nine States being then present the earliest occasion was taken to ratify the Treaty of amity & commerce lately entred into with the king of Sweden. This was done at Paris the 3d of last April by Dr. Franklin Minister Plenipotentiary in behalf of the U. States & the Count Gustavus Philip De Creutz on the part of Sweden; the publication of the treaty & of the proclamation enjoining the observation thereof will be suspended 'till the acts of the Sovereign powers ratifying the acts of their ministers shall be mutually exchanged. The treaty is similar to those with France & Holland. General Howe, who had the command of the troops detached from the Army to go to Philadelphia in order to bring to condign punishment the mutineers in that City, has proceeded in apprehending & examining the principal offenders, whose trial is now going on before a Court-martial constituted for that purpose, & is Directed by a resolve of yesterday(5) to send back to the army such of the 3 years men under his command as shall not longer be necessary to effect the purposes for which they were detached.  A resolve has passed that the late mutineers, having discovered themselves unworthy of that confidence in which was founded the resolve allowing the troops to be furloughed to carry home their arms, shall not be entitled to the benefit of that resolve.(6)  Congress have received respectful & affectionate addresses from all ranks of people in our present Environs, expressive of the high Sense they entertain of the honor done them in the choice of residence, & of their readiness to defend the persons & support the dignity of the Members of Congress & thereby maintain the honor & importance of the great Council of the nation. An address has also been received from the citizens of Philadelphia & its Liberties. They recount their services in turning out men--paying taxes--establishing a bank, &c.  &c. To this address Congress have returned a suitable answer; tho' not such an one as the Delegates of Pennsylvania expected. By this answer as well as a variety of circumstances, there is good reason to believe that we are posted for the Summer Season at least.  The amenity of our Situation in this little village, the Salubrity of the air, & the courteousness of the Inhabitants all conspire to influence our determination in favour of this place. I discover no want of fresh meat, or vegetables, tho, I am informed that it is reported in Philadelphia that vegetables are bought in their market for our use. Weekly board is cheaper here than in Philadelphia; in other things there is no great difference and some things are dearer; such are shop goods, liquors, sowing &c. Mr. Ellery & myself are for the present stored in a small house about 50 rods from the College. This was a store when I was in College. It will be difficult when there shall be a full representation to procure suitable Lodgings for the whole, as well as for the foreign ministers & great officers of Congress, & their attendants; but in whatever place Congress shall establish their permanent residence there will be no difficulty in erecting suitable buildings in the course of one year, and all the places which are in Competition for this Honor have offered besides an exempt jurisdiction, sufficient funds for this necessary purpose. As you have been informed the question of the permant residence of Congress has been referred to October next; & from appearances I entertain great hopes that, whether any other place may be agreed on or not, a sufficient number of voices will not be obtained for Philadelphia.  Messieurs Holten & Higginson, the present Delegates for Massachusetts are good republicans & perfectly with me in political measures. It gives me pain that they are to return in Nov. next as it is uncertain what part their Successors may take. My good friends Mr. A. Lee & Col. Bland of Virginia received me with a smile of welcome & cooperate in every measure for maintaining the Sovereignty of the Individual States, as well as several other gentlemen from other States. It is astonishing to me that several Gentlemen in Congress could ever have given their voices for the late revenue recommendation in consistence with their present declared opinions. I can account for it no otherwise than by recurring to what I was told in New Haven by a gentleman who asked a certain delegate of that State(7) how he came to give his voice for the commutation resolve, having always theretofore been against half-pay? He answered with honesty that, it was true he voted against his own opinion & against the opinion of his State, known to him at the time but that he could, as things were circumstanced, vote no otherwise!!!!!!!  I conceive great hopes that things will take a different turn in Congress now it is removed from the unhealthful & dangerous atmosphere of Philadelphia. It is observed by some Gentlemen that an ob-  vious alteration has taken place in the House on some debates of yesterday & today wherein the office of Finance is concerned & wherein I took perhaps too great a part,(8) considering the short time I have been here & that measures are carried which, in their opinion would have met with more opposition heretofore. Mr. Madison of Virginia & Mr. Hamilton of New York have left the House since my return;(9) hope their services at home will attone for any loss the public may sustain by their absence.  It is the decided opinion of several members of Congress that the late revenue recommendation will not be adopted by the States & that as Mr. Holten did me the honor to observe, the States will be daily more & more convinced of the propriety & necessity of falling in with my plan & establishing revenues within themselves & retaining the absolute controul over their own purse strings. Mr. Stelle is exceedingly embarrassed in the execution of his Commission for want of more explicit instructions. He has proposed sundry queries to Congress, which have been referred to the office of Finance for a Solution; but no report has yet been made.(10) He finds himself injured by the delay. I know not the reason, & it becomes not to be uncharitable; but it is a fact that nothing is done to quiet the creditors of the public; but every thing to alarm them & to interest them on the side of administration. I shall soon move in the interesting affair of consolidating the public Securities; but expect to meet with every opposition from the advocates for continental measures.  You will naturally ask how I was received & how treated in Congress? For answer I shall only observe that I have received every politeness & attention to be expected from the members of Congress & from the Secretary at War, who was pleased in a walk which he, Col. Bland, Mr. Higginson & Mr. Ellery & myself took yesterday to observe to Mr. Ellery apart, as Mr. Ellery afterwards informed me, that he had full confidence in me as a friend to this Country & that he thought me capable of making my ground good on any occasion. The Minister of France also treats me with his usual respect & familiarity. Mr. Morris I have not seen & the office for Foreign Affairs remains vacant, as I hope it will.  Some three or four members of Congress affect to be shy of me; but I am looked upon by the body as the successful opposer of a ruinous & exploded System & treated with as much, if not more attention than it is in my vanity to believe I deserve. What may be stirred up against me I cannot tell, neither do I fear; but at present I am well satisfied, with my treatment.  The Delegates of Virginia, by instruction from their Assembly have applied to Congress for Liberty to fit out & maintain at their own expence two armed vessels to protect their trade against Smugglers & to aid their collectors in the collection of such duties on their trade as  may be imposed by authority. This application lies on the Table & will no doubt pass in a few days; there appearing no considerable opposition against it.(11) Quere does this look like falling in with Continental measures? If so, will the Chesapeake be wide enough to contain Mr. Morris's boats, as well as those of the ancient dominion? And will armed vessels be less necessary to collect continental, than State duties? And should the Continental Frigate quit tobacco droging & fall to battering the Virginia cutters, would it not prove an happy means of cementing & perpetuating the Union of the States?  The substantial points on which the cause of 5 per Cent rests are better understood in Congress as well as in the States than they were last year. General Washingtons circular Letter(12) is now the toast. It is the Sheat anchor of the cause; & coxcombs will refer you to that, who cannot state an argument from it, or comprehend the force of any argument in the plainest cause. I revere that character almost to a pitch of Idolatry & it gives me pain to reflect that so good a man should be induced from any motives to give sanction by his personal authority to so destructive a measure: But it is enough to observe that he has also lent his Sanction to the resolve for commutation.  It has been reported & generally believed for some days that the definitive Treaty arrived in the Mercury; but this opinion loses ground. No official, or certain account has yet been received of its signature. It remains uncertain at what time the evacuation of New York will take place; but from some appearance there is reason to hope for it soon. Hitherto I have been very happy with Mr. Ellery. He has supported me on every occasion & speaks the Sense of the State. His Excellency General Washington is to attend at Congress to assist in forming a peace establishment;(13) upon this Subject I find a variety of opinions. It is a fortunate circumstance that this Subject is to undergo its canvassing determination before Congress can be certain whether the States will vest them with a revenue, or not. From the disposition of some Gentlemen I have reason to believe that if Congress had a revenue at command our peace establishment would make no contemptible figure. The jurisdictional powers of Congress are much agitated. It seems agreed that an exempt jurisdiction will be ceded to Congress over a certain tract, or extent of territory whereever they shall establish their permanent residence; but gentlemen are not agreed in the principle mode, &c, of this jurisdiction. This is referred to a Committee. I hope to live long enough to see their report,(14) which I flatter myself will afford entertainment. I pray you, my worthy & good friend to communicate this Letter to his Honor the Deputy Governor, & to the members of both houses of Assembly as occasion offers--to any of our other friends & particularly to my friend Mr. Carter.   I also pray to be respectfully remembred to Mrs Brown & to the several Branches of your family to whom I feel myself under many obligations.  With real esteeme, Believe me to be, Dear Sir, your affectionate friend & very hble Servt, David Howell ""

  Dear Hannah Wednesday July 30. 1783 I received by Mr. Remsen(1) your very agreeable letter dated Saturday and continued on till Monday. I was the more pleased as we had the most dismal accounts of the heat of the weather and of the mortality in Philadelphia. You will please to observe that I have written to you every morning except Sunday and dated my letters with the days of  JULY 30, 1783  the week as well as of the month so that you will easily see whether all my letters have come to hand.  I have observed carefully all your cautions respecting my self and had pursued the measures recommended respecting William. I ordered him to write to his mother, but you know how slow he is in his motions. I question whether he will have his letter ready even to go with this. He is well. The house and lot you enquire about is Mr. Berrier's, on the left hand at the end of the town as you go to Mrs. Stockdens. I do not wonder at your not recollecting such a house as is described in the Advertisement. I assure you it appears very different on paper from what it is in reality. The description in the news paper reminds me of the Irishmans advertisement. His master missed a pair of yarn stocking, when he called his servant to account. The servant said they were lost or stolen but he would soon get them. How will you get them? I have advertised them. You rascal they are not worth the price of an Advertisement and will disgrace me if you have described them. O Master! I have taken care of that, I have advertised them as silk stockings.  I wish the general success, but I am afraid if he should carry his point, the soil is so old that it will yield little produce. You may tell Robert I am busily engaged in the study of Agriculture and preparing some directions for him in the management of his farm.  Yesterday Mr. Hamilton called on his way home, so that for about an hour 9 states were represented in Congress. This short interval was improved to ratify the treaty with Sweden.(2) As soon as this was done he left Congress and proceeded on to his state so that we have now only 8 states in town. Not a word has yet been said of the return of Congress. Though every day's experience evinces that this is not a proper place. And the members are daily more & more convinced of it & their chagrin and vexation encrease. I am persuaded they will take up the matter soon--I think in the course of this week. I shall therefore wait the issue. Bond has given me notice that he intends to quit the Office as soon as Newyork is evacuated.(3) In the mean while he proposes to move his family to this place and has taken for them Mr. Morgan's house at the gate where the Office is now kept. For my own part I am determined to continue. I have contributed as much as in my power to erect the building & it shall tumble about my ears before I quit it. You have not said a word about Dick in your last. Has he recovered his voice? or is his harp still unstrung and hung on the willow? I hope Page, Cloe and Moll are well. Please to tell Peter I expect he will rise a little sooner and not keep his Mistress so long without her breakfast. I shall consider any failure in my absence ten times greater than when I am at home & resent it accordingly. My love to all friends. Take care of your health.

  Dear sir, Princeton, state of New Jersey, July 31. 1783. I have recd. the letter you did me the honor to write, the 3d instant.  So far as the attention of my friends proceeded from personal respect, I feel myself under renewed obligations, but as for any services to the public it cou'd be, but of little consequence, and therefore I shou'd have wish'd not to have given them trouble.  By the account you are pleas'd to give me the commutation made with the officers of the army operated against my honorable Colleagues as well as myself but I shall leave them to speak for themselves. So far as that transaction respects me personally, I am content to stand or fall in the opinion of the world; but I think that justice to myself requires, that I should make some observations Upon this matter; I was not in Congress when the promises were made to the officers, and therefore can't be chargeable with making the engagements;(1) but finding that the promises had been made to them by Congress, I did not think myself at liberty to trifle with national engagements, or say I wou'd not comply with them; but at the same time had reason to think that half pay for life was disagreeable to my constituents; therefore under these circumstances I was in favor of trying to make a commutation with them, which for many reasons I cou'd mention I thought woud be more in favor of Masstts. & less exceptionable to them; great pains were taken to find out what was likely to be their due according to the common period of mens lives, & 22 years seemed to be the number agreed in; and that we should have to pay them half pay this number of years, or 11 years full pay, and then it was thought adviseable to offer them 5 years full pay, in such securities as Congress gave their other creditors; & Now it is for you Sir to judge, and every other person that is acquainted with the subject, whether the present Congress has made a good bargain and how far I have been to blame in assenting to the same. But it is said that Massachusetts is not in favor of half pay, commutation, or any thing else farther than their wages, if so, I have to lament, that they did not signify their pleasure to their delegates by instructions, which wou'd have been the rule of my conduct, and then I should not have considered myself personally answerable for the consequences; know doubt, you will observe I have chose to treat this subject only as it respects my personal conduct, which I consider is all that is necessary when writing to a Friend; 'tho' I wish you to consider that I am not unacquainted with the state of our army at the time when the engagements were made, & that much could be said in favor of Congress, respecting the promises they made them; neither have I thought it advisable to mention the merits or services of the officers, or what might have JULY 31, 1783  been the consequences to this people if the engagements entered into by Congress had not been complied with, or a commutation proposed.  I find that it is the opinion of some persons that commutation was not the only reason, and that a change was considered necessary in the delegation from Masstts. & that for political purposes probably it originated nearer Phila. than Boston,(2) if so, it was a grand political movement something like what I expected & tho' they succeeded in the first attempt to get the Gentlemen out, yet I am very sure they have failed in the 2d. for the Honble Gentlemen that are to succeed us, from my personal knowledge of them, will not be less zealous in supporting the honor & attending to the interest of their constituents, or of their sovereignty and Independence.  You are pleas'd to ask my opinion respecting the old continental bills, I can only say, that it lays before Congress as the order of the day, but there has not been nine state[s] represented in Congress for a length of time excepting half a day, notwithstanding, I think there has been of late four applications to the delinquent States to keep up their representation; Congress are such a body that it is difficult to form a judgment what will be their next resolution upon this subject; but in whatever point of light the services of the delegates From Masstts. are considered by their constituents, I assure you, sir, they are not inattentive to this important affair.  It gives me real concern to hear of his Excellency's indisposition. I have the honor to be, with sincere respect, your most obedient  ""

  Sir. Princeton, 3lst July, 1783.  We have been honored with your letter of instructions, from the general Court of the 26th ultimo; and immediately invited the attention of Congress to the important matters therein contained, and 'tho' we improved every opportunity to expedite their final determination upon the motion we had the honor to lay before them, and the several matters that came under their consideration in consequence thereof, it was not 'till yesterday, that the inclosed resolutions were come into,(1) which you have now the honor to forward; and 'tho' JULY 31, 1783  Congress have not thought it adviseable to comply with the wishes of the Honorable Court, in permitting an order to Mr. Lovell, to pay to that part of the continental army which belongs to Massachusetts, out of its continental tax for the year 1782, the wages that are due to them, or any part thereof; yet we hope our meritorious soldiers will reap some advantages from these determinations of Congress, by not only preventing their notes from depreciating, but in a short time of receiving their money; and by our instructions, we are required to give the earliest information on this subject; therefore we thought it adviseable, to make you acquainted with the affair, so far as Congress have already proceeded, 'tho' they have a committee at this time, examining into the reasons why the soldiers did not receive their pay agreeably to the expectations of Congress before they were discharged, or whether there has been any fraudulent proceedings, respecting their receiving payment; for there seems not to be an agreement between the representation made by the Honorable Court to their delegates, and the returns from the Regimental paymasters, of the line of Massachusetts; if Congress should come into any farther resolutions upon this subject, or any thing be discovered relative thereto, worthy of the attention of the Court; we shall do ourselves the honor to communicate it.(2) We take notice of another important matter altho' only barely mentioned in said instructions, and that is the \""old money,\"" but we are still under the same embarrassment, that we had the honor of informing the Court of, some time since, there not being such a representation in Congress as are authorized to come into any determination upon this matter, altho' the delinquent states have been repeatedly requested to keep up their representation, & therefore, we can only say, that as soon as nine states are present, we shall immediately give that attention to it, that such an important subject requires. We have also been favored with your attention of the 17th instant, accompanying an address to Congress, by way of remonstrance;(3) and after perusing it, we complied with your pleasure signified to us, and delivered it to the President and it was read in Congress, & committed, and you may be assured of our attention to the same, when it shall again come before Congress.  We also take notice, that the Honorable Court has been pleased to appoint a committee to correspond with the delegates of Massachusetts in Congress, \""on the subject matter contained in the late address to the several states in the union, respecting an Impost, and half pay, and the proposed commutation with the officers of the army, and other important matters which relate to the being & welfare of these united states;\""(4) And being desirous of carrying on such a correspondence as may fully answer the intentions of the Honorable Court, we have to request, that you wou'd be pleased, in your next, to ac-  quaint us whether there is any particular matter respecting these important affairs, that the Court wish to be better informed about: or whether it is expected that we treat the several subjects at large as shall be thought most proper.

Perhaps before this reaches you the president will have transmitted our resolve for bringing you here and relieving you from that disagreeable situation of which you have so justly complained in your letter to Congress. I was chairman of the committee on that letter and reported the substance of the resolve which will give us the pleasure of your company.(1) The original resolve was that we should avail ourselves of your experience and advice in the formation of the peace establishment--but this was looped off in order to get Rhode Island to agree to the other. This state is opposed to a peace establishment. You will however prepare yourself on this subject as you will be consulted on it, and bring with you such papers as may be necessary. To-morrow we shall make a motion to have proper accommodations provided.

12043,dg020430,1783,Alexander Hamilton s Defense of Congress,"""Alexander Hamilton's Defense of Congress
  [July ? 1783] However men actuated by private pique or party views may take pleasure in stigmatizing the conduct of Congress with or without reason, considerate and good men who are solicitous for the honor of their country will act upon very different principles. They will view with regret those instances in which the measures of that body may be really intitled to blame, will be cautious how they bestow it where it is not  JULY ?, 1783  merited, and will always examine with candour before they condemn. Though it is certainly true that the infallibility of that or any other body is a doctrine to be reprobated in a free country, and a servile complaisance to its errors would be as dangerous as despicable; yet it must be allowed that an opposite extreme may be little less pernicious. A captious disposition to arraign without examination, to accumulate undistinguishing censure, to excite jealousies against the phantom without the substance of power, to blame for defects in the constitution itself not in the administration of it, is a vice of nearly as mischievous a tendency in the public mind as a blind and superstitious reverence. In the present circumstances of this country most evil is to be apprehended from the prevalency of the former spirit; for new governments emerging out of a revolution, are naturaly deficient in authority and require that every effort should be made to strengthen not to undermine the public confidence. This observation applies with peculiar force to the government of the union; the constitutional imbecillity of which must be apparent to every man of reflexion. It is therefore painful to hear, as is too fashionable a practice, indiscriminate censures heaped upon Congress for every public failure and misfortune; without considering the intire disproportion between the means which that body have it in their power to employ and their responsibility. It is equally exceptionable to see all the errors of their predecessors concentered in a mass of accusation against the subsisting body. If there have been meritorious acts performed by Congress at any period of the revolution, all the praise of it is confined to the immediate actors; if there have been faults committed they descend with increasing odium upon all who come after. The good deeds of Congress die or go off the stage with the individuals who are the authors of them; but their mistakes are the inheritance of all those who succeed.  It is true Congress in a political capacity are perpetual; but the individuals who compose it in fact undergo frequent changes. It is not more reasonable to charge any present set of members for the mismanagement of a former set allowing it to be real; than it would be to impute to George 3 the adulteries or murders(2) of Henry the 8th. It is a principle of the English law that the King never dies; and yet no man in his senses on account of this fiction of the law will transfer to the reigning monarch the infamy of his predecessor's misconduct. It is not less unjust or absurd to blame a subsisting Congress the greater part of whose members have had no agency in the measures which are the objects of crimination, for the ill consequences of those measures. It is not much to be wondered at that this error should exist among the uninformed parts of the community, who can only be expected to have general notions of Congress without any precise ideas of their  JULY ? 1783  constitution--and who therefore will be disposed to view them always under the same form without attending to the changes which the body is continually undergoing. But when men more enlightened fall into the same fallacy it is an argument of disingenuous intentions, and proves them to be under the influence of passion of prejudice or of something worse.  The chief topics of clamour against Congress are either positive breaches of faith by avowed departures from express stipulations as the reduction of the Continental money from forty to one, or negative, as the general nonperformance of the public engagements.  As to those of the first kind without entering into a discussion of particular instances, without examining whether those which may have happened may have been produced by inexperience, necessity, levity or design, it will be sufficient in justification of the present Congress to say that a large majority of them had no share whatever in those acts which are the subject of complaint. And As to those of the last kind, there always has been and is a conclusive and satisfactory answer to be given for Congress. The power of raising money is not vested in them. All they can do is to assign their quotas to the several states and to make requisitions from them. This they have not failed to do in the most ample manner; and if the states do not comply to enable them to execute their engagements, the delinquency is not to be charged upon Congress. Should it be said that Congress ought not to have made engagements without the power of fulfilling them, this is to say that they ought to have given up the contest and to have betrayed the liberty of America. It was necessary to incur debts to support the revoluion; and no man who is a sincere friend to it, can be serious in advancing the position that this essential resource ought not to have been employed from a scruple of that nature. If Congress indeed after a definitive conclusion of the peace consent to be the instruments of future engagements, without more effectual provision at their disposal, they will then merit the indignation of every honest man.  But the present Congress have more than this general argument to offer in their vindication. They can say with truth that so far from having committeed any positive violations of faith, they have manifested an uniform and anxious solicitude for the restoration of public credit, and for doing complete justice to every class of public creditor. Having found by repeated and dayly experience that the provisions of the confederation were unequal to the purpose; they have had recourse to extraordinary expedients. Their plan of th (3) for funding the public debt is now depending before the several legislatures, nor is it possible for them to give a more decisive proof of their disposition to justice than is contained in that plan.   Portrait of Alexaner Hamilton  Congress stand in a very delicate and embarrassing situation: on one hand they are blamed for not doing what they have no means of doing on another their attempts are branded with the imputations of a spirit of encroachment and a lust of power. In these circumstances it is the duty of all those who have the welfare of the community at heart to unite their efforts to direct the attention of the people to the true source of the public disorders the want of an efficient general government and to impress upon them this conviction that these states to be happy must have a stronger bond of Union and a Confederation capable of drawing forth the resources of the Country. This will be a more laudable occupation than that of cavilling against measures, the imperfection of which is the necessary result of the constitution.  It may appear extraordinary that these observations should be introductory to remarks on the transaction which at this time principally engages the public attention--to wit the removal of Congress from this city; but there is a chain of ideas which naturally connects the general opinion of Congress with the judgment to be passed upon their conduct in this particular instance. This chain will easily be traced by men of discernment. ""

12044,dg020431,1783,Alexander Hamilton s Draft Resolution,"""Alexander Hamilton's Draft Resolution
  [July ? 1783](1) Whereas in the opinion of this Congress the confederation of the United States is defective in the following essential points, to wit: First and generally in confining the power of the fOEderal government within too narrow limits, witholding from it that efficacious authority and influence in all matters of general concern which are indispensable to the harmony and welfare of the whole--embarrassing general provisions by unnecessary details and inconvenient exceptions incompatible with their nature tending only to create jealousies JULY ? 1783  and disputes respecting the proper bounds of the authority of the United States and of that of the particular states, and a mutual interference of the one with the other.  Secondly. In confounding legislative and executive powers in a single body, as that of determining on the number and quantity of force, land and naval, to be employed for the common defence, and of directing their operations when raised and equipped--with that of ascertaining and making requisitions for the necessary sums or quantities of money to be paid by the respective states into the common treasury; contrary to the most approved and well founded maxims of free government which require that the legislative, executive and judicial authorities should be deposited in distinct and separate hands.  Thirdly. In the want of a FOEderal Judicature having cognizance of all matters of general concern in the last resort, especially those in which foreign nations, and their subjects are interested; from which defect, by the interference of the local regulations of particular states militating directly or indirectly against the powers vested in the Union, the national treaties will be liable to be infringed, the national faith to be violated and the public tranquillity to be disturbed.  Fourthly. In vesting the United States in Congress assembled with the power of general taxation, comprehended in that of \""ascertaining the necessary sums of money to be raised for the common defence and of appropriating and applying the same for defraying the public expences\""--and yet rendering that power, so essential to the existence of the union, nugatory, by witholding from them all controul over either the imposition or the collection of the taxes for raising the sums required; whence it happens that the inclinations not the abilities of the respective states are in fact the criterion of their contributions to the common expence; and the public burthen has fallen and will continue to fall with very unequal weight.  5thly. In fixing a rule for determining the proportion of each state towards the common expence which if practicable at all, must in the execution be attended with great expence, inequality, uncertainty and difficulty.  6thly. In authorising Congress \""to borrow money or emit bills on the credit of the United States\"" without the power of establishing funds to secure the repayment of the money borrowed or the redemption of the bills emitted; from which must result one of these evils, either a want of sufficient credit in the first instance to borrow, or to circulate the bills emitted, whereby in great national exigencies the public safety may be endangered, or in the second instance, frequent infractions of the public engagements, disappointments to lenders, repetitions of the calamities of depreciating paper, a continuance of the injustice and mischiefs of an unfunded debt, and first or last the annihilation of public credit. Indeed, in authorising Congress at all to  JULY ?, 1783  emit an unfunded paper as the sign of value, a resource which though useful in the infancy, of this country, indispensable in the commencement of the revolution, ought not to continue a formal part of the constit[u]tion, nor ever hereafter to be employed, being it [in] its nature pregnant with abuses and liable to be made the engine of imposition and fraud, holding out temptations equally pernicious to the integrity of government and to the morals of the people.  7thly. In not making proper or competent provision for interior or exterior defence: for interior defence, by leaving it to the individual states to appoint all regimental officers of the land forces, to raise the men in their own way, to cloath, arm and equip them at the expence of the United States; from which circumstances have resulted and will hereafter result, great confusion in the military department, continual disputes of rank, languid and disproportionate levies of men, an enormous increase of expence for want of system and uniformity in the manner of conducting them, and from the competitions of state bounties; by an ambiguity in the 4th clause of the 6th article, susceptible of a construction which would devolve upon the particular states in time of peace the care of their own defence both by sea and land and would preclude the United states from raising a single regiment or building a single ship, before a declaration of war, or an actual commencement of hostilities; a principle dangerous to the confederacy in different respects, by leaving the United states at all times unprepared for the defence of their common rights, obliging them to begin to raise an army and to build and equip a navy at the moment they would have occasion to employ them, and by putting into the hands of a few states, who from their local situations are more immediately exposed, all the standing forces of the country; thereby not only leaving the care of the safety of the whole to a part which will naturally be both unwilling and unable to make effectual provision at its particular expence, but also furnishing grounds of jealousy and distrust between the states; unjust in its operation to those states in whose hands they are by throwing the exclusive burthen of maintaining those forces upon them, while their neighbours immediately and all the states ultimately would share the benefits of their services: For exterior defence, in authorising Congress \""to build and equip a navy\"" without providing any means of manning it, either by requisitions of the states, by the power of registering and drafting the seamen in rotation, or by embargoes in cases of emergency, to induce them to accept employment on board the ships of war; the omission of all which leaves no other resource than voluntary inlistment, a resource which has been found ineffectual in every country, and for reasons of peculiar force in this.  8thly. In not vesting in the United States a general superintendence of trade, equally necessary in the view of revenue and regulation; of   revenue because duties on commerce, when moderate, are one of the most agreeable and productive species of it, which cannot without great disadvantages be imposed by particular states, while others refrain from doing it, but must be imposed in concert, and by laws operating upon the same principles, at the same moment, in all the states, otherwise those states which should not impose them would engross the commerce of such of their neighbours as did; of regulation because by general prohibitions of particular articles, by a judicious arrangement of duties, sometimes by bounties on the manufacture or exportation of certain commodities, injurious branches of commerce might be discouraged, favourable branches encouraged, useful products and manufactures promoted; none of which advantages can be as effectually attained by separate regulations, without a general superintending power; because also, it is essential to the due observance of the commercial stipulations of the United States with foreigner powers, an in[ter]ference with which will be unavoidable if the different states have the exclusive regulation of their own trade and of course the construction of the treaties entered into. 9thly. In defeating essential powers by provisos and limitations inconsistent with their nature; as the power of making treaties with foreign nations, \""provided that no treaty of commerce shall be made whereby the legislative power of the respective states shall be restrained from imposing such imposts and duties on foreigners as their own people are subjected to, or from prohibitting the importation or exportation of any species of goods or commodities whatsoever,\"" a proviso susceptible of an interpretation which includes a constitutional possibility of defeating the treaties of commerce entered into by the United States: As also the power \""of regulating the trade and managing all affairs with the Indians not members of any of the states provided that the legislative right of any state within its own limits be not infringed or violated\""--and others of a similar nature.  10thly. In granting the United States the sole power \""of regulating the alloy and value of coin struck by their own authority, or by that of the respective states\"" without the power of regulating the foreign coin in circulation; though the one is essential to the due exercise of the other, as there ought to be such proportions maintained between the national and foreign coin as will give the former a preference in all internal negotiations; and without the latter power, the operations of government in a matter of primary importance to the commerce and finances of the United States will be exposed to numberless obstructions.  11thly. In requiring the assent of nine states to matters of principal importance and of seven to all others, except adjournments from day to day; a rule destructive of vigour, consistency or expedition in the administration of affairs, tending to subject the sense of the majority to that of the minority, by putting it in the power of a small combination  to retard and even to frustrate the most necessary measures and to oblige the greater number, in cases which require speedy determinations, as happens in the most interesting concerns of the community, to come into the views of the smaller; the evils of which have been felt in critical conjunctures and must always make the spirit of government, a spirit of compromise and expedient, rather than of, system and energy.  12thly. In vesting in the FOEderal government the sole direction of the interests of the United States in their intercourse with foreign nations, without empowering it to pass all general laws in aid and support of the laws of nations; for the want of which authority, the faith of the United States may be broken, their reputation sullied, and their peace interrupted by the negligence or misconception of any particular state.  And Whereas experience hath clearly manifested that the powers reserved to the Union in the Confederation are unequal to the purpose of effectually d[r]awing forth the resources of the respective members for the common welfare and defence; whereby the United States have upon several occasions been exposed to the most critical and alarming situations; have wanted an army adequate to their defence and proportioned to the abilities of the country--have on account of that deficiency seen essential posts reduced, others eminently endangered, whole states and large parts of others overrun and ravaged by small bodies of the enemy's forces--have been destitute of sufficient means of feeding, cloathing, paying and appointing that army, by which the troops, rendered less efficient for military operations, have been exposed to sufferings, which nothing but unparallelled patience, perseverance and patriotism could have endured--whereby also the United States have been too often compelled to make the administration of their affairs a succession of temporary expedients, inconsistent with order, OEconomy, energy or a scrupulous adherence to the public engagements; and now find themselves at the close of a glorious struggle for independence, without any certain means of doing justice to those who have been its principal supporters--to an army which has bravely fought and patiently suffered--to citizens who have chearfully lent their money, and to others who have in different ways contributed their property and their personal service to the common cause; obliged to rely for the only effectual mode of doing that justice, by funding the debt on solid securities, on the precarious concurrence of thirteen distinct deliberatives, the dissent of either of which may defeat the plan and leave these states at this early period of their existence involved in all the disgrace and mischiefs of violated faith and national bankruptcy. And Whereas notwithstanding we have by the blessing of providence so far happily escaped the complicated dangers of such a situa-  tion, and now see the object of our wishes secured by an honorable peace, it would be unwise to hazard a repetition of the same dangers and embarrassments in any future war in which these states may be engaged, or to continue this extensive empire under a government unequal to its protection and prosperity.  And Whereas it is essential to the happiness and security of these states, that their union, should be established on the most solid foundations, and it is manifest that this desireable object cannot be elected but by a government capable both in peace and war of making every member of the Union contribute in just proportion to the common necessities, and of combining and directing the forces and wills of the several parts to a general end; to which purposes in the opinion of Congress the present confederation is altogether inadequate.  And Whereas on the spirit which may direct the councils and measures of these states at the present juncture may depend their future safety and welfare; Congress conceive it to be their duty freely to state to their constituents the defects which by experience have been discovered in the present plan of the FOEderal Union and solemnly to call their attention to a revisal and amendment of the same:  Therefore Resolved that it be earnestly recommended to the several states to appoint a convention to meet a on the day of with full powers to revise the confederation and to adopt and propose such alterations as to them shall appear necessary to be finally approved or rejected by the states respectively--and that a Committee of be appointed to prepare an address upon the subject.

  [July ? 1783](1) To the CITIZENS of Philadelphia and its Liberties. An address from some of the citizens of Philadelphia, to the United States in Congress, contains a number of assertions so contrary to  JULY ? 1783  what I have understood to be fact, that I cannot refrain from animadverting upon it; more especially as the evident tendency of the misrepresentation it contains is to persuade you, that you have done your duty in the union in a pre-eminent and distinguished manner. This is a flattering persuasion, more likely therefore to be admitted without any strict examination of the facts on which it is founded; and the conclusion, I am afraid, will be a relaxation of your exertions, from a false conception that you have already done comparatively too much.  This can redound neither to your honor, nor to that of the union. I trust therefore that I shall consult both, in holding out to you a true state of your conduct, in contradiction to the flattering but false one which is contained in the address. I trust too that your candour and good sense will prefer salutary admonition to delusive adulation. Deception is always dangerous, but most so when it affects the honor and interests of the people.  The address says, the citizens of Philadelphia have been \""free of their fortunes. The monthly return of taxes from Pennsylvania, of which the city and liberties form so great a part, has not been exceeded by any, and we wish they had been proportionably equalled by every State in the union. To which we may add the establishment of the bank, which has extended its usefulness to the public service, and acquired a permanency as effectual, and in some instances superior to those of older nations.\""  That you may judge how free you have been of your fortunes, and what proportion your contributions have borne to your means, it will be necessary to place before you those contributions, and those means. And as you have appealed to the monthly returns of taxes, to those returns, which are compleat for 1782, I shall appeal.  The requisition from you, for that year, was 1,012,868 Dol. The whole of your payments in the same was 107,923 or 1- 10th The requisition from the State of Rhode- Island, for the same year, was 179,041 The payments of that State were 37,642 or 1-5th  Of the exact truth of this statement you may be informed at the Office of Finance, or at the Treasury. As both these were more immediately accessible to you, than to any other citizens of the United States, it is somewhat surprizing that you should have held up to the world a boast, that your contributions had been exceeded by none--when it was so easily refutable, by an appeal to the records within your reach, and even under your eyes. From them it appears, that even the State of Rhode-Island, the abused and reprobated State of Rhode-Island, that State against which this very decent reflection in your address, \""We do not amuse the world with calling on Congress to do justice to the army, and to the creditors of America, and at the same time withhold the means by which that justice is to be fulfilled,\"" was principally intended, has doubled   the proportion of your payments, having furnished one-fifth of her quotas; and your State (of which the city and its liberties form so great apart) but one-tenth. Many of the other States, as Georgia, the two Carolina's, Virginia, New-Jersey, and New-York, have contributed so largely in specific supplies for the army, that, I am persuaded, if those were added to their money-payments, your proportion of contribution would be found among the lowest in the union.  But taking it upon the contribution more favourable to your pretentions, that of money, what foundation does it furnish for your vain-glorious boasting, that you have been free of your fortunes for the public service--or how does it warrant your arrogating superior merit to yourselves, by vilifying the rest of the union? Is the paying one hundred thousand dollars, when one million was required for the public service, being \""free of your fortunes?\"" Is paying a little more in money, and much less in specifics, than most of the other States, a just ground for pluming yourselves at their expence? Is the State that furnishes subsistence for the soldier, less meritorious than that which supplies money to purchase the subsistence? Or, does the profit accruing to individuals, through whose hands the money must pass to be converted into subsistence, stamp a preference on pecuniary to those of specific contributions?  So much for your contributions, which, compared either with what was required of you, or with the effectual supplies of other States, furnish certainly no real matter for claims of pre eminence, or public boasting.  But infinitely less will the foundation for these claims appear, when we measure your contributions with your means, compared with those of other States in the union. And I am sure you must accede to the fairness of this mode of adjusting the merits of a State, since it is an eternal rule of justice, that to whom much is given, from them much shall be required. The following estimate then will shew the sums that centered in Philadelphia in one year, from the residence of Congress in that city, which was an advantage enjoyed by no other State, and consequently an exclusive faculty of contribution. I have estimated every thing as low as possible, because the lowest estimate will shew you, that you have not contributed in proportion to your extraordinary means, and much less equivalent to the ordinary and extraordinary means together.  The estimate for one year stands thus:  Drawn to Philadelphia, from the other States, by their contributions to the United States, Dol. 313,031  Public money in specie put into the bank, 462,505  Clear profit on goods imported and supplied to other States, whose importations were stopt by the  enemy being in them; the prime cost supposed   650,000, and the profit two prices, 1,625,000 Profit on public bills on France, 148,568 Monies expended in Philadelphia by members of Congress, their officers, those necessarily  attending to do business with Congress, and their officers, foreign Ministers, &c. 194,642 2,743,746  These are some of your extraordinary means, for it is not possible to form any estimate of them all; and surely from these alone a great deal more might have been reasonably expected, before you could with any propriety boast of your having been \""free of your money.\"" I am sensible that the whole of what was drawn from the other States, in their quotas and imported on loan from Europe, though centered in Philadelphia, was not expended among its citizens, and therefore I am willing to allow any deduction on those sums, which any one better informed than myself may shew to be reasonable. Truth is my object, and a just estimate of your merits. To detract from these I would not willingly exaggerate a single dollar.  Nor were the ordinary means of raising your quota less eminently in your favour. To shew this let it be remembered, that for four years your State had not felt the ravaging hand of an army, or enemy, or an impress: That your militia had not been called, during that period, to serve out of the State, but the countrymen have been at uninterrupted liberty to cultivate their lands, and the citizens to pursue their trade: That your commerce flourished, your tradesmen prospered, and your citizens were enriched, beyond any former example in a similar period of time. The war, which was a burthen and calamity to other States, was to you a golden blessing, fertile of elegance and opulence.  As proof of this, let me remind you, that in one year your imports in goods amounted to one million of money: That, in one year, your flour shipped to the Havannah brought you upwards of half a million in specie: That your privateers brought in a multitude of most valuable prizes: That such was the enormous profit you derived from commerce, that you could afford to give as far as ten per cent per month for the use of money: That in fine we may say, without any exaggeration, that, in point of fortune, your tradesmen had become gentlemen, and your merchants princes.  Such were your means, and such your advantages, in 1782; compare them with your contributions, and see how amazingly they out-measure them--how little reason you have to boast, that you have been \""free of your fortunes,\"" or to arrogate pre-eminence in public merit. Superior to every State in the advantages arising from the residence of Congress--superior to most in the prosperity of your agriculture, your manufactures, and your commerce--even in monied contributions  you was inferior, by one half, to one State, viz. Rhode-Island, and in that of specifics inferior to almost every State. But the comparison (odious I confess comparisons are, but you have begun them) in the quotas of troops, will shew you to have been still more deficient in your duty to the union.  This estimate stands thus: States. Inhabitants. Quota of troops, 1782. New-Hampshire, 100,000 697 Massachusetts, 350,000 4326 Rhode-Island, 60,000 467 Connecticut, 200,000 2351 New-York, 200,000 1037 New-Jersey, 120,000 868 Pennsylvania, 300,000 1592 Delaware, 30,000 307 Maryland, 250,000 1604 Virginia, 400,000 949  North Carolina, 200,000 1005 Here you will perceive, that in proportionable contributions of men Massachusetts has almost trebled you. Rhode-Island, Connecticut, New-Jersey, and Delaware, have nearly doubled your quota. New-Hampshire and Maryland out-number you by one-third. New-York, and North-Carolina, under all their disadvantages, are equal; and that it is the single State of Virginia only you can pretend to have exceeded. You will permit us then to wish, in your own words, that Pennsylvania had \""proportionably equalled the other States,\"" in furnishing men to bring the war to an \""happy issue,\"" and that you had not amused the world, with boasting of your having \""made every exertion which principle could inspire, or fortitude support,\"" while you were so defective in the most material of all exertions.  But a review of the circumstances of the different States in 1782, will set your delinquency in a more just and strong light. Georgia and South-Carolina were under the ravaging hand of an enemy. North-Carolina was recovering from the desolation of two armies. Virginia was hardly emerged from two preceding years of devastation from an enemy, in part of the State, and a constant impress in the rest. Her militia had been drawn from the culture of her fields, to fight afar off, at Cambden, Guilford, King's Mountain, and the Cowpens. She had been exhausted, both of men, money and provisions, by almost the whole weight of the southern war in 1780. In the succeeding year a hostile army laid waste every thing before it. Our own army consumed all that could be seized, where the enemy did not come; her militia was on constant duty; her shores were continually plundered by the refugee barges; her fields were laid waste, or uncultivated; her commerce was entirely destroyed; and her paper, the only monied re  source she could have, was depreciated to absolute annihilation. So circumstanced, so exhausted by the burthen and devastation of war in her very bosom; so overwhelmed with accumulated calamities; and so deprived of all resources--it was not reasonable to expect contributions from her, either in men or money. It must be remembered too, that early in the war that State had the peculiar misfortune of having her chief commercial city burnt, which gave an irrecoverable blow to her commerce, and the various resources derivable from that. Next in the list stands Maryland, which was free from the inroads and injuries of war, and exerted herself accordingly. Delaware did its duty as to men, but was unpardonably deficient in money-contributions.We come now to Pennsylvania, in long and full possession of internal peace, agriculture, trade and commerce. It seemed among the other States like the land of promise, a land flowing with milk and honey; her cities enlarging, her inhabitants increasing in wealth, and her fields seeming to laugh and sing. Yet out of her abundance what did she contribute?--a handful of men, and one-tenth of her quota in money. This, when we appeal to facts, appears to be the prodigality with which you devoted your lives and fortunes to the support of the union. Continuing our review, we shall find New-Jersey, New-York and Connecticut, occasionally burthened with the maintenance of the army, or exposed to the depredations of the enemy. Yet those States did in the whole contribute as largely, in men and money, as the untouched and prosperous State of Pennsylvania.  Rhode-Island had been free from an enemy only since the arrival of the French troops; her capital having been a British post almost three years; her navigation chiefly destroyed; her manufactures, and the various branches of business depending on her foreign trade, entirely failing.(2) The most fertile parts of the State liable to daily ravages from the enemy, and many of her wealthy inhabitants retiring, and carrying off their property to other States for shelter, while those who remained were worn out with excessive military duty on the shores; yet so recently after such unparalleled sufferings, the State of Rhode-Island doubled, in proportion, your contributions. Massachusetts, though by no means possessed of your advantages, exceeded you more in her quota of men than she was inferior to you in her supply of money. But there is yet a fact, with regard to filling up her line, which will prove how greatly the exertions of Massachusetts transcended those of Pennsylvania. The fact is, that the bounties for raising their men amounted to 200 specie dollars a man, so that this service was an immediate expence to her of near half a million of dollars. This observation applies also with equal force in favour of Rhode-Island, on the scale of comparative merit. Whoever will examine into the State debt and taxes of Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, will find that in the former they treble those in the latter; an infallible  criterion of which has been most free of her fortunes, which has made the greatest exertions, has borne and must bear the greatest burthens, and which, though unboasting, deserves most praise. And if we consider too that the great source of wealth to Massachusetts, the fishery, was entirely stopt by the war, it will lighten still more the Pennsylvania scale. Permit me, gentlemen, to hope you are convinced, that the exertions of the other States, in support of the war, have at least been as you wished, proportionably equal to your own. I am happy to have had the means of shewing you your wishes were fulfilled.  But you assume a merit in the establishment of a bank in your city, and charge that institution as a service rendered by you to the United States; and yet in truth this establishment was a peculiar benefit to you, procured by the favour of Congress, and the use of the public money. When you would not fill up the subscription, so as to enable the bank to open agreeable to its charter, four hundred thousand dollars of the public money was put into the bank, which was to supply the place of the stock, and the bank opened almost two years before the original subscription was filled up. This deposit of public money was therefore the foundation-stone of your bank, from which you have derived so much reputation, and such eminent advantages.  And now, gentlemen, give me leave to advise you, when next you are inclined to make a parade of your merits, to be sure that they are real. You cannot but feel how unbecoming it is to assume merits that do not belong to you--how humiliating to be exposed as vain boasters. When too you are next inclined to draw comparisons, be pleased to remember they are invidious, if true; if false, odious. Let me exhort you to redeem your character, by doubling your exertions; and--let your pride pardon what your nature needs, the salutary caution of a friend. Reprinted from the Providence Gazette, September 6, 1783. This letter appeared under the following heading: \""To the Printer of the Providence Gazette. By giving a Place, in your next Gazette, to the following Strictures on the late Address to Congress, from some of the Citizens of Philadelphia and its Liberties, you will oblige An Old Customer.\""  1 Lee apparently composed this letter as a result of his work on a committee appointed July 23 to consider an address to Congress from more than 870 Philadelphia citizens vindicating Pennsylvania's support for Congress and the war effort, for which see Richard Peters to Thomas FitzSimons, July 23, 1783. Congress adopted the committee's bland and noncommital response to the address on July 28, for which see Elias Boudinot to Thomas Willing, July 30, and Willing ensured that the address, Congress' resolve, and Boudinot's letter were published in all five Philadelphia newspapers between August 4 and 9. Lee, who harbored animosity toward Pennsylvania and Robert Morris and strenuously resisted any attempt to return Congress to Philadelphia, undoubtedly felt that a far stronger response was in order. He could have composed this rebuttal at any time between his appointment to the committee in late July and mid-August, after the Philadelphia address appeared in the newspapers. Whether he attempted to have his \""Strictures\"" published in Philadelphia is not known nor is it clear whether he sent the essay directly to John Carter, publisher of the Providence Gazette, or to a New England colleague such as Jonathan Arnold or James Warren with instructions to solicit publication. It is clear, however, that Lee penned a continuation of the \""Strictures,\"" AUGUST 1, 1783  probably after Francis Bailey reprinted the original essay from the Providence Gazette in the Freeman's Journal (Philadelphia) on October 8, and sent it to Warren for publication, for which see Lee to Warren, October 16, 1783. 2 At this point the printer inserted a double dagger to which he keyed the following note: \""In the year 1774 the town of Newport sent to sea nearly 140 vessels, small and great. In 1782 that town did not send out more than 5 or 6. At the former period, there were in that town 21 distilleries, and 9 spermaceti-works; at the latter, not a single one of either.\""

  Sir, Princeton August the 1st. 1783  Our private letters of the 24th of June, 5th and 19th of July,(1) with the enclosures will inform your Excellency pretty generally of the subject to which they relate. We shall now state the reasons which induced Congress to remove from Philadelphia to this place. The report of the Committee of Congress which is herewith inclosed(2) states the general cause: but there are reasons not mentioned by the Committee which gave the meeting a very serious air. These we shall try to explain. From your general acquaintance with Civil History you must have observed that the cases are numerous in which armies have overturned the liberties of a nation whom they had been hired to defend. More than half of the Empires now on the face of the earth have been formed, not like ours by the choice of the people, but by the swords of a mutinous or victorious army. We had nothing to fear from the disposition of our army, provided they could have been paid; But we believe there never was an instance of an Army being kept together who were so ill paid as ours much less of their being disbanded without pay. Congress have long viewed the present as a dreadful crisis which must prove truly alarming to the peace & liberties of our Country, unless, effectual payment could be made to the Troops. The conduct of some of the States put it out of our power to borrow money & we need not add that the States have not enabled us by their own exertions to pay AUGUST 1, 1783  the army nor any other creditors. In the late address of Congress to the States you will see papers, by which You will observe, that a very dangerous flame was nearly kindled in the main army. It was happily put out or covered by the exertions of our General, whose conduct on that occasion will furnish one of the brightest parts of his History. Congress however had much reason to believe that the flame was suppressed not extinguished. In the barracks of Philadelphia there were two or three hundred Soldiers of the Pennsylvania Line, they had been employed as guards to the British Prisoners &c. Some of these Troops had formerly been concerned in a mutiny; and it was unfortunate that they were too near a great body of Citizens, many of whom were ill affected to the american government and many of them being public creditors hardly conducted with decency towards Congress, because the Interest of the Certificates was not paid lately as usual. Matters were circumstanced in this manner when Congress resolved to grant furloughs to the war-men or troops enlisted for the war: who had been equally clamorous about discharges & pay. Of the Maryland Line few of whom are natives of America, near two hundred arrived at the barracks of Philadelphia from Head quarters on their way home on the 12th of June: on the next day a paper was handed to Congress signed by Persons styling themselves a board of Serjeants making certain demands with which Congress could not possibly comply, expressly declareing that they would no longer be fed by promises and requiring an answer before night. Congress immediately desired the Secretary at War to take measures for preventing the progress of the mutiny in the barracks. On the next day the Maryland Troops took up their March: but one of their Officers before he left town mentioned it to a Member of Congress that he had reasons for saying the mutiny did not originate among the privates nor Serjeants. Congress had too much reason to believe this charge to be well founded. On the 19th of June a Letter was handed to Congress by the supreme executive Council of Pennsylvania which they had just received from Colonel Butler at Lancaster, in which he stated that the Troops under his command had mutiny'd and that near one hundred of them were on their way to Philadelphia under the command of their serjeants. It was clear from the dates & other circumstances, that the mutiny in Lancaster had happened in concert with that in Philadelphia. It was at the same time reported that the mutineers counted on being joined by Armands Corps who lay a little to the Westward of Lancaster, many of whom were foreigners together with Moylans dragoons and others. In this critical conjuncture Congress appointed a Committee and instructed them to confer with the Executive of Pennsylvania on the practicability of taking effectual measures to prevent the Mutineers from coming to Town. The Executive seemed to think it was best to let them come to town, where they  could do no harm. The Committee not well satisfied with this opinion sent out the assistant Secretary at War, who without force could not stop the progress of the Mutineers and on the 20th they arrived at the barracks. On the 2lst the troops from Lancaster supported as was expected by those from the barracks surrounded the State house. In the Committees report you have a pretty full detail of what followed. To say nothing of the extraordinary conduct of the Executive of Pennsylvania Congress considered the circumstances as very critical. Troops who had been discharged or furloughed were hourly coming to Philadelphia & joining the mutineers & we knew that they might be joined by many who were known to be seditious before any assistance could arrive from head quarters to check them. We expected however by an adjournment of Congress to another place we should give them such a sudden an[d] unexpected alarm as to disconcert their whole plans & thereby prevent any violent measures, as well as, that it would rouse the Supreme Executive of Pennsylvania to a sense of their duty. Congress was surrounded on Saturday but it was Tuesday afternoon that they adjourned, on the evening of that Day. The story of the adjournment was reported in the Barracks with these additions, that a large detachment from the main Army was in full march to town & the Jersey Militia ordered out. It was soon clear to the Officers who had fomented the mutiny that they should be disappointed in their plans. The Soldiers discovered that danger was at hand. On the next Day the Officers (Lieutenant Sullivan of the horse, a young Irishman & Captain Corbery deranged) escaped, and the soldiers submitted. It will certainly be admitted that the situation of Congress is not a very desireable one. They are sent from home to seek for lodgings in a place where they have neither controul nor jurisdiction, in a place too where they are hourly exposed to the importunities or insults of creditors whom they cannot pay and to the bayonets of a mutinous soldiery whom they cannot discharge. After all we shall count ourselves happy if by any measures, we can prevent the evils allways expected and attendant on the discharge of armies 'til our Constituents can feel their own independence & importance, their own national honor & safety, and adopt any means for supplying the public Treasury, the only measure by which disorders of this nature can be effectually prevented. On the whole we flatter ourselves your Excellency will think with us, that the respect we owe to the Sovereign State we have the honor to represent, required that we should leave a City in which protection was expressly refused us, even though there had not been other motives more closely connected with the public safety. We have the Honor to be &ca, Benjamin Hawkins Hugh Williamson  ""

  Dear Hannah Friday August 1. 1783. The question for adjourning from this place is at length brought before Congress. It was yesterday moved by Mr. Read of S Carolina in the words following:  \""Resolved that on the president shall adjourn Congress to meet at Philadelphia on there to continue until the last Monday in October next, at which time the president shall adjourn Congress to meet at Annapolis on the friday following unless Congress shall before that time have determined otherwise.\""(1)  He prefaced his motion with observing that when Congress adjourned from Philada. it was generally understood by the house & it was particularly, mentioned by the mover(2) and the members around him that it was only for a few days until the detachment from the army arrived to quell the mutineers; That had he not understood this to be the general sense of the house, he never would have consented to the adjournment. That every member must now be fully convinced that this was not a proper place for conducting public business; That even the members of Congress could not be provided with proper accommodations. That there were no conveniences for the Officers of Congress. That a minister was attending from the court of France, one was daily expected to arrive from Holland & others might be expected from other courts and here was no place for their reception or accommodation. That moreover the citizens of Philada & the people of that State were extremely uneasy at the removal. That he would not mention what he had heard & what he knew, but he greatly feared that declining any longer to return would endanger the Union, affect the finances & ruin the credit of the United states. He hoped therefore his motion would be seconded & meet the approbation of the house. He then sat down and a long silence ensued. I dare not trust myself in describing the countenances of some individuals during this interval of silence, or the various passions with which they were visibly actuated, notwithstanding their utmost care to conceal them. It was a sight worthy the notice of the Athenian, who had learned by careful observation to trace accurately the passions of the Soul by the lines of the Countenance and whose skill Plato, Zenophon and the rest of the disciples of Socrates admired, while their master bore witness to the truth of it. I will confess that had he fixed his Eyes on me while I was AUGUST 1, 1783  viewing the countenances of some, he would have seen a gush of indignation too visible to be concealed. At length Mr. McHenry of Maryland arose. He said he had looked round and waited to hear the motion seconded. It certainly deserved the attention of the house. In his opinion much depended on the determination of it, nothing less than the peace of a great & important state & perhaps that of the Union. That it was high time the subject should be taken into consideration. He therefore seconded the motion, & hoped it would be seriously considered before a vote was taken. Mr. Williamson moved to commit the motion; this was opposed. It was then moved to Assign a day for the consideration of it, this also met with Opposition and the debates continued till at last an adjournment was called for and agreed to, so that by that means the subject was put off till next day. It was curious to observe with what care the speakers endeavoured to conceal their sentiments and the votes they meant to give. I expect the subject will be resumed to day, but I question much whether they will come to a decision this week.(3) Adieu my dear Hannah. Take care of your health. I am with sincere affection, your loving husband, Cha Thomson [P.S.] Please to forward the enclosed. Mrs. M & family send their love to you. ""

  Dr. Sir. Princetown 2 Agt. 1783  I have had another opportunity to speak to the Minister.(1) The truth is your letter is lost, and I think it probable that no answer has been sent. To prevent [... or] other disapointment you will be pleased to send me a copy of it, when I undertake to procure an answer. The only capital business that has been done in Congress since my last, was the ratification of a treaty of commerce with the King of the Goths and Vandals, or the King of Sweden, as he is commonly stiled.(2) We are again reduced to 8 states, and I am yet without a colleague. Thursday the temper of the house was tryed by a motion which I seconded. It was to go back to Philadelphia, and if Congress should not agree to fix their place of residence by the last week in October, the president was to adjourn sometime in the week following to Annapolis. It was a considerable time under debate and renewed again yesterday without a decision.(3) This I thought best as it was only an experiment. AUGUST 2, 1783  The Council cannot as yet have the late Journals of Congress as I have not been able to get them. Pray what are your latest, that I may take them up where you want them. Yesterday a report of a committee upon the act of our State misapplying the money we had engaged to Congress, was under debate. It asserts the right of Congress, Censures the act, and the flagrant infringement of the confederation. I moved that the consideration of the report might be postponed till the delegates from Maryland could receive information from the legislature of the State respecting the subject matter of the same.(4) I made use of the occasion to shew by a number of instances the early and present disposition of the inhabitants to support the measures of Congress--and that the general tenor of the public acts manifested the same spirit and were directed to the same point. I ventured also to confirm these facts by a paragraph from one of your letters. I then deduced from the whole that it must have been a case of the last necessity that produced the act--and that it would be precipitate to adopt the report before the delegates could have an opportunity of hearing from the legislature the reasons for the act--that they might be such as to satisfy the house of the necessity and perhaps propriety of the infringement. I had in view to put the affair in such a train as might insure to the state a credit for the money she may advance under the act. This I hope may be effected by proper management and coolness (as the house are disposed to the spirit of the motion) by the legislatures instructing their delegates to declare to Congress the alarming situation which forced them into the measure, and that they even had and still have, the strongest inclination to do everything in their power to support and maintain inviolate the confederation. You will confess I had a delicate task in this question--to vindicate in Congress what I condemned in the Senate. With great regard [I am] Dr. Sir your Excellency's hble st. James McHenry. [P.S.] Don't forget that you promised to inliven me now and then in these dull regions of politics. ""

I wish I could go home with you; my inclination to be at home is very strong, but I feel a reluctance at going immediately on several accounts. I wish to have my return appear not as the effect of resentment or chagrin, but rather, as is the truth, from a desire of enjoying domestic quiet, and attending to my own private concerns. I am desirous of seeing some important points which are on the Carpet adjusted, and of possessing Mr. G____(2) with a knowledge of men and measures. I want also to hear from London in answer to a letter I sent Mr. F____(3) by the Robin-Hood, in which I mentioned the matter which you and I both think of so much importance to the public. I gave him liberty to make such use of the letter as he might think eligible, so that he did not commit me. I stated the matter to him in such a manner that I think he will conceive it of importance to communicate it to certain persons, and I expect their attention will be thereby engaged to the subject, and that measures will be taken in consequence to secure the Object. No particular advantages will result in a pecuniary way that I can see from my being at home. I shall exchange a disagreeable for an agreeable situation, and encrease my own private enjoyment, by going home, but whether I ought to indulge myself immediately, is a matter I am not fully decided upon as yet. I shall think of it a few days after Mr. G____ arrives, and advise you. Sir Guy's(4) reasons for the neglect of the British to their interest in this Country, are I suspect the true ones; but they certainly have very wrong Ideas of the matter. While we remain in an unsettled state, it is of the more importance to them to be represented; especially if the cause of our fluctuations is considered; lest we should finally settle down with a Government totally devoted to the French, or remain in confusion 'till a dissolution of the Union shall take place, and seperate alliances be formed by the several states with different powers in Europe; in which case some of the Southern States, if not all of them, will certainly be connected with France. To determine this point the interests of the parties should be closely attended to; if we are left wholly to ourselves, and our feelings and inclinations are to direct us, it cannot be doubted but our connexion with Britain will be renewed in the commercial way--let this again become intimate and the policy of Britain be of the conciliatory kind, a closer connexion and perhaps of more importance will certainly result therefrom. Our habits, language, and every circumstance will lead to it, and Britain will not only avail herself of the advantage AUGUST 5, 1783  of our trade, but may hereafter have an Ally that from union of interests &c., will be very closely attached to her, and be a great security to her dominions: and these advantages may be encreased or decreased, rendered permanent or uncertain, and be sooner or later enjoyed, by the kind of Government established here, and the men who are to direct our affairs. The French certainly have this view of the matter, and their whole conduct towards us has been correspondent thereto. Their first object was to place us by the peace, in a confined precarious situation, with Europeans close on our borders on every side, and without the means of extending our trade, or becoming powerful or wealthy--thus situated they could have fomented divisions and strife between us and our neighbours at their pleasure; and being a poor defenceless people, we should have learned to look up to them for protection against the very storms they might think fit to bring upon us to secure our dependence on themselves. With these Ideas did they negociate at the treaty, and for this purpose did they insert themselves into all our councils. They intended by having an influence in them, to have given such a form to our Government, as to have had it composed of such men, as in the situation before mentioned, could not fail of securing our dependence on them. But the watchfulness of Jay and Adams, the attention of Britain to her own interest, and the forwardness of Vergennes, defeated their views and lost them the first and the great Object.(5) Their present plan I suppose is to keep up high disputes in each State, and between the States, to prevent any connection between us and Britain, and possibly to bring about a dissolution of the Union: for since they cannot keep us so dependent on themselves as to promise a complete bar to an intimate connection with Britain, and its probable that our weight may at some future day be thrown into the scale of their most dangerous Enemy, it is very important to them to reduce that weight as much as possible. You accordingly find them deeply interested and active in the questions as to Commutation and Refugees, &ca, fomenting parties as much as possible--beside, by dividing us and keeping us in as great confusion as they can, the evil apprehended of our uniting with Britain, is not only put off, but there is a chance of our being so very intemperate as to violate in a flagrant manner the Treaty of peace, of renewing our quarrel with Britain, and loosing all the advantages we have gained by the peace. And should it be carried so far as to produce a dissolution, the Continent may perhaps be divided into two Governments, one of which will probably be very intimately connected with and dependent upon them. The letter of Marbois, the conduct of Vergennes during the negociations, the language of their tools, and the whole tenor of their present conduct, evidence that such are their present views: and I confess that I think  they are right; their interest lies in that road, and it is wisdom in them to pursue it. But the interest of Britain and America is different: it is their business to pursue a direct opposite course, and in opposing the views of France, I think their interests are clearly united. The sooner we are reconciled, and all Old things done away, the better for us both.(6) If our divisions were healed, our Governments in the States and the fOEderal Government well settled, the channels of trade opened under proper regulations, and every question that can keep up the temper of the people and prevent a thorough conciliation removed; then might we as a people be happy, our commerce flourish, and Britain by a right policy secure to herself the advantages ultimately of all our trade. She would then be sure of a powerful Ally, attached to her by every circumstance that can secure its utility and duration; an Ally which after a few years, would have every motive to take side with her in case of a rupture with France, and whose weight would be decisive in either scale. In my mind it is clear that America by her attachment to either France or Britain, will determine which of them is to be superior. That power (I mean of those two) which has America for its Ally, will hereafter give law to Europe; and if Britain neglects too long an attention to this matter, there is great reason to apprehend that France will secure the connection to herself; at least it will daily grow more and more difficult for Britain to secure so important an object. The French are now making impressions in every State very injurious to Britain, and such as will eventually be highly detrimental to us, by rendering that connection, which is essential to our interest, more difficult, if not impracticable. The same policy that led the French to assist us in completing our Independence, will induce them to prevent, if they can, any friendly connection between us and Britain; and if they cannot effect that, they will render our connection as precarious, and as unimportant to her as possible. Their interest urged them to seperate us from Britain, not with a desire of placing us in a better situation, but in order to weaken her. The reduction of the power of Britain, was their chief, if not their only object in assisting us, and surely the more perfect that seperation is made, the more completely will they effect their views. It must therefore be very imprudent in Britain to leave to them an exclusive field of action; to suffer them without any check, any opposition, to practice their intrigues on this people, and to give them an opportunity of making such impressions, as may prove affectual bars to any future connections between us and her. Sound policy, and a regard to her own interest, will urge Britain to have an Envoy of great abilities, and one who has some share of the confidence of America, constantly attending upon Congress. She ought also to have her Agents in every large Town, in every legisla-  ture. They had better be Americans than any others; men whose characters stand fair with the people; of known integrity and abilities: men who will urge and support such measures as are conducive to the interests of both countries, and whose knowledge of both will insure their pursuing the true interest of both. She ought never to employ men of doubtful Characters; more especially any of the Tories or Refugees. They should be men who will not be tools, nor pretend to push the interest of Britain beyond that point where it ceases to coincide with that of America. It is sufficient for her purpose that it be urged to that extent: this will secure to her every important advantage, and while she acts on such principles, the connection will surely be firm and permanent, and the advantages resulting therefrom must be very extensive, & lasting. In this way I think Britain may defeat the views of France, she may acquire as much influence in America as she ought to have, and find the Country again to be a great source of wealth and strength to her. But if she neglects these means, France will probably supplant her. If she employs improper persons it will be to no good purpose. If she attempts by art and intrigue again to make us dependent on her as a people, and to direct our Councils, she will rouse our jealousy, the alarm will be sounded, and every substantial advantage she might otherwise derive from a proper, an intimate connection with us, will be for ever lost. These are my Ideas, in the rough, of the interest of Britain &c. I am so well satisfied of the union of the interests of Britain and America, that I should take great pleasure, if my situation would allow of it, and my property was such as I lately possessed, in devoting a little more time to politicks, in counteracting the insidious conduct of France, and promoting that intercourse between us and Britain which would greatly benefit both Countries. But with this season I shall finish my political carreer, and devote myself to the support of my family, and the society of a few friends. Congress yet remain here, and that in opposition to the utmost exertions of all the great men and their tools. Their being here I consider as a very happy affair for America. The members act with much more independence than they ever did or will do in Philadelphia. I have carried some motions here, which but one man would support me in when in Philadelphia. Things seem to be working right: the great man(7) and his agents are very uneasy, they see their influence daily declining; and I have great hope that we shall yet catch him on the hop, and perhaps get rid of him. I wish exceedingly to see our Councils freed from his influence, to see Congress acting an Independent and an honorable part: this cannot be while he remains in Office. By such a dismission we should stand a much fairer chance of having our Government settled on right principles: much however  would then depend on contingencies. While we remain as at present nothing good can turn up, or if it should we cannot avail ourselves of it. The spiders web is so nearly finished, so many of our members have got entangled in it, and so artful are the ManOEuvres made use of to draw others into it, that I see no way of getting rid of the danger, of shaking off the fetters, but that of destroying him who has the management and has placed it at his will. I fear you have expressed yourself too freely in New York, tho' I agree with you that proper communications may be useful. You must take care not to commit me nor yourself in too great a degree. If I return through New York, I should have no objection to a conversation with Sir Guy,(8) but I feel a reluctance in subjecting myself to paroles &c; they seem derogatory, and do not accord very much with my Ideas of propriety. Should the definitive treaty arrive before I go, those obstructions will be removed, and I shall probably return that way. But I should imagine that he cannot be ignorant of our situation, and the state of our political affairs. The situation of America, of Britain and of France, is in my opinion very critical and important; the future safety and importance of each of them, will very much depend on the politicks of the present day; it behoves them respectively to be extremely cautious and attentive. America may certainly by a right line of policy, be courted by all the European powers, and lay the sure foundation of a great empire. She ought to keep herself at a proper distance from them all, to avoid their cabals and intrigues, to have no favorites, no particular attachments of an extensive and exclusive nature, to suffer no foreign influence to Effect her Councils, to avoid all the luxurious expences of those courts, and by promoting habits of rigid Oeconomy, to preserve as far as possible the virtue and Jealousy of her subjects. If a contrary conduct is pursued by her for a few years, ambition and avarice will encrease rapidly, her Councils will be distracted, her public affairs debauched, the States be at variance with each other, and the country very soon will be enslaved. Britain is now reduced very much; her most dangerous rival has become very powerful, and will probably be encreasing in power; she may notwithstanding recover by degrees her former importance, at least so far as to be upon an equality with France. Let her practice a rigid Oeconomy, attend chiefly to her Navy; let her policy be such as to conciliate this Country, and every encouragement given to our commerce and her own; let an intimate and a friendly intercourse with America be promoted by her; she will then find her trades to revive, her riches to encrease, the means of encreasing her Navy easy and within her power. She will be sure of having America for her ally in many cases, and her friend in all ruptures with European powers. Our interest and our feelings will insure to her thus much, the danger   will be on our side, of our growing too much attached to her, and suffering her to gain too great ascendancy over us. But if she for any length of time neglects such policy, all possible means of her becoming even an equal with France will in my opinion be lost; she must then, instead of giving law to Europe, submit to receive it from her neighbours. I wish not to see her as formidable as in 1775, it is not for our interest, nor her own happiness that she should be so, but I wish her to be at least equal to the Bourbons. France is now a formidable power, her situation is such that if she could manage America, and make this Country to subserve her purposes; if she could gain such an influence here as to direct our Councils for any length of time, she would infallibly become the great arbiter of Europe: Britain would then most certainly lose all chance of again becoming her equal. But she has great obstacles in her way: our old habits and Ideas are against her: our leading men are in general opposed to her; scarce any circumstance is in her favor; and yet I think her chance the best of them. The French are so attentive to their interest, so indefatigable in the pursuit of it, they are so very expert at intrigue, can so happily accommodate themselves to their situation, so adapt themselves to those whom they mean to captivate, and they have already got such hold of great numbers in this Country, that I fear they will eventually succeed, and make America dependent in a great degree on France. Should this happen, adieu America, farewell Britain, your Suns will then be set never more to rise in any day. My greatest hope is, that confident of success they may play too bold a game, and rouse the fears and jealousy of our Country. I think that disposition is now very apparent; may they indulge it! I wish them to attempt us by Storm rather than regular approaches. But I am running away I know not where; these matters have got such hold of my mind, that when I sit down to write or talk about them, I know not where to stop. When G[erry] returns from Philadelphia, I shall write you my mind about returning. Farewell! Yours, &c. ""

  Sir, Little Creek 5th August 1783  I take the liberty to inclose my account against the state for attendance in Congress, balance £118.0.0, for which I pray your Excellency's drafts on the State Treasurer--one for £45. which I mean to advance Dr. Tilton on his setting out to take a seat in Congress(1)--the other for £73.0.0 which I wish to pass on account of my own & Mr. Irons's Taxes for the current year. I am so thoroughly convinced of the necessity of keeping up a Representation in Congress, that I would do any thing in my power to forward it. This makes me anxious to engage Dr. Tilton in the service, because he would be a stationary Member, and the other Delegates might serve in turns as would best suit their convenience. The Doctor's only objection is the uncertainty of regular supplies. He says he has nothing of his own that he can command, and he conceives that he would make but a scurvy figure in a strange place, without money in his Pocket. This obliges him to be so particular in stipulating for regular supplies. He would run the risk of money coming into the Treasury, but he wishes the State Treasurer would give him some assurance that no other demand shall supercede his, but that your Excellency's drafts, in his favor, shall be punctually paid, on demand, if there is Money in the Treasury, or, what would be more agreeable to him, that the money shall be placed in the hands of some Gentleman, in Philadelphia, upon whom he might call, or draw, for his monthly supplies. If the State Treasurer will agree to this, and will take the trouble of signifying the same to the Doctor, he can set out at any time in three days notice. I must beg your Excellency will interest yourself in this business, and procure the Doctor a speedy answer, with such encouragement as the State Treasurer can give. My absence at this Season of the year would be inconvenient to my private affairs, and disagreeable to my Family, yet when I consider the Ratification of the Definitive Treaty--the subject of the back Lands, and the settlement of a peace establishment, as matters of high concern, in which this State ought to have a voice; I confess, if the Doctor agrees to take a Seat in Congress, I shall not be able to refuse my attendance for a short time, untill I can be relieved by Mr. Bedford. AUGUST 5, 1783  I am, with great esteem & regard, Sir, your Excellency's most obedient and most hble Servant, E. McComb. ""

I rather suppose that no question will he taken when the probability of a negative is fully discovered; though it will be pushed by those who wish to multiply obsticles to a removal South of the Delaware. The arrival of the definitive Treaty at N. Y. which my last represented as probable, has sunk into a general disbelief.

  Dear Sir Princeton 7th August 1783.  I am this minute favoured with your Letter of 1st instant by the Post. Some delay seems always unluckily to attend our correspondence. You AUGUST 7, 1783  ask me what I think of your Addresses. This surprizes me much, as we have only seen one Address from Philadelphia; that which was written by Mr. Paine. From your Letter I should suppose that another Address had been sent: if so, it must have been suppressed.(1) If there has been any Jockeying, it may be proper to trace it. Paine sent me a Copy of his Address, while it was in Embryo. I gave him my sentiments fully on it,(2) before it was presented, which have offended him. There was nothing, either in the matter or composition to recommend it. But the number of respectable names annexed to it were deserving of attention. My opinion was, & is, that Congress had no business to enter into a discussion of the points contained in the Address; nor to tell the subscribers of it that we did not leave Philadelphia because the Citizens had not fought the Common Enemy, paid Taxes, or erected a Bank. My opinion was also, & it appeared to be the unanimous desire of Congress, that a very civil answer should be returned. I had the honour of being on the Committee to prepare one;(3) & I hope it meets with your approbation, as it is exactly conformable to my sentiments. I most sincerely wish that Congress could return to Philadelphia consistently with their duty to their Constitutents, and themselves. And I am persuaded you must agree with me in thinking, after what has happened, that it would be highly improper for them to do it until satisfactory assurances shall be given of protection, & safety. I distinguish between the Citizens of the State of Pennsylvania & their Executive Council. The latter appear to me at present, to be highly culpable alone. When the Legislature meet, if they do not explicitly condemn their conduct, my opinion will be altered. We are told here by certain Partizans, that the Council have prepared a state of the Case to be laid before the Legislature, in which the facts contained in the Report of the Committee of Congress, are contradicted. This is a measure, to which I always supposed a certain piddling Genius (4) would have recourse. And his refusing to enter into a written correspondence with the Committee,(5) during the conference, justified the supposition. Pray let me know your sentiments respecting these matters, & what you think the Assembly will do when they meet. Should a certain party spirit prevail in the House, & the Council escape without censure, I am of opinion that it will produce most mischievous consequences. I sent Mr. Bailey about a fortnight ago an Address from the three Battalions of Militia, immediately in the neighbourhood of this place; but he has not thought proper to print it.(6) I wish you would call on him, & get it printed either in his paper, or some other; but do not let him know from whom it came. I am Dr. Sr. with great regard, Your most obt. Servant. [P.S.] One of your former Letters gave me reason to think that the Militia of Philada. would have vindicated themselves against the aspersions thrown on them, as related in the Report of the Committee of   Congress.(7) If they have, we know nothing of it here. I have not seen the Abbe Robin's Remarks, & should be obliged to you if you would send them to me.(8) ""

  Dear sir, Princeton 8th Augt 1783 A few days ago Mr. Bain calld on me in his Way from Rh. Island. His AUGUST 8, 1783  Business to Philada it seems to attend the Tryal of an Admiralty appeal from the condemnation of the Schooner Speedwell. Some days before Mr Bain's arrival I had written a Letter which I delivered him for you.(1) I cannot think that Mr. Bains continuing at Philada could be necessary till the Tryal which may not come on for weeks after the Beginning of the Session. I could not even advise him what Lawyer he should retain. Your Brother last Year retained Mr Willson in an appeal from Newbern; was the Case one of my own I would full as soon employ Mr Lewis, who I think studies his Causes more diligently, & sticks to them very successfully. In a dangerous and valuable Case I should employ one of those Gentlemen and some Auxiliary. I confess that from the Papers I have seen (and I understand that you have seen a Copy of the Same Papers) I augur ill of the Cause. The Proofs on Record that have been in the Court are very suspicious if not direct to the Point. Wherefore if you mean to prosecute this appeal with Effect I think it will be incumbent on you to shew. How did it happen that a Letter was on board the Schooner signed by Campbell representing that she was bound for New York on a Trade with the Enemy. Perhaps the Letter gives the Schooner another Name than that in the Register but it describes her otherwise and your Acct. Ct. if I remember well mentions her as the Property of Mr Campbel. How did the other Letter signed by Touton come on board which also describes the Schooner and declares her Destination for N York. How did those Letters come to be torn? The British Officers might have had Letters and have torn them, but they had no business for your Acct of the Outfit & Cargo or the a/c nor should they have torn it. Why was a Vessel of such value man'd by two Officers & two private Seamen only for so I think it appears. Why was she so near the Land! Tho I think this the weakest objection against her. For that may have been the safest Rout to shun Cruizers. It does not seem to me that Mr Bain is a correct and clear Hand at telling a Story. If the Story is really a sound one and has a good Bottom it will bear a much cleaner Explanation than any that I have yet heard. I wish yourself or your Brother William would undertake to give me the History of this Adventure including such Circumstances as will explain all the difficulties I have proposed. I have mentioned them because I think the Court seems to have leant on them in the Condemnation. If you should be coming to the Northward yourself before the Tryal the Trouble of such a long Letter will be saved because you will be able in person to explain the Cause to the Lawyer. I have to repeat, if by chance I mentioned it before, that this cause will require being well nursed and that some new Evidence be produced or new Light cast on the Subject if you would set aside the Verdict of the Court below. I have stated candidly where I think the Case labours, in order that you, if possible, may relieve it. I have the Honor to be, Dr Sir, your obedt hble Servt, Hu Williamson  ""

  Dear Sir, Sunday Aug. 10. 1783  I saw doctr. Rush to day, He told me the Council has prepared their state of matters to be laid before the Assembly.(1) He says it differs in some very material points from the report of the committee; He has seen and read it, but could not point out the particular facts in which it differs from the report of the committee. From what I could collect several have seen & read it, for he says good judges who have perused AUGUST 10, 1783  it with candour and coolness think that the honour of C will suffer by the publication of this state. It is drawn up he says in very mild language and with great respect for Congress, it is attested in the usual form in the name & in behalf of Council & accompanied with documents to support the facts as stated. He farther says that the State in general will espouse the side of Council. You know the man and can make proper allowances; but I confess I have some apprehensions that he is not altogether mistaken. If the state of facts as made by Council differs in any material points from the report of the Comee. Congress will be in a delicate situation, for they have grounded the propriety of their conduct & their justification on that report and the comee who made it are gone; and even if they were present I do not see what steps they could take to vindicate & support their report; They could only assert or deny; And if the Council assert or deny the contrary, it will be 9 or 10 against two. A public body against two individual members of C. Is this a situation for the representative Soveringnty of the US? I have reason to think that Some persons, who have no great cordiality for Congress or the Union wish that C may come to no determination respecting their return until this paper is published. I wish they may not be gratified. Sir F Bacon who indulged many singular opinions seems to think that the proverbs of Solomon were chiefly designed to be lessons of policy & that a statesman might reap great advantage by meditating on the Aphorism or proverb \""the beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water, therefore leave off contention before it be meddled with.\""(2) But Solomon was a fool and Bacon an Ass compared to the wise men of Gotham.

  Sir. Princeton August 11th. 1783. Your Letter to the President of Congress, on the subject of Monies lent to the Continent, and issuing certificates for the interest due thereon; had been taken up previous to my arrival, and reffered to the Financier: his report has been presented to Congress, and refferred to a Committee of that body.(1) From the comp[l]ection of Mr Morrises report, he does not seem fully to approve of the arrangment which would be agreeable to the wish of New-Hampshire; but as no debate hath taken place in Congress on the subject, I can not give any information what weight his opinion will have on the decision of the matter when the Committee make their report, I shall do all in my power to obtain a determination agreeable to the State I have the Honour to represent. Rhode Island seems still opposed to the impost arranged & recommended by Congress, and probably will not come into that measure. Should this be the case, other means must be devised, if indeed they can be devised, for restoring Continental credit, and giving public Creditors confidence in the plighted faith of Congress. No official account is yet arrived of the definitive treaty being signed, neither hath any other matter transpired, worth the communicating to your Honor. I must beg the favor that you will write to me by every oppertunity, and communicate whatever may enable me to serve the State I have the Honor to represent.

  My dear General. Princetown 11 Augt. 1783. I am just now honord with your letter of the 6th.(1) You have indeed gone over a great deal of ground in a very short time. The first motive for bringing you here was to get you out of a disagreeable situation, to one less disagreeable. The second was to get  AUGUST 11, 1783  your assistance and advice in the arrangements for peace. It may be necessary besides to consult you respecting promotions, and on a variety of military subjects. I believe, on the whole, that your being near Congress will be a public good. I send you the address to be made you from the chair which will serve to explain the intentions of Congress.(2) Mrs. Berrian has offered her house which will be engaged for your reception. As there is no absolute necessity for your immediate attendance you may prepare at leisure for your removal.

  My Dear Sir Philada. Aug. 11th. 1783. At the date of my letter in April(1) I expected to have had the pleasure by this time of being with you in Virginia. My disappointment has proceeded from several dilatory circumstances on which I had not calculated. <<One of them was the uncertain state into which the object I was then pursuing has been brought by one of those incidents to which such affairs are liable. The result has rendered the time of my return to Virga. less material, as the necessity of my visiting the State of N. Y. no longer exists. It would be improper by this communication to send particular explanations, and perhaps needless to trouble you with them at any time. An alliance of [...] is in general most inexpedient for both parties to them. For myself a delicacy to female character will [...](2) under any [...] which may carry both, as the danger of being reminded of their Troubles [sc...](3) from a profession of indifference at what has happened. I regret [least?...](4) a more propitious turn of fortune.> My journey to Virga. tho' still somewhat contingent in point of time cannot now be very long postponed. I need not I trust renew my assurances that it will not finally stop on this side of Monticello. The reserve of our foreign Ministers still leaves us the sport of misinformations concerning the def. Treaty. We all thought a little time ago that it had certainly arrived at N. York. This opinion however has become extinct, and we are thrown back on the newspaper evidence AUGUST 11, 1783  which as usual is full of contradictions. The probability seems to be that the delay arises from discussions with the Dutch. Mr. Dana has been sorely disappointed in the event of his announcing himself to the Court of ______.(5) His written communications obtain verbal answers only & these hold up the Mediation to which the Empress with the Emperor of G____y have been invited as a bar to any overt transaction with the U.S. and even suggest the necessity of new powers from the latter of a date subsequent to the acknowledgment of their sovereignty by G. B. Having not seen the letters from Mr. Dana myself, I give this idea of them at second hand, remarking at the same time that it has been taken from such passages only as were not in Cypher; the latter being not yet translated. Congs. remain at Princeton utterly undecided both as to their ultimate seat and their intermediate residence. Very little business of moment has been yet done at the new Metropolis, except a ratification of the Treaty with Sweeden. In particular nothing has been done as to a foreign establishment. With regard to an internal peace establishment, though it has been treated with less inattention, it has undergone little discussion. The Commander [in] chief has been invited to Princeton with a view to obtain his advice [&] sanction to the military branches of it, and is every day expected [t]here.(6) The Budget of Congs. is likely to have the fate of many of their other propositions to the States. Delaware is the only one among those which have bestowed a consideration on it that has acceded in toto. Several Legislatures have adjourned without giving even that mark of their condescension. In the Southern States a jealousy of Congressional usurpations is likely to be the bane of the system: in the Eastern an aversion to the half-pay provided for by it. New Jersey & Maryland have adopted the impost, the other funds recommended being passed for one year only by one of these States, and postponed by the other. Pa. has hitherto been friendly to liberal and fOEderal ideas and will continue so, unless the late jar with Congs. sd. give a wrong biass of which there is some danger. Masts. has in the election of delegates for the ensuing year stigmatized the concurrence of those now in place, in the provision for half-pay, by substituting a new representation; and has sent a Memorial to Congs. which I am told is pregnant with the most penurious ideas not only on that subject but on several others which concern the national honor & dignity.(7) This picture of our affairs is not a flattering one; but we have been witnesses of so many cases in which evils & errors have been the parents of their own remedy, that we can not but view it with the consolations of hope. Remind Miss Patsy of my affection for her & be assured that I am Dr Sir, Yr. Sincere friend. J. Madison Jr.  ""

Had the paper been mislaid or even lost I trust the candour of the house would have found a sufficient apology in the time when it was delivered in, the circumstances which immediately followed, the sudden and precipitate removal of the papers and the derangement that necessarily took place in the Office.

The Resolution of Congress requested by your Excellency was forwarded several days since,(2) but it cannot answer your expectations. Congress wished to have your Excellency's personal aid at forming the peace arrangement whenever that Report was called up; but your disagreeable situation arising from the unexpected and unaccountable delay of the definitive treaty, hastened the measure of requesting your Excellency's attendance, that you might, by a change of place, be in some measure relieved from the inconveniencies attending your present local situation. However Congress have instructed me to inform your Excellency, that it is their wish that you would make your attendance entirely agreeable to your own conveniency, unless you hear further from them.(3) They have directed a House and standing Furniture to be taken for your Excellency within three or four miles of this place, in case it should be agreeable for you to remain here a few weeks; but they by no means wish to hurry you in your Journey, unless the Definitive Treaty should suddenly arrive, of which I shall do myself the honor of giving you the earliest intelligence. I have no doubt, from very good information, that the substance of the Treaty, if not an authenticated copy, is in New York, tho' sent previous to the ratification, which, I suppose, is delayed to give Sir Guy all the time that can be conveniently done.

  Dear Sir Princeton 12th August 1783 I received your friendly Letter of the 20th of July,(1) but not till yesterday. Where it has been detained so long I am at a Loss to conceive. When I passed near your neighbourhood lately it was not in my way to Congress, but on some preparatory business; which was necessarily to be transacted before I coud leave my Family and my Journey was hastened on the Day to which you allude by a preengagement to dine at Head quarters. Your kind attention in returning home to meet me is a proof of your politeness which deserves my Thanks. AUGUST 12. 1783  Before I take up the interesting Subject of your Letter I beg leave to inform you that I submitted to attend Congress this Summer with the utmost Reluctance, and from necessity only. I wished to devote my Time and Attention to my Fellow sufferers and Fellow Citizens and in assisting in those preparatory Deliberations which our common Interest and Happiness requires. But there was no alternative--unless I relinquished an object so near to my Heart. There woud have been no Representation from our State--at a Period too when the Peace Arrangement, and the Security of our civil and military Creditors call for the United wisdom of our country to say nothing of those important Regulations which respect our Intercourse with & our Connections with foreign Nations. I have not with me the Law which constitutes the great Council which, in the first Instance, is to regulate the police of the Southern District of our State: but confiding in your Judgement that their powers are competent I can safely Announce that their wishes must lead them to every Exertion in favour of Citizens who have hazarded and suffered every thing in the common Cause. What then shoud hinder our stating the Grievances under which we must too probably Labour with the Firmness becoming Freemen and why should we doubt of receiving every support which we ought to ask or they to grant? I will not entertain a suspicion but that the regular and legal way which you have in Contemplation will prove effectual. If Violence should be recurred to, I should fear with you Consequences as painful as the Calamities of any period of the war. I find that the Meeting you mention has taken place and that you are one of the Committee; the Resolutions not published; and from the nature of the subject I can conjecture Reasons to justify the Reserve. If there is no impropriety I shall be glad to be informed of the Views & Sentiments which prevailed in that interesting Conference. We hear nothing of the definitive Treaty: No Intelligence from our Ministers, nor from Individuals; No Conjecture even from a publick print; which in the least relieves our Solicitude on Account of the Detention of the Capital portion of our State. Is this not mysterious and even alarming. I confess it is a point on which I am become extremely troubled for I feel with you that months now are more tedious than the most critical Years of our arduous Conflict; and is it to be wondered at when we alone of the whole federal Union are still in the painful Situation of Exiles and can fix no Period for our return to our beloved Home. I hope you still hold your Resolution to visit us at this place as I wish much to converse with you on the State of our internal politics. I did not delay a moment in transmitting your Letter to the Financier who remains at Philadelphia. AUGUST 12, 1783  Be pleased to Present my respectful Compliments to Mrs. Malcolm and our Friends in your neighbourhood, and believe that there is no Man more sincerely disposed to serve and oblige all his suffering Fellow Citizens who have stood forth in the defence of our Liberties than, Dear Sir, Your most obedient & very humble Servant, Jas.

  Dear Sir Philada. Aug. 12. 1783. The arrival of yesterday's mail has not enabled me to acknowledge the rect. of a favor, perhaps the post office may be again in fault.(1) Our late belief of the arrival of the Defin. Treaty at N. York has become utterly extinct. From the tenor of the Newspapers the delay seems to be the effect of discussions with the Dutch. The inclosed letter from our friend Hawkins provides for the article of Russian intelligence.1 I understand from Mr. Mercer who is here on business as well as myself that Mr. Dana's despatches were in part undecypher'd when Mr. Hawkin's transcript was made. The Legislature of Masts. have sent a Memorial to Congress wearing a very unpropitious aspect on the grant of 1/2 pay to the army and in other respects breathing a penurious spirit which if indulged will be fatal to every establishment that requires expence. They profess great poverty, and have declined any decision on the Revenue propositions of Congs. Rhode Island did not even bestow a consideration on them. Mr. H----l (2) from the latter State after being informed of the course taken by Va. said that her backwardness very much emboldened the States that were disinclined to a Genl. Revenue. Congs. have voted Genl. W. an elegant Bronze Statue. He has been invited to Princeton as well to relieve him from the tedium which he suffers on the North River as to make use of his Counsel in digesting a peace Establishmt. We shall probably be reinforced by Mr. Jones in a few days.(3) I shall give you notice when my departure will make it proper for your correspondence to be discontinued. ""

As we are wholly unacquainted with the Principles on which Mrs. DeLancey's property is supposed to be sequestered, we coud give Mr. Izard no other satisfaction than a promise to transmit her Case to your Excellency, and an assurance of your inflexible Regard to Justice, good order and the publick Faith. We think it our Duty to put the Subject into such a Train of Enquiry as will vindicate the Honour of the State and enable us to answer Complaints and re- AUGUST 13, 1783  move Prejudices. If there is any Law by which her Property is forfeited, or her Rights of Citizenship taken away, it will have its Operation: but if she is evicted by Violence and entitled to Protection, we have no doubt but her grievances will be heard and as far as possible redressed. Can it be thought a Crime deserving the Penalties of Confiscation, or any high Degree of public Indignation, that a Widow in the Decline of Life retired from the midst of the most active scenes of War to a place of Safety. In this Light is Mrs. DeLancey's Case represented and this she insists is her only offence. We have no Account of the definitive Treaty.

  Dear sir. Princeton, 14th Aug., 1783.  I have not been honor'd with a line from you (except in your public capacity) since I did myself the pleasure of addressing you last.(1)  The definitive treaty is not yet come to hand, neither have we any accounts, that makes it certain that it is yet finished, notwithstanding we are in daily expectation of it.  General Washington having signified to Congress, that his present situation was not very agreeable, while waiting for the definitive treaty, & frequent applications to him upon matters that he is not authorized to act upon; therefore, he has been invited by Congress to attend them in this place, that they may avail themselves of his assistance in forming a peace arrangement, or as some call it a peace establishment;(2) but upon carefully attending to the confederation, I can't find that Congress have much to do upon this subject, as it seems to be left with the several states to keep up such a number of troops as Congress shall approve of; however I find we shall not all think alike upon this subject.  We have letters from Mr. Dana, dated sometime in April, by which it appears not probable, that he will enter into a commercal treaty with the Empress, as there is some objections, namely, that his commission was dated before the B. King acknowledged our independence, & that the Empress is invited by France, Spain, & G.B. to guarantee the definitive treaty when it is finished & that G. B. has not yet received a minister from the U. S. & therefore it might not be adviseable, at this time, to receive Mr. Dana in his public capacity; I hope he will leave that Court before he receives farther orders from Congress, as I feel myself too independent to ask favors of this kind, even of her imperial majesty.  AUGUST 14, 1783  I take it you are well acquainted with what took place in Philada. that caused Congress to adjourn to this place; and we have spent part of several days debating the question whether we shall return, but I think it is not likely that seven states will be in favor of returning at present, not withstanding the address of a large number of the citizens of Philada., the invitation of the Supreme Executive of the state, & the great influence of a certain number of gentlemen; so that you may suppose a number of us are determined not to return, if we can help it; and I believe you will not be much at a loss for the reasons of our conduct.  I find that 'tis the opinion of some persons that commutation was not the only reason that operated against the reelection of the delegates from Massachusetts,(3) & that some change was thought necessary for political reasons, but you, sir, that are well acquainted with the secrets of state, can I suppose, give me information; and others are of opinion, that it originated nearer Philada. than Boston; but I have no doubt that communication operated in the minds of the major part that voted.  The more I am personally acquainted with Doctr. Lee, the more he rises in my esteem. I was, lately, in hopes to have had his company in the same house with me, which he was desirous of, but we could not bring it about, and he has taken a chamber, on the other side of the street, & I believe we shall be neighbourly.  Mr. Gerry arrived here last week, has been to Philadelphia, & returned yesterday, & is to take his seat this day.  I have the honor to be, with perfect respect, your most obedient: S. Holten  P.S. Two of the sergeants are under sentence of death, that were concern'd in the late mutiny in the city of Philadelphia; but I do not expect that any of the sentences will be carried into effect 'till the whole trials are gone through with.(4) We have determined the question, as to returning to Philada., & there appeared but two states in favor of the return, (viz.)

  Princeton, State of  Revd & dear Sir,(1) New Jersey, 14 Aug. 1783  I have been favor'd with your agreeable attention of the 30th of June, but it did not come to hand 'till more than a month after the date, what prevented my having the pleasure sooner, I am not able to say.  You are pleased among other just observations to say \""tho we are blessed with peace, this is still a world of trouble\""; this will apply to us as a nation, as well as to each individual; and it is to be lamented by the good people of these states as a frown of providence that so soon after hostilities ceased, & before the definitive treaty is come to hand that one of the principal states in the union, should be so much dissatisfied with their national Council as to remonstrate against their proceedings, in two instances, namely, commutation to the officers of the army in lieu of half pay for life, & the salaries granted by Congress to their civil officers; and as I veryly believe, both Congress & the state I have the honor to represent, are actuated by the best motives to promote the public good, it gives me real concern to find that they differ so much in sentiments upon these matters; the difficulties Congress have had to encounter in the course of the late war, can be better conceived of by you, than expressed by me, but from my personal knowledge, they have been very great, and at some period of the war, they appeared to be almost insurmountable, and I consider that at such a period as I have last mentioned, Congress were obliged to promise the officers of their army half pay for life, if they would continue in their service to the end of the war and one year's full pay to each private. I have said obliged, I mean that at that time it was thought the best thing that could be done to keep the army together & after the greatest deliberation, as the officers were endeavouring in large numbers to resign their commissions; but if Congress at that time could have commanded money sufficient or procured credit, it might have answered the purpose, by paying them their wages, that was then due, but that not being the case, they were obliged to promise & pledge the faith & honor of their constituents to make them good. This leads me to consider what the present Congress has done, that is so disagreeable to my constituents, as very few of the members that now compose Congress were concerned in making their engagements to the army, & not one of us from Massachusetts; and when the officers had reason to think that the war was drawing to a close, they made application to Congress, setting forth their services, sufferings & the  AUGUST 14, 1783  promises that had been made them, & requesting payment, or some further security to be given them; and as they understood, that some of the states in the union did not consider half pay for life, in a favorable point of light, they were willing to make a commutation & settle the matter; the delegates from Massachusetts, supposing that a commutation with them would be much more agreeable to their constituents, and in favor of their interest, for several reasons that might be mentioned, took great pains to find out what would become their due according to the common period of mens lives, & finding that 22 years upon an average was the time that all seemed to be agreed in that they would live, therefore we should have to pay them 22 years half-pay or eleven years full pay & then after great deliberation it was thought advisable to offer them five years full pay, in such securities, as Congress gave their other creditors which you will take notice is less than one half of what would become their due, according to our own cast; and now, sir, I submit the matter to your judgment, & every other honest man that is acquainted with the subject, whether the present Congress have made a good bargain and how far the delegates from Massachusetts have been to blame in assenting to the same; but it is said that Massachusetts is not in favor of half pay, commutation or anything else, except their wages, if so, I have to lament that they did not signify their pleasure by instructions to their delegates, which would have been the rule of my conduct, and I should not then have considered myself personally answerable for the consequences.  As to the other matter the Honble Court has remonstrated against, there may be, & I believe there is, just grounds of complaint in some instances, but it should be considered, that it is much more chargeable living at foreign Courts in Europe, than people that are not acquainted with living abroad, & the business of foreign ministers, are apt to imagine, & notwithstanding the salaries that have been given to the public officers attending business when Congress sits, it has been difficult to get gentlemen of character in the several states to remove to Philadelphia & attend the public business, and for this very reason we have been obliged to appoint nine persons living near the place where Congress sits, in order to get the business done; but I believe Congress would do the delegates from Massachusetts the justice to say that they have always been attentive to the interest of their constituents in making grants.  There seems to be something peculiar respecting the settlement with the army as it respects the delegates from Massachusetts for about the same time that their constituents were signifying their disapprobation of their conduct, part of the army(2) were so dissatisfied as to surround the house where Congress were assembled & placed guards at their doors for several hours, because no more had been done for them; & I assure you, sir, our situation for some time was disagreeable  as the soldiers seemed to be prepared for the worst purposes; however, at that time I went out with several other members of Congress, & used every argument I could think of to convince them of their wrong proceedings, & to prevail with them to return to their barracks. I was sensible of danger, but was determined to do everything in my power to prevent the shedding of human blood, and it ought to be considered as a favor of providence that this unhappy affair proceeded no farther, & that some of the principal promotions [promoters] are likely to be brought to justice.  It gives me concern to hear that any of my good neighbours have got into difficulties, & wish it was in my power to afford them assistance. Several other matters, I intended to have noticed but must omit them 'till my next. As an apology may be thought necessary for the length of this tedious epistle already, but I shall only observe that there is much satisfaction in writing, with freedom, to a particular friend. I am, my dear sir, with sincere respect, your obliged friend, & very humble servant S. Holten. Reprinted from Danvers Historical Society Collections 26 (1939): 92- 94.  ""

  Dear Sir, PrinceTown, August 15, 1783.  Upon the Receipt of your Excellency's Letter,(1) I left Home as soon as I could, with any convenience; which was the first of this Month, and arrived here the sixth, a few Days after Colo. Hambleton was gone. Having been informed before I left Middletown that you was in Company with General Washington to the Northward, I came the most direct road by Kings Ferry, otherwise I should not have omitted calling on your Excellency at Poughkeepsie. Mr. Duane informs me that General Scott has received a sum of Money to enable him to attend Congress, tho' there is no probability of his coming on. I hope this will not put it out of your Power to supply me with a small sum; if it should, you will be so kind as to let me know it soon, that I may have oppertunity to procure it elsewhere. I have now a Ballance due to me from the State, for my Attendance in Congress, to the amount of £121.10.0. I  AUGUST 15, 1783  have had no oppertunity since the passing of the act for the paying and auditing the accounts of the Delegates, to lay this Account before the Auditor of the State; and it is not likely, if I must be present at the auditing, that I shall be able to present it for payment till after we get into New York: it would much oblige me if your Excellency will retain in your Hand, Out of the Monies directed to be loaned for the payment of such Accounts, a Sum sufficient to discharge this demand, when the Account shall be produced properly audited.  We have as yet no Account of the signing of the definitive Treaty or of the Time the British expect to leave New York. It is a long Time since advices have been received from our Commissioners at Paris. Congress do not seem at present to be hurried with Business. A Peace Establishment, which has been reported and on which General Washington is to be consulted (who will be here in a few Days) is a Business of much Consequence and ought soon to be perfected; but I fear delays will be made & some of the eastern States, if I am not much mistaken, will oppose the keeping of any Troops on the Frontiers especially those of New York.  It is ordered that an equestrian Statue of General Washington be made by the best artist in Europe under the direction of the Commissioner of the United States at Paris, and erected at the Place where the Residence of Congress shall be established. Where that Place will be is very uncertain. Pennsylvania and especially Philadelphia are now exceeding anxious for the Return of Congress to that City. 'Tis no wonder: they now see that it makes an Add'n of 100,000 Dollars at least to The State P. Annum. 'Tis said if Congress do not goe back, the Union will be dissolved; the State of Pensylvania will be so convulsed that they will not be in a Capacity of Contributing to the Necessities of the United States; they say if Congress would remove there but six weeks, to shew that there was no misunderstanding, all would be Peace & Quiet; & if they then removed, there would be no blame or uneasiness. 'Tis very doubtful to me if Congress ever return to Philadelphia and it is as doubtful where they will agree to have their Place of residence. I believe they will remove from this Place before winter, as tis thought they cannot be accommodated in that Season of the Year.  I shall do myself the honor of writing to your Excellency frequently during my residence here and am with great Respect & Esteem Your Excellencys most Obed't and very Humb. Ser't.  Ezra L'Hommedieu.

Our long suspense about the definitive treaty is now removed, as it appears by Letters lately recd. that no treaty was concluded the middle of June. The definitive treaty seems to have been out of sight, the attention of the ministry of Britain, as well as our Ministers, appears to have been confined principally to a Commercial treaty.  As your Legislature are now meeting, we are told their first work will be to investigate the proceedings of Congress in removing from Philada. For my part I cannot suppose Pennsylva. claims an exclusive Right to Congress and will undertake to determine where they ought to sit, nor can I believe their good sinse will suffer them to interfere in the matter. Whether the Council did right or not in refusing to call out the Militia, is a subject that had much better be forgot than investigated; what was done is past & cannot be undone. The Council I am told deny that the facts stated by the Committee are truly represented, should any dispute arise on that Account, it must be between the Council & the Committee, in which the latter would have the advantage, as the former refused to confer by writing as was requested by the Committee to prevent Mistakes.  I had proposed to have gone to Philada. yesterday, and enjoyed the pleasure of seeing my friends a short time, but my indisposition of body prevented; the very sudden changes of weather hath given a Shock to my crazy constitution so far as to render it imprudent to carry my self further from home at present.

The fears of the Ministry respecting the trade of America begin to subside  AUGUST 16, 1783  and as Mr. Lawrens observes \""Reciprocity appears now to mean enjoyment on one part, & restrictions on the other, this change may have been wrought by the sudden & unexpected arrival of divers ships & cargoes from different parts in the United States.\"" We long foresaw & feared this evil, but it was impossible with effect to offer a check to it, the Merchantile interest about Congress being so Powerful & opposed to the least suspicion of our immediate free trade with all the world. The natural consequence of such precipitancy, I fear will be, unless Congress should be able wisely to interpose, as Mr. Lawrens observed \""enjoyment on the part of Great Britain and restrictions on ours.\"" We may well imagine that the British Ministry will studiously avoid entering into any commercial stipulations with us, until they have well weighed all the advantages & disadvantages, attendant thereon, and until it shall be in their power in some measure to dictate such stipulations. It is already known that Mr. Hartley who was sent to treat at Paris about a Commercial Treaty, is only an instrument for gaining time, if I may so express it.

  Dear Sir Philada. Aug. 18. 1783.  I have not this week any more than the last the pleasure of acknowledging a favor from you. Perhaps I may find one at Princeton when I get there. On Thursday a question for returning to Philada. was put and decided in the Negative by a large majority. The friends of the measure foreseeing its fate, and supposing that a negative declaration cd. answer no good purpose and might an ill-one, withdrew it. The more moderate opponents concurred in the inexpediency of proclaiming unnecessarily an aversion in Congs to Philada. But some of this class were so keen in their hostility, that a motion was made by two of them to return, who on the question voted agst. their own motion. The public will not I believe fix on this proceeding as one of the brightest pages of the Journals! The abuses to which such an artifice may be extended are palpable. The merit of it in this application belongs to Mr. Howel of R. I. & Mr. B----d of V. The motion was first made by Mr. L. but in the course of the transaction devolved on Mr. Howel.(1) I know of none that will read with pleasure this affair unless it be the Executive of Pa. and those who wish to refer the removal of Congs. to other motives than the national dignity & welfare.  Congs. have letters from Mr. Laurens of the 17th June but they decide nothing as to the definitive Treaty. We have no reason however to impute the delay to any cause which renders the event suspicious. It is said that the British Councils grow more & more wary on the subject of a Commercial Treaty with the U. S. and that the spirit of the Navigation act is likely to prevail over a more liberal system. S. Carolina we learn has agreed to the Impost on condition only that the revenue be collected by her own officers, & be credited to her own quota.(2) It is supposed that she will agree to exchange the valuation of land for the proposed rule of numbers: But on this point R. I. is even more inflexible than on that of the Impost. I pity from my heart the officers of the Eastern line, who are threatened by these prospects with disappointments which the Southern officers have no Idea of. From much conversation which I have lately had with some of the former, and from other information, there appears great reason to believe that if no Continental provision be made for them they will not only be docked of their half pay, but will run great hazard of being put off with regard to a great share of their other pay on the pretence of their States that they have already advanced beyond their proportion. I expect Mr. Jones every moment.(3) AUGUST 18, 1783  ""

If the showers reached you, I hope you took care to have the apron up and the curtains drawn. I shall be anxious to hear from you.  I find the president is not likely to find a house. He had cast his eyes on the house where Mr Smith lives, which it seems belongs to the president of the College. Some intimation was given to the P. that doct Witherspoon would rent this house as he lived in his own house. Whether the doctor from a laudable desire of improving his income had it in contemplation to turn out his son-in-law & daughter & rent the house to the Pr. for a high rent, or whether any drew that conclusion from the prevailing temper of the doctr I will not undertake to say, but the P without farther ceremony applied to Mr Smith & informed him that he understood Mr W intended to rent the house. This was a thunder clap to Mr S. He said he had heard nothing of the matter. Mr. W had not mentioned it to him. He did not know where to go with his family. He had put himself to inconvenience to accommodate Members as much as he could, but he supposed he must give up his house. Possibly the trustees might think they had a right to let it as the presidt. of the College did not live in it himself. You can easily judge the feelings on both sides.

Every attempt to improve the late glorious Success, in a War so unequal; to the best Interests of the Citizens of these States, meets my hearty Concurrence and warmest Approbation. I have been in the midst of the principle Scenes of Action, during the whole Contest. I have not been a bare Spectator. I have carefully and attentively watched & Compared the Steps of divine Providence thro' the whole; and as the result, I can assure you, that our Success has not been the effect of either our Numbers--Power--Wisdom or Art. It has been manifestly the Effect (I was going to say miraculous Effect) of the astonishing and unparralelled Interposition of a holy God in our AUGUST 20, 1783  favour--of that God who speaketh & it is done--who commandeth and it cometh to pass.  I do not mean in the least, to derogate from the Bravery, wisdom, Patience & Perseverence of one of the most deserving Armies that ever graced any Country. As well might we decry the Merit of Moses, in conducting the Children of Israel thro the Wilderness, as I am clear that our political Salvation is not at all inferior to theirs. My Meaning is that in no Instance has our Numbers, Power, Wisdom or Art been such, that in the Judgment of rational, enlightened Judges, Success could have been reasonably depended on, independent of the special aid & overruling direction of Heaven.  In many Instances, our Misfortunes have been our Happiness, and often our Mistakes & Blunders have been the cause of our succeeding beyond the most sanguine Hope. Had it not been for the Loss of Ticonderoga, we should never have had the british & Hessian Standards to have graced the Victory of Saratoga--And had not our Troops have been totally routed at Cambden, York Town would not have added the haughty Cornwallis to the american Trophies.

  Dear Sir: Princeton, August 20th, 1783.  It has been represented by some of the Trustees that Edenton appears to a majority of the Board to be the most proper place for erecting the seminary to be called Smith's Academy.(1)... It will ever be in our power hereafter to remove our Academy to another place, should the people in and near Edenton become inattentive to the first command, and not have children to educate....Within the last two months, five boys have come to this town from N. Carolina to a Grammar School. Much divination is not required to foretell that they must draw at least £400 per annum in hard money out of the State. The Grammar School here is taught by two lads who are themselves students in the College. By such industry they bear their own expenses.

  Dear Sir, Private Princeton August 21st 1783 It is but this moment that your Excellency's Letter of the 14th Instt. has got to Hand.(1) The alarming illness of Mrs. Washington gives Mrs. Boudinot, my self & Daughter, real distress, our Prayers shall not cease for her recovery. E're this I hope your Excellency has recd. mine by the Secretary of War, which will inform you of the Intentions of Congress, that you should make your Journey here entirely agreeable to your own Convenience & Leisure.(2)  Since that Letter, we have recd. Letters from Mr. Laurens of the 14th & 18th June.(3) By these we are convinced that there is no definitive Treaty yet arrivd in New York. The Substance of his Letters is, \""That he had seen Mr Fox who made a Question whether the American Ministers were authorized & disposd to open our Intercourse or Commerce  AUGUST 21, 1783  on Terms of Reciprocity.\"" To Answer this, our Ministers immediately to wit, on the 29th Aprill made a proposition of several plain Simple Articles full to that Purpose, and tendered them for Execution to Mr Hartly--who at first approved of them, but after some hesitation acknowledged he had come to Paris without his Powers. He sent an Messenger to London with the proposition--and after a waste of 3 weeks, he returned with an Answer that they could not be agreed to.  2lst May Mr Hartley proposed Terms altogether inadmissable, but could not produce either Commission or Instructions for to compleat any Thing. Mr Laurens went to London from whence he writes and makes the following Observations \""My former Assurances have undergone a wonderful refinement. Reciprocity seems now to mean, Enjoyment on one side, and restrictions on the other. This Change may have been wrought by the unexpected & sudden arrival of divers Ships & Cargoes from different Ports in the united States. The british Minister at Paris candidly assured me that he was of this Opinion\"". Mr Laurens mentioned to Mr Fox his wish to stay a few days at Bath, but he feared that his Presence would be necessary at the signing of the Treaty. Mr Fox answered by assurring Mr L. that he might safely remain at Bath for some Days without danger--from which Mr L. concluded that there was not any thing likely to be done speedily. Mr Laurens says that the present Ministry is likely to be of a very short duration.  I have the honor to enclose three Letters to your Excellency committed to my Care from different Quarters.  Shall I presume so much on your Excellency's time, as once more to beg your attention, to the two Cannon that was designed for the Compte De Grasse.(4) I feel myself much hurt by the assurance I was led to give him that they should be sent to him by the Duc de Lazun, and which I was not able to effect.  Mrs. Boudinot & Miss Susan join me in the most affectionate regards for Mrs. Washington, most devoutly praying for her immediate recovery.  I have the honor to be with the highest respect, Your Excellency's Most Obed & Hble Serv, Elias Boudinot P.S. Congress have recd official Information from Sir Guy Carleton, that he has positive orders to evacuate New York without delay.5 Mr Laurens mentions the same Thing, as told him by Mr. Fox.  ""

  Dear Sir, Princeton, 21st August, 1783.  We have at length letters from Mr. Lawrence, our Minister, dated in London the 15th of June.(1) He does not mention the definitive Treaty; but declares that Secretary Fox had assured him that positive orders had been transmitted to Sir Guy Carleton for the final evacuation of New York. Sir Guy too in his despatches of the 17th instant(2) says that the June packet lately arrived had brought him final orders for the evacuation of New York \""and that he should lose no time, as far as depended upon him in fulfilling these commands.\"" \""But that notwithstanding his orders are urgent to accelerate the total evacuation, the difficulty of assigning the precise time for this event was of late greatly increased. The violence of the Americans\"" he adds \""which broke out soon after the cessation of hostilities increased the number of their countrymen who look to him for escape from threatened destruction; but that these terrors had of late been so considerably augmented that almost all within his lines conceived their safety to depend upon being removed by him, which rendered it impossible to say when the evacuation could be completed.\"" And again, \""that he should shew an indifference to the feelings of humanity, as well as to the honor and interest of the nation he served, to leave any of the Loyalists, that were desirous to quit the country a prey to the violence which they conceive they have so much cause to apprehend.\"" \""That should these fears continue, and compel such multitudes to remove, he should hold himself acquitted from any delay in the fulfilling his orders and the consequences which may result therefrom\""; and that he cannot avoid adding \""that it made no small part of his concern that Congress had thought proper to suspend to this late hour the recommendations stipulated by the Treaty, and in the punctual performance of which the King of Great Britain and his ministers had expressed such entire confidence.\"" In the course of his reasonings he refers to his correspondence with General Washington, with your Excellency, and our late Secretary for foreign Affairs; but he only transmits his own letter to your Excellency of the 25th of July. A Committee has these communications from Sir Guy under consideration. I endeavored from my memory to give them a detail of your correspondence; which induced a strong desire AUGUST 21, 1783  on their part to be possessed of the whole: for I had also informed them that you had it in contemplation to lay it before Congress. I have a further reason for wishing that the transmission of these papers may not be delayed. Since part of the correspondence is among the archives of Congress, it is proper that the whole should be there; and the more so, as the materials it affords may be of public utility. The only proofs which Sir Guy has furnished are deposition[s] of And. Fowler, Edmund Ward, and Lieut. Col. Hunt.(3) A Minister or Agent is arrived from Hamburgh, but has not yet reached Princeton. His business is to settle a commercial treaty. The Ambassador from the States General is on his passage to Philadel-phia.(4) We have ratified a Treaty with the King of Sweden. It is reported that the Emperor and the King of Denmark have appointed their Ambassadors for our Court, but you will be pleased to set this down as report. The Court of Spain has received Mr. Carmichael as our Minister or rather Charge des Affaires in the absence of Mr. Jay: but Russia continues cold towards Mr. Dana, at least, undecided.(5) Accept this small collection as the news of the day. At an important period it may justly be asked how it happens that nothing more satisfactory is communicated? It is not my fault, but we really hear nothing interesting from our ministers. I have been in pain lest I should forfeit your Excellency's opinion of my vigilance and attention; but believe me though I was drawn from home unreasonably, out of my routine, and to my great prejudice, to attend Congress this summer, I shall discharge my duty with alacrity; and embrace every opportunity to convince you that I am with great respect, and personal attachment, Dear Sir, your Excellency's most obedient and very humble servant, Jas. Duane  P.S. I entreat your Excellency to present my respectful compliments to Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Attorney Col. [Genl.] Benson, and Judge Hubbard [Hobart]. You will naturally conjecture that the recommendation directed by the Treaty is now brought on the tapis.  ""

  My dear & honourd Sir. Princeton 21st August 1783. I have waited with Impatience for some Intelligence worth your attention: but such a Dearth of every thing Interestg has prevailed that, at so critical a Period, is astonishing! We heard nothing from our Ministers from February, till last Fryday, after the Eastern Mail was dispatched. Even now not a Word is said of the principal object of our Solicitude--The definitive Treaty. Why it is delayed, or what are the real Impediments to its progress, we are still left to Conjecture. The AUGUST 21, 1783  general Opinion is that the Affairs of the Dutch create the Embarrassments. Our Minister Mr. Lawrence informs us that on the 14t of June, from London, that Secretary Fox had assured him that positive orders had been transmitted for the Evacuation of New York. This Fact is confirmed by Sir Guy Carleton in his Dispatches to Congress of the 17th Instant. He declares that his orders are urgent to accelerate a total Evacuation: but that the violence of the Americans has inspired such Terror that almost all within his Lines conceive their Safety to depend upon being removed by him, and that he shoud shew an Indifference to the Feelings of Humanity, as well as to the honor And Interest of the nation he serves to leave any of the Loyalists who are desirous to quit the Country a Prey to that Violence: He therefore declares that he holds himself acquitted from any delay in fulfilling his orders or the Consequences which may result therefrom. I make no Comment on Sir Guy's professions; to you it is unnecessary.  A Minister or Agent--for we know not his Character, is arrived from Hambourgh to negociate a commercial Treaty with the United States. He has not yet reached Princeton. The Embassador from the States General is certainly on his passage to Philadelphia. A House & Equipage have been for some time provided for him by his orders. Mr Carmikle the Secretary to the Embassy at Madrid, writes us that he has been publickly acknowledged And received by that Court as our Charges des affairs--but Russia has not paid the same respect to Mr Dana: her imperial Majesty's Attachment to Great Britain has led her to a cautious Conduct which gives us Just distaste. We have ratified a Treaty with Sweden; And it is reported that both Denmark and the Emperor have appointed Embassadors for our Court; but you will be pleased to consider what relates to the two last Princes, as resting only upon Report.  I have so many Dispatches to make up that I have no time to enlarge.  We are likely to remain at Princeton 'till the beginning of October. How we shall receive with any Dignity or accommodate with Convenience the great Personages we daily expect, I am at a loss to conceive. For ourselves, who are truly Republicans, we can make a tolerable shift at this crowded Village--having been many years familiar with wants.  Be pleased to present my dutiful Respect to Mamma and affectionate Compliments to every Branch of the Family and to believe that with every Sentiment of the sincerest affection I am always--My dear & honourd Sir, Your dutiful Son & most obedient Servant, Jas.

  Sir, Prince Town Augt. 21. 1783.  Your Letter inclosing a memorial to Congress(1) informed us, that a Committee had been appointed by the Court, to correspond with us upon public Affairs, for the purpose of getting information as to some particular important Points--it certainly must be very useful both to the Court & their Delegates, to have such Correspondence kept up--the Legislature ought to be made acquainted with the plans & Doings of Congress, & their Delegates in Congress should be informed of the Views & measures of the Court as such information would prevent our interference of measures, & promote the good both of the Public & the State. We have been in daily expectation, since we had last the honor of writing you, of receivg a Letter from the Committee, stating the particular Points on which you wished to be informed, but as no such Letter has yet come to hand, we can only give you such information as we think may be useful & agreable.  The Committee have not yet reported on your memorial,(2) but we have good ground to expect, that a reduction of the expence of the Civil List, will be reported & adopted by Congress as some Offices may now be abolished, others rendered less expensive by reducing the Salaries of the Officers, the expence of that List we think may be reduced one half, without incurring any inconvenience. Congress have decided on the Question of returning to Phila., their were seven nays, two Ays & one divided, Maryland & Pensilvania Ay, North Carolina divided.(3) This decission We conceive must be agreable to the States & useful to the public, for the members will be more free from influence, while they remain here, than they can be in Phila. or in any large commercial City. It is expected that Congress will remain here, at least, till the time shall arrive, when they are to make choice of a place for their permanent Residence; & many are desirous that this Town, or some good Situation in this State, may be their choice. As the residence of Congress will necessarily give additional weight to that State in which they shall permanently be fixed, it is thought more eligible, to throw that weight into a scale which may now be rather too light--it had better be given to a small than to a large & influential state; & as this State is convenient in its situation, has but little Commerce, & abounds with fine healthy places for such an establishment, many gentlemen appear desirous of remaining in it. We expect that Our Assembly will give us their Sentiments on this subject, Congress having notified all the states, of the time when they are to make their election, & communicated the several Cessions which have been pro- AUGUST 21, 1783  posed, by those states that wish to have Congress reside with them, in order that each state may have an opportunity, of stating its reasons in favour of, or against any of the places proposed.  Nothing has yet been done as to the old money, the Question was to have been agitated last week, but two States, Pensylvania & Maryld. left Congress as soon as they had decided not to return to Philadelphia. Eight States only remaining on the Floor, that Question is necessarily delayed till another State shall arrive, which is daily expected.  The Papers we sent you inclosed in Our last Letter, will show you the intention of Congress & of the Superintendant of Finance, relative to the Soldiers that were furloughed,(4) nothing more than the three months pay is to be expected. No permission will be given to the States, to pay to their own Troops any mony on account of the requisition for 1782, it is however expected, that Our State will be obliged to make some payment to Their Line, though the sanction of Congress is refused. Maryland has paid five months pay to her Troops out of that Tax, & it is thought more eligible, that the States should make such payments, if found necessary, even without applying to Congress for permission, as did Maryland, than that Congress should authorize their so doing, contrary to the opinion of the Office of Finance.  It was stated in the instructions We received, that the Massachusetts Troops, \""had received no payment previous to their being furloughed & were not furnished with even the means of Subsistence on Their way home,\"" upon this information We called for an explanation of this Conduct, it being very far from the intention & widely different from the manner, in which the other Troops were sent home. Returns have since been received from the pay master general in answer thereto, by which it appears, to Our mortification, that the greater part of them had received the full amount of their Notes in goods from the Contractors Stores, previous to their being marched off, & at Their own request a part of them did not take goods, & the Notes having then not arrived at Camp, they left powers with their Officers or Paymasters, who have since received the Notes. Rations were allowed to them all, while on the Road, & the provisions delivered to them from the magazines. We shall send you Copies of these returns from the Pay master for your information.  By Letters from Mr. Laurance & Mr. Adams to the middle of June We learn, that no Commercial Regulations had then been agreed upon between Our Commissioners & the British--the Ministry appeared to be very indecided on this Subject, & were supposed to be in a tottering situation. Mr. Laurance who was then in London, imagined that a change of ministers would soon after take place, but neither he nor Mr. Adams say one word about the definitive Treaty--perhaps the instability of the then ministers may account for the delay, both as to the definitive & the commercial Treaties--it is not uncommon for  them in such Circumstances, to delay coming to any decission in so important Questions. It being very material that Our Assembly should have full information as to the Doings of Congress in general, & more especially their foreign Negociations, & as many papers must be furnished in order to give such information, We have concluded upon having a Clerk for a month or a two to take the necessary Copies.  We have directed the Superintendant of Finance, to lay before us the necessary Estimates, for framing a new requisition on the States, for the Interest on the Debt for the year 1784, there being no prospect of the States adopting the late recommendations, to provide for the payment of the Interest--no State has yet adopted the plan, except in part only, nor is there much probability that they will any of them do it as recommended.  This was intended as an official Letter at first, but my Colleagues being out of the way & the mail about to be closed, I must seal it without their Signatures. I intend soon to return home, as Mr. Gerry has taken Seat, when I shall have the honor in person to give you such information as you may wish for.  I am Sir with respect your most obedt. & very huml. Servant S. Higginson  P.S. the Advertisement in the inclosed paper, respecting Mr. Morris's Notes, should be reprinted that the Soldiers may know what measures are taken to redeem the Notes.(5) ""

  Dear Hannah: [August 21, 1783] I have received your letters dated Monday 12 o'clock and Tuesday 10 o'clock at night and acknowledged the receipt of them....Mr. Read was misinformed respecting the adjournment. They met on Monday but they might as well have adjourned till this time for any AUGUST 21, 1783  business they have done. I am very apprehensive that nothing but some calamity will awaken the states to a sense of their situation.... The President of Congress has not provided a house for himself nor is [it] likely he will find one here to suit him. I find Elizabethtown has been talked of at his table as a proper place for the residence of Congress. He has a house there which he says has twenty rooms and which he will let for the use of the President. It is true the place is infested with mosquitoes in summer and lying low and near marshes may be liable to intermittents in the spring and fall, but these are trifling when it ts considered that by fixing the residence of Congress there the value of his estate will be increased and he will have an opportunity of letting his house at a good rent. But yet I am inclined to believe this will be opposed by his colleagues; for Mr. Condi[c]t has found a lodging in this town at 3 dollars a week which enables him to lay up money. And there is reason to fear that at Elizabethtown, which is so near New York, it will cost him at least four. This would be a clear loss of 52 dollars a year which is no trifling consideration, and which I daresay will have due weight with some others. There are other weighty considerations which might be mentioned.  Your loving husband, Chas. Thomson.

  Dear Sir, PrinceTown, August 22, 1783.  Since I did myself the Honour of writing to your Excellency last Week, we have received Letters from Mr. Lawrence (who is in England) as late as the 17th of June; who says, that a few Days before he wrote, I think it was the 14th of the same month, Mr. [Charles James Fox] assured him, that Orders were actual gone for the Evacuation of New York, and Mr. Lawrence does not seem to doubt it. This Information respecting the definitive Treaty is not so favorable; in short he says nothing about it further than is connected with the Treaty of Commerce. He informs that after Mr. Hartley had been in Treaty with our Commissioners at Paris for near a Month, it Appeared that he had no Powers to ratify any One Thing. The Commissioner's from the United States made Proposals to the British Commissioner respecting the Regulations of Trade between the Two Nations; as the British Commissioner had no Powers to agree he proposed sending the same to his Court; he did so, and they were there rejected. At present it seems far from British Policy to make any Treaty with America on the Principles of Reciprocity. They have now every advantage of our Commerce without any obstruction on our Post, given to others.  Mr. Lawrence observes that if a Change of the Ministry in Great Brittain should take Place, which he does not think unlikely, our Affairs with that Kingdom will probably be greatly embarrassed.  The Day before yesterday we received Dispatches from Sir Guy Carleton informing that he had received orders to leave New York, which he should do as soon as he could, but he was not able to determine when, being, as he says, obliged to provide for great Numbers, who by the Threats of Committees, and the Proceedings of the Commissioners of Sequestration, are greatly alarmed and are afraid to stay in the Country. He complained loudly against the State of New York for suffering the Commissioners to bring Actions of forcible Detainer against Persons in Possession of their own Farms in Westchester, by which means many have been lately turned out of Possession and subject each to Costs of about ten Pounds, he has sent on the Records of Two or three Tryals: some of the Correspondence between your Excellency & himself he has also transmitted. He finds fault that the Legislature of the State of New York has not been convened. I conclude the Reasons he would urge for calling them and the Reasons why it would at present be improper for them to meet. All these Papers are committed to a Committee.(1) I forgot to mention that he endeavours to justify his Conduct in carrying of the Negroes. Mr. Parker went thro' this Place Two Days ago on his way to Philadelphia, being imployed by Sir Guy to procure a Number of Transports for his governments Service.  AUGUST 22, 1783  Last Week a Question, whether Congress should adjourn the last of this Week, to meet at Philadelphia the first of next Week, being put, & the ay & no being called, it passed in the Negative, two States only, Pensylvania & Maryland, voting in the Affirmative. Notwithstanding this Vote I should not be surprised to find Congress in Philadelphia before Winter. The Expectation of the sudden Arrival of M. Van Borkel is now urged for their removal to that City, where he with the other, foreign Embassadors, who will probably be over this fall, can be better accomodateed than in this Place.  With respectful Compliments to Mrs. Clinton, I am with great Respect & Esteem Your Excellency most obed. Sert.  Ezra L'Hommedieu.

  Sir, Princeton August 23d. 1783 I arrived here on the 27th Ultimo., after a very uncomfortable Journey in a most severe heat, from the ill effects of which I am now recovered to a good State of health, and have been able to attend Congress every day, one only excepted. The representation from the States is small, there being seldom more than eight present, & often not more than seven. I have taken the liberty to write to the Honble President,1 and to suggest the propriety of furnishing a representation from New Hampshire, in case Mr. Langdon declines to come on, sooner than the time to which the General Court stands adjourned; this I have done not only from my own Opinion on the subject; but from the general Opinion of the other Deligates, who conceive it, at this time, very important to have a full representation.  The question for returning to Philadelphia, has been several times debated, and at length negatived; notwithstanding that the Executive of Pensylvania, has, thro the Deligates of that State, expressed its wish for the return of Congress to its former Seat. No assurances have been given of protection should there be any occasion for it in future. I therefore presume, you will be of the opinion Congress could not with propriety return, under these circumstances. The General Assembly of Pensylvania is now sitting, whither it will cast any censure on the Executive, or give any assurances to Congress of aid & protection against insult in future, time only can discover: should this step be taken, yet the difficulties which have heretofore attended all attempts to remove from Philadelphia, may possibly recurr so forceably, as to prevent a return to that City. I hope in the course of next week, Congress will determine on the application from New Hampshire, relative to the Loan AUGUST 23, 1783  Office Certificates. In the present week I have omitted to call for the report, as I was satisfied the States present, would not have determined it agreeable to the wishes of my constituants.(2) This day his Excellency General Washington arrived here from the Northward, he will tarry some time, & then proposes to retire to his Plantation in Virginia. Sir Guy Carleton hath given information to Congress, that he has received orders for the final evacuation of New York, but hath said nothing respecting evacuating the other posts within the United States, however that may possibly be also in his instruction.  I enclose the last Philadelphia Paper, and beg the favor that you will send me any thing which may be interesting especially whatever may enable me to serve the interests of the State I have the Honr. to represent.  There seems little hope that the late recommendation of Congress with respect to impost, will be adopted by Rhode Island, parhaps not as it stands, by some other of the States: the consequence will be unhappy to public credit, and induce a necessity of other expedients, if indeed they can be devised, for providing for the public Debt.

  Dear Sir, Prin[c]eton, Augt. 23d. 1783  Your favor of the 8th is before me, & I am much concernd to hear of your ill health. But the mountain Air will I hope speedily relieve you. There is no account of the definitive treaty, nor do I indeed see any great necessity for it, as the preliminaries serve all the purposes of a treaty & if G. B. chuses to break with us, the latter woud be no more an obstacle than the former. But there is no danger She will attempt any rupture with us shortly, as the annl. interest of her debt amounts to £9,008,931. This year She has been obligd to add 26. Milln. to her debt in order to borrow 12. Miln. Every Account from N. York confirms me in my opinion, that it will be evacuated in three months. The numbers of Refugees gone, & to go, amounts to 22 thousd. Genl Washington arrivd here this day, in exceeding good health. He made an observation which perfectly coincides with my sentiments; & which I woud to God, the People of America had considerd in time. It is, that in persecuting the Tories we were playing Sr. Guy Carelton's game, since he must wish to increase the Colony of Nova Scotia & di- AUGUST 23, 1783  minish the People of the U S. I must add, that it is obvious nothing can be more pleasing to the King of England than our taking such measures as will add to the number of his subjects & diminish ours. It is so far repairing the loss His Crown sustains from our success. Besides, it places those Loyalists, whom he must love, in the light of a persecuted People, & therefore ensures to them more liberal contributions from the Parliment & People of England. At the same time it wounds our national character, by holding us up as a vindictive, persecuting People, & which we flatter ourselves that we are avenging ourselves on the Refugees, we are in fact serving them. If you think the publication of these sentiments will serve our Country, you will, I hope graft them upon others & commit them to the press.  It is said here, that Mr. Hardy has given his opinion, or written it to some Correspondent here--that we ought to return to Philadelphia. I own this surprises me, as I can conceive no step more unworthy of or more injurious to Congress.  I am of opinion with you that tobo. will rise, therefore I wish you to use your discretion in the sale of it. I am sorry to have an instance in a person of Genl. Nelson's character & fortune, how little trust one can repose in that compliance with engagements in money or tobo. I enclose a Letter on the subject which I beg you to contrive to him.(1) With every deference to the wisdom of those who orderd it, I must be permitted to think that the issuing the proclamation you mention was a very injudicious measure. I am sure it will at least have very injurious effects on our trade.(2) Remember me if you please to Messrs. Lomax, Randolph & Hardy.

  Sir, Princeton August the 23d 1783  Since our last private letters, we have received the enclosed of the 17th instant from Sir Guy Carleton. The other six numbers are these refered to in Sir Guys Letter: These enclosures with these we formerly sent, make the whole of the correspondence on this Subject.(1) We observed on the 16th(2) that Congress had received letters from Mr.  AUGUST 23, 1783  Lawrens dated London June the 17th informing them, Mr. Fox had given him assurances that positive orders for the removal of the British forces from New York were actually dispatched. These are the orders alluded to probably in Sir Guy Carletons letter, and if, as he seems to assert, it is to depend on Congress and the respective Legislatures to facilitate the evacuation, by abating the fears of the Loyalists; it naturally follows, that altho' Congress should earnestly recommend the completion of the 4th, 5th & 6th articles of the provisional treaty, the British forces could not be removed from New York until the British General knew the effect of such earnest recommendation, & how much the fears of the Loyalists were abated: as he observes, he should shew an indifference to the feelings of humanity, as well as to the honor & interest of his nation, to leave any of the Loyalists that were desireous to quit the Country, a prey to the violence they conceive they have so much cause to apprehend. As this Letter warrants no other conclusion the evacuation cannot possibly take effect til late in the fall or perhaps early in the ensuing Spring. Congress have judged proper to suspend the recommendations stipulated by the treaty,(3) as well as the sending forward the treaty to the several States, altho, it is ratified: and whether they will do any thing further in this business until they hear from their Ministers at Paris, is at present uncertain. We are well satisfied that your Excellency must be in a very disagreeable suspence respecting the whole of this important affair, and we lament, it is not in our power to remove it having received no letters from our Ministers at Paris since February. Mr. Lawrens informed us that the British Ministry from late accounts are in a tottering state, and should the late premier receive the reins which were plucked out of his hand, he apprehended every thing in his power will be attempted to embarrass our proceedings. Eight years experience is sufficient to teach us, that we have every thing to fear, & nothing to expect from the British Empire, but what springs from our own, & the generous exertions of our Magnanimous ally. Certainly the explanation given by Sir Guy Carleton of the article respecting the negroes, is not warrented if we understand the language it is expressed in; and we should have supposed it to spring from the politics of the British Court had not the General avowed it as an opinion of his own, and you will observe his reasoning on it, is as fallacious as their whole conduct has been deceitful & wicked.  The fears of the British Ministry respecting the trade of america begin to subside. Their boast of perfect reciprocity while they were reduced and compelled as it were, for their political safety to enter into the provisional treaty with us, appears now to mean enjoyment on one part & restrictions on the other. Mr. Lawrens supposes this change to have been wrought by the sudden & expected arrival of divers Ships & cargoes from different parts of the United States into England. We  long foresaw & feared this evil, but it was impossible with effect to offer a check to it: the mercantile interest about Congress being so powerful & opposed to the least suspicion of an immediate & free trade with all the world. Every circumstance proves our precipitancy to be extreme folly: and unless Congress should be able wisely, and immediately to interpose, no treaty can be made, that will bind all the States, as no treaty could be made, that would in every thing suit the different interests of all the different States.  The Contractors for supplying the Spanish navy & army, have given a preferance to the Americans to supply them with such articles as are wanted, Vizt. Masts, spars, Tar, pitch, grain and rice. We submit to your Excellency whether as our State, will (unrivalled by the United States) be able to furnish the greatest part of these articles, it would not be prudent for the Legislature to attend to the Inspection Laws. If we should be guilty of any frauds, the Spaniards will certainly reject our commerce and depend for supplies from the Baltic.  We have the honor to be &ca, Benjamin Hawkins  Hugh Williamson  ""

  Sr. Prince Town Augt. 23d 1783 We have been honor'd with Yrs. of the 9th Inst.(1) Sr. Guy Carleton writes in a letter to Congress dated Augt. 17th that the June Packet lately arrived has brought him orders for evacuating that Place--and that he shall loose no time in fulfilling his Majesty's commands--but he adds--that notwithstanding his orders are urgent to accelerate the Total evacuation--the difficulty of assigning the Precise time for that event is of late greatly encreased--which he attributes to--the effects which the Proceedings of the Committes &.c. have had on the Loyalists, who concieve--he says--the safety both of their property and their lives depends on their being removed by him. For this he appeals to the Gazettes, and daily publications in the U. S.--and he further adds--he should shew an Indifference to the feelings of humanity as well as to the honor and Interest of the Nation he  AUGUST 23, 1783  serves to leave any of the Loyalists that are desirous to quit the Country a prey to the violence they concieve they have so much reason to apprehend--on which grounds he appears to Justify himself for any delay in the evacuation which may take place. He also expresses his Surprize that Congress have not officially interposed their authority to restrain the Violences he speaks of, and taken other steps to carry into execution the terms of the Treaty. He appears however to think that no blame is imputable to himself, in the glaring infringement of the 7th Article in suffering so large a Number of Negroes to be carried off under the flimsy pretext that they were declared free by the Proclamation of his predecessors, previous to his arrival and the Signature of the treaty from whence he draws this Singular conclusion that they could not possibly be the objects of the negotiation. The official information of the evacuation being soon to take place however, suggested to us the propriety of hastening a demand of the records, papers &.c. belonging to our State and its Citizens, which Congress agreed to in the form of a General resolution comprizing those of all the other States.(2) We have no doubt but yr. Excelly. will take the necessary steps to avail Yr self of the demand as far as concerns the State of Virginia. There seems to be no expectations of the difinitive treaty being speedily concluded. The Powers of Europe seem to have their attention fixd on the War between the two Imperial Courts and the Porte,(3) and on forming Peace establishments, which indeed are so large with respect to their Marine that it may be calld, not improperly Arming for peace. With respect to the return of Congress to Philadelphia which Yr. Excelly. seems to fear--I believe you may be perfectly at ease on that score, as all Ideas of that sort seem to have vanishd, since the great Majority appeard on the Vote we had the honor to transmit you on that Question--in our last.

  Dear sir, Princeton 23rd Augt. 1783  Signum vitæ and other hard words apart, I am ready to admit that it is possible and not very improbable that Mrs Mease may be afflicted with a Schirrus Uteri but I have not yet considered this as certain and have as I admit shewed Conservation which tended towards giving any opinion on that particular Symptom. You must certainly know what is meant by any Part being schirrous. The Part so affected is generally considerably enlarged and hard & is often unattended by any Pain. It is a particular kind of swelling very distinct from inflammatory swellings. Thus you have seen the Breast of a woman giving suck greatly inflamed and swell'd with much Pain. Such swellings are being inflammatory tend to suppuration & soon terminate. You may also have seen one of the Breasts of a Lady who formerly had given suck having no milk in it at present but hard and greatly enlarged continuing in that form during Life, this is generally of that kind which are calld schirrous swellings. Such swellings often affect the Uterus, and perhaps they are more hurtful there than in any other Part of the Body because they generally affect or prevent the Regular System of a womans good Health meerly by their Situation. But I have frequently known strong appearances of that Complaint when it did not Exist. There are also Instances of the Parts adjacent to the Uterus being schirrous while it was free. Now on a supposition, of what by the way, is very true, that there is not any person living, my own sisters not excepted, for whose Health I am more solicitous than for Mrs Mease's: you may wonder why I have appear'd more inquisitive on this Subject; But you are to observe it is one of the Things which like fate you need not be very solicitous about; for Enquiries do not prevent & I presume that medicine did never remove it. There are however Instances, many of them, of its being attended for Years together with a considerable Degree of good Health. Such AUGUST 23, 1783  Health is only to be expected from, what I so earnestly recommended, Good Air and Exercise. I hope she may recover before Winter such a degree of Strength as not to be in danger of sinking into that low State we saw her last Spring.

  Dear Sir, Princeton 24 Aug. 1783.  I have the Satisfaction to inform you that I have enjoyed a good State of health ever since I left home--that I have been well received by my friends in Philadelphia as well as in the jersies--and that I am treated with sufficient respect in Congress.  The question of adjourning to Philadelphia hung a long time by the eyelids; but is at length decided in the negative. It may be expected that those who still wish a return to Philadelphia will continue to obstruct business here as much as may be in their power. Pennsylvania, Delawar & Maryland are at present unrepresented: as are also Georgia & N. Hampshire. Owing to an incomplete representation little business has as yet been done: nor is there a prospect that much will be done 'till the new Delegates arrive next November.  For what intelligence is passing I must refer you to my Letter of the 19th to Gov. Bowen.(1) My Situation here is very agreeable to me. I am among my friends & old acquaintance: & I will take upon me to say that few young men ever had more friends in their native Country than myself.  The air in this place is good & the Situation pleasant. While suffocating heat, sickness & frequent Deaths take place in Philadelphia; a Salutary, free air, & general healthfulness prevail in this little village. Some of the Southern Gentlemen are so pleased with their present residence that they have it in contemplation to purchase Seats here. It is even called the Montpelier of America. Next October is assigned to fix on the place for the permanent residence of Congress. It is very doubtful whether any seven States will be able to agree upon any one place; but untill seven do agree this will be the place. There are some considerations of weight in favour of this State & even of this Spot. It is nearly in the center of the population & wealth of the U.S. This is a small State & therefore its influence is not to be feared. It never will be a very wealthy State, not being calculated for commerce: it may therefore preserve the purity of its manners as long as any; & even its Liberty, for corruption follows luxury, & luxury wealth. Altho' this State is in favor of the Impost, it is simply because of their consuming the imports of other States: they do not join in the views of those who mainly support that measure. They wish to retain their Constitution & the confederation, in other respects, unimpaired. They are against half-pay, high Salaries, pensioners, &c.  as much as N. England. They wish not to add to the powers of Congress--they are jealous of the designs of Pennsylvania--they always have joined us in the question of the Western Lands. AUGUST 24, 1783  As the question of the permanent residence of Congress is of great moment; I pray you to write me fully your Sentiments thereon--I wish to have the most unreserved communications from my Constituents on all material points. Pray speak to my friends to write me & let them know that their Letters will come to me & mine return to them free cost. I believe no State writes less to its Delegates than R. Island. I can say in great truth that I wish to serve the State in its essential intrests; but if I err for want of knowing their wishes, I shall wash my hands of all blame.(2) I pray you to mention me to my friends & to communicate to as many as you may see fit the Substance of this Letter. You may also inform them that I am fully of opinion that few if any States in the Union will comply with the late revenue recommendations of Congress. Several States have had them under consideration. Some have partially complied. Their acts I propose to send to the State as soon as they may come to hand--to the end that you may not be imposed upon in regard to the doings of other States as you was last year. Notwithstanding the promptness & boasting of Pennsylvania it will appear that our State has contributed more to the cause than they have in every point of view--in money, men, loans [&] Specifics--and another fact will also app[ear]--that State, in the first stages of the war, when m[oney] was of value recd more out of the Treasury t[han] any other, (I trust) in the Union. With wha[t] ill grace then have they set themselves to villify oth[ers?](3) I know not how far a Letter of this kind may be agreeable to you: but I have ventured to write you thus freely knowing that you have also a venture on bord the ship, tho you decline standing at the Helm. I [trust?] you will accept it as a testimony of the great regard & esteem, with which I am, Dear Sir, your sincere friend & hble Servt, David Howell P.S. I have enclosed you an order on Mr. Benj.

12120,dg020507,1783,David Howell to Thomas G Hazard,"""David Howell to Thomas G. Hazard
  Dear Sir:(1) Princeton 26 Aug. 1783.  Letters from Mr. Dana At St. Petersburg, dated March last afford little hopes of his being received at that Court in character of a minister from the U.S. Her imperial Majesty seems resolved to carry her principles of neutrality to the utmost extent. She requires that Mr. Dana's letters of credence should be dated after the recognition of our independence by the Court of G. Britain; & even after a minister from us shall be rec'd at the British Court. This however is the purport of several conferences betwixt the Count de Ostermonn & Mr. Dana. British counsels prevail, at least with the minister--perhaps they fear an interference of trade. Mr. Dana has leave to return & may be soon expected. I know not what business we have with her imperial majesty. Her friendship would cost us a least 11,000 Dollars a Annum, for that is the salary of a Foreign Minister, & the expense of his secretary, clerk, & would make a round sum in the whole.  A letter from Mr. Carmichael dated Madrid April last makes mention that he had been rec'd at that Court in quality of Charge des Affaires in Mr. Jay's absence--that he had had the honor to dine at the table of the Count De Florida[blanca] with the Diplomatic Corps. Thus Spain has come in at the 11th hour--& of course an ambassador &c is to be kept up at the Court, the expense of which can be calculated easier than the benefit. On Mr. Jay's return to Madrid (but I hope he will have more spirit than to return after the neglect with which he was so long treated by that ______ Court) he will be presented to his Majesty with customary formality. A letter has been rec'd lately from a Mr. Robert Montgomery,)(2) at Alisant, wherein he makes mention that in consequence of an authorization, I suppose from our Minister at Paris, he had addressed the Emperor of Morocco, on the subject of a treaty of amity & commerce--that he had received a friendly answer--That the Emperor was desirous of cultivating the Frindship of the U. S.--and that for this purpose he had sent an Envoy to our Minister at Paris. It will undoubtedly be of some consequence for us to be on good terms with the coast of Barbary: & it must give you pleasure to find that affairs are in a good train for that purpose.  His Danish Majesty & the Elector of Saxony have also thro their ministers signified their disposition to be on good terms with us. Thus have we lived to see the day when the U. S. are not only allowed rank among the nations of the earth; but from the renown of their atchievements all nations are ambitious of testifying their regard to us & of forming those treateis, which may lay a foundation for a friendly AUGUST 26, 1783  intercourse in future. In short, our trade is the object of the commercial speculators thro'out Europe; and the power of the U. S. it is thought will one day materially affect the ballance of power in Europe. It will perhaps be our best policy not to connect ourselves too intimately with any European power--thus while all have their hopes they will also have their fears & we shall be safe. A letter has also been rec'd from Mr. H. Laurens, dated London June. He says that after Mr. Hartley had had some conference with our Ministers jointly & severally on the subject of a commercial treaty to be entred into with the British Court, our ministers delivered Mr. Hartley a paper containing some propositions to form the basis of the treaty on principles of reciprocity. Mr. Hartley after some time returned another paper to our Ministers with proposals somewhat different--and on Mr. Hartley being strictly questioned whether he was authorized to enter into a treaty with us on the grounds of his own propositions, he replied that he was not; but that he would write to his Court for such power, provided his propositions were agreeable.  It appeared on the whole that Mr. Hartley was not duly authorized. His object seems to have been only to sound the minds of our ministers & to make report to the British Court. It further appears that the Court of London are not in haste to establish any treaty of commerce with us. Their King is cloathed with a kind of discretionary power in regard to their trade with us. The principles of their commerce are so extensive & complicated that many things are to be attended to, many intrests to be consulted & many persons to be pleased in the affair of a treaty of commerce with the U. States. The British seek a preference in our trade. This no nation ought to have. It is the present policy of Congress (& long may it remain!) to be at peace & have a free, unfetter'd trade with all the World.  The Masachusetts State has presented a memorial to Congress against the commutation of half-pay & against the high salaries of the civil list of Congress. They speak a plain language--as plain as they spoke to the British Court. They observe that they fear that in the resolve for commutation Congress did not sufficiently attend to the public good--the rules of equity--or to the spirit of the Confederation. That such high salaries do not agree with the republican principles, which the people of that State inherit from their ancestors--And that for these reasons they have with held their assent to the Impost. Why did they not first grant the impost & then remonstrate against high salaries? It is in contemplation, at least with some of us, to reduce the civil list in number, as well as salaries. Two Ministers, at the most, would be sufficient to reside in Europe--with some Consuls in the principal commercial States. Necessity should the impost not be  AUGUST 236, 1783  granted will compel Congress into economical measures (and I am sorry to give it as my opinion that nothing else will) for they will not have money at command, the grants of the States being strictly appropriated to pay the debts of the U. States. And while the States retain the command of their own purses, Congress will find themselves under the necessity of paying some little attention to their wishes; otherwise would it be should Congress be vested with power to collect & appropriate a great & permanent revenue.  By late letters from So. Carolina it appears that their Gen. Assembly are now sitting--that there is no danger of their complying with the impost &c agreebly to the recommendation of Congress. They are ready, say they, to pay their quota agreeably to confederation; but they insist on a separate credit for all the money they pay. It still remains uncertain what Virginia will do. Maryland, N. Jersey, &c have partially complied; but such compliance is nugatory, for the resolves say that every tittle must be complied with--that you must drink the whole of the bitter cup--even to the very dregs. A General compliance, I believe, is already despaired of by the most sanguine advocates of administration: & in consequence certain gentlemen look as we say somewhat chopfallen. It is given out that nothing but a general concession will bring us right. Quere, have not late measures a great tendency, on that principle to reduce us to order? Measures are in train to enable the Loan officers to issue certificates for intrest due on L. O. certificates & other liquidated debts due in the respective state, which certificates are to be receivable in payment of the Quota on the requisition of the 4th of Sept. last for one years intrest. Also that officers liquidate all outstanding certificates agreeable to the Continental Scale & issue new certificates in their stead. It is also ordered that the Superintendent of Finance lay before Congress an estimate of intrest to become due in 1784 to the end that Congress may make another requisition for intrest on consitutional grounds. This will I hope give a fatal blow to the second impost as the requisition of the 4th of Sept. last did to the first. The intrest ought to be paid & if it can be paid on constitutional principles the public creditors will be contented. Every opposition seems to be given by certain gentlemen to attempt to pay our debts unless it is done precisely in their way. Viz, it must be collected by a penal ordinance enacted by Congress & by Continental officers situated in the several States (to support the national dignity) and sent to Philadelphia (to be counted over & pocketed by ______) & then sent back again if any may be spared to the several States to pay the very men who paid the tax in the first instance. It is easy to see the tendency of this innovation on our Constitution; & I cannot but fully confide that the good sense of the States will revolt at a measure so replete with chicanery, nonsense & abuse. I cannot but consider it as a special interposition of divine Providence in favour of the Liberties of   this country that Congress should be driven out of Philadelphia at this juncture. The Atmosphere of that City is unfriendly to Liberty. They speak great swelling words of vanity in their address to Congress; but I am told it is fact that they were the last to favour the Independance of the U. S. & I know it to be fact that their contribution in men, money & Specific have been among the lowest in the Union. True it is they have loaned much, but to good advantage & for which we are to pay them thro' the nose. It will be found too on examination that the State of Pennsylvania has recd more out of the public Treasury than perhaps any other State & that they have drawn immense sums into their coffers by the residence of Congress among them.  Matters are taking a favorable turn in sundry respects since Congress have been in this place. We seem to be emancipated from the bondage & dictation of a certain office.(3) I cannot but hope that the plan laid for giving a tone to our fOEderal government, as gentlemen chose to express themselves will be discomfited. For my part I like well the tone in Confederation: & hope the free tone of that important instrument may never be altered for the tone of Tyrany.  The Situation & air in this little village are highly agreeable to me as well as to many others. Several of the Southern Gentlemen have it in contemplation to purchase seats here. It is even called the Montpelier of America. We shall at least stay here till seven states can agree upon another place, which will not I presume soon take place. There are several considerations in favor of establishing this place as the permanent residence of Congress. It is nearly in the center of the population & wealth of the U. States. It is situated at an equal distance betwixt the two great cities of Philadelphia & New York--In a place of safety; as one or the other of those places must first fall into the hands of an enemy before they could penitrate here. The State of N. Jersey, as subsisting by agriculture & having no great marts for trade, can never be very wealthy and of course will longest preserve a simplicity of manners & republican principles for wealth begets luxury, luxury corruption & a general depravity of manners, fatal to the freedom of any country. N. Jersey being a small State cannot extend a dangerous influence into the public counsels; the effects of which we have sadly experienced in the City of ______ pray be so kind as to favour me with your sentiments at large on the subject of the permanent residence of Congress. October, you know, is appointed for the determination of that important question. I hope you will stimulate my other friends to write me. I am ready to answer any letters I may receive & to give any information in my power. I write frequently: but receive few answers. Quaer, do my friends know that their letters would come to me on free cost? It is necessary that I should know in order to conform to the wishes of my Constituents; & I can say with great truth that I came here to serve them & not myself.   General Washington has lately been to the northward as the papers must have informed you. His object was partly to avoid the disagreeable situation in which he was; without a command--harrassed by daily applications without the means of granting any requests to his suffering & brave troops--and partly to survey the theatre of some of the most brilliant events during the war; but chiefly to make the necessary arrangements for taking possession of the British Posts on our northern frontier as soon as they should be evacuated. Baron Steuben is gone to Canada to demand the posts & to execute the necessary orders in that affair. It is thought necessary by many to keep up some garrison on those frontiers for the present; especially as no peace is yet concluded with the Indian nations who have joined the British in the late war. The Six Nations, or those of them who have been in arms against us, are anxious to make peace. The Oneidas & Canugas have in their behalf sent a Belt & a talk to General Schuyler at Saratoga, who has laid their application before Congress. The General in the mean time has written them friendly answer. He advises them immediately to restore to us all prisoners in their hands--to send four or five Sachems, with as many warriors of each nation, to attend a council fire at such place as he shall appoint, &c. The General is for making peace with them & suffering them to live on their own lands.  The Commander in chief was lately requested to attend on Congress as soon as might be convenient after his return from the northward. He arrived in this place last Saturday. He was welcomed by the Inhabitants by the display of colours & the firing of 13 cannon. He has recd an address from this Town & its vicinity & the President & faculty of the College, to which he returned a very suitable answer. Congress was desirous of conferring with the General on the peace establishment in contemplation as well as on the subject of Indian affairs.  You ought to be informed that a report now lies on our Table recommending an ample military establishment to be kept up in time of peace.(4) This has met with obstruction. The State of Rhode Island is not willing to establish a chain of forts to protect the western settlements of Virginia & other States against the Indians, which settlements are on lands which of right should belong to the U. S. and to protect N. York in the Fur trade, &c. Other States join us in this sentiment. We maintain that the Confederation gives Congress no power to make any military establishment in time of peace; however desireable such power might be, & that, if it be necessary for Congress, it is to be asked of the States. But a difficulty arises, if Congress have power to establish an army of 500, they may of 5000 men they being the only judges of the force necessary to answer the purpose: So that they may at any time increase their standing army to a size dangerous to the particular States & Employ such army to obtain additional powers or grants from the States. Especially if they should also be vested with the  power to levy, collect & Appropriate a permanent revenue in addition to that of raising men; for these two powers, Viz that of raising men at their pleasure & paying them without the yearly grants of the people, being both united in one body would render that body dangerous to the freedom of the particular States: & in time, however good & virtuous the present members of Congress may be supposed, that body might degenerate into lordly aristocrats.  The Gentlemen, who are most sanguine for this military establishment in time of peace, have also been most sanguine for inviting the General here & for conferring with the General on these heads. If they imagine him to be in favour of their plan I hope they may find themselves disappointed. I have ever reposed the utmost confidence in the Generals patriotism as well as in his military abilities. His circular letter I confess has alarmed me extremely. He has therein lent the advocates of the full influence of his name & character. Such an interference in civil matters I did not expect. It may be some Gentlemen expect to get the Sunshine of the Generals name also to a peace establishment. In this I hope they will fail: but should they succeed in this manoeuvr as in the other I shall only lament that the greatest man in the World should be left to give such evidence of his being but a man. In military measures I bow down to the General; but when he steps from the ground, I consider him only as a citizen; and whatever reverence I may always feel for that name, so dear to me, I shall take the liberty to his opinions as freely as I would count money after my Father--and should I find him wrong I dare say that all good men will applaud my caution.  This day having been previously appointed for a private audience with his Excellency. He came into town betwixt 11 & 12 from an house about 5 miles off, which had been previously engaged for him during his stay with us; at 12 O'clock he was introduced into the room where Congress was sitting, being the College library, by two members of Congress & conducted to a chair near, & on the right hand of the President. Agreeably to the established Etiquette the members kept their Seats without any gestures of Salutation, either on the Generals entring or leaving the room. The President sat in the same manner & covered. A short & suitable address was read to his Excellency by the President sitting & covered, the General standing & uncovered--to which his Excellency returned a proper answer & was then reconducted to the door. Congress then adjourned, the door was thrown open & the General his two aids, General Du Portail, Colonel Armant, &c. entred the room & received the compliments & cordial congratulations of the members of Congress. The members rising from their seats, walking the floor & joining in promiscuous conversation with their visitants. It was now about one O'Clock & the President informed the members that the General was going to his House & that  their company would be agreeable; whereupon the company filed off in parties & walked to the Presidents house about half a mile & spent an hour very agreeably in Company with the General & his suite. The General & his Suite then returned to his quarters & the members of Congress to their Lodgings to dinner, it being betwixt 2 & 3 O'Clock P. M. You will see the Presidents address & the Generals answer as well as these abovementioned in the public papers, to which I must refer you, not having copies.(5)  Sir Guy Carleton has lately informed Congress that he has received positive orders to evacuate New York; but that he is under the necessity of providing for the Security of the refugees, who daily increase, on account of the threatening publications in the Country--That being under the necessity of providing more transports to convey them to a place of Security than he expected the intended evacuation will be thereby retarded unless the fears of the refugees should be happily abated by the temperate proceedings of Congress, or of the States. Several members of Congress highly blame the proceedings of the people against the return of the refugees & you will soon see an earnest recommendation to the States to comply with the articles of the treaty in that respect: But (by the by) we do not expect it will have any effect, or that the refugees will return.  I pray you my good friend to be so kind as to present my respects to your good Lady & to all my acquaintance in the Town of New Port, who may enquire after my welfare--to my friends also in Narragansett, & particularly to your Brother Enoch Hazzard--to Mr. Jonathan Hazzard & to judge Phillipps.  You have my consent to shew this letter to any of your friends; or to make such use of it as you may see fit for the public good. I hope inaccuracies will be candidly excused as I write in haste & have not time to copy. Should the Genl. Assembly be convend before October, you will be so kind as to shew this Letter to such as you may think fit.  I have only to pray you to excuse me for writing you so long a Letter in so poor a hand; [...] myself [...] of Esteem. Your sincere friend & hble Servt, David Howell  P.S.

  Dear Hannah Wednesday Aug 27 1783  Yesterday I received your letter No. 1. and acknowledged the rect. of that dated Friday. The general had his Audience. I must inform you that before he arrived the etiquette for receiving him was settled as follows.(1) \""The General on receiving his Audience shall be introduced (it ought to have been expressed the General shall be introduced to his Audience) by two members & placed in a chair near and on the right hand of the president. The President to be covered and to speak to the general in his seat, and to receive his address sitting. The members of each state during the conference to sit together & keep their seats, uncovered as usual. The two first members present of the committee appointed to confer with him are to introduce the general.\"" The members being all seated and the President having heightened his seat [with] a large folio to give him an elevation above the rest, the general was introduced & upon entering the room bowed to the president & then to the members on the right & left who all returned the bow sitting. He was then conducted to his chair, but upon being addressed by the president he arose & stood while the president read the speech that had been prepared. As soon as it was finished, he made a reply & having finished he bowed to the president & members and immediately withdrew. I enclose a copy of the speech and the reply for your satisfaction. When you have read them please to seal them up and send them to Claypole as directed. AUGUST 27, 1783  Mr. Jones & Mr. Madison arrived yesterday afternoon. They inform me to my great satisfaction that our Assembly are proceeding with great wisdom and moderation & that they have determined to adopt the measures recommended by Congress for discharging the debts and supporting the honor and credit of the United states. This is not only sound wisdom & policy but it will be taking a noble revenge of those who wished to provoke them to rash measures. I am confident there are some who will be deeply wounded by this conduct, and I shall rejoice in proportion to the keenness of the pangs they feel. I really cannot form any opinion about the return of Congress. If public good or private convenience governed the votes of all the members it would be easy to form a judgment. I wish most sincerely to fall upon some plan that will make the time pass more agreeably to us both. You may be assured that the visit you mention was planned before & without any knowledge of or view to present circumstances. It was to avoid the rage of the dog star: as soon as that sets which will be next Monday week the visitant returns. I shall with great pleasure meet you at Bristol & have a room prepared for your reception. You will please to drive up to Bassonets.  I am much pleased with Robert's present plan & future prospects: so far from thinking him whimsical I consider him as a prudent man, fixed in his purpose to provide for his family and accommodating himself to circumstances as they arise. I think he would be to blame if he refused so advantageous an offer. It has my hearty approbation & I sincerely wish him success.  I thank you for your care of me and shall be much obliged for the jacket. What an amazing change in the weather! I am told you had a plentiful rain on Monday evening. We had none here. The wind was high and the lightening though distant appeared to be very sharp. I desired Bond, if he had occasion to go to the office, to call for the key; but I think it would have been best to have brought it back & left it with you. He passed through this place yesterday on his way to New york.(2) As the passengers dine at Brunswick, his stay was so short that I did not see him. William proceeds in his snail pace of copying. I have not had an Opportunity of examining his performances the two days past. But I think he will improve as much as if he were with Tod. We had heard of the death of Galloway but not of the marriage of his daughter. I would not wish her as much disappointment as her father experienced but if she be happy it will be more than she deserves.  Adieu my dear Hannah, take care of your health.

The honble Court having been pleas'd to appoint a committee \""to correspond with the Delegates,\""(1) therefore I consider it uncertain whether I shall have the honor of addressing your Excellency, with my Colleagues, upon public business, while I continue a member of Congress, and altho' the sense of my constituents signified to me will always be the rule of my conduct in their affairs; yet I can't find myself willing to omit doing myself the honor & pleasure of writing to your Excellency. General Washington sometime since signified to Congress that his situation was not very agreeable at head quarters while waiting for the definitive treaty, which caused an invitation from Congress to attend them in this place; he arrived here, with his lady & family, a few days since & on Tuesday last had a private audience with Congress, which is ordered to be published; but as we are at a distance from a printer, I do not expect to be able to forward it by this post; it seems the Genl. is determined to retire into private life as soon as the definitive treaty is concluded, or the British army leaves this Country.  The definitive treaty is not yet come to hand, & I consider it uncertain when it will, as our ministers at Paris in their last letters do not so much as mention it.  Great pains have been taken to prevail with Congress to return to Philada. but the members yet severely feel the situation they were in when surrounded by armed soldiers with fixed bayonets who seemed to be prepared for the worst purposes.

  Dear Sir, Princeton 29th Augt. 1783  I am much obliged by your kind favour of the 20th Instant,(1) and I can assure you that I shall consider myself richly repaid for any Letter I can possibly favour you with, by having the Satisfaction of a Line in return, if it goes no farther, than to inform me of the Health of Mrs. Livingston & family.  I wish I was able to give you any Satisfactory account of the definitive Treaty, which I am rather apprehensive is at a great Distance. The Conduct of our Citizens, by their resolves & violent Conduct, I am afraid will at least prevent any definitive Treaty from taking Place, if it does not precipitate us, altogether unprepared, into another War. We have not recieved a Line from our Plenepotentiaries since you left us, altho' we have had two or three separate ones on indifferent Subjects. The only one worth attending to, is from Mr. Laurens, dated the 18t June in London. He writes altogether relative to the Commercial Treaty, and says there seems to be a very different Conduct apparent in the English Ministry, than when he had formerly wrote. All is chicane & evasion--and no desire of coming to an Issue. He says that if there was but one Commissioner at Paris instead of four, let that one be either of the four, that a decent resentment would certainly be shewn at the Treatment they receive. He foretels the downfall of the present ministry & that shortly. He greatly complains of our Ships forcing a Trade with great Brittain without any commercial Stipulations on their Part. I communicate this Intelligence with Freedom, knowing you will treat it as confidential. But I must on the other Hand tell you of a Vessel having arrived from Barbadoes at Philadelphia in 13 days--who brings Letters & the Capt says, that the Day before she sailed, the Ariel frigate had arrived there from England, with advice that the definitive Treaty was signed the 22d July. It is possible, but not very probable, and the Tricks of Trade makes us yet doubt.  Your late department remains in Statu quo and I see no probability of its being filled, till we get a place of permanent residence. There is a prevailing design which will certainly be accomplished, of reducing the Salary to 3000 Dollars. No one is yet named (altho it is the order of the day for this Day to make the Choice) who I think stands the least Chance. I wish most heartily, you was back again, if it could be consistent with your Duty to your family. All our foreign matters remain exactly as you left them--not a resolution, report or determination more or less. I am the only Minister for foreign Affairs, and all I do is to keep the Commissioners informed &c. Mr Dana is like to do nothing & I believe has left Petersburgh by this Time. There is no disposition in Congress to do Business at this Place, tho' there are Ten States on the floor--still nothing is done.  AUGUST 29, 1783  As to the future destination of Congress, you know, it is almost as easy to tell the future Course of the winds. However if I may venture a Conjecture, I believe the struggle will be, between New York and New Jersey. I am apt to think some Village in Jersey near N York would be prefered. I sent your Letter by a safe Hand to Mr. Marbois, so that he must have recd it.  The medal I wrote you about, is at Philadelphia otherwise I should have sent it long since.  Sir Guy is at last about leaving the City, altho' he says the number of Refugees thrown on his Hands by the severity of our People, will detain him much longer than he wished, as he cannot think of leaving them to the Mercy of a People who have but little Government among them--tho these are not his words, they are clearly contained in his Meaning.  Now for a few words on my own private Business. Mrs. Boudinot has an unhappy Sister, who was Married to a Man that behaved very ill in this part of the Country when possessed by the british. He went off with them and Genl. Putnam insisted on her following her husband. He left her in New York & went for Scotland, where he remains and has left her to shift for herself. His whole Estate is forfeited & sold here. She is extremely distressed lest she should be insulted when our People take possession of the City. Shall I beg the favour of you in Behalf of an unhappy woman, to give her so much Countenance when you go into the City, as to prevent any insult or Injury being unnecessarily offered her. She takes in Gentlemen to board at present, and I suppose intends to continue it. Her Name is Mrs. Cochran and lives in King Street No. 19. I wish you to mention this also to General McDougal in my Name, as I know his humanity will lead him to oblige me.  Mrs. Boudinot & Miss Susan who does not so easily forget her Beaux, desire to be remembered to Mrs. Livingston & yourself in a very particular Manner--forgive this Scrawl as I am sure the reading will be a high Price for it.

  Dear Sir. Princeton, 29th Augt. 1783.  I hope mine of the 18th of June with the inclosures came safe to hand, since which I have not been favored with any of yours.  You'll permit me to congratulate you, on your being appointed to a seat in Congress,(1) & may I not be permitted to consider you as my suc- AUGUST 29, 1783  cessor, when I assure you that I know not the person that would have been more agreeable to me; the Honorble Court having thought proper to make a considerable change in the persons that are to represent them in Congress, it gives me Sensible pleasure to find that the Gentell Gentlemen that are elected, are men that have been firm in the cause of their Country from the beginning of the contest; & I have not the least doubt but they will be as attentive to the honor & interest of their constituents, as the Gentlemen I have had the honor to serve with, & as careful of the national faith and independence of the united States; however they will have great difficulties to encounter notwithstanding the war to be over. The definitive treaty has been expected for some time past but from the latest accounts that I have seen from Europe, I can't but say, that my expectations are much abated, and I shall not look for it 'till I hear further, for the last letters from our ministers at Paris, do not so much as mention it; and I believe a commercial treaty with G.B. or her imperial majesty is not much sooner to be expected than the definitive. However I feel myself too independent to sollicite favors of this kind, even of her imperial majesty. Great pains have been taken to prevail with Congress to return to Philada. & upon the question whether we shou'd adjourn to that City, but two states appeared in favor of a return, & one divided; but 'tis difficult to get sufficient accommodation here, the members yet sensibly feel the situation they were in, when surrounded by armed Soldiers with fixed bayonets, who seemed to be prepared for the worst purposes. By a late letter from Sir Guy Carleton it appears that he has orders to leave N.Y. but complains that he is greatly embarrassed by so large a number of the citizens of N.Y. being obliged to leave this Country, which he supposes is partly owing to the proceedings of many people in town meetings, &c. &c. and that he can't in justice leave those people behind if they incline to go, altho' it may prolong the time of the evacuation beyond his instructions.  I find that it is the opinion of some persons that commutation was not the only reason that operated against the reelection of some of us to a seat in Congress, and that some change was thought necessary in the present state of our affairs; yet I have no doubt after what I have heard, but commutation operated in the minds of a majority that voted but had it the same weight with our best politicians; I shou'd suppose not: however you Sir, being present, & well acquainted with the secrets of state, can form a better Judgment.

  My dear Sir Princeton Aug. 30. 1783.  We hear nothing from Europe that can be depended on relative to the definitive Treaty, nor any thing from N. York as to the time of its evacuation. A Pamphlet has lately come over from G. Britain which appears to be well adapted to retard if not prevent a commercial Treaty, & which is said to be much attended to.(1) It urges an adherence to the principle of the Navigation Act by which American Vessels will be excluded from the trade between the separate parts of the Empire, and from all intercourse with the dependent territories. It undertakes to shew from an enumeration of the produce of the U.S. & the manufactures consumed by them, that those of G. B. recommended by the superior credit which her merchants can give, will be sufficiently sure of a preference in the American Market. And lastly it maintains that the interests of the States are so opposite in matters of Commerce, & the authority of Congs. so feeble that no defensive precautions need be feared on the part of the U.S. and threatens that in case they should refuse to let British Vessels exclusively carry on a Commerce between the U.S. and the W. Indies as far as the interest of the Islands may require, the Vessels of one State shall not be permitted to carry the produce of another to any British Port. The whole tenor of the reasoning supposes that France will not permit Vessels of the U.S. to trade with their Islands, in which there is good reason to believe they are not mistaken. The object of the French Administration is said to be to allow a direct trade between the U.S. & their W. India possessions, but to confine it to French Bottoms.  AUGUST 30, 1783  The Legislature of Penna. have unanimously adopted the Recommendations of Congs. both as to Revenue & a change of the fOEderal rule for apportioning the common burdens.(2) They will also present an invitation to Congs. we understand, to resume their Sessions at Philada. if that place be judged most fit for the despatch of public business untill a permanent Seat be chosen & prepared; giving at the same time explicit assurances of support in case it should on any occasion be needed.(3) What effect this conciliatory proposition may have on the temper of Congs. is precarious. With some the complaisance shewn to the late recommendations of Congs. will be far from softening the dislike. With others Philada. will ever be obnoxious while it contains and respects an obnoxious Character.(4) Annapolis has siezed the present occasion to forward her views with respect to Congs. and has courted their presence in the most flattering terms.(5) During this contest among the rival seats, we are kept in the most awkward situation that can be imagined; and it is the more so as we every moment expect the Dutch Ambassador. We are crowded too much either to be comfortable ourselves or to be able to carry on the business with advantage. Mr. Jones & myself on our arrival were extremely put to it to get any quarters at all, and are at length put into one bed in a room not more than 10 feet square.  ""

  [August ? 1783](1) In answer to the letter from Masstts. I shou'd suppose that these ideas might with propriety be held up to them, in answer to the half pay to the officers or commutation, that when half pay for seven years was promised them & after wards extended for life, that no doubt it was thought by Congress to be the best thing that could be devised at that time to keep the army together in the then embarrasd state of our affairs, not having money or public credit sufficient to support our just cause, & that the present Congress, finding that the promises had been made them & the faith of the united state[s] pledged to make them good, were of opinion that a reasonable commutation would be for the honor & interest of the future union, and more agreeable to the states in general.  With regard to the salaries of civil officers, it may be observed that the necessaries of life have been very high during the war & particularly so where the public have wanted their business done, & notwithstanding the salaries that have been given it has been difficult for Congress to get Genm of character to remove to the place where they have sit to attend to public business & for this reason they have been obliged to appoint more Genm living near where the public business has been done; but however there may be some instances where the AUGUST, 1783  Salaries might be lowered, now hostilities have ceased, & the charges of living less.

  Dear Sir, Prince Town Augst. 1783.  Contrary to my Expectation I am Obliged to attend Congress at this Place in the stead of Generall Scott who says his health will not permit his leaving home. It will be much against my Interest to continue here under my present Circumstances, but as I was in the Delegation I could not with Honour refuse giving my Attendance. A few Days before I left home I was favoured with your Letter informing (to my surprise) that the Commissioners had refused to comply with their Engagements to me respecting the Apprisement of the Land. I think no further Evidence is wanting to shew their Partiality and Interestedness. I am fearful that no Proff [Proof] that we can give respecting the former Owners of the Land, 'tho ever so clear, will leave any Effect upon them. Whoever our Opponents are it is evident that they mean to weary us out and Oblige to withdraw our Location. I wrote to you1 the Measures I had taken to procure Information I hope you may have received it by this Time. I sent to Colo Floyd also(1) and desired him to obtain what information he could. I have by this Conveyance wrote to judge Rall1 on the subject and requested him to transmit to you any Information he may have received. While [he] is exceeding Anxious to have this Land apprised & divided so that he may remove on it this fall as he thinks it will not do to make a Settlement at Onondago this year.  I observe what you mention about the soldier's Rights. As the Donation depends only on a Resolution of the last Assembly, tis a wonder if AUGUST, 1783  this kind of Sale, if known to the Legislature, does not intirely defeat the Expectation of our Line & the good Intentions of the former Legislature.

  Dr Sir,(1) Phila.(2) Sept. 1st. 1783 I take the liberty to inclose to you, three tickets indorsed with my brother's name,(3) which he says are prizes; one with the name of my Aunt, and four with my name the fate of which we know not. I would be much obliged to you if you would examine into this matter, and receive the money for my brothers' tickets, if they should have drawn prizes of a low value; otherwise a certificate. If my Aunt's ticket or any of mine should have drawn prizes please to receive the money or certificates as they may be entitled.  We received your observations and shall make a proper use of them. No report has yet been made, on the report on your questions.(4) Great bodies move slow. Mr. Howell hath received a letter from Dr. Arnold, dated Augt. 18th, in which he mentions that Mrs. Arnold, who was at his quarters, presented her compliments to him; in a letter to me, which was bro't by the same hand, and was dated Augt. 12th, he says Miss Crawford is in an enterprizing state of health and I have the pleasing expectation that my next will announce her arrival at my quarters.  From hence we conclude that they have committed matrimony, that She hath been at, and he in her quarters, and that by this time you might take up either of his feet. Oh Jonathan! Oh!  The Appearance of the Genl. and the Minister of France in, and the passage of two of the regiments which some time since went to Philadelphia, through this town, have added a brilliancy to it, and enliven'd the inhabitants; who do every thing they can to accommodate us. Our market flourishes, our streets are levelled, houses are repairing and building, and things look as if Princeton would become the fixed residence of Congress. I believe it will be difficult to move Congress from hence. All the States, including Pennsylvania, to the Southward must be present & united in order to effect a removal. I expect Pennsylvania will hold out some magnificent offer to Congress; but it will not do; The political air of that State, at present, doth not suit northern constitutions, and the influence of the great city is too powerful and extensive.  If you have any thing new please to communicate it. Present my regards to Mr. Marshall, to his wife and children & to Mr. Mumford; and to Mrs. Gibbons and her amiable daughter.

 Connecticut Delegates to Jonathan Trumbull, Sr. Sir, Princeton, Septr 2d. 1783.  We had the Honor to Receive your Excellency's Letter of the 23d of August & Observed the Contents. We have no Important News of late from abroad and but little at home.  Several weighty Matters are in agitation in Congress and but slow Progress made. Seldom more than seven or eight States assembled and one or two Dissenting Voices are fatal to all Proceedings.  The States of New Jersy & Mariland have granted the five Per Cent Duty on Importation. Pennsylvania have done the same and Instructed their Delegates to Subscribe the Proposed Alteration in the Confederation.(1) They have also Desired the Return of Congress to their Capital and Promised to Enable their Executive Council to Afford a Desired Protection in their State untill the Place of Permanent Residence of Congress shall be fixed.(2) The Massachusetts have Addressed Congress on the Subject of the Commutation and high Sallaries as Obstacles in the Way of a Compliance on their Part with the Requisition of an Impost,(3) whilst they and Rhode Island are Collecting Duties on Trade in their own way and applying the Monies so Raised to the Payment of their own Quotas. The Burthen of this being sustained by the Consumer must be Eventually Borne by the Industrious Inhabitants of our State in Proportion to the Goods we Purchase from them whilst we have our whole Quota to Pay without an Equal Advantage of a Tax upon Commerce. This Naturally suggests to us the Necessity of Promoting Trade in our own State and withdrawing it from those States whose Policy is as much as Possible to lay their Burthens SEPTEMBER 2, 1783  on us. This also is a Striking Proof of the Equitable Nature of a General Impost and of the Injustice that will take Place in Consequence of the Local and Illiberal Measures that will be Adopted by the Several States in their Separate Proceedings tending to Disaffection, Animosity and Disunion.  That the Superintending Power of Divine Government over the Affairs of Men Cannot be baffled by Designing Mortals is a most Consoling Truth to the Confident Heart.  We Shall be at the Assembly before the Session Ends in Octor if our Attendence here can be Dispensed with.

Yesterday Congress received a Letter from Sir Guy Carleton,(3) together with the proceedings of a Court martial held in New York, for the trial of persons charged with counterfeiting & passing Mr. Morriss's Notes, & other continental paper currency, two persons, one a refugee, the other a Britton, were reported to Mr. Carleton as concerned in this nefarious business; in consequence whereof, the refugee will be turned out of the City that the United States may take him, if the[y] can, the other will be detained.

  Dear Sir, Princetown, Sept. 3, 1783.  We have been favoured with your Answer to our Letter respecting Mrs. Delancey, which seems to be satisfactory to Mr. Izard.(1) Tis likely by this Conveyance you will receive our official Answer to your other Letter respecting the Settlements of the Public Accounts, & Garrisoning the Posts. We have wrote to Mr. Morris and expect his answer to Day.(2) We have also wrote to Colos. Floyd & Hamilton(3) to make the Report as we were not here, when that Business was under Consideration. A few Evenings before the Receipt of your Excellencys Letter, I was informed by My Colleague that such an Instructions had been left with him by Colo. Hamilton who received the same early from the Legislature and had suppressed it, so that it had not been known to any Person in Congress, he having determined that it was best for the state that the Posts should be garrisoned with Continental Troops. Whether Colo. Floyd was acquainted with the Instructions I am not able to learn. It was new to me. I having left the Assembly before the same was agreed on.  I was observing that I found many of the States disposed to have the frontier Posts garrisoned by the States in whose Territory they were, and not by the Continent, and that I should be glad to know the Sense of the State as it was probable this Question would turn up on discussing the Peace Arrangement, upon which the observation was made as above, and we then agreed as soon as an Opportunity presented to procure a Resolution agreable to the Instructions as we supposed we had no right to Judge of the Propriety, of a Measure directed by the Legislature. No Possession will be taken of those Posts till next Spring, and 'tis thought by some they will not be given up under a Year.  Halderman has refused to permit Baron Stuben even to visit the Posts, alledging that he had received no Orders for evacuating them.(4) I think it necessary to mention what has been communicated to me in confidence, that the State of Virginia have it in Contemplation when- SEPTEMBER 4, 1783  ever an Opportunity presents to take Possession of Niagara, on Pretence that the Posts with Lands to the eastward of it are within the Limits of that State. Except that State makes a Cession of Vacant Lands to the United States, there is too much Reason to believe they will endeavour to carry this Plan into Execution.  I am glad to find it will be in your Power to supply me with Money. I cannot determine how long I shall continue here, tho' I think I shall stay 'till the British leave New York, which Event I expect will take place sometime in October. As I brought some money with me, I believe about 200 Dollars will answer my purpose; the Remainder you can keep in your Hands till such Time as I may want--it will be disagreable to apply to the Legislature hereafter; if no opportunity presents to send the Money, I can borrow it here or possibly give an Order for the same.  I have sent my Accounts to the Auditor(5) with Directions (if he can Audit them without my being present) to transmit them to your Excellency. Congress still continue here & I think there is a greater Probability of their going Southward than Northward.  With the utmost Respect I am, Sir, your Excellencys most Obed't. Serv't.

  Dear sir.(1) Princeton, State of New Jersey, 4th Sepr. 1783.  I shall make no apology for this address, farther than assuring you that personal respect is my principal motive.  As I know of no person that gives greater attention to public business, & preserves State papers better than your honor; I inclose you the pamphlet contain'g the address & recommendations of Congress to the several states, respecting our finances.(2) The difficulties Congress have had to encounter in the course of the war, can be better conceived of by you, than expressed by me, but from my personal knowledge, they have been very great, and at some periods of the war, they appeared to be almost insurmountable; and I consider that at such a period as I have last mentioned, Congress were  SEPTEMBER 4, 1783  obliged to promise the officers of their army half pay for life, if they would continue in their service to the end of the war, and one years full pay to each private; I have said obliged, I mean, that, at that time it was thought, by Congress & general Washington, the best thing that could be done to keep the army together, & after the greatest deliberation, as the officers were endeavoring, in large numbers, to resign their commissions; but if Congress at that time, could have commanded money sufficient, or procured credit, it might have answered the purpose, by paying them their wages, that was then due, but that not being the case, they were obliged to promise, & pledge the faith & honor of their constituents to make them good. This leads me to consider what the present Congress has done, that is so disagreeable to my constituents; as very few of the members that now compose Congress were concerned in making the engagements to the army, & not one of us from Massachusetts; And when the officers had reason to think that the war was drawing to a close, they made application to Congress, setting forth their services, sufferings, & the promises that had been made them, & requesting payment, or some further security to be given them; and as they understood that some of the states in the union, did not consider half pay for life, in a favorable point of light, that they were willing to make a commutation & settle the matter; The delegates from Massachusetts, supposing that a commutation with them, would be much more agreeable to their constituents, and in favor of their interest, for several reasons that might be mentioned, took great pains to find out what would become their due according to the common period of mens lives, & finding that 22 years upon a average was the time that all seemed to be agreed in, that they would live, therefore, we should have to pay them, 22 years half pay or eleven years full pay, & then, after great deliberation it was thought adviseable to offer them 5 years full pay, in such securities as Congress give their other creditors, which you will take notice is less than one half of what would become their due, according to our own cost; And now, sir, I submit the matter to your judgment, and every other honest man, that is acquainted with the subject, whether the present Congress have made a good bargain, & how far the delegates from Massachusetts have been to blame in assenting to the same; but it is sd. that Massachusetts is not in favor of half pay, commutation, or any thing else, except their wages, if so, I have to lament, that They did not signify their pleasure, by instructions to their delegates, which would have been the rule of my conduct, & I should not then have considered myself personally answerable for the consequences.  There seems to be something peculiar, respecting the settlement with the army, as it respects, the delegates from Massachusetts, for about the same time that their constituents were signifying their disapprobation of their conduct, part of the army, were so dissatisfied as to SEPTEMBER 5, 1783  surround the house where Congress were assembled, & placed guards at their doors, for several hours, because no more had been done for them, and I assure you, sir, our situation, for some time, was disagreeable, as the soldiers seemed to be prepared for the worst purposes.

  Dear Mrs. Huntington Princeton Septr 8th 1783 Since my Last(1) Nothing Material has hapned. A Dutch Minister is Dayly Expected to arrive in Philadelphia and it was Rumoured that Some of his furniture was arrived last Week. This must be a Wonderful great Affair, and what Congress can Do with this Great Personage in Princeton is more than Humane Wisdom can Devise for there are not Buildings sufficient to House more Dons nor in Indeed as many as are Already here. Some are under Necessity to Go to Philadelphia once or Twice a fortnight to Breath in Polite Air. The Country so badly agrees with those Sublime & Delicate Constitutions that it is to be feared that many of them will Contract a Rusticity that Can never be wholly purged off. We have nothing here but the Necessaries and Comforts of Life and who can live so? The agreeables of the City cannot be had in the Country. I Expect no Business of Importance will be done untill Congress Returns to that Sweet Paridice from which they hastily took Flight in June last Since which Time an Awkard Rustication has been their Painful Situation on an Eminence in the Country where they have no Musquetoes to Serenade them in bed and in the Day they have a Prospect of no more than 30 or 40 Miles to the High Lands or the Sea Coast nor can they hear the Musick of Carts and Waggons on the Pavements in the City nor See the motly Crouds of Beings in those Streets. This must be Truely Distressing to Gentlemen of Taste. The Ladies make less Complaint than the Gentlemen and the Gentlemen who have their Ladies here seem in some Degree Contented. The President of Congress who Belongs in the Jersy is obliged to leave his Lady in Philadelphia to Keep Possession but has the Promise of a Very Genteel House here if he will take it but not Knowing whether Congress will abide in Princetown or not, he is at the utmost Loss what to Do, Whether it is best for him and his wife to live together as Peasants do in the Country or for her to be at Philada as the Ladies do, and for him to Live as a Gentleman Doing Business in the Country in hopes of Returning to the Pleasures and Amusements of the SEPTEMBER 8, 1783  City when Business is over. This Matter Requiring Great Deliberation Cannot (like the Emigration of Congress in June last) be hastily Determined. Thus you See we Great Folks are not without Trouble. I hope to become a small man in a few Weeks and Retire from the Embarrassments of Dignity to the Plain & Peaceful Possessions of a Private Life not Desiring to Live without Business, but to do useful Business without the Pomp & Vanity of this Wicked World. All I have Wrote is not what I Designed when I began & Consequently have not yet advanced one Step toward my Design and having nothing to Write About am at a Great Loss what to Write because it Requires more Strength of Genius to Build an Hansom Fabrick without Materials than with. I am Spending Money very fast but not so fast as I Could with the Same Degree of Industry in Philadelphia & it is a Mortifying Consideration that my Cash is Spent for no better Purposes, but the Great & General Concerns of a Nation must [be] Attended to and the Fashions & Customs of the World are Such as Require it to be Done with Expence. A new Fashion is among the Ladies here which is the Same as at Philada. The Roll is much less than formerly and is Raised to a Peak on their Forehead Frowzled & Powdered and they wear Mens Beaver Hats with a Large Tye of Gauze like a Sash or Mourning Wead about the Crown & Decorated with Feathers & Plumes on the Top which makes a very Daring Appearance. The Brim of the Hat is Tapred before about as low as their Eyes and is a Kind of Riding Hat, they Walk Abroad and Sit in Church in the same. Some have them in the Same Figure made of Paper and Covered with Silk with Deep Cravices as a Beaver Hat but as this is much out of the Line of Business I was sent here to do I have not been very Particular on the Subject. I might also mention the Waistcoat and Long Sleaves much like the Riding habits our Ladies wore Twenty five years ago but as they Differ some from them & having no Right to be very Much in Observation upon the Ladies I am not able to say much on the Subject.

The laws here do not admit of his being sold for more than 7 years. I do not expect to get near the worth of him; but cannot think of punishing him by transportation merely for coveting that liberty for which we have paid the price of so much blood, and have proclaimed so often to be the right, & worthy the pursuit, of every human being.

  Dear Sir Philada. Sepr. 8. 1783.  Your favor of the 1st.(1) found me here whither Mr. Jones & myself had been called by some private business for a day or two. I thank you for your remarks on the jurisdiction necessary for Congress within the limits which may be ceded for their permanent residence. They seem to comprise all the alternatives among which a choice is to be made.  We have recd, no advices from Europe since my last.(2) The light in which Sr. G. Carlton places his delay in evacuating N.Y. will be seen in the inclosed paper. He has made report to Congs. of the result of inquiry into the forgery of Morris' Notes, which did not capitally convict any of the authors of the villany but brought forth all the implements made use of not only for that purpose, but for the various forgeries which have issued from N.Y. in the course of the war, and fully verify the charges on that head. These implements were sent to Congress with the Trial. The accused pleaded the countenance of authority for former experiments in this way, and wonder'd at the change of system which had dictated prosecutions for the present. You will wonder I  SEPTEMBER 8, 1783  Dare say at the facility with which Sr. G. C. has exposed the dishonorable but no doubt secret measures of his predecessors. His military powers might easily have stifled the enquiry & discoveries if he had chosen to do so.(3) The Legislature of this State have in addition to the other steps rehearsed in the inclosed, made German Town a Candidate for the permanent abode of Congress.(4) The Eastern States are in great perturbation on the subject of the half pay.

  My dear Sir Philada. Sepr. 8. 1783.  Mr. Jones & myself having come down to this City the end of the past week for the purpose of negociating some pecuniary matters, I am here to date my acknowledgment of your favor of the 30th ulto.(1) We return again tomorrow.  The delay of the definitive Treaty altho not fully explained to Congress, excites less disquietude here than I find it does in Virginia. Our latest official advices were from Mr. Laurens of the day of June.(2) The Conduct of the British administration was far from explic[i]t, according to his State of it, but probably proceeded more from the discordant materials of which it is composed & doubts as to the commercial footing on which America ought to be placed, than from any insidious views. Why indeed a Commercial Treaty should be made to clog the Treaty of peace is left to conjecture. Perhaps the fact may not be true & the delay of the latter may be owing still to the old cause, to wit, a discussion of the intricate points with the Dutch. The situation of G.B. is such that nothing but some signal change in the aspect of things in this hemisphere can inspire a fresh disposition for war; notwithstandg the menacing tone of Sr. G. Carlton.  SEPTEMBER 8, 1783  The Legislature of Pa. have taken every possible step to expiate the default of the Executive short of an impeachment of its members, which the rigor of some members of Congs. included among the terms of reconciliation with the State. They have expressly invited Congs. back, assured them of honorable protection, and given up the State-House with the appendages for their temporary use.(3) They have also made German Town a competitor for the permanent abode of Congress.  The opposition in the N. England States to the Grant of half pay instead of subsiding has increased to such a degree as to produce almost a general anarchy. In what shape it will issue is altogether uncertain. Those who are interested in the event look forward with very poignant apprehensions. Nothing but some continental provision can obtain for them this part of their reward.  The lady whose husband makes a subject of one of your paragraphs has lately recd. letters from him which breathe a warm affection for her,(4) state the impracticability of his coming for her, or leaving that Country altogether at present, and press her to lose no time in getting to him, which she means to attempt in the course of next month. Some traits in his character which were related to you, have come to my knowledge through other channels, particularly his attachment to pelf; But in other respects he has been represented as a man of honesty & worth. His Medical profession is not entirely usurped, being founded on a partial education in that line. My friendship for her estimable qualities makes me regret upon the whole that her prospect of happiness is not more flattering. The removal of Congress has been of some disadvantage to the old Lady,(5) but the established reputation of her House will always command the means of support. She has lately too had the good fortune to have with her one of her sons whom she had not heard of for 4 or 5 years. He has engaged to accompany his sister in her voyage to her husband.  Why did not the Assembly stop the sale of land warrants? They bring no profit to the public Treasury, are a source of constant speculation on the ignorant, and will finally arm numbers of Citizens of other States & even foreigners with claims & clamors against the faith of Virginia. Immense quantities have from time to time been vended in this place at immense profit, and in no small proportion to the subjects of our Ally. The credulity here being exhausted I am told the land Jobbers are going on with their commodity to Boston & other places to [....](6)  ""

  Sir, Princeton Sepr. 8th. 1783.(1)  Altho' the definitive treaty of peace has not yet arrived; yet the latest intelligence from Europe warrants a full confidence in the good State of our affairs. A treaty of Amity and Commerce has been lately ratified in Congress betwixt the United States and the King of Sweden.(2) This treaty was concluded at Paris on the third day of April 1783; and is of the same tenor with those enterd in to with France and Holland.  His Danish Majesty has directed his minister, residing at Paris, to enter into a negotiation with the minister of the United States respecting a treaty of amity and commerce.(3) The Emperor of Morocco has sent an Envoy to Paris for the express purpose of establishing an intercourse and friendship betwixt the United States and those on the coast of Barbary.(4) It is hoped that beneficial consequences to the trade of the United States in the Mediterranean will result from this measure.  The Elector of Saxony has also discovered his good disposition towards the United States and readiness to establish a permanent friendship with us.  By a letter from Mr. Carmichael dated Madrid March 13th--it appears that he has been at length received at that Court in his public character as ChargÄ des Affairres in the absence of Mr. Jay, and has had the honor of dining with the Corps Diplomatique at the table of the Count de Florida Blanca.(5) SEPTEMBER 8, 1783  By a letter from Mr. Laurens dated London June 17th 1783--it appears that Mr. Hartley was not in fact cloathed with any power to conclude a treaty of commerce with us.(6) His object seems to have been only to sound the minds of our ministers and to make report. The British aim to obtain some preference in our trade; but we trust they will be disappointed. For it is the policy of Congress to be at amity and to have a free trade with all the world. The System of the British is so extensive and complicated, that it is not easy to see how all its branches will be affected by the Independance of this Country; nor to form the arrangements necessary on their part to secure themselves as far as practicable in a treaty of commerce with us.  They have cloathed their King in Council with a sort of discretionary power for opening trade with us, and mean to take time to judge of measures by their operation.  By a letter from Mr. Dana dated St. Petersburg April 28th 1783(7)--it appears that he has not been received at that Court in his public character. On receiving intelligence of the signing of the preliminary articles of peace betwixt the courts of London and Versailles, whereby the provisional articles betwixt Great-Britain and the United States took effect, Mr. Dana presented a memorial to his Excellency the Count de Osterman, Vice Chancellor of her Imperial Majesty, the only result was to draw out the objections of that court to his reception. The Count informed him that her Imperial Majesty could not, consistent with the strict principles of neutrality which she had prescribed to herself, receive a minister from the United States; unless his letters of credence bore date subsequent to the recognition of their Independence by Great-Britain and subsequent to the reception of an American minister at the Court of London, and subsequent also to her Imperial Majesty's acknowledging their Independence. To these very extraordinary objections Mr. Dana replied in substance, that to issue new letters of Credence to him would go to annulling all our acts of Sovereignty in the course of the war, and all our treaties, and would in fact be a confession that we held our Independence as a grant from the Crown of G. Britain or as a stipulation in the treaty of peace, a confession most humiliating and disgraceful to the United States, and which our affairs by no means require. We are not as yet acquainted with the effects of this reply.  The perusal of the letters and journals of our ministers plenipotentiary at Paris during their negotiations for peace have afforded great satisfaction, and fully convinced us of the skill and abilities as well as integrity with which our most important political affairs in Europe have been conducted. It is greatly to be wished that on a general settlement of our accounts in Europe our pecuniary transactions may do equal honor to the parties concerned therein. It is in contemplation to reduce the number of our servants in Europe immediately after the  arrival of the definitive treaty. A Minister at the Court of Versailles and another at the Court of London, with a competent number of Consuls in the principal marts of trade in Europe will, in our opinion, answer every desireable purpose.  Since the adjournment of Congress to this place, little business has been done. This may be ascribed partly to the confusion necessarily following such an event; but principally to an incomplete representation from the States. Sometimes Congress have adjourned for want of seven States. Nine are seldom on the floor at once. According to ConfOEderation nine States are necessary in most business of importance, and unanimity is scarce to be expected in resolves that require either seven or nine States.  It may be thought uncandid to suggest that the incomplete representation in the house has been owing to the reluctance of certain persons to do business here; but it is a fact that the States of Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland have been frequently unrepresented. New-Hampshire and Georgia have not been represented since we took our Seats in Congress.  The State has been informed that the 4th day of October(8) next is assigned for fixing on a suitable place for the permanent residence of Congress. Your delegates could have wished for particular instructions on this question which is of importance not only to the present but to future generations.  The State of New Jersey has some good claim to the great prize, whether you consider its situation, which is nearly in the centre of the population and wealth of the United States, the decided part she has taken in the late war together with her republican principles and manners; or the healthiness of the climate.  As New-Jersey is not calculated for extensive trade & commerce the probability is that she will the longer persevere in those OEconomical manners, a departure from which so necessarily follows the excessive riches and luxury of commercial States, her comparative smallness too will forbid all jealousy of her extending any dangerous influence into the great, national council. It may be also observed in favor of this very spot where we are cast, without any premeditated design in human counsels, that it is remarkably high, commanding and healthful, that it is situated at about an equal distance from the navigable waters leading to the great cities of New-york & Philadelphia; and that its central position betwixt those great cities, which hereafter may be the heads of two different interests, will prevent either of them from a prevailing influence in the national counsels and thus destroy those seeds of discord which in time might sprout and endanger the public safety.  It not being probable that seven States will soon agree in any one place for the permanent residence of Congress, your delegates flatter themselves that there will be time enough for them to receive your in-  structions on that head before it will be determined, and wish only to submit the foregoing observations for consideration.  His Excellency Genl. Washington is yet attending at Congress. Their address to him on his audience points out the principal object for which he was requested to attend. It hath been made a question \""whether any and what powers are vested in Congress by the confOEderation for making and supporting a peace establishment.\""(9) Since the arrival of the preliminary articles much time has been spent on this subject. It has been under the consideration of a committee and a long and a learned report has been made. As this report hath not been acted upon we beg leave to refer you to our friend and Colleague Mr. Arnold for the particulars of which it consists, the principles on which it is grounded and the objects to be thereby obtained.  The Committee appointed to confer with the Commander in chief on this subject has had an interview with him; but as yet have not reported. In the opinion of your delegates if such power in Congress should be thought necessary for the good of the Union, it is yet to be asked for and obtained of the particular States. It is much to be regretted that this application had not accompanied that for an Impost; especially as they seem so naturally connected, The Impost being necessary to pay off the standing army, and the standing army being so necessary to secure an effectual collection of the Impost.  It is unhappy that the principles of the ConfOEderation are not more attended to. The power of levying and collecting monies from the citizens of these States by taxes, or imposts and excises is retained in the several States and not vested in Congress as will appear by the 4th, 6th, 8th, and------articles of the ConfOEderation but Congress have discovered a persevering disposition to take this power out of the hands of the particular States and to exercise it themselves. No power is given to Congress to keep up a standing army in time of peace; on the contrary, the military force, if any, in time of peace is to be under the direction of the particular States. Congress have only the power of checking them in this respect and of determining the quantity of force, the number of ships and garrisons which the States shall not exceed; but Congress are not to have the command of that force, nor of those ships, nor garrisons, nor are they to be kept up and supported at the General expence. For the verification of these positions we appeal to the 5th article of ConfOEderation.  Had the power in question been vested in Congress, from the nature of it, they would have been the sole judges of the exercise of it, and nothing but their own moderation, or the want of funds to defray the expense could restrain them from the most dangerous use of it. They might augment a standing army from two to four or to forty thousand men at their pleasure, to overawe an uncomplying State, to enforce an impost or to obtain an excise.   It ought further to be observed that the provision in ConfOEderation is not only grounded in the danger to be apprehended to the particular States from a military power in the hands of Congress in time of peace; but it is also grounded on substantial principles of justice. For may it not be demanded with the greatest propriety why the States of Rhode Island, New-Jersey, or Delaware should be at the expense of maintaining a chain of Forts from Niagara to the Missisippi to secure the fur trade of New York or the back Settlements of Virginia? \""Qui sentit commodum sentire debet et onus\"" is a maxim as good as it is old,(10) and strictly applicable to this case. If indeed the States pretending claims, tho' against all reason, to those vast western territories would make cessions of such claims to Congress, a common interest therein might justify a common expence in protecting the trade and settlements of that country; but until such an event, the States claiming those lands have no more right to charge the United States with the expence of protecting the inhabitants against the Indians, until a solemn war shall take place, than with the expense of defending them against the wild beasts that may infest that country.  Agreeably to instructions your delegates have embraced every opportunity to enforce the claims of the States to a proportionate share in the back lands. The subject has been before a Committee and a proclamation has been reported \""prohibiting all persons from making settlements on lands without the limits or jurisdiction of the particular States, and from making purchases or accepting cession of such lands of the Indians, and declaring such purchases or cessions null and void.\""(11) It is hoped that this proclamation will be agreed to and that it will prove useful. It will at least be a setting up a title to some lands and will very naturally bring on the question of the western limits of particular States. These limits may be ascertained two ways either 1st by cessions of claims of particular States, which is most eligible, in the form of the N. York cession which was accepted last year; or 2nd by a resolve of Congress limiting our guarantee to the particular State. The general guarantee contained in the 2nd and 3d articles of confOEderation ought to have a reasonable construction which is not to be made by the particular State; but by the United States in Congress assembled. For example, should Georgia extend her claims southward or westward so as to encroach on the Spanish territories, or should any State extend its claims to the injury of a neighbour, Congress being the dernier resort of justice in such cases would undoubtedly determin how far they will guarantee to such particular State; and also determin how far they will justify the particular States in extending their claims westward, and how far the arms of the United States shall vindicate such claims. Let the line of guarantee be determined (and if the States should not speedily make liberal cessions agreeably to the resolve of Sept. 6, 1780 it ought to be done) and let a continental land-  office be opend, States, counties and towns laid out, and it cannot be doubted that purchasers enough will appear: the public securities would be bought up, Public credit revived and no injustice done to any one. This latter mode of procedure would square with reason and justice and not oppugn confOEderation: the former however would be preferable as being most conciliatory; and ought to be attempted. To this end it is proposed to send Virginia our objections to her cession and to demand her ultimatum. Could Massachusetts and Connecticut be prevailed on to make a liberal cession of their claims and throw all their weight into our scale every purpose might soon be obtained. Is not the subject of sufficient importance to justify an Address to them from their Sister States? The lands are actually settling with amazing rapidity. Now is the critical juncture to urge on this business. In the course of a few years the country will be peopled like Vermont. It will be independent and the whole property of the soil will be lost forever to the United States.  A spirited memorial has lately been sent to Congress from the General Court of Massachusetts against half pay or commutation, and against the high salaries of the civil list.(12) They speak as plain a language as they formerly spoke to Great-Britain. They fear that Congress in some of their late grants of money have not sufficiently attended to the public good, the rules of justice, and the spirit of the ConfOEderation. They remind Congress that they inherit republican principles from their ancestors, and that it is necessary to attend to the voice and abilities of the people. They also complain of the old money's not being redeemed and conclude by observing that these things have so exceedingly embarrassed them that they have not been able to agree to give Congress the revenue they requested by their resolve of the 18th of last April. The policy of this address is very striking. They enumerate their greivances. They apply for redress; but they keep their purse-strings in their own hands. They do not grant the revenues nor do they promise it, even in case their present grievances should be redressed. The power of withholding assent to the yearly supply bill in the British House of Commons is the most powerful check to the strides of prerogative. The Irish Commons availed themselves of this great privilege, and by it obtained redress. Had the State of Massachusetts granted Congress the revenue they request, what would have remained in their hands to have given weight to their remonstrance against the commutation and high salaries or against any other grievance? The experience of all ages evinces that interest and power too often prevail over reason and justice in the affairs of State. Gratitude, honor and humanity may obtain among individuals in social life; in political concerns between States and Kingdoms they are ties too feeble to be relied on.   The history and fate of the Impost of Feb. 3d, 1781 are too well known to be repeated. The impost of April 18th, 1783 has not been passed on by the States; it is under their consideration. Some have partially complied and one, viz, Pennsylvania has resolved to comply, but has done no more. On the justice and policy of adopting that measure your Delegates beg leave to submit a few observations. The power of the purse is the touch-stone of freedom in all States. If the people command their own money they are free; but if their Sovereign commands it they are slaves. All other strings in government take their tone from the mode of raising money. An alteration therefore in the mode of raising money is an alteration of the Constitution. It is an essential & radical change. A change that, on experience, will be felt most sensibly. It cannot be an indifferent thing, or a matter of small moment. It is like altering the center of gravity. It is like transferring the fee simple of an estate. It is like putting your weapon of defence into another man's hand.  The 8th Article of ConfOEderation, after prescribing a rule for ascertaining the proportion of taxes to be paid by the several States, viz. according to the value of lands, buildings and improvements, provides \""That the taxes for paying that proportion shall be laid and levied by the Authority and direction of the legislatures of the several States\"". But the Impost of April 18th proposes \""to invest the United States in Congress Assembled with a power to levy for the use of the United States the following duties upon goods\"" &c.(13) A compliance herewith will therefore transfer this power to levy money from \""the legislatures of the several States\"" to the \""United States in Congress assembled.\"" The importance of this transfer cannot be too maturely considered. The Consequence of this radical change in the constitution of this country cannot be too closely attended to. Let it be also observed that the million and an half called for annually, and for which credit is to be given to the particular States is also \""to be collected by persons appointed as aforesd.\"" That is \""amenable only to Congress.\"" So that in short the States are called to give to Congress not only the sum of two millions, four hundred and fifteen thousand, nine hundred and fifty six dollars annually; but also the power of lev[y]ing and collecting the same from the citizens by such laws and by such ordinance and by such servants as to the sovereign and uncontroulable will of Congress shall seem best from time to time. For it is most clear that Congress will be cloathed with full power to make and promulgate a code of criminal law to ensure the effectual collection of the monies granted. They will have power to revise, amend, alter, enlarge, extend or abridge their laws and ordinances from time to time as occasion or the spirit of the times may require. And if a committee can report and get the report accepted that the Impost is \""within the Spirit of the ConfOEderation\"" And that \""the power to borrow money,\"" which Congress undoubtedly have, \""by implication\"" contains the power of levying it by an   Impost may not some future Committee equally ingenious discover that the power to make penal laws by implication contains the power to erect courts for the trial of offenders; and may you not thus, in the event, see continental taxes collected by continental officers, under the laws of Congress; and offenders against these laws, perhaps agreeably to the form of an ordinance already drawn up for that purpose by a committee of Congress, liable to be carried into any part of the United States for trial and that before continental judges appointed by Congress. Such in time might be the bitter fruit of this evil tree, a Continental Impost.  The State of Rhode-Island &c is called on, agreeable to its assigned proportion at the least to cloath Congress with the power to levy and collect in the aforesaid manner the sum of 52,520 dollars annually. If so much is to be raised within that little State under authority and direction of Congress; it may be asked how much in addition thereto can be levied and collected under the authority and direction of the legislature of the State? The answer to this question is very obvious. Of what consideration or weight then will our Genl. Assembly be in the Union, or even in the State, when they shall thus have divested themselves of the only power which makes them respectable? viz, that of raising money from the people. Will they not degenerate below the grade of a Mayor, Alderman and Common Council of a paltry borough? Will not therefore the General Assembly, in complying with the recommendation of the 18th of April, directly and to every intent & purpose vote their own annihilation? Such a vote is not to be expected from Freemen. The Assembly of Rhode-Island too well understand the nature of the trust committed to them by the choice and confidence of the people to abuse it by such a vote. Their power of taxing the people is delegated to them, and cannot be delegated to any foreign power, and such is Congress, in this point in view, as much as England or France. Nay the General Assembly have an equal right to give Congress to raise all the money to be raised from the people as they have to give them power to raise so much.  By the 9th article of ConfOEderation It is declared that the United States in Congress assembled shall have authority \""to borrow money or to emit bills on the credit of the United States.\"" Experience has given proof of the judgment and discretion with which emitting bills has been conducted. The multiplicity of officers daily branching out in all the departments, together with their great salaries and perquisites, the prosecution and even prodigality in the expenditure of the paper money with which the continent was deluged, convinced the world that either Congress ought not to have had the power of emitting bills, or that they ought to have made a better use of it; and that nothing but a departure from their plighted faith could save the nation from ruin.   They have also a right \""to borrow money.\"" Their domestic loan amounts to 11,463,804 dollars and their foreign loan to 7,885,085 dollars, in all 19,348,889 dollars. It is not necessary to suggest that any part of these loans either at home or abroad have been misapplied or that our European loans have not been accounted for by those who have done the public business in Europe: Indeed it ought to be mentioned that measures are taking to bring them to a strict account: the only remark to be made is that Congress have run the States in debt near 20 millions without applying to them; and may run them in debt in the same way 20 millions more if they can find use and obtain credit for the same; and nothing can check the wanton use of this power but their own moderation or a want of credit. With respect to the moderation of courts let us hear a late learned writer on the financies of G. Britain. \""Nothing, says he can check the luxury and extravagance of a court but the want of means.\""  Should the credit of Congress be established as effectually as some people wish; by putting into their hands a permanent and independent revenue, the power to levy and collect it and the power to keep up standing forces in time of peace in addition to their powers of emitting bills and borrowing money; it might then be asked, with great propriety, what could set bounds to the luxury, and extravagance, or to the pride and ambition of the Court of the United States? What could limit the number, or measure the salaries of their civil list? What could prevent the introduction of pensioners, venality and corruption? Alass! the annual election of delegates would prove an ineffectual barrier to the torrent of debauchery! Might not the shortness of enjoyment provoke intemperance in the use of the power? Are not annual tenants commonly less careful of the tenement than tenants for life?  Three years in six delegates may set in Congress. The term of many members will expire next November. May not the old proverb \""make hay while the sun shines\"" be adopted? What cabals, what juntos, what bandying into parties, what prostitution of votes may not take place in some future and corrupt Congress, to obtain places for themselves on their leaving Congress, or for their friends and dependents? In such dismal events, which gracious Heaven avert! will it not be sorely regretted by all good men that the States in the days of their infancy, credulity and folly parted with their most important power, the power of the purse and concentred in Congress those dangerous powers, which never ought to be combined in a single deliberative and sovreign body of men.  On this argument a notable distinction is raised betwixt funds and revenues. A popular writer, who, in the abundance of his zeal, undertook to convince the State of Rhode-Island of the propriety of the late impost in a course of letters on that subject, and who since has ap-  plied to Congress to reward his services, and obtained a report, that a new office or place should be created for him with a handsome annual salary.(14) This writer has the credit of first raising this curious and important distinction, that revenues when appropriated become funds and cease to be revenues. It will not be thought prudent; nor is it necessary to shake the public faith in the resolves of Congress appropriating the Impost. Whoever casts his eyes over the doings of Congress in regard to money will discover a wo[e]ful versatility. The old money was issued at par. By the resolves of Mh. 18. 1780 it was to be called in at 40 for 1. Various attempts have been made of late to obtain a vote for redeeming it at 75 for 1; but they have hitherto failed, and at what rate it will be finally redeemed is not in the power of mortals to determin. The Interest of the loan-office certificates issued before the first of March 1778 was to be paid in bills on France: their payment has been intirely stopped. The requisition of Novr. 2nd. 1781--for the current services of 1782, which was expressly appropriated, among other things, for payment of the wages due to the army for that year is to be diverted, it would seem, to another year for the army is turned over to the funded debt for their whole pay to the end of 1783.  Other instances might be produced to shew that Congress have been frequently necessitated to depart from their resolves and appropriations of money; and is it supposable that no contingency will occur to justify, in the opinion of some future Congress, a departure from the resolve of the 16th day of Decr. last? Surely much faith is requisite to enable a man with his eyes open to answer in the negative. The above observations tend also to prove the propriety and necessity of the particular States keeping their funds and revenues under their own direction, and subject only to their own particular appropriation for it is a maxim founded on great experience that no order of men in a State can be competent in all events to manage the affairs thereof in regard to collecting and appropriating its revenues unless they are also cloathed with the full powers of legislation.  For almost three years have the counsels of America and public measures been embarrassed with new-fangled schemes and projects, and during this time it has been the interest, if not the endeavour, of the abettors thereof to obstruct constitutional measures and defeat their success, in order to give force to their arguments, and to add weight to their scale. It is much to be wished that the Great Council of this nation would abandon the pursuit of new systems and measures and seriously apply themselves to the resources of this country; in that mode and in that only which is pointed out in and warranted by confOEderation. A doubt cannot be entertained but that the resources of this country are fully equal to all the just demands of the public.   The exertions of the States, their loans, their advances in specific articles, their monied payments and their personal services in the course of the late war; even before their respective governments had been established or acquired their present tone and energy leave no room to doubt that the present constitution is sufficiently organized and happily calculated to draw from the people the necessary contributions. Should a fair trial of the powers of the present Constitution of the United States be had for a few years in time of peace and should they be found ineffectual, then and not until then will it be prudent to attempt any innovations.  It should be rememberd that next March is assigned by a resolve of Congress of the seventeenth day of February for apportioning to the several States their quotas of the public charges from the beginning until the year 1789 agreeably to the 8th article of confOEderation.(15) This ought to be considered as an object of great importance; and your delegates confide that the State they represent will send forward in due time the data required by said resolve, on which a constitutional apportionment of the public expences may be grounded.  By a resolve of Congress of the 18th of April last a proposition has gone forth to the States to alter the 8th article of confOEderation.(16) It is proposed to alter the rule for apportioning the public expence from that of \""the value of all lands, buildings and improvements therein\"" to that of \""the whole number of white and other free citizens and inhabitants of every age, sex and condition including those bound to servitude for a term of years, and three fifths of all other persons not comprehended in the foregoing discription except Indians not paying taxes in each State.\"" On this proposition it may be observed that altho' it may be nearly true that the riches of a country generally keeps pace with its population yet a distinction ought to be taken in the instance in question; for from local circumstances and particular occupations, and ways of living in the several States, of which the American union consists, this proposition may not be true when applied individually to them. A certain portion of soil is necessary to every farmer. It is found to be injurious to the interest of agriculture to have land cut into too small as well as too large portions in the hands of individuals; wherefore in process of time as the people increase they resort to places convenient for trade and manufactures, leaving the lands to be cultivated by a competent number. Hence the people in commercial and manufacturing towns become very numerous. Should this observation be applied to the State of Rhode-Island &c, compared with the other States in the fOEderal union will not a presumption arise that the proposed alteration in the fifth Article of ConfOEderation would work an injury to that State? It may also be observed that the personal estate and effects are not to be taken into the estimate agreeably to the present rule any further than they give additional value to   the lands &c in the respective States; for which reason the proposed alteration of the rule to numbers would make it bear harder on commercial and manufacturing States.  However various the sentiments of people may be about the propriety of the above observation it will be readily allowed on all hands that the present State of the comparative numbers and wealth of Rhode-Island, Massachusetts, Connecticut, not to mention any other States, strongly favour them.  Their present numbers would afford a ratio of taxation for Rhode-Island to Massachusetts as 1 to 7, for Rhode-Island to Connecticut as 1 to 4 nearly: An inequality too obvious to find any advocates one would imagin even in those States. It is not to be doubted but that the rule in ConfOEderation would at present be more in favour of the State of Rhode-Island as well as more just and equitable: And whether the same causes which affect the comparative number and wealth of the different States will not in future have a proportional operation must be left to eventful time to disclose.  Besides if numbers are to be the rule ought not all the blacks in the Southern States to be taken into the census? The nett produce of the labour of a black in those States is, at least, double to that of a common white labourer in the eastern States. Further and which merits serious attention, innovations in established constitutions ought to be cautiously guarded against. One alteration in the ConfOEderation may be a precedent for and produce a second, these a third and so on until that system founded in the republican principles of the Eastern States shall be utterly annihilated.  It is under consideration and will probably be carried, that the Loan-office certificates shall be liquidated agreeably to the Scale of Congress; and that the keepers of the Loan-offices be directed to issue certificates for one years interest due on said certificates and on all other liquidated debts, to be receivable in payment of the requisition of 4th Sept. 1782.(17) By a provision in that requisition the demands in the States respectively for interest are first to be paid and the surplusage only sent to the fOEderal Treasury; your delegates will not lose sight of this beneficial provision until they obtain the regulations necessary to facilitate its operation.  The settlement of the public accounts meets with various obstructions; partly owing, it is said, to the difficulty of obtaining suitable persons to act as Commissioners, partly to the confusion with which much of the public business has been transacted, and partly from the difficulty of fixing particular and certain rules for the conduct of the Commissioners.  It is hoped that the importance of the subjects on which we have treated in this letter will apologize for its length, and that the candour of   the General Assembly will impute the freedom with which their delegates have disclosed their minds to their zeal in the service of the State. We are with the highest sentiments of respect for your Excellency, and the State which we have the honor to represent in Congress, Your Excellency's most obedt.

  Sir Princeton Septr. 8th. 1783  This Post brought us no Letter from your Excellency, & little has occurred with us since our last communications, worthy your attention. A recent letter recd. by the Secretary of War from Genl. Irvine, commanding at Fort Pitt informs that a body of abt 400 Men, from the Western Frontier of Virginia, had passed the Ohio, in order to establish a settlement on the Muskingum. The General apprehends, SEPTEMBER 8, 1783  that an immediate Indian War, will be among the first of the many evil consequences that must result from such lawless measures.(1) Intelligence received by a missionary, lately sent in order to com- municate the substance of the Articles of pacification to the Indian nations, gives great weight to the surmises of General Irvine. This Person was well received by Brigr. Genl. McClene, the british officer commdg. at Detroit, (altho prevented from holding a council with the Indians,) Who communicated to him the purport of intelligence which he had recd. by an Indian runner from our Western Country, & which he had transmitted to General Haldimand. The substance of this was that the Virginians had passed the Ohio, & had committed many wanton & unprovoked acts of cruelty that had in some measure produced retaliation.(2)  Baron Steuben is just arriv'd here from Canada whither he had been sent, in order to make arrangements with General Haldimand, for the reception of the Posts ceded on our north western Frontier.(3) The purposes of his mission have been totally frustrated, as that Officer, (who met him at Sorrel) alledged he had recd. no orders from his Court except to cease hostilities--And that he considered the late pacification so far conditional untill a definitive Treaty that he did not think himself authorized to permit the Baron even to visit the Posts--which (it seems) cannot now (were orders recd. for that purpose) be evacuated untill the ensuing Season.(4)  The evacuation of New York advances rapidly notwithstanding, the number of those inhabitants whose fears have of late determined them, to accompany the Garrison. Their apprehensions exaggerated by doubt on one hand by the policy of the enemy & on the other by the publications which have of late appeared in the American Papers, will probably terminate in the sudden establishment of a very rich & powerful neighbour to the United States & certainly a very inimical one. A Committee was appointed by the Legislature of Virginia at a former session, to state her claim to the Western territory. This business we believe now rests with Mr. Randolph & we wish to be informed of the progress which that Gentleman has made in it.(5) We have the honor to be with great respect & esteem, Yr. Excellency's Most obedient & very humble Servants, John F Mercer Theok. Bland Jr. A. Lee  ""

  Dear Sir, Princeton Sept. [9?] 1783.(1) No Letters have been received from abroad since my last to Gov. Bowen(2) excepting a Letter laid before Congress by Genl. Washington from Chev. Jean de Heintz, Secry of the Order of Divine Providence in Poland. This appears to be an order of dignity in Europe; tho of modern Institution. It consists of three Classes. 1st Chevaliers grand croix. 2d Chevaliers Commandeurs. 3d Chevaliers petit croix. The expences of Initiation are for the first 110 Ducats: for the second 55 Ducats: for the 3d 30 Ducats. \""The knights of this order, says the Letter, sensibly touched with the visible & efficacious interposition of Divine Providence in protecting the 13 States of North America & in giving them the force necessary to resist tyranny & to establish Liberty, the rights of man & of nature\"" have thought proper to address themselves to the Hero of the age--praying him to lay before Congress the following proposal. That Congress should name 12 of the most worthy for each of the three classes of the order--in all 36, To be created, Knights of the order of Divine Providence.(3)  Congress have not acted upon this matter yet. On perusing the Confederation, you will judge for yourself how far a compliance, even so far as to nominate, or recommend persons to this knighthood would be an infraction thereof.  By direction of Congress Gen. Washington is now in attendance at this place. An House is taken for him at Rocky Hill about 41/2 miles off. He has had an Audience with Congress, for the particular Etiquette whereof I must refer you to my last Letter to my worthy friend Dr. Arnold.(4) The public papers will give you our address & his reply. He was sent for to be consulted on the arrangements necessary for a time of peace. Some hints on which policy you will also observe in Dr. Arnolds Letter aforsd. In consequence of a polite card from his Excellency the General to his Excellency the President--The latter, with all the present members, Chaplains & great officers of Congress had the Honor of dining at the Generals Table last Friday. The Tables were spread under a Marquis, or tent taken from the British. The repast was elegant--but the Generals Company crowned the whole. As I had the fortune to be seated facing the General; I had the pleasure of hearing all his Conversation. The President of Congress was seated on his right & the minister of France on his left. I observed with much pleasure that the Generals front was uncommonly open & pleasant--the contracted, pensive Air betokening deep thought & much care, which I noticed on Prospect Hill in 1775 is done away: & a pleasant smile sparkling vivacity of wit & humour succeeds. It will please you to hear the following which occur out of SEPTEMBER 9, 1783  many. On the president observing that in the present Situation of our affairs he believed that Mr. Morris had his hands full, The General replied at the same Instant--\""He wished he had his Pockets full too.\"" On Mr. Peters (from Pennsylvania) observing that the man who made those cups (for we drank wine out of silver cups) was turned a Quaker preacher--The General replied that \""He wished he had been a Quaker preacher before he had made the cups.\"" You must also have the French Ministers remark on the Generals Humour--\""You 'tink de penitence wou'd have been good for de cups.\""  Congress have ordered an Equestrian Statue of General Washington to be erected at the place where they may establish their permanent residence. No honor short of those, which the Deity vindicates to himself, can be too great for Gen. Washington.  Little business has been done since my arrival here owing to an incomplete representation. It is not expected that much will be done before a new Congress shall meet in November next. Congress will, I believe spend the winter here, or at Annapolis. I think they have bid a final farewell to Philadelphia. Tho' no art, or exertion will be left untried by Philadelphia to draw us back.  I have been hammering, out doors, on the Subject of the Western territory--hope in a few days a step will be taken by proclamation,(5) &c. as hinted in my last Letter to Gov. Bowen. Quere--Should Congress agree to establish their residence for 15 years at or near Fort Pitt, would it not raise our back lands so high as to buy up nearly all our domestic Securities? The back Country is settling with amazing rapidity. It is told me by a person of information that Mr M.(6) is at the head of the two great Companies of land-jobbers, Viz. the Indiana, & Vandalia. You may remember some strokes in certain letters written to the State--as well as that in Mr. P.(7) I have transmitted to Mr. Thomson all the information I have been able to obtain about the mode in which the public accounts are to be settled; as well as on the Subject of what will be proper charges. A Committee have the Subject under consideration. Their report shall be sent in due time. I fear sufficient attention is not paid to the Settlement of accounts & other practicable means of giving ease & satisfaction to the Creditors of the public. A curt reply on this head with some Gentlemen is--It is of more importance to obtain funds to pay them when settled. Everything is calculated to alarm the public creditors, & to enlist them in favour of the late revenue recommendations.  The Subject of the old money was resumed last Friday, after debating it a whole day nothing was done. It will be resumed tomorrow.(8) The enclosed account will inform you how much has been paid by each State--and how much they are respectively deficient.(9) The Delegates from Massachusetts (who, by the by, are good men & honest republicans & with us in all measures) assure us that there are in that State   now no less than about 47 millions of old money; & you will see that they have paid in their Quota.  I cannot pretend to foretell what will be done; but I have not the disposition of many on this head. You will see that the Southern States have been delinquent; & I fear are too much disposed to punish us for doing our duty. How much, think you, have we of the old emissions?  With the most perfect Consideration, I am, dear Sir, your Friend, & hble Servt. David Howell  P.S. I hope Cozen Jimmy will write me whether he will be a Knight of 110--55--or 30 Ducats?  ""

The smallest apology is considerd by me sufficient for your not honoring me with an address sooner, when I take into consideration the delicate & kind reason you are pleasd to assign for the same; and possibly some of my other friends at Masstts. were actuated from similar motives, in not giving me the earliest notice of the change that had taken place in the delegation, but it was forwarded from the city of N.Y. very soon, & came to hand sometime before any accts. of it were received from Boston.  I should write to you, my sentiments upon the commutation, had I not lately done it to several of the Honble Council, which I have no doubt you are acquainted with;(1) you may suppose the disapprobation of our constituents is not a matter of indifference with me, but what adds to it, is, that it respects a matter that I had taken such particular pains to serve them in, & fully expecting their aprobation in the exchange of half pay for the comutation for many reasons that might be mentioned not only to the states in genl. but to Masstts. in particular which makes the disappointment the greater. The definitive treaty is not yet come to hand and it is said here that it was not signed about seven weeks since; I have done expecting it, for the present, as our Ministers have done writing about it, for in their last letters they do not so much as mention it.  Your approbation of the conduct of Congress in removing from Phila. confirms me more in the opinion that they were right but great SEPTEMBER 11, 1783  pains have been, & are taking to get us to return, & tomorrow we are to determine upon the place of our temporary residence 'till Congress shall fix upon the place of her permanent abode.  The remonstrance from Masstts. has been largely considered in Congress, and we insist upon the Salaries to the civil Officers being lowered, as the grants were made when the charges of living & necessaries of life were much higher than they now are, & I believe we shall succeed in this business: And we are also endeavoring to make the commutation more agreeable to Masstts. if possible, but whether we shall suceed in this I consider as very uncertain, but my colleagues as well as myself are desirous of doing all in their power to satisfy the good people of Masstts.(2)  I have endeavored to comply with your wishes respecting the three letters, you are pleas'd to mention,(3) but can't find any person here that can give me any information respecting them, but I shall continue my endeavors as it always gives me pleasure to render you services.

  Dear sir. Princeton, 11th. Sepr. 1783.  I have receiv'd your obliging favor of the 18th ultimo. & you will please to accept my thanks for the same.  No doubt you have taken notice in the newspapers, that General Washington is attending Congress, or lives near them for the present; having the honor to be chairman of the committee to confer with him upon the peace arrangement,(1) I find he has much at heart, the laying out & settling the back country, as the people are in large numbers, pushing out into the country, & settleing upon the lands, without any title; he mentioned to me, a few days since, in conversation, that it was his opinion, that in five years from this time, there would be a severe war in that part of the country, unless great attention was paid by Government to the settlement of the same; but Congress have great embarrassments in this business, as well as every thing else of importance, that comes under their consideration; a question arises, whether there is any land within the boundaries of the U.S. that is not the property of some one State; some of the large states seem to be willing to make cessions to the union, but the small states are not will- SEPTEMBER 11, 1783  ing to accept them, but insist upon each state having its boundaries fixed & determined, and then have the remainder divided amoung the states, or considered as the property of the U.S. & disposed of accordingly. An other difficulty we have to encounter, is, what troops shall be kept up in time of peace, & whether they are to be raised & kept up under the immediate direction of Congress, or whither they are to be state troops kept up by the state that raise them for their defence, by the permission of Congress; you will naturally say, it must be done agreeably to the confederation, that is the very difficulty, for could we construe our constitution alike we should not have so much trouble in doing the public business.  I have been in hopes for some months past that the definitive treaty wou'd come to hand & be finished before I left Congress, & a number of other very important matters, that are now before Congress wou'd be determined upon, but such are the embarrassments, of one kind & another, it is altogether uncertain, as to the time, when business will be finished in Congress; however, I shall continue my attention (while I tarry) to the important business, that so much respects my constituents, namely, old money, commutation, &c. &c. yet I have but little expectation, that any thing will be done upon these affairs at present, & it is not my wish that the Honorable Court should tax my constituents, by imposts, or any other way for the use of Congress, 'till they will decide upon several important matters that are before them, which so much respects the State of Massachusetts, & I believe Congress have but little expectation, that much more money may be expected from our State, before something is done upon these matters, surely they do not, if they think we speak the sense of our constituents, which I believe we do.

  Gentlemen, Prince Town 11th Septr. 1783.  We perceive by a Letter to Congress of the 11th of July last,(1) from the honorable Legislature of the CommonWealth, that it was their Intention, at their next Session, to consider the Expediency of granting an Impost, & to determine on other important Matters, relative to the fOEderal Union: And in aid of their Decisions, We think it our Duty to transmit the best Information that can be had of the Disposition of Congress, respecting the old Emissions, the Reduction of the civil List Establishment, & the half pay or Commutation.  The proceedings of Congress of the 7th of January last, on a Report for sinking those Emissions were contain'd in a Letter of the 11th of February last from the Delegates to the General Court,(2) & will also appear by the printed Journals transmitted to the Governor & Council: And having again lately agitated the Matter,(3) We have not been able after a long Debate, to obtain a decided Vote, neither have We the prospect of effecting, what We conceive to be an equitable Issue.  Many States appear indisposed to take any Measures on the Subject --some propose to fix the Depretiation at 500 for l--and others to average the Rate, at which the Money passed in the several States, previ- SEPTEMBER 11, 1783  ous to the Stoppage of the Circulation: And in this Diversity of Sentiment, is the Matter at present suspended.  We think, that agreable to the plighted Faith of Congress, the old Emissions should be called in at 40 for 1 & funded Certificates dated May 1781, when the Circulation ceased, should be issued in Payment--or to do equal Justice to the Holders, that the Money should be sunk by a Tax on the deficient States, for their respective quotas of the extant Bills; or for the Amount thereof in Specie at 75 for 1: and the Specie be applied to the Redemption of those Bills, with Interest from the Date abovementioned.  The principal Arguments in Support of not taking any Measures on the Subject, or of fixing the Depretiation at 500 for 1 were these--That the Inhabitants of the delinquent States had been Holders of considerable Sums of the old Emissions, but had parted with them about the Time of their ceasing to circulate, at a Depretiation of 500 to 1200 for 1--that Speculators from other States had purchased the Money--that if deficient States were required to sink their quotas at 40 or even at 75 for 1, great Injustice would be done to their Citizens, who would never submit to such a Tax; that if Speculators from other States had gained an advantage over those of Massachusetts, the latter must sustain the Loss--& that, if the Inhabitants of a State have by any Means engrossed more than their quotas of that Money, they must submit to the Consesequences. The proposition for ascertaining the Value, by averaging the current Rate of the Emissions about the Time of their ceasing to circulate, was supported on the principle, that previous to the War, when any Legislature had issued Bills & they depretiated, the current Value was usually ascertained, & a Tax levied for sinking them according to that Value; & that the Measure appearing just, was always acquiesced in by the Inhabitants.  In answer to these Arguments, & in support of our own propositions, We have, amongst other Considerations, urged--that in March, 1780, Congress finding that their Bills of Credit had depretiated rapidly, ascertained their Value for the express purpose of sinking them, & apportioned the Amount thereof on the Several States--that this apportionment, was thus far a Division of the national Debt, with a proviso that the quotas should be revised & finally adjusted by the Confederation--that the State of Massachusetts complied with the Requisition for sinking those Emissions, in full Confidence, that other States would have done the same--that every State was in Justice bound to tax for its quota, & had this been done, the Depretiation would not have encreased much above 40, & by no Means above 75 for 1--that therefore the Inhabitants of the delinquent States should sustain the Losses arising from their Delinquency; that at the Rate of 75 for 1 the Money was current in Massachusetts a Day or two before it  stopped, & large quantities were received by the Inhabitants of that State, (without notice of its Depretiation) from the Inhabitants of other States--that previous to that Time the Money could not be refused, at its fixed Value, because agreable to the Recommendations of Congress, it was a legal Tender--that previous to the War when the Depretiation was fixed, & Bills called in, the Legislatures never varied from that Depretiation, to favour Towns or Counties that neglecting to levy the Tax, had produced a greater Depretiation--that if the Inhabitants of any State were by Surprize induced to part with their Bills of Credit below the established Value, at which the Bills were called in, their Want of confidence in Government could never with propriety operate, to diminish the Value of the Money in the Hands of those who retained that Confidence--that when Congress fixed the Depretiation at 40 for 1 Justice to the publick required the Measure, because the Bills were at that Rate on an average issued by the publick; but after March 1780, a few only of the old Bills being reissued by Congress, & at a Depretiation not greater than 75 for 1, no Loss accrued to the publick by the extra Depretiation--that if the whole public Debt was in funded Securities, & by a Valuation apportioned on the several States, as well might Congress require a State, which had collected its full proportion of those securities, to levy a new Tax on the Inhabitants for Securities in their Hands, being the quotas of other States, as refuse in the present case to call on the delinquent States to redeem their quotas of the old Emissions. These are some of the principal Arguments on both sides, but it would require too much time to arrange them, or recapitulate the whole that has been advanced on the Subject.  With Respect to the Remonstrance of the Legislature, upon the Establishment of the civil List, & half pay or Commutation, a Report has been made & debated, but being no ways adequate to the purpose, another has been brot in for the Reduction of some Salaries,(4) whereby a Door will be opened for the Reduction of such others as are excessive. The last Report also proposes a plan for enabling Massachusetts, and other States in similar Circumstances to adopt Measures for effecting a Compromise with their officers, but We have no great Expectation from present appearances that anything [Satis]factory will be done on either Head.  We have stated to Congress our apprehensions, that it is the Intention of the Delegates from some of the States to postpone a Decision on these important Subjects, in order to obtain a previous Grant of the Impost from the State of Massachusetts, & a Collection of other Taxes, & then to give a Negative to the whole; and We have also given it as our opinion to Congress that no Impost will be granted by our Constituents neither will they continue to supply the publick Treasury, unless their Grievances are redressed. We have been thus explicit   from considering that whenever a Disposition appears in Congress to delay or withhold Justice from the States, that Disposition must be checked, or it may tend to a Dissolution of the Union; & as the publick Supplies are furnished by the States, [each State has a con]stitutional Check,(5) [by withholding grants,] untill Justice is [obtained by a redress] of Grievances.  [We shall continue] our Exertions by firm but moderate Measures, to promote the Veiws of the honorable Legislature in the premisses, & rely on their aid in Support of those Measures.

  [September 11? 1783] The North-American.(1) No. I. The British Empire in America (prior to the late revolution) in the progress of population, and rapid encrease of wealth and power, had no paralel in the annals of mankind. These are proofs of the influence of mild and gentle forms of government, and of an happy state of civil society, which must enforce conviction in every candid and enlightened mind, and which however of late discoloured by British insolence and barbarity, and veiled by necessary prejudices, may in the present stage of the contest, meet with the unreserved acknowledgements of the most strenuous assertors of American independence. The principles too of political liberty, deeply rooted in the first establishments of the colonies, had flourished with such unrestrained luxuriance, that SEPTEMBER 11, 1783  Portrait of John Francis Mercer  the anticipation of distant tyranny gave birth to opposition more firm and unanimous, than the iron rod of despotism weilded with unrelenting fury, had ever roused mankind to, in other climes. The independence of the Thirteen States, has added dignity to our government, but if for this our peace and social happiness are to be exchanged; the splendor of sovereignty will only rescue from obscurity the wretchedness of our citizens, and transmit a melancholy lesson, to future age, never to desert solid systems which have yielded freedom and tranquility, to pursue the dreams and phantoms of theory and speculation.  It is indulgence to the present civil institutions of America, when we only say, that they are cursed with the impotence of old age, when they should enjoy the vigor of youth.  If the authors of the revolution, who now survive, view peace with Britain, as the completion of their object, and sink into supiness, whilst the horrors of anarchy and domestic confusion succeed a dissolution of the strict bonds of the former government, the bitter execrations of their fellow citizens, who see violence and discord purchased at the expence of their blood and treasure, will be their first reward, and that posterity, on whom they have entailed misery, when happiness was their birth-right, will perpetuate the infamy of their names.  It becomes them then, boldly to stand forth, and by one generous effort to accomplish the work they have begun. Let them by a government adequate to the ends of society, secure those blessings to which the virtues, sacrifices and sufferings of America have an undeniable claim. Let them do this--and then, when corroding time, shall separate pure and immortal virtues from attendant frailties, which at first obscure their lustre--when envy and jealousy shall be no more--a just and grateful fame will rank them amidst those idolized patriots of Greece and Rome, whose names antiquity has already consecrated at her venerable shrine. The eye of posterity will hang with a fervid glow of admiration over the historic page, which paints the patriots of this infant world. A world where reason early diffused her illuminated empire, and reflection became the parent of virtues, which in the savage and remote ages of Europe were the offspring of violence, or the ebullition of ungovernable passion.  Our governments were framed in the moment of turbulence and war--hasty productions on the spur of exigency, they can only be considered as the necessary but temporary instruments, to work out the revolution. Their most enlightened framers viewed them at their formation, but as the foundations of permanent systems, to be reared in peace and tranquility. Six years experience has now unfolded their imperfections and defects, and the acknowledgement of our independence has developed prospects, which (pending the contest) were obscured by the clouded uncertainty of the event.   This then is the auspicious moment! At an æra so awful and so critical, it is the design of this address deliberately to investigate and to expose with freedom, the real situation of these states, and in anticipating evil and misfortune, to suggest their remedy. In pursuing these objects the reasonable hopes of their preserving internal tranquility, will be the first, as it is the most important enquiry.  And here let it be observed--that the same active and predominant passion of the human breast, which prompts mankind to arrogate superiority and to the acquirement of riches, honor and power, which restricted to the selfish purposes of an individual, we term ambition, is when extended to the disinterested object of aggrandizing a community, what we dignify with the appelation of patriotism--that the exertion of this principle being as advantageous to a republic, as it is useful to a man, whoever will make the interest of his country his own, and shew a blind devotion to its views and prejudices, will find the road open to its dignities and employments, and will be honoured with the flattering distinction of patriot--and that the competition of interests and the desire of rulers to exalt their respective communities have laid the foundation of those wars which have desolated the world, and entailed misery on the human race.  Unhappily then for America, the separate sovereignties of our respective States, have left these principles to act with a force, but feebly restrained by the weak barrier of a nominal union. An undeviating adherence to state interests, state prejudices, state-aggrandizement, (or to comprehend the evil in a term to state politics) is the sad prognostic of that discord, confusion and never ceasing war, which has been the invariable lot of separate Sovereignties and neighbouring States. A cause every way adequate to such pernicious effects aggravated by old and new disputes between the different States, and inflammatory reflections reciprocally cast, will not fail of receiving additional weight from a number of unhappy circumstances; each sufficient to disorder, even the best connected and organized system.  'Ere the war had yet terminated, the States betrayed the baleful effects of divided councils, and want of mutual confidence. Requisitions for men and money for general purposes, if not contemptuously neglected, were most commonly answered by heated assertions of the prior, undue and superior exertions of each State respectively. This illusion originating in their partial view of Continental Affairs, was supported by their unliquidated Accounts, and every attempt on the part of the general Council to dissipate the one or settle the other, have by the prejudices of ignorance or insinuations of design in the one case, or the neglect or inability of the States in the other, invariably proved abortive.  Individuals in the commercial States, attached to the American cause, had received the currency of the union, in discharge of their  private Debts, and became in most instances gradually possessed of it to the full amount of their fortunes, which generally consist in money. They obeyed the public call, and with implicit confidence entrusted those rulers whose fidelity they relied on, with the hopes and support of themselves and families: Hence it is that those States find their citizens at the close of the war, in advance on Continental loans, in a degree that exceeds all measure of proportion; during its continuance, this class of creditors have suffered with patience and with fortitude, the total deprivation of the use of their fortunes, whilst the pressing exigencies of the times, seemed to apologize for withholding their right; but peace terminating that excuse, when the general plan for Continental engagements, lately proposed by that body, who were authorized; nay compelled to make them, (whose honor, with that of the nation, is to be supported by its success, or sacrificed by its failure,) proves abortive, and the regular and proper source of payment remains obstructed. Those States to which they pay allegiance, and which are bound to protect them, cannot refuse--either to pay them, and thereby burthen themselves with an unjust and unequal load, or interpose their powers and force, to extort them justice whence it is due.  On some parts of the continent the war has pressed sorely and partially--her bloody scourge has desolated the state of New York each successive year, and what has escaped the depredations of the enemy, has been wrested from her citizens by a rigorous military impress. To whom shall they apply for payment? Shall their own state pay them? Would not unfeeling injustice herself blush to load New York, just emerging from such complicated distress, with an unequal share of the general debt.  I fear it has already become unpopular to mention that there was an American army, during the late war--that they have claims on the gratitude of their fellow-citizens, and the justice of the continent, which are equally unpaid. Unpleasing as the theme may be--Yet once more, oh ye Americans! ye shall listen to their tale--to shield and protect you and yours, their youths have passed away in rigorous campaigns, amidst hunger and amidst nakedness, exposed to bleak colds of the north, without tents and without cloaths--the eye of him whose hand now writes these lines, has often traced their route, on the cold snow, with the blood of their bare feet, thence unsheltered have they marched thro' the burning sands of Carolina and each state thro'out this long extended continent has been stained with their best blood. They have gone home unpaid, many of them to contemplate the sad remnants, the ruined relicts of once splendid fortunes. Shall it be to wear away their old age in poverty, until they find in the all healing grave, the only cure for wounds which ingratitude inflicts on the feeling mind? shall it be to rot? to perish in your jails? Or shall the different states pay their respective lines all their demands? Some of them  SEPTEMBER 11,1783  have acted generously, they have acted nobly, and of them there can be no apprehensions. But are there not grounds to fear, that a very principal demand will never be paid by the northern states if referred to them? Admitting that those states who have failed in the heat and burthen of the day, are now to escape their proportion by this unequal and unfair distribution, and to be rewarded for their remissness and delinquencies. Still to whom shall that part of the continental army apply, whom no state will now acknowledge. They are a body of men not contemptible for their number or services, should they become so for their poverty or their wretchedness.  Here let it be remembered that there are many of the states, who have no back lands, no western wilds, where they may seclude in solitude their war-worn veterans, from the fastidious eye of wealth and luxury. These things should be considered in due time, and we should recollect, that those who have been reared by the iron hand of ruthless war, have in no age or clime, been marked for a tame passion of evil and injustice.  It is a maxim that has stood the test of time, and is now sanctified by experience--that government should be founded in justice and good faith--and that the institution which shall be proven incapable of dispensing the one and preserving the other, cannot be long respected, and will never be supported. Let the government of the United States submit to this ignominy, and be exposed to this danger, and the contracts which they have formed, depend for their execution on others, and that faith which they have plighted be interpreted, broken or preserved, according to the caprice, avarice or resentment of the ignorant, interested or designing. Let it be admitted that each state shall in all cases pay its own citizens of all classes, and let us view the probable consequence which will result from the measure independent of those which must flow from the total departure from and violation of a confOEderation, which seems to have been created only to be the derision of the people, and the embarrassment of those whom they depute to rule. What now excites clamour would then produce commotion, the unavailing complaints of individuals, rend the hearts of the honest man, the man of feeling and sentiment--but they touch not the callous multitude, who are secured from the effects of their resentment, by their imbecillity. But when a state, by paying its citizens becomes possessed of their claims, the style will be instantly changed. It will be then do us justice, or we will pay ourselves. The language of Massachusetts, when she became possessed of an over-proportion of the paper currency, was but a feeble throb of a pulse, which would then beat with a convulsive strength. The northern and middle states, among whom most of the paper money, and other continental securities now rest, might be tempted by their naval superiority to pay themselves out of the rich commerce of the Southern States, who would   necessarily seek the protection of foreign nations. What a prospect does this idea present for America?  Now let us turn our eyes to the ample western territory, which Britain has acknowledged by the late treaty, to be within our limits, and we shall find it one of the most fertile sources of endless discord and war between the different States. Will those States, who by their chartered boundaries are excluded from a participation of them, ever consent, by the laborious industry and toil of their citizens, to dig out of the earth their proportion of the expences of the war and general debt? When the States, who claim this country as within their chartered limits, may be the meer act of selling lands almost boundless, not only wipe out their proportion of the general debt, but in addition accumulate an immense public property? Will they not with an united voice, and the voice of truth alledge, that these lands were wrested from the Crown of England, for whose emolument, and not for the benefit of any class of citizens of these United States would they have been sold, but for that revolution which has been effected by their joint expence of blood & treasure. On the other hand the States, who claim under their charters, most considerable in number, and incomparably so in power, will most probably contend for and defend rights, which they asserted as early as the Confederation was proposed, and which seem to be established by the unanimous concurrence of the States in that act of union.  This train of reasoning leads to a question, which strikes home to the feelings, and will be decisive on the most essential interests of the different States. It must now soon receive a most serious agitation, whether one State will submit to be taxed at the arbitrary will of another, which will be itself exonerated in proportion to the burthen it imposes on its neighbour; for this is the direct operation of imposts on trade, laid for the separate emolument of the respective States. It is a truth which has become familiar to minds, even the most uninformed, that the consumer ultimately pays the tax on importation. The inhabitants then of those States, who are not favoured with the natural advantages of commodious harbours, must pay to their neighbours in the commercial States, whatever tax, they in their mercy and discretion may choose to load them with; and forced to make use of their ports, they may with equal injustice be compelled to pay a tax (from which they are to derive no benefit,) on every ounce of produce their industry may raise for exportation. A revolution then effected by joint efforts, has destroyed the general government, under which taxes were collected for common benefit, and substituted in its place separate Sovereignties, which are to exalt one part of the Empire, to the utter depression and impoverishment of the other.  The refinements of sophistry cannot suggest a distinction between that principle which requires a division of unappropriated western   lands between the States, and that which directs a fair and equal participation of the blessings of our unbounded commerce among those, who sitting out originally on the same ground, have made equal exertions in the common cause, and now demand an equal reward; and yet so envelloped in the mist of state prejudices has Rhode Island been, that whilst she contended with an heated anxiety for the one, with a determined perseverance she opposed the other.  Let any rational man with this view ask, what reasonable hopes we can have of voluntarily discharging our foreign debt; that is a debt which can never be divided among the different States. First, the terms on which it has been contracted, expressly stipulate against any such apportionment, and secondly the confederal rule for affixing the quota of each State has never been applied--is despaired of as impracticable, and there remains but little prospect of the defect being remedied; under these circumstances, in vain (I fear) will national honor plead the cause of honesty and justice.  Indeed it has already become a fashionable mark of independance of sentiment to depreciate the merit of France to whom the greatest portion of our foreign debt is due. Ingratitude and injustice have ever went hand in hand! Let vain specularists, in the sequestered recess of study and retirement, invent frigid maxims of policy, and lay it down as an invariable rule, that States are actuated by self-interest alone. Let them treat with ridicule all acknowledgement of national favors; still those who are conversant with human nature and public affairs, will despise the fallacious doctrine and illiberal tenet. They well know that men, whether at the head of governments or in private stations, still are men, subjected too, to the domination, and acting under the influence of human passions and prejudices; and that in Monarchies more especially, the measures of State receive their tone from the virtues or vices of the Prince. Impressed with this unalterable truth, all true Whigs--friends to the freedom, independance, and honor of America, will for ever feel a glow of gratitude to that Monarch and that nation, who first espoused our hopeless cause with an enthusiastic fervor, and then with persevering assistance and magnanimous exertion protected our infant fortunes. They will feel the blush of indignant shame if France, or even Holland, should be compelled to have recourse to our commerce (as their last resource) for repayment: A measure ever in their power--which must be the result of disappointment in a regular and pacific mode--and which (if ever adopted) will record our infamy as well as our impotence.  Reprinted from the Pennsylvania Journal, September 17, 1783.  1 The identity of \""The North American\"" has long been a matter of speculation, but research on this point assumed a new direction with the discovery of Jacob Read's September 11 letter to Thomas Bradford, the publisher of the Pennsylvania Journal, en- SEPEMBER 11, 1783  closing \""the first of an intended Series of Letters on Subjects of great National importance.\"" See the following entry. We believe that the present essay, published by Bradford on September 17, was that enclosure, and that the second installment of the \""intended series\"" was printed in the October 8 issue of the Journal under the caption \""The North American. No. II.\"" We further contend that Read served as intermediary for his close political confidant, Virginia delegate John Francis Mercer, who actually wrote the essays. From their tone and content is is clear that the two essays were composed by a young, southern congressman who was thoroughly familiar with James Madison's \""Address to the States\"" adopted in April, the congressional debates on fiscal policy that took place during the summer of 1783, Lord Sheffield's Observations on the Commerce of the American States with Europe and the West Indies that had arrived in August, and the content of several dispatches from the commissioners in Europe that were read in Congress in mid-September. See James Madison to Edmund Randolph, August 30, note 1, and September 13, 1783. The views of \""The North American\"" are striking and often strident: he (1) loathed the pernicious effects of unchecked state sovereignty; (2) sympathized with the plight of the unpaid Continental Army; (3) appreciated the vulnerability of the non-commercial states--especially the South--within the Confederation; (4) favored the creation of a national domain; (5) argued for the equitable distribution of the national debt; (6) demonstrated a real appreciation of French contributions to the war effort and continued wariness about British intentions; (7) acknowledged the obvious weakness of the United States vis-a-vis the commercial powers of Europe; (8) exhibited a profound sense of Continental obligations and responsibilities; and (9) implied that the Confederation government could not survive without coercive authority. Only a handful of delegates embracing these positions could be considered candidates for the essays' authorship. Read's strong centralist stance, maintained throughout his career, made him an obvious choice, but a close comparison of his writing style with that of \""The North American\""--the use of common function and content words, sentence length, and other common indicators--revealed too many significant variations. An analysis of the correspondence of the remaining young, southern delegates attending Congress at this time--Richard Beresford (age 28), Benjamin Hawkins (29), James McHenry (29), James Madison (32), and John Francis Mercer (24)--pointed to Mercer as the essayist.  Flamboyant, erratic, and headstrong, the impressionable young Virginia delegate had taken his seat in Congress in early February and quickly established himself as a strong advocate of states' rights who opposed centralist schemes, such as the impost, to fund the national debt. Fellow delegates testified to his vociferous and intemperate partisanship over issues before Congress which created powerful enemies who blocked important committee assignments and relegated Mercer to a marginal role. Notwithstanding, Mercer was greatly affected by events and problems that confronted Congress through the spring and summer of 1783--the arrival of the preliminary articles of peace, the \""Newburgh Conspiracy,\"" the debate over commutation of half pay, the need to maintain U.S. credit at home and abroad, attempts to disband the army while Great Britain occupied the western posts, consideration of the peace establishment, and especially the mutiny of the Pennsylvania Line and the exile of Congress to Princeton--all of which led him to adopt positions to which he had been diametrically opposed when he entered Congress.  By September Mercer felt that Congress and the nation faced a major crisis that required a direct appeal to the public. The refusal of the Massachusetts legislature to support commutation apparently served as the occasion for this first essay and Mercer incorporated thought and language from \""North-American No. I\"" directly into a September 19 committee report that he co-authored, for which see JCC, 24:483n.2, 25:582-85, 584n.1, 609-13; and PCC, item 20, 1:149-59. \""There is a great deal of good sense among the People of America,\"" Mercer explained to Henry Tazewell on September 13, \""& once they feel--they will rouse--& those latent powers, which they once with so much glory & advantage exerted, will soon get things to right\""--and Mercer had al-  ready chosen to arouse those feelings. The dissemination of Lord Sheffield's Observations and the appearance in the September 11 Pennsylvania Packet of the British orders-in-council of July 2 denying the West Indian trade to American shipping provided the themes for \""North American. No. II.\"" The views expressed in those documents \""operated like an electric Shock\"" in Princeton, Mercer told Tazewell, and Great Britain's \""ungenerous--I had almost said hostile attempt\"" to circumscribe American commerce was based on \""a certainty, that we can never act as a nation--That we can do nothing for our common benefit.\"" In nearly identical language \""The North American\"" asserted a few weeks later that \""the late ungenerous, I may say hostile attack of Great Britain on our commerce, sprang confessedly from an early conviction, that we could not act as a nation; nor concert measures necessary for our mutual benefit and defence.\"" See John Francis Mercer to the Public, ante October 8, 1783. Intensive analysis of Mercer's delegate correspondence and the essays provides numerous parallel expressions and word choices and a nearly exact congruence in the average length of sentence. Moreover, the exaggerated emotion and imagery and the contrived oratorical style of the essays corresponds with delegate testimony concerning Mercer's personality and his behavior on the floor of Congress.  Read's role in transmitting the essays to the publisher of the Pennsylvania Journal on Mercer's behalf undoubtedly stemmed from Mercer's unfavorable reputation among members of Congress and the critical reception the essays would have received if knowledge of their authorship were not carefully protected. Read had taken his seat in Congress only days before the Philadelphia mutiny and the appreciation he shared with Mercer of the political crisis that confronted Congress in September is reflected in their correspondence and their common votes on key issues. Moreover, Read's congenial familiarity with Philadelphia leaders, stemming from earlier visits to the city, made him the logical choice to submit the essays for publication. For a more detailed review of the identification of \""The North American,\"" see Ronald M. Gephart, \""Federal-State Relations in 1783 and the Authorship of 'The North American' Essays,\"" WMQ (forthcoming). Speculation over the identity of \""The North American\"" has had a curious history. In analyzing a James Madison letter to Thomas Jefferson of September 30, 1783, enclosing the first \""North American\"" essay, Edmund C. Burnett conjectured that Madison himself was its author, a claim picked up and elaborated by Irving Brant. As Madison's principal biographer, Brant went far beyond Burnett, however, arranging for the republication of the two \""North American\"" essays in the William and Mary Quarterly in 1946, and publishing a 1954 defense of his claim in the American Historical Review after the editor of The Papers of Thomas Jefferson, Julian Boyd, expressed serious reservations about Madison's authorship. The editors of The Papers of James Madison also found Brant unconvincing, and devoted 27 elaborately reasoned pages to dismissing Brant's arguments, while boldly arguing for Richard Peters' authorship of the two essays. See Burnett, Letters, 7:3l5n.3; Brant, James Madison, 2:302-5; Brant, ed., \""Two Neglected Madison Letters,\"" WMQ 3 (October 1946): 569-87; Jefferson, Papers (Boyd), 6:342n; Brant, \""Madison, the 'North American,' on Federal Power,\"" AHR 60 (October 1954): 45-54; and Madison, Papers (Hutchinson), 7:319-46.

I have received a letter from Madeira with a bill of lading for my pipe of wine which is arrived at Philadelphia in the brig Olive Branch capt John Brice. I enclose you the bill of Lading that you may request Our cousin Robert or Jonathan to get it on shore. I could wish the porters would get some boards to save the stairs and try to put it in the store room. Where if the cask is good as I expect it is it may stand on the end and take up but little room.  I find by the letter that the fine tale of the Prest. either originated in his sanguine temper or that it was fabricated merely to gain custom. However, if the wine be good as I hope it is I am glad I sent for it: but I find I shall be six or seven pounds sterling in debt for it over and above my 22 bbls of flour. There will be 40/ to be paid for the freight and I suppose something for duty on importation which you will please to furnish.  It is uncertain whether I shall have the pleasure of seeing you on Saturday. This days debate may determine it; though I am apprehensive nothing will be decided.

  [September 13, 1783](1) Before passing upon this proclamation, I beg leave to say a few words.  It is impossible that any act of men can be engaged in a business more serious or more solemn, than in deliberating upon an act that is to deprive a human being of his life or character. It will occur to the house that the operation of this act does not merely respect the life or character of Carberry & Sullivan, but extends beyond them, to their relations and even to all those of the same name. If a soldier falls in battle--if an honest man is killed by a robber, or murdered by his enemy, this neither injures his fame, or reflects dishonor on his relations. But the case is far otherwise if he dies under the hands of the law or the executioner. His memory thenceforward is rendered infamous, and to be his relation, or to bear his name, is to cary about one a mark of indelible disgrace.  These observations are recalled to the recollection of the house, to shew us the importance of what we are about.  Let us now for a moment consider the crime of these unfortunate exiles. They were both officers at an early period of the war, and uniformly and till its close, behaved with that fortitude and patience which have so distinguished our army. The situation and circumstances of the army before and at the time of the mutiny need be discribed. They display great virtues--They are pregnant with instruction to this country and full of excuse for the criminals. These unfortunates worn down by poverty and grown desperate by necessity, that power which few persons can resist, formed a plan to releive their wants.  It is certainly an extenuation of their crime, that its object was founded in justice, and that no violence was done to either life, person or property. It is true the soldiers whose motions they are said to have directed, had arms in their hands when they surrounded the State house--But it is also true that they did not use those arms.  But other and more urgent reasons plead that their crime should be forgiven. Let the services and long sufferings of the army be remembered: and let the failings of these men be forgotten in their former merits and in the merits of the army. And let not the first fruits of their long and perilous contest, our peace, be watered with the blood of two of their companions.  SEPTEMBER 13, 1783  I hope it will not be urged that the measure is necessary for the support of our national character. Our national character can never be supported by a sacrifice of national humanity. I have always thought, and the history of all nations teach me that I am right, that acts of mercy serve more to dignify and raise the character of a government than acts of blood. It is said, that Draco's laws were written in blood--but no one has ever dared to praise them.(2) ""

  My dear Sir Princeton Sepr. 13. 1783. Our Ministers in Europe have made some amends for their long silence by voluminous despatches brought down to 27th July. They were recd. yesterday by Congress.(1) No definitive treaty had then been signed by any of the parties, though all had been ready except Holland & America. The fo[rmer] is said to have settled her difficulties. The American Ministers have been endeavoring to incorporate some important commercial stipulations, but in vain; and in case of emergency must come forward with the provisional articles to be signed as the definitive Treaty. The Conduct of G.B. in the negociation with America has shewn great unsteadiness if not insidiousness on the subject of commerce; and the inclosed proclamation of the 2d of July is a proof that some experiment is intended on the wisdom, firmness & union of the States, before they will enter into a Treaty in derogation of her Navigation Act.(2) Congress will probably recommend some defensive plan to the States. If it sd. meet with the fate of former recommendations, it will not probably be owing to Rhode Island whose staple interest more than that of any others lies in carrying between U.S. & the West Indies. If it fails at all it will prove such an inefficacy in the Union as will extinguish all respect for it & reliance on it. My situation here for writing is so incommodious, that you must excuse my brevity.  ""

  Dear Sir Princeton Septr. 13th. 1783.  I lately wrote you(1) enclosing you a state of the determinations in America on the subject of the Cessation of hostilities, since this Dispatches have arriv'd from our Ministers,(2) in which among other explanations required of the Provisional Treaty, it appears, that, captures one month after the signature of the declarative agreement, in all parts of the World north of the Latitude of the Canary Islands were illegal. These dispatches are very lengthy & very important, but I am at present under such injunctions that I do not hold myself at liberty to disclose any of their contents. I may however inform you that no definitive Treaty was signed the 22d of July & I may add (entre' nous) that no progress whatever was made on one--but more of this hereafter. The British act of Council relative to our Commerce, (which vou will find in the enclos'd paper) opens very fully the policy of that Court towards us. There has lately appear'd in England a very artful pamplet. It comes out reputedly as the production of a Lord Sheffield,(3) a young nobleman, who has been ever very inimical towards us--but most probably from the knowledge of facts which it discovers, it is the offspring of some sett of Refugees. Its object is to prevent G. B. entring into any Commercial Treaty whatever, with the United States as a nation. It states that Congress has no legislative power whatever with respect to Commerce & that the interests of the respective States so essentially vary, that no general regulations of a prohibitory kind which they coud recommend, woud probably meet with the approbation of all the different Legislatures. In fine he founds his whole System on what he imagines to be a certainty, that we can never act as a nation--That we can do nothing for our common benefit & consequently that it woud be madness to grant us any  SEPTEMBER 13, 1783  reciprocities in our Commerce, as we cannot exclude them upon their own terms. This Policy has taken strong hold on all ranks in England & seems to have sunk deep into the minds of the ministry. I think yet notwithstanding our gloomy prospects that they will find themselves mistaken & have to rue their ungenerous--I had almost said hostile attempt. There is a great deal of good sense among the People of America & when once they feel--they will rouse--& those latent powers, which they once with so much glory & advantage exerted, will soon set things to rights. Their attempts have here operated like an electric Shock, & I hope their temerity will be the parent of some very happy events for America. I think I have already seen her guardian Genius, commence her operations in this Great Council. We have accepted at length after a delay of three years the Cession of Virginia (some few alterations in the Conditions, but none of material import) So that now Congress have something that they can with certainty call their own. This act was done by 8 States out of 10 who were present--Jersey & Maryland dissenting(4)--the gloomy prospects abroad & above all the accounts we receiv'd from the back Country of a banditti having already in great numbers repair'd to those Theatres of violence, rapine & villainy at length got the better of all the reasons which have heretofore operated--& instead of having this fine Country parcell'd out among Land-Jobbers & torn to peices by a lawless crew of miscreants, we shall shortly lay out a State, which will be instantly settled by our hardy veterans who have petition'd for it--they will go out in a body & form I dare venture to prophecy the best government in the Union--for join'd to a spirit of liberty they possess the principles of subordination--which unhappily for us all--the present States are but too defective in. So that we shall have the present frontiers instantly covered by a band that can well protect them that will be more attach'd to the Union & be more useful to the confOEderacy than any of those now existing. Genl Washington is now with us & has had this matter greatly at heart. The moment it was effected I perceiv'd an instant operation on the very being of Congress--A Total change of Politics in all the States will be a necessary consequence. I begin to hope for the best.  Give my Comps. to Colo. Finnie & tell him that his affairs, are of a difficult digestion, for an example of the nature which he seems to require woud be productive of the most prejudicial & even ruinous consequences in our present Situation.

  Dear Hannah, Saturday Septr. 13 1783. Yesterday the president returned and brought with him the dispatches which came by the Washington Packet, which were so voluminous that the whole day was Spent in reading them;(1) So that the subject about which you are so anxious to hear was not taken up, and whether it will be the subject of this day's debate is altogether Uncertain. There are now ten states represented. But Delaware is still absent. Every day demonstrates & exhibits new proofs of the impropriety & inconveniency of continuing here. But when or where they will move is a subject on which I can form no judgment for reasons mentioned in my former letters.  I am glad we did not conclude to meet this day at Bristol as Congress have agreed to sit. I received no letter by yesterdays stage but hope for the pleasure of one to day. Adieu, dear H, take care of your health. I am with sincere affection, your loving husband, Cha Thomson P.S. I enclose a sheet of Williams writing, it is not quite so good as his last, but it serves as a letter for Page.  ""

  Dear Hannah Monday Sept 15. 1783  I received your very agreeable letters of Thursday & Friday N. 9 & 10. I am extremely sorry that I cannot yet give you any flattering hopes of the speedy return of Congress. They all are sensible of the inconvenience of this place; they all acknowledge it. But one drawing  SEPTEMBER 15, 1783  one way and another, another, they are kept still here, which only breeds more ill humours & keeps the members, and all concerned with them, in a constant fret. The hopes that some had of gratifying their malice and reaking their vengeance on the Superin.(1) are I fancy somewhat abated though the inclination and desire continue as strong as ever. In their last attack they were handled with great freedom, and the ringleader(2) was drawn to solemn asseverations that he was not influenced by personal resentments, but by public motives; though I fancy he was convinced that few believed him.  On Saturday last they agreed to accept on certain terms the cession made by Virginia to the United States of the claims of that state to all the lands beyond the Ohio. This will give a great weight to the authority of Congress. It gives them the sovereignty and property of a country at least five hundred miles square. And whether they make the best use of it or not, I hope it will lay the foundations of liberty still broader by the separate jurisdictions and states that will be erected in that bounds. For by the articles of acceptance they bind themselves to lay it out into distinct and separate states of 150 or 200 miles square or as near thereto as circumstances will admit, and that each of those states shall be members of the fOEderal Union and intitled to all the benefits of it. Some have it in idea to make this country a fund to discharge the debt contracted by the war. The army first to have the lands promised them and so much of the remainder to be sold or assigned to public creditors as will discharge the debt. Maryland & Jersey however are not yet satisfied. They think that all the country which lies beyond the Allegheny Mountains and which was unsettled at the commencement of the war and which belonged to the crown of GB & was by it ceded to the United states in the articles of the peace ought to be thrown onto a common stock and disposed of for the benefit of the union. They think that Virginia, the Carolinas and Georgia have no right in virtue of antiquated charters to a country gained by the blood & treasure and by the common exertions of the whole. And in this they have a great deal of reason & justice on their side. However I am pleased that so much is like to be peaceably obtained. Adieu my dear Hannah.

The definitive Treaty was not signed on the 2d of August nor likely to be signed, sooner than the 1st Septr. in my Opinion, if then. The Proceedings of our warm People & the precipitate opening of the Trade with England, are the principle Causes of Delay. Our Commissioners are decided, and it was so understood at the negociation, that Hostilities were to cease in these Seas in one Month from the ratification of the Preliminary Articles.  Mr. Jay Means to resign in the Spring. Mr Dana is yet at Petersburgh and notwithstanding all that has passed, intends finishing His Treaty, before he returns.  Our Affairs here, go rather indifferently. No Minister of foreign Affairs--all the foreign Papers sealed up--At a distance from our offices--Members grumbling & dissatisfied at our remaining at this Place--no great appetite for Business--so that we are not in so comfortable a State, as I could wish.

I have received a Letter from Mr Tracy of the 2nd, & he informs me the Money is ready, but should any Disappointment arise, shew this Letter to Mr Russel & he will supply You with Specie for the purchase. Colo Orne must shew that he is authorized to fix a price by the owners, by an agreement under their Hands, before You can with propriety say whether You will buy or sell; & if the owners will not previously agree to give him this power, You must keep your Intentions of purchasing, & especially of the Sum you will give to Yourself, & let the Vessel be vendued: in which Case employ Capt Stacy or C Grush to bid her off for me, & not to let it be known for whom they are bidding, or how high they are to go, untill the Vessel is sold.

  Dear Sir [September 16? 1783](1)  I have this Week received a Letter from Govr. Livingston informing that he has had a number of applications for the Purchase of his Interest in the Oriskie Patent,(2) which he has refused on account of his Promise to Colo. Floyd of the first Offer: he says he has wrote to Colo Floyd but has received no answer and requests to know, as he understood I was concerned, whether we are still disposed to purchase or whether he is released from his Promise & is at Liberty to dispose of that Interest to any other Person. I have wrote to him(3) for Answer that we are still disposed to make the Purchase provided the Price can be agreed on and have desired him to let me know the Terms he proposed to Colo Floyd which I would immediately communicate to him so that he might have an answer as soon as possible. I did not choose to goe further in this Business till I could have an oppertunity of hearing from your Excellency, and have your Opinion upon the highest Sum it would answer for us to give; As he has offers for his Interest I expect he will ask a much higher Price than he would have done before & will be very uneasy under his Promise of a Refusal till the Bargain is closed, and I think it will be for our Interest to make the purchase soon, if at all. If you are still of the Opinion that it is best buy those Lands, I beg you will write to me by the first oppertunity & say how far I may offer, provided there is no probability of getting it for a less sum, and I will, without waiting to hear from Colo. Floyd, proceed to make the Purchase as soon as possible.(4) Last week Congress accepted of the Virginia Cession provided the Condition of Guarantie and the Expence of conquering & defending that Country, mentioned in their Act is repealed & there is no  SEPTEMBER 16, 1783  doubt now but that State will agree to the Proposals. In Such Case all the Lands Northwest of the Ohio by this Cession and the Cession of New York will be vested in the United States, which with Attention may become a Fund for absorbing a great Part of our domestic Debt. This Cession also will I trust quiet all Claims by other States on our Western Territories. We have lately received Letters from our Commissioners at Paris, most of the Communications are under an Injunction of Secrecy for a few Days after which Time I shall do myself to transmit to your Excellency what is most interesting. We have no News of the Definitive Treatys being signed nor is there any appearance of a commercial Treaty being agreed to, On the contrary there appears by the public Papers an evident intention in Great Britain to prevent these States trading with them or their Islands on reciprocal advantages which I believe will be much to our advantage in the End, as it will oblige our merchants to form Connections in other Nations whose Prejudices are not so great against the Success of our Trade or their own Navigation Acts.

  My Dear Sir, Princeton September 16. 1783. By a Letter which I have received from Judge Platt I am informed that he expects in a few Days from this Time to goe on the Mohawks River and to have our Lands Apprised & laid out; he expects to get  SEPTEMBER 16, 1783  the necessary Information from Mr. Banyar. I hope he may, but fear he will not: if he does not, I expect he will receive it from another Quarter of which he will inform you.  I understand that it is proposed by those concerned in Fundys Lands, to prevent Difficulties which they apprehend may Attend the Title, to cover the same Lands with Class or the other Certificates.  I approve of this measure as better calculated to insure Success than the Ground on which we formerly depended; tho' this mode will not clear the Title of all Embarrisments. I cannot readily beleive that the Legislature will ever intermedelle to distroy a Title to Land for which they have received as valuable a Consideration as they would have done provided the Title was in the state.  I should be glad to have One or Two Thousand acres more in this Purchase if the same can be procured and you think Certificates can be obtained at a Price you think will answer. I understood by you when at Albany last, if I remember right, that there were some of our Company Certificates that were not so fixed, but that you could cover any Lands with them you should think best: if so I should be glad you would with my Part, if they are not already disposed of, cover my Interest in Fundys Land which is about I believe 2000 Acres and what you may further purchase for me. If you want Money for the Purchase call on Mr Arnold who will advance it, or on Mr White who I expect will be at Albany soon and will receive my money of Arnold.  As you will be on the spot and will be fully acquainted with all the Circumstances relative to this Business, especially whether Certificates can be got and at what Price; I desire you will act for me as you do for your self, and should be glad to hear from you on this Subject as soon as convenient. I have had the Honour to write to you once before, since I have been at this Place, but have not been favoured with your Answer.  We have yet no Account of the Definitive Treaty being signed, nor is there any Appearance of a commercial Treaty being agreed to. Great Britain still blunders, they mean to embarras the American Trade with their Territories, which conduct will oblige the People of this Country to form Connection & Trade in other Kingdoms, much to our Advantage.

  My dear Hannah Tuesday Septr. 16. 1783. I am now inclined to believe you were right in your conjecture that those who do not wish to return to Philadelphia will while away the SEPTEMBER 16, 1783  time till the first Monday in October the day assigned for considering of a proper place for the permanent residence of Congress. I find now that when they are asked why they do not decide upon the place proper for the temporary residence of Congress which was agreed to be done on Friday last the answer is that the time for determining on the permanent residence is so near that it is not worth while to trouble themselves about a temporary residence until that is decided.  Yesterday was taken up in a most curious debate. A foreigner, a native of the east Indies had entered our service as a sailor in 1778 or 1779. He had served on board the Bon Homme Richard under Capt J. P. Jones and in the celebrated action with the Serapis had lost a leg, by which he is disabled from procuring a living. He and two others in like condition had applied more than a twelve month ago to obtain something to support them. His request not having been complied with this poor stranger came to this town and presented himself to the members. The remembrance of the gallant action performed, his maimed condition, distressed looks and modest deportment naturally raised compassion and yesterday his case was considered. Had he been a citizen of any of the United states, he would have been comprehended under an Act which passed in 1776 and which granted to such objects half pay for life. But being a stranger and foreigner he had nothing to rest on but the bounty and Compassion of Congress. And unfortunately for him Mr. Morris as agent of marine had recommended that he should be paid a pension of 40 dollars a year during his life. This recommendation was sufficient to excite the opposition of those whose malice seems so inveterate that they would risque their salvation to ruin the man & trample on every feeling of humanity & violate every law of Justice to gratify their resentment. However after a great deal of debate which consumed the day in spite of the opposition of Higgenson, Bland and Ellery, the grant was made, and the poor fellows prevented from starving in our streets after having lost their limbs in our service.(1) I have received your letter of Sunday N.11. I am very sorry for your disappointment which accounts to me for your not being in a pleasant humour. I thank Dick most heartily for his politeness and comp[l]aisance in endeavouring to solace his mistress with a song & to charm her into good humour by his warbling notes. I hope Page rewarded him with at least two spiders. I approve your Arrangements respecting the wine. Enclosed I send you for your amusement a medal invented by Doct.

  My dear Sir, Princeton Sepr. 17th. 1783. Not having expected Mr. Higgenson's going so soon, I have but a moment to write you. His conduct in Congress has been that of an able & upright friend to his Country; & I therefore much regret his leaving us.(1) He will communicate to you all News we have here. My private Letters give me reason to expect that the definitive treaty will soon arrive. I have thought it my duty to move Congress for information from the Super-intendant of Finance, what Cloathing has been purchasd. with the public money & why the Soldiers have not receivd what was orderd by Congress.(2) The Super-intendant has answerd, that he does not know what has been purchasd, & that he thought it was more proper to Sell the Cloathing than distribute it to the Soldiery. In laying out the public money Commissions accrue to his freinds, in selling the things so purchasd, new Commissions arise to the Sellers. In this case, it is his Clerk Mr. Swanwick who is to have this emolument. In the mean time the Soldiers have been 15 months without their cloathing tho two millions of dollars have been taken out of the public Coffers for that purpose. Thus while fallacious reports on this man's conduct are publishd in all the Papers, & his tools are filling the Papers with praises calculated to deceive the public; the public SEPTEMBER 17, 1783  money is lavishd away, the Soldiery, defrauded & the public plundered. I wish this matter were stated in Your Papers. Those of Philadelphia are altogether in his pay.  I hope the location of my Grant is made & well made; & shall be obligd to you for information on the subject.(3) I beg my best respects to Mrs. Warren & the rest of your Family, & when you see that of Mr. Bodwoin [Bowdoin], that you will have the goodness to remember me to them.  Farewell, A. Lee(4)  P.S. I enclose you the motions I made relative to the Soldiers Cloathing, with the short speech which introduced them together with an Account of the Monies said to have been laid out in purchasing Cloathing, but not accountd for. All this you will put into the Papers if you see fit.  ENCLOSURE  Mr. A. Lee having in his place stated to Congress That he had seen a part of the Massachusetts line march thro' Princeton, & observing that the Soldiers were ill-cloathd, & knowing that much larger Sums of public money had been chargd as laid out for cloathing than woud have cloathed the whole Army compleatly, & that by a Resolve of Congress the Army shoud have receivd Cloathing once a year; he enquird of the Commanding Officer of those Troops, how it happend that the Soldiers were so ill cloathd; & having been informd by him that the Soldiers had not receivd their Cloathing the last twelve months, but that their Uniforms were turnd & new facd, which information was farther confirmd by a General Officer with this addition that the Soldiers were obligd to sell their Certificates at Philadelphia for part even of what they wore: Mr. A. Lee thought it his duty to his Country & to the Soldiery to move the following Resolution:(5)  Sums of Money laid out for Soldiers Cloathing since Mr. Morris came into Office to the 1st of March 1782.  Purchasd by Mr. Morris of Mr. Holker 181,789 dlls. Brought over by Col.

  Dear Hannah Wednesday Sept 17 1783  Another day is passed in disputations which though they did not wound the feelings of humanity as those of the day before, yet excited no less indignation, being founded on ignorance as well as malice. In 1781 an Arrangement had been formed for the marine department with a secretary at the head of it whose salary was fixed at 4000 dollars a year. To this office major genl. McDougal was elected, but he declined accepting it unless he might retain his rank in the army.(1) And this not being agreed, the election became void. The arrangement was then changed and an Agent of marine was to be placed at the head of it with a salary of 1500 dollars a year; but not being able to fix on a person to fill the Office Congress resolved that until an Agent of marine could be appointed, the duties of his Office should be devolved on & executed by the Superintendant of finance.(2) A remonstrance was lately received from the legislature of Massachusetts complaining of the expense of the civil list.(3) This afforded a favourable opportunity to the junto. For finding the Superintendt. in the exercise of the duties of Agent of marine and not remembering or knowing what was passed, they thought he was the agent and intitled to the salary in addition to what he received as Superint. and that by abolishing the office they would not only lessen his dignity but also lower his income. Bland had a few days before violently opposed the sale of the frigate alliance: He then saw the necessity of having a marine force and hoped the U.S. would never lose sight of it; He ob- SEPTEMBER 18, 1783  served and with reason that the time of peace was the time for laying the foundation of a marine without which it was impossible for them to be a commercial nation or to be respectable at home or abroad. But now the Super. being held up to his view all this fine reasoning was forgotten, & the house was dinned with the absurdity of continuing an Agent when we had no navy. This wise debate consumed the day, and nothing was done.  I had not the pleasure of hearing from you yesterday. I am informed that it is very sickly in town. I hope you are careful of your health.

  Dear Sir. Princeton 17th September 1783 Mr. Nathl Lawrence informs me that his name is left out of the list in the last return of the officers of the North Carolina line now in the office of the Secretary at War. If his name was designedly left out he conceives himself much injured. This young Gentleman is a native of New York Governt. joined our army in Pennsylvania & was appointed second Lieutenant of the 2d North Carolina Regiment as appears by a certificate signed by Colonel Patton. His appointment was on the first of June 1778. Twelve months after that time viz on the first of June 1779 Mr. Lawrence was taken prisoner with the Garrison at fort la Fayette on the North River. Capt. Thomas Armstrong was taken at the same time. Mr Lawrence continued a prisoner, chiefly on long Island 'til the 28th March 1781 when he was exchanged and was refered by the Commander in chief to General Greene for orders. The General in his answer which is dated high hills of Santee 18th of August --81 informs Mr Lawrence, that from the then deranged State of the North Carolina line he could give no definitive answer respecting his rank nor whether he should be considered supernumary. In the mean while gives him permssion to stay in the State of New York. That he would inform him when the matter should be ascertained. General Howe afterwards took Mr Lawrence into his family and engaged to write to Genl. Greene on the subject; since that time the campain being inactive Mr Lawrence returned to live with some of his friends in the Country.  SEPTEMBER 18, 1783  There appears by the last arrangement the names of several Officers who were taken into the service so late as Septembr 1780. Perhaps it will be said that Mr Lawrence, whenever he was exchanged without money or the means of travelling should have travelled to General Greene's Camp instead of writing to him in order to receive his orders. I do not know what flaw there may have been in his conduct according to military rules: but I shall venture to say that the spirit of military honor as well as the honor & Justice of the State leave us no room to doubt who, at the end of the war has the best claim to protection or pay, the man who has fought several times and been imprisoned for years in the service of his Country or the Soldier of Yesterday, who never smelt powder unless when shooting at a squirrel. I need not add that I am pursuaded you will cause this matter to be enquired into, and that Mr Lawrence will eventually neither have occasion to complain of the partiality nor injustice of the State of North Carolina or its officers. I have the honor &c, Hugh Williamson P.S. If Mr. Lawrence has been left out in the arrangement from any breach or neglect of duty I am altogether uninformed of the circumstances. He is thought merely to have been overlooked.  ""

  My dear Hannah, Thursday Sept. 18. 1783 Another day is spent in ill humour and fruitless debates. The subject was to satisfy the Eastern states & reconcile them to the commutation agreed to be given to the Officers in lieu of the half pay that had been promised them. You know that in the midst of the war, when the army was exposed to hunger and nakedness, and their pay was reduced to a trifle by the depreciation of the paper money or, according to the phrase then in vogue, by the advanced price of the necessaries of life, the officers became discontented and wanted to resign. In Order to satisfy them, the Congress at York town agreed that such as continued in service to the end of the war should be intitled to and receive after the war was over their full pay for seven years,(1) provided they lived so long. The benefit of this was afterwards extended to the widows & children of such as died in the service. Still however the army was discontented. They wanted a provision for life; that after wearing out their constitution in the service of their country they might not, in their old age, be exposed to want and misery. The continent was much divided on this subject. The eastern states were in general averse to it, as it seemed to encourage the idea of a standing army, the other states favoured the measure. It was long a subject of debate. At length however, our finances being exhausted, our affairs gloomy, the discontents of the army encreasing, and assurances being given that this would satisfy them, & it appearing to be the only means in the power of Congress to prevent a dissolution of the army, some of the eastern states gave way and in Sept 1780 Congress resolved that such of the officers as continued in service to the end of the war should be intitled to half pay for life.(2) But though the eastern states from the necessity of the case agreed to the measure, the genius or prejudices of the people were against it, and therefore the officers saw that they could not enjoy that bounty with peace and satisfaction. You know what influence a word has upon the passions of the people. The word pension which conveyed an Odious idea was applied to the half pay, and a cry was raised, that the conclusion of the war would saddle the country with a band of pensioners. The merit and sufferings of the army were acknowledged, and it was alledged and asserted that the people would readily agree to give them an ample compensation; but that they could not agree to pay them annually a sum for life, which would only encourage idleness and dissipation and create an odious distinction among the citizens. To obviate all objections the officers at the close of last campaign offered to receive a sum in gross in lieu of the half pay promised. This was one of the objects of the deputation from the army <<in January last> last fall.(3) After long debates and strong symptoms of a most dangerous mutiny in the whole army, it was at last agreed by Congress, that the Officers should be entitled to the value of five years full pay as a commu[ta]tion for the half pay; that all their accounts and claims should be liquidated & settled, and that certificates should be given to each of them for the balance due including the commutation; that this should be funded with the general debt of the nation; and that the interest thereof should be paid annually until the principal could be discharged. And Congress proceeded to call upon the states to grant and establish funds for the regular payment of the interest and discharge of the principal of the whole national debt. The states to the eastward, it seems, are dissatisfyed with this arrangement, and the legislature of Massachusetts has remonstrated to Congress against the allowance to the army and the expence of the civil list. This remonstrance was referred to a committee, who reported an Answer with reasons to shew that Congress could not, con- SEPTEMBER 18,1783  sistent with public faith, honor justice and humanity, make any alteration in the commutation, but that they were disposed as far as was consistent with the public good to reduce the expences of the civil list. This report not being satisfactory to the eastern delegates was committed to three of them who brought in another report which has engaged the attention of Congress for these two days past, and is likely to engage it for some time to come.(4) The report began with a proposal to abolish the marine department or at least reduce it to an Agent with a triffling salary. This afforded a favourable opportunity to those who wished to have a stroke at the Superint. of finance, who they conceived was the agent & received the emoluments. And as every subject wherein he is concerned is agitated with great warmth & bitterness, this employed the whole of the first day. Yesterday what regarded the civil list was referred to a new committee, and the latter part of the report which related to the commutation was taken into consideration. The report proposed that Congress should pass a resolution, by which the states should be left to settle with the Officers of their respective lines on the best terms they could and to take up the certificates given to the officers & have them discounted at the public treasury in discharge of the requisitions of Congress. This was opposed as a measure tending to violate the public faith pledged to the officers, to throw them upon the mercy of the states and to deprive them of the hard and well earned rewards of their meritorious services. It was supported on the other hand as necessary to the peace and tranquility of the states and to the preservation of the Union. Read opposed it with great warmth, McHenry & Madison with great force of reason & argument. Holten who was in favour of the measure & who is a worthy good man but of weak nerves seemed to be deeply affected with apprehensions of the consequences, urged it with great seriousness & deep Concern, pointing out the dangers & deprecating the evil consequences that might ensue from a refusal. Ellery, who was also in favour of it, and who has a predominant passion to be thought a wit, and whose wit indeed, though far from being acute or refined, much surpasses his judgment or honesty, endeavoured to represent the half pay as extorted from the fears of Congress; and as he scorns to confine his fancy within the bounds of truth, he boldly attempted to impose on the members by the grossest falshoods, in which however he was immediately detected. But to cover his confusion, he endeavoured to turn the Attention of the house by an attack upon the secretary(5) who had contributed of the detection. In this he was also foiled. And he was obliged to sit still under the disgrace of having either lost his wit or his memory or of having no regard to truth.  I am indeed heartily weary of this scene and if it continues much longer, I am inclined to think I shall wish to withdraw from it. Still however I entertain a fond hope that the same kind providence which SEPTEMBER 19, 1783  has conducted us so far in our journey will open a way for the future happiness and prosperity of the United States. To his protection I recomend you and Am with sincere Affection, your loving husband,  Cha Thomson  ""

  Dear Sir Princeton, 19th Sept. 1783  It is with great anxiety that we were informed that your Excellency has fallen under a dangerous Illness. We were therefore much comforted by Colo. Benson's Favours of the and the Instant(1) which gave us Hopes that the Severity of the disorder was greatly abated, and we flatter ourselves that before long your Health will be reestablished, and that you will be enabled to return to the Duties of your Station with Satisfaction to yourself and with those great Advantages to the public which they have experienced from your Zeal and Patriotism.  We have laid before Congress your Excellencys Correspondence with Sir Guy Carleton.(2) We did not propose it should be the ground of any immediate Act of Congress, but conceived that useful Purposes might be answered if it should become necessary to investigate Sir Guy's Conduct. Besides we thought the Honour of our Government was concerned in preserving that Correspondence entire, which Sir Guy had mutilated by transmitting but a single Letter of his own out of all that passed between you.  Congress have at length decided upon the Virginian Cession of western Territories. That State, it is thought, has insisted upon hard Terms. We have never the less agreed to them for Two Reasons: Because it was a Subject which could only be closed by Composition; and because there is now left as the undoubted Right of the United States an immense Tract of Country which is daily overrun by lawless men (who endanger by their Rashness a new Indian War) and which might be improved to great public Advantage. We need not add that it has a SEPTEMBER 19, 1783  further Tendency to silence Questions respecting the western Territories which have proved a great obstacle to public Business and might have been a source of internal Contentions and Convulsions.  We inclose a printed Report which was agreed to and approved by Congress as amended.(3) With our earnest Wishes for your Excellency's Health and Happiness, We have the Honour to be most respectfully, Dear Sir, Your Excellencys most Obedient & very Humble Servant, Jas Duane E L'Hommedieu ""

  Dear Sir, Princeton September 20 1783  Your favour of the 8th I am honoured with, and highly approved of your Conduct in offering Mr Ranseliar the 200 Acres: I beleive it will be the most effectual Argument that could be used to put an End to, and accomplish our Views. I am glad to find you have so high opinion of the Location, and I have every assurance from Nathl Platt that the Certificates will be ready whenever called for; and whenever you shall want them. I beg you will be pleased to call on him for my part. You may depend there shall be no disappointment on my Part respecting the Certificates; for even if Plat should fail I can procure them another way.  I see the force of your objection against covering Fundys Land with Class Certificates, it is the same I made to Judge Platt in a Letter I wrote to him1 on the subject & which he probably will shew you. I approved of the measure on this Principle: If Fundy obtains a Patent in Consequence of the Indian Purchase, it becomes a President for confirming all Indian Purchases which many of the Legislature are much opposed to. If it is covered with Certificates the State will have received an equal Value for this Land with any other which have been located, and Persons locating having the Indian Title, it becomes a law excepted from the general objection of comprising Indian Purchases, and in such Case I do not see what objections the state could have against gra[n]ting the Land. However as I mentioned in my last Letter(2) I shall refer the matter to you & Company & whatever you think best to be done I shall fully acquiesce in. I am glad you have it in Idea to see me on Long Island this fall, It would give me great Satisfaction to see you & Mrs Taylor Their. I fear we shall be disappointed: by the general Accounts from New York it is not expected the British will leave that City till the last of November. If they do not goe before I fear they will keep Possession of that Place & Long Island 'till Spring; for I believe they will think it too late after November to risk Troops to Europe. I shall leave this Place in a few weeks when I shall consider myself as a Free man in respect to my being bound further to attend Congress or the Legislature of the State.

  Dear Sir Princeton Sepr. 20. 1783. Your favor of the 31 ult.(1) came to hand yesterday. As the reason which chiefly urged my departure for Virga. has ceased I have been led to protract my attendance on Congress by the interest I felt in some measures on foot, and the particular interest which my Constituents have in them. Two of these were the territorial cession and the permanent seat of Congress. The former was a few days ago put into a form which I hope will meet the ultimatum of Virginia.(2) The first Monday in next month is fixed for a decision of the latter; after which it may still be necessary to choose a temporary residence untill the permanent one can be made ready. I am utterly unable to foretell how either of these points will be determined. It is not impossible that an effective vote may be found attainable on neither; in which case the winter must be spent in this village where the public business can neither be conveniently done, the members of Congress decently provided for nor those connected with Congress provided for at all.(3) I shall lose no time in looking out for quarters for you & entering into provisional engagements in your favor. Your other request relative to Miss Patsy shall be equally attended to as soon as I go to Philada. which will probably be towards the end of next week.(4) It will give me real concern if we should miss of one another altogether in the journies before us; and yet I foresee the danger of it. Mr. Jones & myself will probably be on the road by the middle of next month or a few days later. This is the time about which you expect to commence your journey. Unless therefore we travel the same road a disappointment of even an interview will be unavoidable. At present our plan is to proceed thro' Baltimore, Alexandria & Fredericksbg. and we may possibly be at the races of the second place. I am at a loss by what regulation I can obey your wishes with regard to the notes I have on hand; having not yet made any copy of them, having no time now for that purpose, and being unwilling for several reasons to leave them all behind me. A disappointment however will be of the less con- SEPTEMBER 20, 1783  sequence, as they have been much briefer & more interrupted since the period at which you run them over, and have been altogether discontinued since the arrival of Congs. here.(5) My plan of spending this winter in Philada in close reading was not entirely abandoned untill Congress left that City and shewed an utter disinclination to returning to it. The prospect of agreeable & even instructive society was an original consideration with me; and the subsequent one of having yours added to it would have confirmed my intention after the abortive issue of another plan, had not the solicitude of a tender & infirm parent exacted a visit to Virga. and an uncertainty of returning been thereby incurred.(6) Even at present, if Congs. sd make Philada. their seat this winter & I can decline a visit to Virga. or speedily get away from it, my anxiety on the subject will be renewed.  Our last inf ormation from Europe is dated the 27th July.(7) France & Spain were then ready for the definitive signing of the Peace. Holland was on the point of being so. The American Plenipos. had done nothing on the subject and in case of emergency could only sign the provisional Treaty as final. Their negociations had been spent chiefly on commercial stipulations from which G.B. after very different professions & appearances, altogether drew back. The ready admission she found into our commerce without paying any price for it has suggested the policy of aiming at the entire benefit of it, and at the same time saving the carriage of the W. India trade the price she at first bid for it. The supposed contrariety of interests among the States and the impotence of the fOEderal Govt. are urged by the ministerial pamphleteers as a safeguard agst. retaliation. The other nations of Europe seem to have more honorable views towards our commerce, sundry advances having been made to our Ministers on that subject.  Congress have come to no decision even as yet on any of the great branches of the peace establishment. The military branch is supported and quickened by the presence of the Commander in chief, but without any prospect of a hasty issue. The department of foreign affairs both internal & external remains as it has long done. The election of a Secy. has been an order of the day for many months without a vote being taken. The importance of the marine department has been diminished by the sale of almost all the Vessels belonging to the U.S. The department of Finance is an object of almost daily attack and will be reduced to its crisis on the final resignation of Mr. M. which will take place in a few months.(8) The War office is connected with the Military establishment & will be regulated I suppose in conformity to what that may be. Among other subjects which divide Congress, their Constitutional authority touching such an establishment in time of peace is one. Another still more puzzling is the precise jurisdiction proper for Congress within the limits of their permanent seat.(9) As these points may possibly remain undecided till Novr. I mention them  SEPTEMBER 20,1783  particularly that your aid may be prepared. The investigation of the Mutiny ended in the condemnation of several Sergeants who were stimulated to the measure without being apprized of the object by the two officers who escaped. They have all recd. a pardon from Congress. The real plan & object of the mutiny lies in profound darkness. I have written this in hopes that it may get to Monticello before you leave it. It might have been made more interesting if I had brought the Cypher from Philada. tho' my present situation required a great effort to accomplish as much as I have. I am obliged to write in a position that scarcely admits the use of any of my limbs, Mr. Jones & myself being lodged in this room not 10 feet square and without a single accommodation for writing.

  Dear General: Princeton, September 20, 1783. I have the pleasure of yours, of the 9th, but am by no means decided on the debt. I rather think you stand in arrears to me two or three very long epistles.  The last week I directed a letter to Mr. Fitzhugh, which is to be considered in a great measure a joint one,(1) the first part I am sorry you have not yet given me occasion to consider as such.  I stated almost every article of intelligence from Europe that I can now hold myself at liberty to communicate--but would observe, that France has given us every assurance that the definitive treaty shall not be signed without us--at the same time, they hint that our own facility in running into British commerce, &c., and the little appearance of concert between the different states, has retarded the general negotiation. However, we have reason to apprehend that not only Great Britain, but all the other European powers, even our friends, will pursue the object of deriving advantages from our commerce, without allowing us reciprocity--for if one European nation does this, the others must pursue the same policy or submit to subject themselves to great disadvantages.  We are pursuing the peace arrangement, but under many discouragements, which damp our ardor. I hope, however, all difficulties may be surmounted, and all measures so necessary and salutary, may be completed. I am under the pressure of land debates, and must conclude with assuring you that any thing that shall offer which will correspond with your wishes, shall with the utmost zeal be promoted by, Dr. General, Your friend, and very h'ble Servant, J.

See Madison, Papers (Hutchinson), 7:312-13.  2 This information had been communicated by the chevalier de La Luzerne to a committee of Congress appointed to receive confidential communications \""agreeably to his request,\"" but it was not announced publicly until the following April.

  [September 25? 1783]  The Comee. appointed to consider the dispatches from the foreign Ministers & to report what measures are necessary for Congress to take thereupon; have very attentively perused their dispatches & submit the follow'g report.(1)  1. It appears clearly from Mr. Adam's letters of the 23d of June and 14th & 18th of July; the Ministers joint letter of July 27th & Dr. Franklin's letter of the 22d July, that the Courts of France & Great Britain particularly the latter, hath discovered the utmost Jealousy of the commercial Prosperity(2) of America--that they have it in contemplation not only to cramp & restrain our commerce, by prohibiting an intimate & extensive intercourse between America and their West India possessions, but to deprive us as much as possible of the carrying trade by prohibiting any American Vessel from importing into G. Britain any commodities, but those of the State to which it belongs. Your Committee consider this System of Policy as most pernicious(3) to the interests of America; for should we be deprived of a direct trade with the British & French West India Islands, & of carrying the produce of those Islands to Europe, great sources of wealth & convenience to the United States will be lost. Should the other restriction take place, and the Vessels of each of the American States be confined to the importation into G. Britain, of the exports from that State only, a great part of the carrying trade which arises from the exportation of American produce to Europe, will be engrossed by Europeans, the great nursery for seamen will be in a good degree lost, and a very important & profitable branch of commerce, be transferred from the Citizens of these United States to Foreigners--it is therefore of the highest importance in the opinion of your Com- SEPTEMBER 25, 1783  mittee, especially as these restrictions are probably only a part of a system which if carried into effect must prove compleatly ruinous to the American Commerce--that a General Power be somewhere lodged for regulating the concerns of the United States: for should those restraining Systems be pursued by Britain & France and other states which will probably be drawn into(4) the same system, some regulations to exclude them from our carrying trade, will be absolutely necessary, or they may eventually become the sole carriers even of our own produce. On this head your Comee. submit to the Consideration of Congress(5) whether it may not be expedient to appoint a special Comee. to prepare an address to the States on the subject of Commerce stating to them the commercial Regulations which are prevailing(6) in Europe, the evils we apprehend and the proper steps on their part to guard against and counteract(7) them... and 2. to report measures necessary to be taken by Congress, among which may perhaps be reckoned treaties of Amity & Commerce with the other Great Powers in Europe, & the residence of an able Minister or Agent at the Court of London.  3. That it appears also from those dispatches, particularly from the letter of July 18th from Mr. Adams; that not only a continuation but an additional cement to the Union is necessary--that if the United States do ever become a great, a powerful & a flourishing Nation, respectable in Commerce & in Arms, it must be by having a well formed fOEderal Government, sufficiently effective to collect the resources of the Country to a point when necessary, & to make such general arrangements whether of a Commercial or political nature, as circumstances may from time to time require--for as it is clearly not the interest of any maratime European Power, to promote rapidly our encrease in numbers & in wealth, on the contrary they appear apprehensive of our growing importance; We may expect if we are not attentive to our own interests, & have not energy enough to secure our own honour, to be treated with insult & disrespect by them all in their turns. 4. Your Comee. would therefore propose the appointment of a special Comee. to deliberate on this Head. It appears farther from Mr. Adam's letter of and Dr. Frank- lin's letter of 22d July, that propositions for entering into treaties of Amity & Commerce have been made to our Ministers, by the King of Denmark, the Court of Portugal, the Emperor of Germany the King of Prussia, the Grand Duke of Tuscany, the Court of Spain and that all the other Powers of Europe discover a like disposition. A Special Comee. is recommended on this subject, to consider whether general outlines of treaties with those several Powers, or instructions to our Ministers as to the principles of such treaties, shall be forwarded & to report the necessary forms in either case. Letters should be written to our Ministers directing them to stop all loans in Europe, to make all necessary representations to the Court of Denmark for obtaining restitution for the Prizes sent into Bergen by the Alliance--to  inform Congress why the expedition of the Ships Alliance and Bon homme Richard &ca. was at the expence & on the account of the Court of France--whether any part of the profit arising therefrom accrued to the United States, or any of the expence attending it was charged to them--whether any of the proceeds of the Prizes taken by those Ships remains in Europe, that is due to the American Officers & seamen employed in that expedition, the amount thereof & in whose hands it is deposited--to approve their encouraging overtures for treaties of Amity & Commerce, from the respectable & commercial Powers in Europe, and direct them to form none but upon terms of the most perfect reciprocity & subject to the revisal of Congress previous to their being ratified, to enclose to them the resolutions of Congress, instructing Mr. Dana with respect to his entering into stipulations relative to the system of the Armed Neutrality--to approve of their intention of adopting the Provisional Treaty as a definitive Treaty, in case they cannot agree with the British Minister as to any additional articles or explanations--to empower them or any two of them to make to Mr. Wren, who has acted a very kind & humane part to the Americans when Prisoners in England, such presents as they may think decent & adequate to his merits, not exceeding £500 stlg. and in the name of the United States--to direct Mr. Carmichael to repair to Paris with the books & papers necessary to make a final & compleat adjustment of the public accounts, that are under the controul of him and Mr. Jay agreeable to Mr. Jay's letter of the 1st June last--to give Mr. Jay permission to go to England to recover his health agreeable to his request in a letter of July 20th--to direct the Ministers not to encourage the application of Foreigners to be appointed Consuls in Europe, it being the determination of Congress to appoint Americans only as Consuls, to give to the Ministers in Europe, one and all of them, 5. permission to return to America, after the definitive Treaty is perfected & forwarded, except in cases where they or any of them, may be negociating business to which they have been especially commissioned or directed, in such cases to direct them to perfect that business before they leave Europe, and in every case to give Congress the earliest notice of the time they expect to return.  6. Your Committee would propose that a Committee be appointed to prepare draughts of the letters necessary to take up the points above stated. They further report that it is in their opinion highly necessary for Congress to go soon into the consideration of the report on Mr. Laurens' letters, & proper instructions sent to our Ministers in Europe, to enable them to pursue the very important objects recommended in that report.(8)   ""

The result will soon be known as their Legislature will be convened next month.  It is now three years since Congress recommended to the States to make liberal cessions of their claims to Western territory. Three cessions only have been made, one was accepted last year, Viz. N. York; another has been repealed since the return of peace, Viz. Connecticutt; and it has been suggested that Virginia was about opening her land office. No. Carolina & Georgia have opened their land offices & it is said are making every arrangement to dispose of their back lands to advantage. Thus Situated Congress have been induced to accept a cession of Virginia far short of what she ought to have made. And the proclamation mentioned in a letter to gov. Bowen has passed the House.(3) Eight States agreed to the cession.  The Territory which will be vested in Congress should Virginia agree to our proposals will include, it is said by the most knowing, about five hundred thousand square miles--A territory about five hundred times as large as the State of R. Island.  SEPTEMBER 25, 1783  No. Carolina & Georgia it is hoped will deem themselves bound to follow the Example at least of ceding a proportional share of their claims. It is in contemplation, at least with some in Congress to apply specially to those States.  For sundry particulars I must beg leave to refer you to a late letter to the gov. signed by Mr. Ellery & myself.(4) That letter is in a legible hand writing--on which account I hope our friends will more readily excuse its length.  I am not a little mortified that none of my friends have yet vouchsafed to answer any of my Letters excepting Mrs Howell writes me weekly & Dr. Arnold has written me a few Letters, which are all I have received--perhaps a friend of mine the other day hit on the true reason. He said that probably you found trouble enough in reading them.  Yesterday was celebrated the anniversary commencement in this Town.(5) Gen. Washington & sundry others of distinction, besides Congress, attended. For an account of the Exercises I shall refer you to the newspapers. Thirteen Alumni were gratuated Bachelors in the Arts. Several were graduated Masters. The degree of Doctor in Divinity was conferred on three or four--as they were strangers to me I do not recollect their names.  The day before yesterday was spent on the Subject of directing the L. Officers to issue certificates for intrest, &c. It was much opposed: and the grounds of the opposition went also to the requisition of Sept. 4. 1782. It was said that the whole of the intrest due was included in the estimate of our national debt for which provision was made in the arrangements of March 18th last; & that, of course, this requisition ought to be remitted, & considered as absorbed in the other. Thus do I find myself extremely embarrassed by what has been done in my absence. Those who are steadily on the ground take every advantage of opportunity; but I hope to see several retire to better business after next November. Notwithstanding the change in affairs by residing in this free air: there is still a prevailing voice in Congress in support of Continental measures. Some gentlemen seem disposed either by their presence, or absence to retard business 'till Congress shall return to Philadelphia. There is no possibility of a vote for returning before all the States South of Delawar river shall be present--or 'till the permanent residence shall be established. I may be mistaken but I expect, we shall stay here through the winter.  Many dispatches were received by the Washington but I am not at Liberty to communicate their contents.  An attack has been made on Commutation: but to no effect, Congress seeming resolved to abide by what they \""have written\"" as was said of old.   3. O'Clock. P.M. This day has been spent in a Comee of the whole House on the jurisdiction necessary for Congress over the place of their permanent residence.(6) It is said that Tyrants make a small circle about them[selves] for their own Security: & I am sorry, that a Confederation of republics should apprehend a necessity of enslaving a small circle about their Supreme Council for its safety. Nothing done.  Col. Wm. Peck passed thro' this day to Philadelphia. I want much to hear from you--pray write me a long old-fashioned Letter on politics, &c. &c.  The Dutch Minister has not had his Audience with Congress, nor arrived as we know of--notwithstanding the reports. In a Letter from Mr Jay dated 22 April--He says that it will perhaps be our policy to do nothing in regard to the refugees 'till after N. York shall be evacuated--and then to receive all but \""the perfidious & the cruel.\""(7) Quare, How many will finally be excluded by his rule?  I was pleased on reading over one of Mr. John Adams's Letters to Congress, dated soon after his arrival at Paris & his great Success in Holland in procuring loans & a Treaty of Amity & commerce. He mentions a variety of Compliments paid him by the Parisians; and among others the following \""Vous ete le Washington de la negotiation.\"" \""You are the Washington of negotiations.\""(8) This was allowed to be the highest pitch. And it occurred to me that I had a good authority for having in former Letters spoken freely of myself. When persons are elevated to high Stations they are apt to become vain. It is a general fault of human nature & while our enemies are severe one expects candour & forgiveness from friends.  I must refer you to a late Letter to Commodore Hopkins(9) for an account of the Success of our foreign Loans.  I should have written to Dr Arnold by this post; had he not written me that he was going to Vermont about this time. Should he not be gone pray shew him this letter. You will also please to shew it to his Honor the Deputy Gov. & to other friends as prudence may direct.  I have recd a Letter from President Manning to which I have not time to reply by this post.(10) He wants to know when I propose to return & whether I would undertake in the College in his place, in case he goes to Europe? I cannot at present answer either of these questions. It is my wish to do some service to the State before I return--little has yet been done; nor is it to be expected that much will be done 'till winter.  I am very glad to hear that Mr John Brown has undertook to furnish the College with a Library & Apparatus.(11) I shall send on a Catalogue of books, &c. as soon as I can.  Please to give my kind regards to Mrs Brown & to all friends & believe me to be as heretofore, Dear Sir, your assured friend & very hble Servt. David Howell SEPTEMBER 25, 1784  ""

  Dear Sir Princeton Sept. 25 1783. Yesterday Mr Pierce the Paymaster to the Army received 332.24 Dollars, a Part of which I proposed to him to receive & draw an Order on your Excellency for the same: he was very willing to let me take the whole (without dividing the Sum) which I have done and drawn an Order on your Excellency in his favour for that Sum,(1) which I request you will advance on Account of my Attendance in Congress the Present year.

By those Proceedings the House will perceive the Obstacles to a Compliance with their Wishes.(1) The Committee on Indian Affairs have made a Report which is now before Congress & this Day is appointed for its Disscussion. The Principles of that Report militate against the Ideas of the House with Respect to the proposed Purchase.(2) It is intended to insist as Part of the Terms of Peace that the Savages should without Compensation abandon Part of their Country to the United States who claim it by Conquest & as a Retribution for the Expence & Damages incurred by the hostile & cruel Conduct of the Savages contrary to the Advice & Injunctions of the United States. A Boundary Line is proposed to be established between the Indians & the Citizens of these States & it was believed that if any particular State made a Purchase it would obstruct the general Measures, as the Indians would not agree to the Dereliction of any Part of their Country as a Compensation for the Expenses & Ravages occasioned by the War when they find that tho' the general Council refuse it they can obtain Money for it from the Individual States. Whether these Principles be just or the Policy advisable we do not pretend to determine.

  Sir, Princeton Sept. 26th. 1783  Near six Monthes have expired since we had the pleasure of informing you that the preliminary articles of peace were signed and that hostilities had ceased with great Britain.(1) From that hour our Ministers have not been able to make any progress in their negotiations with the British Ministers. Perhaps you will be surprized when we say that we suffer under this misfortune by the sole conduct of our own Citizens. Great Britain having lost the subjection of the States was anxious beyond measure to prevent our trade from falling into the hands of the french and Dutch. She knew that by commanding our trade she would ever hold us in some kind of subserviance and would continue to reap the profits of our labour. She then courted our affections and offered to meet us on terms of perfect reciprocity. But the British ministry, who had formed the preliminaries of a general peace, were thrown out of place and two months had passed before a new admin- SEPTEMBER 26, 1783  istration was formed. In this interval the definitive Treaty could not go on, and unfortunately during this time the cause of anxiety and fear on the part of the British was fully removed: Our ports were opened to every thing that was called british, and our vessels, regardless of treaties & despising seizures or forfeitures crouded into the British Ports in a manner that was astonishing to all Europe. It would seem that such people had been humbled by correction and that they loved Great Britain more than other nations; because she treated them worse than slaves, or beasts of burthen, for no Man willingly destroys his slave. The consequence was, that the terms first offered were refused & proclamations have been issued, the copy of which we enclose No. 1, 2. by these you see, that we are to have no trade with the West Indies & very little with Great-Britain itself except to import their goods.(2) During this interval Congress have had a very difficult part to act. While there was no definitive Treaty, and the British forces held one of our chief Cities & several posts in our Country, we could not possibly disband our whole army and leave all our Military stores in their power. Unable however, to borrow money abroad and the States beginning to make more scanty remittances into the Treasury than the small sums they had formerly contributed, it was impossible for us to feed our army, much less continue to feed the British prisoners. We began therefore by giving up the prisoners on their giving up our people who were in their hands. The merchants of Philadelphia, through the Delegates of that State, urged us with indecent importunity, by some act of Congress to countenance the opening of our Ports. By a Law of Pennsylvania trade with great Britain was interdicted during the war; and a declaration of Congress that the war had terminated would restore the trade. Whether it was that the Southern States having suffered more by British cruelty had less confidence in British faith, or whatever might be the cause, the measure was first opposed by these states and Congress have uniformly refused to use any other term in their public acts than cessation of hostilities. The Merchants however, getting no satisfactory answer from Congress, applyed to the Judges, on whose opinion Vessels were permitted to enter from and clear for any British port: other states found other excuses for opening their ports and the disease soon became general.  Our Troops who had been enlisted during the war became uneasy under the same plea of the war being at an end; that argument however, was got over without much trouble, but an argument remained, which we could not answer. They must eat and we could not feed them: nor could they be discharged without money. This was a crisis truly alarming: in the address of Congress to the States you have an account of a dangerous sedition, and in our letter of the first of Au-  gust, on the subject of the mutiny at Philadelphia, we have explained some of the subsequent troubles. Congress could only give one months pay in money to the army & three months pay in Notes by anticipation. Had we kept the whole body a few weeks longer in the field we could not have given them a shilling & perhaps might have seen them demanding justice from their Countrymen at the point of the bayonet. They had been told that the faithful veterans, who had fought & conquered in defence of their Country, would find no reward for their valour nor even a scanty subsistance for their families, and that the glorious war they had supported, would consign them to ruin. An attempt to disband them without some money, and the attempts to establish funds for after payment would have induced them to credit those assertions. The troops enlisted for the war were furloughed to be discharged whenever the definitive Treaty should arrive. They will probably be discharged soon, whether it arrives or not. Thus we have reduced our forces to little more than a garrison for West point & have been obliged to sell ships, Blankets & sundry other articles provided for the army in order to raise money to discharge the contingent expences.  Whenever the definitive treaty does arrive, there is not the least reason to believe that it will contain a single explanation or provision more than is contained in the preliminary articles. If we have been obliged to reduce our army while an armed force held possession of part of our Country it was because some of the States refused to agree to the 5 Per Cent impost and many of the States paid nothing or very little into the Treasury by active Taxation. If we have been prevented from making any commercial stipulations with Great Britain it is because the Merchants without system or caution rushed into the British ports & courted an intercourse with that Country. It is hardly necessary after this remark to point a palpable defect in the fOEderal Government. Congress have the power of making Treaties, but have no power of restraining commerce so as to cause those Treaties to be observed. Had they possessed the mere negative upon imposts, Had they been able to check that entemperate desire of farthings, by which the United States have lost five times as many pounds there would not have been a single British Soldier at this hour in the United States, and we should have enjoyed an honorable & profitable commerce. Situated as we are, a Nation lately violently inimical to us enjoys all the advantages of our commerce without any Treaty without its being advantageous to us, and without our being able to check it. This matter we hope will be taken up by Congress & represented to the States with a plan for remedying it.  We have mentioned the address of Congress to the States which passed in April last.(3) We had forwarded Several copies of this address some months ago & the Pamphlet being reprinted we have lately for  warded one hundred & forty more Copies for the use of the Members of the general Assembly which we presume have come to hand. We flatter ourselves that no arguments, in addition to those used by Congress, will be needed to induce the General Assembly to adopt the measures theirin recommended. The pride of every Citizen must be hurt when he looks over the accounts of payment No. 3(4) which have been made into the public Treasury for the support of the War and of civil Government, and finds that North Carolina is one of the few States that has not contributed a farthing. If she had formerly refused to pass the 5 Per Cent duty it would have been said that she not only paid nothing herself, but was the means of defeating a system by which other states would have paid large sums. Happily this blame fell on Rhode Island though Georgia had not cleared herself of suspicions. The most weighty objections raised by Rhode Island are removed by the plan which is now proposed, but we have strong reasons for thinking that that State will invent new objections; because having little territory & being a carrying State, their desire is to convert the duties on imposts to their own use. We observe that the Delegates from that State are very attentive to the Conduct of the Legislatures of other States, in hopes, we presume, that some of them may share with them the blame of effecting national bankrupcy or some other such calamity. Whatever force there may be in arguments drawn from the general good, which in our state have ever been listened to with great attention, we shall take the liberty of subjoining an argument drawn from the particular interest of the State.  It is not to be disputed that our State is in great Danger of being impoverished & ruined unless a general impost such as the one proposed should take place. For if we fail in the fOEderal impost or a duty laid on for the general use and for the payment of the public debt, each State in the Union will immediately impose a duty for its own particular use. Massachusets who imports for herself & New Hamshire would be pleased with the measure. The same argument applies to Rhode Island, New York, Pennsylvania & Deleware; and the measure would be ruinous to New Hampshire, Connecticut and New Jersey. It is hardly necessary to say that Virginia [and] South Carolina imports for near half for our State. Hence it will follow that all the goods we consume will be loaded with the addition of 5 per cent in their price, the whole of which must go towards paying the taxes of Virginia or South Carolina. We observe that neither of these States are very solicitous about the imposts becomeing general. The reason is too plain, They know without it they can lay a duty for State purposes & that we, having very little foreign trade, shall become their prey.  On the 25th of October 1782 the delegates had the honor of informing your Excellency that the old continental money was become a subject of serious debate in Congress. Some States Massachusets in   particular have collected their full quota of that money and there are large sums still in the hands of their Citizens for which they desire to be creditted at the rate of 40 for one, we are told that it would be difficult perhaps impracticable to collect taxes in that State, where there is a ballance of 47 millions of such Dollars, unless the holders obtain a value for Them. The Delegates uncertain [what steps](5) might be taken on that subject & fearing that the State of North Carolina might finally have to pay in some manner her quota of that money, requested that you would be so good as cause the different Treasurers to account for the sums they had received of the old Continental money, in order that our state might be credited for the same. Certainly large sums of that money were collected by taxation in the beginning of the Year 1782 but we do not learn that any account has ever been taken of the sum. When the delegates are asked what the State has done on this head, we are obliged to answer, as in all other cases where we are interogated concerning money matters or Public accounts, that we are absolutely without information. Merely for the want of such information we have been obliged to negative every question that has been put on the subject of Continental money. Having mentioned Public accounts, we have to intreat that all possible aid may be given the Comptroller to enable him to perfect them, and wipe off the reproach of our State on that subject. The reputation of the State & certainly their interest requires that all public accounts be settled as soon as possible, while facts are recent, while the exertions & suffering of North Carolina are remembered by all the States difficulties may be more easily solved & justice the more easily obtained.  Excepting the Law for opening the land office and emitting some money we are altogether uninformed respecting the Laws passed at the last Session of the General Assembly. We have not heard whether the Resolves of the Assembly or even the Laws have been printed nor do we hear that the art of printing is in the State unless for the purpose of making money. This we mention because applications have been made to us by several printers to recommend them to be employed to print for the State. One of them is an excellent workman & extremely diligent. He is willing to print any thing for you as reasonable as it is done in Philadelphia where there are so many rivals underbidding one another. If the State had not a printer, and has any intention to reprint the Laws that are in force or even to print the future laws & resolves correctly & punctually and wish to employ a workman for that purpose: we can recommend one who is able & courts the honor of that service.  You doubtless recollect that though the confederation was agreed to in Congress on the 15th November 1777 it was not finally ratified by all the States before the 1st of March 1781 at which time Maryland   ratified under a solemn protest. Her objections were that some States should claim & possess vast tracts of vacant unappropriated lands, protected & rescued from the Crown of Great Britain by the joint efforts of the United States should become a fund for the payment of the national debt. In order to induce Maryland & other States who had no vacant territory to accede to the confederation, Congress long since called on the States, who claimed vacant Lands, to make liberal cessions of the same to the United States. On the 29th February 1780 the State of New York & on the 2d January 1781 the State of Virginia made a cession of part of their respective claims, neither of the cessions were very acceptable to the States who had no western territory. However on the 29th October 1782 Congress, pressed by the alarming state of public credit, accepted the cession of New York & on the 13th Instant the[y] accepted the Virginia cession, under certain limitations No. 4.(6) Few of the States are reconciled to the Virginia cession. They argue that she ought to have given more or she ought to have given it less encumbred, but necessity compelled an acceptance. Our army is extremely impatient to obtain the lands that were promised them, and without the Virginia cession we had nothing to give, for tho New York claimed & ceeded the greatest part of the lands between the River Ohio & the lakes as belonging or having belonged to the six nations or their Tributaries; the State of Virginia also claimed the whole of those lands under the shadow of some old Royal Grant. Congress being possessed of both claims may be enabled to pay of[f] the army & perhaps a considerable part of the national debt.  The Eyes of every State to the Northward are now turned towards the Carolinas & Georgia & expecting from them liberal Cessions. The Delegates not informed whether your reserved Lands were for your Officers & Soldiers only or for the army at large or whether the office is now opened for sale of all lands on this side the Mississippi as far South as the Southern boundary of the State, have not been able to give any satisfactory information respecting the matter. At present however, laying aside the justness of their claims, and our refusal to make a cession of part of ours: we are necessitated to declare that, the blame lies on Congress for having so long neglected to take up & determine on the Virginia cession; as they thereby, impressed North Carolina firmly with a belief that their pretended earnest recommendations to the States to make liberal Sessions, was only meant to give time to the land-jobbing to engross all the unappropriated western Territory; to prevent which, & in justice to our numerous creditors, it became absolutely proper as well as politic for us to open our land office: and that it is probable our State may have gone so far as to put it out of their power, however well inclined they may be, to make a cession worth the acceptance of Congress.   You may readily imagine that we are not a little embarrassed; we have accepted the cessions of two States from which it is expected North Carolina will receive advantages equally with the other States, and altho we have an extensive western territory we have not ceded any. Our State we believe is in width one degree and an half; the one degree belonged to the late Earl of Granville & it cannot be doubted we had a right to confiscate his property; This we may sell & the United States cannot claim it, as heirs to the King of Great Britain, (if we may so express it), nor can they desire us to give it up, more than we desire Pennsylvania or Maryland to give up the Lands confiscated in those States that did belong to the proprietors or other subjects of Great Britain. As for the remaining half a degree, it may seem to be in the same condition with the vacant Lands in other States and if North Carolina should reserve two hundred miles long of it, more or less, on the western & Southern boundary to be ceded hereafter to the United States, on certain conditions, perhaps she might prevent many complaints & fair more by the Conditions than the land will ever bring her.  We are not able to determine when the British forces will be withdrawn from the United States. The general in Canada has informed our general, that he has not received any orders on this head: and from New York we have not any thing since our last. We have the honor to be &c &c Benjamin Hawkins  Hugh Williamson ""

Sept. 1783  Your polite favor of the 12th instant reached me a few days since.(1)  The conduct of your people not only gives us great pain, but threatens greatly to involve us in another War.(2) Indeed, my dear Sir, I am suspicious our troubles are not yet at an end.

Your Judges know the preliminary Articles as well as ever they will, and altho' as Lawyers they cannot regard them, yet surely in every point of view they would be justified in not doing any thing in opposition to them, when nothing is necessary to accomplish this end but delay. However they must and will judge for themselves, but they will most certainly repent it at all events.  Our last letter from Mr. Laurence was dated the 9th of August, and from the whole of his intelligence I believe that the preliminary articles in hOEc verba, will form the definitive Treaty at last.(3) The English Ministry press for a Resident at St. James from America.

  Sir, Princeton September 27th. 1783 I have not had the pleasure of any of your Excellencies favours since the 12th July. I observed to you that I should have no objections to be put into the present delegation & to continue at Congress til the Gentlemen appointed should be able to come forward with conveniency to themselves. I did not then expect that I should be obliged to continue so long as I must necessarily be, and above all without any support from the State.  I have for some time been absolutely without as much money as will support me one day except what I borrow and perhaps may not be enabled to repay. Surely it can never comport with the dignity of a sovereign State, to let their delegates depend on such humiliating & precarious means for support. How long we could be supported in our own State on a resolution allowing us two hundred dollars Per Month, without the money I know not: but of this we are certain no money can be raised here on such security.  We have this day some Letters from Mr Laurens at London of the 9th of August:(1) He has had a conference with the British Ministers respecting the commercial Treaty they formerly proposed to our ministers. They informed him that the proclamation we have sent you,(2) was designedly calculated to prevent our trade to their West India islands. They expressed a strong desire to have an american Minister there, and observed that with one all difficulties would be immediately re- SEPEMBER 27, 1783  moved, and a commercial treaty, and every thing else adjusted to the mutual satisfaction of both Countries. Lieutenant Sullivan & Captain Carbery the principles in the mutiny at Philadelphia are at London, they have applied to Mr Laurens, are exceedingly hurt at their Conduct and beg him to intercede for them. They are very anxious to return to America.  We have a communication from Mr. de la Luzerne to this effect from the C de Vergenes of the 21st July.(3) That [it] is difficult to determine when a definitive treaty will be concluded. That France agrees perfectly with England on every point respecting their treaty. That the same may be said of Spain. But that power as well as France attatched to the true principles by which negotiations of such importance ought to be regulated, will not sign but in concert. That Holland had not yet settled her arrangements; but it will be soon done. They have also determined not to sign but in concert. That therefore the negotiations are retarded by nothing but the American Treaty which seems to be in a state of Languor occasioned by the British Plenipotentiary. That it seems that, the Americans by admitting too precipitately English Vessels in their ports have deprived themselves of a powerful Weapon to enduce England to a conclusion of the Treaty. By a continuation of the prohibitory Laws until the final settlement of peace it is probable that they would have furnished the most pungent arms to the party who sincerely wishes that the Treaty with america might be concluded. However the French Court is disposed to believe that it will not be much delayed--That Congress may be assured that the definitive Treaty will not be signed but in conjunction with america.  Mr. Carmichael has written us from Madrid of which the following is an extract which I send you for our Merchants.(4) \""The directors for the supplying of the army and Navy have engaged to give the preference to America for such articles as they may from time to time stand in need of from them, and for this purpose have taken from me the address of Merchantile houses in the different States. I mention this in order that the different members of Congress may be enabled to inform their constituents, who perhaps might chuse to furnish supplies of the produce of the States to which they belong to this Country & who may be able to do it on better terms than the parties I have recommended. The articles most in demand will be masts, spars, Tar, pitch, turpentine, flower, grain, fish &c &c.\"" As most of these articles can only (if furnished from the United States) be furnished from our State, it will certainly be wise in the Legislature to revise the inspection laws, and endeavour by the quality to monopolize this trade. If we should not furnish these articles in perfection, they will certainly go to the Baltic for them, and thereby deprive us of the most valuable branch of our trade.  SEPTEMBER 27, 1783  Be pleased to give my most respectful compliments to the Legislature, assure them of my constant attention to their interest.  With the greatest respect &ca Benj. Hawkins ""

  Dear Sir, Princeton 27 Sept 1783.  Your favor of the 12 Instt. came duly to hand, & is now before me. I am obliged to you for your observations on L. O. certificates & the proposal for issuing new certificates for intrest. It would be advantageous to the public if men of business would take more pains to inform & advise the members of Congress on such subjects as their intrest or opportunities may have made them more particularly acquainted with. It seems to be an assumed principle, which however I must confess is not founded in justice that the public Securities are not to draw compound intrest. It is on this account more necessary to be punctual in the payment of Intrest; & to give every facility to the collection of taxes laid for this purpose. It was earnestly contended that certificates for intrest ought to bear intrest & that compound intrest ought to be allowed in the Consolidation of Securities but I do not expect that these points can be carried.  The difficulties you mention arising from the States having disproportionate quantities of L.O. certificates have been considered & are found to be irremediable. It has been proposed that no State issue more certificates than the amount of its own Quota of the Tax of 4th Sept. 1782. Pennsylvania have paid only such as issued from her own L. Office & are held by such persons as were & are citizens of that State. Persons in this State holding L.O. certificates, which issued from Pennsylvania L. Office, must wait 'till the surplassages from the States remitted to the common Treasury may enable them to receive payment.  If compound intrest is not to be allowed & it be supposeable that the States will not raise the money in due time; it is all one to the holder of L.O. certificates whether he be kept out of his intrest due SEPTEMBER 27, 1783  on an old certificate, or for the intrest thereon--or have a new certificate without intrest. He will receive the Same sum in the event--And if issuing new certificates will facilitate the collection of taxes, it will also hasten the period when he shall receive that Sum--and thus turn to his account; and not only so but these new certificates will enable him to pay his own Quota at least of the Tax for that purpose & those who do not hold securities must purchase them of the holders, or pay the hard money.  The Comee to whom my motion on this Subject was referred have made a report(1)--the report was made agreeably to my motion but after being combatted from the adherents to Continental measures a whole day was finally recommitted. Another report may be soon expected & I hope the measure will at length work its way through the House--It gains by discussion.(2) ................................................................................................ . In consolidating the L.O. certificates Mr. Morris proposes to include the intrest up to the last of 1782 together with the principal. This measure gives much uneasiness--As the intrest has been all along expected to be paid annually--And indeed the public faith has been pledged therefor in the most sacred manner, & I do not see how it can be dispensed with. The army dues also for 1782 are turned over to the funded debt: tho' the estimate, on which the requisition for 8 millions was grounded, expressly included them. It is not difficult to discover the reasons why the expectations of all are to be directed to the funds--Hereby the influence of all is to be engaged in favour of a Continental revenue & in Support of the measures, right or wrong, of the Minister.(3) ................................................................................................ . It is greatly to be desired that a certain rule for apportioning the Quotas to the States was ascertained agreeably to the 8th Art. Confedn. This necessary business is assigned for next March.  Those states which have been deficient in complying with requisitions are for wiping away all past requisitions--And for crediting the States for all payments--in their general account. The reason of Mr. Stelles Queris being doubled--is that he proposed them at different times & the second sett included the first also, & Mr. Morris joined both setts together. I am extremely pleased with the account you have given me of our Commencement(4) & of the revival of the ancient Spirit of our friends in Providence for patronizing the College. That institution has in time past engrossed much of my thoughts & it still has my best wishes. I shall take the first opportunity to obtain & to transmit to you a Catalogue of suitable books &c. You did not inform me whether it was proposed to send for them before a person should go to Europe to solicit donations--or when it was proposed to send some person on that business. Would it not be as well to retain the money raised here & to lay out in  London the money to be collected there for such books, or for such parts of an Apparatus as could not be collected by Specific donations?  I should advise you to lose no time in making application to Congress for compensation of the dammages sustained in the College Edifice. I am by no means sanguine as to the event of such application. I can only say that it would give me pleasure to have the power to urge it forward in my time here--And that an early application cannot prejudice, but will rather strengthen your claims and nothing is to be done here without great deliberation.  As to consulting the Chevalier de la Luzern on the Subject you mentioned--it is at present impracticable as he resides in Philadelphia & it cannot be done by writing. Should he make us a visit & should an occasion offer, I shall do it with pleasure & in such a way as will do no harm. He will probably return soon to France--as it is reported that the Marquis de la Fayette is coming over to relieve him. In that case I shall at all events see & converse with him on the Subject before he departs; & doubt not of his good will & best endeavours. He has always given me marks of his particular regard--as he knows me to be attached to his nation, altho against the Impost.(5) If it is resolved to make application to G. Britain for donations to the College; Our friends there should be informed of it without loss of time; & every intrest applied to in our favor. I doubt not but valuable donations may be obtained in Books & Apparatus as well as money. I should think too that a direct application to the French Court & to the pious Hugonots in France would be adviseable. Perhaps something too might be done in Holland. Rhode Island as a Commercial State would be as likely to obtain favour in Europe as any in the Union. And the Catholic principles on which our College is founded will safely warrant an application with prospect of Success to the charitable & well-disposed of all Sects & nations as occasion may offer. I cannot imagine that Mr Wheelock will derive great advantage from going so early. It takes some time to asswage the animosities of war & to bring forth those humane & benevolent dispositions on which the success of this business so much depends. The definitive Treaty was not signed by the latest accounts. I should think another year as good as this--but as you all seem flushed with great hopes from the present juncture; I shall not throw cold water on your zeal. I believe the present a good time to solicit donations in this Country & hope no stone will be left unturned.  You inform me that, since Mr. Rogers has given out, Mr. Manning thinks of going to Europe himself(6)--and that a difficulty of Supplying his place at the College has again occurred. I told you my mind on those Subjects very fully last winter. I think Mr. Manning of great importance to the Institution at present. If he does not possess all the great qualities desireable, he possesses more of the amiable & useful  accomplishments than any one man I can think of. The great men in England will look for rare learning & most perfect sermons from a President of our College; I will not suggest that they will not be disposed to make allowances for the difficulties with which our President has had to conflict. I consider there is also risque of life in such an undertaking.  The business of solicitation in England would be laborious--It would require great industry & activity, or the necessary expenses would be too great a deduction. I am well assured that no man would have greater zeal than Mr Manning--& perhaps on many accounts he would succeed best. You know my endeavours to serve the College have not been wanting. I have devoted the early part of my life to its service. I now find myself without any professional mode of obtaining a living for my family. It is high time for me to enter into business of some kind for life. If I think of farming I must remove to the new Counties & purchase a large tract. That will not please all my family. Trade I am much unacquainted with--and I know not of any friend who would lead me forward in it. The Law I have had many thoughts about undertaking--but am not yet reconciled to lead myself into so great temptation.(7) For many years I hoped to see a professorship established on a good foundation in our College; which I might have considered as a business & provision for life: But I am disappointed & my hopes from that quarter entirely blasted. I cannot reconcile myself to the Idea of losing any more time by supplying the place of a teacher in the College. It would require all my time. And considering that the business would chiefly rest on me--It would require a more laborious review of all my former studies. Add to this that it is not in the power of the College to make me an adequate compensation for the disadvantage it might be to me.  Was the proposal to take a place for a length of time as a teacher in the College with a suitable provision--In my present circumstances it would meet with a favorable consideration. I never expect to find any business so agreeable to me as teaching philosophy, &c. But I am not in a Situation to consult my own inclination. I must be influenced by private as well as by public motives. Had I a sufficient fortune I should not think of any business but teaching. I am now engaged in opposing a System of Aristocracy already framed & partly executed which will eventually, if not defeated, subvert the Liberties of this Country. I have great hopes of succeeding. You may perhaps think me vain, but I assure you I should not leave this Country but with the utmost reluctance before there should be a comfortable prospect of preserving our present free constitutions. I know not when I shall be recalled. All my endeavours will be again frustrated. Altho' I have need enough of money, yet I can say with great truth that I neither came here; nor   wish to stay for money. I have no earthly prize equal to the Liberties of my Country.  I am willing that others, who are better able than myself, should judge of my abilities--And therefore on my return home propose to be pretty much governed by the voice of my friends in regard to any of the proposals in your Letter. With respect I am &c. David Howell  ""

  Dear Sir, Princeton 27 Sept. 1783. Your favor of the 13th Instant came duly to hand & is before me. You wish to hear the result in regard to the examination. I have reason to believe that the remonstrance expected was made & had its effect. I attended the examination--went in & took a seat before the Dr. came in. After he came in he went to the class, who gathered round him in the further side--after he gave them a few words they sat down & their countenances were evidently more composed. After all that had passed betwixt Dr. S. as well as Dr. W.(1) & myself in regard to my attending the examination & the right of Alumni of the College to examine--the compliment was not paid to me by either of the learned Doctors.  They were however well examined & appeared to have made good proficiency in learning.  SEPTEMBER 27, 1783  I have written Mr. N. Brown concerning the late Commencement here(2) to whom & to the public papers I must refer you on that head. I am charmed with the account you give of your late Commencement & of the Encomiums bestowed by all ranks on the performances of the day. But what more particularly pleases me is that £700 has been raised to procure an Apparatus & Library. These are much wanted--Indeed the very name of having them has a great influence in collecting Scholars. Many hundreds I doubt not have been sent to Cambridge College on account of their famous Library & curious Philosophical Apparatus, who have left the College without soiling the books or profiting much by Experiments in the Philosophy chamber.  I am happy also to find that persons have been appointed to solicit donations to the College, in the particular States. I think there is no time to spare in this business. Our friends here have money as flush now as they may be expected to have it soon. And as the Spirit of encouraging the College has revived among its closest friends I hope it will spread & that something will be done in every State. After all it is my opinion that the fate of the College will ultimately rest on Collections in Europe & in the Town of Providence. This Country is in debt, & what is worse, all seem affrighted at the debt, & to pay taxes with reluctance; these embarrassments afford a ready excuse to those who only wish for one to avoid parting with their money. Yet In fact if we consider the value of our Western territory which contains an Extent of nearly five hundred thousand Square miles & the other resources of this Country our present debt, if we can pay only the intrest for 25 years will be but a mere Baggatelle to the wealth of this Country.  The exertions of our friends in the Town of Providence have already been extraordinary & unequalled in any other instance in this Country. I believe they will yet do more. The Town, I expect, will flourish in Commerce & will of course become populous & wealthy. I consider it of great importance towards collecting money in this Country as well as Europe to have Education going on & the College filling with Students. It is a Proverb with the Italians that \""God helps those who help themselves.\"" A flourishing cause attracts notice & gives hopes of satisfying the wishes of its adherents & promoters.  I consider your presence so necessary to the well being of the College that I fear should you leave the Institution an universal languor & indifference about its intrests would take place--And that the zeal of its best friends, even in Providence, would greatly abate. You have no doubt considered all difficulties in your way. You only mention one to me, Viz, that of procuring a suitable person to take your place in the College. This indeed appears to me an insurmountable one, but not the only one. I know not how the Church & people of your charge could be supplied with a suitable person to fill the pulpit in your absence.   The risque of a voiage to Europe & the casualties of journeying thro' G. Britain--The labour & fatigue of Solicitation--The little affronts & the cool treatment on some occasions--the compliances & degrading submissions on others, are subjects worthy of your consideration before you set off.  You have every reason to believe that your character stands so high in England at present that encreasing fame can be no object to you. If you should exceed their expectations, you must be more than mortal (I had almost said). Should Mr. Rogers, or any other suitable person go to England on this business, I think he could avail himself & benefit the College very much from your character & from your being actually so necessary to the being of the Collige that you could not be spared from home. And the wish to give you immediate relief in your great Embarrassments would draw out many a Guinea in my apprehension.  You mention that Mr. Wheelock(3) is gone already on a similar errand & that it is proposed, or wished to send some person to Europe this fall. I really think that no time can as yet be lost. By our latest accounts the definitive Treaty was not signed. There has for some years been so much ill-blood & spilt-blood betwixt the two Countries that it is not likely to me that the present juncture is above all others favorable for this purpose. I hope no time will be lost in making an application to Congress to compensate the dammages done to the College edifice while occupied by the public. My services shall not be wanting.  The French Minister resides at Philadelphia. I cannot therefore confer with him on the Subject you mention--unless he should visit us, or I him. The first opportunity I shall attend to your request.  I am glad to find that Mr. Gain has begun to collect money for the College. £13 is something.  I hope you will be mistaken in your conjecture that Philadelphia will be our Winters residence. There is no appearance of it at present. The Delegates for Delawar have arrived & the vote of that State cannot be obtained for Philada. before its delegates shall be altered. Georgia has not arrived, & should her delegates with all to the Southward join, as they cannot get a State on this Side Delawar, nor Delawar, they form but six States.  The President of Congress has taken a House in this Town; & here I expect we shall winter. I am glad to hear that Mrs Manning & Mrs Anthony have paid Mrs Howell a visit in my absence. Please to present my best regards to Mrs Manning & to all enquiring friends.  It gives me great pleasure to hear that my Son performed well at the last public speakings. Speaking well is the Unum necessarium in political life. Had I to live my early days over again I would bestow more attention on that important art. I hope my Son will, as he grows older  be more attentive to his learning & in time make a good Scholar. I doubt not of your endeavors.  My desire to serve the College is so great that I am exceedingly embarrassed with your proposal. But on the whole, I cannot think it either for your intrest--that of the Church under your care--or that of the college for you to leave it in its present Situation--provided any other suitable person can be obtained to go to Europe. 18 months or two years absence would be necessary--and much depends on keeping up the Institution at present towards its future prosperity.  With Sentiments of esteem, I am, Dear Sir, your affectionate friend & obedient hble servt, David Howell ""

  Sir, [September ? 1783](1) Having always entertained an esteem for you personally I could not without reluctance yield to impressions that might weaken that sentiment--and it is with pain I find myself drawn by circumstances to animadvert upon the late message from the Executive Council to the Assembly of Pensylvania relative to the mutiny in a manner which may seem to impeach the candor of those who were the authors of it. But it will be impossible for persons who have read the report of the Committee and the message of the Council, however inclined to make allowances for the force of involuntary biass, not to conclude that on one side or the other the facts have been wilfully discoloured. I decline any attempt to set the public opinion right upon this subject, because after all that can be said the judgments of men will eventually be determined by personal and party prepossessions. So far as I am concerned, I persuade myself those who are acquainted with me will place intire confidence in my fairness and veracity. I doubt not Your Excellency's friends will be equally partial to you and those of the council to them. But though I should despair of rectifying or fixing the public opinion by an appeal to the public, and though I have seen too much of the ridicule thrown upon such appeals from men in <<public> official stations, and of the ill effect they have had upon the national charac- SEPTEMBER ?, 1783  ter, not to be willing to sacrifice the desire of justifying myself to considerations of prudence and propriety; yet I cannot forbear indulging my <<sensibility> feelings so far as to enter into a few explanations with Your Excellency, submitting the justness of them to the testimony of your own mind.  As this is a mere private discussion I address myself to your Excellency in particular; and the rather as from the stile and manner of the message, I take it for granted you had the principal agency in it; and I shall consider on the same grounds, the notes in paper of the (2) as a comment on the report of the Committee by yourself, in aid of the message.  I take up the matter individually, because I mean to treat it on a private footing; and because though I do not acknowlege any peculiar responsibility, it happened to be my lot as Chairman principally to conduct the conferences on the part of the Committee.  I regard the whole of this business as a most unfortunate one; in which probably none of the actors will acquire great credit. I deplore it as tending to interrupt the harmony between Congress and a respectable a meritorious member of the Union. Who were right or who were wrong is a question of less importance than how mutual irritations may be best treated? Whatever revives or continues the former is to be regretted. I lament to be under an inducement to discuss circumstances that relate to it in the remotest degree. Nothing but an attack upon the ingenuousness of my conduct could have called me to it. Its prudence either collectively or individually would patiently have been consigned to the lash of censure and cri[ti]cism merited, or unmerited.  Happily in the present case the members of the Committee have a strong ground from which they cannot easily be forced. Apprehensive of misconception, I will not say of misrepresentation, they tried to render it impossible by written documents.(3) The presumption with impartial minds cannot fail to be in favour of that side which gave so decisive a proof of its disposition to fairness as to endeavour to put it out of its own power to misrepresent.  The professed scruples of the Council cannot be admitted to have any weight. Usage and the plainest rules of propriety will dictate that it never could have wounded the dignity or delicacy of the executive of any state, to have given to a Committee of Congress appointed to confer on a subject of moment, a written answer to a request in writing after previous explanations. The fact stated speaks for itself. The consequences show that the precaution of the Committee was well judged and that it would have been well for the Council to have concurred. In the present case it might be observed, that there was in the first instance a written application from Congress to the Council in the customary form of resolutions; and though a Committee was authorised   to confer and explain, a formal and authentic answer might reasonably have been expected by Congress and when desired by the Committee should have been understood as desired on their behalf.  There is an awkwardness in reasoning upon self evident positions; but as the Council have by their conduct in the first instance and by their message since put forward a doubt upon the subject and made it a point of importance, I shall be excused for examining it a little further. On what could the objection of the Council be founded? They say it had been unusual. Admitting the fact, was the mere novelty of the thing a sufficient reason against it? If there was no apparent inconvenience in making a new precedent, if on the contrary there was a manifest convenience in it, ought not such a punctilio to have given way to considerations of utility?  Was it derogatory to the dignity of the Council? Surely if they communicate in writing with the executive servants of Congress, even those in subordinate stations, as is the practice of every day, and as is indispensable to the prosecution of public business, they might at less expence of dignity pursue the same mode with a part of that body itself.  The distinction taken by the Council in their message to the assembly, respecting the responsibility of such executive officers, as not applicable to a Committee,(4) if it amounts to anything, proves only this--that such officers ought in prudence to take greater precautions for their own justification than a Committee of Congress need to do. It is not to be inferred, if a Committee of Congress acting ministerially think it expedient to use circumspection, that those with whom they are transacting business can with propriety refuse to join with them in that mode which is best adapted to precision and certainty.  But indeed the ground of the d[istinction](5) is erroneous. A com- mittee of Congress act in [a] ministerial capacity and are therefore responsi[ble to] the body to which they belong as well as the servants of that body though in a different manner. If it be said they do not act ministerially but stand in the place of Congress, then the Council upon their own principles ought to have complied with their request.  To diminish the exceptionableness of their refusal, it is true, as stated by the Council that though they said they could not condescend to do what the Committee had asked yet they declared themselves to grant an answer in writing, if Congress should request it; and that they proposed that the Committee should put their verbal answer in writing to be afterwards perused and examined by them. The answer of the Committee as I doubt not Your Excellency will recollect was--as to the first point that Congress in all probability would not make the request, having determined (as the Council had been already informed) not to resume their deliberations in the city till effectual measures had been taken to suppress the mutiny--and should they assemble would naturally feel a delicacy in requesting what  had been denied to their Committee. And as to the second point, that the Council having judged it inexpedient to give a written answer, the Committee would content themselves with making the most accurate report in their power, relying upon the confidence of the body to which they belonged and upon the candour of the council.  Your Excellency is too good a judge of human nature as well as of the force of language not to have perceived at the time the effect which the refusal of the Council had upon my mind. I own it struck me either as an uncandid reserve or an unbecoming stateliness; and in either supposition a disrespect to the body of which the Committee were members.  Though nothing enters less into my temper than an inclination to fetter business by punctilio, after the Council had discovered, such <<misplaced> overweening nicety, I should have thought it a degradation to my official character to have consented to their proposal.  The desire of self justification is so natural that I should not have been surprised to have seen the transactions which are the subject of the council's message receive a colouring favourable to their purpose. But I did not expect to find material facts either suppressed or denied.  The report made by the Committee on the first interview with the Council was I acknowlege from memory and therefore I admit a possibility of error; but so far as my memory can be relied on the representation was just. And I am certain that there is a mistake in the insinuation, that the circumstance of the message sent to Congress by the Board of serjeants, was not mentioned at all to the Council, for I have a note of it taken immediately after the first conference subsequent to the mutiny.(6) The affair, by the event of (7) having assumed a more serious aspect I kept a regular minute of the proceedings a summary of which made up our report to Congress and which I shall annex at large to this letter for your Excellency's perusal. The message intirely omits the declaration of the Council that [...](8) and the note says, that the Council only declared, \""that they could not be sure, that such another insult would produce those exertions.\""(9) The difference in this article is of great importance. The declaration made so deep an impression at the time, that almost the precise words remained in my memory. They were twice repeated as well when we saw Your Excellency alone in your own house in the morning, as when you delivered to us in the Council chamber the determination of the Council. Mr. Elseworth in half an hour afterwards repeated them to several members of Congress assembled at the Presidents house, and in a few hours from that time I committed them to writing. I cannot suppose Your Excellency's recollection fails you in this particular and I must pointedly appeal to your candour.  To show the inaccuracy with which the report of the Committee was composed--it is observed in the notes with respect to that part which   relates to the commission given by the mutineers to the officers, whom they had chosen to represent them, that only two hours intervened between that event and the conference with the Council--and that it was very improbable the knowlege of it could have so early reached the Committee. It is added that none of the Council remembers to have heard a single syllable respecting it during the whole conference.(10)  As to the argument drawn from the short interval between the delivery of the commission and the conferrence, it will be sufficient to say that the Committee held a constant communication with General St Clair and that he kept a vigilant eye upon all the motions of the mutineers--that his access to them was easy--that the fact in question was a matter of immediate notoriety--that two hours were abundant time for a thing of that nature to be conveyed from the barracks to General St Clairs quarters and that one of the Committee had actually seen and obtained the intelligence from him, a little time before the interview with the Council commenced. It is much more extraordinary that the Council should have been apprized of it so late than that the Committee should have known it so early. As to the memory of the Council it is unfortunate it should have been so fallible as it is said to have been; but I would rather suppose in the quick succession of circumstances, the matter had escaped their recollection than that my minutes as well as my memory should have deceived me. I will recollect also that Your Excellency when it was mentioned acknowleged that it rather contradicted the pacific appearance which the conduct of the troops in other respects wore.  These are the essential differences in point of fact between the report of the Committee and the message of council--the whole complexion indeed of the one materially varies from the other, but the most common observer must have noticed how different an aspect the same facts will bear differently dressed and arranged. It was to avoid this we proposed to reduce them to writing; but as this has not been done, spectators must judge from the situation of the parties and the course of the transactions which side has given the justest relation.  I cannot however forbear remarking that I see expressions of civility on the part of the Committee making a figure in the message very different from their genuine intention; being introduced in a manner that gives them the air of concessions in favour of the conduct of the Council. Your Excellency will certainly recollect that the Committee were very remote from a concurrence in sentiment with the Council; and though they did not presume to judge of the disposition of the citizens strongly urged the expedience and necessity of calling out the Militia and facility of employing them with success against an unofficered and disorderly body of mutinous soldiers. It is true also that they acknowleged the candour with which the Council exposed to them what they deemed the temper of their citi[zens] and their own   difficulties and embarrassments which were no doubt delineated with great energy of language and display of circumstances--but they certainly never admitted the candour of refusing an answer in writing which was a part of the business transacted with the Council; nor did they withdraw without giving an intelligible intimation of their sense of this proceeding.  I was also surprised to see any part of the private and confidential conversation I had with your Excellency ushered into the message from the council and moulded into such a shape as to imply by an obvious construction an approbation of their reasons. Your Excellency will admit the following state of this transaction to be a just one.  I waited upon the Council to correct a piece of information I had given them respecting ammunition; but even this is mistated, as will be seen by my minutes.(11) Having done this my official business ended when I was taken aside by Your Excellency and a conversation passed in declared confidence. You informed me that a meeting of the Militia officers was then holding and in consultation with the Council about eventual measures (in consequence as I conjectured of a communication to you the preceding evening from the delegates of the state of the intention of Congress to remove from the city in case they did not receive satisfactory assurances of support) you added that you hoped nothing would be precipitated; but that proper allowances would be made for the situation of the Council.  I understood your observation, with reference to the departure of Congress, and replied to this effect--that I viewed the departure of Congress as a delicate measure, including consequences important to the national character abroad and critical with respect to the state of Pensylvania and in particular the city of Philadelphia--that the triumph of a handful of mutinous soldiers permitted in a place which is considered as the capital of America to surround and in fact imprison Congress without the least effort on the part of the citizens to uphold their dignity and authority, so as to oblige them to move from the place which had been their residence during the revolution, would it was to be feared be viewed at a distance as a general disaffection of the citizens to the fOEderal government, might discredit its negotiations and affect the national interests--that at home it might give a deep wound to the reputation of Pensylvania might draw upon it the resentments of the other states and sow discord between Congress and the state. That the removal of Congress would probably bring the affair to a crisis and by convincing the mutineers that extremities were intended, would either intimidate them into a submission or determine them to immediate excesses--that impressed with these considerations, and still hoping, notwithstanding some appearances to the contrary, that the mutineers might be sincere in their professions of submission, or that the Council on further examination would find it  in their power to act with vigour, I had declined giving my assent to a report in writing which would necessarily be followed by the departure of Congress--that though the Committee had no discretion by the powers under which they acted, but were bound by the tenor of their instructions, the moment they did not receive, \""satisfactory assurances of prompt and adequate exertions on the part of the state for supporting the public authority\"" to advise the adjournment of Congress to Trenton or Princeton--and I therefore considered the delay of this advice as at their extreme peril, yet, as to myself, I should persist in it 'till the result of the present consultation with the Militia officers or 'till some new circumstance should turn up to explain the designs of the mutineers--that in persuing this line of conduct, I should counteract the sense of some Gentlemen whose feelings upon the occasion were keen and the opinions of others who thought the situation of Congress under the existing circumstances extremely awkward precarious and unjustifiable to their constituents. Your Excellency approved my intention--wished for time and promised if any new resolution should be taken to give me immediate notice of it.  The Meeting of the Militia officers dissolved. I heard nothing from Your Excellency. General St Clair about two in the afternoon informed the Committee that the officers appointed by the Soldiers to manage their business had in the first instance refused to give him an account of their transactions--which was only extracted from them by a peremptory demand. He mentioned to us the instructions they had received from the soldiers which contained faint and affected concessions mixed with new and inadmissible <<demands> claims. The whole affair wore the complexion of collusion between the officers of the Committee and the soldiery and of a mere amusement on their part 'till they good [could] gain fresh strength and execute their project whatever it might be with greater advantage.  This behaviour of the officers gave the affair a new and more serious aspect and overcame my opposition to the report. Mr. Peters on hearing the relation of General St Clair declared at once that he thought the Committee had then no alternative; at least what he said was understood in this sense by General St Clair, Mr Elseworth and myself. If I am not much mistaken General St Clair also expressed his opinion that Congress were unsafe in the city.  The ideas I suggested to Your Excellency in the conversation I have mentioned, were substantially expressed to several members of Congress as the motives of my delay--and particularly I recollect to Mr. Maddison, with these observations in addition. That though I was fully convinced Congress under an immediate view of circumstances, would in reality be justified in withdrawing from a place where such an outrage to government had been with impunity perpetrated by a  body of armed mutineers, still for several days in complete command of the city and where either the feebleness of public councils or the indisposition of the citizens afforded no assurance of protection and support; yet as the opinions of men would be governed by events, and as the most probable event was that the removal of Congress, announcing decisive measures of coertion to the soldiery would awe them into submission, there was great danger that the reputation of Congress would suffer by the easy termination of the business, and that they would be accused of levity, timidity or rashness.  Though not within the scope of my original intention I will indulge a few additional reflections on this subject.  I am sensible, that the Council in some respects stand upon advantageous ground in this discussion. Congress left the city because they had no forces at hand, no jurisdiction over the Militia and no assurances of effectual support from those who had. The Council, as the Executive of the state, were necessitated to remain on the spot. Soon after Congress removed, the Mutineers were deserted by their leaders and surrendered at discretion.  The Multitude will be very apt to conclude that the affair was of triffling consequence--that it vanished under its own insignificance-- that Congress took up the matter in too high a tone of authority--that they discovered a prudish nicety and irritability about their own dignity--that the Council were more temperate more humane and possessed of greater foresight.  The byass in favour of an injured army--the propensity of the human mind to lean to the speciousness of professed humanity rather than to the necessary harshness of authority--the vague and imper- fect notions of what is due to public authority in an infant popular government--and the insinuating plausibility of a well constructed message will all contribute to that conclusion.  But let us suppose an impartial man of sense well acquainted with facts to form an argument upon the subject. It appears to me he might naturally fall into this train of combination.  It is a well known fact that from the necessities of the war or the delinquencies of the several states Congress were not enabled to comply with their engagements to the army, which after a glorious and successful struggle for their country, much suffering, exemplary patience and signal desert, they were compelled by the irresistible dictates of an empty treasury and a ruined credit to disband, after having given strong indications of their discontent and resentment of the public neglect. A large part of the army suffer themselves to be patiently dismissed; a particular corps of four or five hundred men stationed in the place where Congress reside, refuse to accept their discharges but on certain specified conditions. They even go further and stimulated by their injuries, or encouraged and misled by designing  persons are emboldened to send a threatening message to Congress declaring to them that unless they would do them justice immediately, they would find means of redress for themselves. Measures are indirectly taken to appease this disorder and give the discontented soldiers as much satisfaction as the situation of things will permit. Shortly after accounts are received that another corps at (12) miles distance have also mutinied, and that a part of them to the number of about Eighty men are on their march to join those who had already discovered so refractory a disposition. A Committee of Congress is immediately appointed to confer with the Executive of the State on the measures proper to be persued in this exigency. That Committee in the first instance suggests to the Council the expedience of calling out a body of Militia to intercept the detachment of mutineers on its march and represent the danger of the progress of the spirit of mutiny and of future outrages should those on their march be suffered without molestation to join a more numerous corps in the same temper with themselves. The Council urge a variety of difficulties--the shortness of the time to collect the Militia, before the mutineers would arrive--the reluctance with which the citizens would obey a call against men whom they consider as meritorious and injured and the like. The Committee perceiving the unwillingness of the Council to employ the Militia desist from pressing it and recur to expedients. The day after the mutineers march in triumph into the city and unite themselves with those who are already there; and the following day the whole body assemble in arms, throw off all obedience to their officers and in open defiance of government march to the place which is the usual seat of Congress and the Council of the state, while both are actually sitting, surround it with guards and send a message to the council, demanding authority to appoint, themselves, officers to command them, with absolute discretion to take such measures as those officers should think proper to redress their grievances; accompanied with a threat that if there was not a compliance in twenty minutes, they would let in an injured soldiery upon them and abide the consequence. The members of Congress who were at the time assembled request General St Clair, who happened to be present, to take such measures as he should judge expedient without committing the honor of government to divert the storm and induce the troops to return to their quarters without perpetrating any acts of violence. General St Clair in concert with the Council grants the mutineers permission to elect out of officers then or formerly in commission such as they should confide in to represent their grievances to the Council, with a promise that the Council would confer with the persons elected for that purpose. Having obtained this promise the mutineers return to their quarters, in military parade, and continue in open defiance of government.   The concession made was a happy compromise between an attention to dignity and a prudent regard to safety. Men who had dared to carry their insolence to such an extreme and who saw no opposition to their outrages were not to be expected to retreat without an appearance at least of gratifying their demands. The slightest accident was sufficient to prompt men in such a temper and situation to tragical excesses.  But however it might become the delicacy of government not to depart from the promise it had given, it was its duty to provide effectually against a repetition of such outrages and to put itself in a situation to give instead of receiving the law; and to manifest that its compliance was not the effect of necessity but of choice.  This was not to be considered as the disorderly riot of an unarmed mob but as the deliberate mutiny of an incensed soldiery carried to the utmost point of outrage short of assassination. The licentiousness of an army is to be dreaded in every government; but in a republic it is more particularly to be restrained, and when directed against the civil authority to be checked with energy and punished with severity. The merits and sufferings of the troops might be a proper motive for mitigating punishment when it was in the power of the government to inflict it--but it was no reason for relaxing in the measures necessary to arrive at that situation. Its authority was first to be vindicated and then its clemency to be displayed.  The rights of government are as essential to be defended as the rights of individuals. The security of the one is inseparable from that of the other. And indeed in every new government, especially of the popular kind the great danger is that public authority will not be sufficiently respected.  But upon this occasion there were more particular reasons for decision.  Congress knew there were within two or three days march of the city a more considerable body of the same corps part of which had mutinied and come to town and had been the chief actors in the late disorder--that those men had with difficulty been kept by the exertions of their officers from joining the insurgents in the first instance--that there was another corps in their neighbourhood which a little time before had also discovered symptoms of mutiny--that a considerable part of the same line which were in mutiny in town was every moment expected to arrive from the Southward, and there was the greatest reason to conclude would be infected with the same spirit on their arrival, as had presently happened in the case of a small detachment which had joined a few days before--that there were besides large numbers of disbanded soldiers scattered through the country in want and who had not yet had time to settle down to any occupation and exchange their military for private habits--that some of these were really coming in and adding themselves to the revolters--that an   extensive accession of strength might be gained from these different quarters--and that there were all the sympathies of like common distresses and resentments to bring them together and to unite them in one cause. The partial success of those who had already made an experiment would have been a strong encouragement to others--the rather as the whole line had formerly mutinied not only with impunity but with advantage to themselves.  In this state of things decision was most compatible with the safety of the community as well as the dignity of government. Though no general convulsion might be apprehended serious mischiefs might attend the progress of the disorder. Indeed it would have been meanness to have negotiated and temporised with an armed banditti of four or five hundred men--who in any other situation than surrounding a defenceless senate could only become formidable by being feared. This was not an insurrection of a whole people--it was not an army with their officers at their head demanding the justice of their country--either of which might have made caution and concession respectable. It was a handful of mutinous soldiers, who had equally violated the laws of discipline as the rights of public authority.  Congress therefore wisely resolve that \""it is necessary that effectual measures be immediately taken for supporting the public authority\"" and call upon the state in which they reside for the assistance of its militia at the same time that they send orders for the march of a body of regular forces as an eventual resource.  There was a propriety in calling for the aid of the Militia in the first place, for different reasons. Civil government may always with more peculiar propriety resort to the aid of the citizens to repel military insults, or encroachments. Tis there it ought to be supposed where it may seek its surest dependence especially in a democracy, which is the creature of the people. The citizens of each state are in an aggregate light the citizens of the United states and bound as much to support the representatives of the whole as their own immediate representatives. The insult was not to Congress personally it was to the government <<of the Union>, to public authority in general; and was very properly put upon that footing. The regular forces which Congress could command were at a great distance, and could not but in a length of time be brought to effecuate their purpose. The disorder continued to exist on the spot where they were, was likely to increase by delay and might be productive of sudden and mischievous effects by being neglected. The city and the bank were in immediate danger of being rifled and perhaps of suffering other calamities. The citizens therefore were the proper persons to make the first exertion.  The objection that these were not the objects of the care of Congress can only serve to mislead the vulgar. The peace and safety of   the place which was the immediate residence of Congress endangered too by the troops of the United States demanded their interposition. The President of the State of Pensylvania was himself of this opinion having declared to a member of that body that as their troops were the offenders it was proper for them to declare the necessity of calling out the Militia as a previous step to its being done.  Nor is there more weight in the supposition that the danger was inconsiderable and that from the pacific appearances of the troops it was to be expected the disorder would subside of itself. The facts were that the troops still continued in a state of mutiny--had made no submissions--nor offered any--and that they affected to negotiate with their arms in their hands. A band of mutinous soldiers in such a situation uncontrouled and elated [by] their own power was not to be trusted. The most sudden vicissitudes and contradictory changes were to be expected; and a fit of intoxication was sufficient at any moment with men who had already gone such length to make the city a scene of plunder and massacre. It was the height of rashness to leave the city exposed to the bare possibility of such mischiefs.  The only question in this view is--whether there was greater danger to the city in attempting their reduction by force than in endeavouring by palliatives to bring them to a sense of duty. It has been urged and appeared to have operated strongly upon the minds of the Council,(13) that the soldiers being already embodied accustomed to arms and ready to act at a moments warning it would be extremely hazardous to attempt to collect the citizens to subdue them as the mutineers might have taken advantage of the first confusions incident to the measure to do a great deal of mischief before the Militia could have assembled in equal or superior force.  It is not to be denied but that a small body of disciplined troops headed and led by their officers with a plan of conduct could have effected a great deal in similar circumstances; but it is equally certain that nothing can be more contemptible than a body of men used to be commanded and to obey when deprived of the example and direction of their officers. They are infinitely less to be dreaded than an equal number of men who have never been broken to command, nor exchanged their natural courage for that artificial kind which is the effect of discipline and habit. Soldiers transfer their confidence from themselves to their officers, face danger by the force of example, the dread of punishment and the sense of necessity. Take away these inducements and leave them to themselves they are no longer resolute than 'till they are opposed.  In the present case it was to be relied upon that the appearance of opposition would instantly bring the mutineers to a sense of their insignificance and to submission. Conscious of their weakness from the smallness of their numbers--in a populous city and in the midst of a   populous country--awed by the consequences of resisting government by arms, and confounded by the want of proper leaders and proper direction, the common soldiers would have thought of nothing but making their peace by the sacrifice of those who had been the authors of their misconduct.  The idea therefore of coertion was the safest and most prudent, for more was to be apprehended from leaving them to their own passions than from attempting to controul them by force. It will be seen by and by how far the events justly appreciated corresponded with this reasoning.  Congress were not only right in adopting measures of coertion; but they were also right in resolving to change their situation if proper exertions were not made by the particular government and citizens of the place where they resided. The want of such exertions would evince some defect, no matter where, that would prove they ought to have no confidence in their situation. They were to all intents and purposes in the power of a lawless armed banditti enraged whether justly or not against them. However they might have had a right to expose their own persons to insult and outrage, they had no right to expose the character of representative, or the dignity of the states they represented or of the Union. It was plain they could not with propriety in such a state of things proceed in their deliberations where they were and it was right they should repair to a place where they could do it. It was far from impossible that the mutineers might have been induced to seize their persons as hostages for their own security as well as with a hope of extorting concessions. Had such an event taken place the whole country would have exclaimed, why did not Congress withdraw from a place where they found they could not be assured of support--where the government was so feeble or the citizens so indisposed as to suffer three or four hundred mutinous soldiers to violate with impunity the authority of the United States and of their own state?  When they resolved to depart on the want of adequate exertions, they had reason to doubt their being made from the disinclination shown by the Council to call out the militia in the first instance; and when they did actually depart--they were informed by the Council that the efforts of the citizens were not to be looked for even from a repetition of the outrage which had already happened and it was to be doubted what measure of outrage would produce them. They had also convincing proof that the mutiny was more serious than it had even at first appeared by the participation of some of the officers.  To throw the blame of harshness and precipitancy upon Congress it is said that their dignity was only accidentally and undesignedly offended. Much stress has been laid upon the message from the soldiery being directed to the Council and not to them. All this however is very immaterial to the real merits of the question. Whatever might have SPTEMBER ?, 1783  been the first intention of the mutineers in this particular act whether it proceeded from artifice or confusion of ideas, the indignity to Congress was the same. They knew that Congress customarily held their deliberations at the state house; and if it even be admitted that they knew Saturday to be a day of usual recess, which perhaps is not altogether probable, when they came to the place they saw and knew Congress to be assembled there. They did not desist in consequence of this; but proceeded to station their guards and execute their purposes. Members of Congress went out to them--remonstrated with them--represented the danger of their proceedings to themselves and desired them to withdraw, but they persisted until they obtained what they supposed a part of their object. A majority of the same persons had some days before sent a message almost equally exceptionable to Congress; and at the time they scarcely spoke of any other body than Congress; who indeed may naturally be supposed to have been the main object of their resentments: for Congress having always appeared to the soldiery to be [the] body who contracted with them and who had broken faith with them--it is not to be supposed they were capable of investigating the remote causes of the failures so as to transfer the odium from Congress to the state.  But the substantial thing to be considered in this question is the violation of public authority. It cannot be disputed that the mutiny of troops is a violation of that authority to which they owe obedience. This was in the present case aggravated to a high degree of atrociousness by the gross insult to the government of Pensylvania, in the face of Congress and in defiance of their displeasure. It was further aggravated by continuing in that condition for a series of time.  The reasons have been assigned that made it incumbent upon Congress to interpose; and when they called upon the state of Pensylvania not only to vindicate its own rights but to support their authority--the declining a compliance was a breach of the confederation and of the duty which the state of Pensylvania owed to the United States. The best apology for the government of Pensylvania in this case is that they could not command the services of their citizens. But so improper a disposition in the citizens if admitted must operate as an additional justification to Congress in their removal.  The subsequent events justly appreciated illustrate the propriety of their conduct. The mutineers did not make voluntary submissions in consequence of negotiation, persuasion or conviction. They did not submit 'till after Congress had left the city publishing their intentions of coertion, 'till after there had been an actual call upon the Militia--till their leaders and instigators alarmed by the approach of force and the fear of being betrayed by the men fled. They were reduced by coertion not overcome by mildness. It appears too that while they were professing repentance and a return to their duty, they were tampering  with the troops at York Town and Lancaster to increase their strength--and that two officers at least were concerned in the mutiny, who by their letters since, have con[fessed] that some project of importance was in contemplation.  The call for the militia was made the day after it had been pronounced ineligible by the Council. There could have been little change in that time either in the temper or preparation of the citizens. The truth is that the departure of Congress brought the matter to a crisis and that the Council were compelled by necessity to do what they ought to have done before through choice.  It is to be lamented that they did not by an earlier decision, prevent the necessity of Congress taking a step which may have many disagreeable consequences. They then would(14) ""

The Suffrage of the Republic of Letters has contributed to give us a celebrity during the War and this union formed with its Cheifs in various Countries will secure useful Connections to our Ministers, as well as to the American Youth who may travel for Instruction: Should this Idea meet your Approbation, I would take the Liberty of recommending the Count de Campomanes Fiscal of the Council of Castille, The Above mentioned Dr. Gaspar Jove Llanos (2) & the Abbe Gavarra Secretary of the Academy of History (3) &c&.\""  As I have no doubt of the attachment of your learned Society to the Interests of America and their real desire of aiding in every Thing that will advance her reputation & dignity I shall make no Apology for the Liberty I have taken in thus laying before you an Application that may possibly benefit our Comon Country. If you should think proper to take any resolutions in Consequence of this Information, I will forward the result to our Minister at the Court of Spain with great Pleasure.  I have the honor to be with every Sentiment of respect & the most earnest wishes for the increase of experimental Knowledge and the prosperity of your useful & honorable Society.

  Sir, Princeton 1st October 1783  I have the honor, in obedience to the commands of Congress, to enclose to your Excellency the certified copy of an Act of Congress in answer to a letter of the 11th of July I received from the Legislature of your State.(1)  The long delay that has attended this answer has been principally owing to the delicacy and importance of a subject, that, from its own nature, as well as from the respect due to so respectable a Body as the Legislature of Massachusetts, required the most serious deliberation.  It will give us great pleasure to find that honorable Body fully satisfied with our determination on measures that sensibly affect the common interest of the United States.

  Gentlemen Princeton 1st Octr 1783  We had the Honor of addressing You the 11th of September, & of informing You, that a Report was then before Congress, for enabling Massachusetts, & other States in similar Circumstances, to make proposals to their officers for terminating the Disputes respecting half pay & Commutation. The Report has since been considered, & met the Fate We predicted, as will appear by the inclosed proceedings of Congress on the Subject.(1)  OCTOBER 1, 1783  We are unable to determine, whether the Measure, if adopted, would have releived the Legislature from their present Embarassments, but as nothing better could be obtained, We were willing to accept it; & to make it palatable, were under the Necessity of consenting, that a proviso should be inserted, for fulfilling the Engagements of Congress to Officers who might not incline to a Compromise; and also, that the funded Certificates which might be assigned to the State, by officers making a Compromise, should not be received at the Treasury of the united States, in Payment of Requisitions for discharging the Interest of the publick Debtbut notwithstanding these Concessions, the report was rejected, & Congress have assigned their Reasons for not complying with the Desires of the Legislature. The promise of half pay for Life, being made in the Year 1780, was prior to the Existence of the present Congress, or indeed of any Congress \""assembled in pursuance of the Confederation\"", & is therefore considered as being under the Sanction of the 12th Article, which provides \""That all Bills of Credit emitted, Monies borrowed, & Debts contracted by or under the Authority of Congress, before the assembling of the united States, in pursuance of the present Confederation, shall be deemed & considered as a Charge against the united States, for Payment & Satisfaction whereof, the said united States, & the publick Faith are thereby solemnly pledged\"". Congress therefore alledge that the Grant of half pay, was not their Act, nor subject to their Controul--that to deprive the Officers of this Grant, of this Debt due to them, as a Reward for their Services, would be unconstitutional & a direct Violation of the Articles of the Confederation--that the Commutation was conceived to be, & in Fact was an advantageous Contract on the Part of the united States--but admitting it was not, that the Faith of the publick being solemnly pledged for fulfilling that Engagement, can never be recalled--& that even an Attempt to recall it, would sap the Foundation of publick Credit. How far these Measures & observations of Congress are consistent with Reason & good policy; the honorable Legislature may be able to judge: it is incumbent on Us to state the Facts, and to submit the same to their Consideration.  It may be necessary at this Time to inform the Legislature, that the State of Virginia has offered on certain Conditions to cede to the united States, a large Tract of Territory containing upwards of sixteen Million Acres--that Congress have accepted the Cession, with some Variation from the proposed Conditions (2)--that a great Number of officers, in Expectation that Virginia will close with Congress, have applied to the latter for a Grant of part of the Lands, in payment of the funded Certificates issued to the said officers for their Arrearages & Commutation--and that it appears to be the present Intention of Congress, when the Cession is compleat, to apply part of the Lands to the purpose mentioned. Should this plan be carryed into Effect, it   may be worthy of Consideration, whether it would not be more for the Interest of the State, to pay its proportion of the Army Debt by this Mode, than by compromising with the officers, & discharging in Specie, the Arrearages of their pay, Cloathing & Rations, agreable to the original Contract. We mean not however to give a decided Opinion on this important Subject, but submit it to the Wisdom of the honorable Legislature.  With Respect to the old Emissions,(3) nothing further is done for calling them in, neither have We the least Expectation, that the Measures of Congress, relative thereto, will be either satisfactory, or what We conceive equitable to the State. Should the Money be called in by the Legislature, & transmitted to the continental Treasury at 75 for 1, in part Payment of the Requisitions of Congress, some Members who are opposed to an Act of Congress for this purpose have intimated to Us, that they should acquiesce in the Measure; & We are fully of Opinion, that it would finally be submitted to without much opposition. Indeed the Legislature, in this Case, would stand on firm & constitutional Ground; their proceedings would bear the Test of Reason & Justice; & the Opposition of Congress must be condemned by every judicious & impartial Mind. Neither will Massachusetts if We are rightly informed by the Delegates of New Hamshire & Rhode Island stand alone in this Matter, these States being in similar Circumstances. But if the State should be unsupported by others, ought it to be less firm in a Demand of Justice, or in Measures to obtain it? We think not. If her Claims are not just she can have no Desire of succeeding in them; but if they are just, the more they are opposed, the more equitable they will appear, & opposition itself must finally vanish before the stern & irresistable Majesty of Justice.  With Respect to the proceedings of Congress of September 25th, We disapproved of them altogether, & therefore we made no Motions for Amendments; otherwise We should not have passed many parts unnoticed, & particularly that wherein it is asserted that the \""confederated States at the Commencement of the War, leagued to defend the violated Rights of Massachusetts\""(4) when it is known to every person, conversant with the History of the Origin of the War, that the Attempt of the british Ministry to alter the Charter of Massachusetts, alarmed the other Governments, & that they leagued in Defence of the chartered Rights of all the Colonies, each having a particular Regard to its own Safety.  You will please to present our best Respects to the honorable Legislature, & beleive Us to be Gentlemen with perfect Esteem & Respect your most obedt. & most humble serts, E Gerry S. Holten P.S. Our Collegue Mr Higginson, if requested by the honble Court,   will explain to them many Matters not comprized in this letter, or the Inclosures.(5)  ""

  Dr Sir. Princeton October 2d. 1783 I was favored with yours of the 26th of August, by the Hand of the Revd. Dr. Gordon; his request to Congress is now in the hands of a  OCTOBER 2, 1783  Committee to report.(1) I am fully sensible of the Doctors merits as an early espouser of the American cause, nothing therefore shall be wanting in me, which is consistent with my duty to the public, to give effect to his wishes: I should be happy on this, as well as on many other much greater occasions, to have the aid of a Colleague; it is no small mortification to me that your Affairs did not permit you to accept your appointment. I have been so sensible of the importance of a representation from New Hampshire that I have ventured to suggest to the Executive the expediency of calling the Court for that special purpose; I do not however much expect that measure will be adopted.  I take the liberty to enclose extracts of some of the last Letters from our foreign Ministers, signed jointly by them, and which contain their comments on some of the provisional Articles.(2) These I considered as necessary to be communicated to individuals in the State I have the Honr. to represent; but do not wish them, from prudential considerations to be made public, tho at the same time I do not consider them as matters of Secrecy. You will oblige me in communicating them to the Honble. W[oodbur]y Langdon & Genl. Whipple (to whom I have not now time to write) and such others as your prudence will direct. Other material extracts of foreign Letters I shall forward to some of my friends in Portsmouth by the next mail. Our foreign Ministers have received from Congress their ratification of the provisional Articles, but no exchange of ratifications between them & the British, had taken place, when the last accounts were received from Europe.  It does not seem that Mr Carelton and Genl. Hauldiman, are very active in carrying the provisional Articles into effect; I therefore suppose you will conclude, that while they occupy their posts within the United States, and in many instances are counteracting those Articles, it is not our buisness to be over hasty in complying therewith, or to advance by large Steps in our compliance, till we are informed Great Britain hath explicitly ratified them. Genl. Hauldiman has informed Genl. Washington that he has recived no orders from the British Court for any thing more than a cessation of hostilities, & has refused Baron Stuben liberty to visit any of the Posts ceeded to the United States by the provisional Treaty.(3) I am Sir with great esteem & respect your very humble Servant, Abiel Foster ""

  Sir. Princeton October 2d. 1783. This day I endeavourd to bring on the report of a Committee which was read Yesterday, on your Honrs. Letter to the President of Congress on the subject of Loan Office certificates.(1) The order of the day was insisted on which prevented its being taken up, notwithstanding that I pressed the length of time this matter had been before Congress, & my desire to transmit some determination by this Post. The truth is, the Southern States are opposed to the measure, and I much doubt whether any thing will be done thereon by Congress. It is said that New Hampshire is fully competent for the purpose, that Mr. Gilman is Loan Officer in consequence of his appointment by the State, and may be directed to issue the certificates by & under the orders thereof, and that Congress ought not to give countenance to the measure. It is true, that Pensylvania and Jersey, have of their own authority ordered their Loan Officers to issue, and they have complied with the order. But I could rather wish it might be done in the State I have the Honr. to represent under the authority of Congress. However, should the Executive think proper to give order to Mr. Gilman, to liquidate and issue certificates for one years interest, on such certificates as have issued from the Loan Office of the State, in favor of our own citizens, and as are now held by them, I think no great inconvenience could arise therefrom, at least we should be on a footing with Pensylvania. But whatever Step may be taken, as no sufficient reasons have been offered to convince me that any evil would ensue, should Congress interpose in authorising it to be done; in the several lengthy debates thereon; I shall do all in my power on Tuesday next, when it will be the order of the day, to obtain a favorable determination.

  Dear Mr. Webster.(1) Princeton, 2d October. 1783. Your kind attention of the 9th ultimo, I recd. a few days since,  OCTOBER 2, 1783  which gave me sensible pleasure, but what added to it, was your safe return home & tho' you have not mentioned your health, yet may I not conclude it to be better.  The polite reason you are pleased to assign for not writing to me first, wou'd apply very properly to a stranger when writing to a person in my place, but the same formalities are not necessary in the relation you stand in to me.  The accts. I have of your dear little babe is very agreeable.  Last week two of the sergeants that were concerned in the late mutiny, being under sentence of death, were carried to the place of execution, & every formality gone through with, except the final stroke, when a full & general pardon was proclaimed from Congress, not only for these two, but for all that were under sentences, for corporal punishment, on acct. of said mutiny; it can be better concieved of by you than expressed by me, how the poor criminals feel upon so sudden a change in one moment as they supposed they were to lanch into eternity; and the next moment not only set at full liberty, but their offences forgiven; It has given me great satisfaction in being concerned in shewing mercy to such persons as seemed to have little or no mercy for us.  The account of your Journey & observations were very acceptable. I now recollect a letter I recd. from you some time since, & not being able to comply with your wishes, I inclosed it to Mrs. Holten; I have not the least doubt of your prudence & economy, but such are the times, that I am concerned for you, and I wish you not to live at any greater expence on acct. of your relation to me, than you otherwise wou'd; and I am deceived if you have not a wife, that will conform to what you think best: I flatter myself you will excuse the freedom I have now taken when I assure you it proceeds wholely from parental affection & concern; happiness doth not consist in the abundance of the things we possess in this life, but in virtue & religion added to a contented mind.  By the leave of providence I expect to be at home toward the last of Novr.  I took particular notice of Mrs. Websters \""kindest duty\"" & you will please to present her in return my most sincere love & affection. Yours, &c. ""

Situated as we are, we can make you no other return than our sincere thanks.(1) The definitive treaty was not signed on the 9th of August, all the powers had nearly agreed, and it is probable it is concluded by this time.

Sir Guy Carleton is slow in carrying into effect the orders he has received for the evacuation of New-York; so much so that it is doubtful whether they will be accomplished this Fall.

W. of the Ohio--we thought it our Duty to lay before Congress (1) and at the same time moved that it might be recommended to that State to take the most effectual measures to restrain its Citizens from a Measure which your Excellency seemd apprehensive might produce so many Evils to our State in Particular, and which we could not but think might be highly prejudicial to the Union in General. The fate of our Motion by no means answerd our Expectations--as you will see by the Enclosed vote.(2) The Chief Arguments against adopting it were--that Pennsylvania had already used every means in her power for that Purpose--that Congress had Issued a Proclamation prohibiting persons from Setling on Lands within the boundaries of the United States & out of the limits of any of them (3)--That such a resolution wd. reflect on the State of Pennsylvania, as it wd suppose that State to have been at least inattentive to a Subject  OCTOBER 4, 1783  which nearly concernd her own as well as the Welfare of the States in General--and that Congress had under consideration at this time the General arrangement of Indian affairs in which that Subject would be considered more comprehensively (4)--and only waited for the Confirmation of the acceptance of the Cession by our Assembly to take Vigorous and effectual measures to put a stop to the Evils which wd. result from such irregular Proceedings.

Mr. Oswald & Mr. Fitzherbert know this to have been the case, and will readily Confess and admit it. This mode of Expression was preferred by them as a more delicate mode of Excluding those refugees and making proper distinctions--between them and the Subjects of Britain whose only Particular Interest in America consisted in holding Lands and Property there.  The 6th Article viz where it declares that no future Confiscations shall be made &c.&c. ought to have fixed the time with greater Accuracy. We think the most fair and true Construction is that it relates to the date of the Cessation of Hostilities. We are Surprized to hear that any doubts have arisen in America respecting the time when the Cessation of Hostilities took Place. It most certainly took Place at the Expiration of one month after the date of that declaration in all parts of the World, whether Land or Sea that lays North of the Latitude of the Canaries.

It is not therefore Improbable that the preliminaries of peace may be the Articles that will be finally rattified with respect to the United States, in the Conclusion of the Treaties with the other Belligerent powers.  Our Ministers give it as their decided opinion that by the preliminary Articles, Hostilities were to cease in the American Seas north of the latitude of the Canaries in one month from their Rattification.  Congress have Resolved to put a Stop to all further loans in Europe a measure we Judge not only expedient but Absolutely necessary.(1)  This State, as also Pennsylvania have addopted the recommendation of Congress, we have enclosd the Act of the latter on that Subject.(2) Congress have allso come to a Conclusion to accept the Cession made by--Virginia under certain alterations, as containd in the enclosd reports.(3) Several other matters are now under consideration & will we hope be so far determined as may Speedily enable us to give your Excellency further Information.  We are with the most perfect Respect & Esteem, Your Excys Humbl Servts, Sam. Huntington Benj Huntington ""

  Dear Tucker Monday Octr. 6th 1783  The last post brought me your acceptable favor dated the 10th Ultimo--untill when I had concluded that either my Friends in Virginia had totally forgot me or that some person had pilferd my letters out of the Post office. For about six weeks had elapsed without receiving a Single line from one of my Friends in Virga. during which time Mrs.  OCTOBER 6, 1783  Bland and myself have written letters by Dozens. True it is that my intentions were to have left this place about the 15th of last month & to have reachd Virginia about this time but important dispatches having arrived from Europe and some matters of the first moment coming on about that time in Congress--I have on this as on many other occasions Since I became a Public Man postponed my own conveniency and Interest to the Public Weal and undergone too weekes more mortification, as well as risqued the danger of loosing the pleasure of Seeing you & Fanny before you took yr. departure for Bermuda. I have now fixed tomorrow for our departure from this place (1) and having left our affairs somewhat deranged--I fear it will take me near a fortnights residence in Philadelphia before I can adjust them so as to set forward for Virginia, so that I fear it will be near the End of this month before I can have the happiness of presenting my self to my Friends in that Country--from whose bosom I believe I shall never go again. You tell me Fanny is visiting the Sick without telling me who, which leaves me somewhat uneasy, as you have left me in the Dark whether my Father or some of your Family or some other of my Friends may not be the objects of her attention on that score. Having but little time it is scarce worth while to enter deeply on the Politics of the present day especially as I hope so soon to have the pleasure of Chattering them over with you at Cawsons. Patsy is well and desires her best love. Bob has had for some time a severe fit of Sickness attended with an Ugly Cough. I believe the remnant of the Meazles--he is getting better and I hope the Journey which he will be well able to take with us may be a means of restoring him to perfect health. My love to the boys & girls adieu and excuse me to Fanny for not writing by this post.  God Bless you all, Theok. Bland P.S. This day comes on the important Question of fixing on the permanent Residence of Congress (2)--the Candidates--N. York, N Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, viz «sopus, N York, Elizabeth Town, Newark, Brunswick, Prince Town, Trenton, Philadelphia, German Town, Wilmington, Annapolis, George Town, Williamsburg.(3) ""

  Dr Sir Boston Octr. 6. 1783 (1)  I arrived here the Saturday after I left Princetown, the passage was very short & agreeable, & I had the pleasure of finding my Family & Friends all well. The Court assembled the last week, & I delivered your Letters to those for whom they were directed. There appeared a great anxiety in the minds of all with whom I conversed as to Our political situation, they were very particular in their Enquiries as to the intention of Congress relative to the old money, Commutation, Civil List &c--after three days I was desired to attend the Senate. I obeyed, a variety of Questions were asked, that gave me an opening to say as much as I thought was prudent. I stated to them the situation of Our foreign negotiations, the disposition of the several Courts in Europe with respect to us, the consequent necessity of Our being vigilant & united, the state of Our public Treasury, the manner in which the Business of the Treasury has been managed, the powers exercised by the Superintendant & the Secretary for foreign Affairs &c, the Ideas of Congress as to the competency of the Confederation for the purposes to which it was intended, the Views of some in wishing to substitute a System of influence instead of specific constitutional Remedies for supposed defects in the Confederation, the Obstructions that exist in some states to the collection of Taxes, the Objections of Congress as to Our proposition as to the old money & Penobscot &c, & in short I gave them a general View of their Situation, exhibiting enough of the disagreable & alarming part, as near as I could Judge, to put them upon reflexion, without giving them so great a shock as might create too much distrust in Congress, or exciting too much uneasiness at the Conduct of Europeans. Some of the Gentlemen have since told me that they thought I was very clear in the account I gave & very prudent--some of the members of the house who knew of my being called before the Senate, wished to have the two houses together & urged it, but others who were by no means desirous of any information, lest it should impede their Views opposed & prevented it. I am told They are much cooler than they were last Session, indeed some of them who were very active in producing the undue warmth which then appeared, have observed to me that now both houses are in a much better Temper than before, & that they hope their Conduct this  OCTOBER 6, 1783  Session will be moderate & rational, particularly his honor the Lieutenant Govr. & the rev'd. Doctor (2) observed this to me, & that they regretted the indecent Conduct of the last Session. I replied that I supposed the designing unprincipled Individuals, who had labored industriously to raise their passions, having effected their Views, would now permit them to cool down & perhaps take great pains to reduce their Temper, a contrary disposition being now necessary to their present purposes. I made this reply in a manner & with a Tone that evidenced my intention to apply it to Them. I have been in the house but once, they happened then to be upon the Impost. I heard their debates for two hours & to my surprise I heard General Danielson say, that the Commutation must be complied with & ought not to be urged against complying with the recommendation. The house at that time however refused to comply, & negatived a proposition from the Senate to bring in a Bill granting the Impost as desired by Congress. Some were opposed to it on one principle & some on another, & for my own part I am willing they should adopt any principle of opposition to it they please, rather than comply, but I wish to have them oppose it on right rather than wrong principles.  The Senate have refused to change the rule for assigning Quotas, & I am inclined to think from present appearances that no part of the recommendation will be adopted this Session, & if it be not undone I fancy it never will. I have had very little Conversation with the members of the house, nor do I mean to say much to Them unless They inquire of me as to any particular points. The Committee have not communicated Our joint Letter to the Court, some of them have doubts as to the expediency of doing it, & as there seems almost a certainty of Their doing that which Our Letter was intended to effect, there will be no propriety in my urging the communication of it.  I observed that some of the Senate were affected, at the account I gave them of the Views of some of the European Powers as to America, & appeared somewhat surprised at the powers of some of Our great Officers, this will probably produce a proper degree of vigilance & Jealousy, & may serve to check two kinds of influence, which in my opinion are much too extensive in this State. Mr. Partridge, Mr. Danielson & Mr. Sullivan I am informed will certainly go on soon to Congress, the precise Views of these Gentlemen nor Their true political Characters am I acquainted with, but as I have no great Confidence in the two last, I hope you & Mr. Osgood will stay through the Winter, or at least till you see things well settled, or are satisfied that they, if you leave them, will do as they ought to do. A regard to the public good which I know you both have a large share of, will certainly require this of you, & it is the earnest wish of every One that I converse with upon this Subject. Should Bro. Holten be again elected which may be the case if either of these Gentlemen should de-  cline going, he will I hope remain with you through the Winter, for it is in my mind very important, that the Vote of Massachusetts should be right, if it is not, perhaps Congress may be again carried to Phila. or some other very great Evil ensue.  I find many people here that have some knowledge of the french politics, they are also apprehensive of an undue influence from Our great Officers, & have some suspicion of there being an Oligarchy or Aristocracy very soon established, if great Care is not taken by the members from the northward. Finding this Idea a prevailing One & the impression strong, I have as yet said but little about that matter, except to a few Individuals, from an Idea that if it becomes sufficiently extensive & operative without my interference, it will be better than when it should appear to proceed from me.  His Excellency has treated me very cooly & indeed rather Cavalierly,(3) he told me when I first met him, as I was going to the Council Chamber to pay him my respects, that he was happy he had by meeting me saved me the trouble of going there. This I considered as an intimation that he wished for no Conversation with me. I have therefore kept clear of him since & shall not put myself out of the way to show him any respect.  The Court has agreed upon giving you Instructions as to the place of residence. I have not seen the Instructions but am told that they prefer some good situation in the Jersies, or upon the North River. I had much talk upon this Subject with some of the leading men & impressed the necessity of Instructions not to restrain you but to govern others who may join you.  Octr. 8th. I am informed since writing the above that the houses are like to agree upon an Impost to be collected by & carried to the Credit of the State. They may perhaps agree also upon some other Tax that shall equal with the Impost to Their Quota of the Int[eres]t on the Debt. I wish them to evidence to Congress a determination to furnish their full proportion of the necessary Funds & in every way to support the federal government agreeable to the Confederation, but their full expectation that the other States will discover the same disposition & make like Exertions, should be stated in the strongest & most pointed Terms, & I should like to have Them go so far as to assure Congress that unless the other States can be brought to do Justice to this State & to give the strongest assurances that they will in future do Their full share, a continuation of Our Exertions must not be expected. I expect that you will receive Instructions to urge for a new arrangement of the Treasury & on several other important points.  A Committee is appointed to consider of a Cession of the vacant Territory & to propose our Claim to a large tract of Country which has been located by New York. I fancy they will cede all that Country which lies West of Hudsons River, & perhaps annex this condition,   that the other States shall all of Them cede the vacant lands, by them respectively claimed, to the acceptance of Congress. We have heard that a new attempt has been made to carry you back to Phila., but from the disposition that prevailed when I left you, I think it must have failed of Success. Being very much hurried in my own private Affairs, I have not time to write more than one Letter which I must pray you to consider as a Letter to the Delegation.  Brother Osgood is I suppose with you by this he can give you many particulars that probably are unknown to me, he & Dr. Holten will please to accept my respects, & I must pray you to give my compts. to Dr. Lee &c &c. I shall expect by return of post an account of what of importance has passed since I left you. May you be able to pursue & effect some of the great points we had in View, before you get fettered by removal from Jersey or by the arrival of new hands who will be opposed to you. I am with respect your most huml. Servant.  S.H. P.S. I forgot to give Mr. Harrison any directions as to Letters that might be sent to Phila. or Princetown. I wish you would be so kind to take care of those that may be in the Office at Prince Town & write a Line to Mr. Hazard desiring him to forward any that may be in the Office at Phila. to you.  ""

  [ante October 8, 1783] (1) The North American.(2) No. II. The object of the Author's first address to his countrymen, was to develope those causes of civil dissention, which if not early checked, would put a period to their domestic tranquility; and the design of these sheets is to unfold their relative situation, in the character they have assumed, as one of the nations of the earth. He made no modest professions of ignorance or unworthiness: he considers them as too often the cloaks of vanity or hypocrisy; he laid no claim to superior information: that is the folly of a weak intellect; and above all he avoided solemn assertions of patriotism or disinterested zeal, for them he receives himself, with caution, if not suspicion. The only introduction he will now make of his person or character; the only clue he will  OCTOBER 8, 1783  give to unravel his secret intentions in these addresses to his fellow citizens is, that they will never know him, and consequently should consider him a candidate--only for their attention.  If wealth, dignity and power create influence, and confer advantages on an individual, where an union of force extends the protection of law to the meanest member of society, and guards his rights from violation; we may conclude it a truth, (clear as the light) that they are essential to the welfare of nations, over whom there is no coercive hand of authority to enforce the dictates of reason, and compel obedience to the decrees of justice.  The subtle but degenerate successors of those Romans who rested the defence of their rights on the firm basis of power, and scorned to shelter them under the mean artifice of intrigue (become now a divided prey to numberless petty tyrants) have invented the much boasted political balance; but this effort of ingenuity and refinement, although a barrier to the limits of their separate despotism, does not shield them from the sanguinary effects of the contentions, success or misfortunes of their potent neighbours: they on their part cherish with unwearied assiduity, that disunion which has humbled with the dust the proud mistress of the world, and foster that anarchy and confusion with their attendants, corruption and profligacy of manners, which expose to derision and contempt, the descendants of a nation of heroes, who, when united, gave laws to civilized man.  On the continent of Europe, where an acquirement of territory would be an immediate accession of power to a rival Potentate, mutual jealousy may yield a temporary protection to precarious rights. But we have seen in our day the great inland powers dividing the fairest of all regions--one of her most powerful kingdoms, and prostrating the rights of its citizens, whose discord and anarchy had rent asunder the bonds of Empire, and opened easy avenues into the bosom of their country.  And if ever civil dissention should loosen that Gordian knot, which binds these States together, and leave them resting on their individual impotence and insignificance, it would not be our imbecility alone, which would tempt, but necessity that must constrain the great commercial powers, to divide those advantages, which we should discover a want of wisdom to retain, and which they can never permit one--exclusive to enjoy.  The late ungenerous, I may say hostile attack of Great Britain on our commerce, sprang confessedly from an early conviction, that we could not act as a nation; nor concert measures necessary for our mutual benefit and defence. Apprized that there was no general legislative power, vested in any one body, for regulating the commerce of this Continent, they presumed that the varying interests of the several States, co operating with the predilection of all for British manufac-  tures, would render abortive any restrictions or regulations with which we might combat their attempts; for such being laid or devised by one State, the hopes of drawing the trade to another, would prevent their adoption, and perhaps produce an encouragement.  These edicts of the British Council which openly disseminate those seeds of disunion which it will be the labor of their dispersed emissaries to cultivate--are framed on these principles, and with these expectations. They are to introduce into our harbours their manufactures, unrestrained by regulations or imposts, to which that concertion among the States (they treat with ridicule and contempt) is, they well know, only competent--this whilst our produce is to find no entrance into British ports, but under a load of duties so enormous and oppressed with restrictions so severe as to depreciate their value, or impede their sale--by confining advantages to one state, whilst they dart the keen force of resentment on another, they hope to rouse the jealousy of all. They cut off one of the most profitable branches of our commerce, cramp all and check that bold and adventerous spirit of enterprize, which promised to carry the flag of these States to the remotest corners of the globe, and was (we fondly hope) a sure and happy presage of a rising Navy of America, that might protect her commerce from injury or insult.  Presumptuous nation, secure in our disunion, thou hast ever been too eager, and thy premature violence has been the parent of our wisdom--catching at the glittering shadow--may the substance ever elude thy fangs.  It is hard to say whether cruelty or injustice predominates in their policy; but it is easy to determine that should the attempt succeed, it would decide on our peace and prosperity. They have sounded the alarm bell of interest throughout Europe, and the event of this restriction on our commerce, and insult on our national character, is waited for with impatience and with anxiety. The nations of the continent stand wavering on the brink of expectation--they cannot yet be persuaded that a rising people, whose unparaleled virtue and perseverance have drawn on them the blessings of the friends of freedom, and extorted admiration from the votaries of despotism, whose wisdom and heroism have been long the darling themes of panegyric, can the moment of success sacrifice to blind jealousy, and interested prejudices, the dear-bought fruits of their toils and sufferings. On the eve of laying every reciprocity at our feet, they now await the issue of this experiment: should the event be favourable for Britain, they must all pursue her example, least she should exclusively enjoy the superior and peculiar advantages, arising from her conduct. The die once cast, our fate would be irrevocably fixed, and the partition of our commerce would be but the prelude of those shackles which tyranny has invented as the sole security of injustice.   Awful is the tryal, and America! if thou falterest now the step can never be retrieved--the tottering beam poized in unskilful hands, will feel the weight of one act of imprudence, and the scale of evil preponderate forever.  Happily in these states where the spirit of freedom gives to no one class of citizens, the exclusive privilege of thinking and acting for the whole--the people at large, the enterprizing without temerity, and zealous without enthusiasm--brave and generous with capacities to distinguish, and the will to pursue their true interest; they want but information to render them superior to the machinations of intrigue, and the snares of treachery.  Let them then be taught as the first step to political wisdom, to discard a flattering delusion of their unsuspicious minds. They are persuaded that all the powers of the world are their friends. My countrymen! thy tyrant and oppressor was the tyrant and oppressor of mankind--it was his enemies you mistook for thy friends--it is time now you should be undeceived. There can be no splendid rising, but its rays will attract the mists of envy. Here, view thy portrait, drawn by the faithful pencil of just allegory. See a comely youth, conscious of his inbred merit, but unsupported by rank or fortune, offer himself a candidate for fame, wealth and honor--no sooner does he rear the modest brow, adorned with innocence and truth; but straight envy and jealousy stretch forth their cold, leaden hands to press him to the earth--the forked tongue of slander directed by a serpents eye, prying for some unguarded frailty, where to dart her venom, hisses her calumnies to the world. Still by the magic force of all-subduing virtue, he levels the mounds of prejudice, and plants his fame and fortune on the firm ground of power--wisdom and decision mature his honors. Then, and not till then flatterers and sycophants offer him the incense of adulation, and crouds of suppliants crouch beneath his frown. Pursuing such conduct Americans! such will be your reward. Be too wise to believe that thy vindication of the rights of mankind can be pleasing to despots, on whose governmnent it is a satire--or that the haughty monarchs of Europe are in haste to prostrate their dignity at the feet of untitled citizens, whom education and habit have taught them to contemn. No! if you dishonour the cause of freedom by anarchy--folly or injustice--with malicious pleasure, they will vaunt the tale, that would seem to legalize their usurpation--and riviting the chains still faster on their own subjects, haste to share thy spoils and feast on thy misfortunes.  Turn your eyes, my fellow citizens! to those powers, who are your neighbours on this continent. Here Great Britain first presents herself to your view, who still stretches an extensive territory on your northern boundary. Will she not call a wishful look on that fair tract which she has lately called her own? will she in a moment forget her Planta-  tions? will inbred pride, uncontrouled arrogance--insolence and superciliousness, fostered by long prosperity, give easy way to humiliation? Will she think no more of the millions she has lavished, to impose on you the yoke of tyranny? No! the glare of impending ruin, awakened in her a transient gleam of wisdom--the moment was improved into a cessation of hostilities and terms of pacification. Yet it could not be protracted to the completion of peace--jealousy, hatred and revenge clouded up the prospect, and the storm burst first on your rising, but unprotected commerce. Did she mean the injury and insolence of her servants, as the instruments of conciliation? And will she now ravish your confidence by crouding her troops on barren rocks round you? Can she fear the United States? Alas, they are poor, it will be long 'ere they recover from the deep wounds of her inflicting. Republics covet not conquests, they are not caught by the glitter of ambition. Let these states be on their guard, they have joined their efforts to British policy, in aggravating the fears and apprehensions, and adding fuel to the resentment, of the too criminal but unhappy loyalists; until from their enthusiasm, on a sudden has arose a powerful establishment, that will be a thorn in their side, founded in hatred and rivalship, thither has been collected the produce of rapine, piracies and robberies; together with all the riches lavished by a numerous and luxurious army. Will the frigid clime of Nova Scotia cool the glowing rancour of these men? or the loss of their fortunes diminish their resentment? No, every Tory is a torch to re-kindle the expiring flames of war.  Your fisheries in their neighbourhood will share the fate of your commerce. Your right to them was derived from nature, and has been recognized by compact; but rights of nations, who have not power to defend them, are as mortifying and useless as the fabled feasts of Tantalus.  To the south and on the west lay the unbounded dominions of Spain.  Although at this period it may be wise, to forbear strictures on the narrow and ungenerous policy this nation has pursued during the war, and which she seems yet undetermined to relinquish--and not to dwell on the old adage, that it is in vain to expect honesty in the absence of wisdom. Yet it must be clear, even to him who confines his scrutiny to the surface of events, that if order, peace and happiness are the rewards of our vigor and enterprize, it will not be the feeble hand of despotism, stretched at a distance from a corrupt and languid body, that will be able (assisted as it is, by all the machinery of monks, officers and standing armies) to keep down the rising spirit of human nature; in other words, that the revolution in the north, must produce insurrections in the south. Consequently we have grounds to apprehend, indeed we have reason to be assured that Spain and Britain, the other two American continental powers, leagued, by what they imag- OCTOBER 1783  ine to be, the tie of mutual interest, will view the prosperity of these states, with the jealous eye of suspicion, and cramping and checking their progress in concert; watch a favorable moment when they may profit of their folly.  Now let us bend our Attention to the Allies of these States. We have been too long accustomed to lean on the supporting arm of FRANCE. It is not only unwise and unsafe for one nation to calculate on the support of another; but support and protection are so nearly allied, and protection and dependance join each other by such an imperceptible connexion, that it is hard to say where the one begins, or the other ends--therefore to be truly free, we must depend only on ourselves. 'Tis true, the monarch of France has sacrificed his pleasures to public avocations, and his pomp and splendor to the ease and happiness of his people; and we have received favors from his hands that could have only sprang from the generosity and benevolence of his heart. These are fair claims to the most lovely characters, that of the Friend of mankind; but he would not only be unwise but criminal, if he should again sacrifice the money and strength of his subjects in our support, unless we now discover the wisdom to derive advantages from success, and he would ill repay the love and veneration of his people, if he did not pursue every measure to procure full repayment of the sums he has already advanced. France satisfied the great object of interest, when the separation of Britain and America was effected; but if it is still farther to be promoted, perhaps the most decisive means that could be employed would be a renewal of those measures that tend to their mutual distress. But whilst it would be cruel to suspect a violation of her engagements, we should not fail to recollect, that they are dissolved with our union.  Thus it is also with Holland and Sweden, with both whom we have concluded treaties; to the former we owe money, and they are jealous of a rivalship in the great support of their power, the carrying business. The Monarch of the other empire has deviated from the cold policy of most of the European Powers. Wisdom, generosity and decision early stamped his character; but still he and all the other Princes of the Continent, must pursue the line that will be marked out by the great maritime Powers; to these Great Britain has set an example, which if attended with success, both interest and necessity must render decisive.  The prospect which lie before us of domestic confusion and foreign war, is both gloomy and solemn. But still there is a light, although it glimmers at a distance. The cause which has interested every affection, and agitated every passion of the human breast can never be deserted or betrayed, nor the lustre of our rising Empire tarnished, nor its glory pass away like the blazing meteor that streams for a moment  OCTOBER 9, 1783  through the sky, and quickly vanishes in endless night. No! it shall be fixed as a constellation, to give light to revolving ages.  Liberty! thou emanation from the all-beauteous and celestial mind! to Americans thou hast committed the guardianship of the darling rights of mankind, leaving the Eastern world where indolence has bowed the neck to the yoke of tyranny; in this Western hemisphere hast thou fixed thy sacred empire; whilst the sons of Europe shackled with the manacles of oppression, sigh for thy safety, and pant for thy blessings; the band of patriots who are here thy votaries, cemented by thy invisible power, will be bound to the partners of their toil and dangers, by ties more close than those of kindred, more sacred than those of friendship. Inspired by the virtuous nations, who are now the pride, and will be ever the boast of America, will instill this holy truth into the infant minds of their children, and teach them to hold it sacred, even as the divine aphorisms of religion, that the SAFETY of AMERICA will be found in her UNION.

 Connecticut Delegates to Jonathan Trumbull, Sr. Sir, Princeton, Octor 9th, 1783.  In the course of a few weeks past Congress have receivd letters from our Ministers in Europe, Some of them dated as late as the 18th July. We have enclosd a copy of one from Mr Adams1 and extracts from several others.  Tho' we think it our Indispensible duty to lay this Intelligence before your Excellency for the Information of the Legislature, yet you will readily perceive the great impropriety of Suffering it by any means to get into the public papers.  No Intelligence of the completion of the definitive Treaty, & from the latest Information it Seems, if our ministers had not wisely Seized the critical moment during Lord Shelburne's Administration, very uncertain whether Hostilities would have ceased at this day, alltho' it is propable our enemies have no design to renew them Immediately. Congress are taking measures to reduce the national expence as much as possible by disbanding the remainder of the Army, reducing the number of our Ministers in Europe, discharging all Supernumeraries on the civil list, & curtailing the Salaries of those that remain in time of peace; a committee are appointed for those purposes which have made some progress in the business, but the army cannot be disbanded while the Brittish remain in New York, & the Safety of the nation renders it absolutely necessary to have a Suitable number of Troops ready to take possession of the present Brittish garrisons which fall within our limits at the moment they are evacuated by the Brittish, as Detroit, Niagara, Oswego, & near Cadaraqui, & Penobscott, &c., the last of which, it is reported, is allready evacuated, & that the Brittish are attempting Encroachments from Nova Scotia on this Side St Croix.  You have been allready informd that a Treaty of Amity & Commerce with Sweeden is ratified. The Emperor of Germany, the Courts of Denmark, Prusia, Portugal, Grand Duke of Tuscany, Spain, the Imperial free city of Hamburg, & Indeed allmost all the powers of Europe have Signified their desire to form Treaties of Amity & Commerce with these United States. It is thought by our ministers in Europe, and perhaps by all wise politi[ci]ans, of much importance to close with these offers upon terms of mutual reciprocity & thereby make it the Interest of all to Support us, & render us less dependant on any one of them.  The King of France in February last engaged to advance for the United States Six millions of Livres, & generously remitted the Interest until the first of January 1784, as he had before done with all his former loans, until the expiration of the war, but we are now requested to Inform what effectual measures Have been taken or are taking to pay the Interest in future & refund the Principal in a reasonable time; to attempt an Honorable a[n]swer to this question is truly mortifying to a generous mind; you will See Docr Franklin's Sentiments, in the extract enclosd.(2)  Last Tuesday came on the Important question for fixing a place for the Seat of Congress. After a deliberate discussion, the competition appeard to be between two places, the banks of the Pawtomac near Georgetown, and the banks of the Deleware near Trenton. The determination is in favour of the latter, but not with that unanimity that could be wished;(3) whither this determination will be found so agreable as ultimately to give Satisfaction & effectually ascertain the Residence of Congress, time will discover.  As neither of us thought of staying any longer than the present year when we came from home, we are not possessd of the Act of Assembly appointing delegates for the ensuing year; it will therefore be necessary for delegates to come forward with their Credentials for the next year, or leave the State unrepresented.  Congress have been employd some time in preparing matters for a Treaty with the late hostile tribes of Indians, in order Among other things to Settle a line or boundary for them & prepare the way to dis- OCTOBER 9, 1783  pose of some of the western lands, & by that means discharge a part of the national debt; when this business is finished it will be communicated to your Excellency.(4) We are disappointed in our hopes of a recess of Congress during this Autumn; the unexpected delay of the definitive Treaty & the important matters depending on that event render it alltogether unsafe for Congress to adjourn at present, and as full a representation as may be, Seems necessary. We have the Honour to be, with the highest Respect, Your most obedient, humble Servants,  Sam. Huntington.  Benj. Huntington.  ""

  Dear Sir. Princeton, 9th Oct. 1783  Agreeably to the order of the day, on Monday last, Congress took into consideration, the offers that had been made them by several of the states of a place for their permanent residence.  After lengthy debates the question was taken upon each State in the Union, begining at N.H., whether the buildings for the use of Congress shou'd be erected in that State, & it appeared, that four states were in favor of, New-Jersey, & four in favor of Maryland, & that Congress were greatly divided as to any other State, and I think Pennsa. had only her own vote in favor of that state.(1) On Tuesday Congress again proceeded upon the business, (2) of fixing their abode and the question was, whither, the buildings for the use of Congress shou'd be erected at or near the banks of the River Delaware or at or near the banks of the River Potowmacke, and it appeared that seven of the eastern states were in favor of the Delaware; the States of New Hampshire & Georgia were not represented; so that the buildings are to be erected at or near the falls of the Delaware, which is not far from Trenton & about 30 miles from Phila. but whether on the side of Pennsa. or N. Jersey is yet to be determined, a committee having been appointed to view the land.  OCTOBER 9, 1783  This day & yesterday has been taken up chiefly in debating where Congress shall hold their temporary abode but it is not yet determined, great pains are taken to prevail with them to return to Philada.(3) but I hope it will not take place, for reasons you will easily conceive.

  Dear Mr. Kettell.(1) Princeton, 9th October, 1783. I have been favored with your kind attention of the 15th of September.  The account you give me of the season is much more agreeable than I expected.  You have, I perceive, collected about as much of my small debts as I expected.  You are pleased to mention the quantity of syder you have made, which is two barrels more than I expected.  The Account you give me of your little son is very agreeable.  The good people must expect no definitive treaty of Peace at present, nor any commercial treaty with great Britain, for some time.  Unhappy for this people, that before they had finished one war, they have got into great difficulties among themselves, what will be the event time must determine.  Last week Congress gave their answer to the remonstrance from Massachusetts,2 but, I fear it will not satisfy the Honorable Court. What a pity, that when the good people might be so happy, on account of the glorious peace, that they are worrying themselves about commutation, when many people are of opinion that the officers could not now sell their paper securities for money enough to make good their wages that were first promised them.  OCTOBER 9, 1783  It is to be lamented that the State I have the honor to represent, are so dissatisfied with the proceedings of Congress, when I am sure both Congress & the state, are indeavoring to promote our national happiness; I shall continue my indeavors, while I tarry, to make things more agreeable to both; God grant that the union may not be dissolved, & the good people again involved in all the horrors of war.  On Tuesday last Congress determined to erect public buildings for their permanent abode, near the falls on the River delaware, about 30 miles above the city of Philadelphia, and about 12 miles from this place.  I took particular notice that Mrs. Kettell presented her duty, and please to make her in return, my kindest love & affection, yours, &c.  S. Holten P.S. I hope to be with you toward the last of November.  ""

  Dear Sir, (private) Princeton, October 9, 1783. In my last Letter to your Excellency I gave an Extract from a Letter received from the Ministers of the United States at Paris;1 and observed that the other Communications were under an Injunction of  OCTOBER 9, 1783  Secrecy: that Injunction being taken of, (2) I am at Liberty now to inform you of the most material Parts of their joint Letter which seems to be intended as an Explanation of the Preliminary Articles, & their reasons for agreeing to them in the manner they did. They observe that the words for restoring the Property of Real British Subjects were well understood between the Commissioners not to mean or comprehend American Refugees. Mr. Fitzherbert & Mr. Oswell [Oswald] (they say) know this to have been the Case & will readily confess and admit it. It was a more delicate mode of excluding the Refugees & making a proper Distinction between them and the Subjects of Britain whose only particular Interest consisted in holding Lands & property there. They also say, that the Sixth Article declaring that no future Confiscations shall be made &c. ought to have fixed the Time with greater Certainty. They think the most fair Construction is, that it relates to the Date of the Cessation of Hostilities as that in the Time when Peace in Fact took place in Consequence of prior informal the binding Contracts to terminate the War.  They consider the Definitive Treaty as only giving the Dress of Form to those Contracts and not as constituting the Obligation of them, and observe that had this Cessation of Hostilities been the Effect of a Truce and consequently nothing more than a Temporary Suspension of war, another Construction would have been the Right one.  Mr. Heartley has officially assured them that the orders for the Evacuation of New York will not be retarded by any avoidable Delay. They are of Opinion that had they proposed to find a Time for it; the British Court would have contended that it should be a Time posterior to the Date of the Definite Treaty & that would probably have been more disadvantageous to us than as that Article now stands. They observe the Time of Agreeing to those Articles as a very critical one and had a Delay taken Place most probably we should have had another Campaign.  By Private Letters from our Ministers and other Information, there is at Present no Prospect of a Treaty of Commerce being agreed to with Great Britain, nor the definitive Treatys being concluded, except by adopting the Preliminary Articles only. If no other advantageous Articles can be obtained tis expected this Treaty will soon be rectified.  Congress this week have resolved that Buildings be erected for the residence of Congress near the Falls of Trenton on the Banks of the Delaware.  We endeavoured to turn their attention to the State of New York for their residence but could obtain but one vote (viz Connecticut) except our own.3 I expect they will now adjourn from this Place (which cannot accommodate them in the winter season) to Philadelphia for their Temporary Residence till the Building's are prepared. New Jersey has offered Thirty Thousand Pounds, towards the purchasing   Lands and heating Buildings. We are informed this afternoon that Mr. Van Borkel the Minister from the United Provinces is arrived, after a very long Passage.  I expect to leave Congress the last of the next week or the beginning of the week after, and trust the State will excuse me, under my Circumstances, in leaving the State unrepresented a few Days: except am soon at Home to make the necessary Provisions for removing to Long Island, I shall be detained in Connecticut, on account of the season, till next Spring.  Gene'l Washington has lately received a Letter from Sir Guy that he has given orders for the Evacuation of Penobscot and directed the Transports that carryed the Refugees to Nova Scotia to take off the Garrison:(4) whether this will delay the Evacuation of New York or not I am unable to determine.

  Sir, Princeton Octr. 9th 1783 Since our last sundry letters have been received from Europe, some extracts from which have been sent to his Honour the Depy. Governor to be laid before the Genl. Assembly; others are inclosed on the paper No. 1. These extracts will give the views which the Ministers of the United States in Europe entertain on the subject of commerce & loans,(1) and regard to the operation of the orders of the British King in Council, regulating the British trade with the United States passed on the 14th of May, the 6th of June and the 2nd of August last, and which are inclosed in No. 2.(2) The present British Ministers, or rather coalition stands on a tottering foundation. No permanent regulations in regard to trade are soon to be expected. Their views may be pretty well understood from the letter and memorial of Mr. Hartley to the American Ministers dated June 14th 1783, copies of which are inclosed in the paper No. 3.(3) Since the independence of Ireland their trade will doubtless take a different turn as well as that of the U. States. Nova Scotia and Canada,  OCTOBER 9, 1783  and the Floridas are in a new situation. By all which events the trade of Great Britain will be essentially affected: And so extensive and complicated are the mercantile interests of the British empire that time and experience are necessary to enable the British to adopt such measures as may best console them for the dismemberment of the Empire, and tend to secure to them the advantages of their remaining commercial resources.  Their great object seems to be to secure to themselves the carrying trade in order to sustain their navy and maintain their empire over the seas.  By the 4th, 6th and 9th articles of ConfOEderation the particular States retain their power of imposing duties and the exclusive regulation of their trade, excepting the trade with the Indians, not members of the States, which is under the controul of Congress.  It ought not to be concealed from you, that Congress are drawing up an address to the States on the subject of commerce; and that it is the opinion of several members that Congress ought to call on the States to vest them with the power of regulating the trade of the United States.  Your delegates have conceived it their duty to oppose every motion of this kind in virtue of their general instructions to preserve the confOEderation, and the sovereignty of the State inviolate. The extract from the journal in No. 4 will show what has been done on this head.(4) Your delegates have thought proper to inclose a copy of the memorial to Congress from the state of Massachusetts in No. 5, (5) in order that those States which labor under similar grievances may adopt similar measures for redress. The effects of this memorial are well detailed in a letter from the delegates of Massachusetts to the Honble S. Adams Esqr. chairman of a committee of correspondence with the delegates of that State, an extract from which has been put into our hands with liberty to make such use of it as we might judge expedient, this is contained in No. 6.(6) After long debate on the Subject of Western territory Congress have agreed to a report of a Committee to whom was referred the consideration of the cession of Virginia. No. 7 contains a copy of this resolution.(7) The necessity of the case and the peculiar situation of public affairs can only justify this measure; as the cession is clearly less liberal than the public had a right to expect.  More than three years have elapsed since Congress recommended to the States claiming Western territory to make liberal cessions thereof. Three cessions only have been made. The Cession of Newyork was accepted last year, that of Connecticut contained in No. 8 has been repealed by that State since the arrival of peace.(8) And altho' Virginia has been precluded from repealing her cession by Marylands acceding to   the confederation in consequence thereof, see No. 11, (9) little or no hope remained of her ever making it more liberal & extensive. And should Virginia, following the late example of No. Carolina, have opend her land-office and refused to listen to conciliatory measures the consequences to the public could not readily be foreseen.  The legislature of Virginia will soon convene, and it is expected conform their cession to the views of Congress. In case of her refusal different measures must be adopted to obtain public justice on this subject.  The delegates for No. Carolina have written to their State in the most urgent terms to induce them to make a cession of part of their western claims. What Georgia will do is altogether uncertain. But by accepting the cession of Virginia we shall have an additional voice for obtaining cession of other States.  The paper No. 9 contains the cession of Virginia.(10) It has been earnestly contended that they should relinquish all their claims over the Alleghany mountain. In alleviation of the public disappointment, by failing in this point, it may be observed that the lands appropriated by Virginia to her line at all events must have been taken out of these western claims, that near 8000 inhabitants have planted themselves on the Southeast side of the Ohio at Kentucky and other Settlements whose claims would most probably have been allowed by the public, and formed another large deduction: And finally that the Indiana claims on account of which is contained in the paper No 10 would also have formed another large deduction;(11) so that on the whole the policy of contending with Virginia by coercive measures to relinquish her claim Southeast of the Ohio appeared at least questionable. The lands already ceded to the United States, should Virginia conform to the views of Congress, are estimated by the best informed to amount to upwards of five hundred thousand square miles. Allowing the State of Rhode-Island to strike one fiftieth our share would amount to ten thousand square miles; a territory of ten times the extent of the whole State.  A proclamation has issued from Congress prohibiting all persons from purchasing or accepting cessions of land from the Indians without the limits of the particular States, and declaring such purchases & cessions null & void; also prohibiting settlements on said lands.(12) And it is in contemplation to lay off a suitable district from the same for a new State, to be disposed of to satisfy the public engagements to the army and to form a fund in aid of public credit.  On the fifth instant came on the great question respecting the permanent residence of Congress. After some debate it was agreed that each State in order should be in question. After separate votes were taken on each particular State it appeared that N. Jersey & Maryland stood highest, each having four voices in its favour.  OCTOBER 11, 1783  On the sixth a motion was made that buildings suitable for the accommodation of Congress be provided and erected either on the banks of the Potowmack or on the banks of the Delaware. This passed into a resolve by general consent.  On motion, it was then resolved that the banks of the Delaware be the place. It was next resolved that the particular spot should be near the falls of Delaware in the vicinity of Trenton, by seven States. Eleven States being present the ballance of interests was not affected by the two extreme States being unrepresented.  We are with the highest sentiments of respect, Your Excellys most obedt. Servants, William Ellery  David Howell ""

The letters received from our ministers (the last dated 9th Augt)(1) make it probable that the definitive treaty would be soon concluded, but not consist of any other articles than those of the provisional treaty. Commercial matters it was expected would be transacted seperately. The proclamation of the King of England of the 2d July, published in the news papers, is sufficient to inform you of the system the British ministry intend to pursue.(2) Sir Guy Carleton in a letter to General Washington laid before Congress the 9th inst, says \""that he has ordered several transports which sailed with refugees for Nova Scotia, to proceed immediately after performing that service to Penobscot, to remove from thence the Kings troops and stores.\""(3) Last Monday having been the order of the day for taking into consideration the proper place for the permanent residence of Congress.

  Sunday 12 Octbr. 1783 I added a few lines to my letter by post, under a very afflicting head ache.(1) To day I find myself greatly releived from this complaint, and imagine it proceeded from the debates of last week, which were long, renewed, continued, repeated, and more violent and acrimonious than any I have been witness to in Congress. They began on Monday and ended about 4 o'clock on yesterday. The subject was the permanent and temporary residence of Congress.  There is great truth, my Peggy, [in] the observation, that the value of any thing is not properly considered till after its loss. Philadelphia is now sensible of the additional weight she had in the councils of the union, by the residence of Congress; and how important this circumstance was to the whole State, by the fresh wealth it was daily bringing into it. She has used uncommon efforts to get Congress back, and vexed herself to the heart, that she did not exercise more forecast when she had them. Philadelphia had but one vote for the permanent residence and five for the temporary. Where Congress shall ultimately fix is still undetermined.  Will my Peggy indulge me in a reflexion on this occasion. Now that I know we are mutually dear and necessary to each other, I shall not, like the foolish Philadelphians, part with so valuable an inmate as your affection; but cherish it with all possible care--call forth every passion to defend it against whatever would do it an injury, or disturb its repose--and endeavour by the tenderest returns to make its residence with me perpetual.  Miss Yard will be entrusted with this letter under the usual precaution. She is--but I must stop telling you what she is--Doctor Williamson has made his appearance, and we have much to talk over respecting the business of the week.

As I was was looking at your letter I perceived on the wafer a little circle that appeared to have been made by the edge of your thimble. You will laugh perhaps, when I tell you, that the discovery of this little circle gave me more pleasure than I could have received from a view of the impression of the finest seal in the world. I instantly associated with the thimble that made it, the finger it had often embraced, and I kissed the little circular impression, as I would have kissed the little hand to which the thimble belonged.

  My dear Sir Philada. Octr. 13th. 1783 I returned here yesterday in order to be with Mr. Jones before his departure and make some little arrangements with him of a private nature. The past week has been spent by Congress in deliberating on 1. their permanent seat, 2. their temporary one. The competition for the former lay between the falls of the Potowmack and those of the Delaware. We hoped at first from the apparent views of the Eastern Delegates that they would have given a preference to Potowmack. In the event they joined with Pena. & the intermediate States in favor of the Delaware the consequence of which is that the vicinity of its Falls is to become the future Seat of the fOEderal Govt. unless a conversion of some of the Eastern States can be effected. The next point was the abode of Congs. untill their permaneut seat could receive them. The expediency of removing from Princeton in order \""to the more convenient transaction of the affairs of the U.S. and accomodation of Congs.\"" was first determined on, Massts., Cont. & R.I. alone being opposed to it. Trenton was next proposed, on which Question the votes were divided by the River Delaware. Philada. came next in order. Besides its convenient position in relation to the Permanent seat, & superior temporary accomodations for the pubic business and for Congs., arguments in its favor were drawn from the tendency of passing by these accomodations to others inferior in themselves & more distant from the permanent seat, to denote a resentment unworthy of a Sovereign authority agst. a part of its constituents which had fully expiated any offence which they might have committed: and at the same time to convert their penitential and affectionate temper into the bitterest hatred. To enforce this idea some of the proceedings of Congs. expressive of resentment agst. Philada. were made use of. Great stress also was laid on the tendency of removing to any small or distant place, to prevent or delay business which the honor & interest of the U.S. require sd. be dispatched as soon as possible. On the other side objections were drawn from those sources which have produced dislikes to Philada. and wch. will be easily conjectured by you. On the question N.Y., Pa., Delaware, Virga. & N. Carolina were ay; Massts., Cont., R.I., N. Jersey no; and Maryland & S. Carolina divided.(2) If either of the divided States had been in the affirmative it was the pur- OCTOBER 13, 1783  pose of N. Jersey to add a seventh vote in favor of Phila. The division of S. Carolina was owing to the absence of Mr. Rutlidge & Mr. Izard both of whom would have voted for Phila. The State was represented by two members only. The division of Maryland represented by Mr. Caroll & Mr. McHenry was occasioned by the negative of the latter whose zeal for Annapolis determined him to sacrifice every consideration to an experiment in its favr. before he would accede to the vote for Philada.(3) The aversion of the Eastern States was the ground of his coalition with them. The arguments in favor of Annapolis consisted of objections agst. Philada. Those agst. it were chiefly the same which had been urged in preference of Philada. On the question the States were Massts., Cont., R.I., Delaware, Maryland & N.C. ay. N.Y., N.J., Pa., Virga. no. S.C. divided.(4) Virga. was represented by Mr. Lee, Mr. Mercer & Mr. M.(5) The first was in the affirmative. Mr. Jones & Mr. Bland were in Philad. The vote of the latter wd have been in favor of Annapolis, of the former in favr. of Philada. The opinion of Mr. L. & Mr. B.(6) in favr. of Annapolis resulted from a dislike to Philada. & the idea that the views of Virga. would be promoted by it. That of their colleagues from a belief that the reasons drawn in favr. of Philada. from the national consideration reqd. a concession of local views, and even that a recision of the permanent vote for Trenton in favor of George Town, the object of Va. would be promoted by placing the Eastern States in Philada. They also supposed that the concurrence of the Eastern States in a temporary vote for Annapolis to take effect some weeks hence, was little to be confided in, since the arrival of a colleague to the Delegate from N. Hamshire would with the accession of Pena. who wd. prefer Trenton to Annapolis & be moreover stimulated by resentment, would make up seven States to reverse the removal to Annapolis. Add to the whole that experience has verified the opinion that in any small place Congs. are too dependent on courtesy & favor to be exempt either in their purses or their sensibility from degrading impositions. Upon the whole it is most probable that Philada. will be abode of Congs. during the Winter.(7) I must refer to Mr. Jones for explanations on all these points; he will be in Richmond early in the Session. For myself I have engaged to return to Princeton to attend some interesting points before Congs. Having not yet settled my arrangements for the Winter, I must for the present be silent as to my [future?] situation. Mr. Van Berkel arrived a few [days ago].8 Congs. are in a charming situation to receive him, [being?] in an obscure village, undetermined where they will spend the Winter, and without a Minister of F.A. After the rect. of this you will stop your correspondence, and probably not hear further from me. I set off tomorrow morning at 3 oClock in the Flying Machine for Princeton, and it is now advancing towards the hour of Sleep.

  Dear Hannah Monday Octr. 13. 1783  Saturday was spent in fruitless debates about the temporary residence. The unaccommodating spirit of some And the jealousy nay I may say the deep rooted hatred which others bear to the city of Philadelphia were displayed in the strongest colours. You will naturally ask to what cause can this be attributed. For my own part I am at a loss to determine. Much was said of the influence which that city had on the proceedings & acts of Congress. And yet this was disavowed by every man. Those who asserted it in the strongest terms were careful at the same time to intimate that it neither had nor could have any operation on them, and those that denyed the influence, & some of them had long been members of & given the closest attendance to the business of Congress, declared they had never seen any symptoms of such influence. They considered the insinuation as dishonorable & called upon the assertors of this influence to produce a single instance of it. After repeated calls Mr. Gerry undertook in a former day's debate to point out particular instances. But those he produced were so contemptible, so ill grounded & baseless, as only to raise indignation and to shew that there was no foundation for the suspicion, that it was either imaginary or mere pretence. One of the instances he produced was in the conduct of Mr. Bingham while he was agent in Martineque. A Boston Privateer had at an early period of the war & before France acknowledged the independence of America, captured a vessel in the west-Indies & carried his prize into Martineque. Complaint of this was made to the governor by the English, And as the governor wished to favour the Americans he evaded the complaint by ordering the vessel & cargo to be sold & the proceeds to [be] deposited in the hands of an Agent, till the matter could be enquired into. The Agent he fixed upon was Mr. Bingham, who appeared there only in  OCTOBER 13, 1783  the character of a merchant & who employed the proceeds for the public service in forwarding military stores for the use of our Army, at the same time informing Congress of his proceedings that they might take measures to reimburse him, if the Money should be ordered to be paid to the original owners or to satisfy the captors if it should be adjudged to them. After the treaty with France the captors instituted a suit against Bingham for the money. Bingham applied to Congress and Congress were so well satisfied with his conduct that they ordered the suit to be discontinued & took the matter upon themselves.(1) The other influence was an affair which not long since happened near New Orleans. A privateer was fitted out at Boston to cruize off the mouth of the Mississippi. She there captured a ship that was not only under the protection of a flag, but under that of a spanish fort and in possession of a Spanish pilot sent out to conduct her in. There were sundry circumstances attending the capture, highly derogatory to the honor of the spanish flag and contrary to the laws of nations and these were aggravated by a flagrant breach of the laws of hospitality. The prize nevertheless being carried to Boston & libelled was condemned in the court of Admiralty, but on an appeal the judgment was reversed and thereupon Congress recommended it to the state of Massachusetts to take measures for punishing two of those concerned in the capture for the insult offered to the Spanish flag & the violation of the laws of neutrality. Though neither of the judges of the court of appeals who reversed the sentence were inhabitants of Pensylvania, yet this was quoted as an instance of the influence of Philada. on public measures.(2) On Saturday Mr. Lee proceeded to quote the appointment of Mr. Morris & the powers vested in him as an instance of that influence. But though he did not convince any by this instance he confirmed the opinion that private pique & resentment were his governing principles. The motion that was under debate on Saturday was to remove to Annapolis. Howell declared that rather than go to Philadelphia, if the vote for Annapolis was lost, he would vote for Williamsburg or Charlestown nay even for Savannah in Georgia--That a Vote for Philadelphia was a high insult to the eastern states and this assertion passed uncontradicted by any member from those states, nay they seemed to confirm it by their unanimous vote to pass by Philadelphia & reside in Annapolis till next June. However the questtion was not carried. The debates were continued till after 4 P.M. and the house broke up in such very bad humour that I had some apprehensions they would not meet again. However upon recollection the members determined to continue in town, & try what can be done this morning. Yesterday I took a ride to Trenton to view the banks of the river. There is a delightful Spot on the Pensylvania side for a small town. It commands a very extensive & beautiful prospect both up & down the river & over the Jersey & has many natural advantages; but   the ground plot is rather too small. However I think it bids fair to be the place for the permanent residence of Congress and may hereafter be distinguished by the name of Statesburg. Adieu my dear Hannah, I hope you got safe home & found your family well. I am with sincere affection, your loving husband, Cha Thomson ""

  Dr Sir, Boston Octr. 14th 1783 The last week I wrote to Mr. Gerry a Letter, which I desired him to communicate to you & Mr. Osgood.(1) I meant, that it should be considered as to the Delegates, as I had not time to write to you separately. I then mentioned the disposition of the Court, as to the recommendations of Congress, & intimated that they probably would not grant the Impost as desired by Congress. The information which I gave to the Senate, has been by them retailed to the members of the house, & has produced as I am informed, no small fermentation, probably their own Comments & colourings may have increased it, much beyond what my own Relation would have produced. This effect I expected, & I thought it very probable, that their Communications would not exactly correspond with the information I gave them. The opposition to the System of Congress, I also expected, would thereby be increased, in as great a degree as I find it has been; but the Effect of my information has been much more than balanced, by the extracts from John Adams's Letter, which Mr. Morris transmitted to the Governor,(2) for the purpose no doubt of urging the Court to a compliance with the recommendation--I mean that part of his last Letter, in which he presses so much, that full provision should be made for the foreign Debt. Had they in this instance received the whole of Mr. Adams's Letter, perhaps a very different effect than that, which was intended or wished for, might have now been visible; for they would then have seen, that the Extract sent them, was a part only of a System, which Mr. Adams has recommended, & a part not more agreeable to their Views, than that which has been kept back. Mr. Morris no doubt very well knew, that no other part of the Letters from Mr. Adams, would answer his purpose, he also knew the high character of Mr. Adams in this State, & the influence which his Opinion has usually had with  OCTOBER 14, 1783  Our Legislature; such part therefore of his Letter, & such only, as would serve to forward the Views of Congress, has been communicated. The extract & Mr. Morris's reasoning upon it, has made a very strong impression on the minds of many in both houses, & I now think it very uncertain, whether it will not yet be adopted upon the plan of Congress; the parties appear to be now nearly equal in the house, the Senate are all but two in favour of it. But is it not a scandalous practice for Congress or their Servants, to send extracts of Letters & mutilated information to the States, in order to hurry them into their measures?(3) Is it dealing fairly with them, to give them a partial View only of their Situation, & conceal from them one side, & perhaps the most important One of the Picture? Has not this practice in the British ministry been reprobated by us & stiled infamous? Has it not always been considered by us, when practised by them, as evidencing wrong Views & dishonest intentions? If it is meant that the States should see & Judge for themselves, ought they not to be furnished with all the Evidence necessary to form a right Judgement? Can a free Government be supported, or administered with energy & dignity, but by enjoying the full Confidence of the People, & can that Confidence possibly exist for any length of time, when the people are practised upon in such manner? Whatever may be done with respect to the Impost, I am very sure that nothing will be done as to The tax required, & the former without the latter can have no effect; many of those who are the strongest supporters of the Impost, will as warmly oppose the granting a specific Tax for 25 years, nor would They by any means consent to the Impost, but for a persuasion that it will in its operation affect only the Seaports & mercantile part of the State--though when pleading for the Impost, they urge it upon principles of Justice & equallity, & upon this ground contend that it should be general, to preserve the appearance of consistency, yet nothing is more evident, than that they disbelieve the principles they advance, & are urged to support the Impost in order to exonerate themselves by increasing the burthens of others. They are even willing, that Connecticut & New Hampshire, should share in the plunder of their fellow Citizens, since the principles on which it must be obtained necessarily involves the right of those States, to partake with them of the Booty--this though it furnishes us with a strong proof of their Sagacity, reflects upon them no honour & pays to their honesty no compliment.  The Opposition to the Commutation decreases, having effected their purpose, the Quacks who raised the Fever, are now using all their Arts to reduce it. I should not be surprised if the next Session, it should unanimously be approved of (4)--the influence that raised the opposition to it, may effect any thing they please, the Court is a mere Machine, set in motion & directed in its movements, almost wholly by an extraneous influence--a few Individuals, attentive to their Busi-  ness, & properly instructed from the great Source of intelligence & of power, appear clearly to have the absolute management of the affairs of this State--having such an influence, They make a very industrious use of it, & probably may get things exactly into the Train they wish-- this being effected however, it is by no means sure that the consequences will be such as they expect--when the String is strained to a certain degree, it is true, that either the desired Change in the Government may be brought about, or general Confusion must ensue--if in such Case, the people should get a View of this Situation, alarmed at their danger, they may perhaps not only extricate themselves, but involve all those who have been practising upon them, in our common destruction--which of these Events is the most probable, I know not, but if the present measures are pursued & with the same high hand, I think one or the other must certainly take place. Having now retired from the field of Politics & with a full resolution never more to enter it, I feel like the Passenger we hear of, who was very indifferent as to the fate of the ship. Having no share in the management of it, he fancied himself no way interested in the Issue. When I speak of the Court I mean not every One who composes it. There are many who are judicious, independent & I believe virtuously attached to the public weal. I conjecture that they will spend much time upon the Impost. The opposition will grow weary, it will then be adopted & the Session ended. The Answer to the Remonstrance has not yet been received by the Court, though I suspect it is in Town.(5) If that should be communicated, it may have some effect.  I have urged them to make a Cession of their vacant Territory, to instruct Their Delegates upon several important points, that I think they will urge, & must wish to do it with as much weight as they can, but I fancy nothing will be done of that kind this Session.  I write you freely & loosely as to the situation of things here. It may serve to amuse you & nothing more, but I trust you will amuse only yourself & your Colleagues & the General (6) with it. As it is much easier for you to write me, each of you separately, than for me to write separately to you all, I shall hope for a few communications of Congressional Affairs from you all, when leisure will permit.  Your Letter I recd. by the post & thank you for it. The Letter you refer to in it was as you supposed & was misapprehended. My next will be to Mr. Osgood & then the General. I cant yet learn whether any of your Colleagues intend joining you, some think that S. & D. will soon, but I suppose Mr. P. will be the first.(7) My regards & best wishes attend you all.

  Dear Hannah, Tuesday Oct 14 1783 I received your letter of the 12 by the Stage and was much pleased to hear of your safe arrival. You cannot be more uneasy than I am at our being separated. If the submitting to these inconveniences answered any good purpose, or if it were necessary for promoting the interest or happiness of our country I could more easily acquiesce. But I confess my situation is the more irksome as I plainly see that the measures which led to it and the spirit and temper which continue it evidently tend to a dissolution of the Union of these states and will if I am not greatly mistaken involve our country in new calamities. It cannot admit of a doubt that the peace, happiness and prosperity of these new and rising republics depend greatly on a close and intimate Union. And yet the temper, disposition and views of the inhabitants are so discordant, that I have serious apprehensions they will not be long kept together & that the predictions of our enemies will but too soon be verified in the dissolution of our Confederacy. Whether this is the intention of some men now in Congress or whether their conduct is guided by the prevailing sentiments of the states they represent or actuated by private motives I will not undertake to say. But this I will venture to assert particularly with regard to Howell, that were he in the pay of G. Britain I do not know any line of conduct he could pursue other than what he has done to answer his purpose and promote the designs of his employers. This you will say is harsh. It is so and I hope I may be mistaken. But the tenor of his conduct is so uniform, the means he uses to accomplish his purposes so unjustifiable and unrestrained by truth, and those purposes, in my opinion, so opposite to the interest, honor and dignity of the Union, that I cannot reconcile them with the true principles of policy and patriotism. I might say the same of some others who have co-operated with him; but they discover such strong traits of envy, & personal resentment that these may in some degree account for their conduct.  Yesterday we had nine states on the floor, and to day I am informed we may expect eleven. A motion was made by Mr Mercer and seconded by Mr Lee to adjourn to Williamsburg. This I believe was made without any expectation of being carried. For an amendment, which was offered to shew that the adjournment was only for a temporary residence, was negatived by the mover and that being lost the eastern states could not give their assent & therefore the motion for Williamsburg was lost.(1) I am told it is in contemplation with some of the eastern states to propose a coalition with the southern and reconsider the vote for fixing the permanent residence near the falls of Delaware.  OCTOBER 14, 1783  And this being carried, either to fix the permanent residence at or near Georgetown on Potomack, or to establish two places for the meeting of Congress, one in or near the eastern states and the other in one of the southern states. This if carried will shew such a pointed resentment against Pensylvania and will so disoblige New Jersey, that I am confident it will throw them out of the Union. And the consequence will be that this Continent will be split into three divisions, the Eastern, middle & Southern. And all things considered I do not know but this may be for the general good & the best that can [be] done for the interest and happiness of the whole, provided the several districts confederate together for the purpose of general defence. It seems to be the order of providence that this world should be divided into a number of seperate & distinct governments.

  Sir Princeton 15th October 1783.  I enclose extracts of Letters from Mr Adams relative to trade,(1) and am to acquaint your Honr. that I have not been able to obtain any determination on the subject of the Loan Office Certificates,(2) neither do I think any step will be taken in this matter by Congress. The objections are, that complying with the request will derange the System of Finance and therefore ought not to be granted. I am not alone however, in being of a different opinion, the Massachusetts and Rhod Island delegates and some other States are for the Measure. In my opinion, if the State cannot find a method for dividing the collection by those certificates the collecting the whole tax for the current Year will be very difficult & burthensome; I therefore think it would be proper to direct the Loan Officer to liquidate all certificates issued from the Office in New Hampshire and held by the citizens thereof & to issue certificates for the Interest, this measure, those who oppose the request from [the] State I have the Honr. to represent, say she is fully authorized to take.  Congress have in contemplation a reduction of the National expences, by lessening the civil List, disbanding part of the Army, & reducing the Salaries of the public Officers, as the expenses of living are lessen'd. They have also before them a report for making peace with the Indians, and insisting on their making sessions of some part of the Lands they claim, to compensate for the injuries they have done the United States since the War. The subject of laying out & arranging a New State in the Western territory, for satisfying the Army, and discharging the public debts, is likewise under consideration & in some forwardness.  The resolution of Congress fixing the place of residence on the Delaware, at, or near the falls above Trenton, is not satisfactory to the Southern States. The place of temporary residence hath been much agitated, Motions for Trenton, Philadelphia, Wilmington, Anapolis and Williamsburgh have been negatived; at present the Question of temporary residence sleeps.  While these important matters are depending it is very unfortunate that New Hampr. hath not her Vote. I must desire the State to make me soon, some further advance in Money or Bills; it being probable I shall be destitute of Cash, by the time it can be forwarded to me. I have the Honr. to be with great respect and esteem, your Honours very Humble & most obedient Servt Abiel Foster  OCTOBER 15, 1783  ""

  Dear Hannah Wednesday Oct 15. 1783 It is mentioned by historians that the Emperor Titus recollecting that he had passed the preceding day without any act of benevolence or doing any worthy his high rank, broke out into this exclamation \""O my friends I have lost a day.\"" Those to whom the affairs of these infant states are intrusted, have little of the feelings or recollection of Titus or sure I am my ears might be frequently dinned with similar exclamations.  Yesterday Mr. Madison and Mr. Read returned from Philadelphia. It was expected that Mr. Rutledge would have accompanied the latter. But as that was not the case and as Mr. Beresford did not attend and Delaware was unrepresented we had only nine states, so that the question about the temporary residence was not taken up. A report was therefore called for respecting Indian affairs and as this comprehended a paragraph relative to the expediency of laying off a district in the western country and erecting it into a seperate government as well for the purpose of satisfying the claims of the army as for the accommodation of such as might incline to become purchasers & settlers in that district, a question arose, in what manner they ought to be at first governed. It appeared evident at the first glance that it would be improper and dangerous to suffer people to settle that country without any restrictions or government. The land belonged to the United states, it was part of their territory & was to be disposed of for the benefit of the whole, & the people who should inhabit it when sufficiently numerous were to form a component part of the Union & to be entitled to a representation in the Congress of the United states. To set off a district and at once declare it to be a free, sovereign and independent state, would be to make a cession of it to the first stragglers who might settle there & would be a relinquishment of all the benefits expected to be derived from the sale of the lands; and to permit the first settlers to erect what government they pleased and under that government admit them into the Union might endanger the liberties of the confederated states & those republican principles which formed the basis of their several constitutions. For these reasons it was proposed that Congress should prescribe the terms of purchase & settlement, & prepare for them a temporary form of government, under  OCTOBER 16, 1783  which they should live till their numbers and circumstances were such as might intitle them to a representation in Congress, at which time they should be permitted to form a constitution for themselves not incompatible with the republican principles which are the basis of the other states in the Union. This was opposed by Rhodeisland out of a pretended zeal for liberty. Mr. Howell contended that the settlers whether few or many had a right immediately to form a constitution for themselves and to make laws for their own government; that denying them this privilege was to establish a tyranny. After a great deal of debate which consumed the day he was at last overruled by a vote and the house adjourned.(1) After the adjournment Mr. Fitzsimmons took leave of the members being determined as he said never [to] meet them again. I am really sorry Congress is deprived of his abilities. He is a man of great candour, sound judgment and well informed and was very useful especially in matters of accounts and finance.  I received no letter by yesterdays stage though I dare say you wrote. I hope you are well. Please to remember me to all friends.  I am with sincere affection, your loving husband Cha Thomson ""

  Dear Sir, Princeton, Ocr. 16th. 1783.  I receivd your favor of the 1st by last post. No day is fixd for entering upon the business of Consuls, & it seems the opinion of some that no Minister above them shoud be continued in Europe unless for very extraordinary. We tried upon another occasion to obtain a resolution that none but Citizens shoud be eligible to the Office of Consul, which woud have excluded a great number of Candidates. But we lost the question.(1) The attempts to get us into Philadelphia, tho strenuous, have been hitherto resisted, & I hope will continue to be so, or I am satisfyd we shoud have the most ample reason to rue it.  I enclose you a continuation of some strictures on the Philadelphia Address, which I observe were printed in one of your Papers. They are necesary & compleat the proof of the impudence of the Addressers. I shall be obligd to you [to] send these to the same Printer that he may insert them also.(2) Please to make my respects to Mrs. Warren, & remember me to your Son. Farewell. A.L. ENCLOSURE Continuation of the Strictures on a late Address to Congress from some of the Citizens of Philadelphia &c. Gentlemen, I had the honor of shewing you, in my former Address that what some of your Citizens had the confidence to assert in their Address to Congress, namely--that you had in an essential manner  OCTOBER 16, 1783  distinguish'd yourselves by every exertion which principle coud inspire or fortitude support--was not quite consonant to truth. That measuring your exertions with your means they appeard the most feeble in the union. That tho' essentially distinguishd from the other States in the Union by the vast profits, emoluments and advantages arising from the residence of Congress--their treasury--Officers--& the foreign Ministers among you; by freedom from an Enemy or Impress among you for several years; prospering in agriculture, trade, & commerce--you had been almost as deficient in the whole of your contributions as those States which were essentially distinguishd from you--by the devastation of their fields--the destruction of their Capitols-- the interruption of their trade, & commerce--& by all the calamities, which internal war can bring upon a distressd People.  The object of this Address will be, to prove to you, that if you have been justly chargeable with defective exertions in furnishing your quota to the field, & to the continental treasury, your alertness in taking money out of the same tresaury for state purposes, has distinguishd you far beyond any State in the Union. This fact will appear most clearly from the following view drawn from the journals of Congress. Monies drawn out of the treasury of the U.S. In the By year 1776 1778 1779 1780 Total 1775  N.

Yet these States are to redeem a fi[f]th more than you. If we take the middle of each year for reducing the Sums taken in them respectively, we shall find the whole to amount to--1,152,848 hard dollars, which you have taken out of the United Treasury; and you boast of having put into it 100,000.  The error then of the Addressers seems to be this--that they have claimd a general pre-eminence of merit, during the whole war, from   having contributed a little more money than most of the States in the Union, during the last year of the war. But surely you will allow it to be just, that when such comparisons are drawn, they shoud flow from a view of the sum total of the Contributions of each State in--Men, Money, & Specifics, during the whole war, deducting the monies they drew from the common fund.  When you are forming this estimate, I hope you will not forget, what I know from having servd in that campaign, that at the close of the year 1776, when the Enemy threatnd immediately your State and your City, the State of Virginia alone furnishd two thirds of the Troops, which enabled our illustrious General, to execute an enterprize against the Enemy's posts in the Jerseys, repelld the danger from you at that time & gave an ascendency to our military reputation which it never lost. Had we then depended on the boasted exertions of a City, containing forty thousand Inhabitants, free of their fortunes & their lives, as the Address says, the fact shews that--in the most pressing danger to themselves & to the Union, they woud hardly have furnishd Regulars enough to have attackd a Picket of the Enemy. Yet we see, that in the same year your State drew from the public treasury--1,035,000 dlls--when paper-money was little if at all depritiated. I shall not repeat the reasons that were then given, for your not making more adequate exertions. The[y] did no honor to your patriotism. It was a misfortune that revolution principles prevaild so little among you. But surely you shoud have had more modesty, remembering those circumstances, than to have boasted, that you were distinguishd for doing, what you were in fact distinguishd for not doing. I perceive that you will attempt to draw some source of defence, from the payments you have made since the close of the year 1782, which I am informd exceed those of any other State. But let it be rememberd, that the preeminence which the residence of Congress gave you in the eyes of Europe, drew almost the whole of the foreign trade to your City on the cessation of hostilities; insomuch that it is matter of common notoriety that in a few months, the duty of 2 per Ct on Imports, brot into your treasury fifty thousand pounds. So that the whole of your contribution very little exceeds the produce of a single tax.  The same cause drew to you many rich Emigrants, who have deposited large sums of specie in that Bank, which the public money raisd in your City for your sole emolument. The States ought to order an enquiry by what authority so partial a use was made of the public money, while several of them were laid waste by the Enemy for want of Arms, & Ammunition to repel them--while the troops to the southward were destitute of Cloathing--& recruiting their lines, was for that reason renderd impracticable.   Having now fulfilld the purpose with which I addressd you, Gentlemen, I shall take my leave with recommending to you that modesty without which even merit loses its lustre & its beauty.

  Dear Sir, Princeton, October 16, 1783. Our joint Letter which your Excellency will receive with this, contains all the material Information I am able to communicate, and I believe you will think it a little strange to find it principally the same in substance & verbatim with mine of last week. It is owing to this Circumstance: some Time before, I mentioned the propriety of writing a joint Letter, but having no Expectation of its being done I wrote a separate one, since which it was proposed to me to prepare an official Letter; in which I inserted so far as related to the Communications from our ministers at the Court of France, the words of my last Letter (having a Copy of the same by me.) I trust this will be a sufficient apoligy as I did not choose to mention my having wrote on that subject before. I have been favoured with Colo. Benson's Letter of the 5th, wrote by your Excellency's Direction. Your observations respecting the Lands at Oriskeny are in my Opinion very just. I shall call on Governor Livingston on my Return, tho' I have no Expectation of making any Bargain with him.(1) I expect to leave Congress the last of this week or the Beginning of next. The Season is so far advanced that unless I am very soon at Home I shall not be able to remove to Long Island with my Family till next Spring. Mr. Duane will tarry till the first of next month, and I trust the state will, considering my present Circumstances, excuse my leaving the State unrepresented a few Days, especially as there will be Ten States represented after I am gone. I expect to return by the way of Dobbs Ferry as the nighest Road without going thro' New York.  OCTOBER 16, 1783  General Washington told me yesterday that he expected the Evacuation of New York would take Place about the Middle of next Month, Mr. Parker having been informed by Sir Guy that he should leave the City about that Time. It is yet undetermined where Congress will Reside for the Winter. There is so great an aversion to return to Philadelphia, even for a temporary Residence, by the New England States, that it is doubtful whether they will not remain here or go to Trenton, notwithstanding the inconvenient winter Accommodations in either Place.  I conclude your Excellency is on the Recovery from your long and dangerous Illness, and hope you will be able to go into New York on the Evacuation where I expect to have the Pleasure of seeing you sometime in the Winter.  With the greatest Esteem & Regard I am, Sir, Your Excellcys Most Obed. Servt. Ezra L'Hommedieu.

  Dear Sir, Princeton, October 16, 1783.  We should before this Time have transmitted to Your Excellency the  OCTOBER 16, 1783  material Parts of the Communications Congress have lately received from the Ministers of the United States at Paris, had they not been under an Injunction of Secrecy till lately, on Account of their being under a Commitment. In their joint Letter of the 16th [i.e., 18th] of July the preliminary Articles and their Reasons for concluding them are explained.(1) They observe that the British Minister were very unwilling to make use of any Terms that might give uneasiness to the refugee Tories, and that the words for restoring the Property of real british Subjects were well understood & apertained between them not to mean or comprehend American Refugees. Mr. Fitzherbert and Mr. Oswell, they say, know this to have been the Case & will readily confess and admit it. They observe it was a more delicate mode of excluding the Refugees and making a proper Distinction between them & the subjects of Britain whose only particular Interest in America consisted in holding Lands & Property.  They think the 6th Article declaring that no future Confiscation should be made & ought to have fixed the Time with greater Certainty, and the most fair Construction is, that it relates to the Date of the Cessation of Hostilities, as, they say, \""That is the Time when Peace in fact took Place in consequence of prior informal tho' binding Contracts to terminate the war.\"" They consider the definitive Treaties as only giving the Dress of Form to those Contracts and not as constituting the Obligation of them: they observe that had the Cessation of Hostilities been the Effect of a Truce and consequently nothing more than a temporary suspension of War another Construction would have been the right one. They say Mr. Heartley had officially assured them that positive Orders for the Evacuation of New York had been dispatched, and that no avoidable Delay would retard that Event; that had they proposed to fix a Time for it, the British Ministry would have contended that it should be a Time posterior to the Date of the definitive Treaty and would probably have been more disadvantageous to us than as that Article now stands. They are surprised to hear that any Doubts have arisen in America respecting the Time when the Cessation of Hostilities took Place there and say, \""It most certainly took place at the Expiration of one month after the Date of that Declaration in all Parts of the World whether Land or Sea that lay north of the Latitude of the Canaries. The Ships afterwards taken from us in the more northwardly Latitudes ought to be reclaimed\"" and given up, & say, they shall apply to Mr. Heartley, on this Subject, and also on that of the Transportation of Negroes from New York contrary to the Words and Intention of the provisional Articles.  At present there is no Probability of a commercial Treaty's being agreed on between the United States and Great Britain. The Powers engaged in the late War have agreed to sign the definitive Treaty together, which has hitherto been principally delayed on account of   the United States, France & Spain having been ready to sign for some Time past. It is not now expected that our Ministers can obtain any other beneficial Articles than those contained in the preliminary Treaty & that in so many words. The definitive will now probably be soon concluded. Six or Seven different Powers in Europe have signified to our Ministers their Desire of entering into commercial Treaties with the United States. Congress have finally concluded that their Place of Residence shall be near the Falls of Trenton. We used our Endeavours to draw the Attention of Congress to the State of New York agreably to the Views of the Legislature expressed in their Resolves at their last meeting, but we found them vain; Connecticut being the only State from which we received any support. Thus disappointed we thought it our Duty to give our Suffrage for the Place now agreed on in preference to another much more remote and inconvenient, George Town on the Potomac.  The Southern States are still much dissatisfied that the federal Town is not more South, holding up the Idea of Centrality as the only just Rule of determination, Hence they supported the Ideas of Potowmac & complain of being overborn by the weight of States & not the Force of Justice. Princetown is found on Experience to be incapable of accomodating Congress alone exclusive of our public officers and foreign Ministers a Temporary Residence is, therefore, to be fixed upon for the Winter Season, and Trenton to be put in order for the Reception of Congress in the Spring.  We were not a little surprised lately to hear the Delegates for the Massachusetts seriously mention on the floor of Congress the Claim of that State to the western Lands in the state of New York, and declare they had Instructions from their State on every Occasion to assert that Claim, and prevent any Act of Congress from passing which might be construed in favour of the Title of New York in preference to that of the Massachusetts.(2) There is no doubt but they will embarrass the Measures our state may judge expedient, where the Interposition of Congress is necessary either in making Peace with the Indians or securing our Frontiers. As soon as an Opportunity presents it will be the Interest of the State to put an End to their Claims by commencing a Suit agreably to the Articles of the Confederation; and in the mean time to use the most vigorous Efforts for settling this Country under their Authority, for no respect ought to be paid to a State Pretention which has laid dormant more than One Hundred & fifty Years. No answer has been given to Sir Guy Carleton's Letter published in the Philadelphia Newspapers (by his direction as is supposed.)3 If the matter of that Letter had not been exceptionable, nor the Terms made use of disrespectful, Congress would not have readily entered   into a Correspondence with him. A Report has been made in Consequence of that Communication which has for a long Time lain on the Table; it respects the Publication of the Ratification of the preliminary Articles by the United States, but so many difficulties have arisen on this Subject, that the Proclamation is yet delayed.(4) By the last Accounts from New York, which appear to come from good Authority there is reason to believe the Evacuation of that City will take place sometime the next month. Sir Guy Carlton has sent a verbal message to our Commander in Chief, by Mr. Parker that his Troops will embark in all the month of November.(5)  We have the Honour to be with the utmost Respect, Sir, Your Excellency's most obedient & very humble Servants.

  Dear Hannah Thursday Oct 16. 1783 I have not received a line from you since that by the stage on Monday. I hope however you are well. Nothing is yet done with regard to the temporary residence and I begin to be afraid we shall be tied down for the winter to this uncomfortable village, notwithstanding eight states have resolved \""that for the more convenient transaction of the business of the United States and accommodation of Congress it is expedient for them to adjourn from their present residence.\""(1) Yesterday for the first time since their removal from Philadelphia they seriously entered upon the business of the Continent and finished a very important matter relative to Indian Affairs.(2) But notwithstanding this I have little hopes of seeing the affairs of the Union in a happy train. You will see in the Packet of the 14th, under the Providence head, an extract of a letter from an American Minister dated Passy June 28 1783. The design of the Correspondent who furnished the extract is evidently to delude his constituents (3) and to induce a belief that our  OCTOBER 16, 1783  credit is high in Europe notwithstanding the noncompliance of the states with the five percent impost. He knows in his conscience this is false. He had other letters from the ministers in his possession which shew that our credit is at a low ebb and that unless measures are speedily taken for establishing permanent funds for the regular payment of the interest and gradual discharge of the principal of the sums we have borrowed in Europe, it will quickly be totally annihilated & these rising states covered with infamy & disgrace if not involved in new & serious troubles. Had he meant to serve the true interest of his country he would have supplied his constituents with these extracts. But truth is not his object nor is it his wish to promote fOEderal measures. What then are we to expect while such men are sent to represent a state in the Union? Had this been the first instance of this correspondents disingenuity and disregard to truth, charity might lead one to think he was only mistaken, but when it is only a repetition of former mean tricks, when on another occasion he deceived his constituents with false information and desired to be furnished with extracts from a letter to gloss his lies, and a copy of the whole letter was delivered to him, instead of sending forward the letter which would have given a true state of facts he selected some detached scraps & sentences, sent them forward and left the letter on the table, it would be an insult on common sense to suppose him actuated by proper principles.(4) I need not press you to write as often as you can and to inform me of what is passing in town, as you know how agreeable your letters are to, Dear Hannah, your affectionate Husband, Cha Thomson ""

  Dear Hannah Friday 17 Oct 1783. The 17 of October is at length arrived, the day on which I hoped Congress would have returned. But I confess the prospect is as dark &  OCTOBER 17, 1783  gloomy as the morning is lowering. The underhand workings of the members seem in some manner to resemble the mountain in Germany mentioned in a late paper. Inward grumblings are heard; The head is covered with clouds & darkness. Vapours burst through apertures which destroy the trees and herbage and every thing denotes an approaching irruption which may involve the neighbourhood in one common ruin and calamity. I think I mentioned in a former letter that in order to engage the Southern States not to vote for a temporary residence in Philadelphia the eastern members had it in contemplation to propose two places for erecting buildings for the residence of Congress, one in the southern & one in the eastern or middle states. Mr. Gerry who has taken an active lead in this business, yesterday broached the matter and moved to have it considered but was prevented by a call for the Order of the day.1 If the public treasury was full of money or if the public debts were paid, or funds provided for discharging them or even for the regular payment of the interest, one might hear such projects with patience. But in the present state of affairs to talk of building cities, when they can scarcely furnish money to buy paper on which to draw a plan of them, when they must be convinced that upon the Superintendant's quitting his office the few hopes that are kept together for the defence of west point and for guarding the public stores and magazines must disperse for want of provisions, the public creditors must go unpaid & the civil officers retire or serve the public at their own expense, Or in such a situation so pointedly to express their resentment against a city & state from which they have heretofore derived such assistance in money transactions appears to me something different from wisdom, prudence or policy. I am much mistaken if at this moment we are not puppets in the hands of the juggling politicians of Europe. Were I to hazard a conjec-ture it would be that G Britain in delaying the definitive treaty & restricting our commercial intercourse, has it in view to conclude the war by the provisional articles, to disunite us from France and by a future commercial treaty separate and apart to draw us into a close and intimate Union with Britain. For this reason I do not expect any definitive treaty soon, other than a ratification of the provisional treaty. And I shrewdly suspect that G.B. will endeavour to weaken the bonds of Union between the states, by offers of different terms in trade and commerce to different states or parts of the Union. Divide and conquer was an old maxim with politicians. And in my Opinion it would be prudent in the states when they quit their arms not to forget the motto, Join or die, which was at the beginning of this contest displayed on so many of their colours.  I received your letter of Wednesday by yesterday's stage and am glad to find you are in good health. I wish you could pay a particular attention to Mrs. Washington while in town. I find Mrs. Peters has invited   her to dine. Could you not make a party & give her an invitation. I am glad you received my letters. They are written with freedom and I should be sorry any of them fell into improper hands.  Adieu my dear Hannah. Take care of your health. I am with sincere affection, your loving husband, Cha Thomson ""

  Sir, Princeton October the 19th. 1783.  In our last we informed your Excellency that the definitive treaties between the late belegerent powers tho the most important points had been adjusted, were none of them compleated on the 27th of July. We shall now endeavour to state some of the reasons respecting ours.  Our Ministers had endeavoured to insert some commercial stipulations in our Treaty and the British Ministers partly through negli- OCTOBER 19, 1783  gence since they have heard our ports are open, or through indecision occasioned by ignorance of the subject have apparently studied to avoid it. They knew not how far the British acts of navigation ought to be sacrificed to commercial considerations drawn from peculiar circumstances of the present crisis. They say virtual & substantial recriprocity they are willing to give, that literal receprocity is impossible as much from our engagements as from their system of navigation. We want the substance and not the shadow, which we take virtual & substantial recriprocity to be, and as there is not at present a disposition to give it to us, Our Ministers seem to be of opinion to drop all commercial articles & leave every thing of that kind to a future special treaty to be made either in Europe or america as Congress may think fit to order.  That you may clearly understand the ideas the British Ministry entertain respecting our commerce with their West India Islands, We send you the following extract of a Letter from a confidential person to the president of Congress.(1) \""On the 8th of August I waited on Lord North & desired his Opinion of the proclamation respecting our Commerce with their West India Islands;(2) he with great apparent candour told me that the proclamation and the principle on which it was formed, would undoubtedly be adhered to, during the continuance of the act of Parliament under which it was issued; that Parliament must then determine respecting future measures, that he could not presume to know what that determination might be though it seemed to him probable, that the same system & principles would be adopted, and continued, that the navigation act had been the nourse and the support of the British naval power, and must not be infringed without urgent necessity, that he was desirous of supporting a good understanding with the United States by all means compatable with the interest of Great Britain, but that the americans after making themselves independent were unreasonable in desiring preveledges, which never had been granted to any independent people, especially as they appeared to have, neither the inclination nor the ability to give any adequate advantages to Great Britain in return. I intimated my opinion of a probability that the United states would retaliate and in consequence of their being deprived of the preveledge of carrying their own produce to the British islands would prevent its being done by British vessels; to which his Lordship replied, that the United States had doubtless the right to adopt such a measure, but in so doing they would necessarily deprive themselves of the best & indeed the only sufficient market for their produce, obstruct the growth, agriculture & commerce of their own country, and injure themselves much more that they would injure Great Britain whose west-india Colonies had been able to subsist during the late war, without supplies from the United states and might do it much better hereafter, by those which   they could be able to obtain from Ireland, Canada, Nova Scotia & St. Johns, that these supplies might indeed cost something more than those which the United States could furnish, and that the West Indian planters might perhaps complain, as men usually do against what hurts their own particular interest, but that he could not think such complaints of any importance in a matter so essential to the existance of the British navigation, that in War Great Britain was exposed to much expence and difficulty in defending her West Indian Colonies, and at all times gave them exclusively the benefits of her markets depriving herself in their favor of the advantages of purchasing sugar &c of other countries and thereby enabling British West indian planters to obtain higher prices for their produce than the planters of any other nation, and that unless Great Britain in return for these favors, could exclusively enjoy the benefits of their navigation, it would in his private opinion be much better to let them become independent like the United states. His Lordship further observed that he had no expectation of a commercial treaty with the United states at least for a considerable time that indeed he saw no great reason to desire it Congress having so little power or influence that if a treaty was concluded, the several States probably would not ratify or observe it.\""  Congress have this matter now before them (3) and if the proclamation cannot be set aside but should be persisted in, it will then become a matter worthy their attentive discussion whether it will be most prudent to retort with a similar regulation in order to force its repeal, or to let it pass without notice & leave it to its own inconvenience, or rather impracticability in the execution, and to the complaints of the West india planters, who must all pay much dearer for our produce under those restrictions. We are not master enough of this subject to give an opinion on this particular question, yet we have heard of so much embarrassment and so little advantage in all the restraining & compulsive systems that we feel ourselves strongly inclined to believe that a State which leaves all her ports open to all the world upon equal terms, will by that means have foreign commodities cheaper, sell its own productions dearer and be on the whole the most prosperous. Employing however, of our own ships & raising a breed of seamen among us, tho' it should not be a matter of so much private profit as some suppose is nevertheless of political importance and must have weight in considering this subject.  France we expect will aid us in establishing our commerce as she did our independence, the character of that Court and nation seems of late years to be considerably changed. Her ideas of agrandizement by conquest, are out of fashion; and those of commerce are more enlightened and more generous than heretofore. We shall soon, we believe, feel something of this in our being admitted to a greater freedom of trade with their Islands. The wise there think France great   enough, its ambition at present seems to be only that of Justice & magnanimity towards other Nations, fidelity and utility to its allies.  We observed formerly, that whenever the definitive Treaty may arrive there is not the least reason to believe that it will contain a single explanation or provision more than is contained in the prelimanary articles. By this we meant a Verbatim Transcript of the provisional articles with the necessary alterations of preamble &c. You no doubt will be surprised at this as in some things they are absolutely so ambiguous as not to be understood. The Secretary for foreign affairs pointed out some of them or all to our Ministers, and made some strictures on the manner of transacting the negotiations: to which they reply.(4)  \""We are happy to find that the provisional articles have been approved & ratified by Congress, and we regret that the manner in which that business was conducted does not coincide with your ideas of propriety. We are persuaded however that this is principally owing to your being necessarily unacquainted with a number of circumstances known to us who were on the spot and which will [be] particularly explained to you hereafter, and, we trust to your satisfaction and that of Congress. \""The 6th article Vizt. where it declares that no future confiscations shall be made &ca. ought to have fixed that time with greater accuracy. We think the most fair and true construction is, that it relates to the date of the cessation of Hostilities. That is the time when peace in fact took place in consequence of prior informal tho' binding contracts to terminate the war. We consider the definitive Treaties as only giving the dress to those contracts and not as constituting the obligation of them. Had the cessation of hostilities been the effect of a truce and consequently nothing more than a temporary suspension of war, another construction would have been the true one. \""We are officially assured by Mr. Hartley that positive orders for the evacuation of New York have been despatched, and that no avoidable delay will retard that event. Had we proposed to fix a time for it the British Court would have contended that it should be a time posterior to the date of the Definitive Treaty, and that would have been probably more disadvantageous to us than as that article now stands.  \""We are surprised to hear that any doubts have arisen in America respecting the time when the cessation of Hostilities took place there. It most certainly took place at the expiration of one month after the date of that declaration in all parts of the World whether land or sea that lay North of the Latitude of the Canaries the ships afterwards taken from us in the more Northwardly latitude ought to be reclaimed & given up: we shall apply to Mr. Hartly on this subject, and also, on that of the transportation of Negroes from New York contrary to the Words and intention of the provisional articles.\""   Doctor Franklin further observes there are no doubt, certain ambiguities in our Articles, but it is not to be wondered at, when it is considered how exceedingly averse Britain was to expressions which explicitly wounded the Tories, and how disinclined we were to use any that should amount to absolute stipulations in their favour.  The words for restoring the property of Real British subjects were well understood & explained between us not to mean or comprehend American refugees. Mr. Ozwald & Mr Fitzs Herbert know this to have been the case and will readily confess and admit it. This mode of expression was prefered by them as a more delicate mode of excluding those refugees and of making a proper distinction between them and the subjects of Britain whose only particular interest in America consisted in holding Lands or property there.  As soon as it is practicable further observations on this subject shall be forwarded, at present we are not sufficiently informed to give that satisfaction we wish and you have a right to expect. We expect that an attestation of the ratification of the Treaty by order of Congress, will be sent forward to the respective States with a Letter explanatory of the conduct of Congress respecting it. Until then we shall not say any thing further.  The Commercial Treaty with Sweden will be sent forward by the next post, we hoped to be able to send it by this conveyance, but altho' it was printed last week some accident hath prevented our receiving the Copies from Philadelphia.(5) Sir Guy Carleton has informed the Commander in chief that he expects to be able to evacuate New York within the month of November.(6) Congress yesterday passed a proclamation for disbanding all our officers & soldiers who were on furlough,(7) our whole army now is only sufficient to Garrison West Point.  Our situation begins to be very disagreeable, we are now, and have been for sometime without one shilling of money, and the prospects formerly held out to us have vanished; Our Colleagues are not yet arrived, and we know not now when to expect them. The Treasurers of all the States in the Union except North Carolina, regularly send forward monthly the salary of their Delegates; we depend on borrowing for our decent support, and fear very shortly that our credit will be like the remittances from our state. How far this will comport with the dignity of a Sovereign State we leave the chief Magistrate to judge.  Be pleased to present our dutiful respects to the General Assembly, assure them of our most faithful services, and believe us to be with great & sincere esteem, Sir Your Excellency's &c.

It was in vain urged by the middle states that the measure was important & deserved serious deliberation, that the precipitancy with which it was about to be carried was unusual and unprecedented, that the moving without any just or solid reason to bring on a matter which the day before they had agreed to postpone for a few Days to give members time to deliberate was uncandid, especially as on the assurance & faith of that vote several members had gone out of town, particularly a member from Pen-sylvania, by whose absence his state was unrepresented; that such unsteady conduct would reflect dishonor on the public councils of America; That deciding the question on that day could not remove any difficulties out of the way or facilitate the means of receiving the Minister from Holland. If this Congress meant to receive him there were two ways to do it; one was to send for him to this place; the other was to go to a place at no great distance where they could receive him  OCTOBER 19, 1783  properly. The deciding or not deciding on the motion of the member from Massachusetts could have no effect upon the choice of either of these modes. If it was intended, upon carrying the vote for fixing another fOEderal town on Potomack, to adjourn Congress to Annapolis, Members must be sensible that the distance of that place and the shortness of time would put it out of the power of this Congress to receive the Dutch minister. And when the Congress of the United states which is next to assemble will be able to receive him is very uncertain. The times of a great number of members expire with the present month. New Delegates are to be chosen, & some of the states are in such a situation that their legislatures cannot soon be convened. So that there is little prospect of a new Congress meeting for this or any other business till December. All these arguments passed unanswered, saving only that it was observed, that the presence or absence of Pensylvania was of no importance in the present case. The vote could & would be carried if it was present notwithstanding a negative; that notice was given of the motion intended to be made for a reconsideration, the member for Pensylvania heard it and if he thought the vote of his state of importance he might have tarried; other gentlemen as well as he had business which required them to be absent and their tarrying here was very inconvenient. The question therefore was insisted on. When it was about to be put, the delegates for New Jersey in right of their state, agreeably to the rules of the house, required that the determination thereof should be put off till Monday next. And thus that matter now Stands.(2) Congress yesterday passed two proclamations, one for setting apart the second thursday in December next as a day of public thanks giving, and the other for disbanding all that part of the Army which had been furloughed,(3) so that there now remains in the service of the United states only those that are at West Point & the few at Philada. which by the bye have no business there, and I am astonished the state remains silent on that subject.  But I am wandering from my subject. You see, my dear, what it is to have a politician for a husband. Instead of love letters you are only to be entertained with business or politics. I confess my mind has been lately much agitated and I have deliberated very seriously on my future plan of life. My comfort and happiness greatly depends upon being with you. I have devoted so much of my life to, and spent so many anxious hours, or rather years, in the public service without emolument, that I thought I might upon the return of peace and the attainment of those blessings for which we contended, continue to enjoy the profits arising from my Office, especially as the office is necessary and I flatter myself I should not be unserviceable to my country in the exercise of it. Nevertheless rather than be separated from you I would relinquish it, as I can now do it with honor and the cause of America will suffer no detriment, and I can do it with the less regret,  OCTOBER 20, 1783  as I am sensible that my continuance in Office will be constantly attended by envy though not with so much anxiety as I have heretofore experienced and that a small fault is sufficient to obliterate the Merit of many years faithful services. But I must premise that when I retire it will not be to ease and affluence. I must attend to some business for our support. However as our wants are not many and our expenses not very great, I think by attention to our farms we may live decently without much trouble or uneasiness of mind.  I have not had any answer about the purchase I made from Mr. Lawrence. I fancy they have taken the chance of the public sale. If it there brings more, the answer I shall receive will be that the letter from Mr. Lawrence had miscarried or did not come in time & if less, then I may have it. Be it as it may, I am satisfied.  I think you had as well get the rooms papered. I do not think it can ever be done cheaper. The expence will be trifling. If you should have occasion for money make use of that received last. If Haddock calls for the price of the pipe, you will please to pay him and get him to put a cock into it near the pump to stop the water in the winter. I am sorry to give you trouble, but would be glad if you could have the wine racked off. Jonathan or Robert will at your desire get a cooper to do it. Monday morning. I have nothing to add, but my most sincere wishes for your health and happiness and that I am with unfeigned affection, your loving husband, Cha Thomson ""

  Dear Hannah, Monday Evening Oct 20. 1783  As you must be anxious to know the result of this day's debate, I sit down to give you some account of it. The debates and proceedings beggar all description and the issue was fruitless. I informed you in my last that the question for reconsidering the vote which had postponed Mr. Gerrys motion to Wednesday was put off on Saturday by the state of New Jersey. It was therefore taken up this morning and all debates being precluded by the rules of the house, it was carried in the Affirmative by seven states. The vote for postponing to Wednesday which now came before the house was negatived, and the motion of Mr. Gerry was taken into Consideration.1 Peters was gone to Philadelphia, Clarke was confined to his bed by sickness & Condict was absent. So that there were only eight states represented & of these there were three of the eastern and four of the southern, it was therefore expected that the motion for another fOEderal town would be carried with ease and without much opposition. Mr. Montgomery who is inexperienced in the art of speaking, and has little command of the powers of Oratory had committed some thoughts to writing which he read and explained in a plain but very feeble manner. This offered an easy triumph to Mr. Gerry, who immediately rose to answer him. And though he is far from being distinguished for his talents in Oratory, and cannot boast of the thunder of his voice, the harmony of his periods or any of those high strokes of eloquence which transport and captivate the hearers, nor of a just arrangement of arguments or soft insinuating address which commands the attention of an Audience and leads them insensibly and almost involuntarily to the point he means to carry, yet with his feeble voice and uncouth delivery broken and interruped with many a heck & hem & repetition of ofs & ands he assumed such a superiority over Montgomery & treated his Arguments with such disdain as called up Duane, who enforced Montgomery's Argument & stated his own objections to the measure with great art, force and energy. But reasoning was lost and eloquence vain. The matter had been settled out of doors, and only waited the formality of a vote. The question was therefore called for. But just when it seemed ready to be put Mr. Howell got up and said he was not prepared to vote. He wanted first to have the temporary residence  OCTOBER 20, 1783  fixed. He was afraid after this vote was carried that Congress would be hurried away to Philadelphia; that it was to avoid this that he had agreed to give his vote for another fOEderal town. He wished to be secured in this point, then he would be ready to give his vote. This objection at this stage of the business seemed to be quite unexpected and gave a new turn to the debates. It appeared evident that though the matter had been settled out of doors yet when it came to the point of decision they began to distrust each others sincerity and could not rely on each others candor. Their whole attention was therefore turned to the restoring mutual Confidence. For this purpose Mr Carroll proposed to tack a sentence to the motion, to empower & direct the president on a certain day to adjourn congress to meet at Annapolis there to sit for the dispach of public business till the 31 of October following. This did not satisfy the eastern members as it threw the place of residence on Delaware wholly out of view. He therefore proposed to alter his motion to the 15 of October following & to add that on that day the president should be empowered & directed to adjourn congress to meet at Trenton the 31 of that month and that the sessions should be alternately 12 months at Annapolis & 12 months at Trenton till the buildings were erected in the two fOEderal towns & fit for the reception of Congress. The term of 12 months did not please Ellery, he wanted it to be confined to 6 and declared he could not give his assent without that alteration. On the other hand Mr. Izard declared that he would not agree to a shorter term than 12 months and as the assent of both was necessary Carroll who was deeply interested in the vote withdrew his motion & said he would trouble himself no farther in the matter. He appeared to be extremely mortified. Gerry then undertook to draw up a conciliating motion & for this purpose that the residence should be alternately at equal periods of not more than one year nor less than six months in Trenton & Annapolis until the buildings to be erected on the banks of the Delaware and Potomack should be prepared for the reception of Congress. Upon this Ellery moved to strike out the words \""one year nor less than\"" so as to confine the residence to a term of not more than 6 mo. And as by the rules of the house the question must be stated \""shall the words stand,\"" and the votes of seven states were necessary to keep them in, his single negative was sufficient to remove them. However for the sake of conciliation his collegue (2) & the state of Massachusetts joined him in the vote and the words were struck out. Upon this a motion was made to strike out the remaining words \""of not more than 6 months\"" and reduce Gerry's conciliatory motion to the simple proposition of residing alternately at equal periods in Trenton & Annapolis, which was accordingly done; but in that state it did not meet the approbation of Ellery & for want of his vote it was lost.(3) Howell was now reduced to his former difficulty & declared he could not give his consent to the Orig-  inal motion. This threw all into confusion, from debate and argument they proceeded to reproaches & altercation. The middle states not less pleased than surprized at this sudden and unexpected turn stood by silent spectators and enjoyed the confusion. As it was now near sunset & Mercer who was agitated in a high degree was proceeding to lay open the whole scene of this secret transaction with some severe reflections on the disingenuity and want of candour in the eastern members, and as all hopes of an accommodation were now at an End, an adjournment was called for which put an end to further dispute & thus for the present the project of another fOEderal town is vanished in air. The fall of the south sea stocks hardly gave a greater shock to the proprietors than the bursting of this bubble to its projectors. The southern members now declare that they will vote for the temporary residence at Philada. But I question whether they will adhere to this when they cool. I am rather inclined to think matters will rest as they are till the new Congress meets.  Adieu my dear Hannah, take care of your health & remember me to all friends. I am with sincere affection, your loving husband, Cha Thomson Molly comes to invite to breakfast & desires me always to send her love to you. Tuesday morning Oct 21. 1783 P.S. Notwithstanding the defeat of yesterday I understand the eastern and So. States are rallying their forces & mean this morning to bring on the subject again & for that purpose Mr. Izard is detained in town. I fancy some new convention is entered into. There is no possibility of conjecturing with any degree of certainty what may be the event. The jarring atoms may for a time be combined, even grains of sand will by being wet for awhile adhere, but the cohesion will not be lasting. C.T. ""

  Dear Hannah, Tuesday Evening Oct 21. 1783 The dye is cast. The vote is taken and carried for a second fOEderal town and for the removal of Congress to Annapolis.(1) Time must determine the wisdom or impolicy of the measure. For my own part to use an expression of lord Botetourt (2) I augur no good of it. Agreeably to what I mentioned in my postscript of this morning,(3) the eastern delegates after Congress broke up yesterday got together and came to an agreement, upon which Mr. Izard was detained in town, And this morning as soon as the journals & dispatches were read, the motion of Mr. Gerry was revived. Whereupon Ellery got up and informed the house, that he found himself disposed to accommodate and with that view would move an Amendment, which was accordingly made & sec- OCTOBER 21, 1783  onded and quickly passed. It was in vain to oppose, the measure was determined on and argument was useless: The opposing members therefore contented themselves with silent votes in the negative. There were only eight states present, and as soon as the vote was carried Mr. Izard withdrew & seven only were left, a number inadequate by the articles of confederation to any great national purposes. And much I fear the number will not soon be augmented. The jarring interests of the states appear almost in every question.  The Indian nations with whom we have lately been at war having signified their desire of peace, instructions were drawn up for the direction of those who should meet & confer with them.(4) There are several gentlemen who were appointed Commissioners for Indian affairs in 1775 and who have ever since held all the conferences and managed all business with the Indians. Among these commissioners are genl. Schuyler and Mr. Douy of the state of New York.(5) These gentlemen being Newyorkers are obnoxious to the Eastern states. It was therefore proposed to elect new commissioners for managing the ensuing treaty. And Mr. Gerry who seems to be used as the instrument for setting this continent in a flame, among other arguments mentioned the necessity and propriety of Massachusetts having men in the commission in whom she could confide as she claimed all the lands to the westward, the whole breadth of her state across New York and to the utmost extent of the boundary of the United states; and that he was under instructions to support that claim & to oppose every measure in Congress that had the least tendency to invalidate it. This you may well imagine alarmed the delegates of New York. Mr. Duane replied with warmth and some acrimony. It was very strange he said if Massachusetts had such a claim to the lands in the state of New York that she should suffer it to be so long dormant. That the state of New York had been in the possession of the lands now claimed for more than 150 years. Why was it not brought forward and settled agreeably to the articles of Confederation while common danger kept the states united. Was it reserved to this time that after New York had wasted her best blood and treasure and debilitated herself by her exertions in the common cause advantage might be taken of her weakness and the longest sword decide the controversy? He remarked on the ungenerous treatment New York had received from the eastern states in the affair of Vermont. That while she was surrounded with enemies and exerting her whole force to repel common danger they were laying schemes to raise up enemies in her bowels and to enrich themselves with her spoil. Rhodeisland thought she should have a commissioner to manage her interests at the ensuing treaty as she had a right to a share of the western country. Maryland also put in her claim. In short the whole scene was an illustration of the fable of the hunters quarreling about the bear skin, before they had killed the   bear. It was at last proposed that two commissioners should be chosen from each state. This was to me another strong symptom of the approaching dissolution of the Union. Nothing however was decided. I suppose it will be a subject of debate tomorrow.  I must now think seriously of my future plan of life. I want to consult & advise with you. But am afraid I shall not be able to go down before the dissolution of this wise Congress. Mr. Bond informs me he intends to quit the Office on friday. I would have you nevertheless proceed to have the rooms &c entry papered and should be glad you would speak to Griffits to fit up a place for our carriage. By this you will perceive I have received your letter of Sunday. Enclosed I send you a copy of the resolution passed today.6 I wish I could say I had even the smallest or most distant prospect of the salutary effects held forth in the preamble. I confess I have not the least. However we have seen great events and we have experienced an unseen hand guiding us to them. All may terminate well.  \""The ways of providence are dark and intricate  \""Puzled in mazes and perplexed in errors \""Our understanding traces them in vain\""(7) Let me therefore conclude with the pious poet  \""Je crains mon Dieu, que j'aye ne point d'autre crain.\""(8) Adieu my dear Hannah, take care of your health.

I this moment received your favour of the 4th instant, and am much obliged by your polite attention to me. It is particularly unfortunate for us that we are so situated as to be compelled to be troublesome to our friends, and not likely ever to have it in our power to render them any adequate compensation in return for their favours. This too while we are employed transacting the business of a State from which we have a right to expect ample support. You know too well, where the blame lies, and therefore I need not refresh your memory.  Mr. Hillbourn has shewn me great marks of civility I believe at the request of your brother, as it was through him or Mr. Blackledge I became acquainted with that very honest gentleman, If he should have received the letter you mention from Mr. Blackledge, I shall immediately be informd thereof.  Congress have Resolved to erect buildings for their use on the banks of the Delaware and Potowmac and to move to Annapolis for their residence the resolutions are, Resolved,(2) that Buildings for the use of Congress be erected on or near the banks of the Delaware provided a suitable district can be procured on or near the banks of the said river for the fOEderal town and that the right of soil and an exclusive or such other jurisdiction as Congress may direct shall be vested in the United States.  Resolved that the place on the Delaware for erecting buildings for the use of Congress be near the falls.  Whereas (3) there is reason to expect that the providing buildings for the alternate residance of Congress in two places will be productive of the most salutary effects by securing the mutual confidence and affection of the States.  OCTOBER 22, 1783  Resolved (4) that builings be likewise erected for the use of Congress at or near the lower falls of Potowmac or Georgetown, provided a suitable district on the banks of the river can be produced for a fOEderal town and the right of soil and an exclusive jurisdiction or such other as Congress may direct shall be vested in the United States and that until the buildings to be erected on the banks of the Delaware and Potowmac shall be prepared for the reception of Congress their residence shall be alternately at equal periods of not more than one year and not less than six months in Trenton and Annapolis, and the president is hereby authorised and directed to adjourn Congress on the 12th day of november next to meet at Annapolis on the twenty sixth of the same month for the dispatch of public business.

The appointment of the only place for their residence at or near Trenton did not give Satisfaction and for want of present accomodations it Seemed necessary to remove to Some other place for their Session the ensuing winter, & was thought essential for the public welfare by most of the delegates to avoid the City of Philadelphia, & all other large Trading Cities in future, & in this Sentiment we presume our constituents fully coincide.

  Dear Hamilton. Princeton 22 Octbr. 1783. I obey you. The homilies you delivered in Congress are still recollected with pleasure. The impressions they made are in favor of your integrity and no one but believes you a man of honor and republican principles. Were you ten years older and twenty thousand pounds richer, there is no doubt but that you might obtain the suffrages of Congress for the highest office in their gift. You are supposed to possess various knowlege, useful--substantial--and ornamental. Your very grave and your cautious--your men who measure others by the standard of their own creeping politics think you sometimes intemperate, but seldom visionary, and that were you to pursue your object with as much cold perseverance as you do with ardor and argument you would become irresistable. In a word, if you could submit to spend a whole life in dissecting a fly you would be in their opinion one of the greatest men in the world. Bold designs--measures calculated for their rapid execution--a wisdom that would convince from its own weight--a project that would surprise the people into greater happiness, without giving them an opportunity to view it and reject it, are not adapted to a council composed of discordant elements, or a people who have thirteen heads each of which pay superstitious adoration to inferior divinities.  I have been deterred from day to day from sending you the extract you desire by a proclamation on the subject which I expected would have passed. It is still in dubio.(1) I have reported on Fleury's case on the principle you recommend.(2) I fear his half pay will not be granted.  OCTOBER 23, 1783  Congress some time ago determined to fix their fOEderal Town on the Delaware near Trenton. Yesterday they determined to erect a second fOEderal Town on the Potomac near George Town--and to reside equal periods (not exceeding one year) at Annapolis & Trenton till the buildings are completed. We adjourn the 12 of next month to meet at Annapolis the 26.  Adieu my dear friend and in the [da]ys of your happiness drop a line to yours James McHenry  Octbr. 23d.

  Dear Sir, Princeton Octr. 23d 1783 I have had this Moment brought in from the Post Office, a very large Bundle or Packett; directed to you in New York. This direction puzzled me much; as from the Appearance of it, I was confident, it was nothing more than News Papers, and yet the direction indicated the Packett being private and the direction being to you as late Secy for foreign Affairs, confirmed the opinion--but on due Consideration, and knowing that the Postage would be enormous, if I suffered them to go on, and being convinced that by opening the outside cover, I might reduce the matter to a certainty, I ventured on your good Nature, so far as to open the outside Cover, and found nothing more than a large Parcel of antiquated news Papers, with 2 or 3 Letters from Mr Dumas, directed to you in your late public Character, and the enclosed Letter from Mr Van Berkel the Dutch Minister to you.(1) The Letters from Mr Dumas were all of a public Nature, so that I believe I have done right, at least if not, I know you will conclude the mistake (if any) to arise from the purest Motives.(2) I am a little surprised that Mr Van Berkel should have such a Pacquet (which from  OCTOBER 23, 1783  the direction, appeared to be expressly on public Service) by the Post, to you at such a distance. This Minister has not yet given Congress the least Intimation of his arrival. He is (it is said) much displeased with his reception at Philadelphia, and especially, at his not having had a House provided for him. He went to the City Tavern, till I heard by a friend that he could not get a House; I have given him the use of mine.

Our public Affairs are truly in a disagreeable Situation--I am heartily tired of my Station and rejoice at my approach to Obscurity. Congress you have doubtless heard, lately determined their Place of residence to be near the falls of Delaware. This Mortified the Southern Members so much, that they have maneuvered in such a manner to take in the Eastern Members so completely, as to get them (Mr Gerry at their Head) to conform entirely to their Views--and taking advantage of the absence of Pennsylvania, Jersy & Delaware, hastily passed a Vote for two Places of residence & fixed the other at or near George Town on the Potowmack, and their temporary residence alternately year about at Annapolis & Trenton till their Buildings are erected. The President is to adjourn Congress on the 12t Nov to Annapolis--So that we are to be in future wandring Stars and to have our Aphelion & Perhalion.  I augur great Evil from this Measure & cannot help thinking of Rome & Constantinople. Massachusetts has lately remonstrated rather warmly to Congress agt the Expence of our Civil List, yet Massachusetts has in this Instance, forced down our Throats a Measure, that will necessarily increase many of the officers of the Civil List at least two fold, as well as add to the Expences of all our Buildings at least double.

It was not obtained in the most candid & generous way, and was finally accomplished by the most heterogeneous Coalition that was in the power of Congress to form.  We have disbanded the Army, except the Garrisons of West Point & Fort Pitt, to take place on the 1st Monday in Novr next, so that I hope you will then have some relief from those Expences.  My Daughter is rather on the recovery, who with Mrs Boudinot join me in the most respectful Compliments. I have the honor to be, Dear Sir, Yours &c. ""

  Dear Sir, Princeton, 23d October, 1783.  It was with very great pleasure that I learned from Mr. R. C. Livingston that your Excellency had got the better of your Fever and was daily gathering strength, permit me most sincerely to solicitate with yourself and your Family on this happy Event.  Since my last, Congress to satisfy the uneasiness of the Southern States have agreed on two federal Towns one near the Head of the Potomack, It renders in my opinion the Falls of Trenton a very improper place for the other and points out the propriety of fixing one of the  OCTOBER 23, 1783  Towns more northerly; probably this subject will be moved before I leave Congress. Mr. Van Borkle is arrived at Philadelphia but has not yet announced himself to Congress, nor do I expect to see him, as it is agreed to adjourn to Annapolis about the time our Delegation expires: that city being fixed for the temporary Residence of Congress till proper buildings for the use of Congress shall be erected: but with this provision, that after a period not longer than a year nor less than six months they shall remove for a like temporary Residence to Trenton: and so alternately to sit at each place till the federal Towns are fit for their Reception. It would be tedious to trace the Causes which produced this project, and unnecessary because I shall soon have the pleasure of detailing them in person.  I took the Liberty to draw upon your Excellency for £100 and am obliged to you for the orders you have given to answer my Request. I had no time to apprize your Excellency of it in form,1 as Mr. Livingston called upon me while I was engaged in a debate in Congress the issue of which I had much at Heart. I hope I may be fortunate enough to receive the money in time to discharge my Bills of Expence and get some Cloaths which the season requires.  With every possible sentiment of Esteem and Respect--I have the Honor to be, Dear Sir, Your Excellency's most obedient & very humble Servant, Jas. Duane.

  Dr Sir, Thursday Eveng [October 23, 1783] (1) Tho' I do not expect to attend Congress Again I am Very Solicitous that some business now before them, should be particularly attended to as I think it of great Importance to the public Interest. I Saw Among the Reports one upon a Letter of Presidt Weare of New Hamshire which if Agreed to would be in direct Contradiction of the System laid down by Congress, (2) & the Example once sett there are other states fond Eno. of following it. We all know that the States even now pay Scarce any thing, but if once Certificates for Interest was taken not one Shilling wd. be paid in any other way. It is a Little Remarkable too that the State this comes from has not paid more than 3000 dollars since the Year 1781. I mentioned the Subject to Mr. Carroll before I came down--it will be well to Explain it to some others before it comes to be debated. The Inclosed paper was sent to me some days Ago, & I Intended Laying it before the house when I was Last up but forgot it. The Villainy of it may not appear to you at first  OCTOBER 23, 1783  Sight, nor will my time Now permit me to Explain it is drawn up by Montgomery & Intended as a reflection Upon the Financier.(3) By the by, I Suspect the Comr. they have here is playing him false.(4) He is a Rhode Island fellow & May be in League with his Countrymen as the paper Must be Layd before Congress. Only got it referred to the Suptd of Finance--he will Make a report on it Which may be laid before the Assembly.  In a report drawg up by Duane there is a resolution to prevent the Loan of any more Mony in Europe & Intended to prevent the Completion of that going on in Holland. If I had not the very Worst Opinion of the designs of some Men among us I could not fear such a resolution passing--because they have Solemnly Engaged to Support the financier--& he depends on that Loan for the fulfillment of his Engagements--but I Acknowledge I do not think some of them too good to break their Engagement, & to risk all the Evils that would follow thereby to Injure him. I Must therefore recommend that matter to you & get you to set the honest part of the house on their Guard Against this one More Rascally attempt. On my return to town I was obliged Imm'y to wait on Mr Van Berkell, who I found not a little disappointed at his Reception. He told me very politely--that the States of Holland, to do honor to their 1st Embassy to the United States had sent their Minister with a respectable fleet, that when Mr. Adams arrived in Holland the states sent a person to receive him, & provided a proper place for his reception. He asked me if there were any houses to be Got: where Congress were for foreign Ministers, & seemed extreamly surprized to hear that there were not--he is yet at the City tavern but will remove to Morrow to the presidents house,(5) & remain there till he can look round him. He Appears to be a very Genteel Sensible man Speaks English well, & to have felt exceedingly What I Imagine he thinks the Neglect that he has been treated with. If we are to pay any regard to the representations of our Ministers this Gent. Might be made very usefull to this Country. I sincerely wish Congress would take his situation into View and Consider whether Something respecting him should not be done by them.  You will See by the papers that the Election for the City & County (6) has gone in favour of the Republicans--but after all when you look at the new members they have not much to pleasure themselves on. There was a Military Manoeuver made use of to get about 150 Soldiers to Vote which has Occasioned some Clamour--as far as we have heard from Chester Matters are gone in the same Line there, Wayne & Judge Evans are Censors. Tell our Fellow Labourer his Name sake (7) is liable to lose his Election by being Run in one place for Censor & the other for Counselor.   This Letter is Like Dean Berkelys treatise that begins with the Trinity & Ends with tarr Water. When I begun it, I thot one half sheet would have held all I had to say & I have run it over With many Interruptions. I am not quite satisfyed with a sentimt that Duane Expressed of me to You--be so good to tell him If I am proud, Congress has made me so. I allways thot myself Indifferently honest but I certainly have been Led to think myself honester than many people there & If I have not allways borne with their Knavery & folly so well as I ought he must Impute it to my Little Knowledge of public Assemblys. I would allways however be glad to distinguish, & If I Ever said any thing offensive to him, it was not Intentional for Except the Little Maneuvrs abt preventg the return of Congress to this place I have always thot him Candid & Very Usefull. Tell my friend Carroll his bill is Accepted & that the Mony shall be at his disposall when he thinks proper. Excuse this Scrawl & believe me Yrs &c. Thos. FitzSimons  ""

  Sir. Princeton 23d October 1783.  I enclose a Copy of a Resolution of Congress for a second foederal Town on the Potomack, at or near George Town; and for adjourning Congress to meet at Anapolis, on the twenty sixth of November next.(1) The reasons of this resolution were, the uneasiness of the southern Delegates at fixing the residence on the Delaware, at, or near the falls above Trenton; and the apprehensions of the Northern States, that no other measures would prove effectual to prevent the return of Congress to Philadelphia, for a temporary residence.  OCTOBER 23, 1783  An authenticated Copy of the provisional Articles, and of the ratification of the same by Congress, is ordred to be transmitted to the respective States:(2) the desire is, that they may take no measures inconsistent with those Articles & which would render the fulfilment thereof impracticable. The Articles themselves do not seem sufficiently explicit. A question may arise, at what period are they to take place in America? whither on the cessation of hostilities in consequence of the proclamation (which was no part of the preliminary Articles) or on the ratification of those Articles in America, or not untill the ratification of the difinitive Treaty, in which the provisional Articles are to be inserted and to constitute part thereof. While we are waiting for the definitive Treaty (which will I hope remove these difficulties) every State will do well to judge in the best manner they can, on the sense of the provisional Articles, and endeavor to do nothing inconsistent with what is therein stipulated on the part of the United States.

In the 9th instant, I had the honor of informing your Excellency, that Congress had determined, that buildings shou'd be erected, for their use, \""at or near the falls of the Delaware\""; but the determination not being satisfactory to the southern states, Congress on Tuesday last resolved that buildings, for their use, should likewise be erected \""at or near the lower falls of Potowmack or Georgetown;\"" and they have also determined that untill said buildings are prepared for their reception, Congress shall sit in Annapolis & Trenton alternately, not exceeding one year at a time in either place, and they have passed a resolution authorizing & directing the President to adjourn Congress on the 12th day of Novr. next, to meet at Annapolis on the 26th of the same month for the dispatch of public business, this seems to give more general satisfaction.(1)  I understand Mr Van Berkel, the Dutch minister is in the City of Phila. but he has not yet made us a visit & I do not expect he will be recd. in his public capacity untill after Congress meets at Annapolis.

  Dear Sir, Princeton August [i.e. October] 23. 1783.(1) In Expectation that some General Questions might be put in a few Days relative to the peace Establishment in which our State might be much interested, I determined to tarry here one week longer than I had proposed to do. At present I see no Prospect of such Establishment being agreed to for some Time, The Business of this week having been to agree upon a Place for a Second fOEderal Town & a Place to which Congress are to adjorn; and it is now resolved that Congress will adjorn the 12th of next month to meet on the 26th Day at Anapolis, & by the same Resolve have agreed that Buildings be erected near George Town near the Potomack for a second federal Town for the Recidens of Congress, as by the inclosed Act appears. The eastern States agreed with the Southern States in this Resolve but upon very different motives.  I beleive but few States will consent to Advance Money for erecting Buildings in Two different Places. If this should be the Case the Act for erecting buildings near the falls of Trenton is Virtually repealed.  Should the States think it necessary to erect Buildings at Two Places, it is likely one of the Places will be further Northward than Trenton. It was yesterday agreed to send the Exemplification of the Preliminary Articles with the act of Ratification to the several States.(2) I expect to leave this Place tomorrow or the next Day (3) so that I may be at Home by the last of the Month which will make the Time of my Attendence in Congress for the present Year, including travilling Days, to be Ninety Two Days.

  Princeton 23 Octbr. [1783] I imagine, you, my dear Peggy, as well as some others, will suspect, that if there is a goddess of caprice, she directs the councils of Congress. Yesterday Congress agreed upon a second fOEderal Town, to be erected at or near George Town on the Potomac; to sit equal periods, not exceeding one year at Trenton & Annapolis, and to adjourn on the 12th of next month to meet at Annapolis on the 26.  The idea of this second fOEderal Town is founded on the satisfaction it will give to the Southern States; and upon its vicinity to and easy communication with the great western Country which is larger than all the settled parts of the united States. In this my Peggy, will find one reason why I was obliged to vote against a return to Philadelphia. A return would have operated, if not defeated this project.

  Gentlemen Princeton 23d October 1783  We had the Honor of addressing You the 16th Instant, & inclosed the proceedings of Congress for negotiating a Peace with the Indians. That no advantage might be taken at the Treaty, to invalidate the Claims of Massachusetts to the western Territory, We have proposed, & shall use our best Endeavours, that each State whose Delegates may require it, shall have a full proportion of its Citizens, to act as Commissioners at the Treaty.(1) We perceive, that when anything is offered in Support of the Claims of Massachusetts, the honble Delegates of New York assert, that there are no such claims, but what have been dormant a Century and an half, & that during that Time, New York has been in possession of the Territory. In answer to these Declarations We should immediately file a protest, or remonstrate against the Proceedings of that State, for granting Part of the contested Lands, but We conceive that such a Step would be premature, untill Massachusetts are prepared for a Decission agreable to the Confederation, & shall authorize the Measure. We have reason to think, that New York will endeavour to carry their Point, by urging a Decission, as  OCTOBER 23, 1783  soon as Circumstances will permit: if then Massachusetts should be unprepared, an advantage may be taken, as Connecticut asserts was the Case, in her Dispute with Pennsylvania.  We enclose the Proceedings of Congress for two fOEderal Towns. The resolution for one Town at or near the Falls of Delaware, was so dissatisfactory to the southern States, that there was no prospect of obtaining an Appropriation of Money to Erect Buildings for the Use of Congress, the Voice of nine States being necessary for this purpose. In order therefore to promote Harmony, without which we can never expect to preserve the Union, We consented to erect another Sett of Buildings, on the Potomack, for the alternate Residence of Congress, but one great object of this Resolve, on which all the eastern & southern States have united, is to preserve the fOEderal Ballance, Which We think is somewhat impaired by an Influence arising from the constant Residence of Congress in one State. The Loss of the Ballance should it ever happen, must be naturally followed by a Change of Government, which might involve us in greater Calamities than the Establishment of our Independence. The Expence therefore of erecting two Setts of Buildings, & of having double Archives cannot We think be put in Competition with the Advantages mentioned. Had We to save this Expence, consented to erect but one Sett of Buildings on the Delaware, a Number of wealthy, who are generally neither the most vertuous nor patriotic Citizens, by seating themselves in the fOEderal Town, might strengthen the Influence already existing, & too soon subject Us to an oligarchy or Aristocracy; but an alternate Residence, in two places, has an evident Tendency to prevent such Influence. We have hitherto reasoned on the Certainty of an Expence in erecting the Buildings, but the presumption is that they will be raised without an Expence, by the enhanced Value of the Territory of the fOEderal Town, after the Right of Soil is vested in the united States.(2) We have also the Honor to inclose the Treaty with Sweden,(3) to inform You that the second Thursday of December next is proposed by Congress, as a Day of Thanksgiving, thro'out the united States. We request You to present our best Respects to the honble Legislature, & to be assured that We remain Gentlemen, with the sincerest Esteem your most obedt. & most huml serts.  E. Gerry (4) S.

  Dear Hannah, Thursday Oct 23. 1783  Yesterday the gentlemen from Pensylvania attended (1) & with them Madison & Bland in expectation the question for a second fOEderal town would be brought on. Judge what their surprize must have been when they found it decided. But as if what was done would not sufficiently irritate Pensylvania the states of Massachusetts & Rhodeisland seem determined to drive her to desperation. The legislature of Pensylvania at their last session judging it proper and necessary, in order to satisfy the promises made to their officers & men to purchase of the Indians their claim to the lands within the boundary of the state, applied to Congress for leave to send commissioners to the proposed treaty to make the purchase. (2) This was referred to a comee. who highly approved the application of the legislature, pointed out the wisdom & good policy of the step, & recommended that the commissioners should give notice to the executive of Pensylvania of the time & place of holding the treaty in order that the commissioners of the state might attend, and that the commissioners of the United states should be instructed to give them every aid but so as not to be incompatible with the interests of the United states & the purposes they had in view. This was opposed by the delegates of Massachusetts & Rhodeisland, under pretence that it was contrary to the Articles of Confederation, that it might enhance the demands of the Indians for the land which the United states wanted to purchase or give an advantage to Pensylva. in making her purchase. Mr. Gerry seemed to intimate that he would agree to the measure, if Pensylvania would throw what she meant to give to the Indians into a common stock with the United states, & the commissioners for the United states had the sole management of the business. But this being refused, Massachusetts & Rhodeisland voted against the report and the application was rejected, there being only six of the eight states present in favour of the measure.(3) Fain would I hope that Pensylvania by her wisdom and magnanimity would shew herself superior to these insults & will not suffer  OCTOBER 24, 1783  herself to be driven into any intemperate measures. Sure I am that if she can for a short time persevere in the temperate conduct she has lately pursued she will in spite of the malice of her enemies establish her character for wisdom & moderation not only among the United states but among all the nations of Europe. The measures lately pursued by Congress will in a very short time reduce the United states to great distress & difficulties. I am much mistaken if the steps already taken will not ruin the measures of the Superintendt. so that by the 12th of next month, the time they have directed the president to adjourn Congress to Annapolis, the United states in Congress assembled will not be able to command as much money as will pay for removing their papers. Little do our shortsighted politicians dream of the precipice upon which they are standing or into what distress they are plunging their country. Their minds are intoxicated with their late success and their judgment blinded by passion and prejudice. Distress and dishonor will awaken people to their senses. The causes of it will be known and I shall not be surprized if those who have led them into it, quickly feel the effects of their resentment.  I received your letter of Tuesday. I beg you would not suffer your mind to be too much disturbed. Things will not long remain in their present situation. Either good sense & moderation will quickly reassume their place in our national council & we shall yet see happy days or the fabrick of our government will soon be destroyed & you and I, like doves to their windows, will retire to the enjoyment of our private estate.  Adieu my dear Hannah, take care of your health and keep up your spirits, & rest assured in all occurrences of the unfeigned affection, with which, I am, your loving husband, Cha Thomson  ""

 North Carolina Delegates to Alexander Martin  Sir, Princeton 24th October 1783  During the present month Congress have taken several resolutions respecting their future residence, We shall take the liberty of giving some detail of the progress of the business. New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Deleware, Marryland & Virginia were candidates for the honor not to say for the advantages of giving a residence to Congress; after much debate it appeared that seven States were for erecting public buildings on the Delaware, four States had voted for a Station near the falls of Potomack. On the 7th Instant it was \""Resolved that buildings for the use of Congress be erected on or near the banks of the Deleware provided a suitable district can be procured on or near the bank of the said River for a fOEderal town and that the right of soil and an exclusive or such other jurisdiction Congress may direct shall be vested in the United States.\""(1) \""That the place on the Delaware for erecting buildings for the use of Congress be near the falls.\""(2)  On the 8th a motion was made by Mr. Williamson & seconded by Mr Read.  \""To reconsider the resolution of Yesterday by which the residence of  OCTOBER 24, 1783  Congress is to be fixed near the falls of Delaware, in order to fix on some other place that shall be more central more favourable to the Union and shall approch nearer to that justice which is due to the southern States.\""(3) On putting the question after some debate there were five States for reconsidering and six against it. Though in this attempt we failed of a revisal and repeal of the vote it is clear that we injured the foundation.  Congress then proceeded of a place for the temporary residence of Congress. It was agreed by eight States that Princeton is not a convenient place for transacting the business of the United States. The question was put & negatived for adjourning to Trenton. The question was then put for adjourning to Philadelphia and was negatived. Five states only being for the question, A motion was then made for adjourning to Annapolis and the question was lost; four States only being for it.  On the 20th Inst. Congress Resolved as follows vizt. \""Whereas there is reason to expect that the providing buildings for the alternate residence of Congress in two places will be productive of the most salutary effects by securing the mutual confidence and affection of the States. RESOLVED that buildings be likewise erected for the use of Congress at or near the lower falls of Potomack or George town provided a suitable district on the banks of the river can be procured for a fOEderal town, and the right of soil and an exclusive Jurisdiction or such other as Congress may direct shall be vested in the United States and that until the buildings to be erected on the banks of the Delaware & Potomack shall be prepared for the reception of Congress their residence shall be alternately at equal periods of not more than one year and not less than six Months in Trenton & Annapolis. And the President is hereby authorised and directed to adjourn Congress on the 12th Day of November next to meet at Annapolis for the dispatch of public business.\""(4) You will readily believe that we contended with zeal for fixing Congress on the Waters of Chesapeak Bay. When you observe the steps that we took for defeating the vote respecting Delaware. We urged that the center of the United States, if length only be considered, is as far south as George Towne, but when the breadth is considered, the center is 100 miles to the Southward of George Town. That a wise Government should look forward to the numerous States that are fast rising out of the Western Territory. That if the center of the Inhabitants alone is considered there are already 300,000 more Inhabitants to the Southward of Delaware than to the North Eastward of it; and the balance is daily increasing to the Southward. As to climate, there is a very good one near the falls of Potomack and none of us was to expect personal immortality on this Globe. That our dignity and duration would depend on our regard to justice & equality. That pos-  terity would laugh at our fOEderal buildings and desert them if we should unwisely for selfish purposes fix them in a corner of the Empire. The history of Palaces in Williamsburg & New Bern were so much in the road and were proofs so much in point that we could not forget them.  We need hardly inform you that our zeal on this occasion was excited by additional arguments which we did not detail viz the honor and prosperity of the Southern States. That attention and of course the trade of Europe must ever be drawn in a particular manner to that part of the Empire where Congress resides. Hence by removing Congress to the Southward the progress of population must be increased in those States and their consequent wealth. Having succeded so far as to remove Congress to the Southward for six months or a Year we are not without hopes that some future Congress will prevent their return to this side of the waters of Chesapeak. You will be so good as to assure the General Assembly that on this as on every other occasion we have used our utmost efforts in pursuing what we suppose to be the Interest & the desire of our Constituents.  Enclosed is a copy of the ratification of the Treaty with Sweden.(5) Within a few days you will receive an authenticated copy of the preliminary Treaty with England & our ratification of the same,(6) but as we have not yet heard of it being ratified by the British King we only send the Treaty & ratification as information; for we shall hardly descend to any recommendations while there is a British Garison within the United States.  You will also receive a proclamation for the discharge of the whole army except a sufficient garrison for West Point.(7) We have the honor to be, &c. Benjamin Hawkins Hugh Williamson  ""

  Dear Hannah Friday Oct 24. 1783  I spent a pretty curious day yesterday and will endeavour to give an account of some of the incidents. In the morning I went rather earlier than usual to the office as I wanted to compleat a piece of business. Soon after Messrs. Howell and Tilton came in. Mr Howell said if I was  OCTOBER 24, 1783  not too busy they would wish to speak to me. I desired to know their will. They said they wanted to consult me on an application from Mr Gordon, who was preparing to write a history of the revolution & wished to be allowed Access to the offices & to be admitted to examine all the secret papers and transactions of Congress.(1) That I told him was a matter of which they were best able to judge. They wanted my Opinion. I told them if I were to hazard an Opinion it would be that the time and circumstances of our affairs would not admit of it. The design of Mr Gordon as an historian was to develope the secret springs & motives of Action, to trace and scan the conduct of the persons engaged in public councils & public measures, to find out if possible by what motives they were guided, whether in the determination of votes of importance & in their general conduct they were actuated & guided by the public good, by state politics or by passion, resentment or private interest. In short to enter into their hearts & thoughts, & delineate them to the world in their true Characters. And no doubt he expected & possibly might find, in rumaging the papers in the secretary Office, some original reports, motions or minutes that might lead to this knowledge. Again from the Office for foreign affairs he doubtless expected a clue to lead him to the characters of our ministers abroad, to trace the causes of their disputes and differences, which had done us no honour in the eyes of foreign nations; to find out the opinions they had formed of foreign courts, the advice they had given, the instructions under which they had acted, & the ends and objects which Congress had in view and the means they had used to attain them. In order that he might from thence embellish his history with reflections useful to posterity. In like manner I might proceed to the war department & office of finance. But from what I had said I submitted to their judgment, whether the present situation of our affairs & the present time would admit such an investigation. For my own part I feared it would not. Besides the present unsettled state of Congress, and the deranged state of the offices was a farther objection. Mr Howell said he was very much of my opinion & was obliged to me for it. The application of Mr Gordon was referred to them, & they wanted to know my opinion before they reported.  In the afternoon I dined at the presidents. Before dinner Howell attached himself to me and seemed uncommonly complaisant. In the morning the military establishment in time of peace had been under debate, and the power of Congress to garrison any posts or keep up any troops in time of peace was a subject of discussion in which he and his collegue Ellery had taken a warm part, and which they opposed with great vehemence, insisting that by the articles of Confederation the United states in Congress assembled had no right or power to garrison a single fort or keep up a single soldier in time of peace. That it rested with every individual state to provide for its own security   and defence, and that Congress had only the right to judge of the quantum or degree of force which each should keep up and that the general defence was provided for by that part of the articles which enjoined on each state to keep up a well regulated militia. That if a power was admitted to be in Congress to garrison posts & keep up troops it would be necessary to have it defined, least it should be abused to the injury of the individual states &c. On this subject he asked my Opinion. I told him that in matters of peace and war and what related to the general defence and common welfare the sovereign power of the United states was vested in Congress. That in every Sovereign there was a latent power to provide for the common safety and defence. To deny the existence of this power, would be absurd, to delineate & define it strictly would be dangerous. While it was employed for the public good & general safety no one could complain. If ever it was abused, it would be easy for the states to repress and restrain it. But considering the constitution of Congress, there was little danger of such an abuse. I therefore thought that in the present question a discussion of the power of Congress was unnecessary and that the only enquiry ought to be whether the public safety required the garrisoning of some posts, what posts those ought to be and what force will be necessary to maintain them. This being agreed on, it will then be necessary to consider on what footing they are to be established & how they are to be raised & kept up. He was pleased to say there was weight in what I said. At dinner I happened to be seated between him and Mr Gerry. I could not help smiling at my situation. The Minister of France had arrived in town and was at the table. At dinner the president who loves to talk and is not very curious in his choice of subjects started a conversation about the propriety of selling instead of removing the furniture of the president's house. Mr Peters observed that the expence of removing furniture backwards & forwards must be great, that selling it at every removal would incur a considerable loss. That therefore it would be necessary to have two setts, & instead of selling the furniture now he submitted whether it would not be best to keep it here till Congress returned & applying to Mr Gerry asked whether this was not good eastern OEconomy. I observed to my Assessors that I fancied it would be necessary to sell the furniture to raise money to defray the expense of removing the papers. This led Mr Howell to our finances & consequently to Mr Morris. He had a great respect for Mr Morris and his state were perfectly sensible of the great services he had done to the united states, but they were opposed to his plans and measures. That for his own part all his opposition arose from that and whatever might be thought, it never was his intention to injure him in his private capacity or character. I told him it was not for me to enter into any gentleman's thoughts or intentions. I could only judge of actions. However I would   put several circumstances together and leave others to form a conclusion. Mr Morris had entered into his Office at a time when there was an end of all public credit, when our army was on the point of disbanding for want not of pay but of provisions, when those who were enemies to our cause were pluming themselves with hopes of our speedy ruin, the timid & wavering seemed ready to provide for their safety by going over to the enemy & the most stout hearted had the most serious apprehensions of distress & danger. Without a farthing in the public treasury, without any well grounded hopes of a speedy supply, Mr M stept into office & by his personal credit & wise measures retrieved & established credit, & fed & kept the army together, until our enemy was compelled to acknowledge our independence and agree to a cessation of hostilities. When after this he was desirous of quitting the office, he was induced to continue till the army was disbanded. This he agreed to on Condition that an application should be made to the court of France for a farther aid of money and an earnest recommendation sent to the states to forward the supplies called for and on a most solemn assurance given by Congress to aid & support him in the measures he should take. On these conditions & assurances he continued And proceeded to issue his notes & enter into engagements until his anticipations amounted to a million of dollars. The moment this was known he, Mr H, had heard a motion to countermand the application to the court of France, to suspend the payment or collection of the taxes called for, and enquiries made by what authority Mr M issued notes & intimations thrown out that he was liable in his private capacity to be sued for those notes by the holders. Put all these together & what judgment is to be formed. He drew his face into a smile, which he has always at command & said aye, indeed, put all these together and it looks bad. In the mean while Peters had darted some strokes of wit at Gerry which seemed to touch him and as he has a great inclination to be thought a wit though I hardly ever knew any who had less pretensions to it he turned to me and said he had told somebody, I do not recollect whom he named, that he must do one of two things though he believed he would chuse the last, either to stay in Congress and learn to be a Salamander & live in fire, or to leave Congress. I told him if Gentlemen continued in the disposition they had lately discovered it would be proper to learn the use of the sword and to come armed to Debate. That if they acted and spoke conformable to the general sentiments of their constituents it was no matter how soon they parted. The sooner the better. For jarring interests prosecuted with such temper could never coalesce. And if they seperated before enmity took deep root, by mutual reproaches their common safety and common danger might the sooner bring the states together on better terms. I concluded the evening with the perusal of a pamphlet, sent me by Mr Dunlap, on a quarrel that has taken place in France between Mr  OCTOBER 25, 1783  Laurens & one <<I forget his Name> Edmund Jennings, a gentleman from Maryland.(2)  The enclosed note from Mr Lawrence will inform you of the state of affairs between him & me.

  Dear Hannah Saturday Oct 25. 1783  I received yours of Thursday N.7, And was exceedingly surprized and much concerned to find upon opening it that you had not received a letter from me since Sunday. I had written with great freedom and sent a letter every day by the stage directing it to be given to the driver and not to any of the passengers, that you might receive it the same evening. I was somewhat relieved by the postscript, which informed that mine of Monday & Tuesday had got to hand. I wish you would direct Peter to attend every evening at the Indian King till the stage comes in and to search the box & pocket of the stage where the letters are kept. You may depend that one goes by every stage. And I  OCTOBER 25, 1783  should be sorry any were lost. It would make me more cautious in expressing my sentiments.  I am much pleased with the attention you paid to Mr. Spear & his daughter. We are under obligations to him, which I longed to repay. You have not told me what sort of a girl his daughter is, nor given me any account of our Baltimore friends.  As I mean the carriage house only for a temporary convenience I would have it made of rough boards and am very indifferent where it is placed. I think it may as well be placed on the street adjoining the enclosed lot. It will serve for a lime house if ever I should build.  I will not trouble you with any anxiety about my future plan of life. I can form none for happiness or satisfaction in this world, unless you are with me. I am now advanced in life and find myself much more helpless for having been so long helped and tended by you. And yet I confess I have a strong desire, to watch the workings of the present ferment, to mark the characters of the present actors and to see the issue of present measures.

  Gentlemen Princetown Oct. 27th 1783 Previous to my leaving the Chair of Congress, I take the liberty again to address you, merely as an individual that you may not be left totally without Information until the Choice of a Minister for foreign Affairs shall take place. I have pressed Congress much on this subject, and am fully convinced of the difficult Situation you must be in for want of Information from this important Office. I have the honor of acknowledging the rect of your several favours of the ______.(1) My last addressed to you, was on the 15th of July giving you a minute account of the Mutiny of the Soldiers in Philadelphia and of our subsequent removal to this Place--since which we have remained here tho. in but indifferent Circumstances of accommodation. Congress lately have determined to fix their place of Residence at the Head of the Delaware over the Falls of Trenton. They take in contemplation to fix another place the Falls of Potomack near Georgetown and to sit alternately at each Place year about. They have also determined to adjourn on the 8th Novr (2) to Annapolis for their temporary residence. They have also passed several important Acts lately, which you will see by the several Proclamations contained in the Newspapers which I do myself the honor of transmitting herewith from the month of Sept 2d. Congress have not yet taken the Appointment of a minister for foreign Affairs under Consideration, as their Time is principally taken up with previous measures of a Peace arrangement both Civil & Military. It will now be put off till the removal to Annapolis. I shall add to this Letter (I believe) several Acts of Congress In consequence of a Report on your last Official Letter we have been most Anxiously (looking ?) for the Definitive Treaty which is really a matter of much more importance in this Country than it is in Europe. The States at best cannot be convinced that Peace is made to any Purpose without this welcome Act, and the Conduct of the British in these States has confirmed them in the Opinion. We lately sent Baron Steuben to Canada to settle with Genl Waldenson (3) the Time and manner of delivering up & receiving the Posts and fortifications on the Frontiers whenever that Genl should be ready so to do. He was refused even a conference on the subject. Genl Waldenson declaring that he knew of no Peace between Britain and America, that his orders were to cease Hostilities which he had carefully done but could go no further. The Baron thinks they are planning their schemes in Canada for holding the Frontier Posts for a year or two longer which would prove ruinous to these States rendition of them must be urged without delay. The Min- OCTOBER 27, 1783  ister from Holland is arrived and to receive his public Audience on Friday next.  The Effects of the Mutiny in Philadelphia are all done away. The Sergeants who were condemned to die, recd Pardon from Congress in the very last moment of despair this has had a good Effect and the Army have been disbanded without any bad consequences but unhappily without Money.  Nov. 1st. Yesterday we gave public audience to Mr Van Berckel. Just before the Ceremony began Col Ogden arrived with the News of the completion of the Definitive Treaty,(4) this gave a large addition to the general Joy that was already great on the occasion of the Day. Mr Van Berckel appears to be a person very much suited to the Manners of our People and I am very much mistaken if he does not do great honor to his Commission. I shall endeavour to enclose his address and our answer.(5) Novr 3d. This Morning Congress met & made choice of a new President for the ensuing Year. General Mifflin was unanimously chosen, tho' absent I suppose he will take the Chair in a day or two. I feel myself very happy in having filled up my year and that after having devoted myself altogether to the Public Service for near eight years, I am like to retire to private Life under the blessings of so glorious a Peace. My Presidentship has also been honored by the Signature of both Preliminary Articles & Definitive Treaty which has greatly compensated for all my other Sacrifices. E B.

  Dear Sir. Princeton Oct. 28th. 1783 The following information is the best I can give on your questions at present. I shall have great pleasure in communicating hereafter any further particulars. The Best wheat Counties on the Western Shore of Maryland are Washington, Frederick, Montgomery, Baltimore, & Hartford. The 3 first are most convenient to George Town, the others to Baltimore; but the greatest part of the produce of all those Counties is carried to Baltimore, which likewise draws to it a considerable share of the Wheat &c. of Lancaster, York, & Cumberland counties in Pensila.  There were exported from Maryland from Jany 5th 1773 to Jany. 5th 1774--233,000 Busshells of Indian Corn, 226,000. Busshells Wheat & 84,500 Barrells of Flour. It is not in my power to give you at present information of the proportions of Wheat exported from the different ports of Maryland. The exportation from Baltimore was probably greater than from all the other ports of the State--I mean of wheat & flour--there was a considerable quantity exported from Chester Town on the Eastern Shore, & from George Town; it was encreasing from the latter place. The Wheat was bought by factors, or Merchants from the Waggons as they came down, excepting when contracts are made with farmers who make considerable quantities. I doubt whether the quantity of wheat mentiond in yours cou'd be readily obtaind by May in any one place without raising the Market. The price will depend on the demand and the number of purchasers. The method to obtain it on the best terms wou'd be to employ one factor, he will look round to the different places of export, and act according to circumstances. Many factors in different parts might raise the price on each other without the whole business was under the charge of one person. I think the best Wheat for exportation comes from Washington, Frederick & Montgomery Counties. The wheat in the apposide Counties of Potomack in Virginia is of the same quallity. The Counties of Ccil, Kent, Queen Ann & Talbot on the E. Shore yield wheat which answers but for being ground into flour. It is carried chiefly to Baltimore & to the Waters of Delaware, I believe the greater part to the latter.  The price of wheat varied in some proportions to the distance of the several places from Pha. It was but very little under the Pha. Market on the E. Shore from the convenience of the Delaware--Something still less in Baltimore & at George Town abt 6d per Busshell less  OCTOBER 28, 1783  than at Baltimore. The Average price at George Town during a few years before the war was from 6/3 to 6/6 per Busshell. I am, Dear Sr., with great esteem, your Mo. Obt Servant, Danl. Carroll ""

  Sir, Circular Princeton 29th October 1783 I have the honor to enclose your Excellency an exemplification of the Preliminary Treaty with Great Britain and the ratification thereof by Congress.(1) The reason of this act of Congress having been thus delayed arose from many important considerations--Among others we waited for some explanations from our Ministers, which we have lately received, and are encouraged to believe that the ratifications are exchanged in England.  Congress did not choose to attend this exemplification with any recommendation to the States,(2) as their principal desire at present is to prevent the States from doing anything which would render the carrying of the articles, on our part, hereafter, into full execution, any way impracticable, especially as one part of these is to take place on a ratification in America.  I have the honor to be &c. E. B. OCTOBER 31, 1783  ""

I enclose an Extract of a Letter from Dr. Franklin relative to Trade,(1) and am to inform your Honr. that I have not been able to obtain any decision on Loan Office certificates, neither can I reasonably expect that Congress will comply with the desire of the State I am Honrd. in representing;(2) it has been determined that nine States are necessary to consider the subject, the frequent small representation, & great and national questions when it hath been larger, hath induced the delay thereon.

  Congress room 31 Octbr. 4 o clock. The Dutch minister has had his audience. I expected Jack; but I suppose he did not receive my Letter in Season, or he had engagements that could not be dismissed.(1) The Dutchman acquitted himself very well. He has been accostomed to speak before a large assembly and yet he appeared embarrassed. This, my friend was a great compliment to those he addressed; for if he had been perfectly at his ease, Congress would not have been so sensible of their station. You know there is a similitude between the history of the United Netherlands  OCTOBER 31, 1783  and that of the United States of America. The one extricated themselves from the yoke of Spain, after great struggles and sufferings, and the other, from that of Great Britain. In this point of view the meeting was like that of persons who have encountered similar dangers, and whose success has brought them together. But enough of ministers and public spectacles. I leave these to speak to my beloved. I wrote you last night, and last Sunday and this morning--but as I did not expect to find a conveyance before the post that I could trust to, so I left the letters at my quarters. Major Jackson tells me that he will be in town, to-morrow night, and this gives me an opportunity of relieving my charmer from a very natural apprehension. I know, notwithstanding the confidence expressed in your letter, that you will fear for the fate of your picture. It is my charmer, close to my heart at this moment, which it, and your letter have delighted--soothed--affected--and afflicted. But Congress are breaking up--to dine with Mr. Van Berckel, and I must enclose this to your brother in order to give it to Major Jackson.

  Sir, Private Princeton 1st November 1783 I have the honor of acknowledging the receipt of your several public letters under the dates of June the 23d to July the 18th inclusive, by Capt. Barney.(1) Nothing is done in consequence of those letters but what is contained in the instructions inclosed in my official letter by this opportunity to the Commissioners jointly.  Congress have not come to any further determination on your last letters, relative to your resignation; on account of the peace arrangement not being yet settled.  Perhaps there will be but very few Ministers employed in Europe, and these in the Character of Residents or simply Ministers.  The conduct of Great Britain does not appear yet very conciliating, and her measures on this side the water have rather tended to irritate than otherwise.  Congress will not be in a hurry to send a Minister to the Court of London, till they see how the definitive Treaty will end. We have an account this day from Colo. Ogden that it was signed on the 3d of September, and that Mr. Thaxter is on his way with it, whom we long to see.  Your letters on the subject of our credit abroad and the strengthening and cementing the union at home, came at a happy moment, and have had a very good effect.(2) Your Countrymen were running wild on this subject, but your observations & opinion have helped to check them, and the Legislature of Massachusetts have passed the 5 Per Cent Impost recommended by Congress.  Mr. Van Berckel is arrived and yesterday received his first public audience of Congress. This address and our answer I send to the Commissioners jointly. He appears to justify the high opinion we had  NOVEMBER 1, 1783  formed of the wisdom of the States of the United Netherlands. The choice of a Minister so consonant to the temper and manners of the Citizens of these States, shew their good judgment and prudence. We are much pleased with this Gentleman, and as far as I can judge from present appearances, I may venture to predict that he will cement the union of the two Republics.  I shall leave the Chair of Congress on Monday, and return to private life at Elizabeth Town, after almost eight years spent in the service of my Country. I rejoice to have seen the end of all our labours so happily accomplished, and shall ever revere those great men, who have lent an helping Hand to the glorious work.  In private or public life I shall be always glad of the honor of a line from you, Sir, if but to announce your health and welfare.

I will endeavour to enclose you some of the latest News-papers, which I am sure will be agreeable to you at such a distance from your Native Country, and especially as they contain some of the most material acts of Congress on public matters.  Congress have no Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Livingston having resigned in May last.

Congress have agreed to form two fOEderal Towns for their residence. The one near the Falls of Potowmack, the other near the falls of Delaware, and to sit alternately, year about, in each.

I have the honor of acknowledging the receipt of your favours of the 12th of June and from the 22d to the 25th of July, by Capt.

I enclose our answer, which I must beg the favour of your forwarding through the proper Channel.(4) A copy of it you have enclosed for your information.  The plan of the peace establishment is not yet so far digested with certainty that I can give you any answer to your request of dismission or relating to your Grandson. Of this you may however be assured, that it is the prevailing disposition of Congress to do every thing for you or your Grandson that they can, consistent with the general plan they shall establish. Tho' perhaps you are not without your enemies, yet they are so few, that I am sure they never can prevent, or even unnecessarily delay, the gratitude of your Country, which is acknowledged your just due by even the few who are suspected to be not altogether your friends. As far as I can judge of the peace establishment, it will be to employ but two or three ministers in Europe and those not  NOVEMBER 1, 1783  higher in Character than Residents, or simply Ministers. The business in other places to be done by Consuls. Our Finances are so very low as to require every OEconomical measure.  I have received the additional number of Medals, which, not having any particular directions from you, I distributed among the Members of Congress; presented one to the governor of each State, and the Ministers round Congress. The compliment to the Grand Master of Malta, I doubt not, will produce good effects, and for which the commercial interests of this Country will be much indebted to you.  Your approbation of the Revd. Mr. Wren's conduct has produced the enclosed vote of thanks to that Gentleman. I send for your perusal my letter to Dr. Wren, with a Diploma I obtained for him from the University in this place, which I beg you will seal and forward.(5) I shall leave the Chair of Congress next Monday and return to private life at Elizabeth Town, where however I shall always think myself honored by hearing of your health & happiness.

By my Letters to the Comrs Jointly of July last, (2) you have undoubtedly been informed of our leaving Philadelphia & taking up our Residence in this Place. The Mutiny that occasioned this removal soon subsided and order & harmony was speedily restored by a voluntary submission of the mutineers. Several of them were condemned to be shot and their Partners in Guilt ordered to do the execution. In the last moments of despair, they were all pardoned by Congress, which has had a good effect. This army is disbanded & gone home tho without any money. The Expectation of seeing you here in the Spring gives your friends great Pleasure. Congress were agreed to form two federal Towns one near the falls of the Potomack, the other near the falls of the Delaware set alternately year about at each Place.

  Sir In Congress Novr. 1. 1783.  We have the honor of transmitting to your Excellency two Resolusions of Congress respecting their permanent & temporary residence.(1) We consider it as superfluous to enter into a minute detail of the progress of questions, the determinations of which (involving in 'em the general & particular interests of States) were protracted to a tedious length of time in order to give them the most mature deliberation. We therefore submit the result & will only generally remark, (that considering the present population of the Continent, so unfavorable as it is to an exclusive residence of the general Council at George Town & the votes of the ConfOEderacy so unfriendly as they are to a southern station & observing that the negativing any other place, was an affirmative in favor of Princeton in which we sat, a situation every way agreable to the Eastern & middle States) we are led to hope, that our conduct as far as it tended to establish the present votes will be satisfactory to our constituents.  NOVEMBER 1, 1783  Congress have agreed to a Report on Indian Affairs, which we also enclose to Yr. Excellency. (2) The very critical situation in which we found ourselves, with respect to those Savages, render'd it necessary to decide on a state of Peace or War. They in expectation of our determination in favor of the former, were already assembling in order to hold a Treaty--a moment so favorable was embrac'd in order to exact from 'em as a compensation for their unprovok'd & merciless ravages a district of Country, which might satisfy the claims of the Army & contribute towards alleviating the public burthens--other circumstances were also very pressing. We had before us authentic information of continual & extensive emigrations made into a Country which unless otherwise dispos'd of, wou'd not only remain profitless to the United States, but woud become a prey to lawless banditti & adventurers, who must necessarily have involv'd us in continued Indian wars & perhaps have form'd Establishments not only on dissimilar principles to those which form the basis of our Republican Constitutions, but such as might eventually prove destructive to them. It was judg'd that a delay untill the Spring without taking the intermediate steps necessary to the then settling this Country with the Army & others, under the protection, direction & for the use of the United States, wou'd be sacrificing too much to that scrupulous delicacy, which might suggest a passive Conduct to Congress, as proper untill the State of Virginia shou'd have acceded to some alterations in the conditions of her Cession--which were indeed consider'd as of so trivial a nature as not to prevent her Delegates in Congress giving their unanimous assent to them.  To these Reasons which were continually press'd on our minds by the entreaties of the Army, urged by the Commander in Chief may be attributed the Proclamation issued by Congress, respecting the illicit Settlement of these Lands.(3) The Delegates of Virginia were in a delicate situation not convinc'd of the necessity or propriety of their opposing measures generally thought to be for the public good & which perhaps it will be the future policy of the State to direct to be pursued with vigor & effect.(4) Yr. Excellency will find among the enclosures a state of the payments of the respective States & an account as far as has yet been compleated of the expenditures of Public Monies, with such other papers as we thought woud tend to elucidate our general Affairs.(5) Congress have had long before them a Report on those arrangements which may be necessary for our security in time of Peace--it is the result of the wisdom & experience of the Commander in Chief assisted by every Officer whose rank & reputation promis'd lights on the subject.(6) The temporary adoption of such part of it, as may be necessary to provide Garrisons for the Western Posts which G. Britain has   ceded & the guarding the Continental Stores, which it appears to be the present idea of Congress shou'd be distributed in five equal portions thro' the States from North to South--may not admit of delay--but permanent measures on so important & delicate a subject, will no doubt be postpon'd untill our Constituents have time to deliberate & to express their sense on such plans as may be submitted to their consideration; & even what we are compell'd now to do, We think will have referrence to what they may hereafter generally direct.  We also transmit to your Excellency a Copy of a Letter from the Honorable Jon. Adams--the subject is so important & interesting & at the same time the reflections made, so very evident & uncontrovertible, that to yr. Excellency all comment wd. be unnecessary. We will still add that we have but too certain grounds to beleive that his prognostications are fast fulfilling.(7) The late ordinance publish'd by the French Governor at Hispaniola (for which we refer to the Paper enclos'd) taken with the British Acts of Council, we cannot but consider as the preludes of a concerted System for imposing pernicious & cruel restraint on our Commerce.(8) Massachusetts as we hear by private Letters, has at length agreed to the Recommendations of Congress.(9) If we once regain the reputation of mutual confidence & concertion, we can no longer dread the resentment of determin'd foes or the interested policy of undetermined friends & we cannot but rely, on the virtue, wisdom & temper which we know pervade the Continent & which have heretofore rendered us superiour to force, machination or intrigue.

  Gentlemen, Princeton 3d Novr. 1783  We have the honor to lay before the Genl. Assembly in conformity to our instructions an estimate of the arrearages to the 1st of Jany 1783, & one years interest arising on the foreign & domestic debt as containd in paper No. 1.(1) In the close of the printed paper respecting Western territory (2) is the quota of each State, on the requisition of eight millions of dollars for the Service of the year 1782, the sums paid by each, up to the 1st of July 1783, & the balances then outstanding. It has not yet been in our power to obtain an account of the money paid by each State on the requisitions for the present year. These accounts however which we transmit will give your honors the most perfect State which can be obtain'd of our national debt up to the 1st of Jany. 1783.  The letters from our Ministers in Europe come no lower than the 9th August.(3) Commercial obstacles, it seems, had prevented the completion of the definitive treaty; as there was little prospect of these being remov'd, our Commissioners were dispos'd to make the preliminary articles, the articles of the definitive treaty & to leave commercial regulations to be adjusted in a seperate treaty.  It appears that the important situation into which this Country is thrown by the peace has attracted the attention of every Commercial power in Europe--hardly one of which that has not already propos'd to enter into treaties of Amity & Commerce. Great Britain is in the number, but she moves upon principles opposite to our interest. She is still possessed with the vain expectation, that our trade must be subject to her Laws. She has examined our Confederation, & finds it leaves Congress without the power of establishing a navigation act, or such commercial regulations as wou'd be equally binding, & operative  NOVEMBER 3, 1783  in each State. In consequence of this, she proposes to bring in her own Ships, & by her own seamen, upon her own terms, whatever we may want, & to carry in the Same ships, & with the Same seamen whatever she may be pleasd to purchase. If her system does not go to this extent, we think, that at least, it comes very near it. The two proclamations which she has issued will serve to examplify what we have said.(4) The first of which restricting the importation of the produce of any of the United States to vessels belonging to Great Britain, and navigated according to their Laws; or to vessels belonging to the State of which the cargoes are the produce. For example, a Philadelphia vessel can carry no tobacco, rice, or indigo; nor a Carolina vessel, wheat or flour; nor a Boston vessel, either, unless the produce of its own State. By such means as these the Court of London think to possess themselves of the carriage of allmost all the productions of the United States, to annihilate our navigation, & nurseries of Seamen, & keep all trade to themselves more affectually than ever. The other proclamation when considered in conjunction with their subsisting trade laws absolutely prohibits American vessels or Subjects from trading to their Islands or Colonies. We submit to the consideration of the Honorable the General Assembly the expediency of vesting Congress with powers adequate to the formation of a navigation act, or such other general power, as may be competent to frustrate the projects & commercial regulations of Great Britain. We herewith subjoin extracts of Letters from Mr John Adams dated relative to this Subject.(5) No. 2 is a copy of a representation made by our Commissioners on the subject of British Debts, with their opinion of the time at which hostilities ceased.(6) The paper, No 3, contains a motion to postpone the consideration of a report on an act of the General Assembly of last session for a partial payment of the troops of the line of the State.(7) On considering this report the Honorable the General Assembly may perceive the propriety of instructing their Delegates with such reasons as may be satisfactory to Congress & prevent the report being agreed to.  The Western territory is so important in itself, & its consequences, that we have thought it adviseable to transmit a full detail of the late proceedings of Congress on this subject. That these may be better known we have had a Sufficient number of copies printed for the members of both Houses.(8) In our motion to postpone the report on the Virginia cession,(9) we have endeavoured to preserve in its full extension the early claim of the State of Maryland to a common interest in this vast Country, & at the Same time to hold up to the view of Congress, and the World, how essential it is to go into the disposal of that territory for the sake of harmony, & the exoneration of our public burthens. Connected with this subject is the proclamation of the 14th of Octr. No 4.(10) We cannot pretend to judge what will be the de-  termination of the Assembly of Virginia as to the report on their cession. There is reason however to conclude from circumstances that the Assembly will confirm the terms of the report. Connected also with the same Subject are the inclosd papers No. 5.(11) In No. 6 will be found the various proceedings of Congress respecting their residence.(12) From these it will be seen that it was an object particularly desired by Delaware, contended for by Pennsilvania; enjoyd by New Jersey & Sought after by New York.  We submitt these matters to the Legislature, that they may take such measures as may confirm what is still doubtful.  The inclosed copy of a letter No 7(13) will we presume be deem'd of Sufficient authority to justify us in presenting our congratulations to the Honorable the Genl. Assembly on the happy Event of the Signing of the definitive treaty.  We have the honor to be with the most profound respect, Gentlemen, yr. mo. Obt & very Hble Servs Danl.

This Gentleman being absent a chairman was elected--when a motion was brought forward and agreed to, that in the absence of the president the chairman adjourn Congress on the 6th instant to meet at Annapolis on the 26.(1)  This step was taken in consequence of some doubts as to the propriety of the resolutions for adjournment under the late Congress. We flatter ourselves that the business is now closed; and beg leave to submit it to the wisdom of the house the adoption of such arrangements and measures previous to the 26--as may best serve to accommodate Congress--and to render their residence, and the residence of foreign ministers agreeable.

I should be exceedingly happy on my own Account, but more particularly on yours, Madam, to see Mr Adams in America, because I am persuaded he would not only be in the Way of rendering at this Time essential Services to his Country, but also (by recovering his Health), to himself & Family. The perplexities of American politics, are neither pleasing nor salutary; much less so must there be, which are in the Center & subject to all the Subtleties & Intrigues of European Systems; but the probability is I think against his immediate return.  The postmasters have either misconstrued or perverted the Design of the post office Ordnance, which provides that Letters to & from certain persons in publick office, on publick business shall be exempt from postage.(2) The Endorsement of such persons Names on their Letters is therefore sufficient to acquit the Receiver thereof from postage; but the postmasters have, as I am informed, in many Cases where the Members of Congress & the Commander in chief have not endorsed with the Words \""on publick Business,\"" had the assurance to take postage; not so much I apprehend to benefit the publick, as to save the 20 per Cent allowed to the postoffice,(3) but Measures are taken since the Receipt of your Letter to correct this Error, & I presume the Frank of our foreign Ministers will be admitted in Future by order of Congress.

Mr. Van Berckel Plenipotentiary from the United Netherlands was admitted to an audience in Congress,(1) jest before his introduction, a private Letter gave information to Congress of the signing of the definitive Treaty on the third of September last.(2) Altho this information was not Official, yet it was so well authenticated as to admit no doubt of its truth, and contributed much to heighten the joy on the occasion.

This will close the distressing scene of the War and I hope diffuse general joy and the most unfeigned gratitude to Heaven thro' these United States, and at the same time lay the foundation of a permanent Peace & general happiness throughout this extensive Republic. On the third Instant the new Congress met, and made choice of the Honble.

  Dear Sir(1) Philadelphia Nov. 10. 1783. I arrived at this place, not hearing till I had almost reached it that Congress had determined to remove for a time to Annapolis. Being engaged in some necessary business and knowing that the first day of the new Congress at Princetown would be emploied in chusing their president and other formalities of no public consequence, I did not join them there till the second day,(2) and that evening they adjourned from that place: so that I have had and shall have the trouble of travelling near 400 miles more than would have been necessary. The rule of rotation had reduced the choice of a President to Pennsylvania, Rhode island and N. Carolina.(3) The choice fell pretty unanimously on General Mifflin. You will have seen the votes for dividing the residence of Congress between Trenton and Annapolis till accomodations can be provided at Georgetown which is then to be substituted for Annapolis. This however is not to be considered as an ultimate determination. Trenton alone had been fixed on. The Southern delegates, extremely dissatisfied with this, contrived after an interval of many days to get a vote for Georgetown in the terms you have seen.4 I rather view this as unsettling the point which had been previously determined [...] whole matter open for discussi[on....]  I have not yet been a[ble...] am under great anxieties [...pro]vide good tutors than a [...] Mrs. Eppes that there [...] place so shaped and [...neces]sary among our countrywomen.

  Sir Philadelphia Nov. 11. 1783. Your Excellency's letter of the 25th. Ult. on the determination of Congress as to their future residence has been duly received.(1) You would doubtless soon after have heard of their subsequent determination on the same subject.(2) As all this had taken place before my arrival I can give you an account only from the information of others.(3) Congress, it seems, thought it best to generalize their first determination by putting questions on the several rivers on which it had been proposed that they should fix their residence. Hudson's river, the Delaware and Patowmac were accordingly offered to the vote. The first obtained scarcely any voices; the Delaware obtained seven. This of course put Patowmac out of the way:(4) and the Delaware being once determined on there was scarcely any difference of opinion as to the particular spot. The falls met the approbation of all the states present except Pennsylvania, which was for Germantown, and Delaware which was for Wilmington. As to the latter it appeared that she had been induced to vote for the Delaware on the single idea of getting Congress to Wilmington, and that being disappointed in this, they would not wish them on that river at all, but would prefer Georgetown or any other place. This being discovered, the southern delegates at a subsequent day brought on a reconsideration of the question, and obtained a determination that Congress should set one half their time at Georgetown and that till accomodations should be provided there, Annapolis should be substituted in it's place. This was considered by some as a compromise; by others as only unhinging the first determination and leaving the whole matter open for discussion at some future day. It was in fact a rally, and making a drawn battle of what had at first appeared to be decided against us. What will be it's final deci- NOVEMBER 11, 1783  sion can only be conjectured. I take the following to be the disposition of the several states.  The four Eastern states are for any place in preference to Philadelphia. The more Northern it is however the more agreeable to them. New York, and New Jersey are for the falls of Delaware. Pennsylvania is for Germantown first, and next for the falls of Delaware. It is to be noted that Philadelphia had no attention as permanent seat.  Delaware is for Wilmington: but for Georgetown in preference to the falls of Delaware or any other situation which would attract the trade of their river.  Maryland is for Annapolis, and to the smallest hope for this will sacrifice a certainty for Georgetown.  Virginia. Every place Southward of Patowmac being disregarded by the states as every place North of the Delaware was it would be useless to consider her interests as to more Southern positions. The falls of Patowmac will probably therefore unite the wishes of the whole state. If this fails, Annapolis and the falls of Delaware are then the Candidates. Were the convenience of the Delegates alone to be considered, or the general convenience to government in their transaction of business with Congress, Annapolis would be preferred without hesitation. But those who respect commercial advantages more than the convenience of individuals will probably think that every position on the bay of Chesapeak or any of it's waters is to be dreaded by Virginia as it may attract the trade of that bay and make us with respect to Maryland what Delaware state is to Pennsylvania. Considering the residence of Congress therefore as it may influence trade, if we cannot obtain it on the Patowmac it seems to be our interest to bring it past all the waters of Chesapeak bay.  The three Southern states are for the most Southern situation. It should be noted that N. Hampshire and Georgia were absent on the decisions of these questions, but considering their interests would be directly opposite, it was thought their joint presence or absence would not change the result. From the preceding state of the views of the several members of our union your Excellency will be enabled to judge what will be the probable determination on any future revision of the present plan; the establishment of new states will be friendly or adverse to Georgetown according to their situation. If a state be first laid off on the lakes it will add a vote to the Northern scale, if on the Ohio it will add one to the Southern. I had the happiness of seeing Genl. Washington the other day after an interval of 7 years. He has more health in his countenance than I ever saw in it before. Among other political conversations he entered earnestly into one respecting   the Western cession of Virginia, and the late vote of Congress accepting it.(5) He thinks the conditions annexed by Virginia and not acceded to by Congress altogether unimportant, at least much less important than the consequences which would result from the state's adhering to these conditions. He thinks that a friendly and immediate settling of the matter can alone give us that political happiness and quiet which we must all wish for: and that besides other disagreeable consequences the land will be lost to both as a source of revenue by the settlement of adventurers on it who will not pay anything. It is now become evident that the nine states North of Patowmac have made up their minds on these questions and will act together.  I have the honour to be with very great respect your Excellency's most obedt. & most humble servt, Th. Jefferson ""

  My dear Mr Adams Philadelphia 23d Novr 83. (Sunday Even) Mr Thaxter arrived here last Evening, by the Way of New York with the definitive Treaty,1 having narrowly escaped a severe storm by reaching that Port on Wednesday Evening. Your Favours by him I have received with great Pleasure,2 as I was in Want of the Information they contain, as well as of your Sentiments on several important Subjects. Governor Reed will probably deliver You this, & my Confidence in him will induce me to be explicit. NOVEMBER 23, 1783  The great object of our political Enterprize with Britain is obtained; & if We have Wisdom & Virtue to improve the advantages the Issue must be happy.  \""Laus Deo\"" should be the Motto of America & inscribed on every Device for commemorating this great Event; for none but Atheists can be insensible of the first obligation wch. result on the Occasion.  Our gratitude should nevertheless be shewn to such Individuals, as by their eminent Services, have been principal[ly] Instrumental in promoting the Measure; & I consider it as an act of justice, with a meritorious Washington & Green to rank those that are equally so in my Mind, an Adams & Jay. You will know that I am not addicted to Flattery, that I have an aversion to so contemptible a practice, but sensible as I am of the Benefits derived from your able negotiations in Europe, as well as your Services in America, give me leave to express an Impatience, & of Concern, not merely at the feeble attempts to sully the Reputation You have so nobly acquired; but also at the neglect & Indifference that has been manifested in doing that Justice to your Character which Generosity & good Policy should in my opinion long e'er this have exhibited; & which no Exertions on my part Shall be wanting to perpetuate. Indeed the Ingratitude which You have hitherto experienced is not to be imputed to the Citizens of America at large, but to some Amongst them of ambitious & perhaps envious principles who think \""all made for one, not One for all.\"" Our Concerns are twofold, foreign & domestic--the former by the Abilities, (entirely by the Integrity & Abilities) of two of our Ministers, in negotiating the peace, are so far upon the best Footing. The Success of our Arms, God knows, would have been of no Service to Us, had not the Magnanimity & Fortitude of our Ministers induced them to have departed in some Instances from their, (excuse me for calling them) servile Instructions--to compleat our external Concerns, nothing appears to me necessary, excepting Treaties of Commerce on reciprocal Terms, with every European Power that desires it. I am therefore fully of your opinion, with Respect to the Continuance of our Ministers for this purpose, & for establishing a Treaty of Amity with the Dey of Algiers & those other barbary princes that infest our Commerce, after which, I can see no necessity; but great Inconveniences in sending Ministers abroad or receiving them at Home, unless for special purposes. You will probably enquire, what Inconveniences I allude to, & the answer is, the Inconveniences of being entangled with European politics; of being the puppets of European Statesmen; of being gradually divested of our virtuous republican principles; of being a divided, influenced, & dissipated, people; of being induced to Prefer the Splendor of our Court, to the Happiness of our Citizens; & finally of changing our Form of Government, established at an amazing Expence of Blood & Treasure, for a vile Aristocracy, & an arbitrary   Monarchy. These are the inconveniences, or rather the deplorable evils which I apprehend from a permanent System of Embassies, & had You seen what I have been so unfortunate as to see, after only three Years Absence from Congress, almost a total Change of political principles; & had You the same Reasons for tracing those Effects to the Causes alluded to, perhaps We should not differ much in our proposals for a Remedy. We are my dear sir happily placed at a distance from civilized stations; We are surrounded by barbarous ones, which if they could be humanized, would in my opinion be as far beyond some that boast of being civilized, as they conceive themselves to be above the others. If such a Love of Grandeur & power, as induces men to prefer Art, Intrigue, Injustice, perfidy & Inhumanity to the contrary Virtues, designate a civilized Nation, in Gods Name, may America never aspire to the delusive Honor, but may her ne plus Ultra be such a Degree of Dignity as is consistent with good Faith, & admits the Salus populi to be suprema Lex--remote then from civilized Nations, wherein consists the policy of such Connections with them as must produce a change of our principles both moral & political, a Change of our Government; the Loss of our internal Confidence & Tranquility; an Interest in their Broils & quarrels; in short Wars perpetual intestine or foreign? Perhaps You may say these are chimeras, mere Creatures of the Imagination; that can never be realized, by a ministerial Intercourse with European Powers: but behold the Influence already established in the united States by such Means, & then judge for Yourself, with this Assurance, if We differ in opinion on this point, that I shall with the greatest pleasure listen to your Reasons & be happy in acquiescing in them.  Our domestic affairs are much deranged in Consequence of the Necessity We have been under from the Commencement of the War of neglecting them altogether, or of using temporary Expedients--the first object of Attention is the Support of publick Credit. Independence will disgrace Us, unless We are honest in Payment of the publick Debts. This is a difficult Task! but not impracticable. An Impost has been layed or rather proposed & the objections to it have been represented as manifesting a Disposition to violate the publick Faith. This Representation is neither candid nor just, & those who are opposed to the Impost have as I conceive better Reasons on their Part, for suspecting the Supporters of the Plan of a Design to establish an undue Influence, & to involve the Affairs of the Treasury in Mistery & perplexities that cannot be easily developed. The fact seems to be this, it is difficult to form a Valuation & collect Taxes by the confederation as it now stands. It may therefore require such an alteration as will remedy these Defects, the former, may be removed by adopting Numbers in Lieu of property, & the latter, by enabling Congress to levy Executions on the property of Individuals of delinquent States, with provision for   obliging the Treasurers thereof to reimburse the Amount of the property, with Damages, to such Individuals, out of the first Money that may be brot into the respective Treasuries. I have the fullest Confidence in the Integrity of the States, & am persuaded they will either accede to some such propositions when made by Congress, or propose others that will be equally effectual. But surely they are under no obligation of Reason or Justice, to adopt a System for supporting publick Credit, incompatible with the principles of the fOEderal Constitution, & dangerous to their Liberties. The people in some of the States have objected to the half pay or (3) Commutation granted by Congress to the Army; & the Reason assigned is that this Grant was expressly made, to reimburse the Losses sustained by the Depretiation of their pay, which has been since made good. This I believe was the Fact, & therefore the objection has much Weight, but such a vertuous Army claims the Generosity of their Country, & I am happy to find that the opposition to the Commutation has in a great Measure subsided. Indeed one Circumstance seems to have greatly increased the Opposition, the Superiority which the officers, on their Return Home, naturally assumed over their fellow Citizens, who were at least their Equals, & in many Instances Superiors before the War. Your Letter to Congress on the Necessity of providing for payment of our foreign Debts has been improved for the purpose of supporting the System of Impost, but whither it will be finally adopted by all the States is at present problematical--some of the powers of the Superintendant of Finance, were given him at a Time when the Affairs of the Treasury were greatly deranged, by the Destruction of the paper Currency, & when the Demands of Money for supporting the War were great & indispensible, but the Exercise of those Powers at the present Time is considered as being unnecessary by some of the States, & indeed as being dangerous & unconstitutional: they have therefore proposed by Instructions to their Delegates such Alterations as shall prevent the Influence apprehended from the Powers mentioned. Indeed there has been lately an Alarm in the Minds of the best Republicans amongst Us, at Measures supposed to have arisen from the Influence mentioned, connected with that of the state of P____a, & a foreign Minister thorough paced in politics. To preserve therefore the fOEderal Ballance, Congress have determined no longer to reside in this City, but to erect Buildings for their \""Residence in two places, on the Potowmack near George Town, & on the Delaware near Trenton; & untill the buildings are erected, to sit alternately at Annapolis & Trenton.\"" One fOEderal Town, it is conceived, will collect a Number of wealthy Citizens, who with some of the foreign Ministers & the great Officers of the Departments under Congress, may form an oligarchical plan of influence that may be subversive of our Liberties, but the alternate Residence of Congress in two places, will prevent in great Measure,   such a Collection, & the Influence of one Town will counteract that of the other. The Expence of the Buildings is an object of no great Consequence, & double Archives may be kept without much Expence. This Measure was effected by a Question of the eastern & southern States being violently opposed by this & some others of the middle states. I confess the Measure appears to be more approved, on Account of the quarter from whence the Opposition comes. Another Species of Influence supposed to have had its Birth in a foreign climate & to have been innocently fostered by the worthy officers of our Army, has made its appearance under the denomination of the Cincinnati. The Institution & strictures thereon are inclosed for your perusal. A peace Establishment is proposed for garrisoning our western Frontiers & guarding the Magazines, but It is doubtful whether Congress will accept the proposition. Should We have the Treasury under a SuperIntendant with power to appoint all the officers thereof; should We consent to the Impost, wch is veiwed as an intricate System for raising Supplies, without the Check constitutionally vested in the Legislatures, or the possibility of detecting Frauds in the Collection or Expenditures of the publick Monies; should We have one fOEderal Town with such Materials for an oligarchical Influence as has been mentiond; should We have a peace Establishment which by various pretences may hereafter be increased to a dangerous standing Army, not under the Controul of the respective States; should We consent to an order of Cincinnati consisting of all the Officers of the Army & Citizens of Consequence in the united States; how easy the Transition from a Republican to any other Form of Government, however despotic? & how rediculous to exchange a british Administration, for one that would be equally tyrannical, perhaps much more so? This project may answer the End of Courts that aim at making Us subservient to their political purposes, but can never be consistent with the Dignity or Happiness of the united States.  Your Resignation is not yet, & I flatter myself will not be accepted. The propriety of inserting Mr Jay & yourself in the Commissions cannot I think fail of being so considered by Congress. If there are three Commissions, the preference may be in Rotation. In the first A, J, F,4 in the second J, F, A, in the third F, A, J--& so on in more Commissions. Congress have determined on a circular Letter to the States for delegating a Power for a Time to regulate the Commerce of the union, so as to counteract the commercial Systems of G Britain or other Powers unfavorable to the States. I will endeavour if possible to comply with your request respecting Du Coudrai, shall write to Mrs Adams & give her the Information proposed, & shall be mindful of your proposals respecting Mr Thaxter: but not knowing what Number the new Congress will consist of, I can form no Conjecture of the Measures that will be adopted on any Occasion.  Mr Jay is very friendly to You having written a Letter highly in your Favour to Congress, recommended You as Minister to the Court of London, & declared his refusal of the office if offerd to him. Your Lady & Family were well about six Weeks past. Her Father died about that Time. You will please to communicate what You think expedient to Mr Jay & Mr Dana, of the preceeding scrall & be assured I am in every occasion yours sincerely, E G [P.S.] In your Letter to Congress, it may be expedient to omit Circumstancials or Minuti as your General or comprehensive Letters are most acceptable.

  Dr Sir, Belmont Novr 24. 1783.  I enclose some Papers I had intended to have sent to Council in Conjunction with my Colleagues of the last Delegation. I had given Directions for Copies & had began Several myself of some important Transactions where I thought it necessary that the State should be informed. The Subjects of the Communications intended related to the Recommendations respecting the Tories of which the Letter from Dr Franklin herewith sent is a Part but it is the one which produced the Alteration in the British Counterproject of the Treaty from a positive Stipulation to a recommendatory Article.(1) There are other Papers on this Subject calculated to elucidate the intention of the Parties & which will be necessary when Congress issue the Recommendations on the definitive Treaty. There are also Informations on the Subject of Commerce which tend to develope the present British Systems & to shew that the European Nations are more likely to make a common Cause with Britain as to the carrying & exclusive Trade & how to thwart her Plans. These will be requisite to shew that unless there is a general Power to regulate Commerce so that there shall be a Unity of System & a Decision & Energy in its Execution, our Trade will be at the Mercy of foreign Nations & of none more than our late Enemy who will let no Opportunity slip of dividing us by throwing out Baits to some, &, when she dare, Frowns & Threats to others. Many of the  NOVEMBER 24, 1783  British Papers are pompous, laboured & lengthy which prevented the whole Subject being transmitted in due Time. The Delegates ought to have contingent Money allowed for occasional Copies & other Business of the Delegation which is often neglected owing to the Engagements of Members who are either taken up with the Business of the House or averse from the Drudgery of collecting or copying Papers. The Copy of the Resolution respecting the Treaty with the Indians the Secretary of Congress directed his Clerk to send to me; but it is not done. There are some other Papers relating to Indian Affairs which ought to be laid before the Council & Assembly. If I see any of the Gentlemen of the present Delegation I will endeavour to point out particular Papers on the several Subjects I allude to. But it is necessary for them to be acquainted with the general Subjects before they will see the Force of any particular Paper or know what Parts to communicate & what are of a secret Nature. Their Attention may therefore be drawn to the Points of Information which struck me when they come to make themselves acquainted with the foreign Papers & past domestic Transactions.

  Dear Sir Philadelphia 25t November 1783  The Support of the Suffering Citizens of the North Eastern part of our State who have fled for Redress to Congress has already compelled Us to draw upon your Excellency. Having neither Authority, nor a Knowledge of any Funds in your Excellency's power to answer our wants, we adopted this Measure with Reluctance.  My own particular Situation obliges me however painful to take a further Liberty of the same nature.  You know, Sir, that it has been my misfortune to be left at different Times without any Provision by the State but ineffectual votes. While my Finances admitted it I never complained, but In June 1781 I was obliged to represent my Circumstances to the Legislature. They were pleased to order my Accounts to be adjusted by an Act passed the 30th of June. Accordingly They were settled by the  NOVEMBER 28, 1783  Auditor and a Deficiency of £74 in specie certified to be in Arrear to me of the Supplies voted for the Board of myself & servant and the keeping of two horses; which were all the Articles ever provided for by the Legislature. A deficiency so considerable when I had no means of answering any subsistance has involved me in Difficulties which I have severely felt & from which I have not yet been relieved.  Your Excellency will be pleased to recollect that at your Request I took Mr Bensen's Turn to Attend Congress with great Reluctance. I foresaw it woud expose me to expences which I could not sustain. An Additional Inconvenience has arisen from the unlucky Incident I mentiond in a former Letter. And to all this is to be added my Continuance here a Month beyond the time for which any provision has been voted.(1) I submitted because it was rendered necessary by the Important Interests of our own State which were then as yet before Congress and by the Delay of the Gentlemen appointed to relieve us.  These Circumstances will I hope in some Measure apologize for my Drawing upon your Excellency for the Sum of £124.9.0 New York Cury which I have borrowed upon the credit of the State, and which I flatter myself will be cheerfully refunded to your Excellency at the next session of the Legislature.

I took a Seat from Princeton in the Carriage of an acquaintance and have not yet provided myself with Horses. Mr Spaight tells me that he thinks a Gelding of the first quality may be purchased near Halifax @ £45 to £50. If this is the Case and if such purchases are to be made with Paper Mony I have thoughts of requesting a friend to buy for me a couple of good Horses viz for the Saddle & Port Mantua. By those means I should save 200 or more of my present hard Dlrs. for which I foresee I shall have full use before the Spring. And I should come home by Water, or at least come as far as Suffolk or Portsmouth. However if I can save mony enough to buy Horses I shall buy them to the Northward and come Home on Horseback as by far the most elegable way. I wish to attend at the Spring Sitting of the Genl. Assembly. If I should be chosen a member so much the more convenient as in that Case I may be able in my Place to explain some measures that I have much at Heart. From this distance you know that I may readily attend though I should leave Congress on the first of April.

That territory and exclusive jurisdiction in & about the place of their session is not necessary to attain these ends and would subject them to avocations from their proper objects.  3. That long experience has led the civilized nations of Europe (2) to an ascertainment of those privileges and immunities which may enable the representatives of an independant nation exercising high functions within another to do the same unawed and undisturbed and that therefore the privileges and immunities annexed by the law and usage of nations to such characters should be allowed to the Congress of the united states collectively and to their members individually by the laws of the states in and adjacent to which they may be sitting, and should be secured in their continuance by sufficient sanctions. 4. That legal provision should also be made for protecting and vindicating those privileges and immunities to which foreign ministers & others attending on Congress are entitled by the law of nations.  5. That Congress will rely on the honour and affection of the states in and adjacent to which they may be sitting as a security that measures shall be provided for preventing violations of the rights before stated in general and duly punishing them when arising too suddenly for prevention. 6. That the United States should be made capable of acquiring & holding in perpetuum such grounds and buildings in and about the place of the session of Congress as may be necessary for the transaction of business by their own body, their committees & officers, that each state should be made capable of acquiring and holding in perpetuum such ground and buildings as they may at any time think proper to acquire & erect for the personal accomodation of their delegates: and that the grounds and buildings beforementioned so long as Congress or a Committee of the states shall be resident at such place <<shall> should be exempt from taxation.  7. That as in time of war the enemies of these states might employ emissaries and spies to discover the views & proceedings of Congress, that body should have authority within a certain distance of the place of their session to arrest and deal with as they shall think proper all persons, not being citizens of any of these states nor entitled to their protection, whom they shall have cause to suspect to be spies.  8.

That during the recess of Congress the Committee of the states being left to pursue the same objects & under the same circumstances their body, their members, & their President should respectively be placed on the same footing with the body, the members & the President of Congress.(3) ""

  Dr. Sir, Philadelphia Decr. 3d. 1783. The late President of this State, Joseph Reed Esqr. who is bound to London and intends to make the tour of Holland and France, a few days ago honoured me with a visit, and with an offer to convey a letter to you. Although I had lately written by Capt. John Paul Jones,(1) and have now nothing material to communicate to you; yet that friendship I have ever entertained for you constrains me again to take up my pen.  I have heard nothing from Cambridge since I wrote to you by Capt. Jones. The family I now repeat was then well. Mrs. Dana (2) had for some time pleased herself with the fond hope of seeing you this fall; but her expectation, as she wrote me, was frustrated; and on that account, on account of her not receiving that part of your salary which you had appropriated to the support of the family, and because your Sister was determined to be married this fall she was much distressed. Agreeably to her request I have inquired of the Register of the public accounts what warrants had issued for your salary, and find that your account has been settled up to the 30th of Sept. last; and that a warrant for the last 6 months, ending the 30th of Sept., and amounting to 2,222 20/90 dollars, had been forwarded to Mr. N. Tracey. I communicated this information to her in a letter full of consolation. The warrant could not, I think, have reached Mr. Tracey when Mrs. Dana's letter was dated; and I am sure he is a gentleman of too much honour not to comply with your direction as soon as the warrant shall have been paid.  In making this inquiry I took such steps as should exclude the most distant idea of a suspicion of any impropriety in his conduct; and I ventured to give her a hint to act cautiously on her part.  Mr. Thaxter arrived here, via N. York, with the long-expected definitive treaty, last Saturday week. I have seen him and had the pleasure of being informed that, not long before he left Paris, which I think was the 26th or 29th of Sept., he had heard of your welfare. The difficulties which have attended your mission are before this time, I presume,  DECEMBER 3, 1783  removed, and you have been acknowledged in your public character. This may occasion your continuing at the Court of St. Petersburg this winter; but will not I hope prevent your returning next Summer.  It seems to be the opinion of Congress not to employ hereafter more than two ministers abroad, one at the Court of Versailles and the other at the Court of London. Mr. Jay is talked of for the first and Mr. Adams for the last; but I cannot say with certainty who will be appointed. At some other Courts we may have residents, or agents, or consuls. Our finances will not admit of maintaining many ministers abroad; and if they would perhaps they might do as much hurt as good. As soon as a minister shall be appointed for the court of London, we may expect one from thence; and then we shall doubtless have an abundance of pretious intriguing. We shall not I imagine soon forget the favours we have received from our great and good ally; but interest you know governs the world.  The order of the British King in Council prohibiting any trade to the B. W. Indias but in B. bottoms, has created great uneasiness; and it seems that our trade to the F. W. Indias is restrained. That nation which discovers the most favorable disposition toward our commerce will probably be most regarded by us. Whether the Dutch will copy after the French & British and not permit a trade to their ports on the continent of America & to St. Eustatius is uncertain; but it is my opinion that they will avail themselves of the blunders of others, and give us a free trade.  Good policy dictates that we should form commercial treaties with all commercial States, where reciprocity can be obtained, and I suppose will be pursued. I am not sufficiently acquainted with the advantages that might result from a trade with Russia, to determin whether we ought to court it or not; but certainly the more channels the stream of our commerce runs in the greater will be the prospect of gain, the less will be the danger of our being injured by any partial obstructions, and the more may that spirit of enterprize be gratified which springs from and is favorable to liberty. The thirteen stripes will in the course of a year, fly on the coasts of China, and hereafter be displayed wherever Seas shall roll to waft our ships.  If the U. S. in Congress assembled should recommend to the several States to lay heavy imposts upon goods imported from and exported to the B. W. Indias, in B. bottoms, it might perhaps bring Britain to reason; but commerce you know is a coy dame that must be handled delicately.  The present system of finance is founded intirely upon the recommendation for an impost. This State and the State of Massachusetts have complied with it fully; some others partially and some have not as yet taken the recommendation into their consideration. The State of R. Island &c will be the last that adopts it. She knows that it will be   against her particular interest to collect monies on her trade not to be appropriated to the payment of her quota of the public debt, and she conceives that committing her purse strings to the hands of Congress may prove dangerous to her liberty. You may have seen Genl. Washington's farewell letter to the States,(3) which somebody, in a Pennsylvania paper confidently pronounced was dictated by the immediate Spirit of God. That letter aided by a letter from Mr. Adams to Congress, part of which have been transmitted to the States,(4) induced, as I believe, the State of Massachusetts to embrace the impost.  Mr. Adams urged the necessity of establishing public credit, of commercial regulations, and of bracing up the confOEderation. The confOEderation without doubt ought to be preserved in full vigour. There is not the least danger that its strings will be relaxed; but a bold hand might, in attempting to serve them up to the highest pitch, snap them, and then where should we be? All harmony would be at an end. There are some among us who are desirous of augmenting the powers of Congress, and the State of N. York sometime ago proposed a convention of the States to form a new confederation.(5) Part of the last article of ConfOEderation runs in these words. \""And the articles of this confOEderation shall be inviolably observed by every State and the union shall be perpetual.\"" Is it not somewhat surprizing that in so short a space of time, as hath intervened between the ratification of confOEderation and the present moment, it should appear to be so insufficient as that a new one should be thought necessary.  A fondness for power is natural to man, and property and dominion are closely connected. I could say much on this subject but Cynthia vellet aurim; and verbum sapienti satest.(6) It seems that some of our ministers at Paris do not perfectly agree. One writing of another says, that he is always a honest man, often a wise man, but sometimes absolutely out of his senses. It is very clever to be always honest, and often wise; and some slight errors in such a character might be over-looked, or pardoned; but certainly a minister should never be absolutely out of his senses. One of the greatest ministers in the world was as I remember charged with insanity. There are some sublime strokes in politicks which to some men appear to be mad and extravagant; and there are some philosophers, who, if they could bear a rival in the chair, cannot bear to be outstripped in any science. Mr. Adams is I think a great politician. The happy coincidence in opinion of two of our plenipo's hath produced the most beneficial effects; and the names of ______ and ______ will go down to posterity with honour. It may have been well for you that you have not had an associate; perhaps, if you had, you might not have jumped in judgement, and then some evil might have been spoken of you. I have heard many men of sense speak well of your con-  duct of the correspondence with the Chancellor of Russia, and I have never heard you blamed but for your patiences. It is confessedly impossible to form a right judgment of the conduct of a public man at a distance; and yet some men will assume to pass a judgment upon it too peremptorily. A certain late Secretary for foreign affairs, was prettily chastised by certain ministers for certain reprobatory hints.(7) Courts are schools to learn patience in; and you & Mr. Jay I think have not proved bad scholars.  Mr. Jay has leave to go to Bath for his health. Dr. Franklin hath offer'd a resignation of his office on account of his old age. I suppose it will be accepted soon after Congress shall have met at Annapolis in Maryland, the place to which Congress is adjourned. I wrote you, I believe, in my letter by Capt. Jones, that Congress had resolved upon two places of permanent residence, one on the banks of Potowmack near George Town in Maryland, the other on the banks of Delaware near Trenton. How the idea of two fOEderal towns, as they are called in the resolution, will strike you, will strike Europe I cannot tell. The wits of this city have diverted themselves exceedingly with this measure. Any thing, even the most serious things may be ridiculed, especially when wits are sharpend by disappointment. The Eastern States came into this plan, to accommodate the Southern Gentlemen, and to avoid being whirled into the vortex of Philadelphia as the cant expression goes. Whether we shall have any permanent place of residence or not is uncertain; but I do not see at present the absurdity of Congress sitting at two or three places alternately. It would be attended with some inconveniences; but it might be attended with ballancing advantages. There has been much talk about the jurisdiction that Congress should exercise in the place or places where it may reside; but nothing has been determined.(8) I don't know that the assembly of the States, of the United Netherlands, or of the Swiss cantons, hath any jurisdiction over the towns where it resides.  A peace or rather a military establishment hath been long on the tapis. I believe it will not be speedily agreed to. It involves an important question, to wit, whether Congress are invested with power by the confOEderation to erect a military establishment in a time of peace. Some hold the affirmative of this question, others on the same side fearful of confOEderation ground pass over it and talk of certain implied, inherent powers which they say reside in every supreme power.  It may be necessary to maintain some temporary posts to secure the lands, become dependent on the States by the peace and by cessions of the States of N. York & Virginia, from intruders and to check the Indians, but from a standing army in time of peace Good Lord deliver us. Congress have accepted the cession of Virginia with some alterations, which, it is imagined, will be acceded to. Presuming on this and on a purchase of the Indian right Congress have agreed to lay out   a State, to be disposed of to the officers and soldiers of the army in payment of the debt due to them. A treaty is to be held with the Indians for the purposes of making peace with them, and a purchase of their right to the soil.  It is said by good judges that the tract acquired as aforesaid comprehends five hundred thousand square miles; and some men who are acquainted with that country assert that the value of it is sufficient to discharge our whole public debt. If this be true there can be no necessity for the proposed impost.  The settlement of public accounts proceeds very slowly. Some think that obstructions are suffer'd or thrown in the way to force down the Impost. Our affairs are in an unsettled state; but if the confOEderation is adhered to, and hath a fair and full operation I trust all will come out right.  Eastern politics are still republican, the Southern it is said verge towards Aristocrasy.  As you may not have heard of an institution which probably may make some noise in the U. States, I shall take leave to introduce to you The Society of the Cincinnati lately instituted by the M. Genls. and the Br. Genls. and other Offrs. of the American army.  They have a Genl. Society and a State Society established in each State, and these again subdivided into such districts, as shall be directed by the State societies. The Genl. meeting of the Society is to consist of its officers, and a representation from each State in number not exceeding five. They have a badge of honour or what they call an order by which its members shall be known and distinguished. It is a medal of Gold in the figure of an eagle with an inscription on the face & reverse alluding to the time of establishing the order, and to their having saved the republic. It is to be suspended by a deep blue ribbon two inches wide edged with white descriptive of the Union between America & France. They have conferred the honour & freedom of their order on several foreigners. Genl. Washington is president of the Society.  By their circular letter it is nothing more than an \""Association, Constitution and combination of the Generals & other officers of the army who have served three years or were deranged by Congress into a Society of friends to perpetuate the memory of the Revolution, and their own mutual friendship, to endure as long as they shall endure, or any of their eldest male posterity: and in failure thereof, the collateral branches who may be judged worthy of becoming its supporters & members: To attend incessantly to preserve inviolate the exalted rights and liberties of human nature; for which they fought and bled; To promote & cherish between the respective States union and national honour: To render permanent, cordial affection and the spirit of brotherly kindness among the officers: To extend acts of benificence towards those officers and their families who may unfortu-  nately be under the necessity of receiving it.\"" They advance each a month's pay, and open a door for donations from others not of the Society, and for the charitable purpose of raising a fund as well as for the political one of engaging the leading men of each State in the interests of the order, they have the following rule: \""And as there will at all times be men in the respective States eminent for their abilities and patriotism, whose views may be directed to the same laudable objects with those of the Cincinnati; it shall be a rule to admit such characters as honorary members of the Society for their own lives only: Provided that the number of the honorary members does not exceed a ratio of one to four of the officers and their descendents.\"" The quotations I have made are the words of the Genl. Association so that it seems to be the offspring of patriotism, friendship, and humanity. This account of the Cincinnati is taken from a peice signed Cassius and supposed to be written by Ædanus Burke Esqr. one of the chief justices of the State of So. Carolina, intitled \""Considerations on the Society or Order of Cincinnati; lately instituted by the Major Generals, Brigadier-Generals, and other officers of the American Army. Proving that it creates a race of hereditary Patricians or Nobility. Interspersed with remarks on its consequences to the freedom and happiness of the Republic. Addressed to the People of South Carolina, and their Representatives.\""(9) The motto is \""blow ye the trumpet in Zion.\"" Cassius is mistaken in calling Major General Baron Steuben President; Genl. Washington I am well informed is at the head of this Society, and therefore I have so far alterd his account. The President of this State John Dickinson Esqr. and the Super-intendant of finance are honorary members.  This peice is keenly written, and I believe that the blast of Cassius's trumpet will alarm the continent.(10) He says \""it is in reality and will turn out to be an hereditary peerage; a nobility to them and their male issue, and in default thereof to the collateral branches: what the lawyers would call--A title of peerage of Cincinnati to them and their heirs male, remainder to their heirs general.\"" That \""the order of Cincinnati usurp a nobility without gift or grant, in defiance of Congress and the States.\"" That \""the order is self created and an infringement of the general law of the union.\"" That this order is planted in a fiery, hot ambition and thirst of power; and its branches will end in tyranny.\"" That \""The Cincinnati will soon be corrupted and the spirit of the people depressed; for in less than a century it will occasion such an inequality in the condition of our inhabitants, that the country will be composed only of two ranks of men the patricians or nobles, and the rabble.\"" He says \""I have the honour to tell Baron Steuben, that though an order of peerage may do very well under the petty princes of Germany; yet in America it is incompatible with our freedom; and instead of a bond of political union, it would on a future day prove a source of civil dissension   and misery: by establishing two distinct orders, one whose foundation is the Army; the other composed of the Commonalty. With what propriety can they denominate themselves from Cincinnatus with an ambition so rank as to aim at nothing less, than otium cum digni dignitate 'retirement and a peerage': Did that virtuous Roman, having subdued the enemies of his country and returned home to tend his vineyard and plant cabbages, did he confer an hereditary order of peerage on himself and his fellow soldiers? I answer, No; it was more than he dared to do. For a less crime, that republic, in the days of its liberty, put to death, banished or disgraced some of her citizens; as illustrious and renowned as any we have without exception.\"" He observes \""that military commanders, acquiring fame, and accustomed to receive the obedience of armies, are generally in their hearts aristocratics, and enemies to the popular equality of the republic.\"" \""The number of the peers of the order reckoning honorary members cannot be far short of ten thousand: and as they will be the principal men in America, to suppose that each can, by his influence, procure two or three followers who will adhere to his interest and service, is a reasonable calculation. Here is a body of 20 or 30,000 men immediately; and every generation will be adding to the number.\"" I am tired with making extracts. I would send you the pamphlet if I knew it would not subject you to a heavy postage. To crush this order he proposes that \""the legislature should immediately enter into spirited resolutions against it: let them tell the order, and the world, that however pious or patriotick in the pretence, yet any political combination of military commanders is, in a republican government extremely hazardous and highly censurable. But that instituting exclusive honours and privileges of an Hereditary order, is a daring usurpation on the sovereignty of the republic: a dangerous insult to the rights and liberties of the people, and a fatal stab to that principle of equality, which forms the basis of our government; to establish which the people fought and bled as well as the Cincinnati; though the latter are now taking every measure to rob them of the credit and fruits of it. If this would not do, and the order still go on yet such a resolve would have a good effect.\"" Cassius has not taken particular notice of the magnitude of the fund which a month's pay of each officer in the Cincinnati, with donations, would create in a short space of time. I recollect that when we are [were] at York Town, and about the time the affair of half pay was on the carpet, to have seen a manuscript in the hand of Secretary Thompson, said to have come from camp, in which it was proposed that titles of nobility should be given to our principal officers.(11) Some months ago a polite letter from the Seretary of the Order of Divine Providence, lately instituted in Poland, came to Congress, through the hands of Genl Washington, complimenting Congress with the nomination of 24 members of that   order. The letter was referred to a Committee, of which I was one, and they reported, in substance, that any such nomination would be against confOEderation.(12) Business of more importance had prevented the report being considered before Congress adjourned.  The half pay and the commutation of it for five years whole pay is very disagreable to the Eastern States; and hath caused great disturbances, especially in Connecticut. Their lower house of Assembly would not agree to the recommendation for an impost, without a clause in their act providing that no part of the money collected by the Impost should go towards a payment of the Commutation. The council were for it in toto and without alteration. This gave such dissatisfaction to the freemen that the Govr., Dep. Govr., and several of the Council are left out of the nomination for the next election. Since writing the foregoing I have received a letter from Mr. Channing,(13) dated Novr. 9th. 1783 in which he says \""Nancy has returned from Cambridge and Almy has taken her place. The judge she informs me enjoys a tolerable state of health considering his old age; but he is now confining himself on account of the Measles. Lydia and Capt. Hastings are to be made one the morrow evening, they were published before Nancy left Cambridge. Mrs. Dana, her children and Trowbridge were well.\""  I am here in my way to Annapolis. I left home the beginning of last June and expect to continue in Congress until the next June, the business of Mr. Marchant, who was to relieve me, not permitting him to come on. Give me leave to expect the pleasure of a letter from you. I thing [think] this long epistle will entitle me to that favour, unless you should be about returning home when you receive this. That a kind Providence may preserve and protect you, and return you in health to your family and friends is the fervent prayer of your affectionate friend. William Ellery  P.S. To sweeten Philadelphia as well as because they had a right to it General Mifflin was unanimously chosen President for the present year. Your Newport friends are all well.

 Thomas Jefferson to George Rogers Clark Dear Sir Annapolis Dec. 4. 1783. I received here about a week ago your obliging letter of Oct 12. 1783. with the shells and seeds for which I return you many thanks. You are also so kind as to keep alive the hope of getting for me as many of the different species of bones, teeth and tusks of the Mammoth as can now be found. This will be most acceptable. Pittsburg and Philadelphia or Winchester will be the surest channel of conveyance. I find they have subscribed a very large sum of money in England for exploring the country from the Missisipi to California. They pretend it is only to promote knolege. I am afraid they have thoughts of colonising into that quarter. Some of us have been talking here in a feeble way of making the attempt to search that country. But I doubt whether we have enough of that kind of spirit to raise the money. How would you like to lead such a party? Tho I am afraid our prospect is not worth asking the question. The definitive treaty of peace is at length arrived. It is not altered from the preliminaries. The cession of the territory West of Ohio to the United states has been at length accepted by Congress with some small alterations of the conditions. We are in daily expectation of receiving it with the final approbation of Virginia. Congress have been lately agitated by questions where they should fix their residence. They first resolved on Trentown. The Southern states however contrived to get a vote that they would give half their time to Georgetown at the Falls of Patowmac. Still we consider the matter as undecided between the Delaware and Patowmac.  DECEMBER 4, 1783  We urge the latter as the only point of union which can cement us to our Western friends when they shall be formed into separate states.(1) I shall always be happy to hear from you and am with very particular esteem Dr. Sir Your friend & humble servt., Th: Jefferson ""

  Sir Annapolis Dec. 5. 1783.  Your very obliging letter of Nov. 22. was put into my hands just in the moment of my departure from Philadelphia, which put it out of my power to acknolege in the same instant my obligations for the charge you were so kind as to undertake of presenting a French tutor to my daughter and for the very friendly dispositions and attentions you flatter me with. The same cause prevented my procuring her the books you were so kind as to recommend, but this shall be supplied by orders from hence. I had left with her a Gil Blas, and Don Quichotte which are among the best books of their class as far as I am acquainted with them. The plan of reading which I have formed for her is considerably different from what I think would be most proper for her sex in any other country than America. I am obliged in it to extend my views beyond herself, and consider her as possibly at the head of a little family of her own. The chance that in marriage she will draw a blockhead I calculate at about fourteen to one, and of course that the education of her family will probably rest on her own ideas and direction without assistance. With the best poets and prosewriters I shall therefore combine a certain extent of reading in the graver sciences. However I scarcely expect to enter her on this till she returns to me. Her time in Philadelphia will be chiefly occupied in acquiring a little taste and execution in such of the fine arts as she could not prosecute to equal advantage in a more retired situation. We have yet but four states in Congress. I think when we are assembled we shall propose to dispatch the most urging and important business, and, putting by what may wait, separate and return to our respective states, leaving only a Committee of the states. The constant session of Congress can not be necessary in time of peace, and their separation will destroy the strange idea of their being a permanent body, which has unaccountably taken possession of the heads of their constituents, and occasions jealousies injurious to the public good.  DECEMBER 5, 1783  I have the honour of being with very perfect esteem & respect Sir Your most obedient & most humble servt., Th: Jefferson ""

  Annapolis Decemr. 7th. 1783  I should have done myself the Pleasure of writing to you before this Time: But since joining Congress, we have been in an unsettled Posture--little other Business has been done than that of determining a Place, or Places, for the future Residence of Congress. The Discussion of these Questions bro't into view many others, of great Importance. The Decissions of Congress, you are undoubtedly acquainted with, respecting their future Residences. But you may probably be uninform'd, as to the Motives & Reasons, that operated in the Minds of the Delegates of several of the States, to agree to Measures, that seem to be attended with no inconsiderable Inconveniency on several Accounts. They are such, as have made the Measure unpopular to all those, who are not capable of discerning the absolute Necessity of placing Congress in a Situation, that will have the greatest Tendency to make them a free & independent Body--& it is more especially disagreeable to those who have long had a settled Plan of placing Congress in a Situation, where it would be morally impossible that they should not be fettered & shackled with an Influence, that would absolutely controul all their Measures. The Simplicity of the first Class, will operate powerfully in Support of the second, who, possess'd of no small Share of Cunning & Address, will use all their Endeavors to keep out of Sight the true Reasons of the Measure, & at the same Time place it in such a Point of Light, as to create strong Prejudices against it in the Minds of the uninformed & unthinking Part of the Society, who are too apt, for the Sake of a little present Relief, to reject Plans that would have a Tendency to secure to them very great future Advantages.  When Ignorance & Cunning are combined, as is frequently the Case, against wise & politic Measures, hard is the Task of the Man, who is honestly endeavoring to oppose the Systematical Intrigue of a few, by Reasons of public utility & Propriety. This may be the Situation of those Members of Congress, who have supported the Propositions for two permanent Places, at which the Residence of Congress shall be alternately equal. The Objections against it are easily addressed, & of such a Nature as will at once make sensible Impressions upon the Popular Party; or rather those who do not look beyond the present Day,  DECEMBER 7, 1783  nor consider the Necessity of securing to Posterity the Blessings which are at their Disposal. There are several Weighty Reasons to support the late Decissions of Congress. It was necessary to accommodate the several Parts of the Continent, some of which were greatly agitated, & dissatisfied with the first Determination of Congress. It was necessary in Order to destroy Systems, which would finally have ended in absolute Aristocracy--the Effects of which have been too apparent for several Years past. It would not have been possible that Congress should ever have been a free & independent Body in the City of P____a. Plans for absolute Government, for deceiving the lower Classes of People, for introducing undue Influence, for any Kind of Government, in which Democracy has the least possible Share, originate, are cherished & disseminated from thence.  With Respect to accommodating the several States in the Union, it is a Matter of absolute Necessity. The seven eastern States may, by the Iron Hand of voting, carry the Seat of Congress much more Northward than it really ought to be, & accommodate themselves very well. But it is unnatural to suppose that the Southern states would chearfully submit to such a Decission; they openly declare that they cannot, and will not; and as a fOEderal Town cannot be erected without their Concurrence; the final Event must have been, that Congress would have again fallen into the City of P____a, & there remained, until the several States for Want of Confidence in them, should have voluntarily put an End to their Existence; which, without pretending to have the Gift of Prophesying, one might easily foresee would not be a very distant Period. As to the Matter of travelling one or two hundred Miles farther, it is of no Weight. The Climate has some. But if Congress can dispatch all their Business in the Fall & Winter, which they certainly may do in future, Our pointed Objection against a southern Climate will not exist at those Seasons of the Year. I am therefore fully of the Opinion that public Harmony & Concord are Objects of no small Consequence in the Union & that private Inconvenience ought always to give Way to them.  That Systems of Intrigue & Influence have been laid, that they are too strongly rooted already, is but too well known to those who have had a Share in public Business for these several Years past. A Recital of the various Measures & ManOEuvres, that tend to corroborate the Opinion, would be too tedious for a Letter. I need only say, that the sensible Part of those who are deeply engaged in the intrigueing plans, are most violent against the Decission of Congress, respecting two Places of Residence, that they have ever since, had strongly marked in their Countenances, an evident Air of Dejection. Their unexpected disappointment seems to have irritated them much, & we must be prepared to meet a Torrent of Abuse & many scurrilous Observations. The Prostitutes to Influence are capable frequently of mak-  ing the wrong seem to be Right. But with a Jealous, well informed People, Truth will prevail; & there is little Danger of their condemning honest, well meant Endeavors to serve them.  The System of Influence began, when the United States were reduced to the most deplorable Situation, on Account of their Finances; when the virtuous Spirit of the People began to Subside, & when among many an Indifference to the Cause began to be too manifest. At this fatal Moment the eagle eyed Politician of our great Ally, discovered the absolute Importance of the Aid of his Master, & the critical Situation of the United States. It was then he ventured to propose that Congress should subject their Peace Commissioners to the absolute controul of a foreign Court. It was then found to be necessary to establish Ministers of State, a Financier, a Secretary at War, & a Secretary for foreign Affairs. It was necessary to place Congress in a Situation before the Close of the War that the Members of that Body, excepting a chosen few, should know little or nothing of the Negociations abroad. It was necessary to create an Office of foreign Affairs, & that the Chevalier & his Secretary should be the Persons behind the Scene to manage & direct all the Measures there of. In the Beginning of the year 1781 Congress found themselves extremely embarass'd--they had no money, nor any Credit--the southern States were some of them abandonned to, & others of them overrun by the Enemy. The Delegates from those States found it impractible for the eastern States to afford them much Assistance; & some from Despair of other Means, & others probably from less virtuous Motives, agreed to give up the united States to foreign Power, perswading themselves & endeavoring to perswade others, that disinterested Benevolence alone, was the Principle from which that Court always acted. All homage was due & it became Treason to speak, think or even look, as if one suppos'd it possible that she should do us an Injury, or act from interested Motives. The Weakness & the Wickedness of the southern States placed the united States in a most humiliating Situation, opend the Door of Intrigue, which has been disclosing more & more every year Since. I have no Doubt their Object was to [...] their own Country; & for this Purpose, they became humble devoted Worshippers of the golden Image--And every Person that did not flatter, & dance Attendance as much as they, was immediately [set] down as having a contracted, illiberal Mind. Attention and a smile elated the one Party, whilst a cold formal Reception & often a pointed Neglect, markd evidently the point of Light In which the other was viewed. In this Situation was Congress, when the great Officers of State commenced. The Financier & Secretary for foreign Affairs (1) were admirably well adapted to support, and not only so, but to become the principal Engines of Intrigue. The first mentioned Officer, is a Man of inflexible Perseverance. He Judges well in almost all Money Matters;   and mercantile Transactions. He well knows what is necessary to support public Credit. But never thinks it necessary to secure the Confidence of the People, by making Measures palatable to them. A Man destitute of every Kind of theoretic Knowledge; but from extensive mercantile Negociations, he is a good practical Merchant; more than this cannot be said with Justice. He Judges generally for himself; and acts with great Decision. He has many excellent Qualities for a Financier, which however do not comport so well with Republicanism, as Monarchy. Ambitious of becoming the first Man in the united States, he was not so delicate in the Choice of Means, and Men for his Purpose, as is indispensably necessary in a free Government. The good Ally of the united States could assist him in Money, & he was heartily dispos'd to make her very grateful Returns. The United States abound with Men absolutely devoted. With such a Financier and with such Materials, it is easy to conceive what an amazing Power he would soon acquire. He stood in need of foreign Support, & they stood in need of him; thus far the political Machinery was in Unison, and republicanism grated harsh Discords.  The Secretary for foreign Affairs was a Man of more acquired Knowledge, and less natural Ability. A Person as completely devoted to promote all the Views and Wishes of our good Ally, as his Minister and Secretary could possibly be. His Office was misterious, & secret to all those, who ought to have a perfect Knowledge of all it contain'd. It was undoubtedly public to all those, to whom it ought to have been a profound Secret. Two foreigners were private Secretaries in that Office; one of which it is probable was <<a Disciple of the Sarbonne> educated a Jesuit, the other had been a french Priest.(2) With this Arrangement, it is impossible to suppose that any Thing of Importance, would not be communicated immediately to such as the Interest of the united States required, should not know it. More real Injury resulted from this Arrangement, than could possibly have done, if there had been no Office and no pretended Secrets. It was a Snare to our faithful foreign Ministers, and a secure Asylum, to such as were dispos'd to prostrate the Honor & Dignity of the United States, before the polluted Shrine of Monarchy. In this Situation it was impossible to support an honest Man; All our foreign Ministers, excepting one, have felt very severely the Effects of this unaccountable System. It is strange that so many, who seem to be republicans, were so easily drawn into the Snare, and that they either could not, or would not see, that it was giving up at once, all the Priviledges for the Preservation of which we had freely lavish'd our Blood & Treasure.  It was fortunate for the United States, that the Secretary at War,(3) was a true Republican, and totally oppos'd to Intrigue & aristocratical Measures--had Genl. Schuyler, who nearly carried the Choice, been plac'd in that Office, It is a great Question in my Mind, whether it   would have been practicable for Congress, to have disbanded their Army. The Financier only wanted a Person in that Office who would go any Lengths with him: a Number of Officers as well as Citizens were ripe for the Measure. It had undoubtedly been deliberately digested--And the Finance Office was probably the Center of Motion. I am well informed that an Attempt was made to draw in the late Secretary at War--But he checkd it with a Firmness, that will always do him Honor. Such a Triumvirate, would have been too powerful for the United States; and Heaven only knows what Kind of a Form our fOEderal Government would have assum'd. The present, by that Party, is held in the utmost Detestation, & they will persevere inflexibly in their Attempts for any Alteration, by Intrigue, & by open Force, when Matters are matured, & promise more Success, than at present.  These Plans, in which our good Allies, were undoubtedly more than idle Spectators, originated in the Beginning of the year 1781 & operated fully before the End of the Year. Having given you a general View of the prevailing politics of Congress at that Time, I hope it will not be altogether useless to communicate to you, as far as my Memory serves me, The Reasons that were urged in Support of several important Decisions of Congress respecting our foreign Ministers. The first took Place in June 1781 a few Days before I Join'd that Body. It respected your Commission for Peace.4 The Business was all matured before I arrived, therefore I am not well able to say, what suggested to Congress the Idea of an Alteration. However I had not to look any farther, to satisfy myself, after I had perused the several Letters that pass'd between you & the C. de V____s respecting the Resolutions of Congress of the 18th of March 1780; & also the Publication of your Commission, for a commercial Treaty with great Britain. That you might be restricted as to the free exercise of your own Judgment; If Nature had not made you servile & submissive, it was expedient that you should [be] <<made so it possible> pointedly instructed. I find by the secret Journals, that after New Instructions were made out for you alone, before the final Completion, the Report was recommitted, with Directions to the Committee to confer with the Chevalier. I find the Committee reported to Congress several Amendments propos'd by him, the most material of which was \""and you are ultimately to govern yourself by the Advice of the Minister of his most Christian Majesty,\"" &ca. The Amendments were all said to be carried in the affirmative; the yeas & nays on the above Clause, shew that there were but Eight States in Favor of it. And it has always been a Question whether the Instructions were valid, as nine States never agreed to them and the Confederation requires the Assent of nine States, on all Questions relating to Treaties. But it was not sufficient to let it rest here; A Treaty of Peace was a very important Matter to the united States; too much so, to be committed to any Individual. Two great Objects in that Treaty, would be, the Fishery & western Ter-  ritory: & local Views might operate too powerfully in the Mind of a single Person: He would certainly urge that most, which would be most beneficial to the Part of the Continent from which he might happen to be taken. The Ultimata with Respect to the Limits of the united States agreed upon in 1778 or 1779 being repeated, there was some Reason, why there should be more than one Peace Commissioner, Indeed there would have been a very good Reason for it, considering the general Terms of the last Instructions, had not that humiliating Clause been inserted, which made all our Peace Commissioners a mere Cypher. The Names of those Commrs. who nobly dared to act contrary to the Intention of that inglorious Restriction will be immortalized, by every true American. Congress having agreed upon five Commissrs, The infamous Instructions made out for you, were adopted verbatim for the five--And the Objectionable Parts were warmly debated again in Congress. However Eight States agreed to them; & it is a very great Misfortune at this Time, that we cannot from the Journals, show that there were no more, the Yeas & Nays not being call'd. That there were no more, I am sure as an Individual, having the Names of the Persons who were willing to submit their dearest Interests to Judges deeply concern'd in the Decision. It was objected at the Time, that Eight States were not competent to pass such Instructions & that the Articles of ConfOEderation invested no Power in Congress by which they could make a foreign Court the Arbiter of Peace or War for the united States. I have as yet no Reason to alter my Opinion, which is, that both were unconstitutional. To make War nine States are necessary: but the Confederation is not as explicit respecting the making of Peace. It is held by some, that seven States only are necessary, and some who assisted in framing the Confederation, say, that this was the Idea of the Framers--But an Idea so replete with Inconsistency, seems to me Inadmissable. The Purport of the Instructions, which containd those degrading Restrictions you are fully acquainted with; but by what I have collected from Mr. T____r,(5) you are not so fully acquainted with some Endeavors in Congress to procure a Repeal of those Objectionable Parts. After the C. deV____s was made acquainted with the unbounded Confidence, that Congress by those Instructions placed in the Ministers of his most Christian Majesty, he wrote to Congress, in the Name of his Master, a Letter expressing the Satisfaction that the Confidence gave, & the Moderation that would be discovered in the Use of the Power; that all his Exertions would be to promote the Welfare of his Ally. But intimates, that he has been informed that the Measure was not unanimously agreed to in Congress. And that if the Want of unanimity is likely to produce any Division in Congress, that may tend to destroy the Union & Harmony of that Body, he would willingly relinquish a Deposit, so delicate in its Nature, & of such great Importance. He suggests the fresh Obligations his Master is laid under, by this confidential Commission, to render every   possible Service to the United States. But if Congress should see fit to withdraw the Power, the Obligation will be lessened, and the United States must in Consequence thereof, be particularly attentive to their own Interests--The Meaning of which, needs no Comment. If I do not misremember the above is nearly the Purport of the Letter. Notwithstanding this, in the Space of fifteen Months, three several Attempts were made in Congress, to revise & alter those Instructions; But to no Purpose. Those who severely reprobated them, were not clear, that it was expedient to withdraw them. It had become a Matter of Delicacy, & the Situation of the United States, was not so happy, as to encourage them to do an act that would probably wound the feelings, if not give great Offence to the C. de V____s. I am not uneasy now, that the Power was not withdrawn. I am happy that the Intention of the Instructions were gloriously eluded.  I have Reason to beleive, that those Members who warmly supported the Measure at first, have been made to fear the Resentment of the united States. They have endeavored to explain to Congress the Reasons of the Measure. They offer no better, than the extremely exhausted Situation of the Country at that Time, & the Despondency, evident from the small Exertions of all the States. Doctor Witherspoon has been candid enough on the floor of Congress, to hint at a better Reason, which was, your obstinate Dispute with the C. de V____s.(6) I have always suppos'd, that the object was to clip your Wings, & make you more tame & docile; & that if they had at first adopted the Idea of having five Commissioners, they would not have made them mere Spectators.  After the Provisional Treaty arriv'd, some were heartily pleas'd, and others discovered a Degree of Mortification. It was that our Commrs. acted for themselves--that they put a proper & rational Construction upon their Instructions. But it was said that they had grossly disobeyed them--That the Court of F____e must unavoidably be extremely irritated; that instead of making the most confidential & unreserved Communications to, & instead of being governed in the least by the Advice of the Ministers of his most C____ M____. They had made, & signed a Treaty, without their Knowledge or Concurrence--not only so they had entered into a private Stipulation with the Minister of great Britain of little or no Consequence to the United States, as pointedly against the Court of Madrid, as it was in favor of G____ B____n. It was not only unwise to encourage G____ B____n to carry war into the Floridas, but it was an extraordinary, & unnatural Disobedience of Instructions. Our Commissioners must be immediately censured, & positively directed to communicate the secret Article; otherwise Congress would become Partners in their criminal Secrecy. These Observations did not operate so as to ensure the Party of Success, in a censuring Resolution. It was tempered--A Proposition was made expressing the great Satisfaction of Congress in the Conduct of their   Commrs. and obliquely censuring them, for that Secret Article. This was not palatable. It was then said that his most C____ M____ had instructed his Minister here, to remonstrate to Congress in severe Terms, against the Conduct of our Commrs; & that Congress would act wisely, to anticipate the Business--But this had no better Effect--& the Matter subsided.(7) It was a Matter of Surprize and Astonishment to the Franklinites, that the God of Electricity consented to act with you secretly. However, if I might be allowed to form an Opinion, it would be, that the electrical Machine discharged itself invisibly--for where there is unbounded Confidence, surely there is no Reason for the least Reserve. He does not consider his most C____ M____ as an Ally, but as a Father to the United States whenever he mentions him it is in this Light.  The next act of Congress of Consequence, was the recalling your Commission for entering into a commercial Treaty with G. B. The Debates upon this Question were not so warm, & lengthy as upon the above. The principal Reason that was urged, for taking it from you, was that there were in Effect two Commissions for the same Purpose: It was insisted upon, that the Ministers for Peace were empowered by their Commission to make such Commercial Stipulations in a Treaty of Peace, as should be found necessary--that this virtually repealed the Commission to you--To set the Matter in a clear Point of Light, that there might be no Interference in the Negociations, that the Business might be all done in Concert, seven States revoked your Commission. These were some of the Observations made Use of at the Time. But I suppos'd then, & am more confirmed in my Opinion now, that it was a foreign ManOEuvre, not merely to mortify you, but the real Intention at that Time was, to have no Commercial Treaty with G____ B____n. This Sentiment prevail'd very much at that Time; And it is not destitute of warm Advocates now. It is the same with Respect to a commercial Treaty with the Court of St. Petersburgh. It has been too apparent, that the Court of Verseilles are very anxious to confine our Trade as much, as possible, to themselves. It was not till some Time after this Event, that the Delegates of Mass'tts in examining the Instructions to which the Peace Commrs. were referred, as containing the Expectations & Wishes of Congress, found that not a single Word respecting the Fishery, was to be found therein. This obliged them to move for the Instruction that afterwards pass'd respecting the same, which was long before Congress, & met with an unaccountable Opposition: the Reason is probably containd in a Letter Mr J____ transmitted to Congress.(8) It may not be useless to make some Observations upon this Letter. It contained Sentiments which were suppos'd by some to be predominant in that Persons Mind, before the Reception of it. It was an unexpected and extreme Mortification to the Party, & I beleive the Secretary for foreign Affairs   handed it immediately to Congress, without consulting them; for I am perswaded if he had done it, the Result would have been, that Congress should never see that Copy. But they received it, & the only alternative was to invalidate it--It was therefore asserted that Mr. M____s never wrote it. He, who was soon made acquainted with it, I am informd, positively disowns it. But, say they, consider the Improbability of it--here is a Copy & Translation too, why is not a Copy of the Original furnish'd, This Letter must have come thro British Hands ; & it is a mere Piece of cunning of theirs to dec[e]ive and Prejudice our Ministers against a faithful Ally. But if it was not a Forgery--it is of little Consequence for Time has discover'd that the C. de V____s paid no Attention to it as he has not taken any one of the Measures pointed out in that Letter. However it was tho't best to beleive it a Forgery: & that Mr. J. was unreasonably Jealous. Many of the Party in Congress were undoubtedly very much disappointed in Mr. J____. He tho't & acted like a wise & an independant Man; & they did not wish him to think or act himself. It was not expected that he would take so decided a Part in favor of the Fishery, as it was said, that he once tho't it of no considerable Importance to the United States. It was therefore apprehended that you & Mr. L____s would unite in favor of them, & that the other two would not Care much about them. It was expected that this Division would frequently happen, until Mr. J____'s Letters discovered him to be a faithful & cautious Minister. A little Time before this, It was moved & debated, with as much warmth as any Question had for a long Time occasiond whether Mr. Laurens, as one of the Peace Commissioners should be suspended, until he should have informed Congress, whether he really addressd the Commons of G____ B____n in the shameful Stile of the Petition or Memorial, printed as his among the Debates of the House of Commons of G. B____n. (9) If it was really his, he had discovered so much Weakness, & so deeply wounded the Honor and Dignity of the United States, that he ought not on any Account to be continued in his important Trust. There was too much Truth in the Observation--But as the Members of the eastern States relied on him, to Join with you in supporting Our Claim and Right to the Fisheries, they could not consent to his Suspension, had it not been for this, he would certainly have been suspended--had they then known the decided Part Mr. J. would take--and that the other would have discovered a Degree of unexpected Flexibility in some Instances, he would have been suspended--But I conceive from very different Motives. I have no Doubt that the Aim of the Party was to weaken your Support--they only know what they meant, but this was my Opinion at the Time. It remains yet a Mistery, whether he was the real Author of that humiliating Peice, published as his.   It was concluded by some in Congress from a Passage or two in Mr. Laurens's Letter to them, after he first met you in Holland, that he was not well pleased with the Reception you gave him--or that you did not properly Estimate the Value of his Services, in not accepting of his Assistance in negociating a Loan.(10) I beleive some wish'd at that Time to make a Difference between you, if possible; & the systematical Junto were capable of framing here, & disseminating there, (& vice versa) what they pleas'd. If I remember rightly the Passages hinted at, were not of much Consequence, & did not seem to be dictated by Disappointment.  You will pardon me in candidly mentioning to you the Effects of your long Journal, forwarded after the signing of the provisional Treaty. It was read by the Secretary in Congress. It was too minute for the Delicacy of several of the Gentlemen. They appeared very much disposed to make it appear as ridiculous as possible;(11) several ungenerous Remarks were made upon it, as being unfit to be read in Congress, & not worth the Time expended in reading it. The Day after it was read, the Delegates of Masstts. found on the Table of Congress your Letter addressd to J. Jackson or the Delegates.(12) A Passage in that Letter led them to conclude that your Journal was not intended for Congress, as you mention that you had enclosed for his Perusal a Journal; and there was none enclosed. They therefore agreed to move that the Journal might be delivered to them. This Motion soon found Opponents. It was then said that it contained Matters of great Importance, which you had not mentioned in your other Letters, but we examined your other Letters, & found all the great Matters touch'd upon, & the smaller ones omitted. The Secretary for foreign Affairs, was sent for to know whether it came address'd to him; he produced three several Covers with your Seal, all directed to him, and the foldings corresponded to those of the Journal: after this, we let the Matter subside, as we found we should loose the Question; & also, that a Number of the Members were convinced, that there was some Mistake: nothing was said against it afterwards. Whatever your Intentions were respecting your Journal, it was necessary for us to take the Measure we did; and it had a very happy Effect.  By a Letter lately received from Mr. D____ it is probable he has left the C____t of St. P____ sometime since.(13) If my Memory would serve me at this distant Day, to relate the various ManOEuvres with Respect to him, it might serve to show how compleatly the System has operated here, as well as in Europe.  Mr. Dana's Character was fix'd as an Antigallican, from the first Letter he wrote to Congress from St. P____, after he had conferd with the french Minister at that Court. He wrote as an independent Man ought to. He gave his Sentiments freely upon the politicks of France.   This Mode of thinking, however well founded, was very unpalatable to Congress in general. At that Time he ought not to have committed his own Tho'ts to Paper--much less ought he to have wrote so freely against Gallican Measures without Cyphers. As Congress never received but One Copy which was either the Duplicate, or triplicate, the others must have fallen into Hands of our Ally, And consequently injure us extremely. The frequent Instances of her Generosity forbids every illiberal Sentiment. It indicates a little, contracted & Jealous Mind which would enter into the Minut of their Politicks, & take every Opportunity to make unfavourable Inferences from mere Appearances only. This seem'd to be the Light in which this Letter was viewed. It was necessary therefore to point out to Mr. D____ the Line of Conduct which he ought to pursue: to let him know that Congress would not listen to any Insinuations against our great & good Ally, and to damp that Ardor which he seem'd to discover, for displaying his Ministerial Commission.  A Lengthy Report was consequently made upon his Letter; the Work of John Morin Scott, in which Mr. D____'s Conduct was criticized upon unreasonably--and set in a very unfavourable point of Light. This Report could not obtain the Sanction of Congress; It was therefore referred to the Secretary for foreign Affairs, for a new Draught, which was not much less severe. It was agreed that both Draughts should be postponed, and a short Resolution was proposed, and adopted. I mention this Circumstance, because I am informed, that previous to the sending forward the Resolution, Mr. R. R. L____n forwarded one of those unauthentic Draughts; which, if true, was an unpardonable Piece of Cunning in him--for there was a Debate in Congress how those Drafts should be disposed of; & it was the Sense of Congress, that they should die. That Mr. L____n was capable of this, is but too evident, from many Specimens of his Disposition to Intrigue. Ever afterwards, the Systematical Junto, levelled their envenomed Shafts against him, Mr. D, & however important it might be to the united States, to have a Treaty with the Empress, they preferred the Sacrifice of that Advantage, rather than that Mr. D. should have the Honor of negociating that Treaty.(14) So strong has the Current been in favor of Gallican Politicks, that I am perswaded the Party here, were mortified at your Success with the united Netherlands, & were very content with the Ill Success of Mr. Jay as well as Mr. D. It was long since evident that Mr. J---- and Mr. Carmichael did not agree entirely. But before it had fully opened--there was an Attempt made in Congress, to transfer Mr. C____ to the Minister at Verseilles. The Motion set forth, that his Services were no longer necessary at the Court of Madrid, and that a Secretary was necessary to the Commission at Verseilles, that Mr. Carmichael be accordingly appointed to the said Commission, or to this Purport. It is not the Usage to make   such Appointments without a Nomination & Ballot. It was therefore objected to. The Question was divided, & agreed to, that Mr. C____'s Services were not necessary at the Court of Madrid. The Party who made the Motion were very much perplexed how to vote--for if they should agree to it & then not obtain the Transfer, they would defeat themselves. This really happened, near two years ago, & they have been very content to let Mr. C---- continue from that time to this.(15) The Marquis LaFayette has zealously interested himself in all our important Matters. He assumes the Language of a true born American, & is a very popular Character in the Country. But if I Mistake not he is deeply immersed in European Politicks, which are the worst that can possibly exist for America. When he last left this Country he went with an evident Design to assist our Commrs. in negociating the Peace. It was pretty plainly intimated that he wish'd to be one of the Number. Had he been added to them, it would not have been more extraordinary, than some other Matters that have taken Place. An Instruction however to you, to consult and advice with him, was carried.(16) I do not apprehend you were much the wiser for the Information you might have obtain'd from that Quarter. Few Americans are worthy to be trusted in some of the most important concerns of the United States--& not a single Foreigner. Doctor Franklin has long been urging Congress to make his Grandson a Minister; his last Letter presses them on this Subject & is accompanied with a particular Request purporting to be from the Minister of Sweden.(17) Nothing is to be feared from these Instances--for I am sure at present, that Congress will not make him a Minister; & I hope the Period never will arrive. It is said he has served an Apprenticeship; But with such a Master, & such Examples, he must be tenfold the worse for it.  The little Conversation I had with Mr. Thaxter led me to this narrative. I wish I had Time to arrange it better & not only so, but to examine our foreign Papers, from which, I doubt not that I could make many Extracts that would be worthy of communicating. You will I think be convinced that french Politicks have a great Ascendency among us. They have taken very deep Root. May Heaven finally extricate us from all foreign Intrigues.  ""

 John Francis Mercer to Benjamin Harrison  Sir Annapolis Decr. 10th. 1783.  It may be useful to state to yr. Excelly. the purport of a conversation I had with the Chevalier de la luzerne the day before I left Philadelphia, on the import of the term Free Ports as used in the Treaty of Commerce between the United States & the Crown of France(1)-- especially as I am induced to believe from a Letter which one of my Colleagues has receiv'd, that the Term & the Treaty are both much misunderstood within our State.  The substance of the Minister's explanation was that excepting the Free Ports which are agreed to be establish'd in Europe & the Islands, the United States have by that Treaty no Commercial advantages which other Nations (having Treaties of Amity & Commerce with France) do not also possess--all of whom are excluded from her W. India Islands.  That the advantages resulting from Free Ports were but inconsiderable--consisting only of some deductions from the duty of anchorage--an exemption from the imposition of Linguister--freedom from Taxes & some personal priveledges in favor of American Merchants residing within the limits of the Port. Thus far the description is applicable both to the Free Ports of Europe & those in the Islands, but then arises this material distinction--that the Americans are at liberty in Europe to sell & buy what they please & in the Indies they are prohibited from selling flour or purchasing Sugar or Coffee--or in other words they are not permitted to sell what they have, or purchase what they want. The Minister said he woud commit these things to Paper & all the other par[ti]culars which have come to him from his Court on the subject of Free Ports & then communicate 'em to me in a Letter--which when I receive, I will transmit to yr. Excellcy.(2) It is very true that  DECEMBER 10, 1783  he clos'd the conversation by saying, that his Court in consequence of memorials which he had transmitted on the subject, had it now in serious contemplation to yeild the United States more beneficial terms, & that at present, the fear that the U.S. wou'd become the Carriers of the produce of their Islands to Europe (to the great injury of the Marine power of France) was the only obstacle, to the free admission of our vessells into the West India Ports. They were in hopes of devising some happy expedient to present this & then to take of[f] the shackles already imposed on that Commerce. I hope it may prove so in event but I must fear, that no nation in Europe will grant us either advantages or reciprocity in Commerce but in proportion as they discover in these States such a concertion of Councils, as may exclude them (when necessary) from the benefits of our trade.  We are now informed that Mr. Hartley has of late been entrusted with Powers to negociate a Commercial Treaty--perhaps the reception which the Proclamation of the King of Great Britain met with in his Islands, may have enclin'd his Cabinet to think seriously of a more liberal conduct.  At present However we are effectually excluded from the West India Commerce--for there is no Treaty existing between the United States & any power, which gives Americans free admittance into West India Ports--& certainly if we wish to attain this object so essential to our prosperity or any advantages abroad, the foundation must be laid at home by conducting ourselves upon national or fOEderal principles. I have the honor to be with much respect, Yr. Excellcys Mo. Obt. hble. Sevt. John F. Mercer ""

We have some hopes of Rhodeisland coming in to-day, but when two more will be added seems as insusceptible of calculation as when the next earthquake will happen. We have at length received the Definitive treaty with a joint letter from all our Commissioners.(1) Not a tittle is changed in the treaty but the preamble & some small things which were of course. The Commissioners write that the riot of  DECEMBER 12, 1783  Philadelphia & departure of Congress thence made the most serious impressions in Europe, and have excited great doubts of the stability of our confederacy, and in what we shall end. The accounts were greatly exaggerated, & it is suspected that Gr. Br. wished to sign no treaty.  You have seen G. M. I hope & had much conversation with him.(2) What are his sentiment as to the amendment of our constitution? What amendments would he approve? Is he determined to sleep on, or will he rouze & be active? I wish to hear from you on this subject, & at all times on any others which occupy your thoughts. I see Bradford advertizes Smith's history of N. York.(3) As I mean to write for one for myself, and think I heard you say you had it not, I shall add one for you.

  Dear Sir Annapolis Dec. 16. 1783. I received your favor of the 8th inst.(1) with great satisfaction as it anticipated a proposition I want to make you of interchanging com-munications sometimes. The termination of the war will render what I can send you less interesting perhaps, while your intelligence will retain it's value. It is very essential to us to obtain information of facts,  DECEMBER 16, 1783  of opinions, and of wishes from our own country: with this view I have been writing by every post to my acquaintances in the General assembly but never yet have been able to provoke one scrip of a pen from any person of that honourable body.  On the day before yesterday we for the first time had seven states.(2) The Definitive treaty had been received by the President some time, and a joint letter from our Ministers.(3) This gave us an account of the various propositions and steps taken on both sides in the negociation which preceded the Definitive treaty. Mr. Hartley was the British negotiator with America. He was well disposed but his zeal for systems friendly to us constantly exceeded his powers to agree to them. Our ministers proposed a free intercourse between every part of the British dominions and the U.S. saving the rights of their chartered companies. Mr. H. approved of it, but his court declined assenting.(4) He then proposed that the unmanufactured produce of the U.S. should be admitted into G.B. and the manufactures of G.B. into the U.S. and that we should be allowed to carry our own produce to the W. Indies. On being questioned however he had no authority to conclude upon these articles even if agreable to us. News then arrived in France that our ports were thrown open to British vessels unconditionally. This stopped the negotations till he should communicate the intelligence to his court and receive their instructions. They immediately drew back; no further instructions were sent, till the other powers were ready to sign their definitive treaties when the British court ordered Hartley to sign the provisional articles as definitive. While they were expecting his instructions for the commercial treaty our Ministers went on with discussions for the definitive pacification. They proposed that we should be allowed to stay execution on judgments for British debts 3 years from the signature of the treaty, and that no interest should be demanded but from the time of the signature: that instead of recommending a restitution of confiscated property, a valuation of all destructions of property on both sides should be made and the balance only be paid by the party which had suffered least: that the Lakes, the Missisipi and St. Laurence with all the carrying places should be common to both. No answer could ever be obtained from the British court on any of these points. After signing definitively Hartley went to England expecting to return and settle the Commercial system; but they think it very incertain whether he will return. They press in the warmest terms the execution of the articles in favor of the tories. They say that the introduction of committees and town-meetings when we have a regular government established, the situation of the army, our reluctance to pay taxes, and the circumstances under which Congress left Philadelphia have reduced our new establishments much in the eyes of the European nations: that if England can be prevailed on to establish a liberal system of commerce, other nations will do so too; but probably not otherwise: that were it certain  DECEMBER 16,1783  we could be brought to act as one united nation she would make extensive concessions, but under present appearances she has no inducement to this as she is not afraid of retaliation: and conclude by observing that if in our commercial system we do not act collectedly 'we shall soon find ourselves in the situation in which all Europe wishes to see us, viz. as unimportant consumers of her manufactures and productions, and [as] useful labourers to furnish her with raw materials.' We have no certain prospect of nine states in Congress and cannot ratify the treaty with fewer. Yet the ratifications are to be exchanged by the 3d of March.  We have received a copy of the Dutch preliminaries. G.B. keeps Nagapatnam, and restores all other places taken. The Dutch are still to pay them the usual salute at sea.

I am particularly happy to hear by your brother, that you have almost recovered from the indisposition, with which you have been lately afflicted: an event I must consider fortunate to the state and your family, for I flatter myself, when perfectly restored, you will not withdraw yourself from the public service. It must be hoped that those measures, which have hitherto, will not always, prevail; as to establish in our public councils, a greater regard for public faith, and in private life, for morality, your exertions joined with those of some worthy men, must certainly be more successful. I am called on a theatre to which I am a perfect stranger.(1) There are before us some questions of the utmost consequence that can arise in the councils of any nation: the peace establishment; the regulation of our commerce, and the ar DECEMBER 16, 1783  rangement of our foreign appointments; whether we are to have regular or standing troops to protect our frontiers, or leave them unguarded; whether we will expose ourselves to the inconveniences, which may perhaps be the loss of the country westward, from the impossibility of preventing the adventurers from settling where they please: the intrusion of the settlers on the European powers, who border on us, a cause of discontent and perhaps of war, as with us a constant state of warfare with the savage tribes, to the ingrafting a principle in our constitution which may in its consequences, as it ever hath done with other powers, terminate in the loss of our liberty. How we are to counteract the narrow and illiberal system of commercial policy in the European powers, and what connexion we are to have with them, are also questions of the first import. If your health will permit, I shall be particularly happy to have your opinion upon these several subjects.(2) It is my desire to hear from you as frequently as possible, and upon those subjects before us, which I shall be happy to make known to you.

I am sorry to say that I see no immediate prospect of making up nine states, so careless are either the states or their delegates to their particular interests as well as the general good which would require that they be all constantly and fully represented in Congress.

Mr. Hartley on this informed them he could take no other steps till he  DECEMBER 206, 1783  should communicate this intelligence to his court and receive their instructions. He communicated it, and from that moment they were locked up in impenetrable reserve, and he unable to extort an answer of any kind from them. While expecting this answer, the ministers proceeded to exchange propositions for a definitive pacification. Ours proposed a three years suspension of executions on judgments for British debts, and that no interest should be allowed from the commencement of the war till the definitive signing: that accounts should be taken of all wanton waste of property on both sides and confiscations, and the balance be paid in money by the party suffering least: that the St. Laurence, the water boundary between us, and the Missisipi with the carrying places on whatever side, should be common to both. But it was now become impossible to get an answer of any sort from the court of London: and when the negotiations between the other belligerent powers were matured for signing, Mr. Hartley received orders to sign the preliminary articles as definitive, which was done. Mr. Hartley, who wished to establish a liberal system of commerce with us, then went to London hoping to return shortly and renew the commercial discussions. But our ministers think it doubtful whether he will return at all. I take the liberty of inclosing you an extract from their letter expressing their sentiments on some subjects of importance, supposing it will be neither unpleasant nor unprofitable to know how we are viewed on the general scale of nations.(3) I am sure it would be unnecessary even to hint to your Excellency that no part of this extract should be permitted to fall into the indiscreet hands of any printer. It seems possible that Great Britain may continue on the reserve till the present crisis in Europe shall have taken it's direction. The two Empires have formed an alliance defensive against all Christian powers, and offensive against the Turks. When announced by the Empress to the K. of Prussia he answered 'that he was very sensible upon this communication as one is on the communication of things of great importance,' thus avoiding a declaration and reserving himself at liberty to take any side or no side.(4) The Court of France took it up in a higher tone, and expressed her astonishment at the objects of the alliance. She immediately began the work of putting her army on the war establishment. Yet it is said there is a division in their councils. The present minister cannot retire from his declarations, which are for opposing the dangerous accession of power to Austria and Russia should they, as they propose, drive the Turks out of Europe and divide the territories they should abandon. The continuance or removal of the present minister is suggested as an index of the ultimate determination of France. If he goes out, they mean to be pacific; and to be active if he is retained. Yet it is doubted whether France can venture into the war without the aid of Prussia. Great Britain it is suspected will lie dormant to avail herself of the distresses of her neighbor. Happy for us that we have got into port just as this storm is rising. Propositions  DECEMBER 17, 1783  for treaties of commerce have come to Dr. Franklin from several European courts, and others are ready to treat. Denmark, Portugal, Sardinia, the Emperor of Morocco have made overtures. The last is so well disposed that he has issued orders to his armed vessels to molest no American, and has sent a person to Paris to attend any person delegated from us to his court. Great Britain will send no minister to America till she receives one from thence. The Emperor of Germany cannot from the custom of his court. Our Minister Mr. Dana is on the return from Petersburg: nothing being done there, tho' probably their dispositions were become favourable at the time it was thought necessary by his recall to shew we should no longer be supplicants any where. It is to be noted that the observation of our ministers in the inclosed extract 'that the present aspect of our affairs has somewhat abated the ardor of the European nations to form connections with us' is posterior in time to the state given above. I recollect nothing important enough to be added to this sketch of our affairs in Europe and of those of Europe itself.  The former method of correspondence by joint letters from the delegates to the Executive has been liable to some difficulties. The same object does not always make the same impression on different eyes. Of consequence it might happen that by pursuing the method of joint representation, much must be kept back because all had not formed the same ideas of it. Being sensible that frequent and full communications are for the public good, we have agreed to adopt the following plan of official correspondency with your Excellency if it shall meet with your approbation. Resolutions of Congress and other solemn things which call for authentic notification we will communicate jointly. But all other matters which admit differences of opinion we propose shall be communicated weekly by some one gentleman of the delegation, having previously shewn his letter to his collegues. If they think he has omitted any thing or represented it differently from their own view of it, they reserve a private and separate right of writing to your Excellency their separate sentiments. In this way we think you will receive fuller informations and that you may judge for yourself where you find a difference of opinion. The duty of correspondence is made mine for the present month, and will be taken up by my collegues successively in the order of their nomination, each exercising it a month.(5) I have the honour to be with sentiments of the most profound esteem & respect Your Excellency's Most obedient & most humble servt. Th. Jefferson ""

  Dear Sir,(1) Annapolis 18th Sept. [i.e., Dec.] 1783.(2) Your favor of Nov. 8th came duly to hand & I have no apology for having delayed an answer to the present time but my removal here & the want of something of consequence to write about.  I arrived in this City on Friday evening the 12th Instant. I should have come forward sooner but for two reasons; one was that there was no prospect of having an House here sooner--as the event confirmed--And secondly I waited for the return of Mr. Stelle to Philadelphia in hopes that he would bring with him the last grant of Assembly to me. As I was in great want of money having spent all I had received of the State & run largely in debt. You may imagine better than I can express, how I was disappointed & mortified when on the arrival of Mr. Stelle he did not even bring me a single Letter.  DECEMBER 18, 1783  The representatives of the Sovereignty of R.I. & P.P. were obliged to supplicate the Assistance of Messieurs Hewes & Anthony to relieve their distresses & to furnish them with money to proceed forward to Annapolis. We hope the bills we were obliged to draw on Governor Bowen in favor of those Gentlemen who obliged us in our time of need, have been duly honored.  In this polite city we are well accommodated with Lodgings, &ca but I assure you that a great deal of money will carry you but a little ways here. Butter, cheese, Cyder, Apples, Onions & Potatoes are dear & much wanted here. Would it not answer to send us a small vessel load of such kinds of produce & load with flour at Baltimore?  The definitive Treaty is arrived as you conjectured: & we only wait for 9 States to convene in order to ratify it. It is in the terms of the provisional articles. There is no prospect of a treaty of commerce with G. Britain soon. You wish to know what Congress intend to do in regard to the return of the Refugees, &c. I can inform you that a report lies on our Table for making the recommendations stipulated in their favor in the provisional articles as well as for ratifying every part of them in the definitive Treaty. It will then rest with the particular States to conform implicitly to all the express & absolute stipulations thereof; & to use their own discretion as to the recommendations.  After the definitive Treaty shall have been ratified by Congress & transmitted to the States the Judicial Courts will have to explain & to interpret its various parts as cases arise. It is allowed, even by our ministers who negotiated the peace, that some articles are obscurely & doubtfully expressed. They obtained all they could. Ambiguities & circumlocutions are not adopted on such occasions for want of abilities so much a[s] for want of agreement. You wish to know what is doing for the public creditors? You know what has been done in regard the Western territory. The answer of Virginia has not been sent us. His Excellency G.W. told me that he estimatd the Country ceded by N.York & Virginia at five hundred thousand square miles--equal to three hundred & twenty millions of acres, which at one eighth of a Dollar per acre would extinguish a debt of forty millions of Dollars. It is a general opinion they will & ought to fetch a Dollar per acre. Altho the Western territory may not be a fund immediately productive--as it will require time to discuss & arrange many things before a Congressional Land-Office can be opened; yet I consider that Country, under a wise management a sufficient & solid security for the final payment of the public debts. For that purpose it is formally mortgaged in the very terms of our acceptance of the Virginia cession. It is to be lamented that more present relief cannot be extended to the indigent & distressed classes of the public creditors. This I have good reason to believe is systematically opposed by the sanguine advocates for a Continental Impost. Their maxim is \""the   worse, the better.\"" To what a despera[te...] our affairs may be worked up--and how [many?] more mouths are to be opend in favor of 5 [...] by such an universal obstruction of p[...] where, in many cases it might be done, [ti]me only can discover. To use the phrase of the gentlemen of the turf, I look on the contest betwixt us & the Continentalists to be now purely a trial of our wind--on the ground of argument they have confessedly no advantage.  By the enclosed copy of a certificate you will see what Maryland has been doing in favor of the Holders of L.O. certificates.(3) I am told large Sums have been taken into their treasury. Would it not be better for us to adopt a similar mode--and to put on a heavier impost, with an excise on the back of it, to pay the intrest, which should annually arise to our own citizens, & trust the Union for compensation, than to think of giving Congress a revenue, to be at their disposal?  With sincere esteeme, I am, &c. D. Howell  ""

  Sir, Annapolis 18th December 1783. I wrote your Excellency, in great haste, a Letter by last Post,(1) requesting the favor of you to hurry Colo. Bedford down. I now, at more leisure, take the liberty of troubling you again. There has been very little business done in Congress since they met here. The time has been chiefly spent in reading dispatches, Memorials &ca. There have been many Letters received from our Ministers abroad, particularly Mr. Adams,(2) who appears to be a Man of great industry, and desirous of promoting the welfare of his Country. He mentions a conversation which he had with the Prince Stadtholder who finds fault with Congress for not sending ambassadors rather than Ministers to the Courts of Europe, and thinks we ought to assert our right, lest hereafter it may be disputed. He also communicates the substance of a conversation between him and the Sardinian Minister, who is of opinion that it would be respectful, and have a good effect, if  DECEMBER 18, 1783  Congress were to send Circular Letters to all the Powers of Europe, informing them of our independence. That such Letters would have favorable answers. Mr. Adams is of opinion that a connexion with Germany would have a tendency to make us appear more respectable in the eyes of the other powers; but above all recommends that our Citizens should be inspired with proper ideas of their own importance and independence. He informs us that a Treaty between the Emperor of Germany and the Empress of Russia, offensive against the Porte, and defensive against all Christian Powers, had been concluded. That this embarrasses the French Ministry, as it was a very serious question whether or not they should involve themselves in a war with two Christian Powers in behalf of the Turks. The Emperor & Empress sent a Courier to inform the King of Prussia of their Treaty. His answer was, that he received the information with that sensibility which matters of such high importance meritted.  Dr. Franklin mentions that Mr. Montgomery, of Alicant, had entered into a Negotiation with the Emperor of Morocco. That the Emperor was inclined to Treat with us, and that a Person was then in Spain on his way to Paris for that purpose. That in the meantime the Emperor had given orders to his Cruizers not to molest our ships on the open sea. That Portugal, as well as the other Powers, hesitated about Treating, and assigns as a reason the unsettled state of our Government, of which the removal of Congress from Philadelphia afforded an instance. The Pope's Nuncio had sent him a note, of which he inclosed a copy, mentioning Civitta Vecchia, and another Port where we might carry on a beneficial Trade; and requesting leave of Congress, for his Holiness the Pope to send over an Ecclesiastical officer by the name of a Bishop or Præfect, tho' the former would be preferred, in order that the People of the Catholic Faith, residing here, might have the benefit of Orders and Confirmation without going to a foreign State.(3) That formerly they depended on such an officer residing in London; but the seperation of the two Countries seemed to make a new arrangement necessary. He also inclosed a copy of a Letter which he received from the Grand Master of the order of St. John of Jerusalem (to whom he had sent one of his Medals) expressing great affection for the United States of America, and the pleasure it would give him to see the ships of this Country at the island of Malta.  Mr. Laurens, at London, forwarded Bridgen's and Walter's second proposition for furnishing the United States with Copper Coin at 14/8d per lb.(4)  Mr. Dana, at Petersburg, communicated an Account of the Treaty of Germany & Russia, and mentioned his opinion that France & Prussia were interested in preventing the aggrandizement of the House of Austria--acknowledged the Receipt of his Letters of recall, and was of opinion that an advantageous Treaty with Russia might now be made.   He sent a List of the Empress's Army and a List of dutiable Merchandize imported into and exported from that Empire.  Mr. Dumas, charge des affaires, at the Hague, is of opinion that the British Ministry are endeavouring to detach the Dutch from the French Interest. I am with great esteem and Regard, Sir, your Excellency's most obt. and very humble Servt. E. McComb ""

  Dr. Sir, Annapolis Decr. 19th 1783  When I arrived here, last Fri evening Mr. Gerry deliver'd me the inclosed letters in the State you see them.(1) In the course of their travels, like other travellers, they it seems met with some external rubs; but their internals are I trust safe & sound. After tarrying many days for the unum necessarium at Philadelphia, we at last sat out from thence, in a Stage-waggon, last Monday sennight. Just as Mr. Howell enter'd (Mr. Foster and I were in the house) the horses started off on the full run; the driver who had not collected the reins & who was thrown across the pole, could not in the least command them, and the passengers were in the utmost dangers of being, with the waggon, dashed to pieces. Mr. Howell and another gentleman jumped out while the horses were on full speed, without receiving any material  DECEMBER 19, 1783  hurt. A gentleman & lady continued in. Very happily, the horses brought up against a house without their or the waggon suffering any apparent damage.  After the driver had bathed his bruised limbs, we sat off in pretty good spirits; but had not passed the Schuylkill a mile before the waggon broke. We were obliged to tarry where we were two hours for another waggon. Besides these we met with no disaster, altho' from the badness of the roads, and some of our horses we were in frequent danger of being overset; and per varios cases arrived at Baltimore Tuesday evening. For want of a conveyance we were obliged to tarry there until the Friday morning following, and arrived here as before mentioned. There are only seven States present; so that we cannot ratify the definitive treaty, the ratification of which is to be exchanged in March; nor do any other business of consequence. Jersey, New-York, your State,(2) New Hampshire, Georgia and So. Carolina are unrepresented. We expect that the last will be represented very soon, and from the information I recd. from Mr. Brown, the express-rider, at Philadelphia I have reason to think that your state will not be long unrepresented. If your delegates should not have set out when you receive this urge them on. If the States were represented, and in earnest, I think we could dispatch all the business of importance in the course of three months, and adjourn leaving small matters to a Committee of the States. By letters from our foreign ministers it appears,(3) that affairs between the two imperial Courts, and the Turks were not decided; that Russia was not satisfied with the beneficial commercial offers that had been made by the Turks, but seemed to be bent upon destroying the Ottoman empire; That the Emperor of Morocco had given orders to the commanders of his ships of war not to molest the vessels of the United States; that proposals had been made by the Pope through his Nuncio to our Ministers to enter a commercial treaty with us; and that the Pope was desirous that we might admit a Rom. Cath. Vicar or Bishop into the U.S.; that the trade of the neutral powers had increased during the war, and that they were disposed to enter into commercial treaties with the U.S.; that the Danes had made St. Thomas & St. Johns, but not Santa Cruz, free ports; that Mr. Hartley who had gone to London, was expected back at Paris in a short time; and that he had powers to negotiate a treaty of commerce with us. Mr. Adams says that all matters of commerce must be discussed in London; Mr. Dana it seems by his last letter dated July 16--in consequence of a letter he had recd. from the late Secry. for foreign affairs intended to leave St. Petersburgh for America in 3 week.(4) As I have not heard of his arrival I conclude he had recd. some subsequent resolution of Cong. which had stopped him. Thus, Sir, I have in a literally round about matter, and in great haste given you such news as I could   recollect. If it and the remission of the letters directed to you should give you any satisfaction you are kindly welcome. Present my regards to your wife and children, to Judge Huntington, his wife and, I wish I could add, their children, and let Squire B-n know that I am his friend & servant. W. Ellery ""

  My dear sir, Annapolis 20th Decr. 1783, Saturday  I am happy to find by your Letter of the 2d, that You had the Pleasure of meeting your Family in Health, & was in the perfect Enjoyment of domestic Felicity: this I hope will be my Case, as soon as I can be disengaged from the perplexing Scenes of a political Life--but you will say this is one of Smiths Facts, that will never happen.  Your Information respecting the Governor is curious, & there is not the least probability in my Mind, that he is sincere in his Declaration. I cannot account for the ManOEuvre on any other principles, than that his Excellency has experienced less Flattery of late, than was formerly paid him, & the Love of this, being his master passion, he is determined to recover the Loss by intimating an Intention to give up the Reins, & leave an ungrateful people to their own Destruction.(1) Such a proposition must naturally produce in the Minds of his Constituents, a Conviction of their Error; & an increased Exertion to do Justice to his Merits, & to regain his Favour, without which, what will become of the unfortunate CommonWealth of Massachusetts? The Suppression of our Letters must make us appear in a singular Light, if not explained to the Legislature. I have communicated the Matter to the Speaker, & think he will attend to it.(2) You have referred me to your former opinion respecting the fOEderal Towns, but not recollecting it I wish You would refresh my Memory, & inform me how the Measure is generally received.  I have complied with your Request respecting Mr Ellery & others & am obliged to you for your Information respecting my Friends.  The General is in Town, & dined this Day at the presidents House in Company with Congress, the Governor, a Number of general officers, & other Gentlemen. On Monday he is invited to a publick Entertainment by Congress, & to another by the State. On Tuesday, when he is to have an Audience of Congress & resign his Commission. Thus will he retire to private Life a finished Character, for it may be justly said of him, he is a great, & a good Man. It appears by Letters from Europe that the poor Turks are doomed to Destruction. The Empress of Russia & Emperor of Germany have announced to his Prussian Majesty their Alliance offensive against the porte, & defensive against all the christian powers. His Majesty's answer is curious. \""I am (says he) sensible on this Communication as I am on all Communications of great Importance.\""(3) DECEMBER 20, 1783  Thus does this great politician & Warrior, render it impossible for the belligerent powers to penetrate his Intentions, which undoubtedly are, to conduct according to Circumstances. The object of the Empires, probably is to drive the Turks from Europe: if the King of Prussia is admitted to share in the Division of the Turkish Territory, he will have an Inducement to be neuter; if not, there is Reason to suppose, he will join France in Support of the Turks, & produce a War that will be truly memorable. Mr Dana informs Congress, that he proposes to return without accomplishing his Mission. The Empress was to have received him, on the signing of the definitive Treaty between the united States & G Britain, but he received an order of Congress of May last which induced him to form the Resolution mentioned.(4) The definitive Treaty was signed without the Mediation of the Emperor & Empress, I mean the Treaty between America & Britan; as the latter made objections. My Compliments to Mrs Holten & be assured I am Sir your sincere Friend & hum Servt, E Gerry  [P.S.] The Mail was found--out of three Letters which I had franked, two were opened--all the others were recovered (even those that inclosed bank Notes), excepting Some from other eastern Members.

  [December 21? 1783 (1) I send you the sketch, which I have been obliged to obliterate and blot after making what I intended for a fair copy. You will observe my plan was to make a short review in very general terms of those actions which redound to the General's particular credit, viz. the discouraging circumstances under which he accepted the command--his steadiness and perservance when obliged to retire across the Delaware and our affairs then at their lowest point of depression--his revival of our hopes by recrossing the Delaware--and finally the capture of Cornwallis which undoubtedly made the peace. I have noted these events in the margin opposite to the passages alluding to them, and have drawn lines under other expressions taken from the General's address.

  Annapolis, 21 Decr. [1783] To-morrow carries me from this place (1)--but the day recalls to my mind a promise I made to my [friend] some weeks ago of an entertainment at the governors. When I got hither from Baltimore which was on Wednesday about noon (2) I found every body preparing to go with the rest. It exhibited a strange mixture of men and characters. The lords of the old government, with some of the sovereigns and citizens of the new (if we may calculate on finding them together) seemed to have forgotten all former ideas of precedence and distinction. Sir Robert Eden would have persuaded one by being of the party, that he had lost all remembrance of his having been the owner of the house in which he danced, and late governor of Maryland (3)-- but the thing could not be, where every person he met, and every picture and piece of furniture he saw, served to remind him of the past, or brought up the recollection of pleasures he could no longer repeat. This state has taken away his property, and a libertine life his constitution. He finds himself a dependent on persons he despised, and insignificant on the spot where, but lately he was every thing. He sees his old parasites and companions enjoying places under the  DECEMBER 21 1783  present government, and devoted to new interests. He is without a train of followers obedient to his pleasing will. He perceives, that even the hearts he is said to have subdued by his entertainments or warmed by his gallantries have altered by time or submitted to other seducers. If we look for the cause of his return to this place in his pride--that would not suffer him to sue for favors, from men he so lately considered as rebels. If in his interest, he will be blamed for meanness. If in his poverty, he is certainly to be pitied. So situated and circumstanced I could neither believe him happy or at his ease, unless I had supposed, that, with his estate and constitution he had lost his sensibility.  Mr. Harford is a young man, and excites more favorable ideas.(4) He has no prejudices to encounter because this is his first visit to America. The natural son of the late lord Baltimore and heir to his estate which we have taken away, He is handsome, sensible and of polite manners, and withal seems to be governed by a discretion beyond his years. All this speaks in his behalf, and disposes one to wish, that amongst the virtues of the country we could reckon magnanimity.  Sir Robert danced with Mrs. Plater. Mr. Smith, his secretary, with her daughter. Mr. Clapham formerly receiver of rents, was at the card tables. Mr. Harford did not dance, but was seen sometimes chatting with the ladies and sometimes with himself.  Such a blended assembly--men of so opposite principles and manners--those who had lost estates and those who had them--those who were once the greatest, and who were now among the least--those who were once nothing, and who are now every thing--ladies who shone under the late constitution, and some few of both sexes, whose value and merits no revolutions could diminish--all conspired to excite reflections and to afford amusement. The scene did not cease to be interesting till near twelve o'clock--when I retired to my apartment--took out a little amulet from my bosom--kissed it twice and went to sleep.  But know my charmer, that the dear image the amulet presented did not leave me, but continued almost throughout the night to give birth to the tenderest and most agreeable dreams. This being the last engagement I had to discharge in Annapolis I hasten to join my amiable friend and interchange those solemn vows which are to make us one throughout time and eternity.

  [December 23, 1783] (1) Had I been obliged to count the sands as they fall from an hour glass, since last Friday, I could not have done it with more exactness than I have counted the minutes of each day. It is, my dear Peggy, impossible for me to tell or you to feel the solicitudes and suspenses I have experienced. I am now become reasonable and do not think you are sick: but this does not relieve me. I do not think you have neglected me; but this does not place me at rest. I suppose that some sufficient cause must have intervened to prevent me getting your letter, as clouds intervene and prevent the sight of the sun. But I will say no more on this subject, for I do not wish to communicate any distress this incident has caused me to my affectionate Peggy.  To day my love the General at a public audience made a deposit of his commission and in a very pathetic manner took leave of Congress. It was a solemn and affecting spectacle; such an one as history does not present. The spectators all wept, and there was hardly a member of Congress who did not drop tears. The General's hand which held the address shook as he read it. When he spoke of the officers who had composed his family, and recommended those who had continued in it to the present moment to the favorable notice of Congress he was obliged to support the paper with both hands. But when he commended the interests of his dearest country to almighty God, and those who had the superintendence of them to his holy keeping, his voice faultered and sunk, and the whole house felt his agitations. After the pause which was necessary for him to recover himself, he proceeded to say in the most penetrating manner, 'Having now finished the work assigned me I retire from the great theatre of action, and bidding an affectionate farewell to this august body under whose orders I have so long acted I here offer my commission and take my leave of all the employments of public life.' So saying he drew out from his bosom his commission and delivered it up to the president of Congress. He then returned to his station, when the president read the reply that had been prepared--but I thought without any shew of feeling, tho' with much dignity.  This is only a sketch of the scene. But, were I to write you a long letter I could not convey to you the whole. So many circumstances  DECEMBER 23, 1783  crowded into view and gave rise to so many affecting emotions. The events of the revolution just accomplished--the new situation into which it had thrown the affairs of the world--the great man who had borne so conspicuous a figure in it, in the act of relinquishing all public employments to return to private life--the past--the present--the future--the manner--the occasion--all conspired to render it a spectacle inexpressibly solemn and affecting.

  Dear Comr Annapolis 24th Decr. [17]83. I have only a Moment to inform You that I have received your Favour of the 8th with the Inclosures, & am obliged to you for your punctuality in those Matters--they require no answer. Give me leave confidentially to inform You, that on my Journey from Philadelphia to this City, I saw an Annapolis paper in which a Master of a Vessel, who sailed to Nova Scotia in a Vessel belonging to Colonel Johonnot, and a Frenchman named Brutie, (who is said to be the Son of the Merchant that entrusted Colo Johonnot in France & shut him up at Baltimore) declares, that he (the Master of the Schooner) sailed with Colo Johonnot & Brutie on board for Nova Scotia; that they proposed on the passage to cruise as pirates; that he rejected the proposal; that when they arrived at some port in Nova Scotia, he was dismissed from the Vessel, & she sailed with Colo Johonnot & Brutie, & the rest of the Crew, on board, to cruise as pirates. These are the Circumstances in the publication as recollected by me, but as I read the paper only once, I am not certain of all the Facts. If I can obtain the paper, I will inclose it, & request you to make this  DECEMBER 24, 1783  Communication to Mr Story confidentially, that if the Captain's Declaration is without Foundation, Colo Johonnot's Friends may do what is proper on the occasion. A merry Christmas to You all & be assured I am yours, Dear Comr, E. G. [P.S.] The Mackrel are not wanted. The Meat that is to be sent, if an Oppertunity offers soon--1 quintal.(1) ""

  Dear Sir, Annapolis Dec. 24, 1783. Your favor of the 18th Ult. came duly to hand & is before me. Amidst the almost total silence of my friends your Letter was peculiarly grateful--on account of the friendly manner in which it was written & the useful information it contained. Mr. Ellery joins me in returning his compliments & acknowledging your goodness in procuring suitable grants of money for us at Little rest--And for your obliging offer to forward it to us. I presume before this will reach you, our joint Letter dated at Philadelphia1 will have given you information of our having been under the necessity of drawing on you in favor of Messieurs Hewes & Anthony. We doubt not of ready payment on our bills, as the credit of the State as well as our personal honor is concerned. It gives me great pain to be so frequently under the necessity of apologizing for the Conduct of Congress in regard to consolidating L.O. certificates--and in regard to issuing certificates for one year's interest.(2) As I had those measures greatly at heart I have omitted no opportunity to press them. They are systematically opposed. They require the concurrence of nine States & we seldom had nine States on the floor last Summer, exclusive of Pennsylvania; and since our arrival at this place we have had but seven. DECEMBER 24, 1783  A second Letter of remonstrance to the delinquent States on this head was ordered yesterday.(3) A full representation would enable us to close the most material public business in two or three months, & have a recess. This I had proposed & written to some of my friends before I heard that it was the wish of the State. It would lessen the public expence--shew the people that Congress do not intend to become a permanent body--And Delegates would attend more punctually at such short terms & the public business would be done with more dispatch. You must have heard that N. Hampshire has ordered their citizens to receive certificates for one years intrest due on L.O. certificates, which are to be taken in payment of the tax on the requisition of Sept. 4, 1782.(4) The power of the particular States to take such a measure without further order from Congress is not contested even by those who oppose the measure. I have wished that Congress would point out the mode--but the opposition against making any further advances in that way and the delay unavoidable in the case will perhaps justify, as you observe--\""The States interfering in the business.\"" It is cruelty in the extreme thus to delay doing justice, where it is practicable, in order to work up & thicken the Storm. I am sorry that we do not better coincide in opinion on the Subject of fOEderal Towns. I shall reserve a more full discussion of this point to a personal interview, & only submit to you for the present, whether it was not better to adopt the measures we did than to have returned to Philadelphia--in which case, in all human probability, that would have been the place of our permanent residence? Nothing but drawn Bayonetts ever did drive Congress out of Philadelphia and there appeared to me no sufficient reason to believe that any thing else ever would. A plan is now laid, if honestly pursued, to keep them out of any large city forever--And if that point is carried, it is of little consequence in my view where they sit, or whether they have any fOEderal Town--provided they have suitable accommodations. A perambulatory Congress favors republicanism--a permanent one tends to invetorate power--Aristocracy--and Monarchy.  I was greatly alarmed on hearing that Massachusetts had adopted the Impost.(5) I cannot yet learn what those saving clauses are. I perfectly agree with you that funds must be provided--but as you rightly observe in a constitutional way. I consider the Western Country as an important fund & hope that it will prove, in addition to State Imposts, State excises, & common taxation, a sufficient fund to secure the final payment of the national debt. At 1/8 Dollar per Acre it would extinguish a Debt of forty millions of Dollars. I hear of little being said or done about a Continental Impost to the Southward; I fear that Virginia will finally adopt it.(6) She is now in a good   humor with Congress on account of our vote for a second fOEderal Town on her Confines & accepting her cession on terms so advantageous to her. You very justly reprobate the dilatory & ineffectual mode of settling the public accounts. The Genl. Assembly of Pennsylvania has remonstrated to Congress on this Subject, and reprehend some of the Instructions given to the commissioners--particularly that which directs them to reexamine all certificates issued by our Quarter Masters, Commissaries, &c. They say in fine that it is their expectation that the Commissioners be governed by resolves of Congress & not by directions from the Office of Finance. This has been referred to Mr. M. & he has returned us a long report justificative of his Conduct & explanatory of the whole business according to his views of it.(7) Here again we cannot take a single step for want of nine States. In this affair the public suffers extremely--but it is said to be of no consequence 'till funds are provided, &c. You wish to hear that Congress at their new place of residence are \""devested of all party & local attachments.\"" I am happy to give you such information. In what little business has been done hear I have not been able to discover the least tincture of poisonous influence. The Members appear to aim at the public good without regarding the dictates of any of their Servants; and I have the pleasure [to] inform you that we have some very amiable characters here at present. It is said that Mr. M. proposes to pay us a visit of some length. He will perhaps Give his friends previous notice of his time & get a full House of them to urge on his old System & which he may honestly pursue yet; for I have no Idea that he proposes to relinquish either his system, or his office untill his intrest & that of his friends in the public debt shall be secured by Funds in the Hands of Congress. I wrote you my mind on this head in my last. You observe that you are full of goods & more coming. I should think the plenty would reduce the price; & that it must be our intrest to have foreign goods cheap in our Markets--And our goods dear in theirs. The prices of our products, I should think would be naturally raised by a competition of purchasers from all nations. The fear expressed by some people that foreigners will take our trade into their hands & be our carriers as well as our Merchants appears to my weak apprehension very ill founded. Nature protests against such violence. The British & other European nations will soon find the bad policy as well as the impracticability of carrying their arbitrary orders into effect & of continuing them so much against the natural course of things. We have a natural right to carry our own trade--and a natural right will create in the event, an intrest in our favor, which will secure to us the exercise of this right. The W.I. Planters are already clamorous. All Europe will at length find their intrest in the freedom of our trade, as they do in our Independence. DECEMBER 24, 1784  I confess it was an unpardonable omission in my last Letter not to have informed you of what we had done about the State's accounts in Philadelphia; but as we did not neglect to do the business, I hope no injury will accrue to the State. Mr. Milligan, the Comptroller General of the Treasury, in whose keeping the accounts are, promissed to write to Mr. Chinn on the Subject & concert the measures necessary to be taken thereon & to see that they were carried into effect at the public charge. Whereupon we left the business in his hands--confiding that the intrest of the State will not suffer in any event. You hope \""removing to the South will not make me forget my old friends to the north.\"" The hint, Sir, is very natural & it gives me no small degree of pleasure to find that you have a desire to retain an intrest in my friendship. You have, Sir, as the poet says \""charissima pignora mei\"" \""the dearest pledges of myself\"" in Providence.(8) My dearest Love--and five sweet prattling babes you have my whole earthly intrest--And in your estimation of me rests all my expectations in life. Be assured, Sir, my obligations to my friends in Providence--to the Town & to the State are too deeply graved in a faithful breast to be erased by time or distance. Sorry I am to have the least occasion to call in question the sincerity of any of my friends regard for me. I will not call it in question. I will rather conclude that they consider me in their pay; and that it is my duty to carry on both sides of the correspondence. Mr. Ellery thinks I have written as much as six Quires of paper. And I have not recd above a quarter of a Quire--excepting Mrs Howells Letters. We left Philadelphia on the 8th Instant, having stayed for the arrival of Mr. Stelle, & came thro' Baltimore where we attended divine service on the Continental Thanksgiving day and arrived here on the 12th. There had been no Congress, as we expected, before our arrival. Mr. Ellery & myself have taken lodgings at a Mr. Millards near the State House. We are well accommodated with large & elegant apartments & sufficient fare--but our living will, on the whole, come dearer here than in Philadelphia. The City stands on rising ground & looks into the Bay by a most beautiful prospect. The Severn runs by it on the North West & another river or creek on the other side--so that we appear to be almost surrounded by water. The Soil is Sandy--and the walking good (tho the Streets are not paved) at all Seasons. The Shores are steep & the banks Sand & gravel. There are no morasses, salt-meadows--or stagnant waters. I should estimate the Houses from 4 to 500--the Inhabitants, perhaps as many thousand. The State House & the House assigned for the President are spacious & eligantly finished, far exceeding those buildings in Philadelphia--Houses in general in the city are very large & look like palaces, compared with the huts of the peasants in the Country you pass through. This City is the Residence of wealthy land holders from an extensive circle. This is their   winter quarters & the Theatre of their diversions. The bon ton of this City affect an higher Sense of honor, and a more refined politess than any other part of the State. I am told here is a play house, a ball-room & many good taverns, but there is no place of public worship. On the 19th Instant the Commander in Chief arrived in this City. On the 20th he informed Congress by Letter of his intention to resign his Commission. A public Audience for him was ordered on the 23d at which he solemnly delivered his Commission to the President of Congress after a short address--which was answered by the President; both of which you will see in the public papers. An elegant public dinner was ordered on the 22d by Congress. The Governor, Senate & House of Delegates with sundry of the citizens in all, including Congress, about 200 attended & partook of the feast--after which 13 toasts were drank under a discharge of 13 Cannon. Governor Paca invited the Company to a Ball in the Evening at the State House. The farewell of General Washington was a most solemn Scene--this closed the public audience on the 23d. The State House was crowded with people of the first fashion who all partook in the occasion. And many testified their affectionate attachment to our illustrious Hero & their gratitude for his Services to his Country by a most copious shedding of tears. After this Scene closed he set off for his Seat on the Potowmac having purposed to reach there in Season to spend Christmas at his own House. I have enclosed you a list of the Toasts drank at the public dinner. I have also enclosed you a copy of a certificate issued by this State to its citizens, holders of L.O. certificates, in lieu thereof. It is said that many have been thus taken up--the State assuming the debt of Congress.(9) As there is no public worship in this place & Congress has at present no Chaplain,(10) I have been witness to no act of public devotion since I have been here. The second night after my arrival being Saturday night, in the Edge of the evening the Servant brought into the room & set on the Table two candles & two packs of Cards. Some of the company soon spread around the Table & went to playing for money. I left the room & was shewed to another. After which I sent for Mr Ellery & we spent the Evening by ourselves. In conversation I observed to the Company that in N. England the Table would have been furnished with a bible & Psalm book instead of two packs of Cards. I was told the next day that they had played for ten to twenty guineas a game--and that one man had lost 200 guineas. Gentlemen here boast of such adventures. So widely different are the customs & manners of the people here from those of N. England. The older I grow the more I am impressed with the persuasion that religion is for the good of Society. If in this World only it had a re-  ward, that reward would be sufficient to induce a reasonable man to become seriously religious: and the advantages Government would receive from the prevalence of some religion among the people are sufficient, in my opinion to induce every patriot, or good politician to countenance & encourage it by precept & example. I therefore cordially join you in wishing that we may \""build our future empire on the basis of religion, virtue & justice.\"" Sundry letters from our ministers in Europe have been recd. with & since the definitive Treaty. They contain nothing of moment. I shall however take extracts from some of them to lay before the next Session of our Assembly. With the most perfect consideration I have the honor to be, Dr Sir your most obedient & hble Servt. David Howell. P.S. Please to Let my friend Dr. Arnold read this Letter, if at home, & such others as you may think proper. ""

  Sir Annapolis Dec. 24. 1783. The present week affords us nothing new for communication unless it be the affecting scene of yesterday. Genl. Washington then had his last audience of Congress, laid down his commission and bid a final adieu to them and to all public life. His address on the occasion was worthy of him. This you will see in the public papers. I cannot help expressing my extreme anxiety at our present critical situation. The departure of a member two days hence leaves us with only six states and of course stops all business. We have no certain propect of nine within any given time; chance may bring them in, and chance may keep them back. In the mean time only a little over two months remain for their assembling, ratifying and getting the ratification across the Atlantic to Paris.(1) All that can be said is that it is yet possible. It is well known that Great Britain wished to postpone the conclusion of the  DECEMBER 24, 1783  treaty. Her reasons we know not. But she certainly knew that a great continental war was kindling, and that France our principal support would be probably deeply engaged in it. It is not impossible then but she might hope for some favourable opportunity of changing the face of the treaty. If the ratifications are not offered by the day she will have too much ground for objection to the validity of the treaty, and to ratify or not as she pleases. As every circumstance of distress will render her the easier on this point, we are pleased with the intelligence of the day which is that she has actually landed twenty one regiments in Ireland. It comes by a ship from London to Baltimore, and from thence here. But Baltimore has not been famed for the truth of it's intelligence. I have the honour to be with sentiments of the highest esteem and respect Your Excellency's Most obedient & most humble servt., Th. Jefferson (2) ""

  Sir, Annapolis December 24th. 1783. I had the honor to write to your Excellency on the 23rd November, informing you that the definitive Treaty was arrived, and that the last article of it declares that it should be ratified & exchanged within six months from its Signature. Yesterday I again writ to your Excellency by order of Congress informing you that only Seven States were represented in Congress viz. Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia & North Carolina, and that the ratification of the definitive Treaty & several other matters of the greatest consequence were delayed by want of a representation of Nine States. My Letter of yesterday was forwarded by the post, but as Congress are strongly impressed with an apprehension that the time mentioned in the definitive Treaty will elapse, before a representation of nine States can be obtained, and as such a representation cannot take place unless New Jersey and Connecticut send on their delegates, they have instructed me to write to you by Express,(1) and to urge in the strongest terms the importance of an immediate representation in Congress from the State of New-Jersey. Let me therefore entreat your Excellency to use your influence on this important point, that the con- DECEMBER 24, 1783  sequences to be expected from the Want of an immediate representation of nine States may not be imputable to your State, which on every former Occasion has exerted itself with so much honor and reputation. New Hampshire has but one Member attending, and there is no probability of a representation of that State in less than Six Weeks. New York has no delegates in Congress, nor can it be represented in many Weeks. South Carolina has one member attending; one of the delegates from that State is in ill health at Philadelphia; his attendance uncertain. By letters from Georgia we find there is no probability of a representation from thence this Winter; from this view of our situation your Excellency will observe that the Ratification of the definitive Treaty in proper time, depends upon the immediate exertions of New Jersey & Connecticut. I should be glad to know from your Excellency by the return of this Express, at what time we may expect a representation from your State. I have the honor to be with the highest respect & Esteem Your Excellency's obed. & hble Servt. Thomas Mifflin N.B.

 James Tilton to Gunning Bedford, Jr. Annapolis, Christmas Day, 1783. The General came to town last Friday, and announced his arrival, by a letter to congress, requesting to know, in what manner they chused he should resign his authority; whether by private letter or public audience? The latter was preferred without hesitation. Some etiquette being settled on Saturday, a public dinner was ordered on Monday and the audience to be on Tuesday. The feast on Monday was the most extraordinary I ever attended. Between 2 and 3 hundred Gentn: dined together in the ball-room. The number of cheerful voices, with the clangor of knives and forks made a din of a very extraordinary nature and most delightful influence. Every man seemed to be in heaven or so absored in the pleasures of imagination, as to neglect the more sordid appetites, for not a soul got drunk, though there was wine in plenty and the usual number of 13 toasts drank, besides one given afterwards by the General which you ought to be acquainted with: it is as follows. 'Competent powers to congress for general purposes.'  In the evening of the same day, the Governor gave a ball at the State House.1 To light the rooms every window was illuminated. Here the company was equally numerous, and more brilliant, consisting of ladies and Gentn: Such was my villanous awkwardness, that I could not venture to dance on this occasion, you must therefore annex to it a cleverer Idea, than is to be expected from such a mortified whelp as I am. The General danced every set, that all the ladies might have the pleasure of dancing with him, or as it has since been handsomely expressed, get a touch of him. Tuesday morning, Congress met, and took their seats in order, all covered.(2) At twelve o'clock the General was introduced by the Secretary, and seated opposite to the president, until the throng, that filled all the avenues, were so disposed of as to behold the solemnity. The ladies occupied the gallery, as full as it would hold, the Gentn. crouded below stairs. Silence ordered, by the Secretary, the Genl. rose & bowed to congress, who uncovered but did not bow. He then delivered his speech, and at the close of it, drew his commission from his bosom & handed it to the president. The president replied in a set speech, the General bowed again to Congress, they uncovered & the General retired. After a little pause, the company withdrew, Congress adjourned. The General then steped into the room again, bid every member farewell and rode off from the door intent upon eating his christmas dinner at home. Many of the spectators particularly the fair ones shed tears, on this solemn & affecting occasion. Sir  DECEMBER 26, 1783  Robert Eden & Mr. Harford (3) attended very respectfuly. They were also at the public dinner & the dance,(4) and Master Harford was so gay as to say that he would show away if the State would give him any thing to do it with. Before this comes to hand, President V. Dyke will make you acquainted with the contents of an express, sent by congress to the executives of all the unrepresented states to the eastward, viz. Jersey, N. York, & Connecticut. President V. Dyke was addressed among the rest, because Mr. McComb informed Congress, he could stay no longer than next day after tomorrow (5)--When we shall not have a congress.(6)  MS not found; reprinted from Washington, Writings (Fitzpatrick), 27:285-86; and Parke-Bernet Galleries Catalog, no. 103 (April 1939), item 475.

Letter of the 9th Instant I had the honr. to receive on the 24th and am sorry to find I must still continue without a Colleague, at a time, when a full representation appears to me so necessary to the public good. Only seven States have been represented since the meeting of Congress in this City: a resolve lately passed & forwarded to the States relative to a representation, renders it unecessary for me to say any thing on that subject. It is unfortunate for me that your Honr. was not apprised of Genl. Sulivans journey here, which prevented the Bills you are pleased to mention from being forwarded by him, as I have been obliged for some time past to borrow Cash and fear it may be wanted before it will be in my power to repay it; however I will do as well as I can, and in  DECEMBER 26, 1783  the mean time, must beg the favor that Money or Bills may be sent as soon as possible. I wish to know the pleasure of the Genl. Assembly on the subject of my continuance in Congress, in case another Delegate does not come on, as it appears to me the advantage of one Delegate only, will hardly counterballance the expense. If Nine States were present for 2 or 3 Months, it is the opinion of those Delegates present, that the businiss might be compleated & Congress resolved into a Committee of the States. On the 19th Instant Genl. Washington arrived in this City: on the 20th He signified to Congress his desire to resign his Command & retire to private life. On the 23d his Excellency was admitted to an Audience and Adressed Congress, at the close of which he delivered his Commission into the Presidents Hand, and after retiring to his place was adressed from the Chair.

Mr. Hill put into my hands a paper which I then thought to be a petition from the officers of our Line to the General Assembly, but find it to contain nothing more than a few Crude remarks calculated I suppose to Found a petition on. Mr. Hill told me the Assembly were in some measure at a loss how to act on it, & judge it most expedient to lodge it with their Deligates in Congress to make such advantage of it as they should find the complexion of Congress would admit of--from the Conversation I had with you I am more fully possessed of the Subject than this paper could make me. I can't yet form a judgement how far or to what effect the matter can be pushed in Congress. I am however of opinion that it should be introduced by a petition regularly executed by a representation of the Officers, if it was accompanied by directions in writing from the Assembly or Council to lay it before Congress it would give it Additional weight. I see that Connecticut Claims the lands westward of Pennsylvania, from the 41st to the 42 degree of Latitude,(1) & Massachusets, (I find from their deligates) will claim the higher latitudes, but these wild indefinite claims must doubtless fall to the ground. There are no more than Seven States represented in Congress which embarrase them much & prevents their immediately entering on business of great consequence. Pray let me hear from you soon & give me the history of the proceedings of yr. Council as far as it may be proper I should be acquainted with them. I am Dear Irvine, Your Obedt. & Hble. Servt. Edwd.

12394,dg021178,1783,Thomas Jefferson s Draft Resolution,"""Thomas Jefferson's Draft Resolution
  [December 27, 1783] (1) Resolved that however earnestly and anxiously Congress wish to proceed to the ratification of the Definitive treaty, yet consisting at present of seven states only they ought not to undertake that ratification without proper explanations.(2) <<1. Because the 9th article of Confederation takes from them the power, by declaring that Congress shall not 'enter into any treaty unless nine states assent to the same.'> 1. Because by the usage of modern nations it is now established that the ratification of a treaty by the sovereign power is the essential act which gives it validity; the signature of the ministers, notwithstanding their plenipotentiary commission, being understood as placing it, according to the phrase of the writers on this subject, sub spe rati, only, & as leaving to each sovereign an acknoleged right of rejection. <<2. Because it would be a precedent replete with danger to these states as under that on future occasions seven states in opposition to six may ratify treaties entered into by ministers in direct opposition to their instructions, though such instructions should have had the concurrence of nine states.> 2. Because ratification being an act of so much energy and substance, the authority to perform it is reserved to nine states by those words in the ninth article of Confederation which declare that Congress 'shall not enter into any treaty, unless nine states assent to the same.'  3. Because by the terms 'enter into a treaty' the Confederation must have intended that the assent of nine states should be necessary to it's completion as well as to it's commencement; the object having been to guard the rights of the Union in all those important cases wherein it has required the assent of nine states: whereas by admitting the contrary construction, seven states containing less than one third of the citizens of the Union in opposition to six containing more than two thirds may fasten on them a treaty, commenced indeed under commission & instructions from nine states, but concluded in express contradiction to such instructions and in direct sacrifice of the interests of so great a majority. 4. Because if 7 states be incompetent generally to the ratification of a treaty they are not made competent in this particular instance by the circumstances of the ratification of the provisional articles by nine  DECEMBER 27, 1783  states, the instructions to our ministers to form a definitive one by them and their actual agreement in substance: for either these circumstances are in themselves a ratification, or are not: if they are, nothing further is requisite than to give attested copies of them in exchange for the British ratification; if they are not, then<<^seven states have no authority to supply any circumstance wherein they are defective> we remain where we are, without a ratification by 9 states and incompetent to ratify ourselves.  5. Because the seven states now present in Congress saw this question in the same point of view only 4 days ago when by their unanimous resolution they declared that the assent of nine states was requisite to ratify this treaty and urged this as a reason to hasten forward the absent states. 6. Because such a ratification would be rejected by the other contracting party as null & unauthorized, or, if attested to them by the seal of the states, without apprising them that it has been expedited by order of seven states only, it will be a breach of faith in us, a prostitution of our seal, & a future ground, when that circumstance shall become known, of denying the validity of a ratification into which they shall have been so surprised. 7. Because there being still 67 days before the exchange of ratifications is requisite, <<we may yet hope the presence of 9 states in time> and two(3) states only wanting to render us competent, we have the strongest presumptions that the measures taken by Congress will bring them forward in time for ratification & for it's passage across the Atlantic. And 8 because should we be disappointed in this hope, the ratification will yet be placed on more honourable and defensible ground if made by 9 states as soon as so many shall be present, and then sent for exchange, urging in it's support the small importance of an exchange of ratifications, a few days sooner or later, the actual impossibility of an earlier compliance, and that failures produced by circumstances not under the controul of the parties, either in points so immaterial as to call for no compensation, or in those which are material and admit of compensation, can never affect the validity of the treaty itself.

  Sir, Annapolis 30th December 1783. Since the last Letter which I had the honor to write your Excellency,(1) containing intelligence drawn from communications made by our Ministers at foreign Courts, nothing material has occurred, save the resignation of our commander in Chief on the 23d of this month, of which you will no doubt have seen a printed account, more accurate than any I could give, before this reaches you. Saturday last was the day I had appointed to leave Congress, and on Sunday my servant arrived here, having been sent for me: but as he brought an account of the general health of my friends, and as my leaving Congress at this time would have broke up the Council of the United States, I was induced to consent to continue here 8 or 10 days longer, in hopes that before the end of those days there will be a representation from nine States to ratify the definitive Treaty, and to take up some other business of importance now before Congress. I have given Mr. Bedford notice of my determination by the Post (2) which will convey this Letter. As the office of Auditor of Accounts will require much of my attention for at least twelve months to come, and render it impracticable for me to give punctual attendance in Congress, I have come to a Resolution of resigning my Seat. I must therefore request your Excellency will be so obliging, when you go to Dover, as to present my duty to the Honble. the General Assembly, and inform them that, altho' I think myself much honored by being one of their Delegates to Congress, yet, finding the duties of that appointment do interfere with those of Auditor of Accounts, I must beg leave to resign my Seat, that I may, without interruption, attend to the business of the other, less honorable, more laborious, and in our situation, equally important office. I wish Sir, this business may be taken up immediately after the meeting of the Assembly. The present Delegates cannot serve longer than to the 1st day of February next,(3) and unless there should be a House pretty early in January, and this business be made their first care, the State will be unrepresented. I have observed that the Delegates in most of the other States have their appointments for one year to commence from and after the first Monday in November, and untill others shall appear to take their Seats. By this means they keep up a constant representation. The General Assembly of this State rose on Friday last, having among other Laws, passed an Act empowering Congress to regulate Trade. The General Assembly of Virginia have passed a similar Law, and have also confirmed the Cession of the Western Country.

It is Whether Seven States in Congress assembled are competent to a Ratification of the Definitive Treaty.(1) On this Point we request a positive Instruction from Council. It may be proper to inform your Excellency that the Gentlemen who made & seconded the Motion for a Ratification by Seven States alledged \""That Congress, consisting of Nine States viz Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia & No Carolina, did on the 29th of October last at Princeton authorize and instruct their Ministers at Paris to make the Preliminary Articles a Definitive Treaty of Peace. That Nine States having declared What Articles should constitute the Definitive Treaty; and the Treaty being framed according to their Declaration & Instructions, It may now be ratified by Seven States. That there is no Probability that Nine States will assemble in Time to ratify. That admitting the Question to be doubtful it would be the Excess of bad Policy to risque a Renewal of the War by delaying the Ratification of it. That the last Article of the Treaty declares it shall be ratified and exchanged in Six Months or sooner if possible. That only sixty Days now remain for the Ratification & Exchange which last must be made in Paris or London.

  Sir Annapolis, Dec. 31, 1783. Letters from Holland from the middle to the last of September inform us that the citizens of the Dutch states are all in commotion.(1) The conduct of the Prince of Orange having been such as greatly to strengthen the republican party, they are now pressing in the firmest tone a restoration of their constitutional rights. Friesland, as usual, leads the way. They have demanded of the sovereign assembly of the states that the power of the Stadtholder to change or reinforce the garrisons be limited or taken away, and that themselves be authorized to exercise in arms for the defence of their country: of 80000 men able to bear arms among them it is believed scarcely any will refuse to sign this demand. The Hollanders have referred to a Committee in their last assembly the examination of the power by which the prince undertakes to appoint flag officers of their fleet, and that he be desired to abstain from the exercise of it. There happens to be vacant the place of admiral. The other states seem to be in the same temper, and are now regularly exercising themselves in arms under the ensigns of their respective towns. Tho each state is to chuse their Stadtholder out of the Orange family they consider themselves not bound to chuse the eldest, and of course that they may chuse differ- DECEMBER 31, 1783  ent ones. The state of Europe at present seems favorable to the republican party, as the powers who might aid the prince are either fatigued with the late war, or likely to be engaged in the ensuing one. We have yet but seven states, and no more certain prospects of nine than at any time heretofore. We hope that the letters sent to the absent states will bring them forward.(2)  Reprinted from Jefferson, Papers (Boyd), 6:431-32. 1 Jefferson was referring, at least in part, to a September 28 letter from Charles W.

  Dear Sir(1) Annapolis Dec. 31. 1783. Just before I left Albemarle a proposition was started for establishing there a grammar school. You were so kind as to tell me you would write me the progress of the proposition: on my part I was to enquire for a tutor. To this I have not been inattentive. I enquired at Princetown of Dr. Witherspoon. But he informed me that that college was but just getting together again, and that no such person could of course be had there. I enquired in Philadelphia for some literary character of the Irish nation in that city. There was none such: and in the course of my enquiries I was informed that learning is but little cultivated there and that few persons have ever been known to come from that nation as tutors. I concluded on the whole then, if the scheme should be carried on and fixed on so firm a basis as that we might on it's faith venture to bring a man from his own country, it would be best for me to interest some person in Scotland to engage a good one. From that country we are surest of having sober attentive men. However this must await your information. We learn with certainty that a war in Europe is unavoidable. The two empires on one side and the Turks on the other. It is probable France and Prussia will aid the Turks. Gr. Britain is likely to be employed by Ireland. The Dutch are engaging in civil commotions the object of which is the reduction of the powers of the Stadtholder. We have yet but 7 states in Congress, and 9 are requisite to ratify the treaty. As the ratifications should be exchanged in Paris by the 3d of March this gives us great uneasiness. I am with much esteem Dr. Sir Your friend & servt, Th. Jefferson DECEMBER ? 1783  ""

  [December ? 1783] (1)  Qu. 1. Can an American citizen, adult, now inherit lands in England?  Natural subjects can inherit--Aliens cannot. There is no middle character--every man must be the one or the other of these. A Natural subject is one born within the king's allegiance & still owing allegiance. No instance can be produced in the English law, nor can it admit the idea of a person's being a natural subject and yet not owing allegiance. An alien is the subject or citizen of a foreign power.  The treaty of peace acknowleges we are no longer to owe allegiance to the king of G.B. It acknowleges us no longer as Natural subjects then. It makes us citizens of independent states; it makes us aliens then. A treaty with a foreign nation where the king's powers are competent to it as in this which is a case of peace & war, supersedes all law. If the king's powers were not competent before, the act of parliament of 1782 has made them so. An American citizen adult cannot inherit then. Qu.2. The father a British subject; the son in America, adult, and within the description of an American citizen, according to their laws. Can the son inherit?  He owes no allegiance to Great B. The treaty acknowleges he does not. But allegiance is the test of a natural subject. Were he to do an act here which would be treason in a British subject he could not be punished should he happen to go there. He owes allegiance to the states. He is an alien then and cannot inherit. Obj. The state of the father draws to it that of the son. Ans. In Villenage it does, but in no other case at the Com- [mon] law. Thus a Natural subject having a son born in a foreign state; the son was an alien at the Com. law. The stat. 25.E.3. st.2. first naturalized him if both parents were, at the  DECEMBER ? 1783  time of his birth, natural subjects; & 7.Ann.c.5. & 4.G.2.c.2l. where the father alone was. So an Alien in England having a child born there, that child is a natural subject. A denizen purchases land. His children born before denization cannot inherit, but those born after may. The state of the father then does not draw to it that of the child, at the Com. law. But does it by the statutes? No, for here are statutes first making the son born abroad a natural subject, owing allegiance. Then comes a treaty of peace wherein the king absolves him from his allegiance & declares him an Alien. This then supersedes the authority of the statute. It is said 2.P.W.124. 1.B1.357. that natural allegiance cannot be cancelled but by act of parl[iament].(2) But surely national treaties supersede acts of parl. The oath of allegiance took it's origin from the feudal oath of fealty. But as the fealty of the vassal could be relinquished by the lord, so can the allegiance of the subject by the king. If he withdraws his protection allegiance is gone. But he can withdraw his protection without consulting parliament. Qu. Were the k[ing]'s subjects in France aliens? If they were not, did they not become so when given up? Must they not of course become so when taken from him by a superior power?  Qu. 3. The father a British subject. The son as in Qu. 2. but an infant. Can he inherit? 1st. by the Common law. We have seen before that the state of the father does not draw to it as an accessory that of the son where he is an adult. But by the common law. Denization may be 1. by parliamt. 2. by letters pat[ent]. 3. by Conquest. As if the k[ing] & his subjects conquer a kingdom, they become denizens of kingdom conquered. Calvin's ca. 6.a. If an alien have issue born within the k[ing]'s obedience, the issue is a natural only: ib. This excludes enemies possess[in]g a town &c. ib. Abjuratur still owes allegiance because he may be restored. 9.b. So an outlaw. ib. 14.a. The law of nature is part of the law of Engld. 12.b.  If a noble of another country come to Engld., he sues by his proper name, not by that of his nobility, because on a plea in abatemt that he is not noble, it is not tried by jury but by the record of parliamt. 15.a. Ambassadors having children born in foreign nation, they are naturl subjects by the com. law. 18.a.  While the kings of Engld. had possessions in France, those born during such possession were naturl subjs. of Engld. 19.a. So is it now of Ireland, Jersey, Guernsey, Man, Alderney, &c. If a woman alien marrieth a subject she shall not be endowed. 25.a. An alien cannot be ten[ant] by the courtesy. ib. If Engld & Scotld. sh[oul]d by descent be divided & governed by several kings, those born under one sovereign while the realms were united would remain natural subjects & not aliens. 27.b. He cannot be a subject born of one kingdom that was born under the ligiance of a king of another kingdom. 18.a. ""

  Dear Sir. In Congress Jany. 14th. 1783 [i.e. 1784]  The Ratification having this day, the first on which nine States were represented, been unanimously passd; a special Messenger will be immediately dispatchd with it (1) which gives me an opportunity of writing a few words to you which may arrive speedily & safely. The department of foreing Affairs being not yet filld, the business is of course in disorder & neglected. The arrangement of that department, & the appointment of a Minister to England, will soon be taken up. I cannot say who will be chosen Secretary for foreign Affairs; but I think you stand fairest for the Embassy to the Court of St. James. Dr. F. has desird leave to resign unless his grandson is appointed Minister to some Court. Neither of these things had been yet noticd. The latter I beleive will hardly be agreed to. The resignation many desire to accept, & if it can be carried Mr. Jay's merit, will probably place him in the old man's place. We are sensible that to the firmness & integrity of yourself & of the former Gentleman, we owe the peace; the good conditions, & our escape from the snares of an artful friend. Snares infinitly more dangerous to the Independence, honor & happiness of the U. S. than the arms of the most powerful Enemy can ever be. Powers to you, Mr. Jay & Dr. F. (provided he remains) will be sent, I beleive, soon, constituting you joint negociators of treaties with such nations as may propose to be so connected with us. The present Express goes so instantaneously that it cannot as I wishd be done in time for him. The 5 per Ct. Impost gains ground but Connecticut & Rhode Island seem very little disposd to it as yet. The Commutation or half-pay to the Army is strongly remonstrated against by the former.(2) Virginia has passed an Act for ceding all the ultramontane Country, northwest of the Ohio, to the U. S. This is the fund on which I rely for the payment of our public debt, & supporting the future expence of the Union. The finest & most fertile Country in the world, if properly managd  JANUARY 14, 1784  will be a source of wealth to the U. S. superior to that of any Power upon Earth. The Officers of our late Army, have constituted themselves a perpetual Body under the title of Cincinnati. Genl. Washington is at their head. It gives alarm to the People, & this seems to increase. To one of your discernment it is unnecessary to say what may probably be the consequences of such an Association. It is conjecturd that the french are at the bottom of it. What intentions some may have in it, I will not conjecture; but very manifestly it may be productive of monarchy in this Country. If you think it will be acceptable to Mr. Jay, I shoud wish you to make my respects to him. His conduct abroad has given me the highest opinion of his abilities & virtue. Col. Harmar (who is sent with the Ratification) is a gentleman of very approvd integrity, & on whom you may rely shoud you want a person of such a character. Farewell, AL. P. S. Mr. Dana arrivd at Boston from Petersburg a few weeks since. P.S. I presume you have heard that Dr. F. has written to Congress against you. His enmity you cannot be a stranger to, & you will be inducd to dispise this effort of it, when I assure you it, has no manner of effect. It is however justice due to him to say that he allows you to be sensible & honest.(3) ""

  Sir, Annapolis Decr 14th. 1783 [i.e., January 14, 1784] (1) I had the Pleasure of seeing Mr Thaxter your late private Secretary at Philadelphia. Congress were then on their Way to this Place. He being anxious to return to Masstts it was not tho't expedient for him to come on here, as he delivered his Dispatches to the President of Congress in Philadela. & as it did not seem probable that Congress would be soon assembled at this Place. This is the first Day we have had nine States assembled. About fifteen Days since, having then no Prospect of nine States, it was moved that seven States should proceed to ratify the Definitive Treaty.(2) The Competency of seven States was urged upon these Grounds, that Nine States had ratified the Provisional Treaty, the Articles of which constituted the definitive. That Nine States did in October last instruct our Ministers commissioned to make Peace to adopt the Provisional Articles as a definitive Treaty  JANUARY 14, 1784  unless farther Advantages for the United States would be obtain'd. That the Ratification had become mere Matter of Form. That seven States might expedite it & the United States would be bound thereby. That the Time for exchanging Ratifications would expire on the 3d of March. That if not exchanged on or before that Time, the Provisional Treaty would be at an End, & it would be in the Option of G. Bn. after that Time to accept it, or not as she should think proper. These Assertions, excepting the Matters of Fact, were very warmly opposed--& Congress being pretty equally divided, the Matter was of Course delayed till this Day. I hope Colo. Hermer who is entrusted with the Ratification will arrive before the Time expires for exhanging it. In some of your Letters you seem to be in Opinion that there is an absolute Necessity of braceing up the Confederation, That Funds are necessary for supporting the Credit of the United States.(3) I cannot collect your Ideas precisely--But I am apprehensive that if you were here, you would find it very difficult to establish Funds that would not have a Tendency to destroy the Liberties of this Country. Our Embarassments are very great. Our Danger lies in this--That if permanent Funds are given to Congress, the aristocratical Influence, which predominates in more than a Major Part of the United States will finally establish an arbitrary Government in the United States. I do most heartily wish there was no continental Treasury & that our Debt was equitably divided among the several States. In the Way of this, lays our foreign Debt--perhaps it would be better to establish Funds for this alone. But it is impossible to say what the States will do as to Funds. Congress have none as yet & I am apprehensive they will not have any permanent ones--many of the States are very Jealous. Every State imagines or pretends to imagine that they have very large Demands against the United States. The Accounts are unadjusted & I fear it is the Policy of some States to keep them forever in that Situation. This becomes every Day more & more serious. Our State is very deeply interested in it. She is now uneasy about it & that Uneasiness must encrease--for her Delegates however powerful & Eloquent will never be able to argue the Money out of the Pockets of the Citizens of another State into those of our own. At least Appearances are against it at present. Time will discover whether our Union is natural; or rather whether the Dispositions & Views of the several Parts of the Continent are so similar as that they can & will be happy under the same Form of Government. There is too much Reason to believe they are not.  I have been in Congress sometime & intend to leave it forever in four or five Weeks. I have not done myself the Honor to write you from Time to Time; for which Omission I hold myself unexceuseable--Tho' I dont know of any Information I could have communi-  cated, which would have essentially altered any Thing. I have seen the Days of Servility, if not of Corruption & I weep over them. Congress, I think, will certainly adjourn the Beginning of May next to the first Monday in November following. The Business has greatly diminished since Peace took Place. There are a few Objects of great Magnitude which require the Assent of Nine States. Our Army is dismissed saving about five hundred Men. It now remains with Congress to determine whether they will maintain any Men at the Expence of the United States. The Question has been warmly debated in Congress--but no Decision. The Opponents say that the Confederation gives Congress no Power to keep up Troops in a Time of Peace. There is an inconquerable Aversion in many to any Thing that looks like a standing Army in Time of Peace. They will therefore have no Nest Egg, & why may not every State provide for its own Garrisons. The Confederation speaks this Language. The Question will not obtain in the present Congress. The Civil List must be put upon a new footing before Congress Adjourn. A very important Report respecting the future Negociations with the Indians is now before Congress & will require very close Attention.(4) This is a very delicate Business as it respects the several States. I expect N-- Y--k will purchase all our western Territory of the Indians, before we know it. They are really to cunning for M--tts in Matters of Land.  A general Plan for entering into Commercial Treaties must be matured & adopted before the recess. And I think by the present Appearance in Congress the Interest of the United States will be the governing Principle. Last November brot about a capital Revolution in Congress. The Limitation of three years struck off a Number indeed all the prime Actors in the late strange & unnatural System of our foreign Affairs.(5) Our State have instructed us to urge a new Arrangement of the Office of Finance. They seem to apprehend that such an Office in the Hands of one Person is incompatible with the Liberties of this Country. A Board in Commission is their Object. The one & the other have very weighty Objections. I wish there was no Occassion for either. I understand the united Netherlands have no public Chest.  Our late Officers having formed themselves into a Society by the Name of the Cincinnati. The Institution begins to be attended to & by many judicious Persons it is thot that in Time it will be very dangerous. It is suggested that the Idea did not originate on this side the Atlantic. Latet Anguis in Herba.(6) Surely this Country will not consent to a Race of Hereditary Patricians. There are many others besides the officers whose Names ought & will be immortalized for their Conduct during the late War.  If you should receive a long Letter the Writer desires you to consider that the Front Sheet was not intented for you. The short Notice he had of this Opportunity did not permit him to Copy it. He was   obliged to send it in the present Form or not at all. The Beginning of it will be unintelligible. With very great Respect, I am Sir Your most humble Servt. Samuel Osgood  ""

  Dear Sir Annapolis Jany 18. 84. When I had the pleasure of serving with you in Congress, I parted with to you a number of Certificates, which I have since discovered woud have a value in my hands which they can have with no other person. The circumstances which give them this value are too long & complicated to detail, but are yet extremely cogent & pressing. I woud therefore be very happy to repurchase them of you at the value which such certificates are of, or if more agreable replace them with others that woud be of equal value to you. As this will be obliging me extremely & cannot possibly be injurious to you I have no doubt of you finding pleasure in a compliance with my request. I have engag'd of my friend Colo. Monroe to negociate this business with you.(1) With wishes for your happiness, I am Dr Sir, Yr. mo. Ob. Sert. John F. Mercer ""

  Sir, Annapolis 20th Jany. l784. It was with pleasure I received your communication of the 28 December 1783,(1) appointing the city of Philadelphia to be the place for the general meeting of the society of Cincinnati, on the first Monday in May next, agreeably to the original institution.  I am convinced, sir, you may rely on the punctual attendance of the delegates of the Delaware state society. It was not without mature deliberation, in several meetings, that the officers of the Delaware line entered into the association; and not before they had considered the objects of it as laudable, and the means of attainment as adequate to the ends proposed. I know therefore the delegates will consider themselves as inexcuseable for the least neglect. I have written a notification to Major James Moore (late Captn. Moore) who is one of the two appointed to represent our little society. He is a man of excellent character and can attend without inconveniency. And having myself the honor to be the other representative, I shall be ambitious to attend the first general meeting. I have the honor to be, sir, with all the respect that I ought, Your most obt. servt. James Tilton JANUARY 20, 1784  Portrait of  James Tilton JANUARY 21, 1784  ""

  Dr. Gerry, 31st. March [17]85. We have a Letter from Mr. J. Adams dated Auteil 10th Jany. 85---; which informs that by a Letter from his Bankers at Amsterdam he learns that the last loan is nearly complete(1)---;of consequence we must have in Europe subject to the order of Congress a very considerable sum of money. Mr. Adams advises to the opening of a new loan, but laments that he has put his hand heretofore to contracts which leave so heavy a load on his fellow Citizens, and which will prove so injurious a drain of the industrious earnings of his country men. Some how or other this is inconsistent. Mr. A. laments our burdens yet advises an increase of them. I do not know why we shd. borrow more money.(2) Nothing new has taken place in Congress, we are now warmly entered into the business of requisition for money, Troops &c. My Colleague the Doctor has been sick this week past, and we are unrepresented. However I hope he will soon be out. Adieu R King [P.S.] You will observe this to be a Letter written in Congress &ca. I send you News papers &c. ""
