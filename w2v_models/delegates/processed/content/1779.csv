  My dear Sir Jany 3-79 I embrace the opportunity which now offers of writing a few Lines to you. In my last I told you I had many things to say particularly concerning A L & S D Esqrs.(1) If I could have the Pleasure of sitting with you by a fire Side, I would more freely open my Mind to you than I chuse to do upon Paper, considering the Risque of its falling into wrong hands. One of these gentlemen, as I was informd in the year 74 by some who were well acquainted with him, was of a dubious political Character, and was appointed a Delegate in Congress by a Majority of only one of the Electors; it being thought that his own Vote turnd it in his favor. In 75 he was again elected; and he very JANUARY 3, 1779  early attachd himself to Men of different Sentiments from those which most if not all your Delegates brought with them from your Country & strenuously maintaind. This Difference of Sentiment was said to arise from local Attachments, but in Reality they arose from different Principles & Views. What Mr Ds political Principles were if he had any I never could learn. His Views always appeard to me commercial & interrested. Whether I was mistaken or not Time perhaps will soon discover. He was very little known in America till the year 75, if at all in Europe.  The other took an early, decided and active Part in Support of our great Cause. In London he had a great Share in the open opposition made to the Tyranny of the British Court & their Measures respecting America. There he turnd his Attention from the Practice of Physick to which he had been regularly educated in Edinburgh, to the Study of the Law. This he did by the Advice of some of the most able Advocates for the Liberties of America, from the opinion they had conceivd of his promising Usefulness to that Cause in that Way. He answered their Prospects. He constantly aided your Agent the late Mr De Berdt (2) to whom his Knowledge of Affairs rendered his Services essential. That his Pen was employd for America in General, his Junius Americanus abundantly testifies; and that, and his other Publications witness his Attachments to Massachusetts Bay & South Carolina in particular. His private Letters to his Friends were written with that Freedom as well as Zeal, which would have exposd him to the Risque even of his Life from the Resentment of an unprincipled & nefarious Court, if any of them by Accident or Design had fallen into their Hands. This I know to be true. I must conclude at present with giving it to you as my fix'd Opinion, founded on particular observations, that there is a joynt Combination of political & commercial Men to exclude all vigilant Patriots from publick Councils & Employments knowing that Vigilance & unimpeachd, unsuspected Fidelity will be an effectual Bar to the carrying such politico commercial Plans into Execution.(3) I will write to you again by the first good Opportunity. In the mean time I am with perfect Esteem,  Yr affectionate Friend ""

  Sir, Philad. 3d Jany. 1779. I have now the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your Excellency's favor to me, and to the Delegates collectively.(1) The letter with the enclosures were delivered to the President, as we consider the subject of the revolt from our state particularly within his province; he being delegated for the express purpose. I cannot but think he will be at a loss for the maps whenever he finds an opportunity to take it up: your Excellency's remarks ought certainly to hasten a determination: for a more favorable conjuncture than the present is hardly to be expected. Mr. Jay has not yet held any conference with his colleagues on this interesting business: but intends soon to form a resolution, and prepare the way for its successful reception.(2) With respect to your favor to me individually it is only necessary to observe that any assurance for the faithful application of the Specie remitted to you by Congress must be totally Superfluous.(3)  When I joined Congress I found they had for some time been engaged in the business of Finance, but had made an inconsiderable progress. As Chairman of the Treasury I was officially called to an active part. It was not till yesterday that Congress agreed on a plan for funding the money emitted in Bills of Credit; a copy will be transmitted to your Excellency by the President; to give conveyance to which I have ventured to detain the express two days. If the different legislatures heartily support the arrangement proposed by Congress, I flatter myself the public credit will be restored: for sufficient and known funds being once established for sinking the debt in a reasonable period, the good sense as well as monied interest of America will be on the side of government. The danger lies not in the past; but the future increase of paper money, should the war unhappily be protracted. To prevent such increase it is proposed to JANUARY 3, 1779  borrow money; abroad for supplies of clothing, arms, and ammunition; at home for pay and subsistence. The first will be promoted by our ally; the last by the security derived from our sinking fund; by an immediate tax to the amount of near one fifth of the paper in circulation, and by proscribing and calling in two large emissions, which are now in circulation and artfully counterfeited. It is true the bills of those emissions may be exchanged for others where the holder prefers it to loan office certificates: but in most cases he will choose the latter: because from necessity he must wait some time before the bills for the exchange can be prepared and transmitted. Should all this fail, other means must be found out to encourage the loan. I think they are within our reach. This is however a very delicate Subject. It must readily occur that it would be pernicious to give the paper money a great and sudden appreciation. As a medium it has passed from the public for more than five for one during the last ten months in which by far the greatest part of our debt has accrued. If it should be redeemed on a par, or at three or even four for one, the public would pay a premium for their supplies greater than ever was known, or which the richest nation could bear. True policy therefore lies in inclining the money towards an appreciation for the present; from the nature of things when the war closes commerce revives, and the quantity is diminished by the operation of taxes it must rise in estimation. In all probability the bills which shall last be cancelled will be equal to the nominal value compared with specie; and that they will gradually grow better as they approach nearer and nearer to that period. I am aware of the uncertainty of all speculations upon this intricate subject.(4)The remedy must be addressed to the reason as well as the Avarice of the people.  Yesterday Col. Floyd Joind Us (5) with an Intention of continuing here till the first of April His Affairs he says will then call him home, & he must watch the Moment when he may repossess his Estate. The Consequence I fear will be that this Winter we shall have five Delegates when three woud have served very well: & next Summer we shall probably be without a Representation. This I know was not the Meaning of the Legislature; they do not wish to be so profuse of their Money; & meant that three shoud statedly serve and the other two be a Relief at seasonable periods. I wish the Legislature woud empower your Excellency to settle our Ration of duty: it is really necessary & I feel myself particularly interested in it. It will give your Excellency Pleasure that Mr Duer has left Congress with high Reputation. His abilities and Perseverance and his extensive Knowledge of whatever concernd the Army reflected Honour on the State from which he came; and tho' he has some Enemies, has secured him a place among the respectable Patriots and publick servants of these States.   Love of Justice will engage your Excellency, without arguments, to represent him to his Constituents in the Light he deserves. You may remember, Sir, his Resignation was accepted in Silence and he apprehends with cold Indifference. My Feelings were hurt to find a Gent. who had been so active in our Cause and had discharged his several Employments with the most painful Solicitude and unwearied Diligence mortified under a seeming neglect for intentional it coud not possibly have been.  Be pleased Sir to accept and to entreat Mrs. Clinton to accept the Compliments of the Season and my best Wishes for your Happiness.  I am, with the highest Respect, Sir, Your Excellency's most Obedt humble Servant. Jas. Duane  ""

  My Dear Sir, Philadelphia 3d January 1779 Your friendly Favour of the 5th of December gave me great Pleasure. I feel that you do me no more than Justice in believing that I deeply interest myself in the Happiness of your Branch of our Family: to contribute to it in any degree woud afford me the highest Gratification. In the Instance you do me the Honour to point out I have made all the Enquiry in my Power. Not one of our old Md Friends are here, except Paca, and he resides very distant from the Family in Question: I have therefore been under a necessity of using the greater Caution. I learn only that it is very reputable, but this is thro' a Gent. not sufficiently acquainted to ascertain their Fortune and Connections, which you wish to know.  It is my misfortune that I missed the Opportunity of conversing with you on the State of of our Publick affairs before I set out on my Journey. I fully intended it, convinced that I shoud have been furnished with many useful Hints & much profitable Information: & particularly on a Subject of the most Importance-I mean our Finances. On taking my Seat I found Congress had for some time  JANUARY 3, 1779  been contemplating & talking over this Business: but nothing had been done conclusively. As I was obliged to resume my place at the Treasury, Geary being literally worn down, & no other Member having a knowledge of our money matters sufficiently comprehensive, I was officially called upon to take an active part in Arranging our Finances. What has been done you will see from the Resolution now forwarded to the Governour.(1) If the Legislatures support the views of Congress I have no doubt but that we shall be able to restore Publick Credit. Let the present debt be properly funded and the good Sense as well as the monied Interest of America will be on our Side; for you will readily See that the whole of the present Emissions can by a moderate Tax be sunk within the Compass of eighteen years. Where then is the danger? Not in the past, but in the future Exercise of paper money. To prevent such an Encrease we must borrow; ABROAD for cloathing, Arms, Artillery and Ammunition; AT HOME for pay and subsistance. The first will be promoted by our Alliance; the last by the Security derivd from the sinking fund; by an immediate Tax to the amount of a Sixth of the Sum in Circulation; & by proscribing two of the Emissions which are greatly counterfeited. It is true the Bills of those Emissions may be exchanged for others if the holder prefers it to a Loan Office Certificate: But in most cases he will choose the latter, because, from necessity, he must wait some time before the Bills of Exchange can be proposed & transmitted. Shoud all this prove ineffectual other means must be found out to promote the Loan. I think they are within our Reach; This is a very Delicate Subject. You will easily see that it woud be fatal Policy to give the paper money a sudden & extensive Appreciation. On a medium it has not passed for more than five for one the last ten months. If it is to be redeemed on a par or for three or even four for one the publick woud pay a higher premium than ever was known, or which any nation coud bear: True wisdom therefore lies in inclining the money towards an Appreciation for the present: from the Nature of things when the War ceases & the Quantity is diminished by the operation of Taxes, it must rise in Value: In all probability the Bills which shall be last cancelled will be equal to the nominal Value compared with Specie. I shall transcribe these Hints respecting our finances for the Governour. You will communicate them to our Friends if of moment.  My Friend Col. H.B. Livingston has passed some Time with us. We lodged in the same House. I have twice been on a party to Visit Mr & Mrs. C. Livingston. He is a favorite in that Family. His military Reputation is high in Congress. They see with Reluctance his Intentions to Resign, & to give Time for Reflection have referred his Letter on that Subject to the Board of War. If he persists it must I suppose be accepted.(2) Interested as I find myself in his Welfare I   have taken the Liberty to advise him to serve another Campaign. I believe I made but little Impression. About three weeks ago he went to the Northward: with an Intention I conjecture to pass some time with your Lady's Family in the Valley. I do not think he is insensible of the charms of the Ladies in that Quarter; particularly of Miss Rutherford's. Duer was to have accompanied him in order it is reported to put an End to long Courtship by a happy Marriage. He is detaind here having taken up the Pen for Mr. Deane against Common Sense,(3) & to settle a Mercantile Connection which promises much advantage. You may be assured that his Abilities & Perseverance in Congress have done Honour to our state and great Service to the Publick Cause: particularly at the close of last Winter. From the Delegates of one of the States he has had the Compliments of requesting his Picture as a distinguished Patriot. He is hurt at the Coldness of our Legislature who have paid him not the least Compliment on his Resignation but seemd to accept as a matter of Indifference Convinced of the Truth of the Maxim that a Prophet has no Honour in his own Country, he must be contented with his Continental Character which notwithstanding he has some Enemies is very respectable.  I am affected with Mr. Tetards Circumstances. Let me know whether he woud wish to be Chaplain at the Forts in the Highland & whether there is a Vacancy. I will get it for him or any thing else which can be pointed out & my good offices can procure.  Is it your Opinion that Genl. Schuyler ought to continue in the Army, or to accept of the Presidency of Congress, which is intended for him? Will not the former be more advantageous to the publick & to our State in particular. Is it not more for his own Honour to be second in the Command of our Army, than to take the Chair for a year on Condition that he resigns his Military Employment7 I am clear for his Continuing in the Army. He is now honourably acquitted from every Imputation & Suspicion, & his Enemies put to Shame or at least to silence. He can do as much real Service as any Individual especially preventing the misapplication of our Force, & retrenching the publick Expenses. He stands high with the Army & the Commander in Chief. His advice with respect to the Defence of our State will from his Intimate Knowledge of the Country be decisive.  Consider these Remarks and if they make an Impression give him your advice.  Col. Floyd arrivd here yesterday. We have now five members: in the Summer I suppose we shall have none for he tells me that he can serve no longer than until the first part of April. The Intention of the Legislature was to have three always on Duty, which by a proper Rotation might have been effected. Woud it not be wise to  give the power of fixing the Rotation to the Governour? It was expected we shoud have done it ourselves, but the Col. never consulted us about this Journey: I indeed told him at Poghkeepsie that I expected he woud relieve me the first of May: but his appointment is not like to give us the least Recess.  Present my affectionate Compliments to your Momma & Your Lady & Sisters. My friend John I presume is at Boston. To all I wish a Series of happy years, Being with real Esteem, Dear Sir, Your most obedient & Affectionate Servant, Jas. Duane  ""

  My dear General Philad. 3d Jany 1779. Since I came to this City I have written to you twice.(1) The last enclosd an Account of your being acquitted with the Highest Honour by a general Court martial and the Confirmation of that Sentence by Congress. I cannot account for your Omitting to answer me on a Subject which must give you the most heartfelt satisfaction. I Judge from my own feelings for I assure you such was the Impression this Event made upon me tho' more remotely interested.  I had not long been here before Mr Lawrence resignd the Chair. It was offerd to New York. We proposd you & it met with Approbation, Mr Jay in the mean time agreeing to be your locum tenens. I had no objection to this parade in your favour; but was firmly resolved that you shoud not if I coud help it quit your high Station in the Army where you may be long and so eminently serviceable to the united States & to your own in particular, for the Sake of presiding in Congress for a single Year.(2) It woud be a bad Exchange both in a publick Way and a private View: with respect to your own State which wants your utmost Attention it woud be in the highest Degree pernicious. You are popular in the Southern Army at least: you are greatly respected by the Commander in Chief: your advice will have great Weight in Congress. In short Every Measure you recommend for the protection & Safety of your Native State will have it's full weight while you are in the Army. In the chair of Congress your Lips will be sealed; and your Knowledge and abilities in a great Measure lost to your Country. I am therefore clear in my Opinion, which I flatter myself will not be slighted. If it is rejected  JANUARY 3, 1779  I look for good Reasons. Give my Compliments to Mrs Schuyler, wish her a great many happy years, And tell her that knowing her prejudices on this Subject & how much she wishes you to retire, I must insist on excluding her from our Councils, untill I can be personally heard. I know from Experience I can convince her Judgement.  General Arnold is mending. He is engagd to a Miss Peggy Shipping one of the finest & most agreeable Ladies in this City. His Leg resembles Uncle Toby's Groin. I heard two Ladies of our Acquaintance in deep debate about this same wounded Leg. They were as much perplexed as the Widow Wadman.(3) In the mean time it is the only obstacle to the Lover's Happiness. Duer is still here. He has taken up the Pen for Deane against the Employers of Payne (Common Sense). You know them all. Lady Kitty in the mean time must have Patience. He confesses his marriage with her is soon to be celebrated. The Devil take Payne say I. Congress you will see by the publications give free Scope to the Press. I hope they will no longer be chargd with Congressional Pride.  General Washington has been here ten days by order of Congress. He seems impatient to return to the Army: but the Business for which he was sent to be advised with, will detain him a few days longer. My friend Taylor writes me that you are at Saraghtoga & expresses Pain for your safety. Rashness is a folly you ought not to be chargd with, especially when it may extend to a numerous Family. Put your Family in Security & go to Business. The times are pressing & require Vigilance & Wisdom-you can't be spared. Farewell. Accept the complim[ents] of the Season to you & yours; & Believe me Sans Ceremony your affect & Obedt sert. Jas Duane  ""

The next day I attended Congress, (1) and after the usual Business of the Morning, which is the Reading of Publick Letters and Receiving Reports from the Several Committees, At one JANUARY 3, 1779  Oclock (according to a Rule of house which had been for Some time Standing that all matters be before them Should be laid by and Congress proceed upon the Business of Finance) Finance was taken up, and I soon found there was Sundry Resolutions which had been long under Consideration and at length agreed to, for the purpose of Raising the Credit of our Currentcy. Some Gentlemen appear Very Sanguine that they will have their Desired Good Effects, I wish they may; But must Confess I have Great Doubts.  The Resolves with a preamble are Gone to the printers. If I can get them before this oppertunity Leaves Town I will Send them to you. But you will undoubtedly Receive them Officially from our President very Soon.  There were two other Questions of Importance to the Several States, Adjutated; But was, in my opinion happily thrown out. The One was to prohibit all Lotteries in the Several States, and the other was to Cry Down all Bills of Credit, Except Continental.(2)  I considered the two Questions as infringing on the Rights of the Legislatures of the Several States and was Glad to have them Negatived.  The last Letters from France hold out to us, that England is on the Brink of Acknowledging our Independance, and that from Absolute necessity, as their affairs are as much Embarrassed as the public affairs of any Nation Ever was.(3)  There is No Important news here Except that Yesterday we heard that 22 Sail of the Enemys Vessels was Driven on Shore on Staten Island-which I suppose you'l hear Before this Reaches you, from Sr. your most obdit. humble Servt.

  Sir, Philadelphia 3rd Jany. 1779.  The Congress have directed me to observe to you, that the Plan for emancipating Canada was conceived at a Time when, from various movements of the Enemy there was the highest Reason to expect a  JANUARY 3, 1779  speedy & total Evacuation of all the Posts they held in these States. Those Indications however proved fallacious & the Probability of their quitting this Country in the Course of the Winter is become very slender, nor is it by any Means certain that they will do it in the Spring. Prudence therefore dictates that the arms of America should be employed in expelling the Enemy from her own shores, before the Liberation of a Neighbouring Province is undertaken. As the proportion of force necessary for our Defence must be determined by the future Operations & Designs of the Enemy which cannot now be known, and as in Case of another Campaign it may happen to be very inconvenient if not impossible for us to furnish our proposed Quota of Troops for the Emancipation of Canada, Congress think they ought not under such circumstances to draw their good Ally into a Measure the Issue of which depending on a variety of Contingencies would be very uncertain, & might be very ruinous.(1) I have the Honor to be, your most Obedt. & Hble.

  My Dear Sir, Philadelphia 3d of Jany 1779 Yesterday put a finishing stroke to the plan of finance, that was under consideration before my arrival & I suppose long before Your departure, I Heartily wish it may have the desired effect. By accots. receivd from every quarter our paper currency is in a most miserable scituation but I hope the remidies now applied will be something more than palliatives, indeed I have not the least doubt of it if the States will exert their powers to put in execution the recommendations, I flatter myself that New-H will not be deficient in that respect. Taxation is the only means to effect a cure & every state will find great advantage in taxing as high as possible while money is plenty. Connecticut (who never looses sight of her own interest) raised £800,000 last Year by Tax, which was collected in five or six different payments, this I think was a wise measure, & I wish it may be adopted by the state whose Interest I have most at heart, there are but few men but will pay £25 per Qur. with more cheerfulness than £100 per year in one payment. The two Emission which are to be paid in by the first of fune amount to 41,500,000, but this is to be redeemed partly by Loan Certificates or new money which the artificers are now preparing the Machines for, it is said this new money can not be counterfieted. I suppose it is meant not so easily counterfieted as that now in circulation, no doubt the Gentn. of the Treasury have exerted their inventive faculties to guard against the ingenuity of villains, but it must be left to time to determine their success.  Having got pretty well over finance (at least for the present) the next standing Job, (I suppose) will be Foreign Affairs. This business I expect will produce much altercation and that not without a due proportion of warmth. Our Friend who left Congress the day you did is still absent, but some late publications in the news papers will bring him back sooner than he intended.(1) He is expected very soon, all his eloquence will be used in support of his Friend & the Friends of Mr D_ (2) will equally exert themselves. For my part I shod be very willing to consign Mr. D over to Common Sence, & never hear his name mentioned again.  Congress is fuller than I ever knew it at this time of Year, all the States are represented, I wish I could say they were Confederated, but our Froward Sister M & her little Crooked Neighbour still stand out.(3)  No late accots, from Europe. The last advices from New York, say, they are in great want of Bread, & that 20 sail of outward Bound  JANUARY 4, 1779  transports, were lately drove on shore by the Ice, most of which (its said) will be lost.  There has been no post in from the Eastward for three weeks (the last letters I received from N. Hampshire were dated in Novr.) this I imagine is owing in some measure to the badness of the Roads. I have never seen so much snow in Philadelphia as within ten days past, the River is compleatly shut up. The prices of every thing here, has doubled, since you left this City.  The inclosed letter was delivered to me some days ago in the shattered condition that I inclose it, and which I trust you will find it.(4) It does not appear to me to have been opened but thouroughly worn in somebodies pocket.

  Sir. Philadelphia January 4th, 1779. We had the honor of your favor of the 8th Decemr. by Brown, (1) who arriv'd here about the 20th. Congress was then deeply engaged in the matter of finance, and in taking measures, at least, to give some check to the rapid course of depreciation of their paper currency, to relieve its sinking credit, and possibly gradually to appreciate its value. A portion of every day was set apart for that purpose, and was not closed 'till Saturday night last. We thought it prudent to detain Brown, 'till we could transmit to you the proceedings of Congress on that subject, lest his return, without any intelligence might fix the impression on the minds of the people that Congress was only amusing them with bare pretences, while in fact they meant to have the bills die in the possessors hands. We are happy that it is now in our power to transmit to Your Excellency such resolutions of Congress as we hope will wholly remove those impressions; and as, by the cooperation of the people, and the blessings of God, will give permanent credit to our bills, and furnish us still with the means of our defence. The measures at present adopted relative thereto, are herewith transmitted, which renders it needless to point out the same in this letter-possibly some other measures may be taken to restore commutative justice among the people. JANUARY 4, 1779  Your letter, and the Petition of the Officers in the Connecticut Line to our Assembly have been laid before Congress, and referred to a Committee who have not yet made their report,(2) possibly the Assembly will not think it proper to proceed any further on that subject, than to make some reasonable provision for the support of their families, in the manner already proposed, until they hear further from Congress on that head, which we hope will be in a few days. Indeed the Officers and Soldiers in the Army seem to be, in many respects, on the same footing with our Salarymen, orphans, widows, &c. and hope some measures may soon be taken, which will operate to the administering justice to the whole, as near as these calamitous times will possibly admit of.  A Foreign Loan is in contemplation, but how soon it may be effected is at present uncertain. By the best information we can obtain, the several, or most of the States, in the Union, have taken measures to fund their own bills, and have paid, and are now paying, in, the several taxes apportioned to them the last year, and all seem inclined to tax as high as possible.  You enquire, Sir, why the Articles of Confederation are not concluded. We have only to answer that the States of Maryland and Delaware have not yet acceded, and we are waiting with impatience for their union, and as the Articles drawn comprehend the Thirteen States jointly, it is at least a doubt whether the assent already gained from eleven States is not founded on the joint consent of the whole thirteen, and unless the remaining two join, the whole is void, and will make it necessary to send back to each State for their approbation, if no more than eleven States unite in the Confederation, which would take up much time, beside the inconvenience, which might attend, therefore are still waiting, in hopes of the compliance of the other two.  As to what is done in consequence of the Circular Letters sent out by the Committee to superintend the Commissary's and Quarter Master's Department, are not able to acquaint you, as the Committee have not made report, therefore must refer to Mr. Sherman, who is one of that Committee,(3) for information on that head.  The unhappy situation of our western frontiers, as well as those of New-York, are truly melancholy, and demand the greatest attention, both as respects the present inhabitants, former settlers, and the supplies derived from them. The Board of War have reported an addition to Colo. Hartley's Regiment, who is a worthy, spirited, and attentive Officer, and now on the frontier part at Wyoming: (4) we hope further additions will be made for their defence. General Washington is now in Town, on the request of Congress, and a Committee appointed to confer with him on the subject of any new, or future operations, and hope something to effect will soon be done.   Mr. Dean has been fully heard by Congress to the utmost of his wishes, but by reason of the pressure of other important business nothing is decided respecting him, or his negociations. We know not of any fault in the delay-the late publications are rather premature and unhappy-as we conceive no good will be derived from them, or useful instruction.  January the 5th. We have been obliged to detain Brown to this day, to have the Quotas of the several States affixed for their present proportion of the fifteen millions dollars tax for this year, in which is apportioned to Connecticut 1,700,000 (5)-large indeed in sound, but hope may not prove disagreeable, when it is considered, with how much more ease so large a sum may be now paid, than a much less in future, and that what they over-pay now, will be allowed to their account, and diminish our proportion of those which will suceed, beside an interest on the overplus, in the same manner as that recommended the last year. We have transmitted to Your Excellency the copies of the Resolutions of Congress on these matters, with the Quotas affixed to each State; and though thro' the diversity of the circumstances and interest of Individuals, a variety of opinions may be formed, yet we hope they will be received with candor, prove in general satisfactory, and that every one will endeavor to promote the great and good ends therein designed.  We are, with the greatest Esteem & Respect, Your Excellency's most obedt. hble Servants, Elipht. Dyer,  Oliver Ellsworth, Jesse Root.  ""

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia 4th Jany 1779 Since my last I have not been favored with any of your's-the Baron Stubens tells me he wrote to you some time ago about a Soldier that he took out of one of the New Hampshire regiments. He wishes the fellow may be released to him and he will be at the expence of recruiting another in his stead-he wishes to retain the fellow in his service but is lothe to take a soldier from the line, a custom which prevails much in our Army, which he reprobates and wishes to reform. The Baron is in very high estimation in the army, has done very essential Services and is very particularly attended to by the Commander in Chief.  A plan of finance which has been a long time under Consideration has at last got into the hands of the printer. I hope it will have the desired effect, but in order thereto it must have the most speedy assistance of the several Legislatures.  By the last advices from York we learn they are in great want of bread and that 20 sail of outward bound Transports have been lately forced ashore by the ice most of which it is said will be lost.

  My Dear Bror. Philadelphia 4th Jany. 1779 By the means of bad Roads, bad weather, or some other cause, there is now three Mails due from the Eastward, the last letters I received from N. Hampshire were dated in Novr. It is said the weather is colder here than has been for many Years past, I therefore conclude you have had a severe winter hitherto. Perhaps it may be owing to the severity of the season that we have no intelligence from Europe. By the last authentic intelligence from New-York they were intirely out of flour, & have but very little Rice, they have advice of the sailing of a fleet from Cork in Octor., which they are apprehensive are intercepted as none of them are yet arrived, we are also informed that 20 sail of outward bound Transports were lately drove ashore by the Ice most of which it's said will be lost.  As you may have a curiosity to know how much paper money is in Circulation I inclose you a particular accot of all that has been Emitted by Congress. Perhaps it may not be proper to make it very public. I shall rely on your discretion to make such use of it as prudence may dictate. If it should be propagated that a larger sum has been Emitted you will have it in your power to contradict such a report. You will also find inclosed an accot. of the perticular Emissions & Denominations that have been discovered here to have been Counterfeited, these I think have been advertised & perticularly discribd.  A plan of finance which has been a long time under consideration, is at last compleated, and I hope it will have the desired effect, it certainly will have an immediate favorable operation if the States will exercise their powers to further the views of Congress, I shall transmit you a copy of this plan by next post.  I hope you will secure a tenant for the farm at Kittery as soon as possible, if it should be let alone till the spring you will be put to great difficulty, even if you should be able to get one at any rate. Let me hear how you go on with your business at Dartmouth & if you want any information that I can collect this way respecting Mills &c &c. I wish to have a copy of the Acts passed the last Session, which you mentioned in Your last. Remember me with affection to Your Mrs. W Adieu, Yours very affectionately, WW  ""

  Sir, Philadelphia, Jan. 5th. 1779. I do myself the pleasure to enclose this day's paper to you, containing the ultimatum of Congress on the affair of Finance, and a publication from Common Sense with what other little news we have here.  The publications of Mr. Dean, and Mr. Paine, makes a great talk in this place, and I am afraid will throw Congress and the people at large into violent parties.  I am told that the late President declined his seat as president because Congress would not take up Mr. Dean's publication in a way which he thought proper. In ballotting for a new President, they came in favor of Mr. Jay, who is now our President.  There is nothing yet done with respect to the Vermont business,  JANUARY 5, 1779  not owing to any neglect of our members; but that it was not possible to bring on that, or any other matter of importance, while the grand business of Finance was under consideration. Now that is over, I expect we Shall Soon take it up, and I obtain Something decisive from Congress on the Subject.  In conversation yesterday, I mentioned the affair to Mr. Drayton who fully agreed with me that the consequences of their holding their independence would be a means of producing fifty new States, therefore must by no means be allowed.

  Dear Brot. Phila. Jan. 5. 1779 The uncertainty of the Post last week prevented me from writing, & now from the uncertainty of this Letters reaching you before you leave home, I am at a loss what to say.  Common Sense has attacked Mr Deane something in his own way, but I think has not made the best use of the materials in his hands.(1) However it appears he has stung the Gentn., for he has had the impudence to complain to Congress, of his being abused by Payne in his official character;(2) in consequence of which we have had some warm debates, not much to Mr. Deane's advantage. The impudence & villainy of this man are beyond expression; & it much increases my bad opinion of mankind, & the unfavorable prospect of our affairs, to find him so warmly supported. It appears to me at present that he will be continued in the public service, with an approbation of what he had done, but you will probably have time to be present at the shamefull decision. Your peice is in the hands of Mr. Adams for his opinion;(3) tho I am inclined to delay it till you come, as the public is likely to be intertained in the mean time. Finance is finished. 15 millions dollars raised by tax, this year, 6 millions yearly for 16 years as a sinking fund. The two last large emissions, amounting to 40 odd Millions, which are supposed most counterfeited, are called in by the 1st June, & more money given in Exchange. I fear the plan will not sufficiently check the rapid depreciation which has lately taken place. The money has allmost ceased to be current in the Eastern States. Altho we have regularly the report of the day, yet there is very little of consequence to be depended on, tho I beleive it is certain the Enemys Shiping at N. York has suffered much by the late bad weather. It is said today, that there is a fleet of Merchantmen in the mouth of this River convoyed by a French line of battle Ship, & a Dutch M[an ofl War.  JANUARY 6, 1779  I have Letters for you from Doctr. Lee late in Septr.(4) They are Cypher, & will wait for you here, nothing new in Europe when these dispatches came away. If you have an opportunity to Mt. Airy before you leave home, shall be obliged if you will get from Mrs. Garrett, a sealed Packet I left in her care, and bring it up with you. It contains my loan office Certificates, Lottery Tickets, & some money.  Love to Chantilly & Stratford, Yours Affectly,  Francis Lightfoot Lee [P.S.] The report of the fleet in the River, not true.

  My dear Sir Jany 6-79 I wrote to you on the 3d Inst by Express and then promisd to write again by the first good Opportunity. The Bearer of this Letter is a young Gentleman of your Country passing thro this place in his Way home. He appears sensible, tells me he was educated at H. College, has since studied Physick, was taken at Sea & carried into JANUARY 6, 1779  England, was liberated or made his Escape & went over to France, from Paris he went to Dunkirk on the Encouragement of Mr. Dean & enterd Surgeon on board the Revenge Sloop, built by Order of a Come. of Congress authorizd thereto & at the Continental Expense, and till lately supposd to have ever since remaind Continental Property, but now so invelopd in political Commercial Mystery as that it cannot be ascertaind whether she is ownd by the United States or private Persons, or whether she is the property partly of publick & private. I will tell you more of this Matter when the Mystery shall be unraveld if it ever is; in the mean time remember my dear Sir what I said in my last of commercial Combinations.  In the latter End of 75 one of the Characters (1) in my last was left out of the Delegation of the Colony he had represented, and a Number of his Friends gave him a sort of Certificate or Letter of Recommendation, as they had before done to one of your Delegates,(2) which led me to think it was their Opinion he needed a Prop in his own Country. Soon after, the Congress appointed a secret Committee of Commerce, with a View of procuring from abroad the necessary Articles for carrying on the War. They also appointed a secret Committee of Correspondence. Their Business was to form political Connections abroad, & to feel the pulsations of foreign Powers and particularly France. The first of these Committees engaged Mr (3) to go to that Kingdom for the purpose of their Commission & the Corresponding Come. took the Advantage of his intended Residence there to facilitate the salutary Purpose of their Appointment. At the same Time they wrote a Letter to Mr-(4) then in England from whom the Congress had before receivd the most accurate Intelligence, requesting a Correspondence with him & pledging Secrecy & Confidence. Mr_ (5) arrvd in France in June 76. Thus you see we had an Intelligencer to let us know what was doing or meditating against us in England; and a political Commercial Agent who was to inform us what was doing or could be done for us in France. The one had before settled a Correspondence & formd Connections in several parts of the Continent of Europe & particularly France; the other was a perfect Stranger in every Nation in Europe, but bearing Letters to considerable Men there. The one was altogether the political Man, the other had to do with Commerce as well as politicks. The one by his Address obtaind in England such Assurances as satisfied him that France would afford such Aid to America as she could consistently, the other was better skilld in the commercial Part of his Agency than the political. The one in London in the Months of March and April discoverd that he might successfully & actually did treat with a Merchant in France of no Capital but a favorite at Court for a Supply to the Value of £200,000 sterling-the other arrivd in the Month of June following, found him out & was somehow concernd in forwarding the   Supplys thus contracted for. I dare say you are apt to draw this Conclusion that the one was the political Negotiator in this Instance & the other the Commercial Agent only-yet, will you believe it, it is positively affirmd that the one did every thing & the other Nothing. I will explain it to you in my next.  ""

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia Jany 6 1779 In your last you ask me, \""How Matters have stood since the Recall.\"" (1) I will answer this Question at another Time when I shall have more Leisure; and at present only say, that Mr D arrivd here, I think, in July and in August he was admitted into the House, or, to use his own Phrase, had an Audience, in which, with as much Vanity as I ever saw in a Man of Sense, he appeard to assume to himself almost the whole Merit of all the Services that had been renderd, at least by Americans in France; as if he would have it to be believd, that one of his Colleagues had done but little if any thing, the other worse than Nothing, himself every thing. And with equal Spleen & ill Nature, he would even go out of the Path of Decency and Propriety to draw in Invectives and diminish the Character of the two Mr Lees and Mr Izzard. In short his Publication which you have seen is a specimen of his Narrative. I have before given you my Opinion of that Performance; and shall not trouble you further upon that, any further than just to observe, that his insinuating that Mr W L remains still an Alderman of the City of London merely because his Name is inserted in that List in the Kallendar of 78, discovers something more than Childishness and Folly. His Design seems to be at once to prejudice the Reputation of that gentleman in the Minds of his Countrymen, and to hold up the Appearance of glaring Impropriety of Conduct in Congress, in appointing an Alderman of London an American Commissioner; and that this was done through the undue Influence of family Connection, for he take[s] particular Care to tell his Readers, that the two Brothers in Europe have two Brothers in Congress, which cannot be denied. Neither can it be denied, that they are a Family, who have been as early, as uniform, as persevering and perhaps as able American Patriots as any in the United States. Mr A JANUARY 6, 1779  L, you are fully sensible, was most indefatigable in supporting our Cause in England. By penetrating into the Designs of a most unprincipled Court, he was able to give us the most timely and important Intelligence, which he did at the Risque of his Life, while Mr____ (2) was in the opinion of some of his own Countrymen as well as others of a doubtful political Character. Mr. Lee continued to transmit to our Friends in France as well as to Congress, before he left England, the most accurate State of things there. Such was the Opinion entertained by Congress of his Abilities, his Integrity, and his Zeal and Attachment to his Country, which indeed had been long experienced, that he was employed as a most useful and necessary Man. The vigilant Eye of so consistent a Patriot may be formidable to a Combination of political and Commercial Men, who may be aiming to get the Trade, the Wealth, the Power and the Government of America into their own Hands. He must therefore be hunted down, and the young as well as the old Hounds are all ready for the Game.  Adieu. SA  ""

  [ante January 7, 1779] (1) The Honorable Robert Morris Esquire, late Chairman of the Secret and Commercial Committees, and thro' whose hands all the transactions of the former, and almost all of the latter had passed- did, in the Month of October 1777 inform Congress that he had obtained from his State leave of absence for six Months in order to settle and adjust his private Affairs, and he then moved the House for leave to take into his custody the Books of the Secret Committee, promising to adjust the Accounts contained in those Books in the course of a Month or two. The Books were accordingly put into Mr. Morris' hands, and transported from York to his House at Manheim. Some time in February 1778 Mr. Morris having been informed by a tale Bearer out of Congress, that his conduct had been freely descanted upon respecting those Books, threatened by Letter to return them,(2) unless the contrary should be particularly requested by Congress-no notice was taken of this menace. Mr. Morris continued nevertheless to hold the Books until near the middle of September 1778, when he informed Congress that he found the Books in such confusion he could make nothing of them, that he did not know he had any thing more to do with them than any body else, and that he should send them back to the committee-and he did so.  The 14th December 1778 Mr. Morris having been informed that the Books were lodged in the hands of Mr. Laurens, sent a message to Mr. Laurens desiring the Books might be returned to him, he was sure nobody but himself could settle them.

  Mr. President. January 7? 1779] (1) As the several Motions (2) on your Table appear to be founded upon the same Principle, I shall make some few Observations which relate to them all without balancing their respective Merits or taking Notice of the many Inaccuracies with which they abound. It gave me great Pain Sir to hear in the Debates both of Yesterday and this Morning JANUARY 7, 1779  the Word Party made Use of. This is a Word which can do no good but may produce much Evil. If there be a Party among us the Name is unnecessary. If there be not it is injust-And certainly there is not There is indeed in this House a chosen Band-of Patriots, who have a proper Respect for each others Opinions, A proper Sense of each other's Feelings and whose Bosoms glow with equal Ardor in the common Cause. But no Party. Gentlemen mean Nothing but the public Good tho sometimes they mistake their Object. But I would warn Gentlemen against indulging too far this Tenderness for each other. When one hath in View a favorite Object or hath adopted a favorite Opinion others hastily catch the Idea. The warm Effusion flies from Breast to Breast and Reason lags in the Pursuit. Hence arises a Prepossession which Reason combats in Vain. I hope for Indulgence whilst I state the Case before us as it really exists. I know that a Gentleman stands in a disagreeable Attitude whilst combating Principles which appear to flow from Regard to the Privileges of a Citizen and Respect for the Rights of Mankind. Yesterday we were told by an honorable Member, that these Rights and Privileges would be drawn into Question. He ventured to prophesy that they would and warned us to beware. On this Occasion the honorable Member was in Capacity to be an excellent Prophet. A very excellent Prophet, Mr. President. But I am not to be terrified by these Shadows. I trust I shall be able to shew that the Rights of a Citizen are nowise concerned in the Determination on the Matter before us. Gentlemen exclaim Do not deprive Mr. Payne of his Office without giving him a Copy of the Charge! Do not punish a Citizen unheard! I ask on what Tenure he holds that Office? Is it during good Behaviour? If it be he must be convicted of Malconduct before he can be removed. But we are not the proper Court to take Cognizance of such Causes. We have no criminal Jurisdiction. Clearly then he ought not to be heard before us. But he does not hold his Office during good Behavior it is during Pleasure that he holds it. And what are we? The Sovereign Power who appointed and who when he no longer pleases us may remove him. Nothing more is desired. We do not wish to punish him.(3) For how is he to be punished? It hath been said he is guilty of a Breach of his Oath of Office. Shall he be prosecuted for Perjury? Shall he be cropt? Sir we do not want his Ears. Shall we cause him to be whipt? Sir he hath already been so often whipped that it hath become habitual. Shall he be put in the Pilory or the Stocks and exposed to publick Shame? Sir it is a long Time since he hath set all Shame at Defiance.  What then do we ask? To turn a Man out of Office who ought never to have been in it. Let us examine the Circumstances. Mr. Payne Secretary to the Committee of foreign affairs stiling himself Secretary of foreign Affairs acknowleges himself to be the Author of a Publication highly dishonorable to his most Christian Majesty and very in  jurious to him and us. Dishonorable to the King of France because it is in direct Contradiction to repeated Assurances given to the british Court. Injurious to our mutual Interests because it enables the Ministers of Great Britain to charge France with a Breach of the Treaties and call upon other Courts for the Performance of Engagements entered into upon a View to that Contingency. Gentlemen who know Mr Payne may be unwilling to beleive this. It deserves Consideration. The Secretary of foreign Affairs is the Person who of all others must from the Nature of his Office be best acquainted with such Transactions. His Assertions therefore contain the fullest Weight which Knowledge can give. And not only so but from the Importance of that Office none but the most approved and exalted Character could be by a wise People intrusted to fill it. And therefore The Ideas annexed to such a Character will serve to authenticate his Assertions. Foreigners Sir have not an adequate Idea of the Manner in which Business is conducted in this House nor the Difficulties we have labored under. They are led therefore to compare every Thing on the Scale of their own Experience-And what would be the Idea of a Gentleman in Europe of this Mr. Payne. Would he not suppose him to be a Man of the most affluent Fortune born in this Country of a respectable Family with wide and great Connections and endued with the nicest Sense of Honor? Certainly he would suppose that all these Pledges of Fidelity were necessary to a People in our critical Circumstances. But alas, what would he think Should he accidentally be informed that this our Secretary of foreign Affairs was a meer Adventurer from England without Fortune, without Family or Connections ignorant even of Grammar?(4) and one who had tamely submitted to be kicked and cuffed from one End of America to the other. Could he beleive this? And if assured of the Fact, And if possessed only of common Sense, would he not think that we were devoid of it? And yet, Sir, this is the Man whom we would remove from Office And this is the Man who hath been just now puffed as of great Importance.  Considering the Case as it stands before us there are three Objects which require our Attention. The first is to obviate the ill Effects of his Publication. The second to remove him from Office. And the third to assign proper Reasons for that Conduct so as to connect the two first Propositions together and give a greater Weight to all our Measures.  In Order to obviate the ill Consequences of his mad Assertions we must pointedly contradict them. I say we must contradict them for to such a deplorable Situation hath this Man reduced us that altho many Gentlemen in the House might be of a different Opinion they Would find themselves urged by irresistible Motives of Policy to contradict his Assertions-Happily we have on our Table the fullest Evidence to ground a Declaration that what he hath published is untrue.  We must then proceed to assign our Reasons for removing him from his Office. These cannot be wanting. For in the first Place he never was fit for it and in the second Place he hath abused it in the Instance before us most flagrantly and therefore is utterly undeserving of any farther Confidence.  Lastly we must remove him for without this in contradicting him we shall not be beleived. Nor is this the worst of the Matter. The Presumption is that he would not have written these Things without our Consent and therefore a Disavowal of the Person becomes necessary not only to give Credit to a Disavowal of the Thing but to convince our Allies that we ourselves are not the Authors of this infamous Falsehood. And here Gentlemen step in and tell us of Mr. Payne's Importance. Sir were he really of Importance Nay more were his Assertions really true I should not hesitate a Moment to dismiss him from our Service. Duty to our Ally requires it. Duty to ourselves requires it. Look at his threatening Letter on your Table. What! are we reduced to such a Situation that our Servants shall abuse the Confidence reposed in them shall beard us with insolent Menaces and we shall fear to dismiss them without granting a Trial forsooth? And what are we to try? Has he not acknowledged himself to be the Author of those exceptionable Paragraphs? Are we not able to judge of them and to determine what they mean? Do we not know that they contain a Falsehood? Suppose Mr. Payne to be now standing at our Bar what would you do? Would you confess an Ignorance of Language and ask what those Paragraphs mean? Surely you would not. Would you ask him whether the Idea contained in them is true or false? It is utterly unnecessary. His Answer is ready \""That they are true.\"" But we know them to be false and we can hardly be so weak as to balance in our Judgment between Mr. Paine's Opinion and the full Evidence on our Table. What then remains unless it be to ask his Advice as to our Future Conduct. Sir He will tell us that he is Thomas Paine Author of all the Writings under the Signature of Common Sense, and Secretary of foreign Affairs, that he is a Man of infinite Importance far more entitled to our Respect than the most Christian King and that we must not dare to dismiss him from our Service because to his other Titles he adds that of a Citizen of Pensilvania-And should we take his Advice? And shall we be moved by his Threats? And shall we be amused by paltry Tales of this Creatures Importance? I hope not. I am confident we should not have wasted so much time and had so many Motions on this Subject but that some Gentlemen feel themselves interested in supporting-the Rights of a Citizen and but for that mutual Confidence and good Opinion and reciprocal Sentiment which is too apt to mislead those who are not constantly under the Guard of Reason.

  Philada Jany. 7th. 1779. I was not a little Surprized to find my Character attacked by a Publication in Mr Dunlaps paper of the 5th Inst. altho a little prepared to expect by a paragraph from the same Hand in the paper of the 31st Decr. last that something or other would be said to my Disadvantage.(1) The author of these writings Stiles his performance an address to the Public on Mr. Deanes affair-why the author quitted Mr. Deane to bring me on the Stage is immaterial and as I do not mean to enter the lists with him, I shall Content myself with stating simply the Facts he has alluded to. I do not Conceive that the State I live in, have any right or Inclination to enquire into, what Mercantile Connections I have had, or now have, with Mr Deane or with any other person whatever. If Mr. Deane had any Commerce that was inconsistant with his Public Station he must Answer for it. But As I did not by becoming a Delegate for the State of Pensylva., relinquish my right of forming Mercantile Connections, I was unquestionably at Liberty to form such with Mr. Deane. My now Giving the Account this Author desires, is not to gratify him, or resign the right I contend for, but purely to remove the force of his insinuation on that Subject and to do this effectually 1 will candidly relate all the Commercial Concerns I have had with Mr Deane.  The first was a Concern in a Brigt and Cargo fitted out by Mr Delap of Bourdeaux for this Country one third on his own Acct, one third on Mr. Deanes & the other third on W[illing] M[orris] & Co[mpany]s Acct. This Vessell was taken & Mr Delap charged Willing Morris & Co (whose Monies he had in hand) for their share.(2)  The second, was in a Valuable Ship & Cargo fitted for America by JANUARY 7, 1779  an Eminent Mercht in France who advanced the whole Money for W M & Cos share which amounted to Las 50,000. and has since been repaid with Interest by remittances made from this Country for the purpose. I always understood Mr. Deanes share to have been the same & Circumstanced in the like manner.(3)  The third & last Concern was as follows. I proposed to Mr Deane and some other Friends in Europe, to fit out a Privateer to Cruize on the British Trade.(4) To pay for my share I shipped 86 hhds Tobo. Onbd the Ship in which the intended Captain of the Privateer Went passenger to France. A french Gentn of Rank & Consequence in Paris adopted this plan & undertook to have it executed, but by the mismanagement & Villainy of some Agents he employed it was rendered abortive and the parties Concerned lost about £1000 Stg in charges & expences, what share Mr Deane held in this Adventure or whether any I really do not know.  These are all the Commercial Connections or Concerns I had with Mr Deane whilst he was in France and the two first took place whilst he acted as Commercial Agent.(5) Whether in Consequence of my good opinion of Mr Deane as a Man of honor & Integrity I have been led to form any & what new Concerns with him since his arrival here, is a Matter which the Public are no ways interested to know.  (I shall now to proceed to that part of the Publication wherein my Name appears) The express Charge against me in the Publication of the 5th Inst is in these Words. \""Hitherto our whole Anxiety has been absorbed in the means for Supporting our Independence and we have paid but little attention to the expenditure of Money, yet we see it daily depreciating and how should it be otherwise when so few public Accounts are settled and New Emissions continually going on. I will venture to mention one Circumstance which I hope will be sufficient to awaken the attention of the Public to this Subject. In October 1777 some Books of the Commercial Committee in which among other things were kept the Accounts of Mr. Thos. Morris, appointed a Commercial Agent in France, were by Mr. Robert Morris's request taken into his possession to be settled he having obtained from the Council of this State six Months leave of Absence from Congress to settle his affairs. In Feby following those Books were called for by Congress, but not being Compleated were not delivered. In Septr. 1778 Mr Morris returnd them to Congress in or nearly in the same unsettled State he took them, which, with the Death of Mr. Thos. Morris may probably Involve those Accounts in further embarrassment. The Amot. of the Expenditure on those Books is Considerably above two Millions of Dollars.\""  I shall now give the true state of these matters. My leave of Absence from Congress was obtained from the Supreme Executive Council at Lancaster the 11th Day of Novr. 1777 and bears that date; I returned  to Congress and on the 28th Novr. informed them of my leave of absence obtaind to Settle the affairs of the late House of Willing Morris & Compy as well as my own & as some leisure time might Occur I offered in full Congress to take with me the Books of the secret Committee which were then unemployd. The Offer was accepted by general Consent, tho no resolution was entered, it being unnecessary. The day I left Congress 1 was appointed on a Committee to repair to Head Quarters from whence I did not return to Manheim untill the 15 Decr. at which time the Books were not arrived nor did they reach me untill the latter end of that Month.  In the beginning of Feby 1778 I was informed that some matters to my prejudice had been insinuated by a Member in Congress respecting these Books whereupon I wrote a letter dated the 8th that month to the Commercial Committee who then had the Direction of them complaining of the injury and offering to return them and received an Answer dated the 21st, containing the following Clause \""We laid this letter (meaning mine) before Congress who desired us to inform you that they wou'd have you still keep the Books in your possession and settle them as soon as you could.\"" Accordingly I retained them & untill they were redilivered employd on them the little leizure which remained from my private avocations & the many interruptions occasioned by public business which pursued me in my retirement & many times obliged me to Visit York Town each visit taking up from four to six days. In the beginning of June I went to Camp at Valley Forge & remained there untill the evacuation of this City, after a Weeks stay here I returned to Manheim to bring down my Family & Effects. I was again in Philada the 4th day of July the Anniversary of our Glorious Independance & in the course of a Week or Ten days my Effects & with them the Books in Question came down and remained unopened untill I delivered them to the Clerk of the Commercial Committee which I think was in that Month July. Thus it appears that instead of having these Books to Work in, from Octr 1777 to Septr 1778, it was in my power to do so only from the latter end of Decr. to the first of June; And instead of returning them in the same or nearly the same unsettled State they were received, these Books will shew that I Settled a Number of Accounts the Entries being made with my own hand in the Waste Book. They were afterwards Journalized & Posted by my Clerks, untill the Ledger was so full that there was not room to open any More Accounts in it. I sent to Lancaster to procure paper of the same Size to be sewed into that Book that I might go on but none suitable for the purpose could be obtained & I was obliged to shut these Books at that time. Mr. T. Ms. papers were Seized on his Death in France by the Kings Officers according to the Custom in that Country they were afterwards delivered to & kept by the American Commissioners untill orders shoud appear from America. I applyed   to Congress for an order to have them delivered to my Agent; tho' at that time ignorant of the State of his Accts. I pledged myself to Congress tho' no ways bound to do so, that I would pay any balance that might be due, from him to the Public. These Books & Papers I have not yet recd. nor do I know whether the order for them has reached my agent's Hands but the House at Nantz who under his Direction transacted all the commercial business of Mr. T. Morris have rendered clear Accounts of those Concerns to the Commercial Committee. His Accounts have, since I delivered up the Books, been rendered by the House that transacted the Public business under his Superintendance. There is no embarrassment in them that I know of and instead of his being a Debtor the Balance is in favour of that House Las. 50380.2.9 or about £ Sterlg which they stopped from Monies of W. M. & Cos in their hands & have empowered me to receive the same from Congress.  By this manner of mentioning that, the Amount of Expenditures on the Committee's Book is considerably above Two Millions of Dollars, some People may be led to immagine that I stand Accountable for that Sum. The Fact is thus. The Books are Kept by double Entry and the Treasury having Credit for all the Monies drawn from it, by the Committee, those who received are charged & Accountable for what they did receive, many Gentn from New Hampshire to Georgia entered into Contracts on which they recd parts of this Money for which they have accounted or are to Account and in the like manner is my late House or myself to Acct for all Monies by them or me received. Twice I have settled W. M. & Cos Accounts with the Secret Committee and the Entries thereof are in their Books the last was closed in May 1778 a balance being thus due to my House. There are it is true many Articles yet to be Settled. I have made out In best State of them in my power and wou'd gladly make a final Settlement if possible, that cannot now be done because some Accts Sales & Accts Currant are not yet received from Europe and many Articles of Goods which are finally to be Articles of these Accounts have been by inevitable Accidents lodged in the West Indias & must be carried to Account in different ways on the Contingency of their safe arrival within the United States. On the best Computation I can make of all the depending Accounts my late House & myself have with the Continent the latter are considerably indebted, and I shall either make a Speedy Settlement or if Circumstances continue to put that out of my power I will lay before Congress a full State & Estimate of these dependancies when I doubt not they will do ample [. . .] Justice to my Character.  As my determination is not to enter into any Controversy with the Author that has made this unprovoked & unmerited attack I do not think it worth while to take any other Notice of his remarks referred  to in the Publication respecting the Government of Pensylvania, than to agree that whenever I aim at the Government or at handling the Public Money, these remarks shall have the full force he intends on my reputation. Out of respect to that Public with which I wish to stand as fair as my real Conduct & Character deserves so far have I been from protracting the Settlement of Public Accounts that I have on all occasions promoted such Settlements and all measures that tended thereto. In Novr 1777 before I left Congress at York Town I drew up a report from the Commercial Committee for Establishing a Board of Commissioners to manage the Public Commerce & settle the Accounts, urging that it was Impossible for Members of Congress if ever so well acquainted with business to do that duty & attend in Congress, this I urged frequently & the report being opposed by some still lies undetermined on in Congress. After joining Congress in Philada I moved that the Old Members of the Secret Committee as most Competent might be reappointed a Committee to finish the Settlement of their Accounts which was agreed, but those members being much engaged one of them that did attend I hired a good accomptant to Work at those Accounts which he did untill discharged by a Member of the New appointed Commercial Committee who I understand have undertaken to finish the Settlement of these Accounts himself. I will only add, that it is in my power to prove by papers in my possession, papers & records in the Public offices or by living Witnesses of unquestionable Character every Circumstance & Fact that I have laid before the Public.(6) R M  [P.S.] Mr. Robert Morris of Philada. presents his Compts to such Printers as may re-Publish the papers Stiled, Common Sense to the Public on Mr. Deanes affairs-and Request's they will republish therewith this address to the Public and he will chearfully pay their drafts on him for the charge of printing.

Was you to see me this night, in the scituation I am, with a beard a week old, with the cape of my great Coat buttoned about my ears, & a large muffler of Baize across my nose & mouth, I am sure you would not give me a kiss; & that would be ten times worse than the pain I now feel, & have felt for (ten) days past. In short such a fare I never had before & hope never shall again. How I came by it I know not, nor do I care, so that I get rid of it again, which I think I shall in two or three days more. And you will expect I suppose that [the] moment I am able to ride I set off, post haste for home; but, my dear, I cannot come [. . .] will give you no reasons why because [you wi]ll believe none; only that I cannot come & must do without [....] I will tell you more for your amusement, & that is how I kept Christmas. I went among the papists & atended divine service in a romish chappel where I confess I was wonderfully struck with the shew of the place, the superstition of the ceremonies & devotion of the people. I did not arive in season to smell the burning of frankinsense, nor to see our saviour carryed about in a cradle under pretense of his having been born the very night before; but I saw him extended at full length upon the cross, seven golden candlesticks burning upon an Alter before him, & one in the midst with a candle as large as a man's Arm. At this alter stood their priest covered with a mantle bespangled with [. . .] & two boys, in white, to hold up the [. . .] it, & occasionally to ring a little [. . .] held in thier hands. The Alley leading [. . .] the Image of our saviour [. . .] men & women on their knees [chan]ting prayers out of lattin books [. . .] understood not a word of, & those who had no book had strings of beads in their hands, which they counted over & answered the same purpose. The priest administered the sacrement to a number, but I observed after he had put a small wafer into their mouths, he drank all the wine himself & when his Glass was out one of his boys stepd up & filled her again, & so on until the cruize gave out when the kneelers arose & that priest [. . .] & diping in their fingers & crossing themselves the service was finished, & I returned home to a dinner which gave me more substantial entertainment-thus ended Christmas & thus ends my Letter.

  Sir, Philadelphia Jany 10th, 1779. Some time ago the Congress resolved to appoint two Brigadiers for our State, and agreeable to instructions we nominated Colos Sumner and Clark. Yesterday Col. Sumner and Hogan were sworn by ballot. The choice of the latter gentleman not being pursuant to the Instructions, the design of this letter is to account for it, and, if you please, you may lay it before the Assembly.(1)  After the nomination of Cols Sumner & Clark Mr Hill and myself who lodge together, were informed by a gentleman, who came immediately through the army, that the deviation from the line of Seniority of rank, in the intended promotion of Col Clark, gave great uneasiness, that it was considered by Officers of every Corps, as a violence to Military rank and honor, and by all resented. Reflecting that this matter of Military rank had given great uneasiness, and occasioned great embarrassment to Congress, and that it had been for some time settled, and no deviation made from it, except where some officers had been fortunately distinguished in some extraordinary enterprise, (a case which is always admitted as an exception to the general rule) and that it would not be prudent or just to wound a set of men, in a point which they hold so tender, who are so useful to their Country, and have ventured and suffered so much for their fellow Citizens, with no prospect of emolument peculiar to them and reflecting also that the officers of our own Troops must be reduced to the necessity of resigning, or remaining in the Army as men degraded, and of course despised-a Situation the most intolerable that I can imagine and in which, I am persuaded, as they do not deserve to be placed to their Country do not wish them to be, reflecting I say Sir, on these circumstances, Mr Hill and myself concluded, that it would be for the general good that the promotion should take place according to the rank of our line, and that the State, if well informed would, so far, countermand their Instructions. Being however, concluded by our Instructions, we would not presume to nominate or vote for any but such as we had in command.  JANUARY 10, 1779  We deemed it however, incumbent on us, in order to preserve that character, for candor and integrity which we very highly value, and which we deem necessary even for preserving a due weight to the representation of the State, and particularly in order to prevent on the State the imputations of partial injustice and of involving the Congress in difficulties with respect to the Army. We deemed it incumbent on us to inform the Congress before they proceeded to ballot, how the rank of our line stood, and what occasioned the Instruction. We communicated our Ideas to Mr Penn, and he concurred with us. Accordingly Sir, I laid the matter fairly before Congress, and immediately thereon Col. Hogan was put in nomination, but not by any of us. Mr. Penn endeavoured to support the nomination made under our Instructions, which, I confess, I did not. I told Congress that were I to make a choice from my present Instructions it should be Col. Clark. But I thought all such considerations should give place to public utility, that I was apprehensive the choice of him would induce a very great inconvenience in our present circumstances, and I ventured to give it as my opinion that the state would not desire any thing which might have such effect. I lamented the misfortune of Col. Clark, in having been restrained by superior command at Germantown which prevented his having an opportunity of obtaining distinction, that even this misfortune had given a preference to Col. Hogan who had in that action behaved with distinguished intrepidity, that upon the whole, tho' I must vote for Col. Clark, because I was so instructed, I could not be so uncandid as to say he had the best pretensions. In all the sentiments I delivered, I was happy to find Mr Hill concurred with me; nor indeed do I know that Mr Penn differed. He chiefly insisted on his instructions, and the violence done to Col. Clarks feelings, in refusing him a promotion, which had been so long expected for him.  Mr Hill and I, for whom only I can now speak, not having seen Mr Penn since the adjournment, are persuaded that we have done what our constituents would have done if present, but should we be so unhappy as to have our conduct disapproved, we must lament the dilemma in which we were placed, and which made it impossible for us to gratify ourselves by supporting our Instructions, and at the same time preserve a due regard for the public service, and for the character of upright Integrity, which is very dear to every honest man, and essentially necessary to every magistrate among free people.  I have the honor to be Sir, your very Ob. Servt. Thos Burke  ""

  Sir. January 10? 1779. (1) An unnecessary allusion in your Address to the Public Saturday the 9th Inst. has dragged me to the Press, an ill chosen tribunal for the purpose of Liquidating old Accounts.  You say-\""Early in the Month of February 1778, you were informed that some matters to your prejudice had been insinuated by a Member in Congress respecting these Books,\"" referring to the Books of the Secret Committee.  Every Member of Congress understands what is meant by your insinuation, they know the particular Member whom you mean to mark, altho there were many others who expressed the same sentiments, every enquirer out of Doors will soon be informed who is the person-hence it is become necessary for me to ward off & to remove prejudices against myself. In the instance you allude to I insinuated nothing. I asserted certain facts respecting the Books which cannot be denied, & one other fact which if proved, must affect your reputation. Upon what grounds did I assert the latter? not vague report, but upon the testimony of a Member of Congress,(2) one of your Coadjutors in the Commercial Committee, who was present in Congress then sitting in York Town & to whom I appealed for confirmation, He was silent but did not contradict. I was not actuated by a desire to destroy your Character: quite the contrary, the information which I gave was ushered by sentiments like the following & as well as I can remember in almost the same words-\""if the account which I have received be true, the Public ought to be informed, if it be groundless, Justice forbids that Mr. Morris should be kept in ignorance.\"" The Gentleman from whom I had received the information & to whom at the same time I declared I would introduce it into Congress upon the first proper occasion, called upon me in the Evening after the Adjournment of Congress & said \""he was very sorry I had men- JANUARY 10, 1779  tioned that affair\""-why so Sir? You know I told you I would not keep it secret; because replied the Gentleman I had determined to take an opportunity of speaking to Mr. Morris myself-be the affair well or ill grounded, I have not acted unfairly.  A few days after this occurrence, a common friend of yours and mine (3) who had recently returned from Manheim suggested to me that you had been extremely misinformed respecting what had passed in Congress on the subject abovementioned & that you were Hellish Mad. He expressed himself altogether in terms of benevolence, his attempts aimed at one point, to conciliate-he earnestly requested me to write & explain the matter to you. I resisted his kind entreaties because in a compliance there would have been a manifest impropriety. If Mr. Morris has been taught to believe I have injured him, he will undoubtedly call on me, it would be beginning at the wrong end were I to offer a justification before I am accused & I am persuaded Mr. Morris if he is innocent will not silently bear the charge which has been brought against him-why you have not made an inquiry into that charge is not for me to answer.  Before I came to Congress I had heard complaints of the great expenditures of Money by the secret Committee in which you had been always viewed as the ostensible Actor & of the unsettled state of their accounts. Similar Complaints were repeated in my Ears immediately upon my appearance in Congress in July 1777, & although, \""Audiam alteram partem,\"" (4) is a never failing maxim with me, jealousies were unavoidably excited, the information given by the Member at York Town had no tendency to extinguish or lessen them-had you called upon or written to me I would have given you the fullest satisfaction in my power-to do justice to an injured Man without respect to his rank or fortune is one of the highest pleasures I experience in life.  Neither Common Sense (5) nor your self Sir, have accurately represented the Case respecting your assumption & surrender of the Books. I will therefore supply the defect of both relations, by the following brief & true state.  You proposed to Congress as you say in November 1777 to take the Books to Manheim & to attempt in your recess an adjustment of the Accounts of the Secret Committee. I think you said you hoped to accomplish the business in about two Months-in the Month of February following Congress discovered much dissatisfaction at your long detention of those Books & upon that occasion I said, \""from my Ideas of the Secret Committee's accounts I would engage to post up the whole in nine days, admitting Entries had been regularly made in the Waste Book-that if the necessary Entries had not been made an imputation would fall upon some body or other for the neglect. The Books however remaind in your hands, not I assure you Sir from any   special desire of Congress, they were chagrined and came to no decision on your Letter of the 8th Febry. the Commercial Committee were desired to write such an answer as they should judge proper.  In September 1778-you informed Congress then sitting in Philadelphia, \""that you had done all you could in the Books of the Secret Committee but that they were in such confusion you could make nothing of them, that therefore you wished to be rid of them & would send them to the Commercial Committee or wherever Congress should be pleased to direct, that you did not know you had any more to do with them than any body else.\"" Those Books were accordingly sent by you as I have understood to the Commercial Committee & from thence the Committee sent them to my House early in December last.(6) A few days after they had been in my possession a Young Gentleman called upon me in your Name requesting the Books should be returned to you because you were sure no body could settle them but your self or by him with your assistance. You will not think it extraordinary that I was surprised at the tenor of this Message. I replied to the Gentleman, the Books Sir had been very long in Mr. Morris's hands, he assured Congress some time ago that he could make nothing of them-they are now in mine, I am determined to make an essay on them, besides it would be extremely improper to put Public Books into the hands of any Gentleman who is not a Member of Congress. My Compliments to Mr. Morris, if I find it necessary to ask his advice or assistance I shall take the Liberty of applying to him. This I say Sir is a brief & true state of facts relative to the Books of the Secret Committee from November 1777 to December 1778.  You have, in my opinion, from many circumstances made your self responsible for the transactions in general of the Secret Committee, as well as for all deficiencies which may appear in the Accounts of your late Brother Mr. Thomas Morris from a certain period.  If I am not unexpectedly called away from Congress I trust I shall with the consent of the present Committees be able to shew what the Books do really contain and in what manner the Public Money has been expended; far be it from me Sir, in the present stage to assert or insinuate that you have in any respect acted dishonestly. I hope quite the contrary will appear-but viewing you as an accomptant through whose hands all the business of the Secret Committee had passed & in whose single name much of that business had been negotiated I must think you a little faulty for keeping the Books upwards of ten Months & then returning them in their present disorderly state-especially as they had been a long time in your custody antecedent to November 1777.  You plead in excuse many other avocations, but will this considera-   tion excuse you before the Public-by no means. Why did you engage in so much more business than you were competent to? If private affairs would not admit of a close attention to your Public duties for the due execution of which in the particular case before us Congress had altogether depended upon you you should have relinquished in time & delivered up the Books in good order.  I speak with equal freedom & candor but I do not mean to draw too hasty conclusions to your detriment. If after a full examination of the Books there shall appear no fault on your part I shall be among the foremost to \""do justice to your Character\"" & to remove every groundless suspicion from the minds of others by declaring in public & in private that you have not meritted censure. I shall be happier if I am enabled to add that you deserve the thanks of your fellow Citizens.  I am Sir your obedient humble Servant,  The Member alluded to.  ""

  11 January 1779.(1) Some time in the Course of last Winter while Congress was sitting at York Town, Mr. Laurens being in conversation in the, Congress Room with the Honble. Francis Lewis Esquire on the subject of the secret Committee's Books & accounts & the public Commercial affairs in general, Mr. Lewis intimated that there had in several Instances, been sad doings, some of which he mentioned generally, one Instance Mr Lewis particularized nearly in the following terms.  I'll tell you one extraordinary affair, there was a large Ship Loaden with Tobacco (I think he said about 470 Hogsheads) the Bills of Loading for that Cargo were filled up Consignd to the order of either Willing & Morris or Willing Morris & Co I cannot be certain which. Mr. Morris was asked how the property of the Cargo would appear, he replied, that would appear at a proper time, or words to that effect. The Vessel was taken by the Enemy as she was going out-after which it appeared that there was only I think eleven Hogshds but in a subsequent conversation Mr Laurens said, (if I remember right) 23 or 27 Hogsheads on private account & all the rest on public. Mr. Laurens replied, Good God Sir is it possible? I am glad you have not enjoined me to secrecy, if you had I believe I should have mentioned this circumstance for it ought not to be kept Secret. Justice to the Public as well as to Mr Morris requires it should not-or words of the same meaning & import.  Mr Lewis & Mr Laurens continued in conversation on the same topic in which Mr Lewis heightned Mr Laurens' suspicions by fre- JANUARY 11, 1779  quent repetitions that the Commercial affairs had been sadly conducted. Some days after the conversation abovementioned, the Books of the Secret Committee being a subject of debate in Congress, Mr Laurens (being then President), begged leave to be heard-he expressed his astonishment at the long detention of those Books, which were then in the hands of the Honorable Robt Morris Esquire at Manheim & were wanted or said to be wanted by the Commercial Committee, he said that according to his Ideas of the nature of those Books admitting the Entries had been properly made in the Waste Book he would undertake to Post up the whole in nine days or would forfeit two of his fingers, he added that he wished for the adjustment of the Books & their return the more earnestly because of a circumstance which had come to his knowledge & then briefly related, what he had heard from Mr Lewis, as abovementioned. Mr Lewis was then standing in a Window at the left of & nearly touching the President's Chair-Mr. Laurens turning himself to Mr Lewis added pointing with his left hand, & I have now in my Eye the honorable Gentleman from whom I received the information.  Mr. Lewis, after the adjournment of Congress, called on Mr. Laurens & said I am very sorry you mention'd that affair in Congress -why so Sir? said Mr Laurens, you know I told you I would mention it at the first proper opportunity. Justice to all parties required that I should do so. Mr Lewis answer'd, because I had intended to mention it to Mr Morris himself the first proper opportunity.  The above writing contains substantially the truth of every article & matter therein referred to. I do not presume to aver the several conversations are related verbatim.(2)  ""

  Sir Philada. Jany. 11th, 1779.  I am to acknowledge the Honour of Your Communication of this Morning.(1) I shall say nothing as to the Propriety of Vindicating yourself in the News paper, nor pretend to determine whether there is or is not a better Method.  JANUARY 11, 1779  Your own feelings must prompt and your own judgement direct you. For myself I am indifferent what attacks may be made on me. I feel a consciousness of innocence which puts me above every Effort to cast a stain on what, I thank God, hath hitherto been an unblemished reputation. Since you have enclosed that paper to me I am under the necessity of pointing out some of those instances in which from inadvertancy you have mistated Facts lest a silent Acquiescense shou'd be misconstrued into admission.  You will observe that I have not chosen the Press as a Tribunal for the liquidation of Accounts but being charged Publickly by Name, I was under a Necessity of defending myself in my own Name publickly. \""The one other Fact, you allude to-which if proved must affect my reputation\"" or rather one other allegation, I never heard untill last Saturday Evening when a Gentleman informed me what passed in Congress on the Subject. I have here to add that no circumstances could have given me greater pleasure than to learn that matters which had so long been the groundwork of private Conversation against me, were now to be publickly investigated and I will add, Publickly refuted.  I am little solicitous who gave you the information, but am to thank you for the Public communication, and confess my astonishment that the similar declaration at York Town, if such was made, was not followed by an immediate investigation for I agree with you that if it be true the Public ought to be informed, and I go farther. the offender ought to be punished. Why I have not made an enquiry into that charge is already answered for I could not enquire after things I had not heard and never shou'd expect to be charged with.  The reason why I did not call on you was that from my information, you had only drawn wrong conclusions from mistated Facts, and thence taken an opportunity to urge insinuations to my disadvantage, to which a justification of myself before Members of Congress was unnecessary, and their cordial and unabated Friendship to me convinced me I had done what was right on that occasion.  You are mistaken if you suppose I said that I hoped to accomplish the Settlement of the Books in question in about two Months. I did not say so.  I agree that you or I or any person that understands Book-Keeping might soon post up the Books had the Entries been regularly made in the waste Book. They were not, but minutes of the Committee were regularly Kept, from which and the letters and Accounts in their possession, those Entries can be made. This is the State of that matter & this I Stated to Congress while you was in the Chair and Moved a resolution that the Members of that Committee should be directed to finish the Settlement of those Accounts,(2) and when the Honourable  R. H. Lee Esqr. declined this task then I asserted that I had no more business to settle the Books than (not any body else, but [)] any Member of that Committee. If there was no decision in Congress on my letter of the 8th Feby., Mr. Lewis & Mr. Ellery must justify themselves for signing and Sending me the answer I have published.(3) I cannot suppose they wou'd have done it without proper Authority therefore am inclined to think they can set you right in that respect. You have much misapprehended what passed in Congress in Septr. 1778. 1 informed Congress that I had Worked at the Books of the Secret Committee untill the Ledger was filled so that there was no room for opening new Accounts and that I had delivered the Books to the Clerk of the Commercial Committee. So far from saying, \""that I had done all I could in the Books\"" (except on acct. of the Ledger) \""and that they were in such Confusion I could make nothing of them and therefore wished to be rid of them.\"" I deny the Fact. I never entertained such Sentiments and declared quite the reverse. I said the Accounts were in such forwardness that they might easily be settled by the Members of the Secret Committee & therefore moved they might be appointed for that service, this Sir will be well Remembered by many Members of Congress. What Conversation passed between You & the Young Gentleman who called for the Books I really do not know. I authorized no such conversation on my part as you mentioned. That Young Gentn. when he recovered from Sickness went to the office to work at the Books, not finding 'em there he came to me. I knew nothing of them, but Mr. Brown informed him you had them, as I did not know your intentions, I told him I supposed you wou'd give them to him when you had done with them.  With respect to the reasoning of your Piece I shall at present be Silent, if you are convinced of the justness of it you will abide by it, my own opinions govern me, and as you & I differ I will only tell you at this time, that I beleive your strictest search after deficiencies in the Committees or my Brothers Accounts will not answer your expectations, but if any such appear I will chearfully abide the Consequences shou'd Congress determine me to be answerable. When I have received that acquittal which I am confident of and placed in that light which I know myself to deserve, it will be time enough to speak of private Friendships. I have a better opinion of you than to believe you would prostitute that term by a Connexion with me whom you seem to consider as a dishonest Man.(4)  I am Sir with proper respect, Your most Obedt. & humble Servant, Robt. Morris  P.S. I return your piece herewith.  ""

  Sir, Philada. January 12 1779 I presume the Object of your letter (1) handed to me in Congress today is to obtain a knowledge of the Resources of the State I represent in the Article of Bread. Respecting other States their delegates are more competent, and respecting Virginia in particular a Delegate from her who is one of your Committee (2) is much better able to inform You. The Country I live in produces great abundance of Indian Corn and Wheat. On the Great River the Crop of the former has been very much injured by Freshes; but enough yet remains for their own consumption, and to fatten a great deal of Pork, but far short of the usual quantity. The Western part of the State including a Tract of near two hundred Miles square, and containing near twenty Thousand fighting men, produces great quantities of excellent Wheat and the last Harvest was very plentiful tho' not quite so much had been sowed as usual. Except the Militia which has been embodied for the Southern Expedition I know of no particular consumption of this commodity. The quality I suppose may be somewhat injured by the Wevil; but I am persuaded there is much of it still to spare. The Mills have been much damaged by Freshes and Teames are become very scarce: These circumstances may make the transportation and manufacturing difficult, but I believe the desire of gain will surmount all. The stock in that Country are always fed on Indian Corn of which there have been very plentiful Crops the last Year.  The Person of the Commissary department has spread among the People, they have been taught to believe that bread is very scarce every where else; and that the Demand for it will be much greater than ever. The Country I am now speaking of is remote from Navigation; but I believe a considerable quantity of Flour might be contracted for at Cross-creek, or Wilmington on Cape-Fear River, which has a good Navigation.

  Dr. Sir, Philadelphia Jany. 12th, 1779. I make no doubt but your Excellency will think me short in my Duty, for not having before this, addressed you by Letter, since my Arrival at this place, but from your usual good Nature, hope you'll pass it by, as not proceeding from Disrespect, but rather from a wish to have it in my power to communicate something worthy your Attention, and indeed, am still unable to afford any Intelligence extraordinary. There has been a grand Maneuvre in Congress, attempting to fund their several paper Emissions, but am doubtful this project will be very injurious to the Southern States, my wish is, that I may be mistaken; however think, this might be remedied in some degree, should our State emit a Sum of paper Cury. immediatelv & buy up all the Continental Cury possible, and lodge it in the Loan Office, in which case, they would draw on Interest for all Sums over their proportion, and would have it in their power to procure Contl.  JANUARY 12, 1779  Cury. without any Inconvenience; which in a future day must be redeemed with Gold & Silver or its equivalent. Am sensible how averse our people are to emitting money, but when it is considered that the quantity of circulating medium is not increased by this Emission, and only one Species of Money exchanged for another, am led to beleive under this Consideration they will consent to emit such a Sum as they may judge necessary to exchange for Contl. Cury. This being a matter of real Moment to us, wish the Assembly to prosecute some Scheme that will avert the Danger.  I must not omit informing you that Col. Clarke has not been promoted agreeable to Instructions given the Delegates by the Assembly. This matter expect will occasion some warmth among Colo. Clarkes Connections (whom I much esteem) and perhaps the Assembly may construe it, into a Violation of the Trust reposed in their Delegates-therefore think it necessary to state the matter as it really was. A few Days past Cols. Sumner & Clarke were nominated to be ballotted for Brigd. for our State, yesterday their Election came on, when Mr Burke & myself impressed with a Sense of the Duty we owe to the common Cause, and justly alarmed with the intended Resignations of many of our Officers, concluded that we should not be acting the part of candid & honest Men, not to remind Congress of our Instructions relative to this matter, and at the same time inform them of the Rank of our Line, and leave it with them to determine the Merits of the several Officers was not the question, but Seniority determined Congress in favor of Col. Hogan; on our front we implicitly obeyed our Instructions, by nominating and voting for Col. Clarke, this was all we had it in our power to effect, and we rest assured from this State of the matter, we shall stand acquitted by our Country, as we are sensible they would wish us to retain that degree of Candor and Integrity, which ever distinguishes the worthy Character.

  [January 14, 1779] (1) In a Teat a Teat conversation with the Honble Mr Laurens at York Town, introduced by Mr Laurens's observations on the confused state of our commercial transactions, and hinting at some vessels employed in the public Service carrying goods on the private Account of some members of that Committee, which had been communicated to him by his friends from Charles Town.  This led me to relate the following circumstances as a matter, that Struck me at the time of its transaction.  Congress at Baltimore, having occasion to send Dispatches immediately to France, were informed that a Ship laden with Tobacco was then in the harbour ready to sail. The Commercial Committee was requested to ask the Captain if he would take the charge of said packet, and that upon his arrival at a port in France, he would deliver the same into the hands of one of the Commissioners at Paris. To this he objected, saying he could not justify himself to his owners, in leaving the Ship to proceed with the packet to Paris. He was then asked if the ship was not laden on the Continental Account. To which he replyed; That she was chartered by Messrs Willing & Morris's clerk, and that the bills of lading which the said Captain signed, were filled up, Shipped by Willing dr Morris, Concluding therefore that the Cargo was not on Account of the public.

6596,dg011470,1779,Henry Laurens to Congress,"""Henry Laurens to Congress
  Mr. President Saturday 16th January 1779 I have perused the honorable Mr. Lewis' Paper delivered and read at the Table on the 14th Instant (1) in consequence of a request made to him the 11th by Congress that he would inform the House of all he knew of a certain Tobacco Ship and other matters alluded to in a Paper, which in compliance with a Similar request to me on the 9th I delivered in on the 11th.(2)  This honorable House I trust will not have forgotten how repeatedly before I committed, what I had been requested to commit, to writing, I entreated Mr. Lewis to retire with me into the LibraryRoom in order to assist my memory if I had in any respect mis-stated verbally our conversations at York Town-and how immovable he remained in his Chair.  I will not contend with the honorable Gentleman on the question which of us introduced the conversation? It appears to be totally immaterial, but I do aver he is wrong in his assertion that I \""hinted\"" at \""communications made to me by my friends in Charlestown.\"" I do not recollect that ever I received, and I am morally certain I never did receive any communication from Persons in Charlestown \""of vessels employed in the public service\"" carrying goods on the private account of some Members of the Secret or Commercial Committee. I not only \""hinted,\"" but fully expressed that I had heard complaints of such transactions from Members of Congress. I asked Mr. Lewis how the freight of such private property could be ascertained? if it was consistent with the Public interest to equip and arm Ships for the exportation or importation of private property? what freight would compensate? and added, \""these appear to me to be very irregular proceedings\""; in which Mr. Lewis perfectly acquiesced.  I remember nothing of the matter respecting the Committee's application to the Captain of the Ship to take charge of a Packet for the Commissioners at Paris, but I will not set up the deficiency of my memory in opposition to Mr. Lewis' assertion. I will therefore admit this preface to have introduced his part of the conversation.  Mr. Lewis acknowledges the Captain replied to the Committee at Baltimore that \""his Ship was chartered by Messrs. Willing and Morris' Clerk, and that the Bills of Loading were filled up shipped by Willing and Morris,\"" and he does not deny that he informed me the consignment was to \""the Order of Willing and Morris, or Willing, Morris and Co.\"" nor can this be denied, the Bills of Loading substantially establish the fact and more, inasmuch as the \""Account and risque\"" were to be \""as per Advice,\"" which in Commercial language is synonymous with the order of the Shipper.  JANUARY 16, 1779  Mr. Lewis after deliberating from Saturday the 9th to Thursday the 14th Instant has not denied the several allegations contained in my Paper, nor can he without first eradicating truth and honor from his Breast, which I am persuaded he is incapable of, deny one of them in substance. It has nevertheless been said, not by Mr. Lewis, that it was a little unfortunate, \""that Gentlemen who were then in Congress did not remember the circumstance clearly,\"" some have acknowledged that they remembred \""something about it\"" and that there were some insinuations made by me.  Gentlemen who were last Winter in Congress, the whole number scarcely ever amounting to seventeen, some of whom are now absent, will call to mind that Congress during the last Winter, were constantly engaged in businesses of the highest moment, and which required immediate dispatch, that they were in many instances obliged to execute their own Resolves, and will admit a possibility therefore, that every Member, Mr. Lewis and myself excepted, may have forgotten the affair of the Tobacco Ship as related by me, more especially as it was not quite a new subject when I gave the relation-I had heard somewhat of it antecedently to Mr. Lewis' Account, but only as a matter of suspicion and surmise, and had treated it accordingly. I had no avidity for blasting the reputation of any Gentleman upon a foundation of mere whisper-besides every Gentleman's observation will convince him that 'tis not uncommon for Members of a Public Assembly in which there is much debate on variety of subjects to lose totally the remembrance of what had been said at a distance of near twelve Months by an individual and not matured into a vote and record.  I beg leave to support this remark by two very recent instances. A Gentleman on the South side of the House some five or six days ago in the course of debate strongly alluded to a certain brilliant Present, another Gentleman situated on the opposite point warmly animadverted on the first Gentleman's wit. Who was in the right or who in the wrong, is not my part to determine-but within an hour of the adjournment I asked two Members who are generally very attentive to every discussion on this floor, their sentiments on that part of the Morning's conversation-each declared \""he did not remember a word about it,\"" altho' the subject had been box'd from North to South.  On the 11th Instant a motion was made by an honorable Gentleman that Mr. Lewis should inform the House of every thing he knew respecting the Tobacco Ship upon Oath-this very Morning I applied to a group of five Members for the name of the Honorable mover; two or three of these Gentlemen did not even recollect the circumstance, none of them could remember who was the Man till I had assisted them-but to return to the business.  I have read the Charter Party for the ship in question now named by the extracts which Mr. Lewis has produced-the \""Farmer, Capt. Dashiel.\""  The contracting parties are Archibald Buchanan of Baltimore, and Willing, Morris and Company by John Brown their Agent- neither the United States nor Congress nor any power for, acting under, or for and on behalf of Congress is or are expressed or implied in any part of the Charter-and it is remarkable that in the six first instances of eight, where the names of Willing, Morris and Company are inserted in this Charter, the words-and Company are carefully interlined, as if intended to include and comprehend the Person or Persons, associates and Copartners of Willing and Morris as parties in the Covenant mutually interrested with Willing and Morris in all the risques and benefits of intended voyage.  I have perused the Bills of loading for the Ships Cargo dated Baltimore 9th January 1777-these declare the Cargo to be \""upon the proper Account and risque as per Advice\"" consigned to Thomas Morris.  Upon one of the Bills a special contract under hand and Seal is indorsed.  For the delivery of the Cargo at such Port as Thomas Morris of Pliarne, Penet and Company shall Order.  For the payment of additional freight and demurrage in certain stringent cases.  For payment of the valuation of the ship in case of loss by Willing and Morris.  But neither in that indorsed Contract nor on the face of the Bills does it appear that the United States were in any respect interrested or concerned in the voyage.  I have also perused the instrument of valuation of the Ship dated Baltimore sixth of January 1777 signed John Smith, Jonathan Hudson and Daniel Bowley who declare by the said instrument that they were called upon by Archibald Buchanan and John Cornthwaite, Copartner of John Brown in behalf of Willing, Morris and Company to value the Ship &c; no intimation in this instrument admits even a supposition that the United States were to be answerable in case the Ship should be lost.  It is true that on two of the Bills of Loading there appears the following indorsements.  Philada. Jany. 17, 1777. The within Iron is on Acct. of the United States of America as per Letter s[igned] Robt. Morris.  Philada. Jany 17, 1777. The within Tobacco is on Acct of the United States of America as per Letter s[igned] Robt. Morris.  I shall make no remark on these expost facto indorsements, nor  confront them by the Charter Party, the Bills of Loading, the special indorsed Contract nor the instrument of valuation, but I honestly confess that those jealousies which Mr. Lewis's information had raised in my mind at York Town are not removed.  I have caused diligent search to be made in the Commercial Committee's Office for copy of the Orders to John Brown or Brown and Cornthwaite for chartering and loading the Farmer, and for their letters in answer-for orders to Mr. Buchanan and his answer-for Letters to Thomas Morris & to Pliarne, Penet and Company respecting the consignation and the \""advice\"" of \""the proper Account and risque\"" referred to in the Bills of loading. For the necessary Entries on the Committees Books of the Orders for Chartering, Loading and Insuring the Vessel which ought to have appeared there in manner and stile clear and explicit.  The Clerk of the Office informs me that he has spent many hours seeking for these lights and can discover none of them nor any Papers concerning the Farmer excepting those before mentioned which were tyed up in one parcel and appeared to be all the documents relative to that Ship-but that he had not fully examined every Paper in the Office, it is possible therefore they may hereafter be found.  Neither can I discover the letter which Mr. Lewis says Mr. Morris sent to Congress informing them of \""a rumor spread in Philadelphia that the Ship was taken by the Enemy, but he hoped it was not true, if it was, he had fifty Hogsheads of Tobacco on board on his own Account.\""  The first extract produced by Mr. Lewis is copy of an entry on the Books that an Order was drawn by the Commercial Committee 16th April 1777 on the Treasury for payment of 14666 2/3 Dollars to the owners of the Ship Farmer for the valuation of that Ship, Chartered and insured by the Committee on public Account, said ship being taken in Chesapeake Bay on the twenty first day of January last by two of the Enemy's ships of War as appears by the Captains Protest.\""  The Protest sets forth that the Ship had been captured, but not of her being chartered and insured by the Committee on Public Account; nor does any one of the antecedent documents referred to above, tend to induce a belief that she was. The Committee must therefore have derived their knowledge that the Ship was \""chartered and insured on Public Account\"" from some other sources of information, for I will not suppose they would have drawn the Order for 14666 % Dollars, or have suffered the recited entry to be made in their Books but under the influence of some kind of proofs for their guide in the disposal of Public Money-two of the Committee are now present, these Gentlemen may possibly give the House such information on this head, as will remove every doubt and render further investigation unnecessary.(3)  Sir, I have not been thus minute from any wish or desire to criminate Mr. Robert Morris; Congress will remember I declared that my views in mentioning this subject at York Town were to do justice to that Gentleman as well as to the Public-but to return to Mr. Lewis' Paper.  If Mr. Lewis had been satisfied on the 16th of April 1777, four Months before I had the honor of his acquaintance that the Ship Farmer had been bona fide, chartered, insured, and loaded on Public Account, I demand, with what view, or for what good purpose did he. eight or ten Months after that date relate to me that Captain Dashiel had said his Ship \""was chartered by Messrs. Willing and Morris' Clerk, and that the Bills of Loading which the said Captain had signed were filled up shipp'd by Willing and Morris and that the Committee had therefore concluded that the Cargo was not on Public Account.\""  I quote Mr. Lewis' words of the 14th Instant delivered on Paper, not those which he really spoke to me at York Town. Did Mr. Lewis give this strange and inconclusive relation in order to convince me that our Commercial transactions, were not, \""in a confused state\""? Does it seem to have been calculated for hushing my complaints, implied in the hints which he says I gave of \""some Vessels employed in the Public service carrying Goods on the private Account of some Members of the Committee\""? Or did it rather, as I have most truly averred serve to \""heighten my jealousies by his frequent repetitions that our Commercial Affairs had been sadly conducted\""? That those Affairs had been sadly conducted requires no other proof than half an hours review of the Committee's Books.  Why did Mr. Lewis after I had briefly mentioned in Congress the information which he had given me of the Tobacco Ship and had appealed personally to him call on me and say, \""I am very sorry you mentioned that affair in Congress, because I intended to mention it to Mr. Morris myself\""?  And I now appeal to every candid mind, does not Mr. Lewis's present and very inconclusive narrative of what he calls a tete a tete conversation tend to excite suspicions of some hidden or unfair proceedings in the case of the ship Farmer?  The \""conclusions of the Committee that the Cargo was not on Public Account\"" one would naturally suppose were well grounded before they put the Public to the expence of equipping an extra Ship merely for the purpose of carrying dispatches. The owner of the Ship Farmer lived at Baltimore, a conference with him would instantly have removed all the difficulties which Captain Dashiel had raised.   The Ship Farmer was chartered on the third of October 1776, sailed on the 10th of January 1777 and captured on the 21st of that Month.  According to Mr. Lewis' state, the first insinuation that the bulk of the cargo was Public property appeared in Mr. Morris' Letter written subsequently to the capture informing Congress that he had fifty Hogsheads of Tobacco on board.  If the charter, the loading and the Insurance had been actually on Public Account, how came Mr. Lewis to remain in ignorance of these interresting facts at least four Months, and for aught we know, to this hour? I will beg Mr. Lewis' indulgence to ask him another question-If the Vessel was chartered and insured on Account of the Public, by whose permission and under what stipulations did Mr. Morris ship fifty Hogsheads of Tobacco on his private Account? But, Sir,-After all these appearances I do not charge Mr. Morris with fraud, I never did charge him with fraud, nor did I ever intend to do so from bare appearances, I honestly appealed to the Gentleman who had made a display of those appearances.  It will rest with Mr. Morris, unless the Commercial Committee can now give us satisfaction, by clear, explicit, unambiguous proofs to convince this House that his conduct was honest & justifiable.  The best friend Mr. Morris has in the World will not more sincerely rejoice than I shall, at the sight of such evidence.  If Mr. Morris' character has been unjustly drawn into suspicion, I am not the Man, who-from malice, wantonness, or stupid inattention to business placed, or suffered it to remain in an unfavorable light.  Had I harboured a malignant disposition for blasting that Gentlemans reputation I should long ago have searched for the Papers which I have, in the present instance been compelled to exhibit.  Every sensible Man will acknowledge they contain ample funds for slanderous whisper, but by the grace of God I have acted a more generous part; I briefly related to Congress what I had learned from Mr. Lewis, and to this Gentleman I appealed as my informant, thenceforward contenting myself with the reflection that I had done my duty. I shall conclude with saying that I have reason to believe I am not the only Gentleman to whom Mr. Lewis has, at some time or other expressed his dissatisfaction with the affair of the Ship Farmer, a mere dissatisfaction expressed by him has a tendency to excite jealousies in the minds of Men ignorant of the facts, but not of the universal opinion \""that our Commercial affairs had been sadly con- ducted.\"" (4)  Henry Laurens  ""

  My dear Sir Jany 19-79 Inclosd is the Newspaper of this Day. Philalethes,(1) in attempting to show that the Supplys from France were not a Present from that Court, which nobody that I know of has asserted, has abundantly proved one thing which Common Sense has insisted on viz that A Lee had been negociating with Mr Beaumarchais for those Supplys, before Mr Dean Arrivd there. No one I suppose would have thought of weighting Mr Deans Merit so critically, had he appeard content with his full Share of it. But when he takes so much Pains to represent his Colleagues as having done Nothing, it becomes a Piece of Justice to enquire whether they have in Reality been such unconcernd or impotent Spectators of their Countrys Misery and Want. Dr Franklin has the Honor of being Mr Deans venerable Friend; Mr Lee, an insignificant or troublesome Colleague. And yet Mary Johnsons (2) assiduous Applications procurd the sending a Ship loaded with Merchandise & Stores to the Value of twenty five Thousand Pounds Sterling; and this Negociation was settled before Mr Deans Arrival in France. Mr Lee acted as the political Minister, He pressd on Mr Beaumarchais \""the maintaining the War in America as the great Object.\"" And indeed it was so. Mr Lee and every Man of Discernment knew, that it was the Policy of France to consider it in this View. On this Consideration he succeeded, and yet, says Mr Beaumarchais, \""the Gratitude of Congress is due to the indefatigable Pains Mr Dean has taken thro' the whole of this Commercial Transaction.\"" The Truth is, as I suppose, that Mr Dean did not care to return without some such Letter of Recommendation; and it was probably as easily obtaind as the other which I mentiond in my last. Mr. Beaumarchais is a Man of Ingenuity & Wit. Horace was the Delight of the Court of Augustus. A Royal Letter & a Snuff Box, as I once told one of my Friends, are Things of Course, especially in the JANUARY 19, 1779  Honey Moon of National Matrimony. A Monarch politely compliments thro' the Minister the Ministers Sovereign. When the Merchant and the Courtier unite in one Man, the Courtier is safe in imitating his Master, and pays his Compliment in the Stile & Manner of the Merchant.  Mr. Deans Friends are in hopes he will be sent to Holland as a Reward for his good Services, from whence he may probably send or bring another mercantile Letter of Recommendation. Doubtless deep Commercial Connections may be formd there. They are willing Mr J A should go to Spain. The Design of this is to get Mr A L removd from thence. Others are for sending Mr A to Holland & leaving Mr L in Spain, to whose Influence in that Country our Armies are indebted for Supplys of Blanketts, Shoes and Stockins.

  Jan. 19. 1779. Yes, lovely Portia, you have written (1) to one \""who lives in the continual practice of mortification & self denial,\"" who therefore can & does most \""feelingly commiserate your situation.\""  I am pleased when You speak of my disinterested attachment to the public weal: for, I know you judge from Sensibilities to which the herd of worldlings are intire strangers. They would stare at your opinion, and gravely ask \""what Fortune does he sacrifice.\""  I fear not, from you, the tax of vanity when I hope my example may tend to strengthen your Patience. I will fortify my own by looking up to your dearest Friend, whom even the worldling will own to be a striking pattern.  You say 'tis near 11 months since he left Braintree. I find myself relieved by that period from a certain anxiety, which was founded on my tenderness towards yr. dear Sex that Mr. A's rigid patriotism had overcome. He used, in that Spirit, to contemplate with pleasure, a circumstance in you, the like of which in Mrs. L aggravated my absence from home, exceedingly. In spight therefore of his past reproofs to me, I will take pleasure in your Escape.  You may be assured, dear Lady, that not a line for you has arrived here, or any thing material to the public under yr. Husband's hand, JANUARY 19, 1779  or I should have communicated both the one, & the other so far as proper, to you speedily.  From the minutes now on my table I can only mention the Receipt of short letters from him of Apr. 28, Aug. 12, 14, 21. Before I seal, I shall be in the Secretary's office, and will add other dates, if I find them. Personally, I have not had a single line of answer, tho my almanac proves I have written 16 or 18 times to him. He is right in his short letters: The quarrels of others are as fiery Beacons to his prudence.  I am sorry you do not see all the papers from this quarter. The vanity of a late Envoy will work its own destruction. His chief antagonist here, tho indiscreet at times, is an overmatch for him in the scribbling way. The Lees are men of Probity as well as Science; and the advantage of speaking of them behind their backs will not turn out so great as was at first hoped by the Innuendo-Man; so R. H. Lee quaintly terms Mr. D.  Arthur Lee has no Commission but what Mr. Adams helped to give him 18 Months ago. There is no particular destination yet made of Mr. A , but there will be, shortly. I think Party can hurl no Dart against his Honor.  I will communicate to you from time to time any decision interesting to you.  As to our money; 'Till we get a foreign Loan, we can only patch & patch. There is a prospect of our succeeding in Holland. Our Cause gains strength there daily.  I do not think I shall soon be able to help you to flour. But my wishes are on constant watch.  You do not mention the Receipt of either a Scrawl from me of Novr. 14 or a Box sent by one Lusher who is returned hither, though I have not seen him.  As for Mr. Thaxter, I begin to suspect whether I was ever civil to him for one moment. He has never wrote to me a single line or sent me a verbal message of Direction where I am to find my Saddle-Bags which I lent him. \""There is nothing new under the Sun.\"" Why then should I be astonished on this Occasion?  \""Past 12 o Clock, and a rainy Morning\"" says the watchman under my Window. Taking his hint, and quitting, for the present my Converse with Virtue, Sense dr Beauty, shall I not find, on my pillow, a Repose sweet as that of a cradled Infant? or, if Fancy will maintain her domination jointly with Morpheus, shall I not realize the Slumbers of the Arcadians, and, therein, know myself yr. affectionate Friend.

  My Dear Bror. Philadelphia l9th Jany 1779 Your favor of the 4th inst which I received this day has releaved me from the greatest anxiety. Understanding you had not got home late in Decemr. I was very apprehensive that the severe weat[her] (which has been general through the Country) had caught you in the Mountains. I was rather led to apprehend this from your usual inattention to Your own safety in traveling the woods. It also gives me great Pleasure to hear our Mother has got into winter Quarters.  I am not a little surprised to find you so exceedingly alarmd at the publication of Mr D____ns. I shod have supposed you wod have recollected that there are two sides to a question. I think I have sent all the papers to Portsmouth since that publication, if you have seen them I immagine Common Sense has by this time set you right tho his publications are not proofs of his prudence they are not so inconsistant with truth as you may be led to suppose from certain disavowals which for Political reasons were necessary. The Republican gives you the just character of him or them who Mr. D____ endeavors to traduce. Want of time will not suffer me at present to go so fully into those matters as I otherwise might, but I shall be glad to be inform'd how these publications operate on the minds of People. You need be under no apprensions from parties for I assure you I never have seen less of that spirit than at present. The late President is really as good a man as I ever knew. He Resigned the Chair on Republican Principles having set in it more than a Year. The Chair is now exceedingly well filled.  I do not know what you mean by the Bubble on Connecticut River, as for the Northern Expedition you will hear more of that shortly and I dare say to Your satisfaction.  If I have time tomorrow before the post goes out I shall write to the Doctor.(1) If I shod not I hope you will comfort him a little, he seems to be greatly distressed, that a man that has been a Alderman of London shod be in the service of America.  I have another Pamphlet which shall be at your service when I have opportunity to send it. At present I shall content myself with sending you some newspapers by way of explination. I shall also send some to Col Langdon of different dates. Your very affect Bror, W.W.  ""

  Dear Sir Philadelphia Jany. 20th 1779 I receivd your kind favour by Mr. Pumroy & one other near of the same tenor, since I wish it was in my power to give you a Satisfactory Answer to the Contents, have been waiting for Mr. Pumroys return or should have wrote you before. Soon after Coll Roots & my arrival at this place Mr. Sherman set off for home & Coll Root was appointed to the board of Warr in his room & as Mr Pumroys Affairs & those of the Arrangement lay before that board I referrd Mr. Pumroy to Coll Root to expedite his business & also Committed to him your last letter relating to the Arrangement & have pressed upon him both expeditions in the one & that he would see Justice done in the Other, but unhappily Nothing is as yet brot to a Close in the Arrangement & Mr Pumroy will be able to Acquaint you fully what he has Obtained. A Copy of the Memorial which was preferrd to the Genll Assembly of Connecticut in Novr last from a Number of Officers in the Connecticut line was by direction of our Assembly Transmitted to Congress (1) which was read and Committed to a Comtee Appointed to Conferr with & Consult Genll Washington Present on many other Important matters relating to the Army, but as yet we have not receivd their report, but are Impatiently waiting for it. The Affair of Mr Dean has taken up Considerable time of late in Congress. He has been fully heard in every matter he chose to represent & lay before them, but no result as yet thereon. I could have wished Mr Dean had not began his publication. I rather think he will Suffer in Consequence thereof especially as he has Attackd the personal characters of some who have been thot by some worthy high Esteem & Confidence as he thereby raises a Storm against himself. Congress have been Oblidgd to Interpose & Censure some Clauses in the publications made by (Common Sense) as they Affected the Carracter of our New Allie, & ought to have been Avoided being made publick if true, but have no disposition to enter largely into this Subject but leave it to the publick discussions, tho have no doubt in my own mind but Mr Dean has much Merit (tho not wholly free from foibles & Imperfections) for which he ought to have a publick Approbation.  I this day after I had began this letter for the first never having any previous knowledge or Intimation from Mr. Lovel Your Letter Inclosed to him & directed to me made known & delivered me. I have just had a Moments time to run it through, believe it to Contain many Usefull hints remarks & Observations on the Affairs Congress has had Under Consideration & have allready concluded but it has come to my knowledge too late to be of any service & I must doubt whether any Member of Congress has been Acquainted with the Sentiments  JANUARY 20, 1779  herein containd except the Gentn to whom it was inclosed. On the receipt of yours more than a fornight agoe I attackd Mr. L____l on his Neglect you mentioned in not answering his Letters on which he Informed he had wrote you (2) which was then on its way, but he mentioned Nothing then of his having any letter in his possession open for his perrusal & directed to me. But however leave him & you to settle those matters as you think proper. The Opperations of the Next Compaine are left wholly to Genll Washington as Super Intendant of the whole. I hope some Effectual Methods will be taken to curb the insolence of the Savages & put it out of their power with absconding Tories to ravage & distress our Frontiers.

6608,dg011482,1779,Paper Currency,"""Paper Currency
  Philadelphia, January 20th [1779] Credit is founded on principles as fixed and uniform as any [in] nature- and, whether applied to individuals or nations, rises and falls with the prospect of their being able to pay their debts, with this additional circumstance, when applied to the latter, of their being also willing.  It was impossible but the credit of America should run low and her bills sink, so long as her independence was doubtful, and the odds apparently against her that she would fail in the present contest. JANUARY 20, 1779  But the prospect has changed. The independence of America now rests on sure ground, and is so established and confirmed that it can neither be overthrown nor given up.  Great-Britain has fully tried her strength and her arts upon it, but to little other purpose finally, it seems, than that of setting Europe in a blaze, and cutting out work for herself. All the troops she can now raise are called for to Gibraltar and the West-Indies, and she is obliged to embody militia for her internal defence and safety.  But let the rage of Great-Britain spend itself how or where it may, America has learned to despise it. America now finds herself in a proper state of defence. Her governments are at length established and vigorous; her counsels united and firm; her supplies for war plentiful; her army inured to the field, and, in prowess and discipline, superior to those who taught them the art of war. Her affairs also stand well abroad. Her Ambassadors are well and honourably received; the most illustrious and powerful Monarch in Europe is avowedly her friend and ally; and she is well secured in the principal interests of that quarter of the world. The fate of America is no longer doubtful. Her emancipation is complete and her empire established. It is the Lord's doing, and it should be marvellous in her eyes.  Talking now of her not being able to pay her debts, is talking merely by the force of habit. And to say that the credit of her bills will not rise, is as perfectly idle as to say the sun will not; and as much against the course of nature. However weak and credulous men may have been deluded and imposed on, the truth is, that there is not now a man of sober thought and forecast but sees that the bills shortly will and must rise. The event is as certain, from the nature of credit and present state of affairs, as that men will continue to love gain, and have discernment enough to find out where it lies. Was there any room for doubt in this matter before, there can be none now that the voice of America has been taken, and the Resolutions of Congress of the 2d of January have passed, establishing effectual means for the redemption of the bills, as well as adopting the necessary measures to prevent their discredit from counterfeits.  Those Resolutions will be seen and read of all men, and they need no comment. Designed for the approbation and benefit of all, they are easy to be understood, and carry their own evidence and sufficiency with them.  Do they, indeed, subject any to inconvenience by calling in the adulterated emissions? the public safety required the measure, and those who are most affected are most secured and benefitted by it. Do they also disclose and lay open to the world America's debt? it was impossible otherwise to establish and apply the means for sinking it. Nor indeed is this debt her shame, nor her weakness; especially when it is considered that she has all the money in hand to pay it with, and   is not really a farthing the poorer for owing it. What, of the price of her redemption, she has not paid down in the labors and blood of her own citizens, she has had credit for from herself, and is not, like the boasted mistress of the world, mortgaged to half the Princes in Germany for troops she can neither return nor pay for.  The debt of America is certain and must be paid; but, considering the occasion of it and the numbers to pay it, it cannot be called great. Less stock or produce of the country than would hereafter have sold for five millions sterling, would now cancel it; which is millions less than Great-Britain pays every year for interest, and but one fourth of what she expended last war in a single campaign. Was America, instead of nineteen years, to sink her whole debt to-morrow, a middling farmer for the eastern states, would not have more to pay than the avails of one yoke of fat oxen or fifty bushels of wheat; or if every inhabitant should pay equally, the price of five bushels would suffice for one. And tho' the same bushels of wheat that are competent to pay this debt, or any portion of it, now, will not continue so; yet the same bills will: and hence will probably arise a line of distinction between wise men and fools.  This easement, however, will be common to all, that as the debt swells by appreciation, the wealth and numbers to pay it will be encreasing also; and that, no doubt, with great rapidity, as the world will be America's range for commerce, and her inhabitants have been wont to double in little odds of twenty years. It ought also to be remembered here, that a revenue will arise, to help to pay this debt, from the sale of forfeited estates and the appropriation of debts due to British merchants (to say nothing of Crown Lands) of at least some millions.  But whatever may be the advantage of America for getting out of debt, it is very apparent she has got less in than could have reasonably been expected. And the true reason is, notwithstanding all the cry of extortion, that she has been cheaply served, and cheaper than a nation of freemen ever were before. No other cause can be assigned, and this one is obvious to the feelings of thousands.  Wherefore, with what grace could the public keep back part of the price, or, which is the same thing, call in her bills at a discount? This, however, it has been argued, she might do, and even refuse to call in or redeem them at all; and yet save to herself a good conscience, as well as great gain. The argument, if argument it may be called, stands thus-That when the public emitted those bills, and pledged her faith for the redemption of them, she was in great distress, and had no other way to help herself, and so was under a sort of duress or fatal necessity; and also that she made a bad bargain; and furthermore that some of her subjects will grow too rich if she does not vacate it; so that upon the whole, duress, bad bargain, and dangerous consequences all put together, her contract is of no force-to be sure not more than a fourth  or sixth part of it. This reasoning may be thought oeconomical, but it is not subtle enough to answer the end proposed. Whatever else America may be tempted to, she never can be brought to a violation of her own faith. Should she totally lose all sense of honor and all sense of shame, which God forbid, yet still she has guards against perfidy too strong to be broken through. She could not violate her faith, without at once and forever losing all confidence of her citizens. She could not violate her faith without disgracing herself with all nations, and disqualifying herself for all treaties. She could not violate her faith without incensing the Almighty and daring his vengeance against her. She could not violate her faith and destroy her currency without effectually depriving herself of the means of defence. In a word any violation of the public faith, on which her paper currency rests, would be madness, atheism and suicide. The mists and doubts raised on this subject of late, by enemies and the arts of wicked and designing men, are evidently beginning to subside and will soon totally vanish. When multitudes will be left to wonder at their own credulity and curse their deceivers.

I see no danger this way of a loss of influence. Some little convulsions are always necessary to let people know themselves. I hope the plan of finance will have a good effect, but something farther must be done. I hope New Hampshire will tax largely and not confine herself to the 500,000-her proportion was set higher, but I got it lowered in order that she might be more at liberty to act herself.(1) Many of the States will tax much more than the sums set to them. Virginia will raise between 2 and 3 millions lawful. Those States that tax very high while money is thus plenty will certainly find their advantage in it. I shall write you a long letter the first opportunity, but at present I have not time to add save that I am very Sincerely, Your most affectionate friend &c, Wm. Whipple  ""

I had the honor of receiving your favor of the 18th Instant intimating the request of the Board of Treasury \""that I would lay before them the expenditures for supporting my Household as well as other incidental charges while I officiated as President of Congress.\"" In answer I must observe Congress were truly informed in my Letter of the l9th Ultimo (1) that as I had not been taught to expect a reimbursement of my expences I had kept no particular Account of them, therefore I intreated the House to excuse me from attempting to render Accounts which it was impossible for me to frame with any degree of accuracy, and that they would be pleased to accept my services of that kind as a very small return for their friendship.  I would now most earnestly repeat my request had not the House resolved against it, nevertheless it is impossible for me to render particular Accounts, because I kept none; the nearest computation that I can form is, one thousand Pounds Sterling in Bills of Exchange, about forty Guineas in Gold, four thousand Continental Dollars, exclusive of House rent in Philadelphia, Servants, Carriage and Horses, firing, Candles, Stationary, some extra Household furniture, a Pipe of Wine and other liquors supplied me by Major West and Colonel Cox-the whole account may be suitable enough to the JANUARY 21, 1779  vicious fashion of the day, but with shame I confess it to be altogether anti-republican and inconsistent with the circumstances of the distressed States of America.

Under cover with this you will receive an Account of my advances to a Secretary, for I employed but one at a time, to Express Messengrs &c which you will be pleased to lay before the Honorable Board, and if it shall be found free from error, a Warrent on the Treasury for the Balance 3394 15/90 Dollars, will be very acceptable.(2)  I have the honor to be, With great regard, Sir, Your obedient & most humble Servant.

  Dear Livingston Phila. 21st Jany. 1779. Were it not that I sometimes hear there is somewhere in Existence such a Person as the Chancellor of N York I should really begin to think you had launched upon the Stygian Ferry and wearied with the Cabals of a Republic made choise of the absolute Government of the galant tho gloomy Pluto. Is it that you are so busied in heavenly Contemplation as to need a Flapper, or so buried in Indolence as to require a Blister? Come tell me your Disease. Is it because you love Chess so much that you love your Friends so little? Does the Blandishment of Family Enjoyments of domestick Bliss chain your aspiring Soul to your Chimney Corner? Have you lost the Paternal Regards of your great Family the People because some of the Boys are forward, arch and mischeivous? Have you because encountered by Intrigue and Cabal lost a Sense of your own Dignity so as to sink under Evils which Spirit and Activity would surmount? Come I will make no more impertinent Enquiries. You know your own weak Side. Put Armour on it. Sit down half an Hour and suppose yourself unconnected with all the  JANUARY 21, 1779  World. Suppose yourself young, ambitious, sensible, versed in Mankind, a good Lawyer and (but for Easiness) a good Politician. So very well. Now take a Survey of the Ground you have to act on. Where are the Eminences? They must be gained-They must be gained. Take Care the Enemy do not take you in Flank. If you are penetrated you are lost. Will not some of their Forces revolt? Try them pliant Salius. Take Ceres, Bacchus and Minerva to your Aid. The Graces will not desert you and they are an excellent Band. Keep them skirmishing en avant. You cannot be mediocre and by Heaven if you do not fill the first Rank brillant comme L'astre du jour You deserve tenfold Shame and may expect it as the proper Reward of your Ingloriousness.  It was not in my Power to obtain for your Brother the Rank which both you and I know him to deserve. Obstacles in the Way of it were too easily raised by Policy for Friendship to get over. His Resignation hath been accepted with tokens of Regard equally flattering and uncommon.(1)Indulge me while I wish that he will make the proper Use of it which certainly is not the raising of III Will and Envy among those who were his Brother Officers. Thus you see my Friend my Heart still speaks to you with the same warmth of Freedom which always animated it towards you. Let yours make some Answer and I intreat you give me the consoling Reflection that not one Moment shall be spent in Listlessness for three Months to come.

  Sir, Phila. 21st Jan'y 1779. We have to address your Excellency on a Subject which is honorable to our Constituents and of great use to the United States. Our worthy Colleague Mr. Jay since his Elevation to the Chair by filling it with Dignity and Impartiality, hath given such general Satisfaction that  JANUARY 21, 1779  we are by no means singular in our Regret that we are so soon to be deprived of his abilities in that important Office. We are not ignorant of the Benefits which the State would derive from his Presence and Services on the Bench of Justice and in the Council of Revision. We therefore shall make no Request. Permit us Sir thro your Excellency to assure the Legislature that should they think proper to extend his appointment to the End of the year (1) it will be agreeable to the several Members of Congress and particularly so to Your Excellency's most obedient & humble Servants, Fra's Lewis  Gouv'r Morris.  P.S. Having prepared the above Letter and shewn it to Mr. Duane, he declined signing it, unless he could previously know whether Mr. Jay approved of it, which (having sounded him on the Subject before) I ventured to assure him that I believed he did not. Tho from motives of Delicacy as your Excellency will easily perceive a Communication of the Letter would have been improper. Mr. Floyd also declined the Signing of it, tho he approvd of the Contents but observed that he did not like to dictate a Conduct to his Constituents. I thought it material to say this much lest it should seem extraordinary that the Letter was only signed by Mr. Lewis and myself. I am respectfully Your Excellency's obed't & humble Serv't Gouv'r Morris Reprinted from Clinton, Papers (Hastings), 4:514-15.  1 John Jay's special appointment as a delegate to Congress was due to expire on March 1, 1779, but Governor Clinton extended it \""untill thirty Days after the next Meeting of the Legislature,\"" when it was re extended until October 15, 1779.

  Sir [January 23? 1779] (1) Perhaps it is of little importance to the present World as it will be \""for the benefit of succeeding generations\"" to know from what motives or under what influence Mr. Laurens the late President of Congress submitted to continue in the Chair after the 31st October last, but since the circumstance has been alluded to & variously related in print by two writers without the previous consent or knowledge of that Gentleman, & by neither of them exactly stated, I will for your better information, recite to you in a few words, the fact.(2)  Mr. Laurens had frequently intimated to Members of Congress, his intention of retiring from the Office of President on the day abovementioned when he should have served in it one year-he had as often expressed his approbation of the inhibitory clause in the 9th article of Confederation \""that no person be allowed to serve in the office of President more than one Year in any term of three Years,\"" & also his earnest desire to comply with it in the first Instance. Agreeably to these sentiments he put Congress in mind on the 31st October being Saturday, that his Years service would expire upon the adjournment of that day. He humbly desired leave to retire, & intreated the House to think of a Member to succeed him. After some debate or conversation it was determined, without a vote, to deliberate on the subject in the interval between the adjournment & the next intended meeting.  On Monday the 2d November Mr. Laurens, not in the Chair, but JANUARY 23, 1779  being called upon to take it, moved the Members then present in the Congress Hall, to proceed to the election of a President, declaring his abhorrence of all affected disqualifying speeches, that he meant to offer none such, although he was persuaded there were Gentlemen on the floor better qualified for the Office than himself, but that he was extremely desirous, of being relieved, as well as of shewing a proper observance to the restrictive Proviso in the Articles of Confederation.  After some debate & conversation a Member suggested that it would be highly improper to proceed unless the President would take the Chair. Mr. Laurens replied that in his opinion, such formality was not necessary, nevertheless if Gentlemen thought it would be a means of facilitating business he would comply-when he had taken the Chair addresses & private Conferences ensued on the floor, altogether as impossible as it would be unessential (3) to recapitulate; eventually an old & respectable Member (4) who appeared to have been chosen & instructed for the purpose addressed the President in terms of assurance, that the House were entirely satisfied with his past services, & that it was their unanimous request he would continue to sit in the Chair until the Articles of Confederation should be acceded to by all the States, or at least, for some time longer. It was this honorary unanimous request, \""in which he acquiesced.\""  Permit me now Sir, to inform you how it came to pass, that this \""unanimous request\"" was omitted on the Journal.(5) The Secretary of Congress had prepared the form of an Entry for the purpose, which he laid before the President for his approbation or amendment; after a moments reflection Mr. Laurens replied to the Secretary, that an Entry was unnecessary, his sole view was to serve his Country, that he had no anxiety for obtaining complimentary Records. I will mention another circumstance, which will afford further satisfaction to a Lover of truth.  Although there was not a full Congress on the 2d November, yet comparatively & according to common acceptation, the House was not thin. This will appear by reference to the Journal.  The above, Philalethes, is a brief & true state of the Case in question, which will be confirmed to you by every Member who attended Congress on the 31st October & 2d November 1778, if you will take the trouble of appealing to them.  But I do not mean to charge either you or Common Sense with wilful or mischievous aberation from Truth.  The History of the miraculous feeding a multitude of four or five thousand Persons [with a few] loaves & fishes is differently related by Mathew & Mark-yet both these Evangelists have been in full Credit throughout Christendom upwards of 1700 Years, and will continue to be so to the end of time.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia Jany. 24th 1779 I received yours of the 15th of December, and have since found that the sentence of the court martial on Crossing & his associates answer'd my expectation.(1) The Court could not have done otherwise consistent with Law and justice; but it seems there is danger of retaliation in case the sentence should be executed. I should be very sorry if the execution of that infamous traitor, should occasion the death of any especially of a worthy whig. Genl. Prescott I find by your last letter to Congress on this subject is very solicitous to preserve the lives of Crossing & Phillips. His Aid, if I remember right, told you that they both had Commissions. If this should be the case: If they had commissions from the K[ing] of Britain previous to their kidnapping Army &c. it would make a material alteration in their Cases; but I doubt this very much. If they had commissions why were they not produced at their trial: certainly there was time enough for that purpose, between the capture and trial; and why did not the Aid bring them to Providence? If Genl. Prescot will declare bona fide that they had those Commissions previous to their kidnapping expedition, and exhibit them to you, I should give some Credit to such declaration & exhibit; but I must confess I am not satisfied with the Story of his Aid. The proceedings of the Court-martial are committed, and I am one of the Committee. I should chuse to have fuller  JANUARY 25, 1779  light, than I have at present, before I can give Judgment: Therefore could wish, if you should receive any further information, that you would communicate it to Congress.  Before this reaches you, you will doubtless have heard that the enemy consisting of about 2500 have taken possession of Georgia. Our accounts respecting this matter are confused. A few days since I saw a late Charlestown paper which advises that 6 sail of Count De Estaings Squadron were spoke with off Deseada, and that they had taken & sent into Martinico 7 transports with Troops from N. York bound to the W. Indias. That 2 transports with 300 Green-Coats on board had, under Convoy of the Camilla & Galatea, arrived at Bermudas, & that as many more were to follow them. (I have since heard that they were invalids and were sent to garrison that place.) The same paper mentions that a Vessel (which left Calais the 17th of November) had arrived at Charlestown and brot account that there had been no engagement between the French & British fleets and that Ld. Sandwich was put into the Tower.  I saw lately at Stephen Collins where I lodge a pretty young woman, who told me that her Husband Francis Brindley,(2) who was a first Lieutenant in Abraham Livingston's Company, was dangerously wounded in the battle of Portsmouth, that She had heard nothing from him since she received that information, and desired that I would be so kind as to write to you on this Subject. Now, Sir, as I strongly suspect that you are, at least, as fond of obliging pretty women as I am, let me request you, Sir, in her behalf to make inquiry after this same Francis Brindley and let me know whether he is dead or living. I shall be also much obliged to you if you would inform me what Number of Vessels of War the enemy distroyed in our State during your expedition agst Rhode Island; the present State of your and the enemy's Army &c. For doing this you will much oblige, Yr most humble Servant,  William Ellery  ""

  25th January 1779.  It appears that a detachment of the Enemy's Troops by no means inconsiderable have possessed themselves of Savannah the Capital of JANUARY 25, 1779  Georgia. Their numbers cannot be ascertained, but it is between 2500 and 5000. Their Naval force is by no means considerable, consisting of a 50 and 40 gun Ship, two sloops of war and some gallies. By this Stroke they are in capacity more effectually to defend their possessions in East Florida, to annoy the southern parts of South Carolina, perhaps in a favorable moment to attack Charlestown.  They will draw from Georgia immense Supplies of provisions for their troops in America and the Islands. Their cruizers will shut up the navigation of South Carolina, and not only possess themselves of the property at sea intended for that State, but what is of greater importance totally prevent the sending of rice from thence for the use of our Allies in the Islands. It is a melancholy truth that little dependence can be prudently placed on the wheat and flour of the more Northern States until the next harvest. But however great the advantages above Stated they derive one of far more value considered on a general Scale. The riches of Mexico and Peru are in a manner locked up, unless the southern extremities of America, and the Bahama Islands can be wrested from their possession, and it is highly probable that the expedition takes its rise from the apprehension of a war with Spain. While we lament the inconveniences which will be felt from the loss of Georgia, we cannot but derive pleasure from a consideration how much they have exposed themselves-should the Situation of affairs in the Islands permit such detachment from the combined fleets of France and Spain, or either of them as would prevent their escape by sea, while a body of good French or Spanish thrown in some favorable Situation between Savannah and Augustin would prevent their retreat that Way until the force now assembling in Virginia and the Carolinas could be collected to operate against them with effect. On a view of these circumstances it appears extremely probable that the consequences of the measure would be not only the destruction of that detachment of the Enemy's force, but the possession of all those ports which secure the navigation of Mexico and gulph of Florida, the essential advantages of which during the future operations of the war are too evident to need illustration.  The above paper (1) agreed to in Committee of Conference with the Commander in Chief and directed to be delivered to the President of Congress, as the substance of intelligence respecting the invasion of Georgia.

  Revd & dear Sir (1) Philada. Jany 26, 1779  Your kind letter of the 29 Decr. I have recd. & sincerely thank you for.  I am waiting, Sir, as well as you, tho' perhaps with less concern & more doubt, to see how the great events now taking place in the world will affect the moral State of it. Whatever light you may obtain in this matter from prophecies, I confess I have none from Congress nor the book of nature. Of this only I am satisfied, that whatever be the design of Providence in this respect, the powers at war have very little design about it & terminate their views with wealth & empire, leaving religion pretty much out of the question.  With regard to the court of France, in particular, if I am rightly informed, they have themselves no religion at all; & care much less than in former reigns, what or whether any the nation has. They are shifting their policy from superstition to dessipation. Paris, a place not of business, but enjoyment, is made the gayest city in the world & furnished with every amusement and gratification in the compass of nature, to draw together (S drain & drain) there men that from having property & time for brooding, might be dangerous in the country. A standing army does for the rest, & they have less & less occasion for popery. Nor do I apprehend there is any more danger of its (visiting us) spreading in this Country since the alliance than before. I wish I could add the same of Deism, which besides the advantage of high fashion, has its way paved by a dissolution of manners too incident to a state of war. But it is sufficient, dear Sir, that God governs the world, & that his purposes of Grace will be accomplished.  For my thots, on the present state of our political affairs, especially  JANUARY 26, 1779  on the state of our paper currency, I will refer you to a short piece you have seen or will see in Hartford paper under the signature of observator.(2)  How Mr. Deans address, after which you enquire, has been recd. by the publick I can give but little acct.-but sure I am it was unnecessary & injudicious; & I believe he joins with me in wishing it had never made its appearance.  In the personal interviews he had with Congress soon after his arrival from France, he had full opportunity to have criminated any of their servants if had thot there was occasion for it; nor has he at any time been precluded from doing it, or laying before Congress in writing any information he pleased on any subject whatever. It might have been expected perhaps that Congress should not so long have delayed a close of his examination & expressing their sense of his conduct abroad; & it has been truly unfortunate that any circumstances have concurred to render that delay necessary. Mr. Dean has now been fully heard personally before Congress, pursuant to their resolution passed & which he was made acquainted with, someday, before his publication, for a full enquiry into the State & negociation of their foreign affairs.  His attention to the business he was sent upon & skill & success in the execution of it are very apparent; & I will not say but every part of his conduct abroad is deserving of & will finally obtain the approbation of Congress and the publick.  I rejoice to hear that your & my father's family as well [as] people in general in your quarter, are favoured with so great a blessing as health, which I pray may be continued with the addition of all other blessings.  You will please to make my compliments to Mrs. Hinsdale, & believe me to be, Revd. & dear Sir, with much respect & esteem, your obed., humble Serv.

  Sir Philadelphia, January 28th, 1779. I received your favor of this day, and laid it before the Committee.(1)  We concur with you in every wish that the business referred to us may be discussed and decided upon principles of law, justice and reason, and know of none other than ought or can influence the Congress therein.  We have yet discovered nothing in the Business that can affect the temper or indanger the harmony which we believe subsists between Congress and the state of Pennsylvania.  We do not suppose that the general power of Congress to decide as the last resort in all cases of captures is denied or affected by the JANUARY 28, 1779  opposition given by the Judge of admiralty in Pennsylvania in the case referred to us, the Judge has been requested to certify his reasons; he has declared that the law of the state has made the finding of a Jury conclusive in all matters of fact, without reexamination or appeal, and that he is precluded by this law from enforcing any decree contrary to the verdict of a Jury, he has offered arguments in support of his conduct, and the only question seems to be whether the municipal law of any one state can control or restrain the exercise of the power to decide finally on all cases of captures? This question ought, and we hope will be discussed and decided on principles of law, justice and reason, and we doubt not if it shall be found that the Legislature of Pennsylvania have mistaken or overlooked any principle, and through such mistake or Inadvertance have passed a law which has an injurious effect contrary to their expectation and wishes, the members composing it have too much liberality to persist, and too much temper and good sense to take offence at men who may be by their duty called on to decide. In short we none of us conceive this affair to have proceeded from any thing but those imperfections of human language and human understanding from which no rank or condition of men is exempt, and we have no apprehensions that any evil can arise from the result of the deliberations and decisions of Congress on it. We are exceedingly willing to receive every information possible on the subject, and have appointed to-morrow afternoon to hear whatever the parties may be pleased to suggest; the Committee will meet at the State House at six o'clock.(2)  I am Sir, with great esteem and respect, your very obed't serv't, Thos.

  Sir [January 29? 1779] (1) The candor and frankness which have distinguished all your negociations with these States, impose particular obligations on Congress to observe on all occasions the like conduct towards you.  They consider the Arms of the Allies as united in one common Cause for the great purpose of effectually maintaining the Liberty, Sovereignty and Independence absolute and unlimited of these States, and for mutual aid during the course of the War and they admire the wise provision, made by the Treaty for preserving the harmony subsisting between them by excluding all after claims of compensation on one Side or on the other, whatever may be the event of the War.  How far the fourth Article of the Treaty (2) directs a stipulation for compensation to precede a particular Enterprize proposed by one Party, and to which the aid of the other is requested, has been taken by Congress into consideration.  They are of opinion that the compensation mentioned in that Article cannot relate to Enterprizes essential to the design of the Alliance and which may be proposed and undertaken by either Party to secure, not extend, their respective Territories, or to diminish the power of the Enemy by defeating their Fleets and Armies, not conquering their Countries or Cities.  The Expedition in question aims at nothing more than the expulsion of the Enemy from a state which cannot be Sovereign and Independent while they remain Masters of its Capital, and by destroying part of their force, advance the declared end of the War, which is to compel the Enemy to yield the great objects of the Alliance.  This Enterprise therefore must be considered in the same light with all other joint and ordinary exertions of force against the Com- JANUARY 29, 1779  mon Enemy, and can give to neither Party any more claim to compensation than they would have derived from the reduction of Rhode Island by the United forces which operated against it.  But on the other hand, if, after expelling the Enemy from Georgia, Congress should extend their views, and concert an Enterprize against St. Augustine, and request the aid of France in executing it, there can be no doubt but that according to the Article in question a prior Convention ought to regulate the proportion of force each should furnish, and the share of advantage which each should reap by the conquest-because as in this case, new Territory is to be acquired. Reason demands that both Parties concerned in the acquisition should have its due proportion of this, as well as all other joint prizes.  However, Sir, as Congress ardently wish to render the Alliance perpetual, and therefore are sollicitous to avoid all cause of future discontent or dispute, they forbear on this occasion to request or sollicit, but only recommend to Count d'Estaing to detach to Georgia such part of his Fleet as may answer the purpose intended, provided he be not so engaged in more important Expeditions so far as to render a compliance impracticable or improper-in this recommendation they request the favor of you to join-they view it as a Military Manouvre which appears worthy of attention, and in that light only, submit it to your and his consideration.  It gives me pleasure, Sir, to be authorized & directed to assure you, that as on the one hand these States will faithfully observe the Treaty, and make the most strenuous efforts against the common Enemy, they entertain not the least doubt but that their great Ally as well as his Ministers and Officers in every department are influenced by the same principles, and will chearfully exert all the Power of his formidable Kingdom to obtain the avowed important objects of the noble and Liberal Treaty he hath concluded with these States.  The above was framed by the President. The following proposed by Mr. Laurens to be introduced or added-in order to avert a charge of pertinacity, and to expedite business.  \""Upon the whole Sir, should the Count d'Estaing afford such aid and succor as may be in his power, to Georgia & South Carolina Congress will chearfully accord in your proposition, that compensation shall be a subject for future discussion according to the true intent and meaning of the Treaty of Alliance.\""  Gentlemen were dissatisfied-a motion was made to take the sense of the House whether by the fourth Article of the Treaty any compensation ought to be demanded, for the aid intended to be applied for.  I considered this to be an ambiguous stating, and that a flat determination in the negative by one Party might be ill received by the other, therefore when the question was about to be put, I moved that the previous question which was carried, that, that question should not be now put-and here, to my grief and amazement the business rests.(3)  31st January.

  Dear Sir 29 January [1779] I am indebted for Your Excellency's undermentioned Letters received in the following order: 1st & 3d Instant by Messenger Byers- 24th, 26th, & 28th Decr. on the 22d Instant by Sharp-9th Instant received yesterday by Hosea Stoddard.(1) All these have been duly communicated to Congress and all excepting the last to General Washington, this shall be laid before him some time in the present day.  At the special requests of the President of Congress and of my Colleague Drayton I had detained Byers from the 24th Inst. for the purpose of conducting Public and private Despatches for Charlestown-late yesterday I learned the President had ordered a Messenger from the Board of War and from himself that he had forgot to inform me of it. I intend this short Address to go if possible by that conveyance but as I was detained on a Committee to a very late hour last night, it is somewhat uncertain whether I shall have finished in time although I have risen very early for the purpose; be that as it may Byers shall be dispatched early to morrow, he will not be far behind the other.  Your Excellency is well acquainted with my anxious forebodings of the distress of Georgia. All that I have offered from time to time, for upwards of twelve Months past met with slight-will not say contemptuous receptions. When a proposition was made in August 1777 for an Enterprise to West Florida which appeared to me to promise nothing more than an ineffectual dissipation of Men and Money, I reminded Congress of the weak state of Georgia and South Carolina.(2) I succeeded so far as tended to quash the attempt, but could never prevail on the House to dispose of the intended means for the security of a weak frontier.  My labors for five Months past have been incessant for fixing the JANUARY 29, 1779  attention of the higher Powers to the safety of the Southern States. Your Excellency shall in due time see all my Letters on this subject, and which not being properly supported, Gentlemen in general concluded that I was either deficient in my political Ideas or unnecessarily and partially apprehensive of danger in the quarter where my own and the Estates of my particular friends happen to be situated. I have nothing to offer in support of a penetrative judgment, but the sacrifices which I have made them, ought, I think, to have shielded me against the smallest imputation of selfishness. I am reduced to the state of many an old Man to content myself with saying \""I told you so. \""  I am rejoiced that Your Excellency has advertised Count d'Estaing of the circumstances of the two Southernmost States. I was confident you had done so before your advices reach'd me. I had suggested the Idea of writing to the Count to the same effect by special advice Boats from hence, Maryland and Virginia. The President of Congress requested instructions upon the occasion. The subject appeared to me to be narrow and concise, however a Committee was ordered to prepare the required foundation, this was done on the 25th Instant (3) -the President was then to confer with Mr. Gérard, he did so, and reported yesterday \""that the Minister expected that the application for the aid to be asked of Count d'Estaing should be accompanied with assurance of compensation agreeably to the spirit and meaning of the fourth Article of the Treaty of Alliance to be hereafter settled by a Convention between the Court of France and the United States.\"" A Committee was thereupon appointed to take the same into consideration and to confer with the Minister on the subject, Mr. Laurens, Mr. S. Adams and Mr. Paca were the Committee, and were unanimously of opinion the fourth Article did not apply to the present case. I have not time to set forth the reasonings in which Congress seemed generally to concur, and some were a little fired by the obstacle. Mr. Gérard had in our conference adhered to his first opinion-I think it unlucky that, we applied for his intervention. If the fourth Article is obligatory, it will ever be so, and might have rested as a subject for future discussion, for the compensation, if any is to be made, must be discussed on a future day-here the business was hung by the Eyelids at our adjournment Yesterday, and will be resumed this Morning,(4) all this tends to lengthen a dangerous delay. I flatter myself with hopes that Your Excellency's letter to Count d'Estaing has reached him before this day, in this case I am persuaded he will, without hesitation and with much alacrity grant all that Congress meant or intended to ask-\""such relief as may be in his power.\"" (5) I do not exactly quote the words of the Journal-but these contain substantially and precisely the meaning.   The President will have acquainted Your Excellency with the recommendations of Congress to the States of Virginia and North Carolina to afford you all possible aid.(6) I am grieved by the knowledge of your deficiency in Military Stores, and the more so from an assurance which I have been long pressing on the minds of those whom it most concerns, that we are not only deficient of the same Articles here, but that from a criminal inattention we have no grounds to hope for a speedy supply.  I am exceedingly anxious to return to my own Country at this critical juncture-my Son if possible is more desirous. I feel deeply for the circumstances of my Neighbours and fellow Citizens-but many of my friends in, and out of Congress press me to stay. I am, at least until some affairs now on the Carpet shall be adjusted-the next Courier from Charlestown will probably determine me. If you are in great danger my pace shall be quickened, that I may stand or fall with those with whom I am most nearly connected.  I believe Sir it will be impossible for me to write to our worthy friend Gervais by this Conveyance. I moved for the million of Dollars he required and obtained an immediate vote on the 21st Instant.(7) I hope the Treasury have done their duty, and that the Money is now on its way. I have the honor to be-with all possible Esteem & Respect, Sir Your Excellencys Obedt. & Humble Servt. H.L.  ""

  Sir [January 29? 1779] (1) Congress have not yet laid down any permanent Principle to ascertain each State's Proportion of Men and Money: what is suggested on this Subject in the Articles of Confederation is not compleated and therefore could not be adopted. The late Apportionment of JANUARY 29, 1779  Monies was made according to Principles which originally obtained that is according to the Number of Souls in each State as ascertained by Estimates formerly furnished by the Delegates. But even this Mode was not strictly attended to: Rhode Island & New York being invaded were unable to pay the whole of their Proportion and Georgia for the like Cause not able to pay any Money at all: the Deficiency of these States was thrown on the rest tho' not in equal Dividend: some of the States having taken upon themselves more than their Proportion, induced by the Idea, that they contribute to sink their Debt with more Facility while they abound in Paper Emissions than when the Quantity is reduced and our Currency appreciated: Part of this Deficiency has been imposed on Maryland but less than her Proportion of it.  Congress having adopted a temporary Mode of Apportionment and not intending to conclude the States by it have to prevent Injury from unequal Assessments resolved that all the Sums of Money which the States are called on to raise shall be placed to their respective Credits on Interest. When the Rule therefore of Apportionment comes to be established such States who shall be found to have advanced beyond their annual Quota will be compensated by Interest on such Advances.(2)  We have the Honor to be Sir, Your most Obedient Humble Servants,  Wm.

The purchasers of the Wabach that are represented, are willing (if the 600 Strg. should not prove sufficient to rectify the Deed) to leave the Terms upon which it shall be rectified to further discussion. Your opinion and that of the Gentlemen in Annapolis for whom I act must be communicated to me or some one of their Attornies before any thing can be done.(1)  Agreeable to your Letter of the 23 July the Delegates have from Time to Time furnished Mr. Randal with four thousand pounds for supplying the Maryland officers with certain Necessaries. He called upon them the other Day to exchange 4281 Dols. which he had receiv'd of the officers of those two Emissions which are directed by Congress to be called by the first of June. The Delegates were at some loss what to do.(2) The Money would not pass at all in some places, where he wanted to lay it out, and in none, without a very considerable discount. To subject the State to a certain loss, when it was in their power to prevent it, could not be justified. They therefore concluded to exchange, out of the Money belonging to the State, the 4281 Dollars for other Emissions, and directed Mr. Randall to send the Dollars as exchanged to you. The Delegates had no Authority to put it in the Loan office, and were of Necessity obliged to direct him JANUARY 30, 1779  to forward the Money to you--This step they hope will meet with your approbation.  The Delegates have been informed, that the State has granted to each of their commissioned officers, one hundred and fifty pounds- They have repeated applications made to them by the officers for this grant. They have supplied some of them and taken their orders. The officers are anxious to receive this favour of their Country, and if it is in your power to send it forward to the care of the Delegates-it will be doing them a signal Service. Every thing is rising and the sooner they have an opportunity of laying out their Money the more advantage they will derive from it.  Congress received Letters yesterday from Genl Lincoln and Howe as late as the 11th Inst. Our affairs do not wear a pleasing aspect in that quarter. The Enemy have at length discovered our weak part, and are taking advantage of it. Their Fleet and Army to the Southward penetrated Savannah River and on the 29th landed within two Miles of Savannah Town. A Disposition of our little band was made by Genl. Howe to engage them. The Contest was short-The great Superiority of the Enemy soon compelled our Troops to retreat. The Enemys force is computed at three Thousand commanded by Col. Campbell, a very brave and gallant officer. Our own did not exceed six hundred. The loss we have sustained is not accurately known. Few are killed, which is a little surprising, as the retreat was affected by under a very heavy fire from four Times their Number. Genl Howe has taken post at Ebenezer on this side the Savannah River where he means to make the best defence, his small force will inable him to do till the arrival of Genl Lincoln. I dispair of soon having a force sufficient to oppose the Enemy; Many of the Inhabitants and some of high rank in Georgia have joined them-others will no doubt follow them and take advantage of a proclamation, which the Enemy have published. But the greatest source of Danger, is the accession of strength they will probably receive, from the black Inhabitants. Arms, we have some reason to believe, has been sent into that Country, for such purposes; and in my own opinion, if they are resolved to prosecute the Measure, and to break through every tie of honor and Humanity, they will gain considerable Strength.  I am Sir with Sincerity and Affection, Yrs. J. Henry Junr.  ""

It gave me concern when I heard of the fall you met with soon after you left us, but hope you are fully restored.  The disappointments that you have met with by not being furnished with troops & other necessaries for an expedition against E. Florida, as you expected must be very mortifying, however it was no more than I expected, but I perceive you are likely to have business enough nearer home; Your last letters to Congress are now under consideration (1) & I expect some resolutions will soon be come into & forwarded with all possible dispatch; The arms you mention as being in the stores at S. Carolina, Mr. Drayton one of the delegates from that state, thinks they do not belong to the continent.  The great personal respect I have for you, always operated in my mind against your going to the Southward, but hope you'l be supported in the important affairs you are ingaged in.  We are expecting news from your quarter, & have nothing here worthy your attention, to be depended on; It is said the Count De Estaing has lost a number of men in attempting to storm a fort in the west Indies.  An unhappy dispute has arose between some of our agents on the other side of the water, but I think it most prudent to make but one remark at present upon their conduct (viz.) I think they were very imprudent to get into such a dispute at this time. No doubt you have seen a number of pieces in the public prints respecting the above affair, under the Signature of Common Sense, Plain Truth, &c, &c, but I hope the good people will not form a Judgment upon the matter, before they can be better informd.  Your letters to Mrs. Lincoln was duly noticed, & it will always give me pleasure to render you any services this way.

  Dear Sir 31 January [1779] I had the honor of addressing Your Excellency on the 29th Instant by a Public Messenger who proceeded the same day on his journey- Byers, the bearer hereof, may possibly be first in, therefore I have prefaced this with a Copy of the former.  Your Excellency will learn from a Piece of Paper here inclosed that we have not advanced one Step in our intended application to the Count d'Estaing, this stagnancy is probably the effect of misapprehension-the Journal of Congress direct that an application be made to Count d'Estaing for such aid or relief as may be in his power to afford.(1)  The Minister seems to have affixed his attention to a Paper which had been prepared by a Committee for the President, setting forth the distressed circumstances of Georgia, the dangerous Situation of South Carolina, and also the advantages which may result from an immediate attack upon the Invaders of those States, and coupled to these, the Idea of an intended Conquest of East Florida, an event not anxiously wished for by our Ally.(2) In this view there can be no question whether the 4th Article of the Treaty of Alliance will, or will not apply.  But to solicit for such immediate relief as the Admiral may be able to afford to invaded States which are guaranteed by the Treaty is one thing-eventual proceedings and consequent benefits to the Party requiring aid in an Enterprise, is another.  If after having afforded the necessary relief in which the Parties in good faith are mutually interested, an Enterprise for acquiring new Territory should be projected, previous stipulations for compensation to the assisting Party will become necessary. I fear while we are reasoning my Country is bleeding.  A Committee had been appointed for conferring with the Commander in Chief on the most proper means for reinforcing General Lincoln, but nothing having been effected in the course of two or three days I yesterday moved for an addition of two Members and recommended my Colleagues, these Gentlemen being elected, we immediately entered upon the business committed to us.(3) The General, I mean General Washington, is of opinion that no effectual aid can be afforded from the Main Army, Count Pulaski's Legion excepted. Congress adjourned before we could make our Report and negativ'd a proposition for meeting this Morning (Sunday). Tomorrow we shall recommend to repeat the late requisitions for all possible aid to be sent from Virginia and North Carolina including about four thousand stand of Arms, a large quantity of Gunpowder, some lead &c JANUARY 31, 1779  to be collected in Maryland, and the States before mentioned. You are not to expect any Naval assistance, the Idea of granting such, from our feeble funds was generally exploded, if I remember right when the question was put on that occasion there were no voices, ay, but Mr. Drayton's and my own;(4) and truly Sir, you will not be much surprized at this, when you are fully informed of the circumstances of our Marine.  I shall be providing such Shot as Your Excellency has described, and return your Vessel if she arrives with the utmost dispatch, but, in order to save time, and for guarding against accidents which may happen to a single Vessel, I mean to recommend, indeed have recommended to send a proper Vessel with Military Stores from hence, but sorry I am to say, a question arises, have we any to spare? This shall be fully investigated tomorrow.(5) I know we have no Lead.  We have just now received very unpleasant intelligence from the West Indies, Mr. Bingham 'tis said writes from Martinico that General Grant had possessed himself of the Island of St. Lucia. Count d'Estaing having block'd up four British Ships of the Line, which were Iying in the Bason or Harbor, landed a body of Troops and attempted to force one of the Enemys works, these were severely repulsed, and the Count after having sustained a loss of upwards of fifteen hundred Men, had desisted from the Enterprise, and retired. He had been reinforced by four Ships of the Line from France, and two captured English Frigates. I have not time to enquire into particulars, but as the Account is against us, there is no ground for suspecting exaggeration.  I perused a Letter yesterday from Sir Henry Clinton to General Washington expressed in such polite terms, and intimating such an Act on the part of Sir Harry, as convinces me he wishes to be friends with us again (6)_the wretched Refugees and Rebels in New York Garrison and its environs are in the utmost distress from apprehensions of being sent across the Atlantic, or to New Providence, Georgia or Florida. They are plainly told, they must support themselves by Arms, in other words that while they remain, they must draw their subsistence from the Kings Stores as Soldiers, or from plunder in a predatory War against the Rebels. General Maxwell intimates that they were collecting in Companies, seemingly intended for the latter purpose, though with tears in their Eyes. Spain by our last intelligence, continued a bustle, and Holland grumbling. The Newspapers which will accompany this, will give Your Excellency other scraps of information. I will not further trouble you at present Sir, but to repeat, that I remain, With the highest Respect & Esteem, Your Excellencys Most Obedient And Most Humble Servant, H.L.   ""

  For the Pennsylvania Packet. Water street, Philad. Feb. 1, 1779. In a piece published in the Packet of the 31st December (1) last I called upon Brigadier Thompson to mention the affair of a private nature he alluded to, as an excuse for his unprovoked and malicious conduct towards me, for that I knew it not, and never had an angry word with him  FEBRUARY 1, 1779  in my life previous to his rude behaviour in the Coffee-house. Upwards of four weeks have elapsed, and he has not thought proper to communicate this private affair, either to the public or to myself. If he had conceived that I had affronted him on any occasion, I apprehend he should have mentioned it to me, either verbally or in writing before he did any thing farther; that gentlemen always acted this part; and that the public had nothing to do with affairs of a private nature. Agreeable to an opinion I then entertained, that he had rendered it necessary for the material parts of the transaction in Congress respecting him to be published, that the public, to whom he has appealed might have an opportunity of forming a judgment of his behaviour, and particularly of his veracity, I shall state the information given to Congress, the testimony of a few of the witnesses, his apology, and the determination of Congress thereupon. As many of the witnesses, who have been examined, were either at a distance, or came into the Coffee-house towards the conclusion of the altercation, they knew little of the matter, and therefore it will be unnecessary to take up a newspaper by inserting their evidence; but the whole of the proceedings are lodged with the printer, for the perusal of any person who may chuse to take the trouble. It may be proper to remark, that I never spoke to any of the witnesses who were examined, nor to any other gentleman, that was in the Coffee-house, to learn what he knew of this matter, nor interfered in producing any evidence whatsoever; and that it is not improbable many persons, that were not called upon, heard more than most of those who were. Before I conclude, justice to myself and a desire of a continuation of the esteem of the virtuous sons of liberty, compel me to remark, that Brigadier Thompson has asserted, \""That I refused going into a room in a tavern in this city where he and a number of other officers were, alledging that I would not sit down with a parcel of upstart Continental officers, or words to that effect.\"" The malicious design of this invented tale is obvious, and it has been circulated by his partizans, I am told, with great industry among the gentlemen of the army. As I have not been able to find out when, where or how this pretended speech should have happened, and I cannot recollect a single circumstance that could give the least foundation for it, all I can do is to deny it, declaring that I have not been in a tavern in this city, where the Brigadier was to my knowledge, for upwards of two years past. I rest assured, that those gentlemen, with whom I am acquainted, would not credit this idle story, even if I had suffered it to pass unnoticed, and those, who do not know me, after this ought not to believe it.

(1)  I must inform you, Sir, that, on the one hand, I have been repeatedly assured the representation I then made was a true one; and that, on the other hand, I have also been assured, that it was not founded on fact; and that, immediately upon this latter assurance in South Carolina, I took that step which was most likely to lead me to a certainty on the subject, with the avowed design, that if I had injured your reputation, I might be enabled to make the most ample reparation; but I did not receive the necessary materials. Those sentiments of propriety which dictated the first advance on my part then, to acquire them now dictate a like conduct when another opportunity seems to open itself for my arriving at truth, and to do that justice which the case may require. And I do assure you, that if I can be enabled to declare, that you did not violate the orders of the commander in chief, respecting your junction with him, when he had retreated to the Delaware in 1776, I shall not only do so in the most pointed terms, but beg your pardon for having, through error and misrepresentation, published the contrary.  To this purpose, I wrote to Major Eustace on the 6th of January 1778, when I was in Charlestown, and had no prospect of coming to this part of the Continent; and a copy of the correspondence between him and myself on the occasion I will lay before you, if you desire to see it.  Those principles of honour which must make you feel an injury, make me feel even an idea of having done an injury, and impels me to make a reparation where it is due.(2)  I am, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, Wm. Henry Drayton.  MS not found; reprinted from Charles Lee, Anecdotes of the Late Charles Lee, Esq., ed. Edward Langworthy (London: J.S. Jordan, 1797), pp. 49-50. First printed under the title Memoirs of the Life of the Late Charles Lee, Esq (London: J. S. Jordan, 1792).  1 The hostility between General Lee and Drayton can be traced to June 1776 when the forrner assumed command of the defense of Charleston and tactlessly scoffed at suggestions offered by Drayton for the fortification of the city. Lee's conduct in December 1776 subsequently provided Drayton the opportunity to criticize Lee's generalship, which he exploited during his delivery of a charge to the grand jury of Charleston soon thereafter.  Although Lee seized upon that incident to reopen his feud with Drayton, it seems probable that he had been moved to denounce Drayton to Richard Hutson because of the enmity William Henry had shown against him during Congress' debate on the court-martial sentence arising from Lee's behavior at the battle of Monmouth. According to Edward Langworthy, himself a participant in that debate and later the editor of Lee's papers, Drayton's conduct \""was vituperated by Lee in the severest language, because he opposed in Congress a division of the several charges brought against him, but argued and insisted upon lumping them all together, to be decided by one question.\"" Ibid., p. 48. See also John R. Alden,  FEBRUARY 3, 1779  General Charles Lee: Traitor or Patriot? (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1951), pp. 266-70; and William M. Dabney and Marion Dargan, William Henry Drayton & the American Revolution (Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 1962), pp. 154-56.  2 Lee's scathing February 5 reply to Drayton is in Anecdotes of the Late Charles Lee, pp. 50-52.

Mr Holker wished to know how the Flour deliverd for his most Christian Majesty's fleet woud be charged: whether at the Price at Boston, or the first Costs & charge of carriage?   We replied that we were confident Congress were far from Wishing to make Profit on the Supplies, & that the Account woud be settled on equitable & generous Principles.  The Minister enquired to what Exchange Congress wished the Bills of Exchange to be restricted? We first mentiond between 8 & 900 per Cent: afterwards declared that we believed it woud give satisfaction if they coud be limited at 900 per Cent. Both the Minister & Mr Holker agreed that they woud fix it on their Bills at 900 per Cent for the present; & if Circumstances required an alteration it shoud be previously mentiond to the Committee or Congress.

  Philada. Feby 3d. 1779 I this day had the pleasure of receiving your most wellcome Letter of the 1 7th of Jany.  I rejoice exceedingly to hear that you & my little Girl are in health as well as the rest of our friends at East Windsor & Windsor. There is one FEBRUARY 3, 1779  stroke in your Letter that gives me some concern, & that is that you are in low spirits. I hope this is not accasioned by my absence, or the want of any provision for your comfort [and] Happiness that it would be in my power to make was I present. I am fully sensible I have out stayed the time I talked of when I came from home; but I trust I have good reasons to justify my so doing & that you will approve of them-be assured that I have not forgot my little family, or found any other pleasures that I prefer to the enjoyment of them. Nothing but a wish to discharge the duties I owe the publick & to contribute my mite to the safety & Interest of this country could have prevailed with me to have staid so long in this City, or would be sufficient to keep me here one day longer. With great pleasure I consider my present tour of duty as drawing towards a close, & that there is a prospect of my being able in about 20 days to quit my post & return home. (1)  You will do as you please about setting up housekeeping before I come. I hardly think however I shall find you at Hartford-if I should, there will be this satisfaction attending it, that I shall find you one Hour sooner than if you stay at Windsor.  The Sattin you mention I shall with great pleasure endeavour to obtain for you. And I wish you would freely purchase any thing you have occasion for & can find at Hartford, be the price what it may-If you want money call on my brother who will be glad to furnish you with it & to render you every other service in his power.  So Mrs. Mather you tell me has a fine son. I wish her satisfaction in it, but that she may re[me]mber it is mortal-a lesson which you & I my dear have learned by sad experience. This world has now fewer charms in my eyes than it once had & I have no doubt but you can say the same. Happy for us if it keeps a better world more constantly in view; & is a means of bringing us to those joys & rest into which I fully believe our dear departed little son is already entered. I thank your good Sisters for their comp[li]ments to me & all their kindness to you and am my dear, with great truth & sincerity, your friend & humbl Servt.  Olivr. Ellsworth ""

  Sir Philad. 3d February 1779.

From a FEBRUARY 3, 1779  Desire to become a Citizen of New York he gives our State the Preference and now visits your Excellency to make the Necessary Enquiries, it being out of our Power to give him any Information. The Necessity of strengthning our Frontiers is as obvious, as the Policy of drawing the Attention of the People to that Quarter in Season. Virginia we learn has taken the Lead and already passed Laws for laying out a District of Country for Settlement, & assigning Farms for their own Soldiers, as well as those of Maryland, Delaware, and New Jersey. A Strong Predilection, however, prevails in favour of our State, on Account of its' Situation for Trade, the acknowledgd Excellency of its' Constitution, and the steady and vigorous Exertions of its' Government; Nothing, we are persuaded, will be wanting for its rapid Settlement and Cultivation but a wise and liberal System for the Distribution of the publick Land.  To you, Sir, or to our State, General Arnold can require no Recommendation. A Series of distinguished Services entitle him to Respect and Favour.

  My Dear Sir Philade Feb 6 1779 I have receivd your favor of the 21st of January. (1) Every Body sees that the Depreciation of the Paper Currency is owing to the Floods of it which have been necessarily issued. In Addition to which a great Quantity, more especially of the Emissions of 20 May 1777 & 11 April 1778 has been counterfeited. This last Consideration was a sufficient Inducement to the calling out of Circulation all the Bills of those Emissions as speedily as possible. The lessening the Quantity in Circulation is the only Means of  FEBRUARY 6, 1779  restoring the Value & Credit of the Remainder. It would therefore be a happy Event if every possessor of them would receive Loan office Certificates for them instead of new Bill in June next but this cannot be expected. In proportion as this may be done the only effectual Means, besides that of taxing which I hope will be chearfully submitted to by the People, of remedying the great Evil will have its effect. Congress have not cried down those Emissions, as the Expression is, or resolvd that the Bill should sink in the Hands of those who would not exchange them for Loan Office Certificates, as has been done in the Eastern States. This might have been to[o] harsh a Remedy. They have left it in the Option of the Possessors to receive either such Certificates or new Bills. This is the obvious Intention of their Resolutions on the Subject. The Wish of every discerning honest Man must be as obvious, viz that as many of the Bills may sink in the Loan offices as the People can possibly spare, and as soon as possible. I think therefore you have judgd right of their Views. It would be an Act of Charity and a great Service to the publick if those who can afford to put their Money to Interest would ease their poorer fellow Citizens who are possessed of those Bills, by exchanging them for other Bills without a Discount.

York was delivered to another Member of that State, from the hint you gave of yr Intention to furnish the President. This to remind you we pray excuse. Yrs,  D.

These officials had opened their assault on Arnold with the single charge that he had used public wagons for transporting privately owned goods from which he profited, but they quickly expanded their attack, adding seven charges to the original complaint lodged with Congress on January 25 and ordering them printed and circulated to the states. To give even wider publicity to Arnold's offenses, they also ordered, on February 8, \""That the Resolves of this Council of the 3d instant, respecting Gen'l Arnold, be published in the several Newspapers of this City.\"" See Pennsylvania Packet, February 9, 1779; Pa.

  My Dear Sir, Philadelphia 7th Feby 1779 I thank you for the information contained in Your favor of 24th Decr. last which is the last letter I have received from you. (1) Col. Beadle's Regiment is dismiss'd.(2) I need not inform you of the difficulty of procuring a just enquiry into the conduct of an Officer at a distance from the Army, this I suppose occasion'd the act of Congress impowering the executive authority of the several States for that purpose.(3) I wish it was done by N.H. in this instance, I have no doubt there has been great abuses commited in that country, & I know of no power so competent to investigate the true state of matters there as the executive authority of the State.  The plan of finance has reached you I suppose some time ago, You'll observe the Quota of N.H. is not so high in proportion as last Year. I procured this abatement not because I thought the sum more than the state would be able to raise but because You might be more at liberty to act Your discretion, however I hope you will raise a much larger sum, as you will be allowed interest for all you raise above Your just proportion & there can be no better time to collect money than when it is plenty. I hope some other method will be divised to help our Currency, what is already done can be nothing more than mere palliatives  The transactions relative to the British Commission &c are not yet finished. I shall do myself the pleasure of sending them to you as soon as they come from the press.(4) I have inquired of the Jersey Gentn respecting the man you mention, and they know of no such person.(5) I think it very probable he is an imposture and ought at least to be well watched. The  FEBRUARY 7, 1779  speech of the Foolish Tyrant of Britain will shew that his mettle is much lowered, it must be very humiliating to ask the Mediation of Spain & meet with a refusal.  It is reported, but not from so good authority as I cod wish, that Spain has a fleet of 44 sail of the line besides Frigates &c in Cadiz Bay, & are speedily to be join'd by 10 more from Ferool & Cathergena, if this shod be true they certainly are meditating some important stroke.  The success of the Enemy to the Southward will give them Spirits, they have got possession of Georgia & our Friends from Carolina are not free from apprehension that Charlestown is in danger, the People from N. Carolina & Virginia are marching to the assistance of their Neighbours with great spirit and I hope will frustrate their (the Enemies) designs.  John D___n (6) is chosen to represent Delaware in C__ but has not yet taken his seat, that State hath acceeded to the Confederacy. There now only remains Maryland who you know has seldom done any thing with a good Grace, She has always been a froward hussey. It is a misfortune that such differences shod take place between our Commissioners but it is not to be wondered at, that the watchfulness of A.L.(7) shod draw on him the enmity of those who are utter strangers to the feelings of Patriotism that influence that Gentns Conduct; however, I need not trouble you with my opinion of those Characters, you are well acquainted with them.I well remember your opinion of a certain Person (8) (now in this City) early in 76 before his departure from America, it wod have been fortunate for this Country if others had entertain'd the same opinion of him then that you did, but he was then, as he now is, supported by characters who will never suffer Martyrdom for the cause of Virtue.  Europe is now full of negotiations which it may be expected will reach America in the spring, when probably we may be entertained with a new set of proposals from Britain, tho' I can hardly think her vain enough to entertain even an Idea of any thing short of Independence, even that, in my judgment, ought not to satisfy us, unless she will quit all pretensions to Canada & Nova Scocia, as for the Floridas I think we may consent to divide that Country with Spain if she will furnish us with funds to sink our paper money. Whatever may be the result of negotiations we must prepare for another vigorous Campaign for which purpose I hope every exertion will be used to recruit the Army. New Hampshire I am confident will not be backward in this respect.  Please to present my Respects to all Friends in Your circle, I have been weekly expecting to be favoured with a line from some of them. Coll Peabody promised me he would write to me, & I did expect Dr Thompson & Genl Folsom wod have done me that Honour. You know the rule that You & I settled is that he that stays at home should commence the correspondence. (9)  I am very Sincerely Yours &c &c, W.W. [P.S.] If I was accustmed to make apologies this scrawl wod need one.  ""

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia 8th Feb'y 1779.  Inclosed in a Letter of this day you will receive from me an Act of Congress requesting Connecticut & New York to afford a Supply of Provisions to the Inhabitants of the State of Rhode-Island who are said to be in great distress for want of Bread. (1) FEBRUARY 8, 1779  This is a Subject which in my Opinion is to be treated with great delicacy. New York has credit for her Exertions to supply the army & the exhausted State of her resources is known. It is nevertheless hoped that she may be able to give some Releif to her starving Sister, & every motive of humanity & policy will advise it if practicable. Care however ought to be taken of our own Inhabitants, and the Releif, if afforded, should be so regulated as to prevent that amazing Exportation, & intolerable Rise in the price of Provision, which would follow an incautious tho' partial Refusal of the Embargo. Nor would it, I think, be wise to go into any measures in consequence of this recommendation without having previously consulted with the Commissary General, as well as with Connecticut; with the former, on the State of his Magazines, with the latter on the Subject of a joint plan. Unless there be an overplus to be spared from the Necessities of the army, & the Consumption of the Inhabitants all ought to be retained. If there be an Overplus in both States, would it be amiss for the Commissary to purchase & collect it at the Expence of Rhode-Island, & let the Government of that State cause it to be transported, and provide for its due distribution. The Poor of that State will otherwise be at the mercy of Engrossers, and, like the wretched Egyptians, under the vicegerency of Joseph, be obliged to give their hand for corn. I am, Dear Sir, Your Friend & Servant, John Jay.  Reprinted from Clinton, Papers (Hastings), 4:552-53.  1 For Governor Clinton's letter of February 18 to the New York legislature enclosing the \""Act of Congress\"" referred to here by Jay, see ibid., p. 580.

Having no Arguments to offer but such as I must derive from reason and Experience, I will not venture to offer any. Such you will, no doubt, deem frivolous when Opposed to yours which are drawn from Sources so far transcendant. I must submit to the Convictions my mind derives from the only means of Information which Heaven has been pleased to give me, until God, in his good pleasure, shall give me clearer light. And until such period shall arrive I Shall not deem myself worthy to approach your purity. I must submit, tho very reluctantly, to forego the pleasure of your acquaintance and Conversation, Since Such is your wish-but I shall never cease to wish thee all possible happiness here and hereafter; nor shall I ever lose the pleasing remembrance that you once deemed me not entirely unworthy of your benevolent regard.  I consider my self now as taking my last farewell of a Lady for whom I entertain the most affectionate Esteem; and I feel myself too sensibly affected by this Circumstance to admit of one lively thought.

  Doctor William Read (1) 9th February [1779] I had the honor of writing to you on the 3d or 4th Inst.(2) by Colonel John Laurens to whose special attention I recommended the dispatch. I have learned nothing very material respecting Georgia affairs in addition to the advices contained in that Letter. I am told General Nelson from Virginia has generously step'd forth and headed the troops from that State going to the relief of South Carolina and Georgia, the number not mentioned. His presence and example will encourage hundreds to march, who otherwise would have remain'd at home-near three thousand Men from North Carolina had arrived at Charlestown, badly armed or without arms. The Enemy have obvious and very great advantages over us which they are well apprised of, and will practice to our very great distress. Georgia will be gleaned of every grain of Rice, Corn &c every pound of Indigo, all her Cattle, Horses and other live Stock-of all her Cannons, Military and other Stores, of thousands of Negroes, and according to the humour or orders of the Enemy her surface may also be cleared of every Building-all this may be done in spite of our efforts, and a safe retreat to St Augustine effected, either by Land or Water. But when I reflect on the Auxiliary forces of Savages and disaffected Persons it appears probable that the Conquerors will keep their footing.  In my last I intimated a design of paying a visit to New Jersey, probably to Brunswick. I still hold my purpose therefore I shall only add that you are welcome to draw on me for so much money as your circumstances require, had you named a particular sum I would have sent it by Mr. Clarkson. I shall reserve other subjects for conversation when we meet or for a future Letter, in case of my going directly for South Carolina.

We seized the very first opportunity that offer'd after the receipt of your letter, set forth the distressed situation of our brethren, and moved Congress in the terms specified by you. The vote of the Assembly ought to have been inclosed to us. The motion was committed, together with an application from Massachusetts-Bay desiring a recommendation to the southern States to take of[f] their embargoes. On the motion from Rhode Island the committee reported the inclosed Resolution; (1) the report on the Massa. Application was recommitted. In that report our State was included. (2) We could have wished and exerted ourselves to obtain the repeal you desired; but the scarcity of Provision in New-York & Connecticut is so  FEBRUARY 9, 1779  great, the demands of the army so pressing, and the apprehensions of monopolizing so terrible, that we could not accomplish it.-We hope that what we have effected will afford some relief to our wretched inhabitants. The President hath wrote to those States;(3) so that a speedy application will not be too early.  The inclosed Paper will give your excellency the Speech of the King of Great-Britain. (4) An address was moved of course, which occasioned a spirited debate. From a paper put into W.A.'s (5) hands this morning he made some short minutes which may convey entertainment and perhaps instruction. Mr. Fox charged the Speech with falsehood, was pointed & severe on the conduct of the ministry. Mr. Townsend moved as an amendment, that his majesty would remove the present ministry. Govr. Johnstone thought it necessary to support 25,000 men in America, if they meant only to carry on a defensive war, and retain their possessions; declared that the ministry had ruined the effects of the commission by the most unparallelled Impotence. Lord North said it was time to take our ground and vigorously exert ourselves to punish the perfidy of our malignant enemy and reduced the claims of our revolted subjects. The majorities were as usual.  Lord North may take his ground &c as soon as he pleases. We have nothing to fear.

Vessels have been freighted to Boston from hence for one quarter of what they can carry, each party risking his own property-in this case the vessels have loaded wholly with flour-whether there ought to be any difference with iron you will judge. I have lately heard vessels cannot be had at Boston on those terms; however of that you will also judge at any rate I think it will be better to take them on a share than pay a certain freight and insure the vessel. For news I must refer you to the papers-the European powers are busy with negotiations-it is very probable proposals from Britain will reach us in the Spring-she will not have vanity enough to make them but on the principles of Independence, but will she give up the Sovereignty of Canada and Nova Scotia, that will stick in her stomach, but she must swallow it. Are you willing to share the Floridas with Spain on condition of her furnishing us with funds to sink our paper money? Perhaps France and Russia may settle the dispute between the Emperor and the King of Prussia-all these events are in the womb of fate but the general struggles may bring them forth shortly.  Adieu yours, W.W.  ""

  Sir,(1) Philada. 10th Feb. 1779 Hard as it is to get a Line from you in the Chit Chat way I do not dispair of obtaining one in a point of serious friendship.  The Letters of Mrs. L___ (2) and Mr. Bells Conversation as well as that of less intelligent Persons and the Manners of People here convince me that while I burn candles here till morning drudging in addition to what the Labors of the day continually are, I am only earning a Debt which will be a Load on my Shoulders here after without any certain or probable Views of liquidation. I find £200 Rent demanded instead of 60. Mr Avery with his small Family spends in Bread 150, what will my many mouths demand? Those two Articles with a p. of Linnen and one Suit of Cloaths, for myself amount to the whole annual Allowance made me. Whence then Wood, Cloathing, Meat-&c. for my Family? Is it decent, nay is it not base in me to know how much my dearest Connections are a Burthen upon the Generosity of munificent private Persons, and not endeavour to put an end to it. I cannot be understood to drop herein the least hint against the Public, I mean Government, tho I am willing to have any Construction put upon my Words as respecting the Majority of the People, who make only a pretence of the Quantity of money to open the Floodgates of Extortion. I am honored highly honored by an Election, I am flattered for my Industry and I am praised & rewarded by my Conscience; but still I must look beyond my Self to Wife & Children.  Every Allowance is & will be made to me that is made to my Colleagues. Hundreds of worthy Men would take my Place. The Public cannot therefore be in any measure justified in a Thought of maintaining a Tribe where a Bachelor or a Man of Fortune would freely supply a Vacancy.  I grow daily more and more easy respecting our Cause, it is almost out of the Reach of our open Foes or domestic lurking villainus Enemies. I cannot justify myself to write largely to you on this Head being under singular Injunctions tho not individually approving them. But Providence is turning great Wheels for us. You may almost venture to believe any favorable Paragraphs in the Gazettes whatever. You will have Arrivals shortly that will put our mimic Secresy at Ridicule. But to return to my important Self. I have sent to our Council an Acceptance of the Honor done me.(3) How shall I so soon signify the contrary? I suppose in a month or two those matters will be arranged here in which I have been by accident judged to be a most essential Agent. If I could then return home to the most menial Situation I think I have not pride enough to be  FEBRUARY 10, 1779  choaked at the Reversal. I really think I am chargeable with Indecency to the Public to continue in a Station such as the present when I see for a demonstrable Certainty that the Delegates Children must go Barefoot. Whereas the Lemmon Seller's may ride in a Chariot. Grant that even the Latter are barefoot, the Contrast of Nakedness and Honorable Station is not superadded to mortify the Parents mind.  Here you have it, Sir, wildly expressed and worse written. Counsel me, and point out something of an Income to meet me at my Resignation. Remember that I have lived eleven days on Bread & Water.(4) I am sure I could stand it longer than that out of Prison; and my Example would make it bearable to my Boys. I cannot return, out of place, to visit and be visited with any means of Support: but be assured, little would be better than knowing as I said before that I am earning Debt, which the Porter is not.  I shall not pretend to deny that I am in the Dumps or as Doctr. Jos Gardner says \""have got the Horrors.\""  I fancy I am already better than when I began to write. I feel relieved in the Certainty that you will invent Something of Employ for me.  Pray excuse me to Doctr. Cooper. I promised to answer his kind Letters but it is absolutely impossible now. I could not tell him more than I have hinted to you.  We shall be free I hope in addition to our Independence, and out of debt speedily after this War is once over.  What under the Heavens is the Reason that our State has not sent for Flour instead of giving Certificates to good Men who will only bate 6d a Barrel of what Villians demand of the distressed Inhabitants. If good Individuals of New-England may be favored why not good Individuals of the middle & Southern States? There are some pious Merchants this Way that would bate the Bostonians twice 6d I verily believe.  I shall foolishly scribble till I lose the Post. Your very humb Sert. James Lovell  ""

  Gentlemen February 10th 1779 We have your favours of the 9th 16th & 25th december, 6th, 13th, 15th, 21st & 27th ultimo,(1) which at present we have not time to answer, but we shall shortly consider their Contents and reply to such parts as may be necessary. FEBRUARY 10, 1779  In consequence of your last letter of the 27th and the letter Inclosed therein from Governor Trumbull we have Ordered Captain Harding in the Confederacy to join the State Ships in the proposed attack upon the enemies Vessels in the Western sound, and have allowed ten days after the sailing of his Ship from New London harbour for compleating that expedition, and if not done in that time he has our Instructions to proceed without delay on a Cruize upon the Coast to the southward, or sooner should the expedition be accomplished. We hope you have taken due Care to have that ship properly victualled and fitted for a long Cruize. We send you enclosed herein Coppies of our Letters to Governor Trumbull and of our Orders to Captains Harding & Olney (2)-the latter we have ordered to Cruize to the southward. We expect by the time this gets to hand that the ship Ranger will be compleated for the Sea-if so-or as soon after as she can be made ready we desire you will send her on a Cruize upon the Coast to the southward with Orders to join (if possible) the Deane, Queen of France & Confederacy and to Cruize in Company with those Ships.  We doubt not your most vigourous exertions are employed in preparing for Sea the Other Ships in the Port of Boston we have little hopes that they can be all manned shortly & would suggest to you the propriety of putting the men engaged with the Other Ships on board that Ship which has the best prospect of being first manned and by that means compleating her complement. Should you adopt this plan, you will do it in the best manner so as to keep the Seamen in good humour. We shall shortly again write to you respecting our Instructions with regard to the employment of the Ships you are now fitting out, in the mean time you will keep us constantly advised of their condition and the expectations you have of compleating them-we request you will acquaint us with the state of the Ship building at Portsmouth in New Hampshire.  We have given Orders for purchasing a quantity of Flour & Iron for the use of your Department, and desire that you will procure five small fast Sailing Vessels-three of which you will Order to Baltimore and two to this place for the purpose of transporting this Flour and Iron to the Eastward. Two of these Cargos will be wanted in New Hampshire, it may therefore be proper to direct the Agent at Portsmouth to send two Vessels from thence, more especially as probably vessels may be procured on better terms there than at Boston. If there are any vessels belonging to the Public that are suitable for this Service it will be best to employ them. Those that go to Baltimore must be addressed to William Smith Esqr. You will duely advise us of the sailing of these Vessels and their burthen. There now remains at Senepuxent of what was formerly purchased for your Department 180 barrels flour and 542 bar, or about 7 1/2 Tons Iron. You will please to procure and send a proper fast Sailing vessel to that place to transport the same to your port. We are Gentlemen,  Your Hble servants  P.S. We shall very shortly send you more money and most earnestly urge your sending an Account of your expenditures with all possible speed.  ""

We expect you are victualled and equiped for A Long Cruize and if the Object the governor has in veiw is not accomplished in ten days after your sailing from New London, you are to hold yourself no longer bound by his Orders, and if the business is done in less time than ten days you will immediately afterwards proceed to Sea and govern yourself by the following Instructions.

  Sir(1) February 10th. 1779 You are to sail immediately upon the receipt of these Orders Instructions unless there be powerful reasons to the contrary, and sweep in the first place this coast from the Southward of Cape May to the Bar of Charles Town, and afterwards to Cruize in such Latitudes and Longitudes which are best calculated to give the greatest aid and protection to the Trade of Delaware, Chesapeake and Charles Town, and as often as circumstances and the safety of your Ships will admit of it, you are to enter the mouths of Delaware & Chesapeake for the purpose of destroying the small Armed Vessels from New York that lurk about the Capes to the certain destruction of almost every Merchantman that sails. You are at the same time to be extreamly cautious in continuing in any of these places so long as to render yourself a certain Object for the pursuit of the enemy. If in the Course of this Cruize you should meet with the Deane or FEBRUARY 10, 1779  the Confederacy or both of them it is our orders, that you and they proceed on this Cruize in Company under the command of the Superior Officer to execute these Orders, and least you should be seperated by Storms or other circumstances, it would be advisable to establish such Private Signals that when the Ships meet again they may be known to each Other as friends.  The great delay expence and trouble in manning the Ships for Sea has induced this Committee to direct and Order you, to continue this Cruize as long as your Provisions and other circumstances will admit. As soon as you meet with the Deane or the Confederacy, you will give the Captains of these Ships a Copy of these Instructions, for the government of their conduct.  The superiority of the Naval force of the enemy on this Coast and the misfortunes that have heretofore happened to some of our ships, will we trust make you extreamly vigilant and active-the confidence we repose in your fidelity courage and good conduct, gives us every reason to hope for a successful Cruize. Most of the Armed Vessels from New York are inferior in force to yourself, which will put it in your power to aid the Trade of the Southern States by destroying many of them and thereby to render not only essential service to the Public, but to add to the honor and reputation of your own character.  You are to keep these Instructions a profound secret, and when the state of your Provisions requires, you will return into the Port of Philadelphia or some convenient One in the Bay of Cheseapeake from whence you are to give the earliest intelligence of your Arrival to this Committee.  We wish you success and are Sir, Your Hble servants  ""

  My dear Sir Philade Feb 11, 1779 Will you be so kind as to present my due Regards to Mrs Warren and let her know that immediately upon my receiving her Letter for Miss  FEBRUARY 1 1, 1779  Wray I deliverd it to the Care of my worthy Friend Coll Laurens who has since informd me that he has forwarded it in his own Packett to South Carolina.  I have lately written several Letters to my Friend Dr C,(1) and have informd him that you & He and Mr S P Savage are my only confidential Correspondents in Boston. I have other trusty Friends but I have not Leisure to write to them all. I have expressd my wish to him that the honest and virtuous Friends of our Country wd cultivate a cordial Esteem for each other. I am affraid there are little Jealousies among them which prevent their uniting their Councils and Efforts against that Inundation of Levity, Vanity, Luxury, Dissipation and indeed Vice of every Kind, which I am informd threatens that Country which has heretofore stood with almost unexampled Firmness in the Cause of Liberty and Virtue. This Torrent must be stemmed, and in order to do it effectually there must be Associations of Men of unshaken Fortitude. A general Dissolution of Principles & Manners will more surely overthrow the Liberties of America than the whole Force of the common Enemy. While the People are virtuous they cannot be subdued; but when once they lose their Virtue, they will be ready to surrender their Liberties to the first external or internal Invader. How necessary then is it for those who are determind to transmit the Blessings of Liberty as a fair Inheritance to Posterity, to associate on publick Principles in Support of publick Virtue. I do verily believe, and I may say it inter Nos, that the Principles and Manners of New England, producd that Spirit which finally has establishd the Independence of America; and Nothing but opposite Principles & Manners can overthrow it. If you are of my Mind, and I think you are, the Necessity of supporting the Education of our Country must be strongly impressd on your Mind. It gives me the greatest Concern to hear that some of our Gentlemen in the Country begin to think the Maintenance of Schools a great Burden. I wish they could hear the Encomiums that are given to New England by some of the most sensible and publick spirited Gentlemen in the Southern States for the Care and Expence which have been freely borne by our Ancestors & continued to this time for the Instruction of Youth. Virginia is duly sensible of the great Importance of Education, and, as a Friend in that Country informs me, has lately adopted an effectual Plan for that necessary Purpose. If Virtue and Knowledge are diffusd among the People, they will never be enslavd. This will be their great Security. Virtue and Knowledge will forever be an over Balance to Powers and Riches. I hope our Countrymen will never depart from the Principles and Maxims which have been handed down to us from our wise forefathers. This greatly depends upon the Example of Men of Character & Influence of the present Time. This is a Subject my Heart is much set upon. But I fear I have wearied your Patience. I will conclude with my most ardent Prayer, that our last Days may be our best Days and our last  Works our best Works. Adieu, my dear Friend, S.A. FEBRUARY 11, 1779  [P.S.] Pay my due Regards to your Circle in Plymouth. Are you acquainted with Mr D?(2) I mentiond him to you in a former Letter as an excellent Republican & recommended him warmly to your Friendship.  ""

  Philadelphia May it please your Excellency. Feby. 11th, 1779. Your first enquiry, we presume will be, how goes on Confederation? We have the pleasure to inform you that Jersey and Deleware have acceded- and Maryland alone stands out-her reasons for it we enclose to you, and whether we shall send to all the States for their consent to a Confederation of twelve, or wait for Maryland to consider better of it, and acceed, will be the most expeditious, and prudent method of bringing this important business to a close, is the question.  Recruiting, providing for, arranging and paying the Army, have long engaged the attention of Congress. These are all important objects, & notwithstanding the present deranged state of our foreign affairs, and internal resources, and the reduced condition of our finances, we hope and trust that such wise measures will be adopted and supported by the united exertions of the several States as, will through the smiles of Heaven, put them upon a firm and respectable footing. The Committee appointed to confer with Gen. Washington on this business have prepared a number of resolutions to lay before Congress, which when passed, we shall embrace the earliest opportunity to transmit to your Excellency.  The Resolution passed upon the Representation from the State of Rhode Island, of their inhabitants being likely to famish, through the operation of the land embargo in Connecticut, has been transmitted by the President. (1)  Although Mr Dean has long since been heard on his agency abroad, yet his affairs remain undecided upon-a Committee is appointed to look through them, in order to bring them to a proper and speedy issue.  The misunderstanding which subsisted amongst our Commissioners when abroad, & the unfavorable insinuations given respecting the merit of each other, have excited (to say no more) the caution of Congress, at least of many of the members in regard to their transactions abroad. Mr Dean's publication & the reply of Common Sense, particularly that part which asserted that he had in his hands a letter, which shewed that the supplies Mr Dean so pompously plumed himself upon-were all promised and engaged, and that as a present, before his arrival in France &c proved a FEBRUARY 11, 1779  source of great embarrassment and difficulty-alarmed the French Embassador for the interest and reputation of his Court, which he considered would be disagreably affected thereby-he remonstrated to Congress on the subject, who passed a Resolve that those supplies were received in the way of trade, and not as a present from the Court of France.  We doubt not but it will appear that Mr Dean has done much for, & deserved much of his Country, and that he will be properly considered.  The King's speech with debates in Parliament as far as they have come to hand-the latest advices from the Southward and West Indies-& the unhappy controversy that has arisen between the President and Council of this State & Genl. Arnold are contained in the enclosed News papers, to which we refer you. The rate of exchange for bills on France, as sold by Mr Holker, their Agent, is £900 Continental money for £100 Sterling. Authentic intelligence has been recd in Congress from Europe, of high importance & in appearance far from being unfavorable to America, which we are not at liberty to communicate at present.  With the highest esteem & respect-We have the honor to be Your Excellency's most obedient & most hble. Servts  Elipht Dyer.  Oliver Ellsworth.  Jesse Root ""

  My dear Brother, Freestone point Virginia Feby.11,1779 (1) I As well as the shortness of my time will permit, I will give you the best detail in my power of things here since I wrote you fully by the Marquis Fayette of the state of our politics and parties.(2) The wicked intrigues which you experienced from a certain set, and of which you have so often and justly complained, have been practiced here to a still greater and more extensive mischievous length. The Tories avail themselves of it, and they are to a Man [on] Deane's side, hoping thereby to injure and deprive us of influence whose deterrnined will and capacity to injure their cause they well know and fear. Deane's party in short rests on triple ground. FEBRUARY 11, 1779  The first and most considerable is Toryism, the second and next most considerable is Commercial plunder, the third is Ambition. These last are few in number, but artful, intriguing, and want now, when our affairs look well, to come into yours & our b.(3) Williams places, which they would not have dared even to have accepted before the late happy change of our affairs, by the Alliance with France. Soon after I wrote by Marquis Fayette I left Philadelphia the 3d of Novr. having been between 6 and 7 months from my family and quite worn down with constant attention to public business. As I came [. . .] up to Congress where he (4) has been ever since. After I came away a month, Deane published his Libel of Decr. 5 as you see in one of the papers now sent. The bold and impudent assertions, the dark inuendos, and the art with which the whole is wrought up, had it seems such an effect in Phila. as to excite Tumults there in his favor. And to the Southward here, it had very ill, tho not such violent effects, because there are fewer Tories here to aid its operation. In the enemies quarters the City of N. York it created the most extravagant joy and underwent republication. These Intriguers who are wickedly working their own private benefit, do infinitely more injury to the common cause than all the power of our enemy can effect. Before they came here our business was going on with unanimity and with wisdom, since their arrival discord and faction have reared their baneful heads to the unimaginable injury of our affairs. The affair of Berkenhout, on which this Libeller has insinuated evil against me was the most trifling of all things. The man was a perfect Stranger to me, and came to me solely on the ground of a former acquaintance with my brother. I received him civilly, and he told me he came to seek a settlemen[t] for his family, and asked my advice where he shd. fix. I gave him the best advice I could. He appeared to me most strongly attached to the independence of America, and I did and do believe him to have been honestly so. I do not think we changed above an hundred words together, for I was too much engaged in pub. business. He was arrested on no other ground than a paragraph in an English Newspaper. After this I never saw him. Having detained him in prison a few days they discharged and sent him back to N. York having no evidence to prove anything against him. This is the whole of that affair.(5) The wicked fallacies against you and our b. Wm. you both know. The greater part I know to be abominably false. Deane has since given in a written narrative to Congress in which I am informed his only charges against you are that you are jealous, suspicious, affrontive to all who come near you, that you hate the french, and show it in all your conduct and conversation. Mr. Wm. Lee is mean he says and goes shares with the Agents he has appointed. This latter charge I presume Mr. Lee can, and I hope he will furnish to Congress the most ample disproof of. The charges against you in his Narrative to Congress are absolute jargon the greatest part of them. His printed libel against you, it may be highly proper to attend to in every part & get the clearest proof of falsehood where the nature of the thing admits. For in many cases, he deals so in inuendo, that a kind of negative   proof, impossible to be produced, can alone refute him. For too many people are inconsiderate enough not to demand proof of him for such charges before they credit them. He & his party are now working to get him to Holland and themselves in your places. What may be their success God only knows. I am now on my way to Congress having been long detained at home by excessive bad weather and the Gout. Deane affirmed to Congress upon his honor that he was not engaged in Trade, nor had been except in two small ventures at first which turned out to loss. It might be very important to have his commercial connections clearly developed and proved. I have sent to the Virginia Press the other day a vindication of you & our b. Wm. against Deane's Libel wherein I have disproved some of his charges from original letters. I hope this will have a good effect. All sensible Whigs in this Country, and now the herd of Mankind, begin to see clearly into Deane & his party. But he has a very strong and a very Artful party in {Congress}(6) and by means of commercial connections a considerable {party} in almost every {state}. In the eastern States where he is well known he has by far the fewest supporters. Indeed he has very few there. Those people are wise, attentive, sober diligent & frugal, which are qualities not fit for Deanes purposes. His principal {abettor}s are from {New York} and some [. . .]nd from Pen a and almost all from {Maryland}. For which purpose [you] may imagine C-r 1 {was sent} to {Congress}.(7) It does not [app]ear to me that the publications of Common Sense in Deanes affair merited all that high resentment shewn to it. The honest writer had in view to disrobe Deane of the gaudy vest he had assumed as being the sole author and procurer of all the Supplies that came here in 1777. But you see that under this it has been so contrived as to get a general condemnation of all his publications on this subject. Altho the far greater part relates solely to Deane, and many honest truths are told and properly pressed. It wounded the party very deeply I fancy, and there was no other way to prevent the public effects it would certainly have had otherwise, And will yet in a great degree, for I am informed that the people here do by no means agree with Congress in their general condemnation of these papers. As for the noise about its being said that the United States might make treaty with England with[ou]t the consent of their Ally if war was not declared-I do not believe that any one Man of sense, or member ever said or thought anything like it. Tis mere pretense. For myself I know that I would sooner cease to live than I would agree in any manner or for any pretext to desert our Ally for whom I feel infinite gratitude and reverence. You know perfectly well how long and how ardently my Soul has panted after this connection with France. Perhaps there was not another man in America so enthusiastically strenuous for the measure as myself. Indeed as Shandy says it was my Hobby Horse. And now a pack of rascals would insinuate (for their private purposes) that I would injure the measure I have been so uniformly and so warmly promoting. Two days ago I recd. your letters of 6 & 29th Septr. & 14 Novr. & our brothers of 15 & 21 of October. That  is one copy of each. I understood there are letters for me from you both at Philadelphia with F. L. L. I have not time now to write to Mr. Wm. Lee. Therefore I pray you to give him the contents of this letter, and tell him we will consider maturely about selling his estate. I do not think it will now be done. We have not yet indeed received his powers-[. . .] continues. He has put about 2200 pounds of our brothers money in the Loan Office. The Tobo. of last year is not yet sold. The Loan Office certificates are transferable and do pass in circulation. They [are a] very vendible commodity. The pub pays the principal in 3 years and t[he] interest of 6 pr. Cent annually. But a tax in our State takes off one pr. Cent on the interest both in the Loan Office & all other interest. I will write again by the first opportunity, but I could not omit this, which I believe to be a good one, as Capt. Robinson is a most worthy Man, and is a Captain in the Continental Navy. We are filling up our Regiments and preparing for another Campaign. We hear that since the repulse at St. Lucia, the Count D 'Estaing has been reenforced and has retaken St. Lucia & taken St. Vincents with four English Frigates. I believe and hope this is true. Admiral Byron has been so long sailed with 9 ships, tis sa[id] for the W. Indies, and not heard of that we begin to entertain h[opes] that some of these high gales of wind, that have been so frequent within these 4 months past, have done his business for him. God of his infinite mercy grant it may be so. Nothing could save the common cause so much as stopping these abominable intrigues and factions here. And as Mr. {Gerard} has much (influence with} the {intriguers}(8) if [they] were {instruct}ed to {discontinue} it, a very happy consequence wd. f[ollow].  For my part, I see so clearly that the Man who serves the public honestly has so many enemies and persecutors, and I am so worn down in the public service that I am resolved to send my resignation to our Assembly next April. My family suffers immensely by my absence, and I have now 7 children and another coming to take care of. Let Ludwell come as soon as you think him qualified to pu[rsue] here the study of the practical part of the Attorneys business and to in[form] himself of the Municipal law of this State-I mean when his foun[datio]n is well laid. Propose to my brother Wm. to send Thom, if he approves and thinks the expence will be warranted by the prospects, to settle an acquaintance in Holland & the ports of France, perhaps Spain, so as to get consignments when he returns here qualified, which I wish may be soon as possible. He should be impressed before he goes on such a Tour, if he does go, with the necessity of much gravity, sobriety, and attention to business wherever he is-And to take Memorandums of their Trading customs wherever he goes.  I am most affectionately and faith[fully] yours.  R.H.L. P.S. Take all imaginable pains effectually to vindicate your own char[acter].  It would be of infinite consequence to get the Dutch into our Alliance and the acknowledgment of our Independence.

I think the Paymaster might remain for that purpose and another appointed pro tempore; but we move no faster than we would do if the Southern States were in perfect peace and safety.

  Dear General Feb. 12th. 1779 I never think of your Situation but it puts me into a State of Mind very unfit for writing to you. The unprovided Situation of the Department in which you command was always in my Expectation;(1) notwithstanding what I heard said to the contrary. All our movements are months too late. Had you been on the Spot to have reconciled contending Interests among the People of the two invaded States before the foreign Enemy arrived you might have so checked the first Invaders that they would not have been able to cooperate as now with the Troops from New York. But, why should I now talk of Ifs. What is to be done as Matters now are? I think you are not in a Condition to do much if any thing for Georgia the Enemy having such Facility of transporting themselves to your Rear and injuring Carolina in your Absence. I am astonished that Water craft have not been provided by that Government in abundance. You must take up the Practice of a more eastern General than yourse[l]f call largely for Men & Stores, and in case you are not well;supplied with both, you know where FEBRUARY 12, 1779  to shroud your Reputation.

This has delayed a Settlement of the Quotas, but it must absolutely be determined in a day or two.

  W. H. D. to the KING of GREAT-BRITAIN. Sir, Philadelphia, February 13th, 1779.  Your royal voice to your Parliament, on the 27th of November last, has at length reached the ears of Freemen on the western shore of the Atlan- FEBRUARY 13, 1779  tic: (1) And, those Freemen are convinced, it is a sound very different from the roaring of a Lion, when Lashing his nervous tail, and bristling his shaggy mane, he means to display the \""most active exertions,\"" \""against all his enemies.\"" Accustomed, Sir, as you have been, to have your most gracious speeches most humbly echoed back to your flattered ear; it is time that you should receive the observations of Freemen. As a Freeman, I therefore take the liberty, Royal Sir, to give my sentiments upon your late speech to your Parliament.  You begin with telling them, that \""you have called them together in a conjuncture which demands their most serious attention.\"" But, as that most serious attention was, by the necessity of your affairs, always demanded, as often as you have called this Parliament together, to what purpose has your Majesty now pronounced an entire sentence, in which there is nothing new, but its existence; and in which there is nothing instructive or informing? Without doubt, it was to convince them by your first words, that you did not intend to say any thing of importance: and, your Majesty's speech well warrants this conclusion from its first sentence.  The speech proceeds-\""In the time of profound peace, without pretence of provocation or color of complaint, the Court of France hath not forborne to disturb the public tranquility, in violation of the faith of treaties, and the general rights of sovereigns, at first, by the clandestine supply of arms to my revolted subjects in North-America; afterwards, by avowing openly their support, and entering into formal engagements with the leaders of the rebellion, and, at length, by committing open hostilities and depredations on my faithful subjects, and by an actual invasion of my dominions.\"" Permit me, Sir, to consider these positions separately.  When a war actually existed between America and Great-Britain, and of such a nature too, as interested all the world in its consequences, and particularly France; and, when at the same time, the Imperial and Prussian forces had actually taken the field, and all Europe was arming by sea and land; to call such a time, a \""time of profound peace,\"" is certainly not to speak so as to be understood-nay, it is absolutely to misrepresent the fact. But, I will give the conjuncture its proper description, and examine in what light your Majesty's complaint will then stand. According to such description it will stand thus.  In a time of a dangerous war, which I had commenced; and which, in its consequences, involved the interests, and if I succeeded, threatened the very safety of France, that Court authorised by the law of nations and the general rights of sovereigns to take measures for her security, without pretence of provocation, or colour of complaint, hath not forborne to disturb the public tranquility, by, among other acts and doings, committing open hostilities and depredations on my faithful subjects, and by an actual invasion of my dominions.  Now, Sir, admitting such hostilities, depredations and invasion to be true, yet, they being made in the conjuncture I have accurately described they certainly were not committed without pretence of provocation, or colour of   complaint, as your Majesty asserts they were: nor, in violation of the faith of treaties, and the general rights of sovereigns. For, in the first place, your Majesty had kindled and was then actually prosecuting a dangerous war, which put the safety of France, or at least her interests at hazard. Secondly, no treaty which you had formed with France, forbad her to take measures against that hazard. Thirdly, France by taking such measures, and, the open hostilities, depredations and invasion of which you complain, may be such measures, not only did not violate, but actually and vigorously did maintain and exercise the general rights of sovereigns under the law of nations, as laid down by Grotius, Puffendorf, and every other civilian. And, Fourthly, the King of Prussia's conduct, supported by the Crown of Great Britain, in invading Saxony, and then obliging the Saxon army to lay down their arms at Pirna, before the King of Poland, Elector of Saxony, had committed hostilities against his Prussian Majesty, demonstrates the practice under the law of nations in the conjuncture I have described, and justifies the conduct of the Court of France in committing, aye, Sir, and in commencing, as I shall more pointedly shew, had France done so, hostilities on the faithful subjects and invasion of the dominions of GreatBritain. But, Sir, Sir, when you had on the 18th and l9th of June last, by force of arms captured the Licorne and the Pallas, frigates belonging to the Court of France; and that it was after that period, that that Court first committed \""open hostilities and depredations on your faithful subjects,\"" and made \""actual invasion of your dominions,\"" it seems somewhat singular that you should have the boldness, in the face of the world, to charge the Court of France with having committed open hostilities and depredations on your faithful subjects, and with having actually invaded your dominions in time of profound peace, thereby disturbing the public tranquility, and violating the faith of treaties and the general rights of sovereigns, without pretense of provocation, or colour of complaint!  As to the clandestine supply of arms by the Court of France sent to the people in North-America, before, as you have stated, the formal engagements between France and the United States, I have no reason to think that your Majesty has proof on this point. The Congress know of no such supply; and to be sure, they, to whom you are pleased to say such supplies were sent, are to be thought to know, at least, as much of this matter as your Majesty. But, Sir, be pleased to hear what they say upon this subject. They unanimously declare, \""That His Most Christian Majesty, the great and generous ally of these United States, did not preface his alliance with any supplies whatever sent to America.\""(2) However, your Majesty \""hath not forborne\"" to pronounce to the contrary.  Nor can the Court of France entering into formal engagements with Congress at the time she did, tend to criminate that Court, on the charge of violating \""the faith of treaties, and the general rights of sovereigns.\"" First, because no treaties subsisting between your Majesty and the Crown of France, precluded that Crown from entering into formal engagements with an independent nation. Secondly, because the engagements of which  you complain were entered into by France, with an independent nation in the full possession and exercise of sovereignty-a compleat sovereignty which had existed for nineteen months, immediately preceding those engagements.  Nor was the object of those engagements, a violation of the faith of treaties and the general rights of sovereigns. First, because the object was not to interrupt the peace subsisting between France and Great-Britain but only to repel the war, if you should commence it upon France; and to continue it, until the independence of the United States should be secured by the treaty which should restore peace. Secondly, because the United States, with whom those engagements were contracted, were at the time, free, sovereign and independent, and had been so for nineteen months before; and you were not, under the laws of nature and nations, entitled to their allegiance and government. And, Thirdly, because the general rights of sovereigns, so far from incapacitating, absolutely authorised His Most Christian Majesty to enter into those engagements, such as they were, at the time he did.  Thus, may it please your Majesty, notwithstanding your assertions to the contrary, it is clear to a mathematical demonstration, and your Majesty knows nothing can be clearer, that the Court of France did not \""disturb the public tranquility,\""-nor violate \""the faith of treaties and the general rights of sovereigns,\""-Nor send a \""clandestine supply of arms to North-America.\"" Nor did she commit \""open hostilities and depredations on your faithful subjects, and actualy invade your dominions,\"" until after you had actually commenced the war against her, by capturing the Licorne and the Pallas, two of her frigates.  Indeed, so far was the Court of France from even wishing \""to disturb the public tranquility,\"" existing between her and the Court of GreatBritain; or to violate \""the faith of treaties and the general rights of sovereigns,\"" that five weeks after she had entered into those engagements of which you complain, she caused her Ambassador, the Marquis deNoailles, among other things to declare to your Court, that \""the United States of North-America who are in full possession of independence as pronounced by them on the 4th of July, 1776, having proposed to the King to consolidate by a formal Convention, the connection begun to be established between the two nations, the respective Plenipotentiaries have signed a treaty of friendship and commerce, designed to serve as a foundation for their mutual good correspondence.  \""His Majesty being determined to cultivate the good understanding subsisting between France and Great Britain by every means compatible with his dignity, and the good of his subjects, thinks it necessary to make this proceeding known to the Court of London, and to declare at the same time, that the contracting parties have paid great attention not to stipulate any exclusive advantages in favor of the French nation; and that the United States have reserved the liberty of treating with every nation whatever, upon the same footing of equality and reciprocity.   \""In making this communication to the Court of London the King is firmly persuaded she will find new proofs of his Majesty's constant and sincere disposition for peace; and that his Britannic Majesty animated by the same sentiments, will equally avoid every thing that may alter their good harmony.\""  This friendly and magnanimous declaration, bore date the 13th of March last; but what was your Majesty's conduct thereupon? Why, on the 17th of the same month you sent a thundering message to your Parliament, acquainting them of this declaration-that you had sent orders to your Ambassador at the Court of France to return from thence-and that you was \""determined to be prepared to exert, if it shall become necessary, all the force and resources of your kingdoms\"" against that nation. Thus, Sir, by withdrawing your Ambassador, and sending that message, you absolutely made a rupture in your good understanding and correspondence with France; and cut off the very means by explanation, of preventing open hostilities being instantly commenced against you by that Court, in consequence of your message to your Parliament, declaring to the whole world your resentment, and that you reserved to yourself to Judge of the time when you would exert \""all the force and resources of your kingdoms\"" against her. Now, I say, in this situation of affairs, France was under no obligation to sit still, until you had matured your preparations to exert \""all the force and resources of your kingdoms\"" against her, when it might be too late for her to resist them. On the contrary, the law of nations, \""the general rights of sovereigns,\"" and the example of the King of Prussia in his invasion of Saxony, as I have already mentioned, clearly, fully and decidedly authorized the Court of France, instantly to commence open hostilities against \""all the force and resources of your kingdoms,\"" to incapacitate you from \""exerting\"" them against her. And had France done so, as she did not, her right to do so, must have been acknowledged by all the world. However, your Majesty, not altogether neglecting the respect you owe to your Royal character and the judgment of mankind, has not charged that Court with commencing, but only with committing open hostilities, depredations and invasion. This is a fact undoubtedly. But be it also remembered, that that Court committed open hostilities against you, only after you had actually commenced them against her. And yet your Royal Majesty \""hath not forborne\"" to declare and to complain, \""that in the time of profound peace without pretence of provocation or colour of complaint, the Court of France hath not forborne to disturb the public tranquility in violation of the faith of treaties, and the general rights of sovereigns, at first, by\"" doing that which she did not, \""afterwards, by\"" doing what under the law of nations and the general rights of sovereigns, she had authority to do, \""and at length, by committing open hostilities and depredations on your faithful subjects, and by an actual invasion of your dominions,\"" after you had captured above one hundred sail of French merchantmen, after you had actually captured 2 French frigates, attacked a third, the Belle Poule,  and thereby actually made open war against France! O! King! what will this world come to!  But, Sir, considering the terms in which you complain of the Court of France, mankind cannot but expect a corresponding conduct on your part: and any dispointment, naturally leads them to reason back from effects to causes. The outrage upon your Crown and honor, of which you so loudly complain, demanded nothing less on your part, than an instant declaration of war. You have made no such declaration, and only one cause, can in the nature of things, be assigned for that silence-you are conscious, that you are not in a condition to enter into a declared state of war with the Court of France. This conclusion is too evident to be masked; and a man must blink and wink indeed, not to see it. Nay, with all your Royal caution, you not only cannot conceal it, but you cannot avoid expressing it yourself. Having rashly pronounced a Philippic against the grand monarque, feeling your internal weakness, and too late sensible of your temerity, you immediately, in your next words, declare that you are \""desirous to see a restoration of the blessings of peace.\"" How are the mighty fallen! You evidently tremble at a view \""of other powers, however friendly and sincere their professions, however just and honorable their purposes.\"" Nor, seated on your throne, clad in your Royal robes, surrounded by your nobles, and encompassed by your guards in your very capital, do you presume to name the powers you fear! You, Sir, who would have shackled America, at length dare not exercise even the freedom of speech; least you offend powers and accelerate attacks, which in an agony, you know you cannot resist or repel! Nay, they even look you into silence!  May it please your Majesty, how has it happened, that you say so little as you do of North-America! You just scatter nine and thirty words among the Thirteen United States. Three words to each are but small marks of your Royal grace and favour. But perhaps as you are a pious prince, you had in view the thirty-nine articles of the church of England, and you regulated yourself by that scale. Or perhaps you have now reserved yourself on the subject of North-America, that with the better grace you may be more explicit and at large in the treaty which is to terminate the war and secure the independance of the United States. It is time your Majesty considered the affairs of this continent upon a more liberal footing, than you have yet done. Nor is it of any consequence to tell your Parliament that \""it would have afforded you very great satisfaction to have informed them that the conciliatory measures planned by the wisdom and temper of Parliament, had taken the desired effect and brought the troubles in North-America to a happy conclusion.\"" They were in no doubt upon that point as they knew those measures were really planned by your Majesty. Mr. Fox, in your House of Commons, expressly in answer to your Royal speech, declares they were not planned by Parliament.(3) Nay, he avers \""it was a libel against Parliament to charge them with\"" those mea-  sures. Your Majesty, no doubt must remember the principles upon which Solomon adjudged the child to one of the two women who claimed it. Upon the same principles do I determine between your Majesty and Mr. Fox. You speak of those measures with all the feelings of a parent. Mr. Fox, as a member of Parliament, shews not the least degree of tenderness for them. It must be, Royal Sir, a little disagreeable to your Majesty, to find yourself in a litigation, in which the principle of judgment is so pointedly against you, and drawn from so high an authority as not only the wisest of kings but of mankind.  But to return. Just as you enter upon this great subject of North-America, you at once stop short as if sick of it. So, a timid patient who must undergo an amputation of his right arm; reluctantly extending it to the knife, stops short to procrastinate the painful moment in which he is to lose his most precious limb. But Sir, the situation of your affairs calls \""so loudly upon you for your most active exertions, that I cannot doubt of your heartiest concurrence\"" in the necessary, though to you, painful operation of amputating America from Great-Britain. For this salatary purpose the deficiencies in your Majesty's speech ought to be supplied. Send a message to your Parliament and tell them that your fleets and armies are unable to recover to you the dominion of the United States-that your Commissioners have returned equally unsuccessful in the same attempt- that the United States set at defiance, \""the vigour of your Councils and the conduct and intrepedity of your officers and forces by sea and land.\""-that France has made common cause with the United States against you-that you firmly believe Spain and the whole house of Bourbon will do the same before the next campaign-that you have not been able to form any connection with Russia, Prussia, Holland or any other power, so as to render you any thing near a match against the apparent union against you,-but I beg your Majesty will excuse me for thus inadvertently advising an unnecessary clause. Upon a second thought I am clearly and decidedly of opinion, that you may altogether omit this last head, as Mr. Townshend (4) and Mr. Fox in your House of Commons, positively declared, that you had not \""formed Continental connections;\"" and Lord North in the same place confessed that he had not advised \""subsidiary connections.\"" Besides it is known that at the end of summer 1777, the Empress of Russia rejected your application for a body of her troops, with such disdain that your Ambassador at Petersburgh retired from the court, 'till he received instructions from London; and also that a subsequent application from your Majesty to the Empress, that her fleet should act in strict conjunction with your's, met with so dilatory an answer as prevented a renewal of the application. In a word, it is so clear and your Parliament are so satisfied that you have no prospect of aid from Russia, that your Majesty need not be at the trouble of saying one word to convince them of it. Indeed your very silence upon that subject in the  present dangerous crisis of your affairs, is more pointedly convincing than any words you can possibly use.  Your Majesty may also say in this message which I have the honor to advise, that on one of the last days of October, or on one of the first days in November last, I forget which, but it is not material as your Majesty knows the day, Count d'Almadover, the Spanish Ambassador at your court, by order of his master delivered to your Majesty a REMONSTRANCE of a very serious and decisive nature; but there is no occasion for you to be at the trouble of being more particular on that subject, as I presume His Most Catholic Majesty will in due time in more forceable language than you have at command, notify to your Parliament and the world the independent tone of that important remonstrance. And I would advise your Majesty to conclude this weighty message, with assuring your Parliament that \""by the blessing of God,\"" upon the United States and their alliance, you have no \""means of vindicating and maintaining\"" the remnant \""honor of your Crown and the interests of your people,\"" but by agreeing to the independance of those United States and satisfying their good and great ally, for the \""injurious\"" aggression you have made upon him. Considering your Majesty's habit of body and state of mind, I am sensible that this is a harsh prescription; but, may it please your Majesty your case is desperate, and it is absolutely necessary to your existence and future \""security.\""  You are pleased, Great Sir! to confess that your \""efforts have not been attended with all the success which the vigour of your exertions seemed to promise,\"" that \""the extensive commerce of your subjects has been protected,\"" only in most of its branches, and that you have \""called forth your militia to assist in the interior defense\"" of your seat of government. Thus confessing the failure of your efforts, the loss of a great part of your commerce, and that you are so hard pressed as to arm your militia \""to assist\"" in the defence of your capital; can you, Sir, be so contradictory to yourself as to continue in the vain pursuit of conquest abroad, beyond the Atlantic, and in a region in which you have in this pursuit lost whole armies, and sunk millions of treasure! Twelve months ago your Majesty's first Commissioner of your treasury, and Governor of your House of Commons, declared aloud, that your kingdoms could no longer furnish men or money for the American war; nor is it within the scope of the warmest imagination to suppose, that they are now more competent to produce those means of conquest. You have, Sir, received the ultimatum of the United States. If you deliberate long upon it, you may be lost. Already your throne totters under your Royal person. Your Majesty has deprived your Crown of that gem which irradiated your brows with glory; and you will do well in time to reflect, that that conduct which has disfigured your Crown, will, if pursued, destroy its existence. Farewell.

  Monday, February 15, 1779. He (1) informed the Committee(2) that his master, actuated by the most friendly regard to the United States, had ordered him to acquaint them that a great revolution had taken place in Great Britain respecting the question of their independence; that there had been a great party in the Cabinet Council of that nation in favor of that independence; that they were willing to grant that independence with certain conditions; that those conditions were somewhat similar to those proposed by the late commissioners; that they principally respected a kind of Federal Union, such as that the United States should assist Great Britain in her wars; that, however, this measure had been laid aside, the Cabinet being impressed with the representation of the Commissioners that divisions prevailed among the members in Congress, and between the Congress and some of the States; that by the operations of the Commissioners a foundation was laid upon which discord would arise between the United States and France in the ensuing campaign; that in its operation it would be sudden and critical, and that there was a powerful party against the independence of the United States; that the British Court, as they had always done, propagated and spread these suggestions throughout Europe, and were the more at large in the calumny, that some impressions might remain in consequence of the heat of the calumny; that although his most Christian Majesty paid no attention to these suggestions, yet he most strongly recommended concord without meaning in any manner to look into or interfere in the internal measures of the United States.  That such being the disposition of the Cabinet the beginning of October, the Court of Spain had thereupon taken her final resolution, as expressed by her remonstrance to the Court of London the end of that month, respecting her hostile operations against France, making the independence of the United States the preliminary article to a general pacification; that it was possible this would lead to a general peace, and that the negociations would necessarily be rapid as peace or war must finally be determined upon before the season for opening the campaign came on. That as the Court of France had no object in view but the independence of the United States, if this was to be obtained there was a great probability of peace; but if it could not be obtained, his most Christian Majesty would exert all his powers in the next campaign in prosecution of the war. That the Congress ought to lose no time in appointing a proper person to take a part in the expected negociations; that he should be furnished with ample powers, as well as the desires of Arnericans as her ultimatum, relax FEBRUARY 15, 1779  ing in the first as in his discretion he should see fit, the distance being too great, and the crisis too pressing, to admit of applications to Congress for mstructions; that the United States should consider their resources and their abilities on the one hand, and the probable advantages and disadvantages arising on the other, by continuing the war; that moderate terms might, perhaps, be now obtained; that the pride of Great Britain was too high, and her abilities too great, to submit to extraordinary demands at present. She might be able to continue the war for some years yet. France desired no aggrandizement by conquest, the Independence of America being alone such a debilitating of Great Britain, as to secure her effectually against the haughtiness of that nation.  That the Court of Great Britain had endeavored to form alliances upon the Continent; that twenty months ago she had applied to the Empress of Russia for a body of her troops for the American service; that she replied she had not been raised to empire by Providence for such a purpose; that she would not send her troops against a people who asked only for justice and liberty; she would not engage in such a bloody work. In short, she answered with such disdain, that the British ambassador retired from Court till he received instructions on that head from London; that these instructions were in such mild terms, that he returned as if nothing had happened; that afterwards he applied to the Empress that her Majesty should act in strict conjunction with the British, and that a large district in America would be assigned to the Empress; but she answered this in such a manner, as discouraged a renewal of the application. That Britain had also proposed to the King of Prussia to loan an army of observation, with the view of collecting to it such forces as were against the interests of the Emperor; that the King, the Emperor, and the Queen of Hungary, had applied to his Master to mediate in the disputes relative to Bavaria, that he being in alliance with Vienna, had not chosen to be alone the arbiter but had called upon Russia to be a co-umpire, to which the King of Prussia and the Emperor had consented; that the Empress of Russia had desired of the King of France to mediate between her and the Porte, that thus it appeared none of the Great Powers of Europe would take part against France, and that Great Britain was destitute of alliances against his Master; that Spain wished to have the territorial claims of the United States terminated. She wished to have the navigation of the Mississippi shut, and possession of the Floridas; that she disliked the neighborhood of the British in that quarter, who were too restless and enterprising, and preferred that of the United States; that if the war continued, a subsidy might be obtained of Spain in aid of the pecuniary wants of the United States; that this aid was most honorable to protect States to obtain under the mark of a subsidy; that it might at a loose rate call for 6,000 men when not more than 3,000 would be expected to be embodied for the reduction of the Floridas, to be relinquished to Spain when conquered that Spain might obtain that territory independent of the States; that if a peace now took place, Spain would have no claim upon the United States,   nor would they have any upon the Floridas; that if this subsidy took place, the money might be lodged in respectable private hands in Paris, and if prudently managed would give the States a credit in Europe equal to their wishes; that at all events the United States should exert themselves to prepare for another campaign, and put on the appearance of aiming at more than they meant to strike at; for such an appearance would accelerate the negociations, especially if the United States could strike a blow, which, though not important, might be brilliant; that peace was the time for the United States to recover their finances; that France had just begun to recover hers when hostilities begun between her and Britain; that had those hostilities been postponed two years, she would be more competent to the war; that, however, France had made every necessary arrangement for the next campaign. But that, as her exertions, and the maintenance of 60,000 men on the frontiers of Germany, to enforce her umpirage, would occupy all her resources, she was not able to afford those aids to America, which she was disposed to do, considering as she did the interests of America as her own.

Drayton.\""  1 Conrad Alexandre Gerard.  2 That is, the committee of the whole. See JCC, 13:184-85. At the beginning of February, Gerard's relations with Congress had been strained because of the delegates' anxiety over obtaining naval aid from the comte d'Estaing and the effects of French procurement practices in depreciating the Continental dollar. But following Congress' decision to drop its request to d'Estaing for aid and an interview with Gerard and Jean Holker on exchange rates, the French minister felt the time had arrived to broach the subject of American peace terms, especially in light of prospects for Spanish involvement in the war against Britain. Therefore Gerard notified Congress in a note dated the 8th that he had \""matters of the highest importance\"" to communicate, in consequence of which President Jay was ordered on the 13th to notify him that Congress would receive him \""in a private audience.\"" Gerard's February 8 communication to Jay is endorsed by Secretary Thomson, \""Read Feby 9,\"" but Thomson's journal entry of the 9th contains no mention of the matter.

  Dear Robert Philadelphia, 16 Feb. 1779 Your Favor of the 3d Inst. came to Hand this morning. (1) The Satisfaction my Letter afforded you flatters as well as pleases me. It argues a Remembrance of former Times; for which & other Reasons I shall give you no more opportunities of joining the assembly of Angels in rejoicing over penitent Mortals. Not that I mean, on the one Hand, to enter the State of Reprobation & become a hardned Sinner, or on the other enlist with those Saints who slip not with their Feet. This Letter, written on the very Day I recd. Yours, will be some Evidence of my having gone thro the whole Process of Amendment. Divines you know describe it as consisting of Conviction, Contrition, and Conversion. Whether I shall persevere or not, is a Subject on which Time will utter the surest Prophecies.  The Complections of Resignation, soft Complaint, and joyless Sensibility, are so blended in your Letter, that (if anonymous) one would suppose it written by a wayworn Traveller thro' this Vale of Tears, who journeying towards his distant Heaven, thro sultry Heats and dreary Paths, at Length lays his languid Limbs under some friendly Shade, and permits the Effusions of his Soul to escape in words. My Friend a mind unbraced and Nerves relaxed are not fit Company for each other. It was not a Man whom the Poet tells us \""pined in Thought and sat like Patience on a monument smiling at Grief.\"" In such rugged Times as these other Sensations are to be cherished. Rural Scenes, domestic Bliss, and the charming Group of Pleasures found in the Train of Peace, fly at the approach of War, and are seldom to be found in Fields stained with Blood, or Habitations polluted by outrage and Desolation. I admire your Sensibility, nor would I wish to see less Milk in your Veins-you would be less amiable. In my Opinion however your Reasoning is not quite just. I think a Mans Happiness requires that he should Condescend to keep himself free from Fleas and Wasps, as well as Thiefs and Robbers.  When the present Session of your Legislature is ended, take a Ride and see us. You will find many here happy to see you. Morris has not forgotten you, and I will answer for his Memory on that Subject. He is busy and useful, more busy indeed than most others-for besides the Affairs of Congress, he is daily employed in making Oblations to Venus and Sacrifices to  FEBRUARY 16, 1779  Aculapius. Remember this is to be translated in the best Sense, and not so construed as to mean Vice or P-x.  The Report arising from Hakes Importations has no Currency here. (2) If it should, I shall put your Mark of Counterfiet upon it. I have heard Nothing of that Business since I left you, except Capt. Banckers telling me that some of the goods had been discovered and seized. If Hake deserved half the Censure bestowed upon him by those, who ought to have known him, he had a Right only to that Species of Politeness which Gentlemen practice to keep men of that Character at a Distance.  I have something, tho not very interesting, to say to you on the Subject of Politics, but as it is now very late, and I have been writing Letters ever since Dinner, I am really too much fatigued to proceed. Make my Compliments to Mrs. Livingston, who I presume is with You. Adieu, I am your Frd. and Servt, John Jay.  P.S. You say Nothing of Edward.(3) ""

I shall do every thing in my power towards the gratification of your wish, but it is very difficult at this time to get a grant of money. Our ships have been so unfortunate that many gentlemen (perhaps from different motives) very reluctantly consent to the appropriation of money to that service; however there are those who think differently and see clearly the importance of a Navy. Nothwithstanding the views on both Sides the question may be well intended, these different sentiments have a tendency to procrastinate matters which may sometimes be of great importance.  Notwithstanding your unfavorable opinion of the finance scheme, I must be of opinion it will answer a valuable purpose-perhaps we have not gone far enough-if that is your sentiment you have not an opponent in me, but there is room to go farther and I hope something is doing in Europe that may tend to advance the value of our paper currency, though I am convinced no just plan but taxation can do the business. You seem to be afraid that the present generation will do too much-dont be concerned about that my friend; you need be under no apprehension but posterity will have full enough to do and I think we are told by good authority that our utmost exertions will fall short of our duty.  I have urged the Commercial Committee to settle the commissions on some general System which they encourage me will soon be done, when you will have full information on that Subject. That Committee have lately wrote you (1) for a particular account of the cargos you have rec'd from France. I wish you would be very particular in this business and give them not only an account of what was rec'd by the different Ships but the State they were rec'd in also copies of the invoices (if any there were) that came with them, and if you have no objection, perhaps it may be as well to let these matters pass through my hands.  I shall endeavor to see Mr Collins so as to inform you per next post what he says of Mr Barrell's affairs.(2)  The last letters from France were dated in November-nothing then could be learnt of the proceedings of the British Parliament but it is certain they have not been able to procure any foreign troops, every intelligence from Europe seems to favor an opinion that the Independence of America will be acknowledged by most of the European powers in the course of a few months, but the acknowledgment of Britain may be tacked to some disagreeable propositions; it therefore will be necessary that we should be formidable in the field and I hope every exertion will be used by the different states for that purpose; the ensuing campaign will I am confident close the scene if we act with vigor.  I am very respectfully yours &c. W.W. FEBRUARY 16, 1779  [P.S.] I expect the Navy Board at Boston will speedily have a supply of money. (3)  ""

  My Dear Bror. Philadelphia 16th Feby 1779 I believe my last to you was the 3d inst since which I have receiv'd none of Your favors, it was on my mind that I wrote to you per last post, but on looking over my minutes I do not find it noted, therefore conclude I did not.(1) The last accots from Europe are in Novr. By which we learn that Britain is intirely disapointed in her expectation of assistance from Russia. The King of Naples has opened his ports to us, & we have every reason to expect the most favorable proposals from many European powers, perhaps in the course of a few weeks, I may give you intelligence that will afford the highest satisfaction, but you must not be too sanguine in expectation of a speedy Peace, 'tho I have no doubt overtures of that sort will e'er long be made by Britain, but I am inclined to think that such terms will [be] anexed to them as cannot be accepted consistant with good faith.  Let me know how the Resolutions of Congress respecting Money matters operate-inform me what were the prises of Masts by the former Contracts and what they may be procured for now supposing the pay to be made in something permanent.  The news papers I send from time to time will afford you some amusement-the impression Mr. D-s first publication made on the minds of people I suppose is by this time taken off. I am inclined to think, when matters are fully investigated, his character will appear in a much worse light than people at present have an idea of, and the Characters of those who he has endeavourd to blacken, will appear with great lustre.

I am Sorry to hear that the troops in and About the highlands are so Short of provisions, and am much Surprised when you Say that not more than ten Days provisions are purchased. What can be the Cause of this? Is the Commissaries deficient in their Duty or is there a Real Scarcity; I should be glad to be Informed to which of these Causes it may be attributed or to what other.  The Observations which you have made in your letter on money matters I think is well worth the notice of our Treasury Bench, and therefore I Shall Lay that part of it before them, as in my opinion there are some hints which will be usefull to them.

  My Dear Sir, Philadelphia 18th Feby 1779 Your two favors of the 9th & 20th Jany came to hand Yesterday (1). I do not wonder at your uneasiness on accot. of the scituation of the Curry; I hope what has been done by Congress will have some tendency to reestablish the credit of it, however something more must be done, & I trust, very shortly will. I am sorry to find Your mind in so gloomy a scituation. \""You fear, nothing but peace will save us from destruction\"". These my Friend are sentiments calculated for the meridian of Pensylvania. Peace to be sure is desireable but in my Opinion a secondary Object, war with all its horrors is preferable to an inglorious peace. I hope we shall never consent to such a peace as will involve posterity in greater evils than we have suffered. I have no doubt but there is vertue enough in the Army to undergo the fatigues of one more campaign. They must be sensible that everything that can be is done for their comfort, & I will undertake to say that the strictest justice will be done them when it is in the power of their Country to do them that justice. I have heard nothing of Genl Sullivans calling for the Militia.(2) He has never intimated any such intentions to Congress nor can I have the least conseption what they can be wanted for at this time. The design of the publication you mention I believe was to conceal the Villany of the publishers.(3) I need say nothing to you of the Characters he endeavours to blacken, you know them to be some of the best that this contest has brought on the stage. The Character he chiefly aims at, (4) America is certainly under very great obligations to: to him we are indebted for every peice of good information we have received from Europe since the commencement of the dispute with Britain. I am well satisfied the publisher wod give all his smugled wealth to recall that performance but it is too late, he has tho' without intention given the key by which his base designs will be discovered & I hope public justice will be done. There can be no dependence on the intelligence you get from York, that part respecting the 100 Dollar Bills certainly is not true.  By the last accots from Europe American affairs have a much better aspect there than here, the perticulars I have not Liberty at present to communicate, but I f[l]atter myself I shall e'er long have it in my power to give you such intelligence as will dispel those gloom that at present seem to pervade Your mind. But I hope every faculty will be exercised to FEBRUARY 18, 1779  have a very respectable army in the field, if that is effected I have not a doubt but we shall (under the smiles of Heaven & assisted by our allies) Humble to the dust the proudest nation in the world, have peace on our own terms, & make America the seat of Happiness; that these Glorious events may speedily take place-God of his infinite Mercy Grant, Amen.

  Dear Sir Philadelphia 19 Feb. 1779 Your very friendly Letters of the 10th Ulto. and 2d & 9th Inst. by Mr. Barclay, gave me Pleasure.(1) Accept my Thanks for these Instances of attention, and be so obliging as now & then to tell me how you do, and what political operations distress or promote the public Weal.  The Bill respecting the Council of Revision is a most insidious Measure. I always wished to see their Proceedings published, & think this Circumstance will afford full Justification to that Step. The real Farmers Plan of Finance is so abominably wicked as well as unpolitic, that it ought to be exposed, and the Eyes of the Public turned to the Author.(2)  We have no late accounts from Georgia. There is little Reason however to doubt of the Enemy's being in full possession of it. Large Reinforcements are ordered & probably gone to Gen. Lincoln. What his Force will on their arrival amount to is uncertain; nor can we be certain that they will be equal to the Recovery of that State. Besides you know militia cannot be kept long in the field. We are under no great apprehensions for South Carolina, tho several Circumstances render it vulnerable. The Enemy possess St. Lucia. What further Events have happened in the W. Indies is a Subject on which we have no Information.  Mr. Duane promises to prepare a joint Letter for the Delegates to you, & I imagine it will be ready in the Morning. Lest it should not, it may be proper to inform you that all the Departments are placed under the immediate Direction of Gen. Washington, & therefore that Provision for the Security of the Frontiers falls within the Line of his Duty & Authority. Pennsylvania is under similar Circumstances with you, & will equally demand & be referred to his Care and Protection. His Respect for New York, & the personal Regard he assures me, he entertains for the Governor, will I am persuaded unite with other more general Considerations in drawing his Attention to your Exigences and affording the State all the Security in his Power to give.  The Scarcity of Bread in the East & South is become a serious Subject, and I hope Care will be taken to prevent so great a Calamity in New York. Give while you have to spare, but Regard to self Preservation ought to set Bounds even to Acts of Benevolence.  One of our Frigates has sent a fine armed Vessel of 16 Guns into Boston. The Coast from Delaware to Chesspeake is extremely infested by Privateers from the City of New York. The Merchants here are preparing to protect their Trade by fitting out armed Vessels for the Purpose.  This State is immersed in politics & perplexity, the opposition to the Constitution is respectable & formidable. The Presidents want of Temper & Prudence has injured him. The public Papers will give you more Information on this Subject. Arnold is hard run by them. FEBRUARY 19, 1779  Be pleased to make my Compts. to Mrs. Clinton, and to the two Bensons & Lush.

  Sir, Philadelphia 19th Febry. 1779. We beg Leave to acknowledge the Receipt of your Excellency's Dispatches of the 9th Instant by Barclay. (1)  We lament the frequent Ravages of the western frontier. They have been severely felt both by our own State and Pensylvania; and we are called upon by every motive to be vigorous in the necessary Preparations for punishing our Enemies and protecting our Citizens. The Commander in Chief has spent some time in this City in Conference with a Committee of Congress. No pains have been spared to impress him with a strong Idea of the absolute necessity of attention to these great objects. The operations which will be most effectual are submitted to his Judgement, and every Department is placed under his immediate Superintendance. With him, therefore, we wish your Excellency to correspond.(2) We know that he has great Confidence in you and that your Solicitations and advice will have a proper weight.  General Schuyler also stands high in his opinion; & we are fully persuaded that any Plan which you & he suggest, or Requisition which you make, will meet with all possible attention. These are as fortunate Circumstances for our Frontiers as coud be wished, and we are persuaded they will be embraced. If any Obstructions arise, or any thing you may deem essential is omitted (which we have not the least Room to apprehend) we shall stand ready to support your Representations with the utmost Diligence and Zeal.  The arrangement of the army with respect to the relative Rank of the officers is not yet entirely compleated. This Defect, which has given room for dissatisfaction, is chiefly to be ascribed to the Committees' having left Congress before the arrangement was matured for a Report. It is however handed over to the Commander in Chief who is directed to finish it, the principles having been established by Congress. You will, therefore, be pleased to apply to him for Information; his own Anxiety on so interesting a Subject to the whole army will not brook Delay.  The Letters of marque and Reprizal are forwarded by this Conveyance agreeable to your Excellency's Request.  FEBRUARY 19, 1779  Preparations are making by Congress for the ensuing Campaign. The Intelligence from Europe is not sufficiently decisive to Justify the least Relaxation, tho they are by no means discouraging.  We shall be happy to hear that the acts of Congress respecting Finances & Taxes meet with the approbation and firm support of our Legislature Congress in this and all other Measures of Importance have decided with an uncommn degree of unanimity. We sincerely wish the same Harrnony may ever continue and prevail in the great Council of the United States, and be extended to every Branch of the Confederacy. We have the Honour to be with the highest Respect Sir Your Excellency's most Obedient humble Servants,  Jas. Duane, Wm. Floyd, John Jay, Fra. Lewis.  Reprinted from Clinton, Papers (Hastings), 4:580-82.  1 Gov.

  Sir Philada Feby 19. 1779 I have the Honour to transmit to you the proceedings of Congress in the cases mentioned or referred to, in your excellency's letter this day read in Congress. (1)  I beg leave to inform you that there has been no complaints made against genl Maxwell by the state or governor of New Jersey; the complaint was made by Mr. Clarke late a delegate from that state, as you will see by the extracts enclosed.  The case of lieut col Carrington is of a delicate nature. The attonement he made was so full and satisfactory, that could it have been done with propriety Congress would have willingly removed the whole from their journals, as that could not be done, they have taken the only step in their power, which was to order that this part of their journal should not be published.  From your wise feelings of honor, I am confident, that in any use Council may wish to make of these extracts, you will take care that lieut. Col Carrington's feelings may not be hurt. For though sometimes the manner of allowing for a fault sets a character in a fairer point of light than if no fault had ever been committed; yet to men of wise feeling it must give pain to have it publickly known they were once guilty.  I write this in friendship & confidence having no authority for so doing. I beg leave farther to inform you, that should your excellency or council FEBRUARY 19, 1779  have occasion for any minutes of Congress that are not directed to be kept secret, on the least hint to me, they will be immediately furnished.

  Dear Sir Philad. 20th Feby 1779 Accept my Thanks for your Excellency's favour of the 2d Instant. (1) I wish I had time to make my Correspondence either interesting or amusing; but it has fallen to my Lot to be involved in a greater Share of Business than I can discharge with any Degree of Correctness or punctuality.  It was but within a few days that we learnd that the Maps and papers concerning the Claims of the Revolters from our State were in Mr. G Morris's hand. I came from Fishkill with Information and a strong Persuasion that they remaind in the Secretary's office. On all Accounts it is a favorable Juncture to settle the dispute with these male-contents, and I flatter myself that Congress will do what is right & for the general Interest: They certainly owe it to us as an Act of Justice setting Policy out of the Question: for some of their own Acts and much more the Conduct of two of their Generals have served to enflame the Ambition of the Revolters and flatter them that the Seperation was not disagreeable to the highest Power. The Acts of Individuals have gone still further: I trust however that all these Projects will be baffled by Right and Truth.  Our Finances are in a delicate & difficult situation. I hope however that we shall be able to restore the publick Credit in spite of the malice of our Enemies and the Avarice of our Citizens. I am pleasd to find a free Spirit of Enquiry in your news papers. We shall be happy in receiving Information: & I woud be far from discouraging those whose literary labours are employd in so interesting a Subject. And yet it seems strange that the real farmer (2) has never stopped to ask himself whether any Man woud touch Continental money after it had been taxed 25 per Cent; or even a fifth of that Sum!, By the Authority of Congress: To say nothing of the arbitrary assumption of power which must be implied in such an Act. Congress have a Right to call on the States for Contribution: but the mode of Taxation rests solely with their seperate Legislatures. I do not despair but  FEBRUARY 20, 1779  Remedies will be discoverd if the last Act of Congress shoud not prove effectual: We must give time for its' operation and as well as we can reconcile our Citizens to the distress which that & every other Means which can be devised will occasion. The paper money has been extended too far: like a disjointed Limb it cannot be reduced without giving Pain.  Mr. Duer has left this City & will I hear soon be married. I shall take the first opportunity to communicate the kind Sentiments you entertain of him, & these I hope will be seconded by the Legislature.(3) Well done then good & faithful servant! is a Reward to which no sensible Mind can be indifferent. It is a Reward which your Members in Congress study to deserve, & which while they act with Fidelity & Success cannot be withheld by a generous People.  A Resolution this day passed for supplying your Excellency with the military Commiss[ion]s: (4) but I fear they cannot be got ready in Time for our Express.  Be pleasd to make my Complimts acceptable to your Lady and Family: and believe me to be-with the utmost Regard-Dear Sir, Your Excellency's most Obedient & very humble Servant, Jas. Duane  ""

I flatter myself you can never believe I neglect you even tho' appearances shoud be against me overwhelmd in Business to which I am more than ever exposd, I have not the smallest portion of time left for Relaxation or the Duties of Friendship. When I make this declaration I do not boast: I wish it was otherwise. But the Cares of Congress are swelled to an enormous Magnitude, and that persevering Industry which is more useful than Eloquence, even in a publick Assembly, is rarely to be found and where it is it is sure to be overloaded.  The General (1) has a great Esteem for, and writes confidentially to you. I need therefore say nothing on the military preparations you mention. Every Department & Detachment of the Army are put under his immedi- FEBRUARY 20, 1779  ate Care, and Congress have the most unlimited Confidence in his Wisdom & Judgement as well As his Zeal and Integrity. Congress I believe wish to give all his Operations what none have had hitherto, the advantage of Secrecy: for which Reason they have not been the subject of debate, & I fancy you are one of a very few with whom they are entrusted. I do not say this on account of Caution: to you it is unnecessary. I have Reason to think the General while attending Congress, or rather a Select Committee of five, expressed to many Members his Reluctance at your quitting the Army, I wished it coud be prevented.(2) No motion has however been made, & when it is I am apt to think it will depend on your Friends to turn the Scale. You will have a strong advocate in R. H. L. who took his seat this day.(3) You breath the Spirit of our Friend Mrs Schuyler-you pant for Retirement and private Life.

You will undoubtedly ere this reaches you hear the current bruit of the present time, i. e. that Congress are possessed of great news received from Europe but for reasons of State, think it improper at this time to be devulged; this has raised the curiosity of the public to know what the mighty Secret is. As a member of Congress I am enjoined to Secrecy, but think myself at liberty to communicate to your Excellency (in confidence) that Mons'r Gerrard has given Congress such intelligence as will put our affairs upon a more respectable footing than ever, but then it will be necessary that we exert ourselves in our military appearances, but above all in our unanimity, for the only hope Britain has now left, is to divide us.  FEBRUARY 20, 1779  The Rumor has this good effect, that Engrossers & monopolizers are at a stand, many offer goods for Sale, but few choose to buy, so that goods fall in price, and our money appreciate; the Express waiting obliges me to conclude Your Excellency's most Obed't Humble Servant,  Fra. Lewis.  Reprinted from Clinton, Papers (Hastings), 4:583.

  D'r Sir, Phila. 20 Feb'y 1779. I pray you to accept my acknowlegements for your Favors of the 2d & 9th Instant,(1) being much ingaged in Business and in very ill Health I cannot dilate. Let me only observe that my Colleagues were very unfortunate in that they did not mention to me more early their application for the Papers &ca. relative to the pretended State of Vermont. Most, if not all of them, some maps excepted, are in my Possession. I am sorry to learn from you that the Tax Bill will not probably go through. To delay this beneficial measure is almost madness. Inequity must happen in a Tax of any kind. I can raise solid objections against that you mention. So perhaps can others, and so may any man of Genius against any Thing.

  My dear sir Philad Feb 21-79 By the last Post I sent to Mr W C some Extracts from an extraordinary Letter which I hope he has receivd.(1) I think our Apprehensions are thereby strengthned, of an intended Monopoly of all the Trade and I may add of the richest Lands in America. The private & publick Letters of my Friend on the other side of the Atlantick having honestly stated Facts and led to important Discoveries, have renderd him an object of the hottest Resentment of interrested Men. I protest to you solemnly that the warm Affection I feel for a Man whom I never saw, is founded in a thorough Conviction of his long and unremitted Attachment to the Interests of America & of Mankind. But I will leave this Subject for the present.  The Spring advances, and very probably some new Overtures may soon be made, if it is only to feel the Pulse of America. Perhaps there may be a real Design in the British Cabinet to propose Terms of Accommodation. We ought then to be previously thoughtful of so serious and momentous a Subject. I have Reason to think that Britain finds herself perplexd in the forming of Alliances and procuring Resources to her Satisfaction. She has repeatedly and in vain applied to Russia first for Ships of War & then for Troops. Her Disappointment may be owing to the superior Policy of France, who by interesting Russia as well as her self in the Affairs of Prussia & the Empress of Germany may have made it improper for Russia to take any Measure which may tend to involve Europe in War. I am affraid if we should be seriously engagd in negociating a Peace, there would be an intemperate pressing from without Doors for a speedy Conclusion, which would precipitate the Affair to our Disadvantage. It is probable that Peace may be the desireable Object in all the Courts in Europe while they are making the necessary Arrangements and preparing for War if that shd be the Event. If Britain should refuse to acknowledge the Independence of America a War with France & Spain wd probably ensue, and the flame would spread. In that Case, Britain might be obligd so far to withdraw her Troops from America as to leave it in our power with the Spirit of Enterprize to make such Acquisitions as wd ensure a safe & lasting Peace. But if Europe shd remain quiet & Britain, with the Ac- FEBRUARY 21, 1779  knowledgmt of our Independence shd propose Terms of Accommodation, would it be safe for America to leave Canada, Nova Scotia & Florida in her hands. I do not feel myself at a Loss to answer this Question; but I wish to be fortified with the Sentiments of my judicious Friend. You may easily discern that I write this Letter in the utmost Hurry.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia, Feby 21st. 1779 I have recd. your Favor of 4th inst. on the Melancholy Subject of the wretched Condition of our Country, and I can truly say, with you, that I have snatched a Moment to answer it; For the Multiplicity of Business on my Hands & the Manner in which it is conducted here, renders the Tasks I have undertaken arduous indeed.  The Scarcity of Provisions throughout the Continent, & the amazing Depreciation of our Money which renders that Scarcity more severely felt, are much to be lamented; but these are Misfortunes which in the present Moment are without a Remedy, unless it be in the Fortitude & Exertions of the sensible & virtuous Part of the Community, who may destroy the depreciating Spirit which prevails, and by Precept & Example, encourage that Industry & Frugality on which our Safety & Happiness as a Nation depend. Every Preparation should be made to encrease the Quantity of Provisions in Virginia the present year. Nothing can be more advantageous to the Country; for even should we be happy enough to obtain FEBRUARY 21, 17 79  Peace & Independence (and I do not despair of either if we continue firm & prudent) Virginia will be the Market to which all the States to the eastward of Pensylvania will immediately apply.  The Governor & Council are vested with Powers to dispose of the Convention Troops as the Necessity of the Case may require.  The 11th & 12th Articles of the Treaty of Paris are given up by France.

Whilst I know this, I cannot but feel an Indignation against the Conduct of those little Politicians (not to say worse of them) who know not how to distinguish between the Nation & a few individuals of the Nation; and who are so much under the Influence of Folly & Prejudice, that, when Harmony with that Nation is essentially necessary to our Safety, they are daily sowing the Seeds of universal Disgust.  I beg that the People of Virginia will not think that the Disputes of Messrs. Lee & Deane can be attended with any Serious Consequences to these United States. Believe me they would not deserve the serious Attention of a Moment if they did not interrupt the Business which is of more Importance.

  Gentlemen February 23d 1779 Your Letter of the 4th of February addressed to Congress was read the 12th and referred to the Marine Committee who have had it under their Consideration. (1) They Sympathize with you, in your losses, and are anxiously disposed to give you all the protection that can be expected from the Continental ships of war.  It gives us much concern that you should suppose yourselves neglected by your friends. The great dificulty of Manning the Ships, and the Superiority of the enemy has prevented them from being of that extensive use which might be expected. Yet we trust when you are acquainted with the determinations of the Committee long before the receipt of your Letter, you will not suppose yourselves neglected or conceive greater attention has been paid to One part of the Continent than another. You must FEBRUARY 23, 1779  recollect that Captain Barry was some time ago ordered on the station of Chesapeake, but was unfortunately taken in his passage. Since that time the Deane has sailed and ought now to be on the Coast of Chesapeake. Every exertion has been made and is still making to equip the rest of the ships. The Queen of France we expect has Sailed before this time. The Ranger, Confederacy & Providence will soon follow them. The Baltimore of 12 Guns in this Port is ordered to be fitted out with the utmost despatch for the same purposes. They have very Special Instructions and the main Object of their Cruize is the protection of the Southern Trade particularly that of the Delaware and Chesapeake. They are in the first place to Sweep the Coast from the Southward of Cape May to the Bar of Charles Town and afterwards to continue in such Latitudes and longitudes as are best calculated to give the greatest protection to the trade of Delaware & Chesapeake, and as often as circumstances and the safety of the Ships will admit of it, they are to enter the Mouths of the two Bays for the purpose of destroying the small armed Vessels that infest them. The Brig Baltimore in this port we have some apprehensions we shall be unable to man. Her Size you are well acquainted with and is one of those Vessels which in your Opinion are best calculated to aid and protect your Trade. If you can Afford us any Assistance in manning this Ship, or can point out any other means in which we can co-operate with you, we are desirous of doing it. The Gallies of Maryland have been represented to us a[s] sufficiently formidable to repell the Privateers that come within the Bay. These are Vessels which we think ought to engage your attention. Every State has A Number of Armed Vessels for its own defence and upon application to the government of Maryland, which we recommend, we have no doubt but your laudable exertions will meet with their encouragement and Assistance; If that and the measures already adopted by the Committee should prove ineffectual and you can devize any further means we shall readily afford all the aid in our power.  We Are Gentlemen, Your Obedt Servants P.S. Since writing the foregoing letter we have advice that the Deane from bad weather, and sickness of her Crew, had steered to the Southward.  ""

  Dear Kitty(1) Philadelphia 27 Feby 1779 Accept my thanks for your friendly Letter of the 20th Inst. (2) I am happy to hear that Sally has enjoyed so great a Share of Health during the Winter. It is a Blessing which has been sparingly dispensed to her for these three Years past; tho I still flatter myself that by Care & Attention it may yet be re-established. Her want of Spirits is an unfortunate Circumstance, and I lament it the more, as it results from a Cause in which I am nearly concerned.  I have been from Time to Time deceived in my Expectations of getting a House. We hired Mr. Gurney's in January-he promised to move the 10th Feby.-about that Time Mrs. Gurney fell sick, & still continues so. When her Health will permit her to quit the House is uncertain, tho I hope it will not be long-especially as the approach of Spring will invite her to the Country; where she was very averse to spending any Part of the winter. Assure Sally that the Moment this Obstacle ceases, she may expect Brockholst; and you will oblige me by favoring us with your Company.  The fireworks and Entertainment at the Camp, are said to have been well concerted and well executed. The Number of Ladies who were present must have added greatly to, what Johnson calls, the Celebrity of the Occasion. To this I am persuaded, my Correspondt. contributed not a little; at least if one may judge from her Intimacy with the Graces, who generally display Taste in the Choice of their Company. That You should  FEBRUARY 27, 1779  be a little mortified at not meeting with your Brother, I can concieve and account for; but what those other more important Mortifications should be, I cannot so easily divine or comprehend: but this is a Subject we will reserve till we meet.  Your Account of your Nephew pleases me, particularly that part of it which relates to his Excursions-more Attention you know, is due to his Health and Constitution, than to his Caprices or Complection-Unfortunately this Doctrine is treated as heritical by too many of your Sex. I regret your Mama's Indisposition as well on her own Account as that of the Family, but as mild Weather and dry Roads will soon enable her to partake of the Benefit of Air and Exercise, I hope her Health will mend.  Since when have you been an Invalid? You appeared to be very well when I left you-I fancy Philadelphia will agree better with you than Persipiney-I'll tell you why, when I have the Pleasure of seeing you. I have seen the Colonel, and heard of the attachment you mention, but as I seldom write a Letter without adverting to the Possibility of its miscarrying-Prudence bids me postpone a Discussion of this Subject.  Two Years have elaspsed since I have seen the Beauty you mention. In that Interval you know, Changes for the better or worse may have happened.  The City has been, and indeed still is very gay-no appearance of War or Want. Many Circumstances deprive me of partaking largely of these Pleasures. Business on the one Hand, and Sallys Absence on the other, allow me little Time or Inclination for them.  A Report has just reached us that the Enemy have visited Elizabeth Town, and burnt your Fathers House. This if True is a misfortune to the Family, which I hope they will bear with Fortitude and Dignity. Similar Losses have been my Lott. They never have, and hope never will cost me an Hours Sleep. Perseverance in doing what we think Right, and Resignation to the Dispensations of the great governor of the World, offer a Shield against the Dart of these Afflictions, to every body that will use it.  I am Dear Kitty, Your affectionate friend & Brother,  John Jay.  Sunday. An express from General Washington delivered me a letter from him this morning on the Subject of the Enemys Excursion to Elizabeth Town. From the Account sent him by Gen. Maxwell it appears to have been nothing very formidable-he mentions the burning of two or three Houses, but does not mention yours as being one of the Number, from this Circumstance I presume it is still standing.  I dined t' Day with Mrs. Lawrence at the Plantation-they are as hospitable and agreable as ever, and desire me to say twenty civil things to you and Sally. The younger Daughter has grown a fine Girl. I think she has more Beauty than any Young Lady of her Age that I have seen in Philadelphia. Adieu.  ""

  [February 27? 1779] To the Quakers, Bethlemites, Moderate Men, Refugees and other the Tories whatsoever, and wheresoever, dispersed. Peace.  I (1) entered into the American contest from a love of my fellow-creatures. Lamenting as a Philosopher the consequences of my conduct as a citizen, while I strove to expel despotism I wept over the victims of ambition. That principle which first prompted me remains uneffaced, nor can I except from amongst men, even those who are my enemies. Equally capable of freedom with others it is my earnest prayer that you may equally deserve it. The effects of prejudice are known, and humanity calls on us to remove it if possible; for the same bosom which flows with indignation against guilt, melts in pity of ignorance. But I intreat you to remember, that men who shut their eyes against the light, as they will deserve, so will they receive a double measure of punishment.  That it is the will of Heaven, mankind should be free, is evidenced by the wealth, the vigor, the virtue and consequent happiness of free States. And the idea that providence will establish such governments as he shall deem most fit for his creatures without their efforts is palpably absurd. Did he overturn the walls of Jerusalem by the mere breath of his mouth, or did he stir up the Romans to add Judea to their other provinces? In short, is not his moral government of the earth always performed by the intervention of second causes? How then can you expect that he should miraculously destroy our enemies, merely to convince you that he favours our cause? Sufficient notifications of his will are always given, and those who will not then believe, neither would they believe though one should  FEBRUARY 27, 1779  rise from the dead to inform them. Trace the progress and mark the incidents of the war, and you will see evident tokens of providential favor. For whether our success be owing to the folly of our opponents or to any other immediate cause, we are equally indebted for it to the bounty of Heaven. Many of our measures which you perhaps justly considered as unwise, have by an amazing coincidence of circumstances become the corner-stones of independence. And on the other hand, many of the enemy's most brilliant successes which made your hearts to sing for joy, have produced to you nothing but bitterness and woe.  I am led to these reflections and to this address, partly from perceiving and more from being informed, that you derive pleasing hopes from the following circumstances. First, the taking of Georgia. Secondly, the calumnies against Congress, and supposed divisions among them. And Thirdly, the symptoms of discontent, lately exhibited by the Executive Council of Pennsylvania. I shall take notice of these in their order, make some short observations on public affairs, and then leave you to judge. I exhort you to read with attention, and to determine with that coolness which is due to a subject so important to your welfare, perhaps your existence.  The expedition against Georgia was dictated by the necessities of the British army, and the danger of their own dominions. In the first case they expected considerable supplies of rice for an army, and for islands in a starving condition. In the second they labored to establish a barrier between these States and East-Florida, the better to secure that latter, and thereby in case of a war with Spain check the free navigation of the gulf of Florida, thro' which the treasures of the new world are conveyed to Europe. The consequences are, first, to inspirit your brethern in the Southern States, and thereby to purge them of men who would have been pernicious members of a free society. These men will be justly stripped of that property and those rights which they have not spirit to contend for, and by banishment, poverty and lasting remorse expiate the guilt of endeavoring to subjugate their fellow-citizens. Secondly, this expedition will rouse the States of North and South-Carolina. They will derive from it that energy which is acquired in a state of war, and which produces obedience and subordination so necessary to society in a state of peace. But thirdly, what is of more importance to such of you as dwell in the middle and eastern States, is, that by dividing the force of your friends, whatever may be the lot of those wretches who are doomed to wrestle with a baneful southern clime, it renders their army at New York less efficient and consequently less capable of assisting you.  As to the calumnies against Congress and supposed divisions in that body, you are greatly tho' not altogether mistaken in the latter fact, and at any rate draw from it very false conclusion. The late abusive writings shew indeed the illiberality of the respective writers, but by no means impeach those against whom they are directed. Being equally indifferent to the several performers, I wish not to balance their respective merits. This is certain that Billingsgate language marks at most a Billingsgate  education, and among those who know the real value of such performances, the reputation of a virtuous citizen will not suffer more from the scurrility of a news-paper, than from the nervous diction of an oysterwench. The licentiousness exhibited on these occasions, demonstrates the existence of liberty, which is a pleasing consideration to those who have a value for it. And altho' such productions may offend individuals, yet they are not without use to society, in like manner as the blasts of winter tho' keen are wholesome. We may further deduce from it the falacy or rather falsity of what was once a favorite position among you, that people did not dare to utter their sentiments, neither is it unworthy of your attention that the various attacks upon Congress have not drawn the least notice from that body. From hence it is to be concluded that they have a well founded confidence in themselves, for did the shaft stick, it would make the body sore. And nothing is truer than this, that little minds are more resentful than great ones, and truth more resented than falsehood. From some acquaintance and good information I will venture to add, that the present Congress considered in the double view of abilities and integrity is at least as respectable as any which hath yet been assembled. Let it not be concluded from this, that I conceive the individuals of that body to be of a superior nature. They like other men are subject to passions, prejudices, weaknesses and the influence of the elements, and since the Deity chose one Judas among twelve disciples, it cannot be wondered at if among a much greater number some few should be charged with peculiar pravity. But this by no means militates against the general observation.  To say there are divisions in Congress is only saying in other words that it is a popular Assembly. Different views of the same subject naturally lead men to differ in sentiments. Personal connections excite personal emotions, and the conflict of such emotions sometimes produces personal altercation. The heats inevitable on such occasions seldom evaporate within the walls of one house, but stimulate to bitter observations easily credited, because they flatter a self-importance which is uneasy at any kind of superiority. Perhaps you will ask how it happens that such things did not exist formerly? They did; but the public dangers and distresses taught men to keep more secret those things which they readily divulge in an hour of greater security. The appearance of such divisions therefore in personal matters are striking marks of national prosperity, and you will find, that however the members of Congress may disagree about who shall be in and who shall be out, they will be firmly united in refusing to accept the independance Great-Britain is about to offer, and insist on a clear, explicit and pointed acknowledgment of it in the most extensive sense previous to any treaty whatsoever.  For what regards the dispute between the Executive Council of this State and Congress it is, as far as your views may be served by it, the most trifling of all trifling things. Stimulated by a laudable zeal to discover public abuses, their suspicions were turned on one to whose gallantry America is much indebted. Greatness and weakness are sometimes nearly   allied. That spirit which carried him in triumph over the fields of honor, induced a want of respect for Magistrates to whom he did not deem himself accountable. Charity bids us believe that conscious innocence inspired an elevation which he would not have felt under the pressure of guilt. Perhaps also it was regard to the privileges of his brother soldiers which rejected submission to other than a military tribunal, when his conduct as an officer was arraigned. These and many other reasons doubtless suggested themselves to the Council, and had they been at liberty to obey those dispassionate sentiments which embellish their high office, his refusal might perhaps have been disregarded. But on the one hand attachment to the interests of America, and on the other divisions in their state and doubts about their authority, which naturally rendered them more jealous of it than those to whom dignity and power are familiarized, these motives would not permit a moment delay in pursuing the interests and vindicating the majesty of the people. Perhaps there may have been some little personalities concerned, tho' the reverence which is due to the Supreme Executive of an independent State, opposes the idea. But be this as it may, Congress seems to have viewed the matter somewhat differently from the State. Conscious of possessing the love and respect of their countrymen in arms as well as of others, they were not open to angry impressions, which indeed are of little use either in public or private life. Affection also for an army which hath served them so faithfully, so generously, might raise some prejudice in favor of it's members; as an indulgent parent smiles at the petulant vivacity of a favorite child. They did not therefore catch the resentments of the Council, and tho' determined to support the authority of a State, they were not eager to blemish the reputation of a worthy soldier. The Council probably influenced by good reasons which they will undoubtedly declare at a proper time, came to certain resolutions which they have published and transmitted to the several States. But this little feverish ebullition, and the ridicule which many have attemted to cast upon it, can do no good to you. The Assembly of Pennsylvania which by their constitution is of real importance, acts in perfect harmony with the Congress. And depend upon it, whatever your leaders may flatter you with, the Whigs of Pennsylvania will not engage in any dispute with the representative body of America to the prejudice either of the acknowledged rights of that body, or of the privileges of those brave citizens who have drawn their swords in the cause of Freedom.  And even if any such dispute should exist, can you suppose, that in case of necessity, the President of that State would hesitate a moment to head his militia? That he would not instantly take the field with his wonted alacrity? That he would not fight under the banners of America with his former zeal? Those who know him know better. It would be equally absurd for you to suppose that the Council are disposed to promote public divisions, in order to favor the negociations of the enemy. Do not dwell on the mysteriousness in Doctor Berkenhout's affair. It is nothing new that an   artful man should impose upon the unsuspicious. Honesty and knowledge are very different things, and of the two the former is the most amiable.  As little ground have you for hope in the depreciation of the Continental money. You know that this is in a great degree to be attributed to the arts of interested men whose efforts to acquire it shew their conviction of it's value. I know it hath been a fashionable doctrine, that after the emissions should amount to a certain sum, the bubble, as the phrase was, would burst. But the absurdity of this to men acquainted with human nature was evident. The reasons are needless, because we may appeal to experience to shew whether there is the least danger of this event. When two emissions were called in, and every method, consistent with justice and good faith, taken to stop their circulation; those who had principally contributed to depreciate the money were the very persons who continued to receive the vicious emissions. For as soon as it became a question, whether they should lose not the value, but merely the use of so much money, they made every effort to uphold the credit of it. A few days ago, when a report prevailed of the arrivals of some favorable intelligence from Europe, such of you as are in this city cannot but remember the rapid fall of every article, specie not excepted. Hence the deduction is clear that the money issued by Congress is intrinsically worth what they contend, but is depreciated by the quantity in some degree, and more by the arts of engrossers. Take the familiar proposition, that a country will easily bear taxation to the amount of some given part of the circulating medium, suppose a tenth, tho' in fact one fifth may be raised among a free people, and you will see that, let the paper medium be increased to any degree, it may be sunk in a short period.  Not pretending to great knowledge of national secrets, and little desirous of communicating whatever of this kind it hath fallen to my lot to know, I shall reason with you on these things as I have reasoned for myself, and I trust the event will verify my conclusions. And first I consider it to be manifestly the interest of every Court in Europe to foster our independence because it is in effect the dividing a great empire, whose power was formidable, and whose insolence was insupportable.  Beginning with Russia; iron, potash and such other commodities as that country produces in common with this, will now have equal advantages at the London market, because no bounties will in future be granted by Parliament to the produce of these States. Sailcloth and the other articles produced there and consumed here will come hither directly from thence, and in direct return they will take our rice and tobacco, the commercial advantages of which are evident, not to mention the increase of naval force they may expect from it. Add to these solid reasons of national interest the personal character of the Empress. This is strongly marked by benevolence and the love of that fame which results from contributing to the happiness of mankind, a disposition evidenced by giving to her subjects all the liberty they are at present capable of. These considerations will naturally lead you to the answer filled with disdain which she gave to a proposal of the British Ambassador requesting her troops to subdue us.  19  \""My glory shall never be tarnished by the infamy of oppressing those who only contend for freedom and justice.\"" They will also account for her refusal to accede to subsequent propositions from our enemies the most disgraceful to them as well as apparently advantageous to her.  The spirit of the State reasons abovementioned applies generally all the Northern Courts, and it must be observed that the lesser will be very cautious how they contravene the veiws of the greater. As to Denmark her imbecility is the best possible reason why she should not side with the weaker party, especially when she holds the little of her West-India possessions as a tenant at will to the maritime powers.  Sweden, the faithful ally of France, if she acts at all, will certainly take part in our favour, and with twenty ships of the line ready at a moment's warning, is in capacity to afford us no inconsiderable aid.  Prussia and Austria, equally desirous of becoming maritime powers, equally desirous to obtain for that purpose a share of the American commerce, and actually at war with each other, will neither of them be willing to send force against America. Nor will the smaller German Powers dare to weaken their dominions, by the loss of a single soldier, whilst the Emperor and King of Prussia are armed in motion, and in capacity to swallow them up.  Of the United Netherlands and Italy nothing need be said, unless that at least a strict neutrality may be depended on from them; the reasons of which are too obvious.  France is already at war with Great-Britain for American Independence; and those who know the connection between the Courts of Versailles and Madrid, their enmity to that of St. James's, and their national interests, cannot but perceive that Spain will soon be joined in this contest, unless it be terminated agreeably to our wishes.  Hence then it is evident, either that we shall immediately conclude a safe and honorable peace, or that Great-Britain must carry on the war alone, and unsupported against France, Spain and America, in which case the two former will give every aid in their power, to our trade and finances, so that on the whole no well founded doubt can exist, that the Continental currency will rise greatly in its value, and that the independence and safety of America will be established on the firmest foundation.  Convinced as you must be of these things, what ought your conduct to be? You cannot pretend tb plead conscience on this occasion, because the success of our measures being apparent, it is on your own principles the will of God, to which you are conscientiously bound to conform. If you oppose your countrymen you may indeed incourage the enemy, and thereby lengthen out the contest, in which case you yourselves shall determine, whether you will not in some degree be answerable for the consequences. You have seen enough of war to wish a termination of it. You have sense enough to perceive that you can live happily under those governments which you wished in vain to prevent. You ought to fear that if the enemy perform their threats of wasting our country, your persons  may become obnoxious to the vengeance of your fellow-citizens, and your estates be applied to compensate the ravages committed on theirs. Take then the counsel which I again declare to you is dictated by humanity. I wish sincerely the happiness of all mankind. I wish sincerely the prosperity and glory of the United States. And as sincerely I wish for peace. May Heaven grant it to us, to you and to all. AN AMERICAN  MS not found; reprinted from the Pennsylvania Packet; or the General Advertiser, February 27, 1779.  1 Almost certainly Gouverneur Morris, who wrote several letters for Pennsylvania newspapers in 1778 and 1779 over the pseudonym \""An American.\"" He apparently wrote this article to quiet public alarm over divisions within Congress and between Congress and certain states, as well as in response to information contained in William Lee's recently received September 12, 1778, letter to Congress \""that orders have already been sent to [Great Britain's] commissioners in America to acknowledge our independance if nothing else will answer, in order to commence a treaty and make peace.\"" In an apparent allusion to the former motive, Morris later explained to Joseph Reed that \""My object was to prevent our Friends from being alarmed and our Enemies encouraged by Appearances of Disunion.\"" See JCC, 13:219; Wharton, Diplornatic Correspondense, 2:715; and Gouverneur Morris to Joseph Reed, April 9, 1779.  Morris evidently feared that reports of impending peace negotiations and recognition of American independence would lessen support for the war and fuel sentiment for a separate peace with Great Britain-a constant concern of the French minister Conrad Alexandre Gerard, who considered himself a close collaborator of Gouverneur Morris. And since Congress was simultaneously in the midst of reviewing the conduct of its overseas commissioners and establishing its peace ultimata, the subject was both timely and exceedingly delicate. Gerard manifested his interest in the essay by sending a copy of it to Paris, with several passages underlined, because, as he explained in a March I letter to the comte de Vergennes, he believed they were important \""pour connoitre L'etat des affaires en Amerique.\"" Meng, Gerard Despatches, p. 548.  Having ventured into the propaganda war then raging in the Philadelphia newspapers, exhorting Americans to stand firm against Britain's assault on their independence, Morris quickly found himself under attack, for two letters denouncing him, published over the signatures \""T.G.\"" and \""Common Sense,\"" were printed on March 2 in the next issue of the Packet. For additional information on the response of \""T.G.,\"" who attacked not only Morris but also his \""late colleague, William Duer,\"" see William Duer's Statement, March 9, 1779, printed below.

  My Dear Sir: Phila., Feb'y 28, 1779. I arrived here on the l9th, thro the worst roads that I ever travelled over. I find business of faction here pretty much at an end by the thorough exposure of its author, Mr. Silas Deane, who, if I am rightly informed, regrets extremely his publication of December the 5th. But be this as it may, he has certainly gained nothing by it here in the public opinion. I inform you with pleasure Sir, that the King of France has formally agreed to rescind the 11th and 12th articles of the treaty of Commerce, (1) so that now, the only unequal parts being removed, it rests upon the liberal ground of fair equality in every part. We are certainly indebted to Dr.  FEBRUARY 28, 1779  Lee's attention for this beneficial alteration, for which the honest voice of posterity will indubitably thank him when the poison of wicked faction shall cease to operate. The King of the two Sicilys has opened his ports to the vessels of the United States,(2) which is a good omen of Spanish attachment to our cause. Indeed we have abundant reason to believe that Great Britain will not get assistance from any power in Europe to carry on the war against us, and already our good Ally has made great havoc among the Privateers and with the trade of our enemies. We hear that 7000 British Seamen are now prisoners in the jails of old France. Notwithstanding these favorable appearances it certainly behooves us to get a strong army in the field, as the enemy have yet here a strength sufficient to do much mischief if they are not properly opposed. From the best accounts that I can collect, it appears that they have not less than 11,000 men at New York and Rhode Island. Yesterday accounts from Jersey told us the enemy had landed at Elizabeth Town, and had burned Gov. Livingston's house, and were advancing into the country. Our army was preparing to resist them, and if they do not quickly return I hope we shall give a good account of them. The enemy have published some curious letters of Mr. Braxton's which they have intercepted. I am informed they will be republished here, and when they are I will send you the paper.(3)  I am with much esteem, dear Sir, affectionately yours,  Richard Henry Lee.  P. S.-The enemies attempt upon Gen. Maxwell in the Jersies has turned out to our honour and their disgrace. Instead of surprising Gen. Maxwell, they themselves were surprised by his being prepared. The enemy were forced to retire with loss and disgrace, and without burning Livingston's house.  March 2. R. H. Lee.  MS not found, reprinted from Henry, Patrick Henry, 3:227-28.  1 See Meriwether Smith to John Page, February 21, 1779, note 1.  2 In his October 19, 1778, letter to the committee for foreign affairs, Arthur Lee had reported that \""The King of Naples and Sicily has declared to us in form, by his ambassador here, that his ports are open to all Vessels belonging to the United States.\"" See PCC, item 83, 1:345-48; and Wharton, Diplomatic Correspondence, 2:800-801.  3 For further information about these \""curious letters\"" and the controversy that ensued, see Meriwether Smith to the Public, March 9, 1779.

  My Dear Sir, Philadelphia 28th Feby 1779 Your favor of the 28th Ulto (1) is now before me. I expected the calling in so considerable a sum would produce convulsions, but hope will eventually have salutary effects, the Emission of May 1777 16,500,000 and that of Apl. 1778 25,000,000. The Gentn of the Treasury inform me they have given perticular directions to the Loan Officers respecting this Business, but as those directions did not go from this City till late in Jany they could not have reached N.H. the 28th. I hope the Collectors will be very careful to avoid Counterfeits, there has been more discovered in those Emissions than any others & some of them so well immitated that it is very difficult to distinquish them from the true Bills. I am not apprehensive that Mr. D____ s publications will be attended with very bad consequences, but expect the operation will be very different from his expectation, it is highly probable they will be the means of bringing to light such of his conduct as will by no means redound to his Honour, & will convince every honest man that he was totally unworthy of the trust reposed in him; You ask if \""there can be anybody that can justify his Conduct,\"" if you mean his publications, I answer there are none that dare do it publickly but I have not a doubt that there are some who were well acquainted with his intentions before he appeared in print & perhaps advisd to the measure, but finding him unsupported by truth think it prudent to keep behind the scene. Your own knowledge of the characters now on the stage will lead you to form an opinion whether he has supporters; You know that the greatest Villains that ever lived (especially in public life) have found Friends. You are also sensible that integrity & uprightness will meet with opposition, it is therefore by no means wonderfull that these different characters should meet with Friends, & Opposers, when so wide a field is open for the display of genious in the different modes.  The news papers that I have sent you at different times will inform you all I know of the proceedings of the British Court & Parliament, it is out of their power to procure forreign assistance. The Court of Spain has refused to mediate between France & Britain but on condition that the latter acknoledge the independence of America.

  [February-March? 1779] The Committee appointed to consider &c beg leave to make the following report.  It appears to your Committee that Mr. Deane did engage in private Commerce at the time that he was employed in the public business and having the direction of public monies.  That altho it does not appear in proof that public funds were applied to private purposes as yet a variety of circumstances support the conjecture.  That Mr. Deanes accounts for the expenditure of 37 Livres (2) have not yet been settled.  That in the opinion of your Committee it is proper that Mr. Deane should be called upon to make such settlement before the Continental Commissioners of accounts.  That as Mr. Deane proposes to embark for a foreign Country, it is proper that he should, previous to his departure, give bond with sufficient security to repay the public whatever ballance may hereafter appear to be due to the United States.  That it appears by letters of the Secret Committee to Mr. Hodge dated ______(3) that he was directed to purchase, fit out, and send to America, two well Armed Cutters loaded with Stores for the public use, and he was to lay his instructions before Silas Deane Esqr. and follow his advice in the execution. That these Cutters were not sent to America with Stores as directed but being purchased & fitted out in public and private partnership of which Partners Mr. Deane was one, they were sent to cruise for Prizes on the Coasts of England and Spain contrary to the sence of Congress and the desires of the Court of France. That these Cruises produced disagreable consequences both in France & Spain.

  [February-March? 1779](1) Mr. Deane in various parts of his Narrative assumes the whole transaction with Baumarchais-Consider his duplicity by comparing his own letter on this business by Mr. Francois with his letters in conjunction with his Colleagues both before and after his letter by Mr. Francois.  In the 42d page of the Narrative it is said \""In Mr. Lees absence in Spain a contract was made with the Farmers General for 5000 hhds Tobo. &c.\"" Observe the nature of this Contract and see how injurious it will be after the price in America, the freight, insurance, and Commissions are paid.  In Page 44 'tis said \""Mr. Hodge & soon after him Capt. Bell arrived with dispatches from Congress, in which the Comissioners were directed to fit  FEBRUARY-MARCH ? 1779  out, if in their power to do it armed Cruisers from France to annoy the British Trade in Europe, and blank Commissions were sent for this purpose.\"" See the Secret Committee's letter to Mr. Hodge (2) and observe how totally and expressly different it is from the State here given by Mr. Deane. See also the express condition on which alone Congress agree that armed Vessels shall be fitted out in France, by their resolve on this subject at Baltimore first of 1777, (3) immediately transmitted to the Commissioners. The business of Cuninghames is expressly opposed to the directions of the Committee, to the resolve of Congress and to the repeated injunctions of the Court of France. But Cuninghames affair was a Job of mixed public & private concern for the benefit chiefly of the latter. See Mr. Hodges letter where he says Mr. Deane was a third part concerned in this Cutter of Cunninghames-Thus sacrificing public good & public trust to private views.  Observe his praises of Williams and compare it with Rob. Morris's letter saying Mr. Deane was in partnership with Williams. Also the inclosed letter from Williams to Deane proposing leave to draw at pleasure on the Banker at Paris with whom was lodged all the money of the United States in France, and his particular expression \""My connections with you being known. \"" See also in the Commercial Committee, the Vessels as sent by Mr. Williams here with Stores bringing no Charter party, or information by which it might be known what was to be done with the Vessels after they had discharged their Cargoes, and the consequent inconveniences.  This does not imply such great ability as Mr. Deane describes-But it seems Mr. Williams was Mr. Deanes partner.  ""

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia 1st March 1779. Altho I have no Important Intelligence to communicate, or Leisure to write long Letters, yet cannot omit this opportunity of sending to you the news Papers, and telling you I am well.  A vessel with a valuable Cargo is just arrived at Baltimore. Whether she brings any & what advices from France I am yet uninformed.  My next will be more particular. My best Respects to Mrs. Clinton. I am dear Sir Your Friend & Serv't, John Jay.  Reprinted from Clinton, Papers (Hastings), 4:598.  James Lovell to Horatio Gates Dear Sir, March 1st. 1779 Your Favor of Feb. 16 was delivered to me the 27th by Doctr. Craigie. The Picture you draw of your Situation is singularly mortifying to me both as your Friend and as a Bostonian. I hope the Affair of Flour is in some sort of Train for the replenishing of the public Magazines and for the MARCH 1, 1779  supplying the Necessities of the People. Had the Government sent for Supplies at the Time they gave Certificates to Individuals you would have had no Reason now to cry out. But while New England Vessels & their Owners were alone to be concerned in making a vast Profit from the Necessities of the People, the Mercantile Interest were very strenuous for an Embargo to be continued. Besides, every vile Subterfuge has been used to get Vessels away to the West Indies which it was pretended were going to the Eastern States. The Commissary with all his Skill & Contrivance expresses strong Doubts of being able to feed the grand Army. Good God! is it possible that such a Continent as ours should not be able to feed two such armies wasteful & irregular as that of ours continues to be. Now that there is a Chance of these States consenting to export to the eastern the Capes are crowded with Privateers. It is said that upwards of 100 are watching Delaware and Cheseapeak. We have lost the military Stores going from hence for S[ou]th Carolina. I pity Genl. Lincoln with all my Heart. Who would have conceived that a Sufficiency of Amunition had not been imported into Charlestown? Our last Intelligence from the Southward is that all but the last Division N[or]th Carolinians had arrived, and that Lincoln was determined to use them in their welding Heat. If he does not, I fear he will soon again be at the head of a few Hundreds. He is said now to have about 7000.  As to the fortifying at Boston I must own to you I have not been distressed at the Delay which that Business has had in Congress. If the proposal should be complied with beyond fortifying the Harbour only I should never wish to Live in the City. If the Continent are to fortify they will claim the Right to garrison, which I should be sorry ever to see. I do not want my native Place to be turned into a Wapping or even a Portsmo., Plymth or Chatham. As to Du Portails Plan for the Continent at large, The whole Treasury of Spain is essential to it.  Some time ago I wrote you that I could afford to send only one Paper in common for Mr. Hancock, Doctr. Cooper & yourself. I fear you have not had an early Reading of it. I find Mr. H has one from the Printer. I shall inclose therefore to you unless you inform me that it is unnecessary. I wish I had a Mode of conveying to you some Things in Cyphers. I am most cruelly pinched for Time now but will speedily write again. Ask Doctr. Joseph Gardner one of my best earthly Friends to let your Clerk copy an Alphabet which he had from me, and which a thousand Persons may use with a thousand different Key-Words. If he has lost the Paper he will describe it so to you that you may make one. The figure from 1 to 27 denominate each & every letter of the Alphabet.

  Sir Philadelphia March 1, 1779 We have the Honor of your Favour of the 15th Feby.(1) in the Name & Behalf of the General Assembly, representing the State of the publick Magazines in your Quarter, & the Necessity of immediately supplying them with Bread & Flower; previous to which, being informed by Letters from the honorable Council to Congress, of the general Want of these Articles, & by a Letter from Baltimore, of the Arrival of Capt Malcolm for a Cargo on the publick Account, We procured the inclosed Resolves, which are the best that can at present be obtained.(2) We are greatly distressed at the Calls for Bread from our native Country, & shall use our best Endeavours to releive it; sincerely wishing at the same Time, that the Inhabitants may in future depend, under providence, on their own Resources, & be urged to raise Supplies for themselves. The Necessity of this, We think will appear from the present Difficulty of obtaining Grain & Flower by Importation. The southern States, on whom We formerly depended for considerable Quantities, are subject to excessive Rains, by MARCH 1, 1779  which their Crops in the low Lands are often swept away, & to the Weavel or Fly, by which their Stacks & Granaries are sometimes destroyed. This is their Case at present, in addition to which, a great Number of Farmers, instead of raising Grain, have been induced from the high price of Tobacco to turn Planters & raise this Article. Others distill the Grain, & thereby not only save the Amount of the Transportation to Market, but selling their whiskey at an amazing price, nearly double their Money. This pernicious practice is discouraged by the Laws of some States, whilst others are not disposed to pass such Acts, & suffer most of the Grain not wanted for the Consumption of their Inhabitants to be thus wasted, & converted to a Use destructive of their Morals. Great Quantities of Flower & Grain are purchased for the Army & Navy, & for supplying the Forces & other Subjects of our good Ally in the West Indies; whilst the Number of Husbandmen here, are greatly diminished by the War.  But had not the Quantity of Grain for Exportation from these States been reduced by Rains, the Weavel, the raising Tobacco, Distillation, Want of Husbandmen, & Demands of the War, We think, that shipping it to the eastern States, is at this Time, extremely difficult if not impracticable; being well informed, that upwards of one hundred private Cruisers (exclusive of large ships, Frigates, & Sloops of War belonging to the british Government) are now infesting the Coast, & make the Navigation more hazardous than it has heretofore been; We shall nevertheless use our best Endeavours to render successful your Orders for Importation.  That Part of your Letter which respects the fortifying Boston & Disposition of the continental Army, We shall communicate to Congress, who having already appointed a Committee to consider the first,(3) & another Committee in Conjunction with General Washington to determine on a general plan of Operation for the next Campaign, will of Course refer your propositions to their Consideration.

  Dear sir. Philadelphia 2d March 1779.  At my return to Philadelphia from Middle Brook (1) I found on my Table Your Excellency's favor of the 17th February.(2) Were I to indulge a Pen, always prompt to express the feelings of my heart, truths might drop, MARCH 2, 1779  which 'though truths, had better be understood than displayed, therefore I shall say only in one word, I count it one of the highest honors of my Life to have been for some Weeks an Inmate in my own House with General Washington & his Lady, an honor coveted by the first Men of the Age, hence you will see Sir, how much I think myself overpaid for those respects which you are pleased to take notice of.  Possibly the secret of preparing Fascines at Staten Island was unfolded at Elizabeth Town in the late project for surprizing General Maxwell & captivating my worthy friend Governor Livingston, had success attended these attempts, the triumphs of Sir Henry, & our mortification would have been in extremes. Emulation of the vigilance at that Post, will hereafter appear in every subordinate department throughout Your Excellency's command, every commanding Officer will think himself insulted by the Knight's repeated schemes for effecting surprize & carnage, which implies a disdainful confidence of finding American troops always off their guard.  Your Excellency will find under cover with this, two Carolina Gazettes which contain all the intelligence I have received from the Southward since the 15th January. Mr. Hutson has a Letter of the 21st of that Month, importing in very general terms, that Major General Lincoln was at the head of 3500 Men. Brigadier General Williamson commanding 1000 had given a detachment of the Enemy's Troops who were penetrating the Country towards Augusta a severe repulse.  A schooner loaden here with Military Stores, about 18 Tons, was captured on her voyage for So Carolina within a few hours after she left the Capes of Delaware. This is an untoward circumstance. Carriage by Land will be intolerably slow & expensive & the avenues by Sea are said to be shut up.  Mr. Barton the Gentleman who will have the honor of delivering this to Your Excellency, is desirous of paying a visit to his Father at New York; before Mr. Barton's arrival in this City I had received a Letter directed to his Father, the propriety of delivering it unopened submitted to me by the Gentleman who had forwarded it from France, upon enquiry I learned that Mr. Barton the elder had gone over to the Enemy, therefore by advice of my friends, I opened & found it to be from the present Gentleman, exhibiting a contrast of Characters between Father & Son. Upon the arrival of the Latter, I delivered him his Letter & requested a Copy of it, which I shall inclose under the present cover as the best recommendation of a suitor to Your Excellency for a permit to pass either to or beyond the Enemy's lines (3)-such a Permit cannot at present be obtained in Philadelphia.  Mr. Barton has desired me to add to his own the name of a Mr. Zantzinger who intends to accompany him. I know nothing of the latter & no more of the first Gentleman than I have already mentioned. I must confess myself prejudiced in his favor, but I have given him no ground for believing that I act the part of a solicitor. He understands, \""that I send a   Copy of his Letter, & that General Washington will do as he shall think proper. \""  Shall I request Your Excellency to present me in the most respectful terms to Mrs. Washington, a Box of Oranges &c. from Don Juan de Miralles is waiting the call of the Dep.

  Sir, Phila. 2d March 1779. Mr. Constable,(1) a Son of Doctor Constable of Schenectady, left this Country in the year 1773 and went to England on private Business. The war prevented his Return for some considerable Time but finally as the Continuance of it took away the Prospect of being able speedily to revisit America he came out to this City in the winter of 1777. Upon the Evacuation he remained and hath taken the oath of allegiance. At present he wishes to be placed in a Situation to visit the state of New York with Propriety and become an Inhabitant and subject. Having never done any act prejudicial to the Interests of the United States I am led to imagine that no objection can lie to this measure. But I pray your Excellency to write me fully on this Subject (2) and to point out the steps which may be necessary for him to take which will much oblige Your most obedient & humble Servant, Gouv. Morris.  Reprinted from Clinton Papers (Hastings), 4:606.  1 William Constable (1752-1803), merchant and speculator, had gone to England in 1773 as a representative of the Schenectady, N.Y., firm of Phys & Ellice. In 1777 he returned to America and established a mercantile firm in Philadelphia during the British occupation. After the British evacuation of the city, Constable remained in Philadelphia and developed business connections with some of the most influential American leaders, including the Continental commander of the city Benedict Arnold and later both Gouverneur and Robert Morris. For Constable's business career, see Donald G. Tailby, \""Chapters from the Business Career of William Constable: A Merchant of Post-Revolutionary New York\"" (Ph.D. diss., Rutgers University, 1961), chaps. 1-3.  2 Clinton's March 22 reply supporting Constable's request to return to New York is in Clinton, Papers (Hastings), 4:606-7.

  Sir, Philadelphia March 2d. 1779.  Inclosed is a resolution of Congress which we hope with the recommendation already given to the States of Newyork & Connecticut may enable our State to procure a supply of bread for its poor.(1)  MARCH 2, 1779  A Fly which heretofore had spoiled the wheat in Maryland, Virginia & No. Carolina hath proved more destructive the last season than formerly, and this, with an inundation in some parts of the two latter, have occasioned a comparative scarcity of that necessary article. However we believe a small quantity might be got in all of those States. We are informed that in the parts of No. Carolina which lie back of Cape-fear river there is a considerable quantity of flour, and that probably it might be obtained in the way of donation. Indeed the delegates of that State have told that it would be more likely to obtain flour in that mode than by purchase on the recommendation of Congress. Perhaps therefore it might be prudent to try both ways.  If the Assembly should think proper to send to So. Carolina for Rice Mr. Laurens a delegate of that State advises that our adventure should be made to Winyaw rather than Charlestown, the navigation to the former being the least hazardous. Indeed the whole coast from New York to So. Carolina, especially from New York to North Carolina, is so infested with privateers as to render commerce exceedingly precarious. Capt. Collins is of opinion that the navigation to Cape fear & Winyaw would be safer than to Chesapeak, provided that the Vessel ordered to the latter should be directed to keep as far from the shore as possible without getting into the Gulph Stream, until She should be in the latitude of the place and then crowd directly for it.  Pennsylvania was not allowed to stand in the report because the army which is in its neighbourhood will want more flour than it can spare.  We have moved Congress frequently on the Subject of our proportion of the Tax for the current year but have not been able to procure a decision. The members are very loth to counteract their resolution and thereby lessen the whole sum to be collected. We have a prospect of getting So. Carolina to take off fifty thousd. dollars and assume it to themselves. I hope we shall be able to struggle through the tax thus reduced. The more we pay now the less we shall have to pay hereafter when the money may be appretiated.  If we should have a good army in the field this campaign it will in our opinion be the last. There is no probability of the enemy's receiving any foreign reinforcements, and Great-Britain must take care of her Island, and protect it from invasions. Some troops have been drawn from RhodeIsland to N. York, and from thence we are informed that the Enemy at R. Island were embarking their heavy cannon. It is not improbable that the Island may be evacuated to en[able] the enemy to reinforce their troops at St. Lucia where their mortality is very great. In hopes that our State may be soon rid off those Locusts which have so long infested it, and that we may be speedily blessed with an honorable peace we continue with the warmest attachment to it and your excellency, Your Excellency's most obedient humble Servants, William Ellery  John Collins  P.S. I had spoken to the Secretary for a copy of the Resn. on supplies but it hath been forgotten and the post being just about to set out will not admit of our waiting for a copy. However you will receive a copy of it through the President. We have obtained a resolution for taking off fifty thousand dollars from our proportion of the tax and putting it on South Carolina since we wrote the paragraph respecting that subject.(2) The Secretary is so busy that he cannot give us a copy of it. We will send it by the next post. In the meantime the Assembly may proceed on taxation if they should think proper. We write in Congress. Wm. Ellery  ""

As Congress with the Consent of the Minister of France, have directed it to be communicated to you, further Remarks will be unnecessary. Doctor Witherspoon, who lately returned to Jersey, promised to do it in a personal Conference.(3)  A Committee was appointed this Morning to prepare an address to the People on the present State of our Affairs.(4) If properly executed, Benefit may be expected from it.

The Committee make a distinction between such prisoners as properly belong to a particular State, and such as are Continental being made so by the arms of the U.S. The former, each State will avail itself of for the benefit of their own people in the power of the enemy, as a Cartel can be agreed on with the enemy by such State, as hath been frequently done by the Eastern States.

At present no Cartel has ever been, or could be settled with the enemy for American prisoners in G.B.

I wish that Gentn may make some amendments in the Post Office, some alteration is certainly necessary, my letters are often 4 weeks & sometimes longer, on the way from Portsmouth. The Resolves of Congress respecting the Emissions that are called in, speak a language that need no explanation; (1) as they are receivable in the Treasury till the 1st of June they are certainly safe in the possesser's hands till that time, but he must be careful not to let that day elapse. Such a plan as you mention has been some time on foot. Our Commises. have their instructions for that purpose & I hope their endeavours will be successful. You certainly must be mistaken in Your calculation, I cannot see by what rules of arithmetic you make our debt amot even to a tenth part of the Debt of Britain. The Resolution of Congress does not hold up an idea that the assessment is justly apportioned, that matter is to be settled hereafter & that state which raises more than shall at the adjustment appear to be her just proportion will be allowed interest for the Surplus, therefore the State that raises more than her proportion will have greatly the advantage of those who do not raise so much; as the latter will have to pay & the former to receive interest; besides, if the money appreciates (which I have no doubt of,) the State who collects it now will have a great advantage of those who will have it to Collect at its apreciated value. I therefore hope N.H. will collect at least the sum set to her and as much more as possible, I wish it may be double the Sum.  I wish I could acquaint you with the designs of the British Court, but that is out of my power, some are of Opinion that there is a prospect of pease the insuing Summer, but that is an Opinion I can by no means give into, on the contrary I think every effort will be used to effect the distruction of America & it is absolutely necessary that we use our utmost exertions to frustrate their designes, if we act with vigour this Campaign I have no doubt they will give up the point, Dissipation & avarice will then be the only Enemies we shall have to contend with, indeed they are at this time the most Powerful.

6839,dg012166,1779,Gouverneur Morris to George Johnstone,"""Gouverneur Morris to George Johnstone
  Sir, Philadelphia, March 4, 1779. Having seen your speech on American affairs at the opening of the session, I cannot avoid making some observations upon it; (1) for although it contains important facts and sensible remarks, yet it is not without some mistakes.  You say, the cause of America is wicked, because we are united with France for the express purpose of reducing your county. The object of our alliance with the Most Christian King, is simply to secure that Independence without which our liberty would be but a name. And although you are too weak to maintain the present contest, yet you are too powerful to be conquered. Neither is it the interest of the House of Bourbon on the one hand, or of America on the other, that you should. Britain would be as troublesome a province to France, as America to Britain: Either would distract and enfeeble their masters. But, assuming your fact, is it wicked to attempt the reduction of a nation which hath lately shewn itself the common enemy of man? which hath drenched this country in the blood of its inhabitants, for the impious purpose of reducing them to unconditional submission. Impious, as you have repeatedly declared, as they have \""with singular unanimity\"" directly acknowledged. Is it wicked to crush a court and a ministry profligate beyond conception, and deceitful beyond example.  You aver, that the treaty with France is not ratified in a constitutional manner. You are mistaken even on your own ground. Still more are you mistaken on the ground assumed by your government; for they confessed the authority of Congress to form treaties, by the very application which brought you hither.  You are equally wrong in supposing, that the objects of your commission were frustrated by delay. The draught of the bills arrived in season, and the sentiments of Congress were expressed on them so early as the twenty-second of April, previous even to the knowledge, much less the  MARCH 4, 1779  ratification of a treaty with France. They were expressed with an unanimity which, on such occasions, is not singular.  You say, it was always your view that force should accompany the concession. What concession do you mean? The acts of Parliament gave no more than what you frequently contended for as our right, and to assert that there is concession in giving a man his own, is hardly common sense, but certainly not common honesty. The idea of vigorous coercion in the moment of treaty, is a genuine British idea. It is a good one, provided the offers to be made in treating are generous and honest; but if insidious and unequal, it is marked with the spirit, not of a man, but a tyrant. That preparation for war is the best means of obtaining peace, is an old and true adage, but there is an essential difference between peace and dominion. Those in either country who seek the former on safe and honorable terms, will be gratified; those who aim at the latter will inevitably be, as they ought to be, most grievously disappointed.  The opprobrious language you make use of is but little ornamental to your eloquence, and would flow with more propriety from the pen of an hireling than the mouth of a statesman. That the Congress in their proceedings have a respect to the people, is true; that they attempt to deceive the people, is untrue. Shew, if you can, a falsehood sanctioned by their authority. If you cannot, retract a charge which must recoil upon you. Whoever hath informed you that the newspapers are under the direction of Congress, was mistaken, or meant to deceive: And when you shall have the pleasure of perusing some late Gazettes, you will see not only that the Congress and its Members, but some other very respectable personages, are handled with sufficient freedom to contradict your charge. Be cautious, however, that you do not draw false conclusions from these publications. The Americans being really free, are subject, like other people, to the intemperatures of freedom. The conversations and conduct of your adherents, have seemed to flow from the following dilemma: If the newspapers do not blame measures and traduce characters, there is tyranny; if they do, there is disunion. But the natural interpretation is, that the former arises from public confidence and a sense of decency, the latter from personal emotion and the irritability of little spirits.  For what relates to the charge brought against you by General Reed, you will certainly acquit Congress of disingenuity, after you have seen what hath been stated on that occasion. Whether their zeal led them into declarations, which those who are accustomed to the business of corruption will consider as hasty and unnecessary, is not for me to determine having had no transactions where other means besides persuasion have been used. This, however, you may be certain of, that it was no political stroke to avoid the question about General Burgoyne's troops. Nor will the harsh epithets which you and others so liberally bestow upon Congress, by any means impeach them. Pardon me, Sir, for observing, that on this occasion the charge of duplicity lies against you and your brethren in commission. To enter into the arguments would be tedious; but if you will suppose us  to be, what we have declared ourselves, independent, then I pledge myself to meet you on the ground of national right, and shew that the Congress have acted with perfect consistency and integrity. At present I shall only observe, that you had no authority whatever to offer a ratification of the convention of Saratoga, and that you knew you had not at the moment in which you made the offer. At the same time I fully agree with you, that policy founded on injustice and dishonour is contemptible in private Iife, and where the dignity of people is concerned, abominable meanness.  That you was received at Philadelphia with joy; that they wished the continuance of the British army; that they made golden promises of thousands and tens of thousands to Join you, is extremely probable. They made the promises as an inducement for you to comply with their wishes, and their wishes were founded on their hopes and their fears. But as a negociator, it was unpardonable to rest your creed on the opinions of those who were confined in Philadelphia. Your friends would naturally resort thither from other parts of the state, and consequently afford but a partial sample of the remainder. Your enemies would not readily avow their sentiments under a military government, which had not been exercised with too great lenity. And as for the inhabitants of your gaols, their ideas like their information, would naturally be much circumscribed. Nor can it be wondered at, if in the lingering tediousness of long confinement, worne away with want, and broken with the insolence of petty tyrants, their spirits should be so depressed as to adopt any means of relief which might offer. Had you consulted the British Generals; had you consulted former experience, you would have known that all reasoning on such foundations is illusory; all promises by such men ineptious; all reliance on either absurd.  But it seems you are persuaded, that had you been at liberty to have acted in the f ield,your most sanguine expectations would have been fulfilled. Those, Sir, who had sanguinary wishes and expectations, would have been gratified; those who delight in human woe, might have beheld with satisfaction the fields of carnage. If there be any who can derive pleasure from the pangs of a helpless widow, or the tears of fatherless children, they might have been satiated with the savage feast. But you are deceived if you suppose that losses, defeats or distress, could have induced a submission to unreasonable terms. America has profited from her own example in the low state of affairs before the action of Trenton, and believe me, the object is too large to depend on the fate of a battle, a siege, or a campaign.  You seem to be of a different opinion, whilst leaving the plain road of facts, you wander through the fields of supposition, to shew the propriety of your former conduct, and what you propose in future. Suppose, you say, Admiral Keppel had beaten Mons. the Count d'Orvilliers, that is, destroyed half his fleet, which he was prevented from doing by the accidents of wind and weather; suppose Admiral Byron's Squadron had not met with a storm; if Clinton had not been ordered to leave Philadelphia, &c. Why did you not at once suppose you had fairly conquered America, as well as that Byron had met no storms, Kepple no unfavourable gales, and Clinton no ridiculous com-  mands. Incidents like these, should always be supposed by wise men. Wise men, Sir, will never stake the fate of an empire on the uncertainty of the winds, the turbulence of the waves, and the fluctuations of human opinion. Suppose d'Estaing had arrived in the Delaware before Philadelphia was evacuated, and that by the united efforts of his fleet and the American armies, you had shared the fate of the unfortunate, insulted Burgoyne. Suppose the Count, instead of leaving Rhode-Island had staid till the storm abated and then went to Sandy Hook to wait for the shattered fleets of Howe and Byron. Suppose he had in force have met the latter alone. Your suppositions, it seems, would have laid the topic of Independence asleep, and silenced its supporters; but mine would have placed the opposers of it in the most ridiculous light imaginable.  For the encouragement of friends and the terror of foes, you declare your unalterable resolution to die in the last ditch. The GREAT NASSAU made the same declaration, and in the mouth of a hero contending for freedom after the loss of many battles, against superior force and almost exhaustless resources, it hath a dignity and elevation which description cannot reach. But when it is used to color obstinate perseverance in a ridiculous war, for the sake of a bubble, a feather or a name, it is hardly in the compass of language to descend to such a deep profund. In what ditch, my good Sir, would you die? Shall the rich current which glides through your veins dash along the roaring Susquehanna, swell the great Potowmac, or fill the bay of Chesapeak? Shall it empurple the Canadian snows, shall it fertilize the arid sands of Florida, or stain the rocks of Nova Scotia, hard and unpitying of the generous sacrifice? The gentle Tweed can never be witness of his Johnstone's fate, for, indeed Sir, if you stay at home, we cannot possibly martyrise you. But seriously; why are you so apprehensive for Canada, Nova-Scotia, the Floridas, and West-India islands? It is not the interest, and therefore hardly the wish of our allies, that we should become dangerous to Europe, though it is their and our determination to render the United States secure. Neither can we harbor a desire after extended empire, when the pernicious effects of it on you are so recent. Besides, we have not men to squander on the unhealthy climates of Florida and the West-Indies. But why are you so inconsistent? You state us as very low and weak. If the fact be so, whence do you derive your apprehensions? You consider your nation in capacity still to subdue us. Why then do you harbor any fears? If our resources are really exhausted, if it is not in imagination to paint our contentions, divisions and sufferings, can you suppose that we shall continue the war for future improbable acquisitions?  You ask, What reason America can have for not explicitly declaring her intentions of conditionally renouncing her connections with France upon your declaring her independency? The answer is plain. Because she is honest. Would you go farther? Because she is wise. If she faithfully abides by her treaties, other nations will court her alliance. Suppose, for the sake of those fanciful advantages to be derived from an union of force with you, and to avoid the evils of war in a dubious contest, America had been guilty of breaking her   faith; would you have relied on her promises? While you strove to make her so wicked, could she rely on yours? Not to mention the criminality, is there a greater absurdity, than at the very moment when you would lead men to repose confidence in your faith, to shew a sovereign contempt of it, by persuading them to violate theirs?  You say, that your riches are greater than at the commencement of the last war, but admit the embarrassment of your funds. Is Governor Johnstone yet to learn, that money and riches are very different things when applied to nations? Have you more men? Have you more manufactures? Have you more plenteous productions of the soil? Three millions of subjects are lost. Fifty millions of debt are incurred. All Europe is against you.  Your war like operations, you say, are less extensive in Germany, the East Indies, Portugal, North-America and the West Indies. Who gave you the prescience to determine where and how the war shall rage? Are the East-Indies annihilated, that they can be no longer the theater of your battles and your crimes? What has become of Gibraltar and Minorca? Have you abandoned the shores of Africa? Have you let the miserable Electorate of Hanover to farm? Have you conquered America? Or does it require a lesser operation for that purpose, than it did, with the assistance of your colonies, to reduce Canada? You certainly are of a different opinion; for you think 25,000 men are necessay in America exclusive of what are in Canada and Halifax: These I suppose amount to about 3,000. Add to the account 12,000 which you ought to have in the Floridas and West-Indies, and it will make 45,000 men. You can neither send or maintain so large a force at such a perilous distance. New winds again may blow, again may storms arise, and fresh blunders be again added to the catalogue of national absurdities. Should a convoy be lost or a fleet destroyed, figure to yourself your so excellent, so beautiful, and so well appointed army, in all its comeliness, and in all its grace, panting for a piece of pitiful pork, or surrendering for the lack of musty biscuit. You speak of the American Tories as a shrew¢ cunning, sensible people, who will not join the weak and wavering; and will they, think you, join the ruined and undone? Alas! Surrounded as you are with dangers and distresses of every kind, prudence seems wholly to have abandoned you: And like a ruined gamester, having lost so much as almost to have lost your senses, you would stake your clothes, your wife and your children on the desperate hazard, till nothing remains for you but to die in a ditch.  You are led to suppose, from some riots which happened between the French sailors and lower kind of inhabitants in the brothels of Boston, that the indignant spontaneous passions of the people are indisposed to the French alliance. Suppose (since you are so fond of suppositions) that an English fleet should have arrived at the loyal town of Boston, would the officers and seamen have been received with open arms, and pressed and caressed by the inhabitants? Suppose an English seaman and soldier should come to blows for a prostitute, would you, from this circumstance, apprehend a   defection of your invincible fleet or graceful army? However spontaneous might be their-passions, you would hardly draw that conclusion.  It is said above, that peace may be had on terms safe and honorable for Britain and America. It may be added for every other party who may be concerned in the war. What do you want with Gibraltar and Minorca? As badges of sovereignty and of ancient glory, they may feed your pride, but they empty your purse; for your Levant trade is a losing game, and will, from our independence, be more so every day. These places are like thorns in your neighbour's sides, who, for that very reason, cannot be your friends. If you mean peace, they can do you no good; and therefore it is your interest to get rid of them on the best terms you can. Jamaica is, indeed, a valuable possession; but as it raises the jealousy of others and creates enemies to you, you should keep it no longer than until you can obtain something better in lieu of it. Your privilege of cutting logwood in the Bay of Honduras, is useless, now that so much better is brought from Kampuchea. And considering their situation, you cannot long possess the Floridas, or wish to hold the Bahamas. Why not then abandon all these things to Spain, who can give you territory of far greater value, and may perhaps extricate you from the embarrassment of your finances.  Nova Scotia, inhabited as it is by emigrants from the eastern states, and commodious for their fisheries, is useless to you, tho' necessary for us. Nor can you suppose we shall think you sincere, if, in a treaty of perpetual peace, you insist on keeping Halifax to check our fisheries and fetter our commerce. Bermuda is so dependent on us, that you cannot wish to hold it in terrorem at a certain national expence, when it can be of no national advantage. Especially as compensation may be made you, in various ways, for ceding these things. Among other benefits you may hope from the cession are these, the saving of men and money; neither of which you abound in. A return of the sweets of American commerce, which a continuance of hostilities may deprive you of for ever; and a certain and firm guarantee of all your American possessions. Great-Britain and Ireland condensed within themselves, will become more powerful than with their late domains. Being not so easily attacked, their defence will be less expensive. They will be more capable of offence, because their force will not be employed in the protection of distant possessions. You can have nothing to apprehend from us, because our system is from its nature, and must be from necessity, pacific and commercial. You will become more populous, because you will not suffer the same waste of men from emigrations, garrisons, &c. By admitting a representation from Ireland, your government might be simplified so as to become active and efficacious. It is no paradox to say, that your manufactures would be in a more flourishing situation. Those in which you cannot rival other nations, might languish; but those which are natural to you, and being derived from your own resources, do not depend upon fortuitous incidents: These would be benefited by the accession of that money, labor, and ingenuity, which is now directed to other objects. And as these manufactures are not precarious,  the wealth of a country might safely be rested upon them. It is a mistake, that exclusive privileges are advantageous. The character of a monopolizer is as odious, applied to a nation, as it is to a man, and as unprofitable as it is contemptible. But I beg pardon, Sir, for political disquisitions to so refined a politician, and for mentioning the means of peace to one enamoured of war. To the force of necessity; to the embarrassment of your finances; to that wheel of fortune which you wish not to be thrown out of, and whose revolutions will place your country as low in this as she was high in the last war; to these I leave you. When all other views are precluded, then you will see your true interests, and then you will join in a prayer for peace with Your most obedient and humble servant,  AN AMERICAN MS not found; reprinted from the Pennsylvania Packet; or thc General Advertiser, March 11, 1779, where it appears under the heading \""For the Pennsylvania Packet. To Governor Johnstone.\""  1 Writing over his often-used pseudonym \""An American,\"" Gouverneur Morris wrote this public reply to George Johnstone in response to Johnstone's November 27, 1778, speech to Parliament explaining the failure of the Carlisle Peace Commission. Extracts from his speech to Parliament had been printed in the Pennsylvania Packet of February 11, 1779, and more extensive extracts were printed in the March 9 issue of that newspaper.  The fortunes of George Johnstone and the Carlisle Commission can be traced in many documents printed in volumes 10 and 11 of these Letters.

  My Dear Betsy Philade March 7. 1779. Yesterday your obliging Letter of the 3d of February was deliverd to me by Mr. Hoskins.(1) I thank you for the Concern you express for my Health, which through the Divine Favor I again enjoy as usual. The Advice you give me on this Head shall be duly regarded.  Your Wish that I would resign the Office of Secretary perfectly coincides with my own Inclination. (2) I never sought for that or any other Place. Indeed I never was pleasd with it, for Reasons which you are not unacquainted with. I am very sorry for Mr___ (3) that he should treat me with Unkindness. I never gave any just occasion for it; but if he was bid to do it, how could he disobey? I heartily forgive him, for I do verily believe it did not proceed from the Malevolence of his Heart ! To do him Justice I must say he is a good naturd Man, and would do the Duties of that office better than I should. But if he depends upon the Interest of a certain popular Gentleman (4) he may be disappointed; for he proposd last Summer to Mr L,(5) who mentiond it to me with a generous Disdain. But a Change of Place oftentimes induces a Change of Opinion, and even a Promise made in York Town or Philadelphia, may be forgot in the Hurry of Affairs in Boston. I do not think Mr A (6) is my Enemy; or if he is, I am under no great Apprehensions from it. There are others who are of much more Consideration, at least in their own Estimation than he; and even those might upon certain Conditions be made my Friends. I mean as much my Friends as they are or can be to one another. A few flattering Speeches to this Man, and a Promise to that, of a Vote & Interest to keep him snug in the Possession of Places & Emoluments would effectually secure their gracious Smiles. But who would condescend to such Baseness for the Friendship of any Man? Let those who can do this, enjoy the Fruits of it. I do not covet them upon such Terms. I should become contemptible in my own Eyes; and you know that I had rather be despisd by all the World, hard as my Fate would be, than to be conscious to my self that I deservd Contempt.  I receivd a Letter a few Days ago from France dated the 7th of December,(7) in which my patriotick Friend Arthur Lee is mentiond in Terms of the highest Confidence and Respect. I will give you the following Extracts. \""Your old Friend is a Man of Honor and Integrity\""-\""He has been of Opinion that the publick Money has been too freely issued here, and has often opposd it.\"" \""Insinuations, I have been told, have been made in Court against him, that he was too friendly to the English, too much attachd to Lord Shelburne, and even that he corresponded with his Lordship and communicated Intelligence to him.

  My Dear Sir, Philadelphia 7th March 1779 Your favor of the 6th Feby came to hand the 3d Inst. (1) I am happy to find the calling in so considerable a sum is attended with so little inconveniency, this circumstance leads me to hope you will be able to raise a much larger sum by Tax than is recommended for the Current Year, it is needless for me to point out the great advantage it will be to the state to Tax as high as the People can possibly bear, it is evident that every one must see it. I have never yet heard whether the Continental Tax for the last Year has been Collected, if it has I think Congress ought to have been made acquainted with it. I wonder much that a Court of Law should be in doubt whether a Resolution of Congress can superceed the Law of a Sovereign State, however I hope in time N.H. as well as the other States will feel the importance of Sovereignty.  A Report prevails to day that Genl Lincoln has had an action with the Enemy in Georgia & gain'd considerable advantage.(2) We have also an accot. which is said to be brot. by a vessel to Alexandria from France that two Frigates had taken 20 sail of British Transport with 1600 soldiers on board bound from Ireland to America & carried them into Port L'Oriant. If these Stories are true Perhaps a confirmation of them may arrive before I close this.  You seem very desirous for peace; in that I most heartily concur with you, But in order to obtain such a peace as will establish happiness in America, we ought to make the most Strenuous exertions for war. We ought to be United in Council & Formidable in the Field. I hope this will  MARCH 7, 17 79  be the case, and that this Campaign will put an end to the cruel ravages so distressing to every humane heart.  How are you like to go on with your Constitution? I suppose while you were here you collected all those that have been formed by the different states, I have seen several, but there is none pleases me so well as that proposed by the Convention of the County of Essex.

  Dear Sir, Phila. 8 March 1779. I had the honor to write you the 20th Ultimo, and now embrace the opportunity of transmitting a Pamphlet lately published,(1) together with the Newspapers.  By the latter you will perceive that animosities run high, between Genl Arnold and the Executive branch of this State, in so much, that I fear it may form parties in the Congress, & thereby injure the public Weal, especially at this critical juncture, when their whole thoughts should be employed in collecting force to oppose the common Enemy the ensuing Campain, which I think will be the Severest we have hitherto had, unless Spain Shd Soon acknowledge our Independency.  By advices lately from Europe, we are informed, that G.B. is determined to exert all the Force she can collect, against us, and tho' she can expect no considerable Allies, therefore dispairs of her power to subjugate America, yet it is said she is determined to carry on a predatory war, by burning our Towns & Villages on the Sea Coast, and employing the Savages to harass our frontiers.  It is announced by a paragraph in a New York paper of the 27th Ultimo, that Admiral K___ple(2) was Shot, the Genls. Bourgoyne & Prescot Broke, & that Genl H___ e(3) was on his tryal before a Court Marshal.  This year must one way or the other determine our fate. G.B. if unsuccessfull this Campain, will not be able to carry on another in America to effect, their resources both of money & men are greatly exhausted, and it is my opinion that ours is in the same predicament.

  My dear Sir Philade March 9-79 Mr Hoskins, who arrivd here a few days ago, was kind enough to deliver to me your favor of the 7th of Feb.(1) It gave me a particular pleasure, because I was convincd that you had not totally forgot your old Friend. You see, I rank my self among your friends. How often have we chatted together by the fire side, and settled essential Points to mutual Satisfaction. Yet we have not always thought alike of Men who have conducted the noble Contest for the Rights of our Country, which we have been & are still engagd in. I congratulate my Countrymen on our having thus far got through the Conflict, but we are still engagd in it. And I repeat it, because while too many of our Countrymen are flattering themselves with the airy Prospect of Peace, Britain, if we may credit our latest & best  MARCH 9, 1779  Accounts from Europe, is preparing for a vigorous Campaign. It is prudent for us to enquire of the Watchman What of the Night? The Caution given us on another occasion may with propriety be adapted to this. Be ye ready, lest when the Time of Danger approaches, ye be found distracted with the eager Pursuit of Riches, or sleeping in the delusive Lap of pleasure & Dissipation. But this is a Digression from the intended Subject of my Letter. You ask my opinion of two Men who have lately appeared on the publick Stage; and with your usual Frankness, express your own opinion without a Doubt, that Congress will soon convince the one of his Folly & the other of his Weakness. But have you not misunderstood the Characters of these Men? Has not the first by his artful Address conceald his Weakness from the publick Eye, while the other, by an improper Use of the Weapons in his hands, has given Advantage to his Adversary, and thereby discovered his Folly. Mr Dean had in his first Publication said so much as to make it necessary that some other Person should say more. Common Sense undertook the Task and producd stubborn & undeniable facts, but not contenting himself with relating such facts only as were pertinent to his Argument, he gave Occasion to the Swarms of Writers against him to avail themselves, by diverting the Attention of his Readers from the proper Point. I will mention an Instance. After he had provd to the Satisfaction of every one, that the Cannon & Stores forwarded to America by Mr Deane, had been negociated by Mary Johnson (2) & Beaumarchais before his Arrival in France, and consequently that the Merit of the Negociation did not belong to Mr Dean, what Necessity was there for Common Sense to mention them as a Present? It was nothing to his purpose; And it was too delicate a Subject for him to touch upon, or to attempt to prove if it had been true. His prudence therefore and even his Veracity was called in Question by his Adversaries, and his Authority & Influence as a Writer of facts lessend. The faithful Historian however, will hereafter unfold the secret Politicks of the present Day. The News paper Writings of these two Men, have drawn not only the Conduct but the Characters of others into Dispute. Had Mr Dean been only called upon explicitly to state his Charges, if he had any, against Dr Lee, I believe he would not have attempted it, and a Scrutiny of any Mans Character but his own would have been unnecessary. Although he has insinuated many things against the Doctor, & steppd aside from the Line of Propriety & Decency to bring in Invective, yet I do not recollect that he has explicitly criminated him in either, nor do I believe it is in his Power. If no one steps forward to accuse him, why should his Integrity be doubted? Why should you, my Friend, express yourself in so languid a Tone, \""I cant yet but have a great opinion of Dr Lee,\"" and \""rather than the Cause of America should be betrayd I would give up the dearest Connections I have on Earth.\"" Has Dr Lee forfeited the good opinion you \""always had\"" of him? Do you doubt his Integrity & Attachment to the Cause of America? Has any one chargd him with Mal Conduct? Shall the mere Insinuations & angry Reflections of a disappointed Man lessen your good opinion of one whom  you know to have been, early, decided, active, persevering and inflexible in the Cause of America? If this should be the prevailing Disposition, what honest Man will be safe? The consistent Patriot, after having endurd Fatigue & Danger for the Establishment of publick Liberty, would find himself still in the greatest Perils among his own Countrymen. I will say nothing decisively of Mr Dean at present; but I woud assure you of one thing, that were I connected with Dr Lee as a publick Man, and conscious of my own Tardiness, I should think I had every thing to apprehend, not from a peevish, fretful Temper with which interrested Men have attempted to stigmatize him, but from his stern Virtue and Republican Jealousy. I may be partial to Dr Lee. I confess I feel the strongest Obligation to him, for the eminent Services he renderd to America when he was in England, and to the Massachusetts Bay in particular. I hope my Countrymen are not all ungrateful. Some of them, I have been taught to believe are so; otherwise the publick Character of an old Servant would not have been aspersd, nor wd it have been said, as I am informd it has, that he had been bribd to desert his Country. It is his honorable Lot to have Enemies. Honorable, because he flatters himself his Enemies are among the weak & the wicked. I leave my own Character, under God, in the Care of my virtuous fellow Citizens. I will contend for Dr Lees, because I am his Friend; and I am his friend, because I have long had abundant Reason to be convinced that he is a Friend to our Country. I have said I may be thought partial to him. Be pleasd then to take the Testimony of another, and show it to his Friends and his Enemies. \""Your old friend,\"" says [one], \""is a Man of Honor and Integrity.\"" \""He has been of opinion that the publick Monies have been too freely issued here, & has often opposd it.\"" Let me remark here that it is no Wonder he has exposd himself to the Resentment of a Man thro whose hands the Chief to the money passed. \""Insinuations, I have been told, have been made at Court against your old friend that he was too friendly to the English, too much attachd to Ld Shelburne & even that he corresponded with his Lordship & communicated Intelligence to him. This, whoever suggested it, I am perfectly conf dent was a cruel Calumny.

  To the Public. Camp on Raritan, March 9th. 1779. In Mr. Dunlap's Paper of the 2d March, I find myself mention'd by a Writer, under the Signature of T.G. as a Person, who, during the Time I had the Honor of representing the State of New York in Congress, had officiously interfer'd in the Politics of Pensilvania, in Consequence of which, I had become \""the Hatred, and Contempt of many of the Inhabitants.(1) I feel no Emotion of Resentment either at the Charge, or against the Person, who has made it. The Accusation, I am conscious, is not well grounded; and I have Reason to think the Writer firmly believed he asserted what was Truth. This Opinion is founded on my Knowledge of the Pains, which have been industriously taken to circulate the Opinion by some Delegates of Congress, with whose political Sentiments and Conduct, I am not asham'd to think mine has frequently differ'd, and who have probably, by these Means, intended to divert the public Attention from the Intrigues, which they have sedulously fomented in the State of Pensilvania from the first Formation of their present Constitution, to this day. There is no Calumny, however gross, which may not, by an Artful Combination of some Circumstances, and Suppression of others, be made to assume a plausible Complexion. This is the Case with that, which has been circulated against me. My acquaintance for some Years past has been with many of those Gentlemen in Pensilvania, whose Sentiments and Conduct were Openly opposed to the present Constitution of that State. During my Residence there, the Conversation in Company with those Persons frequently turn'd (as it may naturally be supposed) upon the Form of their Government; on which Occasions, I often exprest my Sentiments of what appear'd to me defective in it, with that Freedom, which every Person, whether Resident in, or Citizen of the State, had a Right to do; and which I am conscious no Freind to the Liberties of Mankind can be offended with; because Discussions of this Nature tend to investigate that System of Government, which bids fairest to promote, and Secure the Happiness, and Liberties of the People, for whose Benefit all Government ought to be instituted. If this can be call'd an Interference in State Politics, I may with as much Propriety charge many Gentlemen of the State of Pensilvania,(2) with having intermeddled in the Politics of almost every State in the Union; because I have heard the various Constitutions frequently canvassed, and many Parts of them severely reprobated. Those, MARCH 9, 1779  who know how fine a Web Suspicion will Spin, when Party Spirit runs high (which unhappily has been for some Time the Case in Pensilvania) will not be Surprised that the Circumstances, which I have mention'd should operate in the Manner they have done. It is not improbable, they may have derived Strength, either from a Wrong Conception of some Parts of my Conduct in Congress, when Affairs relative to the State of Pensilvania were in Agitation, or from an Uncandid Representation of it by designing Persons without Doors.  I shall mention the material Instances, which, I have been inform'd by reputable Citizens of the State, have been made Use of to Strengthen the Suspicion, that I have officiously intermeddled in the Politics of Pensilvania, together with the Motives of my Conduct; and I shall then leave it to the dispassionate Judgment to determine, whether the Part I acted as a Trustee for the general Interest of America was reprehensible, or praiseworthy.  The principal Circumstance of this Nature, which I have heard alledged, was my promoting a Measure in Congress for Exercising certain Acts of Power in the State of Pensilvania, during the Recess of the Executive Authority in the Spring 1777. The Simple Account of this Transaction is as follows.  Soon after I took my Seat in Congress as a Delegate from the State of New York,(3) the Enemy meditated an Attempt upon the City of Philadelphia through the State of New Jersey. The legislative Authority of the State of Pensilvania was adjourn'd, and by the Absence of some of the members of the Supreme Executive Council, a sufficient Number were not left in the City to Exercise Powers, essential to its Safety, and to the general Wellfare. (4) Representations were frequently made to Congress and to Individual Members of vast Quantities of Provisions and other Articles being stord in the City, which, if it fell into the Hands of the Enemy, would greatly benefit them, and be materially miss'd by our Army. A Removal of these Stores was strongly urg'd by General Washington to Congress, and by them judg'd Expedient. The Question then arose how this Measure was to be Executed, as there was no Authority in the State vested with Powers adequate to the End. On Motion made in Congress (I beleive by myself) a Committee was appointed to confer with the President of the State, the Members of the Pensilvania Board of War, and Such Gentlemen of the Executive Council as were in Town, on the Mode of Authority necessary to be Exercised in the State of Pensilvania, during the Recess of the Executive Council.(5) The Committee consisted of the Delegates of Pensilvania, Mr. John Adams, Mr. R.H. Lee, and myself. After a mature Deliberation, it was determin'd in the Committee of Conference, without a Dessintient Voice, to report, \""That Congress should declare it as their Opinion that, considering the threaten'd Invasion of the State, and the Recess of the Legislative, and Executive Powers, the President of the State, the Members of the Pensilvania Board of War, and Such of the Executive Council as were in the City should Excercise such   Acts of Power, as were essential to the Safety of the State, and to the General Weal: and that it should be earnestly recommended to the Inhabitants chearfully to Submit to this Authority.\"" Upon these Principles, a Report was drafted, and Submitted to Congress; and Such was the Conviction of the Propriety of the Measure at that Time, that (if my Memory does not deceive me) it pass'd without a Division; certain I am, if there was any, it was very insignificant in the Negative. If any Censure can with Propriety be thrown out against the Promoters of this Measure, why not extend it to all the Members of the Committee? Why not, to the Gentlemen of the State, with whom they Conferr'd, and who were Unanimous in the Report? Why not to Congress, who Concurr'd in it? The Truth is, there is no just Plea for Censure: and, though there is no Person more tenacious than myself of preserving from the Encroachment of Congress the Exercise of the Internal Polity of the respective States, I will venture to give it as my Opinion, that if Congress, during what I may call this Interregnum in Pensilvania, and when the State was hourly threaten'd with an Invasion, had actually Excercised by themselves, or a Committee, every Power in that State necessary for its Safety, and for the common Interest, they would have been strictly justified. I will go further, and Say, that if they had neglected adopting this or a Similar Measure, they would have been unworthy the high Trust vested in them by the People of America. Their Powers were not limited by any Article of Confederation; their Object was to carry on the War in the most effectual Manner against the Common Enemy, and to SuperIntend the general Weal. I remember that in the Conversation, and Writings of some Persons at that Time, who disapproved of the Constitution of Pensilvania, this necessary Interference of Congress was made Use of to the Prejudice of the Government, and of those who Exercised it; and as I was intimate with many, who were open in their Disapprobation of the Constitution, it is not to be wonder'd that Jealousies should be Entertain'd against me in particular, as being Active in promoting a Measure, which the Partisans of the Constitution considered as an Engine of Opposition.  This Transaction, I beleive, laid the Foundation of those Suspicions, which the Writer under the Signature of T.G. mentions. Other Circumstances occurr'd in the Discharge of my public Trust, which, I am told, were perverted to Strengthen them. It will sometimes happen that the Legislatures of the respective States (however pure, and patriotic their Intentions may be) pass Laws, which in their Operation not only defeat the very Object they have in Veiw, but often clash with the general Weal. In the latter Case I conceive it to be the indispensable Duty of Congress to recommend to the Legislatures of the States enacting such Laws, a Repeal, or Revisal of them. Of this Nature I considerd the Laws of Pensilvania allowing the Commutation of personal Service, in the Militia, by the Hire of Substitutes, and that relative to the Quarter Masters Department enacted in the Winter 1777-8. The first Law, in its Consequences naturally tended to impede the Recruiting Service for the Confederal Army,  and to Encourage Desertions from the Quotas of other States, by tempting the Soldiers to follow the profitable Trade of a Militia-Substitute. I shall not insist on the Evil of its introducing a Mercenary Principle, in lieu of that Ardor Patrioe, or Love of Country, which ought to animate the Militia and which is the only Basis, that can render it formidable. Frequent Representations were made of the ill Effects of this Law by many Officers of Repute in the Army, particularly, Several in the Pensilvania Line. In Consequence of which, it was determin'd by the Board of War (of which I was a Member) to report a Resolution to Congress, recommending the Repeal of it (6) This Resolution I was desir'd to draft; and, as I knew the Jealousy, which the Government of Pensilvania entertain'd (7) of Congress' animadverting on their Laws, particularly when they chanc'd to originate from me, I drew up a general Resolution, recommending to the Legislatures of all the States a Repeal of Such Part of their Militia Laws, as permitted the Engaging of Substitutes. In the Course of the Debates on this Subject, the Generality of the Resolution was objected to, particularly by some Members of the Eastern States, who said that Laws allowing Substitutes in the Militia Existed in the States, they represented; but that they were so qualified as not to produce those ill Consequences, which flow'd from the Pensilvania Law; (8) a Circumstance which I am inform'd gave Umbrage, and Subjected me to fresh Jealousy.  The Law respecting the Quarter-Master's Department (though probably meant to prevent those Abuses, which I am sorry to say too many of the Citizens of these States have Suffer'd from Persons Employ'd in the Subordinate Branches) render'd the Process of procuring Teams so Extremely tedious, as, by an Adherence to it, to subject the Army to a precarious Supply. Many Representations were made of this to the Board of War, and at one Time in particular, the Critical State of the Army for Want of Provisions was Such, as to give just Ground of Alarm, that they would be obliged to disband, unless the most Speedy, and Vigorous Measures were adopted for their Releif. In Consequence of this, Congress pass'd a Resolution, directing the Board of War to take the most Effectual Measures for forwarding Supplies to the Army. The Board immediately order'd out Parties of arm'd Men under the Command of discreet, and Active Officers in the Pensilvania Line to impress a Number of Waggons (particularly from the disaffected) in Lancaster, and the Adjacent Counties, and to forward them loaded with Flour, and other Provisions for the Use of the Army. The Order was Executed with Spirit, Prudence, and Diligence; and in Consequence of it, a Considerable Supply of Flour arrived at a Time, when the Army had been Compell'd for some Days to range the Country, and distress the Inhabitants in order to procure a Scanty Subsistance. This Measure, I confess, was a Violation of the Law of the State; but if there is any Crisis in the Affairs of a Nation in which Laws must Sleep; (and Experience proves there is) that, which has been mention'd, was one. The Situation of the Army was desperate; an immediate, and Vigorous Remedy was necessary. The Powers then Exerted by   the Board have been frequently Exercised on less urgent Occasions in the different States, without Exciting those Murmurs, which, from the Jealousy then Existing in Pensilvania, were at that Time Exprest against those concern'd in the Execution of this Measure: notwithstanding the Safety of the State of Pensilvania, which depended on the Army's keeping Embodied, was so immediately involved in it.  The last Circumstance I shall mention (on which it is said great Stress has been laid) is the Uniform Opposition, I have lately given in Congress to Advances of Money, being made to the State of Pensilvania from the Continental Treasury. This has been misrepresented as flowing from a Desire to obstruct the Execution of the present Government. Nothing was more foreign from my Intention. The Object I had in Veiw was general, not partial. Since the Commencement of the present War, the different States in the Union have, from time to time applied for Advances of Money out of the Continental Treasury, for the Purpose of paying Debts contracted on Continental Account, and, in some Instances, the Contingent Expence of their Government. The Sums, which have been advanced to the different States are prodigiously unequal; and none of these Accounts have been adjusted. It appear'd to me of infinite Consequence, in order to maintain that Harmony between the States, so Essential to their Union, and Safety, that all these Accounts should be liquidated without delay; and, that instead of applying to Congress for further Advances of money, the States should have Recourse to deep Taxation, the only radical Cure for the grand political Disease. These Ends I knew would be best Effected, by not making any further Advances to the respective States; and, upon this Principle, I opposed Grants of Money for some Time past, not only to Pensilvania, but to the other States in the Union.  This Conduct of mine, and my Reasons for it must be well known to many Members of Congress; and must be particularly remember'd by the Honble. Mr. R. Morris, on an Application which not long Since he made to Congress for an Advance of Money to the State of Pensilvania. I pertinaciously opposed this Advance, and if my Opposition had been founded on the disgraceful Principle imputed to me, it is not to be presum'd, I should have Continued it, when the Measure was advocated by a Gentleman, openly averse to the present Constitution, and with whom I was intimate both in private, and political Life.  Every Person, who has been a Delegate to Congress, must know that it is utterly impracticable to discharge, with a becoming Firmness, and Integrity, that Duty, which a Person, vested with so high a Trust, owes to America in general, without oftentimes giving Offence to Individuals, and Sometimes to States. When I accepted of the honorable Trust reposed in me, I never Expected to avoid giving Offense-my only Study was not to give just Grounds for it. I therefore spoke, acted, and voted with Boldness; and left it to others, who might have Sinister Purposes to carry, either for their States or themselves, to shew a Temper of Forbearance and Com  plaisance, at the Expence too often of the Treasure, and Reputation of the United States.  I have thus laid before the Public a plain State of those material Points, which I have Reason to think have been made an Artful Use of to confirm the Suspicion, that I had been Active in the Political Disputes of the State of Pensilvania. There may perhaps be some others, which I have not heard of, that have been perverted to the same End. I solemnly declare, that I never was concern'd directly, or indirectly in any Writing, or Publication, whatsoever, relative to the political Differences in the State of Pensilvania, or in any Meeting or Conference, with any Individual, or Body of Men, on the Subject of those Differences. Though I oftentimes exprest my Sentiments with Freedom on the Form of their present Constitution, it was in the Company of those whose Way of thinking was very Similar to my Own, and therefore not calculated (had I been even inclin'd) to make Proselites.  I have been induced to enter into this Explanation, not because I am ambitious of Standing forth as a Writer (which, considering the Spirit of many late Publications is no Eligible Character) but, from an Apprehension that my Silence may be construed as an Admission of the Charge. I consider the Interference of any Person in the political Differences of a State, of which he is not a Citizen, during the Time he is a Member of Congress as reprehensible; and I am sensible it would be consider'd in that Light by the People, whom I had the Honor to represent. They have Experienc'd the baneful Effects of the Interference of some Delegates of Congress in the political Differences of their own State; and have Complain'd of it through their Legislature to Congress. Happy would it be for Pensilvania if others had been as innocent of the Accusation thrown out against me, as I am! That the Case is otherwise is so notorious, as to render it unnecessary to point out the Characters. Some of them will probably be found in the Number of those, who, taking Advantage of the distressed Situation of the State of New York, have not only fomented Divisions in it, which might otherwise have been Amicably heal'd; but have, in an insidious Manner, countenanc'd an Open Revolt from the Jurisdiction of that State; thereby Exposing it to all the Miseries of a Civil Contest, and hazarding the Peace, and Union of the general Confederacy.  I feel myself interested in the Happiness, and Safety of Pensilvania, and love its Inhabitants. My ardent Wish is, that she may not, when too late, lament the Effects of the Interference, I have mention'd; but that she may be able to discern her true political Interest, and not Experience the fatal Effects of a dismember'd Jurisdiction, and open Revolt, countenanced perhaps by some of those, who, at present, assume the Mask of Freinds.  In order to fetter my Reputation with that Chain of Suspicion, the Links of which have been so artfully forged, it has been industriously insinuated, that I was on Account of the Impropriety of my public Conduct omitted in the last Nomination of Delegates for the State of New York. The true State of that Matter is as follows. A Close, and unremitted   Attention to public Business, for the Space of three Years, had much Embarrassed my private Affairs, and impair'd my Constitution. I therefore was Constrained to give in my Resignation previous to the last Appointment of Delegates for the State of New York; and assign'd my Reasons for so doing to the Legislature of that State. In a late Letter which I received from the honorable Speaker of the Assembly of New York, he informed me that my Reasons were deem'd Satisfactory by the House, and that he was directed to assure me, that nothing but my having declin'd would have induc'd them to omit me in their present Nomination. Nothing but the Duty, which I owe to my own Reputation compells me to mention this Matter for which (under any other Circumstances) I might Subject myself to the Imputation of Vanity.  Though I have never Courted, I wish to deserve the good Opinion of the People of America; and particularly of the Citizens of my own State, for whose Information principally this Publication is intended.(9) Should I, after all my Exertions, be disappointed in this Object, I shall console myself with the Consciousness of having Endeavor'd to discharge my public Trust with Fidelity to my own State, and to America in General, without dreading the undeserved Censure of Individuals or even of particular States.

  Dear Sir Philadela March the 9th. 1779 My letters intended for the last post did not get in time to the office. Nothing of any importance has turned up since. By a Letter from the General we are informed of some preparations at New-York for the Embarcation of a small Detachment. It is thought they are for Georgia. The Event of the late invasion of Jersey you will see by the papers.  Mr. Hudson has a Letter which is the latest Account from S. Carolina which says, the Enemy in attempting to march to Augusta (which lies high up the Savannah) met with a severe check from Genl. Williams.  Enclosed is a letter from Col Richardson to me respecting Mr. James Gilchrist who is now at New-York and very desirous of returning and residing in Maryland. I did not think it proper to move Congress for a passport, being fully convinced that no such power belongs to them or the Delegates. Who shall be subjects of the State must depend alone upon the will of the State. I should be glad to have your advice and opinion upon this Matter. (1) Should you want any further information concerning this gentleman Col. Richardson will readily give it. I have sent you by this post a pamphlet called observations on the American Revolution as drawn up by a Comtee. of Congress.

  Gentlemen, 9th March 1779. We are exceedingly unhappy in finding that our Letter of the 4th instant excited Emotions of so singular a nature: be assured, we did not mean to wound your feelings in any Degree, much less to such an Extreme.  No Prooffs were wanting to convince us of your Disposition to observe a respectful Attention to Congress and every Member of it; and we consider your's of the 5th instant which we received on the 6th as a clear Confirmation of it. (1)  On the 15th of February General Arnold's Letter to Congress praying an Enquiry and Trial on the Charges contained in the printed Proceedings of Council were referred to us: (2) on the 18th we informed his Excellency the President of it, and solicited the Assistance of Council in the Execution of our Enquiry. It is now the 9th of March, and we have not yet been able to obtain any Assistance or Evidence from You.  You request us to peruse impartially and attentively your's of the 25th of February, (3) which, you say, contains Reasons for not furnishing us with the Evidence on the above Charges. We have complied with your Request, and find that Nothing escaped our first Consideration of it: we did not then, nor do we now, see the force of your Reasoning. You say \""the Resolves of the Board were framed and transmitted to the Members of Congress as to other Persons of Rank & Consequence not as forming a Complaint against General Arnold.\"" Be pleased to recollect, that your Resolves were accompanied with the Reasons, on which you founded them, each of which is a specific Charge against the General: these Resolves and Reasons or specific Charges were, by Order of Council, printed and published: and by Order of Council printed Copies were put into the Hands of the Delegates of Congress: in Consequence of which Measure of Council, & by means of General Arnold's Letter, Congress became possessed of Information, that the General stood charged in the printed Proceedings of Council with Misconduct in no less than Eight Instances. Under these Circumstances, altho' your Conduct, as we have already stated it, clearly demonstrates, that you did not mean to form a Complaint against the General, yet as there was no Disavowal on your Part, or Retraction, of the Charges contained in your Proceedings under the Description of Reasons, public Justice required that Congress should direct an Enquiry; and surely public Justice required that you should furnish the Evidence which you were possessed of.  You say, the Proceedings and Publication of Council in General Arnolds Case are not Charges, but Judgments to which you are fully competent. We do not comprehend the Legality of such Judgments. Common Justice requires, that a Trial & Conviction should precede every Judgment of Condemnation, and common Humanity reprobates all Convictions founded on Ex parte Evidence behind the Back of the party accused.  MARCH 9, 1779  But as you say you are fully competent to the Judgments in General Arnold's Case, we cannot doubt their Legality.  If we have called upon you authoritatively for Evidence, we can only say, that our Letter of the 4th instant must be exprest in Terms very different from what we find in the original Draught of it. We were fully apprized of the Delicacy of your feelings, and perfectly knew what exalted Ideas, you had, of Rank, dignity and Power: whatever therefore may be the Expressions of our Letter, we could not possibly mean to address you in the Stile of Authority.  As to the Complaint about the Waggons, which was made by his Excellency the President to Congress in his Letter of the 25th of January, we finished our Enquiries on that Subject, made up our Report, and offered it to Congress, in less than ten Days after you gave us the Evidence. We made up this Report with all the Expedition, we possibly could, consistently with the Attention due to other publick Business. But before Congress could receive it, the Council of Pensylvania thought proper to make a fresh Exhibition of Charges against the General, in which was included the Complaint about the Waggons.(4) General Arnold immediately addressed Congress and prayed an Enquiry on those other Charges: we were therefore directed by Congress to take the same into Consideration, to make a general Enquiry and to report the Result of such Enquiry. There being now a general Reference of the whole Charges we conceived it improper to report partially, and therefore laid aside the Report on the Complaint about the Waggons with an Intent to include it in our general Report.  What Ideas you mean to hold out, by charging the Majority of our Committee & the Members individually with private Interviews and ex parte Examinations of General Arnold, it is difficult to say: we beg Leave however to deny your Charge in the most explicit Terms. Both of us cannot be right: as you make the Charge, the Onus probandi lies upon you. If you have any Evidence to prove, that your Charge is founded in Truth, considering how flatly we contradict it, you will certainly take the earliest Opportunity of vindicating the Honor & Reputation of Council by producing it.  You seem to have taken up an Idea, that we consider you as Parties & Complainants presenting before Congress the Charges contained in your printed Proceedings: we never considered you in that Light; we consider you merely as Accusers possessed of Evidence to prove a publick Offence. We know of no Parties or Complainants to Congress in the present Case but the Publick & General Arnold: for publick, not private, Justice, public, not private, Reparation, is the Object of all Prosecutions for Offences of a public Nature.  Our Conduct is by no Means opposed to what should be observed by Grand Inquests: for altho' we deny, that we took the Ex parte Examination in favour of the party accused, which with so much Decency you charge upon us, yet we say, it is the Right of the party accused to have an  Examination of his Witnesses by the Grand Inquest before whom he is charged.  Having observed in our last, that fourteen Days had elapsed, since our application to you for Evidence, You are pleased to reply \""as to the fourteen Days you mentioned this Delay surely cannot be attributed to us, when you recollect how great a Part of that Time has been employed in hearing General Arnold & his Aids with other Evidence without Notice to this State as Parties & Complainants.\"" We perfectly recollect the Reverse of what you alledge, and in express Terms declare, that no Part of that Time was employed in Hearing General Arnold & his Aids or in taking other Evidence. General Arnold was never heard on the Charges contained in your printed Proceedings, and referred to us on the 15th of February, till the 5th instant, which was the Day after our Letter, to which you have made your Reply, and of Consequence not within the fourteen Days you mention. The Committee tired out with fruitless Applications to you for Evidence and repeatedly prest by General Arnold for a Hearing, with all the Anxiety & Sensibility of a Soldier, injured in his Honor & Reputation, we resolved on the 3d instant to close our Enquiries on the 5th: both you & the General were notified of it, and you were told, that we did not doubt but your Regard for public Justice would induce you to furnish us by that Time with the Evidence you were possessed of.  We wish for your own Sakes you had spared your solemn Protestation: it is no Prooff of Dignity of Conduct. Vehement Delcarations and violent Protestations are sometimes the Result of Passions roused in the telling of Truths-or the Apprehension of it. We shall certainly make no Report derogatory to the Rights and Interests of Pensylvania: such a Report would only disgrace ourselves. As to the Honor of Council we shall report the Truth: and therefore, if you yourselves have done Nothing derogatory to the Honor of Council, you have nothing to fear from our Report.(5)  I have the Honor to be, Gentlemen, Your most Obedient, humble Servant, Wm.

  Sir, Philadelphia March 9th. 1779. In our last letter we promised your excellency a copy of the act of Congress recommending to the States to the Southward to permit the States of Massa. Bay and Rhode-Island & Providence Plantations to purchase Proviss. in their posts for the supply of their inhabitants. A copy we are informed hath been sent to you by the President. (1) We at the same time promised you a copy of the act reducing our quota of the tax for the current year to two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, which we now do ourselves the honour to inclose, hoping that it will prove agreeable to the Assembly. (2) It was not intended by Congress that the apportionments of the former or present tax should be considered hereafter as their precise just quotas of those taxes. It was impossible to adjust our equitable proportion of the present tax. If it should turn out that we have paid more than our just quota, we shall have credit for the surplusage and the interest thereof; if it should be less we must pay the deficiency with the interest, perhaps in an appretiated currency. We know that there will be difficulty in collecting so large a Sum as two hundred and fifty thousand dollars in our state, under its present deplorable circumstances; but, distressed as it is, we presume that the difficulty will principally arise from the impracticability of apportioning the tax equally among the inhabitants. However we hope that the State will struggle through it.  In a private letter to Mr. Ellery from the Lieut. Governor (3) he is informed that the Authority of our State complain that we do not send them intelligence enough. We could wish to gratify the Assembly in that or any other way; but really we have none to communicate. We mentioned in our last, we believe, that there was no prospect that the British army would receive any reinforcements, this campaign. This is our opinion, and we think it is well-founded. We have not received any Intelligence from Georgia since the first account of the enemy's taking possession of it. Nothing from the W. Indies; nor any thing from Europe that we are at liberty to communicate.  The necessity of a respectable Army in the field this campaign, whether peace or war should be the object, is so apparent as to need no arguments either to evince or illustrate it. A brilliant stroke this might make it the last campaign. Sincerely wishing for an honorable peace, and every blessing to our country and your excellency we are with great respect, Yr. excellencys most obedient, humble Servts, William Ellery  ""

  Sir, Philadelphia, March 9, 1779. The duty I owe to my country, and the respect I have for the gentleman who is published in the Royal Gazette of New York, as the author of three letters taken in the schooner Willis, Capt. Chamberlaine, and carried into New York, induce me to request that you will give those letters a place in your paper: (1) For, if there is a man amongst us who, having professed himself a friend to the Independency of America, hath enjoyed a share of the confidence of his country, and, being instrumental to the calamities which we suffer, would prolong the war by avowing sentiments favorable to the views of Britain, and on which alone her hope of recovering America now rests; he should stand forth, black with hellish guilt, a monument of baseness. If, on the other hand, the letters alluded to are not genuine, the shafts of envy and detraction should not be permitted secretly to wound the reputation of an innocent man; and an opportunity should be given him to defend a character thus attacked, and to remove those suspicions against him, which, at present, are considered as being well founded. (2)  To deceive and alarm the people of America by a misrepresentation of facts, to encrease and confirm in their minds those prejudices against our friends and allies, which had arisen from education and a long connexion with Britain, is not the part of a friend; nor ought they to be trusted who, longing after the flesh pots of Egypt, show a disposition injurious to the honor and interest of these United States, inasmuch as it is unfavorable towards a nation, to whose generous exertions we are indebted for those advantages we have gained over our enemies.  When America first resisted the power of Britain, she had neither friends abroad nor the means of defending herself at home. When the Declaration of Independency issued forth, she was like a ship on the ocean, destitute of sails and rudder, whose safety depended on the expedients of her navigators-the offspring of necessity. Then it was that we courted the favor and assistance of France; and, with acknowledgments bordering upon folly, received the supplies of her meanest adventurers. Sensible of the weakness of our state, we thought nothing was so essential to our safety and happiness, as the countenance and protection of that nation. But she hath no sooner stretched our her hand to save us, than we have begun to give her proofs of our perfidious disposition.  The account which Governor Johnstone hath given of the situation of our affairs, is not entirely without foundation.(3) There is too much reason to conclude, from a variety of circumstances, that he hath sufficient grounds for his assertions; and it behoves every true friend to the liberty and interest of America, at this critical period, to examine narrowly into the conduct of those in whom even the greatest confidence is placed. Men who were enemies to the cause of Independency in the beginning of the contest, openly opposed the measures that were taken in support of it,  MARCH 9, 1779  until restrained by laws that rendered their safety precarious; and, although it frequently happens that such men will change their professions, and go with the tide of popularity it seldom happens that they forsake their opinions. Ye shall know them by their fruits. On the other hand, patriotism is a virtue which few men possess, and a real patriot, of distinguished abilities to serve his country, is a jewel of inestimable value. But the views of patriots, in the common acceptation of the word, are, like those of priests, directed towards themselves; and they generally make the same use of that implicit confidence which is reposed in them by the people.  I rejoice that America resisted; not because I disliked her rulers, but that the liberty and happiness of her people might be established on a solid basis. It is not likely, therefore, that I shall change the object of my first pursuit, to accommodate those whose friendship I esteem, or to promote their aggrandizement. I own, I reject that system of philosophy which makes all mens actions modifications of self-love, as a pernicious theory subversive of morality; whilst I esteem the man whose self-love is so directed as to be subservient to the public good. But ambition and the love of money are always dangerous, and very often prove ruinous, to those who are under their influence. They frequently oblige men to assume the despicable character of a trimmer; and, whilst they imagine that they walk in the paths of consummate wisdom, and deceive the world, they seldom fail to deceive themselves. He is a bad politician who is yet to learn the true interest of these United States, in their relation to Europe; and he is a weak one, indeed, who cannot determine whether the measures at present pursued, are calculated to promote it.  MS not found; reprinted from the Pennsylvania Packet; or thc General Advertiser, March 18, 1779.  1 These intercepted letters, printed by James Rivington in the Royal Gazette on February 3 1779, were written by Carter Braxton, a former delegate to Congress from Virginia, to mercantile associates in France and Holland.  2 Braxton's letters contained a number of passages that Smith believed would discredit him. In a communication of December 26, 1778, to John Ross in Nantes, Braxton wrote disparagingly of \""designing\"" French ministers who had deceived the United States by altering provisions of the treaty to France's advantage. He also castigated Arthur, Richard Henry, and William Lee for their roles in the \""trial\"" of Silas Deane in Congress. Concerning the charges that Deane had made in his December 5 address in the Pennsylvania Packet, Braxton stated that \""I am exceeding well acquainted with the character of the Lee's, and know them to be actuated by such base principles, and full of such artifice, and intrigue, that no new proof was necessary to fix my opinion.... I had long seen the impropriety of entrusting the secrets of America with men of such characters, but it was not to be prevented. R. H. Lee's interest in Congress, joined to that of the eastern states, was too great to be withstood.\"" Further, in a letter of the following day to the firm of George, Clifford & Tysett in Holland, Braxton wrote that \""with respect to our future trade in case of peace, there is not a doubt but your nation and Great-Britain would partake of three-fourths of it: For although we are reluctantly, and I fear imprudently tied to France, during the war, yet that being over, the people will break through every restraint or punctilio, to return to England for the goods they formerly purchased, after which they long and pine every day of the year.\"" In a third letter of January 12, 1779, to Campbell, Beale & Co., Braxton outlined a plan to  resume shipment of British goods to America during wartime by way of the British West Indies and then the Dutch islands.  By requesting that Braxton's letters be reprinted in the Pennsylvania Packet, Meriwether Smith apparently hoped to embarrass both Braxton and the Lees. It is apparent that Smith regarded Braxton as a \""trimmer,\"" and he would soon be instrumental in the movement to recall Arthur Lee from Paris. See Henry Laurens' Notes of Debates, May 6, 1779. That there was a growing animosity between Smith and the Lees is evident also from a letter of August 1, 1779, from Richard Henry Lee to Henry Laurens in which Lee said \""I think with infinite contempt and a good degree of detestation of my Compatriot M. S. If he produces papers that can in any matter affect my character, I affirm they are forgeries, and thus I have done with him.\"" See Lee, Letters (Ballagh), 2:99-100.  For his part, Braxton attempted to minimize damage to his reputation with an explanation to the public dated March 15, 1779, which appeared in the Virginia Cazette (Purdie, March 20?, 1779, no copy known to exist) and was reprinted on April 8, 1779, in the Pennsylvania Packet Braxton included transcripts from his letterbooks of the three captured letters that had appeared in the Royal Gazette, which he claimed he had not yet seen, but chose to omit the paragraph quoted above from his letters to George, Clifford & Tysett concerning the future resumption of trade with Great Britain. He was at great pains, through published testimonials from his clerk, George Seaton, and officials in Williamsburg, to demonstrate that his letterbooks contained numerous expressions in favor of \""the independence of America.\"" It is clear, however, that Braxton's opinions about the conditions necessary for independence, which had been poorly received by his constituents, had changed little since he lost his seat in Congress in 1776. See these Letters, 3:520-23; 4:18-21, 228, 8:183, 202-3 and Jefferson, Papers (Boyd), I :475. For comments on the effect in Virginia of the publication of Braxton's letters, see Edmund Pendleton, The Letters and Papers of Edmund Pendleton, 1734-1803, ed. by David J. Mays, 2 vols. (Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, 1967), 1:278-80; and the letters of March 12, 16, 21, 30, and April 8 from Richard Parker, Mann Page, and William Aylett to Richard Henry Lee in the Lee Family Papers microfilm, viu ViU.  Finally, although Braxton explained in the Virginia Gazette that in his acrimonious observations about the French treaty, \""no reflection was intended on the French Ministers, or Mons. Gerard,\"" he refused to apologize for his attack on the characters of the Lees. This occasioned a public exchange between Arthur Lee and Braxton in the Virginia Gazette (Dixon & Nicolson). See the issues of October 9, 1779 (reprinted in the Pennsylvania Packet, October 28, 1779), and October 23, 1779. For further evidence of the deteriorating relationship between Braxton and the Lees, see Lee, Letters (Ballagh), 2:64, 68, 71, 102, 122, 150; and William Lee, Letters of William Lee, ed. Worthington C. Ford, 3 vols. (Brooklyn, N.Y.: Historical Printing Club, 1891), 2:536n, 596, 634, 651; and 3:734. Braxton's conservative political stance and ambitious mercantile pursuits are described in L. Tomlin Stevens, \""Carter Braxton: Signer of the Declaration of Independence\"" (Ph.D. diss., Ohio State University, 1969); and Alonzo T. Dill, Carter Braxton, Virginia Signer: A Cnservative in Revolt (Lanham, Md.: University Press of America, 1983).  3 See Gouverneur Morris to George Johnstone, March 4, 1779, note 1.

Dont apologize for Egotisms, for I would much rather receive them than not. Unless the Pain my last occasioned was severe, I dont regret it. That You have deserved well of your Country is agreed, and that you became latterly a little relaxed, is not disputable. You have never been thrown out or distanced in the Pursuit of Virtue, but like some game Horses, you sometimes want a Whip. This is a coarse Simile. Friendship will pardon it.  That full Confidence which enduced You to think loud, flatters me. The like Return is due and shall be paid, but Letters in our Days are dangerous Conveyances of our Sentiments on many Subjects. I seldom write without adverting to the Consequences of a Miscarriage, and hence the Reserve & Caution which mark all such of mine, as are trusted to common Carriers or doubtful Bearers.  The State of your Politics is much as I expected. I fear some of your Measures are more severe than Wisdom or Humanity will justify. Posterity will think dispassionately & probably condemn, especially when informed, that they were hast'ned, lest the Influence of Resentment should be lost.  My Silence on a certain Subject arose from reflecting that an Explanation ought not to be on Paper.(2) The Probability of it turns on an Event not yet determined.

  Dr General. Phila. 14th March 1779. You will excuse in me the Liberty I have taken in requesting Colo.  Morgan to call on you. That Gentleman can give you much and impor- MARCH 14,1779  tant Information relative to the State of our Western Frontiers. From the first View of the Commander in that Department at York Town he struck me as one of those who excell in the Regularity of Still Life from the Possession of an indolent Uniformity of Soul. The little Eagerness he shewed to go thence when every Thing almost depended on Vivacity gave no good Omen of his Success. I observed in Silence & untill this Moment no one hath known any Reflections I then made and perhaps I am even at this Moment much very much deceived. When I heard of some Proceedings in the Department I ventured to say aloud that no Good would follow from the Exertions of the Army under his Command. Unfortunately I have not been mistaken. I have Reason to beleive that his Recall hath become necessary from a Variety of Causes. (1) For a Successor I think you will be puzzled. Good Sense, Genius, Activity and a Habit of Business. These are Qualities which appear to me better adapted to this Office than all the military Science in all the military Books put together. Excuse one more Observation. It is that the Reason why a good Partizan Officer is so rare a Thing among regular Soldiers may be deduced from this that in order to become such, a Man must unlearn all that he has learnt or the greater Part of it which few have good Sense enough to do. One good Mohawk would on such Occasion do more with one hundred Men than Prince Ferdinand with a thousand or Braddock with ten thousand. I must here again beg your Pardon for intermeddling with Things out of my Line and beyond my Reach. But you will I am sure excuse me for thinking loud to you upon a Subject which presses itself upon my Sensibilities, especially when I assure you what I beleive you Well know that such Liberties with you arise from personal Confidence & Esteem. I believe it is unnecessary for me to say that Colo. Morgan is a Man of Honor and Truth as he is of your Acquaintance but as you may not know him so well as to know how much he may be relied on permit me to assure you that I have the highest Reason to beleive that you cannot derive Information from a more certain Source or thro a surer Channel.(1) Adieu. My Respects to Mrs. Washington who I am told has no Great Opinion of me as a Christian Priest and yet I am sure we are of the same Religion expressed in the one Word Benevolence.  Yours, Gouv.

  Sir Philadelphia March 15th. 1779  The inclosed papers are referred to us by Congress, and we wish for the assistance of your Ideas to enable us to make a more perfect report. We request you therefore to take the trouble of committing to paper your Opinion on the proposed terms for the exchange of Prisoners in the Southern department, and also any thing which you think will conduce to that End without Contravening your general Arrangements or general policy and utility. (1)  We deem it inconvenient, in an inadmissable degree, to permit an exchange of mere Citizens. The facility with which our Enemy can make Prisoners of our Citizens, the difficulty of our making adequate reprisals, and many other circumstances incline us to this Opinion. It seems even better to Suffer the captivity of Such as unfortunately fall into their hands, for tho' this is a calamity which greatly affects our Sensibility, yet it is far Short of what we Apprehend from admitting Such exchange. We think it must Necessarily prove an incentive to the making a greater Number of Prisoners of that Order, and that the Efforts for making them would be attended with an increase of ravage and horror which we are not in a Condition to prevent or Chastise. We shall also be very glad to be informed by You whether any reinforcements of regular Troops can be spared to the Southern department and if in your Opinion any be Necessary. At the Same time we Suggest that North Carolina is making very Considerable Exertions for raising a reinforcement of Militia, both Cavalry and Infantry. We think you Concur with us in Opinion that Militia forces ought to be employd only in Cases where they cannot be dispensed with.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia March 15, 1779 I have not been unmindful of the small commission you gave me to procure the song and receipt for you. I once had these, but they are mislaid so that I could not find them when I returned home from Williamsburg, or they should have been sent from thence. I have here applied to Mr. Peters for the one, and to Mrs. Shippen for the other and I have hopes of getting them both. I send you herewith a small pamphlet containing a collection of such papers and proceedings as clearly defeats the calumny of the British Commissioners charging this war to our ambition, (1) when the Tyranny and avarice of the British Court most indubitably produced and has continued it.  That our enemies will not get aid from any power in Europe to carry on the war against us is very certain, and the probability is great that Spain will speedily join in the war with France against England. Yet such is the temper of the British Court that it seems clear to me that nothing but the severest gripes of adversity and the last necessity can inspire wisdom and moderation. They certainly mean another campaign, a last effort; and MARCH 15, 1779  Georgia and South Carolina, with the frontiers and sea coasts appear to be their objects at present. Whether Gen. Clinton will take the field or not must depend on the succors he shall receive and the strength of our army. The flattering royal visits that are industriously made to the Nobility and gentry of England may possibly give such energy to the militia as to enable the sending a small reenforcement from their national troops to Gen. Clinton. With our present prospects every nerve should be strained to make our Army strong. By being prepared we shall have a moral certainty of defeating the designs of our enemies the next campaign, which will in my opinion put a glorious period to the war.

Laurens since we came into Congress this morning, is so agreeable and MARCH 16, 1779  may be attended with such happy consequences that we have snatched a flying minute to communicate it to your excellency.(1) Sunday about 1 o'clock in the morning (February 14th) Col. Campbell having previously destroyed the flat bottomed boats in which he had intended to have crossed Savanna River into So Carolina, quietly retired from Fort Augusta leaving behind him all his sick & wounded with a polite note recommending them to the care of Brigr. Genl. Williamson who had prepared to attack the fort the next day.  Genl. Williamson immediately detached Cols. Mc.Intosh & Hammond to hang on the skirts of the fugitives these officers had already received many deserters. The express says the night he left Charlestown a message was received from Genl. Williamson informing that Col. McIntosh & Hammond had taken all the enemy's Baggage, killed & wounded many of their troops and that many more deserters had come in from them. Col. Laurens further tells us that Col. Campbell had invited the Indians to a treaty with him to no purpose, that Genl.

  Dr Sir, Philadelphia March 18th. 1779. We have not been favored with one line from you either public or private since our arrival in this City. (1) I suppose the exertions our State is making for the Southern Service fully occupies your time, and thoughts. I will therefore not complain of your silence, but I must beg leave to suggest to you that want of information relative to many objects-which must have been before the assembly leaves us in a situation very awkward & disagreeable. The recruiting the Continental Battalions, the Clothing the Troops and Officers, the supplying them with necessaries in such a manner as to prevent their suffering injuriously under the deprivation of the public currency, the efforts for supporting public credit, and supplying funds for reducing the paper currency, are subjects of the highest consequence, and which are, in Congress, objects of unremitting solicitude. On these the most material measures must be ultimately taken by the respective States, and Congress ought to be informed as early as possible of their several exertions. I need not suggest reasons for this to you, but I beg you to consider how disagreeable our situation must be when for want of information, we cannot give the reasonable satisfaction to Congress of saying what our State has or has not done.  Our fellow Citizens who are in the Military line, are daily applying to us to know what provisions are made for them? what attention their Country gives to their sufferings? are they the only Troops who are to be neglected by their more immediate Fellow Citizens for whose rights they are contending at the certain loss of time, of health, of domestic comforts, and the imminent perils of life, while other Troops are the objects of the most liberal and generous attention of the States for whose quota they have engaged. I for my own part, have no doubt that our Country is as generous as any other in the Union-and I hope has the same just sense of the attention due to Citizens so useful, and meritorious as those of the Military order, but uninformed as I am, I can give no satisfactory answer to questions so reasonable, so interesting and so pathetic, and believe me  MARCH 18, 1779  sir, I feel the most poignant concern when I am obliged to dismiss any of those brave and valuable men, without that satisfaction which they have so much just reason to expect. I beg of you Sir, to order the proper officers to transmit to us an account of what has been done by the Assembly on the above matters.  I can give you no news that is interesting. Unimportant Trifles are neither worth your time or mine, and I will not trouble you with them. Affairs of moment are indeed before Congress but not yet ripe for promulgation.

  Dear Sir Philada 20 March 1779 Congress have declined accepting your Resignation. (1) It woud be too great a Gratification to malevolence & too great a sacrifice of the Interest of the Publick & the Security of your own State. We are not yet out of the woods tho' we begin to see our Way. Men of publick Spirit & great Abilities cannot be spared The Operations of the War will lead where you have most Experience. But the Reason which ought to satisfy you is that the Commander in Chief expressed the Strongest Aversion to your MARCH 20, 1779  leaving the Service, giving you high Commendation & urging your Genius & your Experience & that he greatly relied on them.  I know your Infirmity of Body and am sorry for it: but it is not my Intention that your Health shoud be exposd to hardship it cannot sustain. Your advice when you cannot move and your general Superintance under the authority of your Command, will be of the highest Importance. Consider besides who may be your successor, & how much your State has to hope & to fear. Consider All these Circumstances & then tell me whether as a Man of Honour I coud see you driven out of the Army by illiberal Treatment; or as a Patriot submit to the Loss? The Delegates from New York were unanimous in their Resolution that they woud not Vote to accept your Resignation. As our State extends from Lake Nipissin to the Source of the Missisippi, or at least along the 45 d. of N. Latitude from Connecticut River to the Missisipi; how necessary will it be for us that your Military Knowledge shoud be kept alive & your Authority undiminished. I hope you will chearfully submit to what is done, & drop the Correspondence, at least with Congress, on this Subject. If more must be said let it pass thro' your Friends: and whenever you Resign let it be after the Impressions so cruelly attempted to be inculcated are effaced. At least let it not be said that you was obligd to give way to those who persecuted you without a Cause.  Congress have orderd the Articles for Onei[d]a & Tusc[aror]a presents to be sent as you request;(2) The Commiss[ion]s are to be reported upon by the Board of War & you will hear of them in good Time....(3)  The bolting Cloath cant be purchasd under £120 Pen. Cur. I have consulted Col. Livingston. We dare not submit to such an Act of d___ d Intention without your permission. It is of Light Carriage & can easily be forwarded. I presume at Kingston you can make a much better Bargain.

But lest the honorable Assembly should conceive that We are responsible for such Inconveniences, We beg Leave to inform them, that Congress have always entrusted their President with the Business of transmitting Such of their Proceedings to the several States as were necessary for their Information, & in Consequence thereof have allowed him a Secretary & Clerks at the publick Expence; And We think that our honorable Colleague who has filled the Chair will join with Us in Opinion, that as on the one Hand, It might have been deemed officious, in any Members to have taken the Charge of transmitting such Proceedings to their respective States, so on the other, the Secretary of Congress could not have been justified in permitting Extracts of the Journals to have been taken previous to his furnishing the president with Copies for the several States; neither could the Members of any State who had not relyed on the Care of the president, have expected that he would detain the Expresses for their Dispatches.  We fully agree with the honorable Assembly, that it is necessary that the Assemblies of the several united States should from Time to Time be made acquainted with what passes at Congress, in Order that Measures may be adopted seasonably, for carrying their resolutions into Execution; and We are more convinced of this from our own Experience of the Want of Information of what passes at the General Assembly, Whose salutary Plans, as far as they depended on Us, may have been frequently obstructed, from our not having received their Journals, or a regular Communication of their proceedings since the Beginning of the Year 1776.

6919,dg012246,1779,James Duane to George Clinton,"""James Duane to George Clinton
  Dear Sir, Philad. 21 st March, 1779. I flatter myself your Excellency will be pleased to hear that General Schuyler continues in the Army, Congress having refused to accept his resignation. In a general view, I look upon him as of high importance: but to our own state, his weight and services are most essential. The sufferings of our frontier inhabitants, the danger of their totally retiring into the interior country, the disposition of Congress to chastise and subdue the Six Nations for their perfidy, the views of the Commander in Chief to this great object, the share our State must take in the operations, and the vast benefits it must ultimately derive from their success, are considerations which must lead us to detain, in so principal a command, one of our immediate fellow citizens qualified, both from inclination and experience to do us all possible good. These remarks will carry double force, if it is considered who might be his successor, and how qualified and disposed. As a State we have vast objects to contemplate. Our Western boundary is either a line from Lake Nippissing to the River Mississippi; or at least a line in the Latitude of 45°, from Connecticut River at the station fixed there (by the Commissioners from Canada and New York in Sir Henry Moore's administration) through Moore's point, to the Mississippi: no State has a color of claim to this part of the country: and you have observed that by the confederation, the United States can set up none as a joint interest. Indeed in all our debates it is admitted that this territory appertains to our State exclusively. I told your Excellency that I was once drawn in to make it a very serious point! it is the last time it ever was disputed. Having such an immense field we must look forward in season. Virginia has already set us the example. She has actually taken possession of the French settlements on the Mississippi in the Illinois country, occupies Fort Chartres by a garrison, and 4000 inhabitants have submitted to their government and sworn allegiance. At least so Col. R. H. Lee informs me. This carries the views of our State directly to Detroit: but Oswego and Niagara are objects first to be obtained: all of them will be achieved, with God's blessing, by the efforts of the Continent. We are in time to consider how to retain them: for to us they must be surrendered. But your Excellency will ask me, how this great territory is to be held by a State which is not overcharged with inhabitants? I answer that all freemen will look to America for establishments, and that our State, if not inattentive to its own interest, will have the preference. It is esteemed for its Soil, navigation, and situation, which are natural advantages; for those of a political nature it is admired. All sensible people are loud in extolling the excel- MARCH 21, 1779  lency of its Constitution, the vigor of its government, the wisdom and fortitude of its inhabitants; and many talk of removing to it even from the settled States. We have nothing to do but to preserve our reputation, by a just, liberal, and wise police, and a vigilant attention to the public interest. These are general reflections: I shall endeavor to be more pointed. Britain settled a line of property with the Six Nations, the Almighty gave them a right of soil: by their own act they submitted their country (in the name of the king whose rights are devolved on our people,) to the protection of New York, then under a royal head. Every right acquired by those treaties and cessions are our own on principles of equity, for they were obtained by a long series of negotiations, presents, and acts of kindness and protection, derived from the blood and treasure of our ancestors both Dutch and English. To those Treaties on our part we have with very few exceptions strictly adhered. In modern times we have done it with the utmost fidelity. The exceptions in a national view were trivial, respecting a few acres, comparatively of territory, and some frauds in trade; and these arose from the avarice of individuals; and not from the acts of government. The Indians have not been so faithful to their engagements; much have we suffered and at various periods, by their wanton outrages. Their violation of the great treaty of Albany with the United States was perfidious beyond example; and their Subsequent ravages, while we were doing our utmost to clothe, protect, and leave them in peaceful security, barbarous and destructive. The Congress are resolved to call them to a severe account; and there seems to be no doubt but that, from the necessity and justice of the measure, our efforts will be crowned with success, and produce peace and submission. What are the conditions which justice demands from a people who last summer confessed that they had destroyed our habitations, and murdered our citizens without the least provocation, or any other inducements than Butler's presents? If they are suffered to remain on this side of Niagara, I mean the perfidious tribes, they at least must make a full compensations for all the injuries they have done to our State; not in words, but according to the South Carolina plan, by a large cession of territory. To demonstrate the equity of this proposition is needless: an estimate to enforce it of all the buildings they have burnt, and damages they have done.to the inhabitants, should be immediately taken. An account of the people they have slaughtered should be collected; a high penalty set upon every life: all the expenses the State has been put to, and the loss of Labor which has accrued, should be calculated. With those materials in a negociation we shall be able to procure satisfaction for the injured, and a great accession of the property of the soil, to the State. We shall be able if the aggressors are wholly driven from their possessions to justify ourselves to the world, and to our own posterity: we shall if they are suffered to stay on granting a compensation have a cogent argument to apply to their reason or complaints: and a powerful example to restrain their ferocity, and awe them to peace. They will know that hereafter they are to pay for their depredations and butcheries and they will be cautious  of incurring the debt. Indeed if we had nothing but our immediate safety in view this would be a most salutary measure. But how great will be the political advantages? We shall acquire a right of soil to encourage the settlement and the population of our country, increase our trade, and augment our Strength; and consequently our security, and national importance: and we shall be thereby enabled to provide for our soldiers who deserve our care, and to pay our taxes without distress. I do not mean that the proposed estimate should be made out with critical exactness: the members of the Assembly, with your Excellency's assistance, can place it on a sufficient ground for treaty.  I ask pardon for being so particular on a subject you so well understand: but as the policy and even necessity of the proposition makes a deep impression on my mind, I could not avoid enforcing it.  Congress have been under a necessity of leaving it to the States to fill up their quotas of the Army in their own way; Virginia having taken her measures without consulting us, and their Assembly being adjourned before the account reached this City. (1) She has been so excessively liberal as to grant 400 dollars and 300 acres to every volunteer who shall enlist in her battalions during the war. While States thus interfere no general system can be adopted; but each must be left to its own prudence. Our plan was to give a sufficient bounty and recommend it to the different Legislatures to refrain from partial bounties. I think it would have been wise. As we are still under a necessity of emitting money, the people being averse to loans, we are called upon from all quarters to recommend a large additional tax. No thing else can aid our currency. I wish to know the opinion of our State. We are seldom favored with their directions, and therefore have not so much confidence as the gent. who are more frequently instructed by the sense of their constituents.  I have the honor to be, with the utmost respect, Sir, your Excellency's most obedient, humble Servant, Jas. Duane.  ""

  Dear Sir Philadelphia 21 March 1779. So uncertain has been the Fate of Letters during the Course of this War, that I very seldom write one without adverting to the Possibility & Consequences of its Miscarriage and Publication. This Caution has on a late occasion given me much Consolation. Two of my Letters to Mrs. Jay fell into the Enemy's Hands at Elizabeth Town. They contained nothing that would give me Uneasiness if published. Prudential Considerations of this Kind, have since my arrival here restrained me from writing several confidential Letters to You; and I should now be equally cautious, had I not full Confidence in the Bearer, & under little Apprehension of Danger from accidents on the Road.  Congress has refused to accept your Resignation-twelve States were represented. (1) New England and Pennsylvania against you. The Delegates of the Latter are new Men, & not free from the Influence of the former- from New York South you have fast Friends. Mr. Laurens's Disposition indeed is at least questionable-Delaware was unrepresented.  What is now to be done? You best can answer this Question-were I in your Situation I should not hesitate a Moment to continue in the Service. I have the best Authority to assure you that the Commander in Chief wishes you to retain your Commission. The Propriety of your Resignation is now out of Question. Those Laws of Honor which might have required it are satisfied-are you certain they do not demand a contrary Conduct. You have Talents to render you conspicuous in the Field, and Address to conciliate the affections of those who may now wish you ill. Both these Circumstances are of worth to your Family & independent of public Considerations argue forceably for your joining the army. Gather Laurels for the Sake of your Country & your Children. You can leave them a sufficient Share of Property-leave them also the Reputation of being descended from an incontestibly great Man-A Man who uninfluenced by the Ingratitude of his Country was unremitted in his Exertions to promote her Happiness. You have hitherto been no Stranger to these Sentiments, & therefore I forbear to enlarge. Would it not do you Honor to inform Congress that while in their opinion your Services ought not to be withheld from your Country, neither the Derangement of your private affairs, the Severities you have experienced, or Regard to your Health already impaired in their Service, shall restrain you from devoting yourself to the Execution of their Commands. But that whenever the Situation of public Affairs may cease to call you to the Field, you hope they will permit you to retire and attend to the Duties you owe your Family. MARCH 21, 1779  Should this be your Determination, would not the main Army be your proper Object? There you may be best known & there best acquire military Influence. Consider-this campaign will in all human Probability be decisive and the last-Can you therefore employ six or Eight Months better?  I will not appologize for the freedom with which I write, being persuaded that altho our opinions may vary, you will consider this Letter as some Evidence of the Sincerity with which I am, Your Friend & Servt, John Jay.

  Sir, Philad. March 21, 1779 When it was first intimated to me, that Council intended to drag me into their dispute with Congress, I considered it as a groundless surmise. Because judging of others by what I felt in my own mind, I flattered myself, that as you were no stranger to the part I had acted and the pains I had taken to remove doubts respecting your conduct, to wipe off aspersions cast on your character and to obviate objections and remove prejudices against you occasioned by hasty and unguarded words & expressions dropped by you in the warmth of your zeal for the public service; that you in return, who were so intimately acquainted with my conduct and motives of action, for a series of years, would oppose any attempt to injure my MARCH 21, 1779  reputation: At least from your professions of friendship & regard for me, I thought it incredible, that such a measure could be seriously resolved on without your giving me some previous intimation of it. Besides it appeared to me altogether improbable and too injurious to the reputation of Council to suppose that words spoken in July 1778 (1) should lie rankling in their minds till March '79; more especially when I considered that a few weeks after the transaction, I had received a pressing invitation to meet the person offended who then held the first post in government & others of the highest rank, to form a club for purposes you are well acquainted with; that I attended one evening and received every mark not only of civility and respect, but of confidence & friendship; that at parting I received a cordial invitation to join the club and upon my mentioning how my evenings were engrossed by the duties of my office was told that the company sensible of this would not insist on a constant attendance, but that my occasional visits would be agreeable. It is true I did not attend again. But no offense could be taken as there was an obvious reason for my not attending & whatever private objections I had remained secret in my own bosom.  For the reasons above mentioned I thought it altogether improbable that my name should at this time be brought into your dispute. But, it seems, I was mistaken. A point is now to be carried, and to attain this, every bond of friendship is to be broken, every sentiment which would influence a generous mind is to be sacrificed. Nay, it is said that a person in high office and confidence of council has declared \""That they are determined to put every thing to the issue and either to sink Congress or sink themselves\"" or words to that effect. Can it be possible that such a resolution is taken and an avowal of it encouraged by those who are entrusted with the supreme executive power of Pensylvania? Yet the person making the declaration had a right to know, & must have been very deficient in his duty if it was longer to remain a secret. If this is really the case, it will be easy to account for what to me seemed so highly improbable. But the difficulty still occurs how to credit this which seems to surpass all belief. What must be the consequence if either event takes place? Have you, Sir, have Council provided for your safety so as to be guarded against the consequences? You are surely too wise and too prudent to put all to the hazard. The world will never believe you capable of such folly. Pride and passion are bad councillors; but cannot be supposed to influence the conduct of a prudent man. Suppose the worst that could happen to America, personal safety, nay riches and honors will be but a poor recompence for the loss of character and the curses of posterity. I pray you, Sir, to consider that in contests such as those in which we are engaged, Suspicion and jealousy are awake; that however patriotic and upright your designs are, they may be misconceived or misinterpreted. Already surmises are creeping in; and people are beginning to sound each others sentiments by shrugs and wishes that all may be right. Slander will soon begin to open her mouth. A people who wish to be free will ever be   jealous of those to whom they entrust power. They will fear their actions, examine their motives & judge of their conduct. The declaration of governor Johnstone in parliament, when he so cautiously & guardedly denied the accusation stated against him with regard to you \""that he did not mean to disavow his having had transactions where other means besides persuasion have been used\"" makes a deep impression on the minds of many. And a question is started. Suppose it were possible to conceive that a president and council of one of the united states were the persons with whom those other means have been used what would be the line of conduct they would probably pursue? Openly and avowedly to advocate the cause of great Britain would be folly in the extreme. What then would be their line of conduct? Would it not be to divide the people by every means in their power; To lessen the reputation & consequently the weight & authority of the great council of the United States; to poison the minds of the people & prejudice them against Congress by misrepresentation of facts & publications calculated to deceive; to seize every occasion of quarreling with Congress, and endeavour to bring the other states & particularly the legislature of their own into the dispute; To labour to damn the reputation of the commander in chief, if this cannot be effected to fawn, flatter & cajole by addresses & fulsome adulation; To attack & endeavour to ruin other general officers of the Army not sparing those of their own state whom they cannot hope to influence, especially such as are distinguished for their spirit and bravery; and if they cannot effect their purpose to disparage their past services, pour upon them a torrent of abuse with a gently salvo of \""as it is reported and believed\""; And to foment differences between them & the officers of their own state; to bribe the soldiers & alienate the inhabitants of their own state from the service by representing military discipline as degrading to freemen; To keep hackney writers in pay for the purpose of amusing the people and drawing their attention to other objects than those of their safety; To leave the defences of their country unguarded & unrepaired, that the enemy may meet with no opposition, in case they think proper to attack or invade it, &c.  But I fear I am trespassing on your time & patience. Though this letter is drawn from me by a proceeding I little expected, and is written with freedom; yet I can assure you it is not dictated by passion but with a sincere desire that you may profit thereby. I have no other end in view but the happiness & prosperity of my country, to the service of which I have devoted myself, in a line that cannot interfere with you, nor with any other person that I know, for whom I ever professed a friendship.  May you wear your laurels ever blooming, and deserve the applause of the present as well as of succeeding ages is the wish of him who was your sincere friend & who is still with all due respect, yrs.

  My Dear Bror. Philadelphia 22d March 1779 On the 16th instant I hastily acknowledged the receipt of Yours of the 9th Ulto which had just then come to hand, intending at that time to take a more leasure moment to consider its contents. You give me a Friendly caution against engaging in any party matters, as such I take it. I believe you will do me the justice to allow that my Public conduct is not influenced by Personal attachments. From the commencement of the present dispute with Great Britain (with which commenced my attendence on public Business) I think I have made Truth, Justice, & the Public Weal, the only objects of my attention, & this principle only shall influence my conduct with respect to Mr. D___(1). As to Mr. p, (2) he is perfectly indifferent to me, I have not changed a word with since my arrival here in Nov. last, nor do I mean at any rate to be an advocate for him; in his controversy with D he has shewn much temper & a great want of Prudence, but is in no instance (that I can recollect) chargeable with a deviation from Truth, he has full evidence of what he asserts as facts & violent presumtive evidence of every insinuated Charge. I will mention one instance which at present occurs to me and which perhaps appears as incredible to you as any of Mr. Pains insinuations. I mean the robing the Mail of Octo 1777(3). It must appear to a stranger (who has only heard of Mr. D s being employed in a public carecter of great trust) that nothing but Malice could dictate a Suggestion that he could be capable of such a peice of baseness and yet there are such circumstances attending this matter that whoever are acquainted with them cannot entertain a doubt of the fact. This mail was delivered to Congress by a Mr. Folger, on opening it blank papers were found in the several packets which originally contained the public dispatches & Letters from Mr. Lee & some other of the Commissioners, but the private Letters from Mr D to his Friends were safe, this Circumstance alone is sufficient to raise a suspicion, there are others which prudence forbids my committing to paper at present but which so strongly coroborates what I have already mentioned as to carry full conviction to every impartial mind, now, if we can suppose a man capable of such an act, what dark deeds can we suppose him incapable of? By this time I immagine you have formed some Idea of this mans Charec- MARCH 22, 1779  ter, but I will relate one circumstance more, & then recommend a second reading of Pain's publications, you will then be able to form a true judgment. Mr. D has had the Command of very large sums of public money; large sums have passed through his hand unconnected with his Colleagues; has he settled his accots? C.S. tells you he has not & C.S. tells you the truth indeed Mr D tells the free & virtuous Citizens of America that he has lodged their papers in a place of Safety but why did he not bring them with him? A Stronger Convoy than 12 sail of the line is not to be expected or if he suposed the risque too great notwithstanding this force, surely he might have brot copies with him. He has often been questioned on this subject but I have never heard of his giving a satisfactory answer. When Mr D was before Congress & a proposition was made to ask him questions he desired no questions might be asked, that might tend to Criminate him. He was not Charged with any crime, but was called before Congress to give an account of forreign affairs in general what could he have to fear? (being inocent) from any questions that could be put to him; the very proposition in my judgment implies guilt. When this Gentn went to Europe he was known to be possessed of but a very small fortune, soon after his arrival in France he engaged in business to an extent that required a very large Capital; large sums of public money in his hands unaccounted for to this day; what must be the conclusion? He had art enough to get on the blind side of a man of 76 but was not able to evade the watchfulness of his other Colleague, who was therefore burdensome to him. I have said much more on this subject than I intended to, but it is necessary for me to obviate one difficulty that you seem to labor under which arrises from D's vile insinuation that Congress would not hear him, I must confess I was amaized at his intolerable impudence, but more surprised that it shod be passed over in the manner it was; however this is one of those matters that prudence forbids my trusting in a letter therefore must be contented with assuring you that the insinuation has not the least foundation in truth.  It may not be improper to mention one Character who is a principal object of D's Calumny. I mean A.L.(4) There is no one that deserves better of America than this Gentn, to him we are indebted for all the useful intelligence for many Years before the commencement of Hostilities & to him we are indebted for great part of the Supplies that Mr D takes to himself the whole credit of, for he had formed the plan long before Mr. D left America but his integrity stood in Mr D's way, & therefore endeavours are made to raise suspicions of him in the Court of France, how far he succeeded in this Treacherous design I am not able to say, but I imagine not to his wish. Inclosed you have an extract of a Letter from a Gentn whose varacity is unquestionable and on whose opinion you may rely. By this time I believe you are as tired of Mr D as I am, & that is saying a great deal too, for I assure you I am sick of hearing him mentioned because I think it will be a great blot in the History of America that such a Charecter should be employed in a virtuous struggle for Liberty-but even such Charecter will find supporters, & the most Virtuous will be  traduced, such is the depravity of Human nature, but the approbation of a good Conscience is a ballance to every unjust aspersion, whoever preserves this need not fear all the shafts of Malice & envy.

No \""Bribe\"" shall prevail on me to desert my Country. I will still exert my poor Abilities in her Service. But as I am satisfied that there are others who are much more capable of serving her in this Department than I am, I may be allowd to say, that after near five years absense from my Family, and in a Climate unfriendly to my Health, I have Reason to expect I may be permitted to spend the Remainder of my Days in my native Place and enjoy the Pleasures of domestick Life. There, I shall on all Occasions contribute my Mite in promoting the Peace and Prosperity of my fellow Citizens. In their Service, I began my political Race. I have ever kept their Interest in View. It will never be in my Power to render them much more Service; but my best Wishes for them will be coequal with my Life.  I do not think my Countrymen are ungrateful; but I am affraid there is a Faction among them, consisting of a few Men, who are under the Dominion of those Passions which have been the Bane of Society in all Ages-Ambition and Avarice. I wish their Number may not increase. They are congenial Spirits with Hutchinson and those who aimd at grasping Wealth and Power. America, when she was wise, was jealous of such Designs. She opposd them though they were backd with the Wealth and Power of Great Britain. Such Kind of Men do me great Honor as they ever have done in being my Enemies. While such Men exist, and I believe they ever will in this World of Vanity, an honest Man would feel mortified indeed, to have it said that all Men spoke well of him. These Men hate, but I would not believe them if they were to say, they despisd the Man whose Integrity they cannot shake. They dread, but they cannot despise him of whom they entertain an Opinion, that he is a virtuous Citizen. I do  MARCH 23, 1779  not covet their Esteem.

  My dear Sir Philade. March 23. 1779 I am to acknowledge the Receipt of your Favors of the 12th & 28th of February. 1 The Letter you mention in the former came to hand, but I am apt to think it will have no Effect at all.(2) There was an Omission, in the Navy Boards not having Notice officially of the inclosd Resolution of Congress, but I hope the Delay has not been attended with material Inconvenience. (3)  I do sincerely hope the General Assembly will appoint another Person to take my Place here. I wrote a Letter to them last December, requesting that I might be relievd by one of my absent Colleagues or some other Gentleman, and permitted to return to my Family. I find my Health declining, and the Air of this Country is unfriendly to it. I am therefore for that, and other Reasons which I shall mention to you hereafter, steadfastly determind to get my self excused in April or May at farthest. In doing this, I shall immediately make Room for an abler Man. Such may easily be found and, I hope, be prevaild upon to come. I shall also gratify those whose Hearts are bent upon my Removal; and I shall save them Abundance of Pains which they will otherwise be put to, in making their Interest to effect it. These Men agree with me, if in Nothing else, in wishing most cordially for my Retirement from publick Life. Perhaps they would chuse to have me recalled with Disgrace. I hope that will not be in their Power; though I think I could bear even that with becoming Fortitude, for I am conscious that I do not deserve to be disgracd by my Country, and can be happy in the Reflections of my own Mind.  The Arts my Enemies make use of are contemptible. Last year, as you observe, I was an Enemy to General Washington. This was said to render me odious to the People. The Man who fabricated the Charge did not believe it himself. When he endeavord to make others believe it, he attempted to injure me by imposing upon them. His own Heart must therefore reproach him with complicated Acts of Injustice, and if he has any Feeling, he must despise himself. If I indulgd the Spirit of Revenge, could MARCH 23, 1779  I wish for more? Now, you tell me, their Art is to prejudice the People against the Lees, and to propagate that I am a Friend to them. How trifling is this! Am I accountable to the People for my Opinions of Men? If I have found, from long and intimate Acquaintance with those gentlemen that they are, and have been from the Begining of this Contest, among the most able and zealous Defenders of the Rights of America and Mankind, shall I not be their Friend? I will avow my Friendship to these gentlemen in the Face of the World.

  Dear Sir, Mar. 23d. 1779. You have lived long enough in the World to know that a Man may vex himself to death if he lets the little Arts of Envy or Malice affect him, therefore you will be thrown into no Convulsions upon reading the Remarks made upon Morris and Drayton by Common Sense who meanly gives into an Error of Servility while he corrects the Duumvirate. He was affraid to mention any Body but Starke.  A very judicious Foreigner who was at the Camp Celebration of the Alliance wished out of pure Regard to Genl.Washington that a Somebody in the Assembly could have mustered Magnanimity enough to fill a Glass to Genl. Gates when those who died at Saratoga were remembered.  I wish I was near you [to] talk over the Ultimata suited to the Time and supposed State of Things in which Peace may happen to be proposed. It would be no Miracle if now hinted. But I own I wish it may not be offered but at a Season when we are prepared for War or at least preparing. Is that our Case now?  As to northern Expeditions, I am not in the Secret.  Is it not imprudent to keep only about 6 Thousand Men & no Ships at N York? I do not say it is insufficient, considering all Things. MARCH 23, 1779  No Letters from Boston Today. No Man not even a Currier is thought to be obliged to behave as formerly when the Money was better. How shall we contrive to burn half of it? If Men will not lend we must emit. Why is there not so much Patriotism as to enable us to declare solemnly that we will not strike a single Bill more? But, that Topic adds a Sickness at my Stomach to the Pain in my Jaw and obliges me to close with a Repetition of much regard. James Lovell  ""

  My Dear General Philada. March 23d 1779. I had the satisfaction of receiving your Letter of the 15th (1) by Colo. Laurens and I would have answer'd it by Colo. Harrison but I had not the pleasure of seeing him (being from home when he call'd on me) till he was about to leave the City.  I am happy that my taking a seat again in Congress meets with your approbation; and shall be still more happy, if by my advice or assistance America shall be relievd from her present distresses; for in my opinion she has not, at any time, since the commencement of this War, been in so much danger as she is now, and principally from the state of our finances, which seem to me to be in strange confusion. What may be the result of the late determination of Congress for calling in the Emissions of April & May 77 & 78 I know not; but the present effect is very contrary from what was expected. Our immediate Country is almost thrown into convulsions by it. I fear it has given a deadly stab to the Credit of any Paper Money that may hereafter be issued by Congress. Let us however profit by experience and endeavor to apply a remedy to the sore, before it make the bone caries. I propose certainly to pay you a visit in the Spring, for believe me when I assure you that I am with the greatest regard & esteem, Your Obedt.

  My dear Sir Philada. March 24, 1779  The Bearer of this Letter being prevented setting off today by a Storm, I have had Time to transcribe the inclosd Extracts. (1) They were written to me in Confidence, as you will observe. I think I am warranted in communicating them to you, because I know the Writer has as much Confidence in your Prudence and Discretion as he has in mine, if not more; and I do not see how I can better use them for the Purpose he intended in sending them to me, than by sending them to you. Those Parts which are descriptive of the Weakness, or if you think more proper, of the reserved Caution of Age, you will judge it prudent to keep secret for the present. There are some of our Friends, who having been long habituated to admire the Wisdom of the Philosopher, cannot easily be perswaded to believe, that in the different Character of a Politician, he may be lyable to human Frailties at the Age of more than three Score and ten. Those Parts which may serve to set Dr Lee in his true Character of an honest and diligent Servant of the Publick, you will make Use of for that Purpose; for it is of equal Importance that the Fidelity of one and the Treachery of another in the Service of the Publick, should be made known. A Man of inflexible republican Virtue, cannot but incur both the Dread and Hatred of those, who are ambitious-desirous of making Fortunes-artful and enterprizing, especially if much of the publick Treasure has passed, unaccounted for through their Hands. Mr. Dean would have the World beleive that Dr Lee is a dishonest Man and a Traitor. The writer of these Extracts who has had full Opportunity of enquiring, says, \""He is a Man of Integrity and Honor.\"" \""A Worthy Character.\"" \""Invariably attached to the Cause of America.\"" I am inclind to think, that no honest and sensible Man who is acquainted with both, will hesitate to determine, on which of their opinions to rely, or which of them, in the present Instance, ought to be supposd the impartial Judge.

That as this measures may involve inconveniences peculiarly affecting the State of South Carolina your Committee are of Opinion that the Same Should be Submitted to the governing Powers of that State, and that if the said Powers Shall Judge it expedient to raise such a force the united States ought to defray the Expence thereof-upon a View of the foregoing Circumstances your Committee report.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia March 25. 1779 I cannot help complaining to your Excellency of the behaviour of some of the Delegates from our State, Which is not only disgracefull to the State, but in my humble Opinion treating me with the greatest unpoliteness. They take upon them, to leave Congress when they Please & without leave, by which the State in course is not Represented. Last Saturday Dr Wetherspoon, went home without ever saying one word to me on the Occasion,(1) and this day Coll. Freelinghuysen went a way in the same manner. (2)  No Man has the Service of this Country more at heart, than I have, but then I should choose to be treated in such manner as I think I have a right to, as a Gentlemen; And I am certain such treatment from my Coleagues can not be deem'd in that line. Therefore I request it as a favour, that I may not be treated in like manner in future, to make my stay hear so exceeding disagreeable.  I Received a Letter this Week from Honble. Mr. Scudder dated 13th Instt. he wrote me he expected to be hear in about 6 Weeks from that date.(3) When Dr. Scudder comes I hope Your Excellency will have no Objection to my Paying a Visit to my family for a short time. As I have engaged to serve the State for the time of my appointment, I undoubtedly shall do it, to the best of my Power and ability. However I hope the Honble Assembly will Pay some Regard to the increase of Pay for my Service as every kind of Expence has advanced in this City upwards of 50 Per Cent since my Appointment. It is with great Reluctance I am under the disagreeable necessity, to mention a circumstance of this kind, but my Private fortune has Sufferd so much, from the great Losses I have met with, as well as my long cruel Captivity, that I shall not be able to Support the extraordinary Expence long.  I am certain there is no Member in Congress does more Duty than I do. Every morning at the Commercial Committee, afterwards at Congress, and three stated Nights in a Week at the Marine Committee besides Occasional Committees, in short there has been very few nights this Winter that I have not been engaged in Business. And not to be able to live, in the manner I have ever been used to, without spending my Own Money, MARCH 25,1779  as well as time, is rather too unreasonable for the Public to desire of an Individual.  I was exceeding happy to hear you was from home, when the Enemy came to Pay you a Visit, As I am certain you are not one of those Gentlemen, who they have the greatest Regard for. I should imagine Princeton or Trenton would be a much more Eligeable Place for Your Residence than Elizabethtown.  Your being taken, besides the many disagreeable circumstances of being a Prisoner, would be of the utmost bad Consequence, As I know of no Person, in Our Posession that you could be Exchanged for, however this subject is too melancholy to dwell on.

We observe that you do not mention the Confederacy-possibly she may not have sailed when this gets to hand-and that the Boston may be ready to proceed with her to the southward which would be a great Security, should that be the case you will judge as you think best.

  My Dear Sir No 11 Philadelphia 28th March 1779  Some days ago I hastily acknowledged the receipt of Your favor of the 20th Ulto. (1) I am fully of Your opinion, & was at the time that the Good effects of calling in the two Emissions will be in a great Measure Marred by Exchanging them, but you know the best Political systems are often destroyed by one stroke of bad Policy.  I believe I sent you some time ago News papers containing the Laws you mention respecting the Estates of Refugees (as you call them). (You'll pardon the criticism, but I never liked the word as applid to those People nor can I like the Epithet used by the Massachusetts assembly viz Absentees. Those people have either fled from justice or deserted the Cause of their Country & therefore I think are more properly to be called Fugitives or by some other epithet more descriptive of their true Charecters.) You say you have not the vanity to think N.H. the fitest State to take the lead in this business; I will not pretend to say, who ought to take the lead, but every State should judge of their own circumstances, and pass such Laws as the scituation of their affairs require.  Great dangers may arrise from placing too great confidence in men who are not Heartily attached to the Independence of America. Such charecters shod be watched with the most jealous Eye, but there are another set of people that we are to apprehend great danger from; I mean those who entertain principles repugnant to Republicanism; such undoubtedly there are in every part of the World & it will be happy for N.H. if such charecters do not insinuate themselves into Your councils & by their baleful influence weaken the foundation of that noble fabric (which I suppose you are about to erect) & render it unworthy the acceptence of the Goddess to whom it ought to be dedicated. That Heaven may guard my Country against the influence of such false Patriots is the most fervent wish of Your very affecte Friend and Most Humle Sert. WW  29th. Your favor of the 27th Feby is just come to hand. The Report of the dispatches with proposals of peace &c is without the least foundation, this is only a Tory Tale calculated to put people off their guard & slaken their exertions in the insuing Campaign.(2) I believe I informed you in some of my former letters that the last accots from Europe Breathed nothing but War. Tho' I do not believe they would persue the plan were it not for the unhappy scituation of our Currency & the Flattering accots they have had of our dissentions, these circumstances have encouraged them to try another Campaign; but I hope notwithstanding the many difficulties we have to encouter we have still virtue enough left to withstand their utmost efforts. Indeed I have not a doubt but we shall succeed but still every exertion is necessary to recruit, & put the Army on a respectable footing.  Mr. Frost intends to leave me in about a fortnight. I wish to know who is to take [h]is place, also when I may expect to be releived. My anxiety, MARCH 28, 1779  for the determination of some important matters will induce me to tarry as long as my constitution will bear this Climate, but I do not think it possible for me to tarry longer than May.  The last accots from S. Carolina were favorable. A recommendation is gone thither for raising some regiments of Blacks,(3) this will I suppose lay a foundation for the emancipation of those poor wreches in that Country & I hope be the means of dispensing the Blessings of freedom to all the Human Race in America.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia March 29. 1779 I am honored with your favor of the l9th and thank you for it.(1) I always thought too well of your wisdom and justice to suppose you could be influenced by the most groundless, illdesigning, and improbable calumnies that were ever devised by wicked minds.(2) From the most intimate confidential correspondence, and from the best information, I have abundant reason to be satisfied that both my brothers in Europe are as firmly attached to the independance and happiness of America as any Men that breathe the vital air. I should detest them if I thought otherways, or had any reason to think of them than as I have above expressed. A strict adherence to duty, active services for their Country, and opposition to public peculation has drawn this calumny on them.  Mr. Ford being such a man as you describe,(3) and having with him authentic documents to prove that he had been confided in by one of these States might well impose upon Dr. Lee who was an utter stranger to any misconduct that he had been guilty of here. I will answer for it, that he wont remain an hour in his employment after the Doctor knows his character. I shall be greatly concerned indeed if we have been so unfortunate as to have lost the military Stores that you expected.(4) But since Dr. Lee does not mention any thing in his letters to me about having shipped them, and not having seen any mention of such capture in the N. York papers, I yet hope they may be safe. 'Tis true the number of privateers that avarice and enmity have equipped from N. York & Bermuda to cruise on our trade is very great indeed. I think by their list they amount to more than eighty. Some Frigates are ordered to clear our Coast of these Rovers, and I hope they will be successful. But this destination of our Frigates ought not to be made public. I wish with all my heart we had any important intelligence to communicate to you. I know of none, unless what I have before written, that we have very good reason to know that MARCH 29, 1779  our enemies have no prospect of aid of any kind from any European power to assist them in their war against us. Holland seems much disposed to us, at least Amsterdam is securely with us, and that is a powerful part of their Union. The King of the two Sicilies has opened his ports to us,(5) and the English themselves publish that Spain has notified to the Court of London that she will join France if the former does not acknowledge the Independence of America & make peace. But such is the destructive obstinacy and wickedness of our enemies, that they appear determined to try another Campaign, and therefore our efforts should be exerted to reenforce our Army with all possible dispatch. The malice of our foes must recoil upon their own heads, if we are but wise and take the necessary  precautions.  I am dear Sir yours with much affection and sincerity,  Richard Henry Lee.

  My Dear Sir, Philadelphia 29th March 1779 Your two favors of the 1st and 8th inst. came to hand this day: the contents have been answered in several of my former letters-I mean those parts that respect your want of supplies.  If you suspect that the backwardness of the supplies is in any degree chargeable to my inattention, I will venture to say you do me great injustice. Conscious that no part of my public conduct is, or ever has been influenced by Sinister views and being also conscious that my feeble powers have ever been exerted for the public weal, I say guarded by this impenetrable Shield, I feel not the points of any complaints that may be levelled personally at me. I am truly grieved at every cause of complaint, many of which would vanish if individuals would duly consider the many, very important matters that demand the attention of the governing (or rather the leading power) of this extensive country.  MARCH 30, 1779  I am very sorry you declined (or that it was out of your power) to comply with the requisition of this Navy Board; (1) my view in procuring the order was that you might be furnished with a supply of provisions for public service and that the inhabitants in case of necessity, might also derive some benefit from the accession.  The situation of the paper medium is a matter of very serious concern: there is no one, but views it in that light and are sensible of the necessity of a remedy for the evils: but the great difficulty is to persuade a sufficient number of men to think alike on the subject-this I trust may some time or other be got over and I still feast on hopes that in due time we shall Surmount every difficulty. Nothing would contribute more to this desirable event than a restoration of public virtue to the State it displayed five years ago: but as that is hardly to be expected, we must go on and combat the frailties of mankind and every incidental evil till Nature in her due course produces such a convulsion as will effect a cure beyond the reach of human wisdom.  I congratulate you on the addition to your family-what a son! Ha! Well! I suppose there is no looking on you now without a smoked glass- be that as it may, please to give my kind regards to the lady within the curtain and tell her I wish her as much of that kind of work as she desires and that all her labors may be productive of real happiness. Please to assure her that these wishes proceed from the most sincere esteem and regard of her as well as, Your affectionate friend, & most hble servt,  Wm. Whipple.  ""

  Dear Sir Philadelphia March 30th. 1779. I received your letter of the 28th February last with Genl. Prescott's certificate. I am satisfied, from the wording of it, that neither Crossing nor Corey were, properly speaking, commissioned-officers of the Crown of Great-Britain at the time they were employed in the maroding, kidnapping Business for which they have been sentenced to die by the judgrnent of a Court martial. (1) The Question with me is not what kind of powers those powers were, which they received, and were lodged in the possession of Genl. Prescot; nor why they were so lodged; nor how they have been always consider'd. The plain Question is whether they are commissioned Officers of the Crown of Great Britain in the same sense and to every intent purpose as other British Captains & Lieuts are? As I have already said I am satisfied they are not. I imagin their future commissions depended upon circumstances which had not taken place at the time they undertook their expedition. I do not mean to argue on this subject. They have escaped, and I imagin will neither be retaken or returned. Suppose the Sentence of the Court martial should be confirmed! Do you think General Prescott will deliver them up to be executed? I should think not. If they have got to the Island they will abide there, at least until the determination of Congress shall be known; and when this will be I know not, for great & important matters are now on the tapis.  I read that part of your former letter which respected money matters to some of the members of the Treasury board, who told me that not long before a considerable Sum had been transmitted to the Paymaster.(2) I made out an extract from the letter I am now answering and deliver'd it to the Treasury board, which produced Money sufficient I hope to answer the present exigencies of the detachment, two or three days before the arrival of the Paymaster. I believe it would be well hereafter that He should write to the Treasury board, at the same time you write to them and point out the Sum wanted and for what purposes. I shall always with great cheerfulness execute your requests.  You forgot, Sir, to make the inquiry after Francis Brindley I desired you to make;(3) or, if made, to communicate the result of it. I have since been informed by the Chaplain to Glover's Brigade that he was married to the Widow Lawton, who acts as a Matron to the Hospital, by Mr. President Manning. If this should be true I would be much obliged to you if you would procure a certificate thereof and transmit it to me, that I may hand it to Brindley's wife who is a worthy woman.  MARCH 30, 1779  Please to inform me what number of troops there are on Rhode Island & what Number of ships there are in the harbour of Newport. It is reported here that Adml. Gambier is gone from New York with his heavy Ships to Newport. It is also reported that Count De Estaing had received a reinforcement of Six Ships of the line and had sailed to attack St. Lucia. What think you, Sir, of another attack on Rhode-Island? Americans can make three hits I believe as well as Britons can stand them. A brilliant stroke this campaign might produce an honorable peace. I wish you could make it; for I wish you all the honour that can be acquired by a gallant officer, being with the highest Sentiments of esteem,  Dr Sir, Yr most obedt. Servant, William Ellery  ""

  Honourable gentlemen Philadelphia 31st March 1779. We were duly honourd with your Joint favour of the 13th Instant,(1) and shall not fail to communicate to Congress, A measure, which in the Midst of your Distresses, gives an additional Proof of the Vigilance and Fortitude for which our State is so honourably distinguished among her Confederates. (2)  His Excellency our Governour is already apprized that the Conduct of the ensuing Campaign is in a great Degree submitted to the Commander in Chief; and that one of it's principal objects is the Defense of the Frontiers by the Chastisement of the Indians.  We apprehend that by a draft from our militia you have anticipated the general's Requisition; taking it for granted that he will stand in Need of an Aid of militia, as well from Us, as New Jersey and Pennsylvania; to cooperate with the Continental Troops, and give Efficacy to the Enterprize.  The Indians are cruel and wanton Aggressors in this War. To our State, which so long has cherished and supported them, they have done wide and extensive Injury. We have a Just Right to Reparation, and Security for their good Behaviour. The Example of the Southern States in compelling their Savage neighbours to make Cessions of Territory in Compensation for The Lives and Property they had destroyed appears to be worthy of Imitation. Whether it will be wise, on a Pacification, to suffer the revolted Tribes to reside to the Eastward of Niagara we do not decide: but if they should be treated with so much Lenity they ought at least to relinguish the Right of Soil in a large District to our State for the Use of the Individuals they have injured, & the Soldiers entitled to bounty Lands; and as an Equivalent to the Publick for all the Losses they have sustained in the Lives, Labour, and Property of their Citizens as well as their Actual Expences. It woud not be difficult to have a general Estimate formed of the Amount of those damages before the rising of the Legislature that it might be ready to be made Use of in a pacification, if our Efforts shoud be blessed with Success. We consider a Line in the 45th d. of northern Latitude thro' Morres point from Connecticut River to the Mississippi, to be our northern boundary, in the most limited View-A Boundary which, on a successful Issue of the War, must ultimately be MARCH 31, 1779  fixed for our State; Canada being confined to its ancient Limits, no other State having a Claim of Jurisdiction to this Territory, and no Common Right, or Joint Interest, for the united States being permitted by the Confederation.  From the great Extent of our Jurisdiction it follows that we ought to direct our earliest Attention to the Cultivation of the Country towards Oswego and Niagara, and for this Purpose to acquire the Right of Soil as soon as it can be done on Principles of Justice. By the Possession of D'Etroit And Niagara we shall again acquire our valuable Fur trade in the fullest Extent: But those important Possessions must be held on a precarious and expensive Tenure while the intermediate Country remains a Waste Desart.  We cannot refrain from adding that in our Opinion little else will be wanting for the rapid Settlement of this fertile Territory than a Wise and liberal System for distributing the publick Lands. It is with equal Truth and Pleasure, we assure you, that our Constitution is applauded, and the Vigour of our Government, and the Steadiness & Fortitude of our People, amidst an uncommon Share of the publick Calamities, admired; and that many have expressed their Intentions to become our Fellow Citizens, and partake our political and commercial Advantages when the War shall Cease.  The Legislature of Pensylvania have thought fit to grant the Officers of their Quota of Contl Troops half pay for Life. This Circumstance alone will probably introduce the Question of the Propriety of such a Provision for All the Officers in our Army; And we shoud wish you woud feel the Pulse of our Legislature that in forming our Judgement on this Subject we may not be altogether unassisted by those it most materially concerns.  We have the Honour to be-with the utmost Respect-Honourable Gentlemen, Your most Obedient, humble Servants  ""

  Sir. (No. 2.) (1) [April 2, 1779](2) Altho the Congress a few days ago have passed several Resolutions stating the situation of South Carolina & Georgia to be such, that they are  APRIL 2, 1779  incapable of any adequate efforts for their own defense, & recommending to Virginia & North Carolina to make every further possible effort to raise forces for their assistance,(3) & altho, it appears exceedingly clear, that no succors can be Sent to them from the Main Army, or any other state, & altho' we have been since the beginning of the War, very much harrassed with efforts for our Southern Neighbors, under an Idea that they were internally too weak for their own defense, yet Sir, a late Vote in Congress has inclined us to believe, that our Country has been very much mistaken.  Mr. Laurens who from his long experience & intimate knowledge of South Carolina, for which he is a Delegate, must have the clearest & most adequate Ideas of her strength & resources, has not scrupled to vote, that no Peace shall be made with Great Britain even should our Independence be secured in the most unlimitted manner, unless the latter will acknowledge to the United States the right of fishing everywhere on the Banks & Coasts of North America, where France has no right, in as extensive a manner as when connected with the British Empire, altho' this includes not only all the Banks & Coasts of the United States, but also, all that extend from the limits of these States, as far as Britain has dominions or claims. He has voted also, that, even if our Allies should not be in a condition to assist us, in carrying on the War, yet we shall not make Peace without the above concession. Under the Ideas we always had, & which the Delegates from that State so very lately taught us to entertain of her weakness, we cannot account for such a vote. To prolong the War in which his Country if defenceless, as she has been represented, must be exposed to constant ravages and horrors, appears to us inconsistent with good sense or humanity. We therefore conclude that his Country is strong & powerful in resources, which are unknown to us, & that confident of this, he defies all those difficulties which arise from our decayed & almost anihilated Finances, our ruined Commerce, our want of manufactures, our obstructed agriculture, our wasted forces, & our slaughtered fellow Citizens, from our want of resources of Men, Arms, ammunition, provisions or equipments, difficulties which appear to us almost ready to overwhelm our exhausted Country.  Deeply regretting the many Evils to which our own particular State is exposed by her frequent efforts, for the defence of her southern Neighbors, & by no means willing to continue or increase them by new efforts, which may not be absolutely necessary, & persuaded from the above Vote of Mr. Laurens that the strength & resources of So Carolina must be equal to exertions necessary for carrying on the War, independent of our Ally, even for objects not immediately necessary to the whole, & but remotely if at all interesting to her; under the pressure of all these considerations we venture to suggest to you Sir, that any further exertions of our State may be very well dispensed with.  It is well known to you, Sir, as well as to us that our State is in no condition to make unnecessary exertions, that she is not able to carry on the War for objects which are not absolutely necessary, that her exertions   for what are essentially necessary, have already exhausted & distressed her exceedingly.  We hope that you will concur with us in opinion that our Militia may return home as soon as may be, & that no more Battalions should be raised in our State for the purpose of being sent thither.  We were not surprized on this occasion to see the New England States vote for the proposition above mentioned. The object is to them peculiarly important, their Country from its situation & strength is secured in a great measure from the danger of ravages to which the Southern States from contrary circumstances are exposed, and nothing but a conviction of our being unable to carry on the War without the assistance of our Allies, who by their engagements are not bound to assist us in obtaining it, could induce us to decline it. But we were much surprized to see Pennsylvania & Delaware Vote for it, who of all the States are most injured by the War, & are as little as any Interested in Fisheries, the Improved state of Agriculture & the more flourishing circumstances of those States have made them the objects more immediately of military operations. Their commerce, which in Peace is exceedingly flourishing is entirely ruined by the War, their Husbandmen are harrassed with military services, their agriculture much decayed & their frontiers wasted or deserted. The necessaries of life at the most enormous prices, & a considerable part of their Country desolate & in ruins, yet those States thus circumstanced vote for the continuing the War, without Men, Money, Arms, clothing or Provisions! This must be infatuation or something worse. Tis time, Sir, for every State not thus extravagant to reserve her exertions, for her own particular defence.  We thought it our duty to give Your Excellency the above information, relying on your good sense that you will make such a use of this Letter as its importance deserve.(4) We have the honor to be with the greatest Respect, Your Excellency's Most obedt. humble Servts.

  Gentlemen [April 2, 1779](1) Considering that your State is always deemed so feeble in Internal strength and resources, that her defence when attacked must chiefly be performed by the Neighbouring States, and must fall more Immediately on North Carolina from her circumstances, and contiguous Situation.  Considering also that a Question now before Congress Involves the continuance of Hostilities, even tho' our Liberty, Sovereignty and Independence, absolute and unlimitted, as well in matters of Government as Commerce shall be acknowledged and secured, unless Great Britain will acknowledge a right of Fishing on all Banks and Coasts of No. America which were exclusively reserved to Britain by the Treaties of Utrecht and Paris, as fully as the Inhabitants of the Countries now composing the United States of North America injoyed when Subject to Great Britain; a right which we deem more Extensive than can with Justice be insisted on, and which our Allies by their engagements are not bound to assist us in Contending for, and which the Minister Plenipotentiary of France assures us his Court can not agree to continue the war for.  Considering also that in a late vote upon the Question alluded to, Mr. Laurens one of the Delegates from your State gave his voice for continuing Hostilities for the aforesaid object, even tho' our Allies should not be in a Condition to assist us from which we Infer, that he relies on a degree of Strength and resources in your State which is unknown to us, or on a mistaken Idea of the strength and resources of North Carolina. This long experience, and intimate knowledge of his own Country induce us readily to admit the former as the ground of his opinion. But we esteem it our Duty to inform you that in case of the continuance of the War for the aforesd. object North Carolina is not in a Condition to make any exertions for the Defence of So. Carolina, nor do we believe she will be inclined to make any.  We beg you to consider that in the event of the Continuance of the war your Country will probably experience all the calamities which can be apprehended from an Insolent, Relentless, Iritated, and Rapacious enemy, from your own Slaves armed against their former Masters, from the Savages excited to more bloody and merciless dispositions and conducted by leaders who have Inclination and Abilties to make their force and ferocity as effectual against you as possible.  Upon general matters we would not presume to lay our thoughts thus before you; how inadequate the resources of the Continent are to a continuance of war without allies, & what must most probably be the event April 2, 1779  Portrait of  John Penn APRIL 3, 1779  we suggest not to you, your participation in the publick Councils make it unnecessary and improper; but upon a matter so supremely Interesting and which so peculiarly affects the lives and properties of the States which you & we have the honor to represent, in which may be involved Desolation To our Countries and the most unbounded Ravages and carnage to their Inhabitants of all ages and sexes, and which may fall with peculiar weight and Injury on the State we represent, upon such a matter we cannot dispence with offering you this official memorial, and we hope you will consider our Expostulation as flowing from the anxious Concern we feel for our Country and that it will have with you its due weight.

  Dear General. Philada. 3d April 1779 Several Weeks have passed since I designed the pleasure of writing you, waiting from day to day, in hopes of aproaching a little nearer some Short System of communicable Politicks, as well as of the intended dispossition of the Army; but must at last content mySelf with a little cruder imperfect detail.  Of the late communications from the French Minister to our House, however some circumstantial matters we cannot devulge must remain out of sight, the Substance I think you have aright to know Viz. In the mediation of Spain betwixt the Courts of France & England The Independance of America is by the Court of France made a preliminary, which if not acceded to by Britain, the Spanish Minister has intimated that his Court will not See that of France involved in War without assisting her; (1) hence arises a probability of Peace, inform'd as we also are that Britain has applyed to the Empress of Russia for Troops & repeated that application with proposals as flattering to Russia as they are degrading to Britain, with repeated refusal on the part of Russia. We Expect a Loan in hard money either from Spain or Holland, the City of Amsterdam being much APRIL 3, 1779  in our favour. The King of the two Cicilies has Opened his Ports to America. France is Called to Mediate betwixt the Emperor & his Prussian Majesty, but insists that Spain be also taken into that mediation.  Thus we may Shortly have Some matters of importance to tra[nsact] with Spain as we have heretofore had with France and perhaps wth England which require certain preparatives on the part of Congress, and greatly enlarges the Circle of business under the Epithet of Foreign affairs.  The great depreciation of Our Money is truly allarming, a Subject [which] must again be immediately taken up. That of the Army has also long called for farther consideration. These three topicks require equal dispatch, yet have their constant interruptions not only from the daily dispatches on One branch or another of the publick busines, but also from the Spurious Sources of Pride, Ambition & intrigue for One purpose or another, whereby annimossitys, divisions & destruction of time must ensue-So that compared to Congress in its present attitude, I call the Army a Bed of ease, a Pillow of Down. General Arnolds affairs with the Civil powers of this State, has lost much of the Publick time, when half a dozen of polite or wise words, or Short plain & candid answer to the Supreme Council (authorized by Congress as they were to ask the questions) wou'd have prevented the whole at first. This disagreeable matter tending to interrupt the necessary harmony betwixt Congress & this important State is I trust chiefly Settled by means of a free conference requested by the Assembly & held betwixt a Committee of Congress & one formed out the assembly & Council of the State, in which for the publicks Sake, the Council generously gave up what they had considered as an insult agst. them, Some Other matters are refered to a Court Martial to be appointed by the Commander in Chief .(2) Mr. Dean is now Urging a final determination on his affairs, which I apprehend will prove vexatious. Common Sense if permitted has lately challenged him (Dean) to the Bar of Congress & that the doors be Open.(3) Open doors will not be allowed, yet perhaps both may be had. Poor Pane, not the most prudent man in the world, is excereted by a number & much out of the books of Congress, yet has most certainly brought various things neither reputable nor Salutary in our affairs, at least to a probable point of view, which otherwise wou'd have remain'd dormant. We must also have a Sudden Struggle on the point of Sending new Commissioners to Europe. Some are for recalling the whole that are there, others not-nor is it improbable that some may wish to be Sent from hence, who will not have the general Sufferage of the House. Congress have passed a resolve to raise & emansipate three thousand Negroes in S. Carolina & Georgia, pay, feed & Cloath them during the War. The proprietors to have from Congress 1000 dollars for each Negroe-Also to raise more troops in N. Carolina & Virginia for the Southern aid, a Regiment of Horse. I presume Blands or Bailors will also be Sent & if in Service will soon be melted down. The affair of the blacks is optional and Submitted to the Govt. of S. Carolina, it was moved by their own delegates. Young Coll Laurens is appointed the first Lt. Coll of   the blacks which I consider as a noble proposal in that Young Gentleman. You have Seen the generous lead taken by the Assembly of Pennsa. in allowing aid in Cloathing &c and half pay during life to the Officers of their line. I wished this measure to have taken its rise in Congress, but that Body have lost the honr. of it, yet must every State in my Opinion now come into it. Two Excursions, or Expeditions If you will, I believe are intended, Northward & Westward, but the particular Objects &c are yet Secrets to me, the General being gone out of Town before I arrived. The Seneca Indians &c & perhaps Niagarra I fancy to the North, and Detroit to the West (4)-this last I predicted against last year, nor are my eyes much clearer yet. I don't think the Object adequate at present to the certain expence &c. Poor McIntosh Sits in an humble chair. His Officers & the Militia of two States agst. him, near two thousand Horses dead, and The march but well begun, where are the Horses & Forage now, or what sums wou'd procure them? (5) Yet must the Indians particularly the Northern be Chastised else the back Countrys are undone. Nothing from you has yet appeared in Congress, if anything hereafter Shou'd, convinced as I am you will ask nothing incongrous to reason & the publick good, I shall with pleasure contribute to your wishes-the present I consider as an unfavourable moment to ask anything that can be Omitted. We are deluged in business & other impediments, which at present require a friendly & political Vail. All the members even of your State, do not put up their Horses in the same Stable. I have yielded to my Sons wishes in Staying with you another Campaign,(6) fearing only the State of his Health, and the beginings of an Obstructed Liver, Symptoms whereof Several Gent. have thought he had, he is reluctant to preventative medicine, which error I wish he cou'd amend least it shou'd prove fatal.

  Sir, Philadelphia 4th April 1779. The Honorable the Delegates of North Carolina now in Congress, have shewn me a Letter intended by them to be addressed to Your Excellency, (1) in which they display very freely & as I apprehend very unjustifiably an Instance of my conduct in that Assembly. \""I will hear the other party\"" has ever been a governing principle in my mind. No Man more convinced of the truth of this assertion in my own favor, than the Honorable Mr. Burke, Your Excellency will believe it too when you recur to my Letter of the 27th April 1778.(2) I am persuaded Sir, that I shall not find Your Excellency less impartial.  Were I in the present moment to attempt a vindication of that part of my conduct which has given the Gentlemen offence, I should Copy the bad example set by the Honorable subscribers of the Letter alluded to; I should join in the disclosure of a momentous subject now under deliberation, which I have pledged my faith & honor to keep secret.  APRIL 4, 1779  But admitting, as the Gentlemen allege, that I am in error, admitting that my supposed mal-conduct arises from \""Infatuation or something worse\"" does it follow that one State in our Union should be devoted to carnage, & the Interests of the other twelve essentially injured because South Carolina is so unhappy as to have one of her Delegates wrongheaded or foul hearted? Can we discover no medium? To speak a little freely Sir, in my turn, these Gentlemen of North Carolina appear to be under the government of Passion, I will not say anything worse. Are Men to be driven into measures by sophistry, misrepresentation & menaces? Could I have expected such attempts from Gentlemen whose daily & laudable boasts are,  \""I am accountable to my own State & will be governed by my own Judgement.\""  \""Fiat Justitia ruat Coelum.\""(3)  \""I have my own feelings & I am not answerable to any Man or set of Men but to my Self & my Constituents.\"" &c &c &c &c &c.  One moments reflection Sir, I am persuaded will determine your Excellency's \""good sense\"" to make \""such an use of the Gentlemen's Letter as the importance of it deserves.\""  Were I to presume to give an additional hint, it would be to keep in Your Excellency's own breast a secret which the Gentlemen have obtrusively & unnecessarily thrust into it.  It is possible I may have erred in judgement, the Gentlemen in their attempt to correct the supposed error, have committed Acts, which appear to me in the glare of heinos Crimes. They have attacked the freedom of debate & suffrage. They have menaced a free Citizen in order to bias his Vote. They have advised the abandonment of an Innocent people to the rage of a powerful & merciless Enemy. They have recommended measures which if adopted will endanger the safety of the United States. And have they not sacrificed their sacred faith & honor to pique & resentment?  But Sir, I will disclose to Your Excellency a secret which I never promised to keep, It is a settled Plan & has been for some time past \""to hunt me down.\"" Were there any just cause, unjustifiable means for accomplishing the pious purpose, would not be resorted to.  The, \""'vantage ground of truth\"" says Lord Bacon, \""is an incomparable pleasure, 'tis an Hill not to be commanded & where the Air is always clear & serene\"" & beleive me Sir, I do consistently with truth add, that I have seen from thence particularly in late Instances, \""The Errors, and wanderings and Mists and TEMPESTS in the Vale below.\"" All this if my Address arrives alone will be a riddle; If the honorable Gentlemen shall think proper to send forward their Letter to Your Excellency, that will produce explication.

In the moment your Letter of this Morning was brought to my House I was going abroad, the moment of my return I sit down to make a proper acknowledgment of the receipt.  In my address of last Night I requested you would honor me with explicitude and candour in your answer. You are pleased to give a preference to illusion and ambiguity. You have declined giving an opinion, or holding a conference, which evinces that you not only \""vote\"" but act \""systematically,\"" here you have drawn a line between us-henceforward I will neither receive from you, nor trouble you with a Letter of controversy but I will never with hold my voice in confirmation of any motion of yours in Congress nor my utmost support to your Measures out of doors where we may be jointly concerned, which shall appear to be conducive to Public good.  You have on 'your own part ardently requested the Delegates of North Carolina not to send their Letter to their Governor\"" from an assurance that \""South Carolina absolutely stands in need of the sisterly aid\"" of her Northern Neighbour. These Gentlemen have expressed sentiments which seem to be diametrically opposite to your assurances, and they have made the conduct of the Delegates of South Carolina the sine qua non of their own.  Did the Measures adopted by the Gentlemen of North Carolina point, in your view, Sir, to no higher an object than aid to a sister State, which it is neither in their Power to direct or restrain? Were you less affected by an attempt of violence upon the suffrages of free Citizens as well as upon the honor of all these Independent States, than you were by groundless apprehensions of temporary evils to your own? Do you think Sir, that your ardent requests can lull the Resolutions of those Gentlemen or warp their inclinations from the pursuit of a duty which they hold indispensibly necessary? Did not you feel a little for the breach of plighted faith and honor to keep secret deliberations upon a point, the disclosure of which may dash our infant Independence against the Stones? Or did you think me blind? Think, speak, and act Sir as you shall judge most convenient. I shall persevere in acting in all respects with propriety towards you, with diligence and fidelity in the common Cause of America, and with the most inviolable attachment to that State whose particular Servant I am.

  Gentlemen, (No. 7) Chesnut Street 4th April 1779 On the 2nd Instant a Packet was brought from the President's House to mine, by one of His Excellency's Servants, containing your Official Memorial without date directed to the Delegates of South Carolina, and a Letter, also undated directed to Governor Caswell. (1)  After our adjournment Yesterday, and not earlier, I found leisure to take those Papers under consideration. I have attentively purused, and have Copies of them, and I have the honor of assuring you Gentlemen, their several contents have their \""due weight\"" with me.  I sent those excellent Performances last Evening to my honorable Colleague,(2) not merely for his information, because I knew he had, a foreknowledge of them, but in hopes of obtaining from him what I had a right to expect, an explicit and candid opinion on the propriety of the Measure in which you have committed your selves-but my honorable Colleage judged it most convenient to decline hazarding an opinion, or holding a conference on the subject-with me.  He has returned me the Official Memorial,(3) and promised to deliver the Governors' Letter to yourselves.  I have no inducements to offer which can possibly \""supercede the necessity\"" for sending forward the Letter, your own \""good sense\"" will probably supply the deficiency.  In return Gentlemen for your candor in shewing me your calculations, I shall present to you under this Cover a rough Copy of a Letter which I shall transmit to Governor Caswell tomorrow,(4) in order to anticipate the Poison by the antidote, unless your intermediate conduct shall render the Measure unnecessary.

7009,dg012336,1779,Henry Laurens to the North Carolina Delegates,"""Henry Laurens to the North Carolina Delegates
  Gentlemen, [April 4?1779](1) I have read your joint letter to the Delegates of South Carolina & its inclosure (2) with all the attention that they deserve, nor will you suppose I read them without such emotions as they are well calculated to produce.  I presume it will not be denied, that the interest of each state in the Union is essentially involved in the interest, safety, and prosperity of the whole. As little do I suppose it will be contested that the safety and security of the whole depends greatly upon Marine force, that this force cannot be obtained without Seamen, and that the North American fisheries furnish the United States their principal Nursery of Seamen. The importance of this object to maritime and commercial nations is so well understood, that it has been the fertile source of great contention between France and Britain, nations removed three thousand miles from these fisheries, and who besides their other numerous resources for Seamen, possess valuable fisheries near their own Coasts. How infinitely more important must this object be to these United States from its contiguity to their Shores, and from its being the capital source from whence we are to supply our future Navy. The acknowledgement of our Independency by Great Britain is one thing, and the secure possession of that independency is another. The former may result from the present distress of our Enemies and the accumulated force opposed to them. But the latter must be maintained by the proper strength of the United States.  If when Massachusetts Bay, Rhode Island, New York, Pennsylvania, and the Jersies were invaded by such force as threatened the ruin of these States, they had offered to treat with the common enemy, in terms injurious to the interests of our States, or to the Union, we should not have thought such local and selfish considerations however powerfully pressed, a sufficient justification for a perfidious desertion of the Union, by offering to withdraw their aid from an opposition to the Common foe. Having considered this important subject in all the lights my judgement could place it, I agreed with the proposition for stating it as an Ultimatum \""that the right of fishing on the Coasts and Banks of North America be reserved to the United States as fully as they enjoyed the same when subject to Great Britain, excepting always what shall have been excepted by the treaty of Paris between France and the United States-The whole to be explained by the Treaties of Utrecht and of Paris with Great Britain, and of Paris with the United States.\""  APRIL 4, 1779  I have yet heard no reason to change my opinion and I hope gentlemen you will not imagine that a Mind resting on the strong ground of reason and public utility can be shaken by arguments in terrorem however highly colored.  But I will proceed to consider such parts of your letter as you seem principally to rely on for justifying what I cannot avoid esteeming a very strange and unusual proceedure. I call it strange and unusual for the Delegates of one State to attempt depriving those of another of their free right of voting in Congress by arguments drawn from threats of yielding their Country a prey to the enemy if they shall differ in opinion upon questions of great and general concern. You have thought proper to write the Delegates of S.C. that the questions above stated and on which I voted in the affirmative involves \""a right which we deem more extensive than can with justice be insisted on, and which our Allies by their engagements are not bound to assist us in contending for, and which the Minister Plenipotentiary of France assures us his Court cannot agree to continue the war for.\"" The first of this paragraph is matter of opinion on your part, which a Majority in Congress have already determined against, and the latter part of the same paragraph I will take leave to contrast with the following authentic documents.  1st. The 8th article of the Treaty of Alliance.  \""Neither of the two parties shall conclude either Truce or Peace with Great Britain, without the formal consent of the other f irst obtained, and they mutually engage not to lay down their arms, until the Independence of the United States shall have been formally or tacitly assured, by the treaties that shall terminate the war.\""  2dly. The sense of Congress on this subject expressed in their resolution of Jany. 14. 1779. (3)  Whereas &c &c.  3dly. The written official declaration of the Minister Plenipotentiary of France to Congress on the 9th of February last. \""The King my Master on his part, is invariably determnined not to seperate his interest from those of America and to support the cause of the United States as his own.\""(4)  When therefore, the most public and the most authentic records oppose themselves to your reasons, the world, and our Constituents will judge between us, whenever you incline Gentlemen to make the appeal.  As a Member of Congress, am I to found my opinion upon the open official declarations of the Minister to Congress, or disregarding these, to rest upon the opinions of particular gentlemen drawn from private conversations, where the expressions may be mistaken, or not rightly remembered? I can have, I ought to have, no hesitation in a case of this sort.  Upon the whole gentlemen I think your letter to the Governor of North Carolina contains matter very improper to be sent for many reasons, but if you should Continue to think otherwise and conclude to send it, I trust to the wisdom of the Gentleman to whom it is addressed, and to the justice of the State at the head of which he is so deservedly placed, that they will  forbear to withdraw their aid from a Sister State invaded, for reasons on one side of the question only adduced to them, and because among others it is supposed that as I have given my opinion in favor of a question that appears to me to involve the most essential interest of the U. States, that therefore I have discovered resources in South Carolina which enable her to wage war with her single strength against the power of Great Britain?  I am &c.  ""

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia April 4. 1779 I have the honor to inclose you an extract of a letter from my brother William to my brother Frank (1) dated October the 15th 1778, by which it seems Very clear that the Stores you apprehend to have been shipped in September and taken, were not shipped so soon, and therefore I hope may yet be safe.(2) It will be a very unfortunate loss indeed, if the enemy have got them. But if this event has not already taken place, there will be less danger of it hereafter, as I expect that the measures we have taken will remove the enemies privateers from our coast. We have been informed that the Roderigue (Beaumarchais Ship) was to sail in company with three or four large ships for Virginia. I expect that our Stores will come by some of them. It seems that Ford (3) arrived in France from England and applied to the Commissioners representing that he had been made prisoner by the enemy in Virginia and carried to England, he shewed them his appointment of Chaplain to a Continental regiment, and being in distress he prayed their help to get back to Virginia. They assisted him, and he went to Nantes where he took his passage for America. He was taken by a Jersey privateer and made his escape a second time and got to Paris. Then it was that my brother seeing a person whom he had every reason to suppose a good Whig and a persecuted American, and at the same time wanting a Secretary, he employed this person whose abilities he found compitent to the business. But I am very certain that Dr. Lee will not continue Ford an hour in his employment after he shall be informed that suspicion has justly fallen upon his character. Information on this subject was sent by the first opportunity after the Governors letter came to Congress.  A report prevails in New York that the Count D'Estaing has beaten Gen. Grant in St. Lucia and that the British Troops to the southward are very sickly. Gen. Clinton lately undertook an expedition in the Sound, supposed against New London, but he has returned disapointed to N. York. The late violent Snow Storm, we hear wrecked 14 of his Transports on Fishers Island. May the Arm of Providence be thus always stretched out against the foes of freedom.  If Spain should join in the war of which there seems the greatest probability, England must submit or expose herself to almost certain ruin.

I have referred Doctor Cooper to you and have not Time to communicate what I wished, as I find by the Time of Day  APRIL 5, 1779  that the Express will be upon me. I will only be short; Yr. Favors are come to Hand by Doctr. Brown. I doubt whether any great Matter will come from their Contents being read in Congress.(2) They are referred to the Board of War. They will Serve, as The Lords' Protests, to show yr. Sentiments. We have done our best Endeavours except in the Matter of Fortifications at Boston.  I do not think you could possibly intend that I should deliver your Letter to Count D Estaing open, to Mr. G___ d (3) and I have Reasons for not doing it, open or shut.  Your Sentiments about Nova Scotia touch my Heart and will make me industrious to forward them. This very Matter, if known would prevent some others from giving them any Expedition.(4)  I will not write to you in Figures. (5) There are Men, here, in too great Plenty who, think a stark naked Acknowledgemt. of the 13 United States under territorial Limits which Britain will not dispute is all that we are warranted to demand and all that our Allies will support us in the Claim of. Two European Powers have fancied that they could claim the Fishery of the Banks & Gulphs of America not only against their european Nations but agst. all weaker People even bordering on these Sease. A private Party pretend to know possitively that Gr Br. will not be thought to set up a strange Claim if she persists to demand all that she has not given to France. I mean all eastward of the Bounds of Massachusetts. He therefore that says we ought to demand and fight for the same Rights of Fishery as we have always had, is the willfull murderer of thousands, because Allies will not, support us beyond the professed End of the Treaty.  To be sure every Thing looks on our Part like Unpreparedness for even Defence. But if we may not demand what the Deity intended for us we will not formally or impliedly relinquish it. We must at least declare that we mean not by any Words or Treaties be supposed to foreclose future Claims of our Right to catch Fish in all open Seas if we cannot cure them but on our own Lands.  I cannot read over what I have written, but will say more on this head in some more composed minute.  I shall be unpardonable, however, if I do not add a few Words on a private Topic. Mrs. L___ (6) expresses the highest Regard for you & your Lady and wishes me to say how much She is grieved that she is not able to show it in what is now a days called taking Notice of Strangers. Poor Woman! I pity her Feelings, if she was only as Republican in Sentiment as she is truly Generous in Heart she would be freed from much of her Regret on this Occasion by barely considering that her present Incapacity to behave in her old Line of Politeness springs from my strict Attachment to a most glorious Cause.

  My Dear Bror. Philadelphia 5th Apl 1779 Yours of the 1st March came to hand the 29. In my last I gave you a long detail of Mr Ds affairs, (1) intending to say no more on the subject, but finding Your mind impressed with apprehensions that he has suffered by the delays of Congress, & that the Lee's have been the Cause of those delays, I think it but a piece of justice due to their Gentlemen to attempt a removal of Your suspicions, by relating a few facts.  On my arrival here I understood Mr. D had been twice before Congress and had given a detail of their affairs in Europe, it was previously proposed that he should give his detail in writing but this was opposed by his Friends, and the opposition prevail'd, he therefore gave an oral narative in which he laid no charges against those Gentlemen who he has since held up to the world in the most Criminal point of light; this narative he finished with a declaration that he had nothing more to say. Very pressing Business prevented Congress coming to a decision on his affairs, there is no man in the house more anxious for a determination than the Lees have always been, indeed one of those Gentn., viz R.H. Lee was absent when I arrived & did not return to Congress till the latter end of Feby. On the 3d of Decr Congress resolved to take into consideration the State of foreign affairs & to meet in the Evenings for that purpose, of this Mr. D was informed by the President & that such Branches as he had been particularly concerned in wod be duely attended to. In a letter of the 4th he thanked Congress for that intimation & on the 5th addressed himself to the public, complaining that the Ears of their Representatives were shut against him. From this state of facts you may form an opinion of Mr. Ds complaints. I know it will be a matter of wonderment how such conduct shod be passed over unnoticed, but I trust the cause will appear in due time. Mr. D. has since delivered a narative in writing which I am told  APRIL 6, 1779  differs widely from what he delivered Orally as before mentiond. This narrative, which is very lengthey, I intend to procure a copy of, I shall also (when I leave this place) take some other papers with me, which places Mr Ds Charecter in a true point of light. I shall trouble you no more on this subject, unless any new matter shod appear in print which may need explanation in that case shall give you such satisfaction as the case may require.

Clinton was returned, That it was reported in N York that the expedition was over owing to the storm, that there was no account of the return of the British troops or vessels; That Gambier with 6 or 7 Ships & frigates designed 'tis said agst New London were on the outside of East end of Long Island; That the Troops to the Southward were sickly, and that Genl. Grant was beat by the French.  Yesterday Congress received a letter from the General (2) informing that he had recd. a letter from Genl. Putnam advising him that 15 light transports bound from Newport to New York were cast away at Sag Harbour and Gardner's Island in the late Storm.  At the same time we received a letter from the commanding officer of the Fort at Wyoming, (3) that they had been surrounded by a number of Tories & Indians who had destroyed several houses & barns and carried of[f] a considerable number of cattle. Thus, Sir, we have recollected and narrated every thing that hath the appearance of news. As we are situated at the very center of intelligence and this is an interesting period it is natural to think that we are but seldom without news of importance; but it is not the fact. Weeks frequently pass away without a word of information. We hope therefore that we shall not be censured for not writing oftner than we do. Whenever any thing occurs that respects the State, or is of any consequence you may be sure of having it by the first conveyance.  APRIL 6, 1779  It may possibly have reached our State that this State nicely jealous of their honour, had conceived that they were not treated with the same respect & justice as had been shown by congress to others. There have been such suspicions; but they are happily removed. Union and Harmony are the great supports of our Independency.  We have not received the copy of one act since we have been here passed by our State in pursuance of recommendations of Congress; nor of any other acts saving one respecting a supply of Provisions and one relative our Quota of the tax. We should be glad to know what passes in government. We are frequently under embarrassment for the want of such knowledge.  We are this moment informed that the French minister hath recd. advice that Count De Estaing is reinforced and now hath one more ship than Byron, and that the French have retaken St. Martins and another small island, have also retaken a frigate and taken the Liverpool.  We have postponed writing until the post was ready to go out, write in Congress and therefore hope that our Errors & Inaccuracies will be candidly forgiven. We are with the highest Sentiments of Respect, Yr Excellency's, most obedient, hble Servants, William Ellery  John Collins ""

  My Dear Son, Philadelphia, 8th April 1779. I have had the pleasure of receiving your favors from Chester & Baltimore, Your Letters for Camp are gone by the hands of your friend Colo. Meade who regreted exceedingly his missing a rencontre on the Road.  Be assured I shall pay a respectful attention to your friend Doctor Craik. When Mr. James Morris shall enable me you shall be informed of his decision on the Exchange of Horses.  This I hope will overtake you on the way, it will however be with you in a short time as the bearer is to travel swiftly. You will see by the inclosed Copies of correspondence, (1) all that I know at this moment of the delicate subject which you left me engaged in. The Censors from the Land of Turpentine took four days to devise an answer to my first Letter, found themselves hobbled & their reply proves they were a little humbled too- they felt the pressure of the Cord in which they had entangled themselves; at first they kicked violently, for I saw one of them writing the morning after my Letter was delivered, two hours & an half with that Letter before him, which had been previously scan'd by my Colleague(2) & the Circle- who were all much agitated. Three days Calm succeeded & then came forth a Letter of this date expressing a \""reliance on my Candor\"" & leaving room for the exercise of (my) generosity-to demand more than reasonable satisfaction s to shift the ground & to commit an Offence. Under the APRIL 8, 1779  influence of this sentiment I scribbled over my answer of the present date; if the Gentlemen enjoy feelings similar to my own, the affair will not come before Congress. I had every advantage over them that could have been wished for by a vindictive mind, & have disdained to insult Men who have surrendered.  I long to be relieved from a duty which is now become a burthen, & in the honest prosecution of which I am in danger of being betrayed & sacrificed by a Man who ought to love & support me-send forward that relief I earnestly entreat you. Quarrels cannot last long where there are not faults on both sides. I have pursued such steps, suppressed resentments which might have been justified, & so far guarded against a quarrel-but th[ey] cannot command harmony, without which Colleagues cannot proceed in public business to good effect.  I have heard nothing of importance from the Army since you left me- the business which employs me daily seven or eight hours or more at the State House & here is of a secret nature. Therefore I have no News to offer but such as may appear in the printed Papers which I send to Colonel Gervais & to which I refer you. Forty four days have passed since we had any intelligence from Charles Town I suspect the miscarriage of a Messenger.  I intreat you let me hear from you by every opportunity.  I pray God to bless & protect you, Henry Laurens.  P.S. 11th. Since writing as above No. Carolina has been silent, & what is more extraordinary my Colleague has called upon me to confer on business of our Constituents, he met a cordial reception & a frank communication of sentiments on my part.

  Gentlemen, (No. 9) Chesnut Street Philadelphia 8th April 1779 The explanations contained in your Letter of this Morning (1) afford me the satisfaction of feeling myself once more a free Agent. I have, in the course of a two Years acquaintance given you repeated proofs of my abhorrence of that temper which leads some Men to take unfair advantages of the rashness or inadvertency of others. I have the honor of adding another in the present instance, and of assuring you Gentlemen, your confidence in my candor shall not be abused.  Be persuaded Gentlemen, my late Vote, you know what I refer to, and to be more minute would be dangerous, because our correspondence may perchance fall into improper hands, was the effect of as deep meditation  APRIL 8, 1779  as my mind could produce, after listening to, and impartially arranging every good argument pro and con, casting aside such as were \""misty\"" or \""tempestuous.\"" The reasonings in Congress and Conscience, were my Oracles. I neither consulted nor received advice out of doors, directly or indirectly, from any Man-had you been pleased to address me in Person, you would have found me, as you will now find me, determined to pay a respectful attention to the voice of decent expostulation, in full possession of a maxim which has governed my conduct thro' life, \""never to determine on important points until the proper moment,\"" that moment in one stage of the business before us, is past, but the judgment being interlocutory, another, for final decision will arrive, the mean space shall be employed in reconsidering the subject upon the principles of justice, policy, expediency, and even necessity-should I, Gentlemen, eventually differ in opinion with you, let my welfare here and hereafter be forfeited, if my vote be the effect of criminal pertinacity.  Methinks I could in this place administer salutary advice in return for your favors, but it is not my duty nor my wish to catechise, or to put my friends to pain by an application of causticks. My honorable Colleague without my knowledge commenced the seperate correspondence which you regret. I am equally blameless for that circumstance, and for the late general and visible want of harmony with that Gentleman. My own heart is in proper tone. So sensible am I of the critical situation I stand in, that I would give half the fragment of my Estate for the purchase of positive instructions from my Country upon the momentous question which has occasioned you and me the trouble of so much writing. I am almost provoked to add, that I would give it for the pleasure of a confining fit of the Gout; but while I am in health, I dare not meanly turn my back upon duty, from a fear of consequences. I have no overweening Ideas of my own abilities, such as they are, my Countrymen after long experience, sent, and have been pleased to detain, here. They know what they have to rely on respecting myself-whether my vote hereafter shall receive their plaudit or otherwise, I am sure they will never question my integrity.  If there be traits of asperity in my former Letter, which I did not intend, you will be pleased Gentlemen, to consider them as the product of an unexampled outrage on your part, and for which I admit your present Address to be a mark of apology. Here I intreat our correspondence on this subject may expire, and that you will believe me to be, very respectfully, Gentlemen, Your faithful fellow Labourer, & Obedient Humble Servant, (signed) Henry Laurens  ""

7031,dg012358,1779,North Carolina Delegates to Henry Laurens,"""North Carolina Delegates to Henry Laurens
  Sir, (No. 8)(1) Philadelphia, April 8th 1779 We had no Intention or Expectation of entering into a Correspondence with the Delegates of South Carolina, individually, when we officially laid before them our thoughts and purposes relative to a certain Measure depending before Congress;(2) which seemed greatly to depend on your vote, and from the manner in which you gave it, on an Interlocutory motion, threatened, in our opinion, distressing Evils to those parts of the Continent which are not secured by internal Strength and inaccessible situation; and which, for that reason, threatened the State we represent with very Interesting and dangerous Dilemmas.  We are sorry to find that your honorable Collegue and you do not harmonize in this business, and that, instead of your Joint answer, we are to receive only separate letters which convey very different Sentiments. What foreknowledge your honorable Collegue may have had of our Measure we know not, but we assure you it was the result of mature thinking, and of our own Judgments only.  We return you our thanks, Sir, for inclosing to us the Copy of your Intended letter to Governor Caswell:(3) the rather, as it affords us an Opportunity of attempting to remove some mistaken Opinions which you have therein advanced.  We meant not, Sir, to Condemn, or even Censure your Conduct. We saw you Vote for making a very extensive claim of a right of Fishing, an ultimatum on a treaty of peace, even tho' our Allies should be in no Condition to give us assistance; and we could not reconcile this Vote, given by a Delegate from a State which has hitherto been Considered as a very rich and alluring object to the Enemy, but unable to make any Effectual Efforts for her own defense, and which appears but too probably to have of late engaged the Enemy's most hostile Intentions. We say, Sir, we could not reconcile this Vote on any other presumption, than what we have Suggested in our Memorial.  Our View, in that Memorial, was not, as you Suggest to Governor Caswell, \""to attack the freedom of debate and Suffrage, to menace a free Citizen in order to bias his Vote,\"" but to inform the Delegates of South Carolina, that the presumption of exertions to be made by the State we represent is mistaken; and, if it had any Influence in causing you to vote for an object, as an ultimatum, which we all deem highly important, but not absolutely Necessary, to remove all ground for such Influence. Relying on your Candor, we doubted not, that if your Vote was founded, in any degree, on such presumption, you would retract it on the information we gave; and we preferred giving you this Information officially, and in writing, that it might form a proper and honorable Ground for your change of Opinion, as well as a Justification for ourselves. We cannot understand this to be a Menace; and we beg leave to assure you, we are incapable of such motives as you assign: and clear in our Opinion, that  APRIL 8, 1779  threats would be very ineffectually applied to you. Should we see you persist in the Vote, after the information we gave, we should conclude you to be determined by the Idea you have, of adequate force in South Carolina; and, in that event, intended to send forward the letters to the Governor of our State; believeing it our duty to spare the Exertions of our People as much as possible.  We hope we have not misrepresented. We certainly have no such Intentions. Nor, do we conceive, that our Conduct, on the present Occasion, is contrary to our declared maxims, which we sometimes use in debate.  The Measures we recommend, cannot have the effect of \""an abandonment of an Innocent People,\"" or \""endangering the safety of the United States,\"" if the Strength and resources of South Carolina be such, as to warrant her Delegate to vote for a continuance of the War, without Allies, for an Object, not absolutely Necessary to the whole, and, but remotely, if at all, interesting to her. And such Strength and resources make the Efforts of other States, which are made with great difficulty, unnecessary in her present Situation. We may attribute too much to your Opinion; but, we think ourselves Justifiable, from your eminent Character for experience, Industry and Intimate knowledge of your Country, in relying on it, so far as to induce the Measures we propose.  The public secret, which you allude to, is kept on our part. In the Event, that the Fishery claim shall be made an ultimatum, even without allies, we shall feel ourselves under a Tie to our Country, Superior to any which Congress can lay us under; and, foreseeing from it nothing but desolation, or absolute Submission, we shall follow the example of some other Gentlemen, who declare, they will hold themselves bound to lay the matter before the state they represent.  The secret of a \""Plan to hunt you down,\"" is utterly unknown to us; and we hope you are mistaken. We cannot deem any Individual amongst our Body, so dangerous, as to be the object of a Justifiable Combination, nor do we know any one, of Importance sufficient, so much to engage our Efforts and attention; and, we wish you to do us the Justice to believe, we are incapable of so unworthy a Measure.  The Paragraph in your letter, beginning with the quotation from Lord Bacon, is too figurative, and misterious for our Comprehension.  We are sorry you deem us under the Influence of Passion, or that we feel any pique or resentment against you. Permit us to assure you, that, in both, you are Mistaken. We are sensible of no personal Injury from you, and have therefore nothing to resent. We cannot persuade ourselves that you are conscious of having ever designed an ill office to us, and suppose the word resentment was a Slip of your pen. We have not observed in you anything unfriendly, or disrespectful to us; and know of no pique or cause for one to exist.  The manner in which we address you, notwithstanding the asperity of some expressions in your letter to Governor Caswell, applied to us, may, sufficiently, convince you of our good temper. We attribute those asperi-  ties to the mistaken Sense in which you understand our memorial; and therefore, excuse them.  In truth, Sir, the Importance of the object, and its peculiar Consequence to our own particular State, were the only Considerations that moved us to address our Memorial to the Delegates of South Carolina; and, we expected to inform, but not menace thereby.(4)  The letter to the Governor contains Sentiments which we now entertain Hypothetically, and which will be established, or removed by the Event of the Question before Congress, and the Votes thereon.  We are much concerned that you have so widely mistaken us, but we shall be much more so, if your vote shall fix as an Ultimatum those Extensive Claims to Fishing Contended for by the Eastern States.  We leave the Subject entirely to your own good Sense, and cool, dispassionate reflection.  Having the honor to be with due respect, your obedt. Serts.,  John Penn  Whitmell Hill Thos. Burke ""

7034,dg012361,1779,Gouverneur Morris to Joseph Reed,"""Gouverneur Morris to Joseph Reed
  Sir, Phila. 9th April 1779. I this Morning, for the first Time, have seen the Points stated, by your Excellency, on Behalf of the joint Committees of Council and Assembly. (1) I had previously heard a Part of the Substance, together with some other Things which I shall take Notice of in the Course of this Letter. As you must know that Congress has no Control over the Conduct of it's Members, other than what may be necessary for the Order & Decency of Debate, and the better conducting of public Business; you could not be ignorant that any Offence which I had been so unfortunate as to give your State, was by no Means chargeable on the Body I have the Honor to belong to. You will pardon me then, Sir, if I consider every Thing which is personal of me, as having a Tendency to injure me without a Possibility of Doing Good to any Man or Body of Men whatsoever. I shall not enquire into the Motives. I hope they are honorable, because I most sincerely wish, that every Person in Office under the Whigs of America may, at a late Day, have the Consolation of an approving Heart. Let me assure you that it is not in my Intention to cast the slightest Reproach upon you. I know well how much the Conduct of Men is influenced by Circumstances, how open public Men are to Misinformation and the Design of others, and how very difficult it is not to be swayed by Heats on some Occasions. At present I do not write for the Press. It is in your Power to prevent me from harboring the slightest Intentions to do you an Injury. It is also in your Power to compel me to take Measures for my Defence. I shall write to you with Freedom, and I shall expect that you will vindicate me from such Aspersions as you know to be groundless. I ask no more.  Your first Complaint is grounded on my Letter of the 24th of January 1778.(2) Of that Letter I never kept a Copy, but from Memory I state the Matter as follows. The hon'le Mr. Harvie and myself were, at Lancaster, applied to by some british Officers, who complained that they came out under the Protection of the united States pledged by their Generals, that they had paid on the Road for every Thing they purchased in Specie agreable to the Order of Congress; that they had paid their Bill at Lancaster in the same Manner; but that, by Reason of a Law of the State of Pensilvania, the executive Council had compelled the Innkeeper to make APRIL 9, 1779  out a new Bill and charge them of a new for the same Articles at an exhorbitant Rate, because he charged others so who were to pay him in Paper; which they considered as a Violation of the public Faith. I saw at once the Advantage which our Enemies would take of such Circumstances, and how much our national Character for Probity might be injured by their artful Representations. At the same Time, convinced that the Legislature could not possibly have had this Case in Contemplation which indeed was alone to be determined by the Law of Nations, convinced also (and I appeal to your own Good Sense for the Truth of the Position) that Persons in their Situation were not subject to the municipal Laws of the seperate States so long as they demeaned themselves consistently with the Terms they had either tacitly or expressly agreed to, I wrote the Letter in Question. That Letter I believe supports such Sentiments, tho as it was written in the public Room of a Tavern in Haste while on a Journey from York Town to Camp it may want both Accuracy and Precission. Till this Moment I did not know that the Council had complained of it to Congress, nor shall I now make any Remarks on that Complaint. You mentioned the Letter to me at Camp. You censured it as imprudent, urging that the same Sentiments might with great Propriety have been delivered to the President personally; to which I answered, with Truth, that I had not the Honor of his Acquaintance. We had a longer Conversation about it than I thought the Letter deserved. The tedious Altercation was at length closed by an obliging Observation which you uttered with a Smile, \""That you was confident I would not have written it had I taken Time for Consideration and would not do it if it was to do again[\""]. I make no Comments on this Transaction. I think the Council have paid more Attention to the Letter than it was worth. The Rest I leave to you; with an Assurance, however, that if the Use made of it contributed in any Manner to extricate your Council from a Dispute with Congress, which however ridiculous may have been the Causes, might in the Consequences have been very pernicious; if this I say was the Case, you are heartily welcome. For I am well content to be the Peace Offering on this Occasion, saving always my Reputation which I will not part with.  Your next Ground of Complaint is my Appearance before the House of Assembly.(3) Your Words are \""in a Dispute between the contending Parties of this State, to the great Dissatisfaction of the Inhabitants of Pensilvania, who suppose the Delegates of the united States sent here to attend the Affairs of the common Union not to advocate the Measures of any Party.\"" I repeat this Observation because I mean, that, after calling a few Things to your remembrance, you yourself should make the strong Appeal to your own Heart in that cool Moment when the Hurry and the Glare of public Life leave Room to Reflection. Was it an Insult to your Legislature that a Lawyer, being then also a Delegate, should appear before them in a contested Election? Mr. Morris as a Lawyer did not dishonor them, and the Character of a Delegate on the one Hand could not be sullied by   appearing before the Legislature of a State, nor on the other could that Character derogate from that of the Legislature. I have not the Vanity to suppose my Talents were of any Consideration; nor indeed could they have been so. If great the Electors had a Right to the best they could procure and if small it would have been their Misfortune. Justice, I hope and beleive, was the Object on all Hands. Mr Reid as well as Mr Morris was at once a Lawyer and a Delegate. In the Moment of Friendship and Confidence, I told you that I was employed, You never hinted to me that it would be disagreable to your Countrymen. You assured Mr R. Morris and Mr Biddle in my Presence that those who applied for Seats, and whose Cause I was to advocate, were more strong Partizans of the same Side of the Question than those who now sit, And that they mistaking you to be friendly to that Side had applied for your Patronage and Interest with the Assembly on the Ground of their strong Attachment to the Constitution. This then was not advocating the Measures of any Party. But the Sentence is well turned and I forget it.  The third Ground of Complaint against me is the Letter of Robert Lettis Hooper ,(4) on which you say. \""Which Letter was publickly shewn by the said Mr. Morris to the Commander in Chief and others but being demanded by the Delegate of Pensilvania as a high Insult to the State was refused upon the Allegation of it's being a private Letter.\"" The Opposition between publick and private you will I dare say take Notice of. A private Letter may be publickly shewn without the Fault of the Writer. Nor ought he to be prejudiced by the Imprudence of him to whom the Letter is directed. Let me remind you Sir that upon the Receipt of this Letter I shewed it as containing a Piece of News on the one Part, and a very extraordinary Determination on the other. That you pressed for it in Order to lay it before the Council. That I then told you I did not imagine Mr. Hooper meant by Writing that Letter to publish such Determination. That I did not think it written to me as a Delegate but meerly in my private Capacity. That there was Something dishonorable is using such a Communication to the Prejudice of a Man who might have entrusted it confidentially. And that if he really intended to publish such a Determination other Evidence would not be wanting against him. Sir I refused to deliver that Letter, because I think it wrong to turn to a Man's Disadvantage private Communications. I entreated you to consider it as such and by no Means to publish the Contents of that Letter, and I believe you know that it was not shewn by me after your Demand of it. I do not take Notice of the Matter as before the Board of War who I am told can fully exculpate themselves, but I must call to your Remembrance that I chearfully cooperated with you and Doctor Witherspoon in collecting Evidence against this very Mr. Hooper.  I have heard, but I do not recollect my Informant for I cannot believe the Fact, that you asserted to the Assembly, that in a Conversation with me, I had not only declared my Intention to procrastinate a Determination on General Arnold's Case but even pointed out the Mode I would  pursue. It is possible that you may have mistaken or forgotten some Part of that Conversation. You doubtless remember a Letter of yours which brought it on. I make no Comments on that Letter. I called upon you immediately for an Explanation of it. I asked you what I had done prejudicial to your Ease or Quiet. At first you declined entering into any Explanation. I told you that considering what had passed between us we must be upon better or worse Terms. That if any Thing lay upon my Bosom, I would tell it you and ask the Meaning, and that it was your Duty to do the same. That I was ready to explain any Part of my Conduct to you, and if you declined to ask an Explanation and resolved to take Offence the Consequence must lie with yourself. You then complained of the Part I had taken in your Dispute with Genl. Arnold. I told you, and I told you truly, that I had been so unwell for several Days that I could not attend Congress, and consequently had taken no Part in the Business; and further that I had not seen any one Paper relating to it, which was also a sacred Truth. You told me that the Council had Evidence agt. [. . .] Genl. Arnold which Gentlemen of Congress little dreamt of, and that those who supported him would be injured by it. I replied that whenever Evidence offered against him or any other Man, no Member of Congress would exert himself more to see that public Justice was done. I appealed to your own Knowledge of me in the Affair of Hooper &ca. and to the Part I had acted on Mr Laurens's Representation against Mr Robert Morris.(5) You pointed at some Resolution (tho I really forget what) which you thought Congress ought to pass. I did not like it and candidly told you so and my Reasons. You proposed to me the Question how I would act if the Motion was made and the Yeas and Nays called. I told you that I did not believe Congress would give either Yea or Nay upon any such general Proposition. And that for my own Part I should in such Case propose an Amendment. But this had nothing to do with Procrastination, & it would be very singularly hard if a Man should be chargeable with procrastinating public Business, when he proposes to amend what in his Conscience he cannot approve. You observ'd to me that I was wrong in supporting the army for that those Gentlemen were quite assuming enough without any Encouragement. I told you that I could not charge myself with giving them improper Encouragement; and that I was confident they would never be dangerous to the Liberties of America unless from a groundless Distrust of them. You mentioned to me my Vote in the Affair of Genl. Thompson and Mr McKean as a Slight upon Pensilvania.(6) I told you, that on that Occasion Mr McKean the Delegate of Delaware was concerned, and not Mr McKean the Chief Justice of Pensilvania. That Congress had no Right to protect the Privileges of your Chief Justice, however they might have a Right to protect those of their own Members. And that my Vote, in the Consequences of it, might be more injurious to myself than it possibly could be to the State of Pensilvania. I desired you to tell me the Reason of a Coldness and Distance in your Behaviour which I had observed. You assured me that you was not your  self sensible of it. That there was no Cause except what you had mentioned. That you was fully satisfied, and that if any Thing should turn up which gave you Dissatisfaction, you would candidly mention it before you suffered it to make any Impression on your Mind. Some general Conversation on public Affairs ensued, and among other Things, as We both agreed in our Idea that the Publications about that Time had a pernicious Tendency (particularly as they might create and certainly had the Appearance of Disunion). I told you that at the first Leizure Moment I would write a Paper to prevent the Ill Effects of them, which you strongly urged me to do.(7)  I have been told that you have mentioned my Interference in the Affairs of your State Constitution to my Disadvantage. I appeal to yourself Sir, whether this Interference was not founded on a Regard to the Interests of that State and the Happiness of it's Citizens. Whether every Step I took did not meet with your Approbation. And whether the greater Part was not at your Request. For after all what was my Interference, further than bringing you, Mr Morris and Mr Biddle together at my House at your Request, being present at your Conversations and faithfully keeping your Secrets, to which Effect the Honor of every Person present was pledged? Did I do more? Unless indeed when you imagined they would oppose your Election to the President's Chair. You then called upon me. You told me, \""That tho I frequently threw out Things which were not so prudent yet you had an Opinion and really believed I would not do any Thing that was wrong. That it was in my Power to do a great Deal. Mentioned to me the supposed Opposition, and with much Emotion declared that you had not sought public Employment that if you was ill treated you would make it the Business of your Life to oppose them and the like.\"" I obtained Assurances from them that they would support your Election.(8) This and what related to the Delegation of this State which I was only privy to and not active in is all that I know of which looks like an Interference. I did indeed make some faint Endeavors to bring over the Quakers to the Whig Interest or, if that were impracticable, to break their Combination. This Measure if it could have been effected (and I verily beleive with some Moderation on the Part of Government it might have been effected) would perhaps have influenced your Constitution, And so would the acknowledgement of our Independence which it is not on that Account the less my Duty to labor for. I do not blame your Government for not doing what I attempted. For I know that Men in Power are frequently obliged to sacrifice useful and desirable Objects, to others more useful or more desirable.  I will observe to you here, that altho it was in a private and friendly Manner you mentioned to a Gentleman in New York that I kept Company much with Tories, yet as the Communication was made in the first Instance to one who you knew to be at that Time irritated against me I had no small Reason to suspect some other Design. I am not conscious of the Truth of your Observation and I think I once expressed to you the  Pain I felt from so injurious a Report, and that too with much Warmth. But I was so far from obeying Emotions of Resentment, and so far from acting disrespectfully to your State, that I did most earnestly press some Individuals to treat you and your Council with Respect and Attention, and have warmly reprobated Sentiments and Expressions of you and them derogatory to the Honor of Government. I mention these Things to you because it will shew that I am infinitely superior to Littlenesses and Personalities, much more to the abomimable Meanesses which some have thought proper to charge me with.  A Slander hath been so industriously handed about to my Disadvantage, that it cannot be without Interest and Design; because I certainly am not of such Importantce, singly considered, as to deserve the Attention lavished by my Detractors. You have heard it, and I have too good an Opinion of you to beleive you will again suffer it to pass uncontradicted. It is on that long contested Affair of the Sloop Active.(9) Two Things are, I am told, asserted. One that I am concerned with Genl. Arnold in the Purchase of a Share of that Vessel. Another that I attempted to suborne Witnesses. I shall not enter into the Merits of the Cause, they are not to the present Point. But I must repeat to you what I have before mentioned which I think were we to change Places I should have urged in the Teeth of such Reports against you. I do not to this Moment know whether Genl. Arnold is interested in her. On the one Hand there are it is true some Circumstances to induce such a Belief; and on the other is a solemn Declaration to the contrary, which one of the Captors made to me. But be that Matter as it may; I undertook the Suit because it appeared to me just, and because, the Captors being represented as Poor, I did not beleive there were many of the Profession who would as I did undertake to serve them for Nothing. Genl. Arnold indeed proffered to be their Security to me for any Fees which I might demand, but I told him and them, that if they recovered they might pay me, if they lost the Suit they lost enough and should be welcome to my Services. Of this I formerly assured you and you have had no Reason to doubt of the Truth of it. The Ground of the other Report you are fully possessed of and mentioned to me long ago, if that can be called a Ground which is so weak and futile. Mr Jackson, a sick Gentleman from Jamaica, who was a Witness in that Cause on the Part of your Clients had taken Offence at Something I said which carried to his Mind the Idea that I thought he might be influenced by the Gift of what he had on Board the Vessel to give false Testimony against the Captors. This he mentioned to you. I took the first Opportunity after you had told me of it, to convince Mr Jackson of his Mistake, which was done in such Manner that he appeared to be perfectly satisfied. The Fact was this. Genl. Arnold sent for Mr. Jackson to enquire into the Nature of the Case. I was present when he came, and in the Course of the Conversation I put some Questions to him. After that was over, then, as a Gentleman who felt for and wished to releive Distresses which (from the Mutability of human Affairs) he might in his Turn be afflicted with, I enquired into his   Health and Circumstances; and as he had open Letters to New York, I asked for those which were directed to my forrner Friends there, or were written by any such in Jamaica, intending if it were necessary to aid his Negotiations for Money in this City. He had not his Letters with him but assured me that on these Subjects he was perfectly at Ease. I then as an American expressed my Hopes that he had not been plundered or ill treated by my Countrymen, and my Confidence that, notwithstanding the apparent Ingratitude of their Conduct, at which he seemed much enraged, they would not take from him his wearing Apparel, and such other Things as it had been customary to leave in the Possession of Persons in his Situation. How he came to misinterpret what I said I cannot concieve, but the Fact stands as I have stated it, and no one who knows me, nor indeed any other but a very base and wicked one will beleive me capable of the Infamy of suborning a Witness.  Another Insinuation against me no less cruel is, that I support Mr. Deane from interested Motives. If by supporting Mr Deane is meant the just & honorable Support which is due from a Representative of America to a Servant who asks for Justice, I am proud to declare that I have given and will give it, tho I disdain to sell it either for Price or Condition. But if by Support is meant Assistance in Fraud or Guilt I repel the Calumny and I despise the Calumniator. While Mr Deane was a Petitioner to be heard, I maintained his Right to a fair and a candid Hearing, with the Warmth, not of an Advocate but, of an honest Representative whose Duty it was to do Justice to the Public and to Individuals. If he shall appear to be guilty I will condemn and prosecute him and if innocent I shall endeavor to place that Innocence in it's proper Light. But the Supposition that I forward his Views (if any he has) to future foreign Employment is ridiculous. Mr Deane considered in himself is not the Negotiator I should chuse under his present Circumstaces, tho compared with some now Employed and others who wish to be employed he has an infinite Preference. Nor can I, notwithstanding Appearances, perswade myself that you really second the Views of Men who have already attempted to blast your Reputation, or of a Party whose Enmity you must be fully convinced of whatever may be their present Professions. Neither can I believe that you have such Weakness as to sacrifice the permanent Interests of this State to any momentary Objects which now offer themselves.  It is hardly worth mentioning further that as it serves to shew how sedulously some Persons employ themselves to my Prejudice that Enquiries have been made whether I am not concerned with Mr Deane in Trade. There is Nothing which may not be overdone, and this is among the Number of those Things which must soon recoil upon the Inventors. I am well content that my Conduct be probed to the Bottom, and I trust will then appear to deserve, not the Forgiveness, but the Applause of my Country.  I have mentioned above a Publication which you urged me to make, but which hath as I have been informed given you Offence. How this can  be I know not. My Object was to prevent our Friends from being alarmed and our Enemies encouraged by the Appearances of Disunion. Similar Motives appear to have prompted your Measures for Healing the Dispute of your Council with Congress. Between the Time of conversing with you and that of Writing the Publication, this Dispute had begun to take a serious Turn, and the Honor and Justice of Congress were impeached. I think it essential to the Safety of America that her Representatives should be properly respected, which cannot be while their Conduct is marked by Folly or Iniquity. To justify them was a Duty. I know of no Principles of Friendship or Regard by which I was bound to treat your Council with peculiar Tenderness. I have spoken of them in that Publication not disrespectfully, and perhaps the Moment will arrive when they will do Justice to the charitable Sentiments which it breathes. It would be Blindness however not to see the clear and strong Lines drawn between you and them. I can distinguish the Conduct which is purely your own, from that which you may be in a Manner compelled to by those about you. I know enough of Power, to judge with Charity of those who possess it; nay more to pity them, for I know it s Bitternesses. And of all the Anguish which attends it, the being hurried by others into a Subserviency to their Views is not the least, tho often times a necessary Sacrifice to the Public Good. For the present I shall make no Parade of what I might have done for myself, or what I have done for the Public, and on the other Hand I shall not alter, even to yourself, some things the Publication of which would not redound either to your Ease or Quiet. I beleive you must be convinced that I am by no Means a hollow Friend, and I assure you that if compelled to be your Enemy, you shall find me a generous one. The Choice is in yourself, for I ask no more than that you will on proper Occasions do me the Justice to contradict Aspersions which you know to be false. (10)  I have the Honor to be, very respectfully, Your Excellencys most obedt. & humble Servant, Gouv Morris  ""

We shall embrace the first favorable opportunity for laying the requests of the State before Congress, and will hope they will be complied with.  Congress have under consideration further measures for the defence of South Carolina. They had recommended to that State to purchase and form two battalions of black men, the purchase money to be paid by the Continent. They have also recommended to the States of Virginia and North-Carolina to inlist a body of militia for the defence of the Southern States, the bounty money to be paid by the continent &c. These examples will be in favour of the application of our State; but the large Sums of money which these bountys, and the bounty for recruiting the quotas of the several States, the purchase money before mentioned, and the necessary supplies for the main army require will be in our way.(2) However we shall exert our best abilities on this occasion, and if we cannot command Success we will endeavour to deserve it.  We are informed that the Captain of a Vessel which arrived here last Saturday from Surrinam advises that his and six other Vessels were convoyed from thence by a dutch Ship of War until they were thought to be out of danger from the enemy; and that the Governor had offer'd them Cannon &c for their defence.

Lee, and apprehending something like a party respecting him to subsist, and unwilling to say any thing that might be made use of on either side, I answered with caution and reserve, and only said in general that he was considered as a man of parts, that this Idea of him was founded more on the reputation he had brought with him from England than on any thing he had done amongst us. Several attempts were made to get me to declare whether he had the full Confidence of the Court of France, and I waived answering as much as good manners would permit, and only said generally that the Congress had confided in him, and therefore the Court of France paid him all due respect. In short whatever good I could with Justice say of the Gentleman, I said expressly. When Questions were put to me which might be answered against him, I observed a reserve and Silence from whence a man of Sense might easily conclude that the answers which must in truth be given to them, if I was pressed to it would not be in his favor. I was determined to this manner of conducting myself in the Conversation by my sense of good breeding, and my reluctance to speak evil of any person.  Mr. Saml. Adams afterwards pressed me closely, and directly to this point, finding I could no longer avoid it without rudeness, I determined to be candid and explicit with him, and accordingly delivered myself to him at large upon the subject to the following Effect.(3)  I must confess that Mr. Arthur Lee was suspected by People of all ranks, and even of the highest in France, of being unfriendly both to France and America, and the Ministry were sollicited to exclude him from all Negotiation. The Ministry observed that he was confidentially entrusted by the Congress, and therefore that there ought to be good proof of want of Integrity before a resolution should be taken openly to exclude him-they for this reason desired to know what proofs could be given- the following circumstances were then adduced, and much Insisted on. Mr. A. Lee kept up a continued connection with several Principle men in England who were intimate with the Cabinet, those persons came frequently to Paris and conversed with him privately, and unknown to the Ministry, and to his Collegues. He frequently sent his Secretaries and Messengers to London, unknown to his Collegues and the Ministry, and they returned again without their business or the result of their Journies being known either to his Collegues or the Ministry. He had no Intimate in France but Count Loriga (4) who was a man of high Spirit, high fortune, and high birth, and from the Misfortune of some Malady or disappointment had conceived great disgust against the French Court, Ministry, and Nation, had removed his Fortune chiefly into England, had connected himself with Charles Fox, and several of the English Politicians and usually railed against France in the manner of the most enraged Englishman. This man was generally observed to speak of the Conversations which Mr. A. Lee had had with the Ministry, and to publish the particulars without  reserve, also to use the same angry and contemptuous Language which Mr A. Lee had been frequently hear'd to use against the French Nation and Ministry.  The Ministry however on Considering all those Circumstances did not think them proof sufficient to warrant their excluding a man who had been trusted by Congress from all knowledge of the Negotiations which related to them, and the Count (5) observed that he found there was some things which he had communicated to Mr A. Lee which he found Count Loriga was not informed of, and he therefore Concluded that Mr A. Lee observed some reserve to this Indiscreet man-and that he might still be safely trusted with some Confidence.  Mr Laurens also Conversed with me on this Subject, and I observed the same Conduct as I did in conversing with Mr Lee and Mr Adams. Mr Laurens observed it, and told me he saw I was willing to say all the good I could but no evil.  Upon the whole the conclusion that Mr A Lee had the full confidence of the Court of France could only be drawn from my not denying it possitively which good breeding, and a reluctance to say any thing which might be used by his Enemies, if he had any, against him, prevented me from.

  My Dear son, Philadelphia, 16th April 1779. I beg leave to refer to my last Letter to you under the 8th Inst. by Messenger Thomson.  The Delegates of North Carolina have continued perfectly silent since my address to them of the 8th. altho I know they had essayed a reply, but second thoughts are sometimes best. For two or three days they seemed to gnash, placidity followed & yesterday free conversation & harmless. These Gentlemen have roused me to look into the business which was the ground of their first rude resentment, I have discovered such records as had not been thought of by any body else, or to speak more certainly, had not been introduced-& I am confirmed in my original opinion-Justice & sound Policy, forbid receding from the Vote which has given those Gentlemen Offence. Expediency & necessity, which I do not admit, may be with equal propriety, be urged as good reasons for surrendering our  APRIL 16, 1779  Liberty & Independency. I had viewed the detention of the Convention Troops, in the light of a great stroke & as not a trial, the Resolution of the 22d April 1778, another, this like the Sailor's gale of Wind, feels the heaviest but I am confident I shall weather it.  Six Merchant Vessels laden with various kinds of wet & dry goods arrived yesterday at this City after Passage of fourteen days from Martinico, 'tis said the Deane Frigate their Convoy is in the River, others say she was left off the Capes in pursuit of an English Privateer, we are also told that fifteen other Vessels were ready to Sail from Martinico for this port-not a word of Count d'Estaing or other Interesting public Intelligence has yet reached me.  Mr. Gervais will show you the Public Prints & Mr. Wells two New York-Garrison Papers which contain trifles.  It having been intimated to Mr. Langworthy that he had been sitting in Congress the last two Months without authority, he first examined very narrowly his old credentials, then said he had a new appointment at home, but has not exhibited his appointment nor himself since the 12th or 13th Inst. If it should be, as we believe it to be, that he has not a new mission, what shall be done with that Gentleman's important Yeas & Nays from the of February last? Some people are so ill natured as to say, what I will not at present repeat. (1)  I have not heard any thing lately from Camp-write to me often & largely.  I pray God to give you success in all your laudable purposes & to bless you with health, Henry Laurens.  ""

  My Dear Son. Philadelphia 18th April 1779. I had the pleasure of writing to you the day before yesterday by Messenger Durst. Last evening the Packet which will accompany this came to me under cover from Colo. Hamilton, he says it contains two Letters from your Mrs. Laurens which puts me in mind to forward that which I told you had been illicitly opened. (1) You will also receive two Letters directed to Mr. J. Walton, one to Mr. E. Telfair & one to Count Pulaski which I recommend to the protection of Mr. Gervais or yourself.  The Marquis Britaigne who will be the bearer of this is anxious that I should recommend him to Governor Rutledge.(2) That will be done Marquis, in pursuance of an Act of Congress by the President-Ah! but I am not acquainted with Mr. Jay.  I then promised him to write to Mr. Gervais & to you, although he is personally acquainted with both, which gave him satisfaction; certainly if I were in Charles Town & the Marquis there too, I would show him every mark of civility & attention, & I am persuaded my friends will answer for me. This Gentleman's zeal in our cause must have cost him several Thousands of Louis d'ors, besides much personal suffering; he has been waiting upon Congress almost a whole Year in humble dependence, free from that inquietude which from almost all his Countrymen we have been witnesses of, & yet, there has been great stumbling at a proposition for allowing him 5000 Paper equal to about 400 Silver Dollars, nor did we surmount the difficulty in one step first 3000, then 2000-carefully adding \""he to be accountable.\"" We swallow Camels & strain at gnats. APRIL 18, 1779  Our friend Baron Stuben had intimated expectations of pretty large pecuniary compensation, for his expences coming to & in America over & above the pay of Major General, & also for his own expences & those of Mr. Fleury, Mr. L'enfant & Mr. Duponceau, a Report was thereupon introduced from the Board of War, the whole seemed to me, to be incongruous with his propositions at his arrival in York Town,(3) I was therefore induced to call for certain documents & Papers relative to the subject in order to enlighten such of our Members as would otherwise have been ignorant, but I made no opposition to the Report, some busy Body must have taken an advantage of my conduct & misrepresented me to the Baron, otherwise the following dialogue three days ago when he dined with me could never have happened.  What is the reason Mr. Laurens that Congress will not allow me my expences, I told them I was not Rich & I am sure the Committee at York Town promised me.  Why Baron I cannot answer for the conduct of Congress, for my own part I would recommend to you not to press that subject at the present moment, every Member of Congress is sensible of your merit & deserving, I cannot just now so fully assign reasons, as I may at a future time, but if I were to advise, you would delay your demands until our affairs shall be a little better arranged.  His declarations to me at York Town were that he would expect nothing till the end of the War his running expences excepted-Congress gave him two or four Horses & a Commission of Major General, Paid all his Expences at & traveling from Boston, at York Town &c &c.  Well replied the Baron, for myself I will take your advice I will ask nothing yet-I will go to the Army & proceed in my duty-but why will they not do something for Fleury & the other young Gentlemen who have assisted me in my work?  Congress Sir, will undoubtedly do every thing that is just & reasonable, there's no Man who has a greater esteem & affection for Colo. Fleury than I have, but let us consider a little Baron is not Mr. Fleury now within one grade of Generalship, how long must he have served in his own Country before he would have arrived at this eminence, with large & honorable testimonials in his Pocket.  But my dear Mr. Laurens, Mr. President he cannot live by his appointment, & he must go home if you do not do something for him.  You very well know Baron, the state of our Army & the state of our finances-if the case be so, that Colo. Fleury cannot stay with us unless Congress will do something more for him & that Congress cannot do any thing more for him, the consequence will be that he must go home, I shall be very sorry for it.  The Baron, in no small shew of Choler & rage, although in presence of 4 or 5 other guests, answered, Then, I will go home, I will not stay.  O Baron Baron, you had just determined the contrary, excuse me for saying, this is really taking advantage of my candor, you will make me   more cautious hereafter if you persist in these sentiments-what else could I have said, speaking as an honest Man, if Colo. Fleury cannot continue with us upon his present appointments & Congress will not because they cannot, with propriety, enlarge them-& he himself points out the alternative, what else could I have said, but I hope Baron you will not make me answerable for all the determinations of Congress. When I am there, I am an individual & speak my sentiments or give my voice without fear, prejudice or partiality. I pray you Baron think better of this matter. We went to dinner, the Baron looked grave, I made attempts to raise him, he retired earlier than usual & if I do not mistake with a consciousness of a little transgression. The Deanites are incessant in their endeavors to raise a dis-esteem for me in the minds of foreigners, but they make no more impression upon mine than they would upon adamant with a Goose quill. I will endeavor to do right, if I do not gain their applause, I shall nevertheless enjoy an assurance of having deserved it-to be an honest Statesman produces a Man some troubles, but not so many I believe as attends a dissembling knavish one, therefore I'll pursue the old track. I could recite another conversation with a greater Man than Baron Stuben which would more than equally astonish you, but, it wont do. & I think the irregular measures which are adopted are arguments, proving, why it ought not.  When Baron Stuben first addressed Congress he produced a Letter from Mr. Deane announcing him Lieutenant General & Quarter Master General in the King of Prussia's Army, hence I was led to give him the Title of Excellency, in my early correspondence; sometime after he went to Camp at Valley forge I was well informed that he had never advanced near the Rank of Lieutenant General, the Baron did not say to me that he had, but he did not disown it. Mr. Deane intimated that at some former time he had seen his Commissions, but that when he was about to leave Paris in order to embark for America he was not possessed of them, having left them in Germany, & this moment it strikes me, that the Baron might have misconstrued & misapplied my question, How long must Colo. Fleury have served? &c-but upon my honor I had no design to touch him nor, as I have said above, did I ever think of the subject in this light until the present Instant. However if he has committed himself it is not my fault. If he felt any thing like an attack it was from within his own Breast, neither duty nor inclination could possibly have misled me to upbraid a Man with whom I wished to have continued in friendship. But the times are distempered & the Devils of avarice & ambition are indefatigably improving them to their own advantage.  20th. 'Tis rumored the Enemy have taken the Town of Providence, I do not believe it. You will see the News Papers in Mr. Gervais's hands-tell me if my Country Men wish me to remain here, I don't mean a few of them, but generally. I pray God bless & protect you, Henry Laurens.  ""

  My dear Sir, Shippen Hall in 4th Street Phila. 18th April 1779 Possession is eleven points of the Law, and there are in this City Profligates enough who for a good fee will secure the twelfth point. Thus you seem to be more at mercy now than when Mrs.____ the Tory Doctors wife (1) had residence here. How I came to get possession is another thing, and it may be accounted for this way-On my brothers(2) departure for Virginia last friday I was obliged to decamp from Market street, and it not being easy to find a lodging quickly, my most worthy friend the old Doctor (3) proposed that I should have a room here. The bargain was soon made, I am in your Chamber, and we propose to club for our Marketing. The old gentleman drinks nothing but water, & small beer contents me. The Barrack Master furnishes us with wood, and I assure you we live with great happiness and content, whilst we exhibit an example of the truest republican economy. After quitting the irksome business of Chestnut Street I have the pleasure of contemplating in my old friend what Man ought to be, but what alass he seldom is-temperate, wise, and honest. I am much obliged to you for your favor of the 15th,(4) but I do not despair. I am well satisfied however that we must suffer very considerably before the States in general will feel the necessity of sending wiser and better men to this Assembly. Where a Man by being honest is sure to be oppressed- Where disgrace & ruin are to reward the most faithful services. When the discharge of duty raises up the angry and malignant passions of envy, malice, and all uncharitableness-It is best to retire until necessity has pointed out proper men and proper measures. The party seem long since to have abandoned all thoughts of supporting Deane, but they are determined to sacrifice the Mr. Lees & Mr. Izard to the Manes of their dear unprincipled friend. The doctrine is, that it is too expensive and not necessary to have any Minister at Vienna or Berlin or Tuscany, and that it will never do to try a Man in his absence. Therefore we will damn his reputation with a recal,(5) and let him recover it if he can, in the mean time our Junto will be supplied with places. It is in vain to say that thus to destroy the reputations of Men against whom no shadow of offence ap- APRIL 18, 1779  pears, and who on the contrary have honestly and ably served the public at every risk to themselves, merely to gratify the wishes and accomplish the views of avaricious and ambitious men, will exhibit such an example as must deter every Man who has character to loose, and means to be honest, from entering into the public service. That so the public business must of necessity be committed to unprincipled men, and avaricious plunderers. By the aid of a certain little great whispering politician (6) this point of sacrifice will I think be carried. Fine reward, excellent encouragement to give up all pro patria. On a late motion to give a million to the Hospital department much violent debate took place and it was insisted on that infinite abuses prevailed and demanded immediate enquiry.(7) It was alledged that great quantities of Stores were charged for Geese, ducks, chickens, &c &c &c &c-That the wine was all drank by the well, & not by the sick-All this ended in reducing the sum to 500,000 dollars. The Southern Chief, (8) who you know is a most excellent character, said he hoped soon for an enquiry into the conduct of the Director General and all the rest. Therefore a prospect of encountering so great a personage makes it necessary to say Cave quod agis. The Dutch having lately taken off the prohibition from the exportation of military stores, which they had imposed to oblige Great Britain, clearly proves that the interest of England is waining in Holland. There have arrived 7 Vessels here lately from the West Indies, which has terrified the Specs and lowered the price of sugar £20 in the hundred. It is said that many more Vessels are expected. Trade appears to thicken along the Wharfs and Marine business is recovering its former countenance. I shall go to Virginia in a fortnight where I hope to rest from public toil for some time at least. I think you are with Mr. Blair & his Lady, if so, I pray you to remember me to them, and present my Sister and Cousins.  I am yours sincerely and affectionately, Richard Henry Lee  ""

  Dear Sir l9th April [1779] Your Excellency's favor of the 20th Ulto (1) I had not dared to open until my late penitential Address of the 16th Inst had been despatched, speaks your kindness and even partiality to poor-me, and demands my most humble acknowledgments. No, my dear Sir, I had never the vanity to believe you had courted either the President, or the Mr Laurens. I could very exactly trace out my late fault from its origin, in the beginning I was not so much to blame but when I reflect upon the whole progress, shame covers me, and especially at this moment when your friendly Letter above mentioned lies in my view. I must say as we used to say, some forty or fifty years ago, \""Indeed Sir I will never do so again.\""  \""I hear there are divisions amongst you and I partly believe it,\"" True, pretty true Sir. Did your Excellency ever know it otherwise amongst Men who were not all of one Mind? And yet 'tis that plaguy thing being all of one mind which produces the division. Your Lawyer-Apostle Sir, and we  APRIL 19, 1779  know that ever in this pure age that pious tribe, meaning no offence to anybody, undertake by the same chain of reasoning to prove right and wrong. I say Sir your Author also tells us \""for all seek their own.\"" Is not this being all of one mind? but anyhow as they say in this Country, if Your Excellency will not affirm this sophistry to be good Logic, you will at least understand me. If I thought it were possible to be otherwise I would give another Scrap from Holy writ \""Loaves and Fishes\"" should this fail, I would add in plain terms, but it should be said in Your Excellency's ear and to remain there a few days longer, that a certain Man pressing upon his Masters the necessity of employing him again in a Public character,(2) attempting to shew in one view his desire and his pretended abilities for obtaining a large sum of Money on Loan, was at the same time engaged in co-partnership with no less than five of his said Masters within the Walls, and with other Persons of power and influence within a small circumjacent circle. Trading Houses were, and for aught I know to the contrary, are to be established on both sides the Atlantic in various parts forming in the whole a magnitude far exceeding anything known in the annals of American Commerce. This is saying the least. Would not the full execution of this project be both safe and honorable to the thirteen United States of America? Can I meanly, tamely look on such proceedings? No! why then Sir, divisions follow. I have neither Ambition nor avarice to gratify, One third part of my Estate is absorbed-the remainder is in very great jeopardy, and here I continue contentedly drudging without sleeping one wink the less from apprehensions of what is passing, in Carolina, but notwithstanding, this quietude of mind under losses and accidents inevitable and irresistable. I hate and oppose Knaves, those more especially who had persuaded me to believe them honest. Sometimes with Mercutio I say \""a pox o' both their houses,\"" and when they vex me very much, I exclaim in the language of honest Othello, \""Let their own Gods damn them,\""(3) The cursed business which is alluded to, has employed your Servants in doing nothing several Months.  The contents of the \""Budget\"" as far as I am acquainted with them have been from time to time retailed in the Newspapers by some diligent hand, well acquainted with the whole subject-the difficulty will be to collect and arrange the several parts to this, and the whole story will be seen in a string.  But to be more serious. Indeed Sir I do not think all the present Attornies nearly equal to a right discharge of the momentous business at this instant committed to them. Ask, who's incompetent? I will honestly and unostentatiously answer I, and yet my Country will keep me here. More ample abilities stay at home to save and to make money, and to kiss their Wives.  But let us turn Sir to Congress where you \""hope things grow smoothly and that all are patriots in the ancient sense of the word.\"" Upon my honor Sir scarce as such jewels are, I believe that taking into consideration numbers and circumstances of wealth, real or imaginary, There are as many  patriots now on this Land as History can shew to have been in any Country, at any one period of time. Reduce us all to poverty and cut off or wisely restrict that bane of Patriotism, Commerce, and we shall soon become Patriots-but how hard is it for a rich, or covetous Man to enter heartily into the Kingdom of Patriotism?  As to the \""smoothly\"" I may reply, we are sliding downwards, in which there is no great difficulty. We have learnt to depreciate the value of our Paper by Financeering, One thing may save us. This can only be accomplished by our Constituents. Order the doors to be opened that every Citizen may know what his servant is doing, particular cases excepted, or clamour until the Journals are printed and published weekly.  Our Chaplain had so long prayed to God to bless us (4) whom he had set over so great a People; as perhaps had intoxicated some of us into an opinion of being actually set over the People, But I gave the Doctor (5) a hint t'other day, and he now prays, \""for whose service they are appointed.\""  Sir I dare not say all to you that I wish, but I dare say, and dare cry aloud that these States are in very great danger of a most violent convulsion.  I will say no more at present but to thank you again Sir for your kindness, and to repeat that I am, with the highest Esteem &c,  H.L [P.S.] It is said the Room is not large enough to admit of open doors-an excellent reason lose the States in preference to building a proper room.

  State House 19 April 1779. The Marine Committee determined on Saturday evening the 17th instant to dispatch the Packet Eagle to Charles Town with Military Stores-That she should be convoyed part of the way by the Cutter Revenge of 18 guns provided the State of Pennsylva. could spare the Revenge for that purpose  That the frigate Deane of 30 guns should convoy the Packet the whole way to Charles Town.  The Chairman of the Marine Committee has waited on the President of Pennsylvania and find that the Cutter Revenge is not at the disposal of the State, it seems doubtful therefor whether the Cutter can be obtained, so that the Deane frigate can only be relied upon for Convoy.  The Committee were desirous of collecting a Marine force in order to attack the enemies Ships on the Coast of Georgia-And the best measures are taking to get together the following Ships, Confederacy of 32 guns, Warren 32, Deane 30, Ranger 18, Queen of France 20. The first of these Ships we hear is blocked up at New London, but the Committee think she may get out and have directed it accordingly. (1) The Deane is now in the Delaware.

  Sir, Philadelphia Apl. 20th 1779 After having made the necessary preparations we moved Congress, agreeably to your direction, on Saturday last. (1) Our motion met with great opposition, owing principally to the States offering an additional pay of six pounds per month. If this was allowed it was said that Congress would be obliged to advance the pay of the contl. battalions, which would occasion such a large sum of money to issue as would intirely overwhelm and destroy the sinking Credit of our Currency. We were obliged to submit to an amendment to this purpose, that the said brigade should be \""intitled to contl. pay, cloathing, subsistance, and to a bounty not exceeding two hundred dollars.\"" Congress adjourned before the Amendment passed. Yesterday we brought the matter on the carpet again,(2) when the bounty was objected to, it being the same as the bounty given to contl. Soldiers who should inlist during the War. After much debate it was reduced to APRIL 20, 1779  150 dolls., which is the bounty offered by the State. The reason why two hundred dollars bounty was proposed was because that was the bounty which was allowed to the troops to be raised in N. Carolina & Virginia. We imagined that we had got through all our difficulties; but now it was contended that the resolution did not restrain the State from giving the additional pay, and that it ought to be restrained, and therefore an Amendment was proposed, that after approving the raising a brigade, to be cloathed, paid, subsisted and to be allowed a bounty not exceeding One hundred and fifty dollars, words like these should be added, \""upon these Conditions that the State should not give any additional pay to the contl. pay.[\""] Here a debate arose which was contd. until the time arrived for an adjournment. How this matter will be decided or when I cannot tell. We are determined to attempt bringing it on this day again. While I was writing the last Sentence an Opportunity offerd. We embraced it; But it was obliged to give way to the order of the day. We will continue to urge this matter to a conclusion, until it be finished.  Since this motion hath been on the carpet, We have received a letter from the Lieut Govr., in which he desires that Congress might determine which they would chuse, that the continental battals. should be filled or the proposed brigade. We have not proposed that Question because it would in our opinion intirely defeat the design of the Assembly expressed fully in your excellency's letter, and we were uncertain whether his Honor's letter was private or official. Mr. Ellery hath written fully to the Lieut Governor on this Subject and begs your Excellency to be referred, for want of time and on account of the situation he writes in, to that letter.(3)  We have laid the business of the Alteration of the Route of the Post through our State before the Post-office Committee, and the Committee have directed Mr Hazard to take measures immediately for the Posts proceding in his usual route.(4) I saw Mr. Hazard this morning and he assured me that he would immediately persue the orders of the Committee.  We have nothing new excepting what is in the inclosed Papers. It is said that a Vessel hath arrived at Chesapeak-Bay from France. Whether it be true or not we cannot tell, nor whether if it be true She hath brot any news. We are in daily expectation of intelligence from Europe, when any arrives we will communicate it.

  Dear Sir Philadelphia 21 April 1779 Accept my Thanks for the long & friendly Letter of the 14 Inst. which I have had the Pleasure of recieving from you. (1) It was for many Reasons grateful to me. I value the Esteem of the wise and virtuous, and had wished to know the particulars of Transactions, respecting which only vague and unsatisfactory Reports, had come to my Knowledge. Delicacy forbid my breaking the Subject to you when here. I was sure of your Politeness, but not certain of a more than usual Degree of Confidence. The latter is now become manifest, and permit me to assure you it shall be mutual.  The Impression attempted to be made, has not taken. It passed without a single Remark. Your Friends thought it merited nothing but Silence and Neglect. The same Reason enduced me to take no Notice of it in my Answer.  I have perused the several Papers with which you favored me. The Delicacy, Candor & Temper diffused thro' your Letters, form a strong Contrast to the Evasions & Design observable in some others. Gratitude ought to have attached a certain Gentleman to the Friend who raised him. A spurious Ambition however, has it seems made him your Enemy. This is not uncommon. To the Dishonor of human nature, the History of Mankind has many Pages filled with similar Instances; and we have little Reason to expect that the Annals of the present, or future Times, will present us with fewer Characters of this Class. On the contrary, there is Reason to expect they will multiply in the Course of this Revolution. Seasons of general Heat, Tumult and Fermentation favor the Production & Growth of some great Virtues, and of many great and little Vices. Which will predominate, is a Question which Events not yet produced, nor now to be discerned, can alone determine. What Parties and Factions will arise, to what Objects be directed, what Sacrifices they will require, and who will be the Victims, are matters beyond the Sphere of human Prevision. New Modes of Government not generally understood, nor in certain Instances approved-Want of Moderation and Information in the People-want of Abilities & Rectitude in some of their Rulers-a wide Field open for the Operations of Ambition-Men raised from low Degrees to high Stations, and rendered giddy by Elevation, and the Extent of their Views-Laws dictated by the Spirit of the Times, not the Spirit of Justice APRIL 21, 1779  and liberal Policy-Latitude in Principles as well as Commerce-Fluctuation in Manners, and public Counsels-Suspension of Education-Indifference to Religion, and moral Obligations &c &c. are Circumstances that portend Evils which much Prudence, vigor and Circumspection are necessary to prevent or controul. To me there appears Reason to expect a long Storm, and difficult Navigation. Calm Repose and the Sweets of undisturbed Retirement, appear more distant than a Peace with Britain. It gives me Pleasure however to reflect, that the Period is approaching when we shall become Citizens of a better ordered State; and the spending a few troublesome Years of our Eternity in doing good to this and future Generations is not to be avoided or regretted. Things will come Right, and these States will be great and flourishing. The Dissolution of our Governments threw us into a political Chaos. Time, wisdom and Perseverance will reduce it into Form, and give it Strength, Order and Harmony. In this Work you are (in the Stile of one of your Professions) a master builder, and God grant that you may long continue a free and accepted one.  Thus my dear Sir! I have indulged myself in thinking loud in your Hearing-it would be an Hybernicism to say in your Sight tho in one Sense more true. It is more than probable that I shall frequently do the like. Your Letter shall be my Apology-and the Pleasure resulting from Converse with those we esteem, my motive.  I am Dear Sir with perfect Esteem & Regard, Your most obedt. Servt. John Jay.  ""

  [April 21? 1779](1) The subscriber Certifies, that in a conversation which he had the honor of holding sometime after his arrival at Philadelphia with Messrs. Colonel Lee & Samuel Adams, the latter spoke to him of reports which circulated that Mr. Arthur Lee was anti-gallican & averse from the Alliance of France with the United States, that the answer of the subscriber was, that in fact a great number of persons among whom were some of distinguished rank, were persuaded of it & had strove to inspire the King's Ministers with the same sentiments, that the subscriber recounted to Messrs Lee & Adams the principal facts upon which that opinion was founded but that the Ministers of His Majesty had not adopted that mode of thinking in regard to the attachment of Mr. Arthur Lee for the cause of America & for the Alliance.  APRIL 21, 1779  It is proper to add that there was no mention in that conversation of the confidence or of the full confidence of the french Ministry in Mr. Arthur Lee.  Mr. Samuel Adams may at his will make such use of the present Certificate as he shall judge proper. At Philadelphia the 21st of April 1779. Seal. signed Gerard (2)  I the subscriber do Certify, that in a conversation which the Honorable Mr. Gerard honoured me with, at my own House, & which he introduced on Sunday the December 1778, He informed me that Mr. Arthur Lee had given much dissatisfaction to the Ministers at the Court of France by his manner of enquiring into & interfering in transactions at that Court relative to America, that he had at different times discovered such jealousies & suspicions as had obliged the King's Ministers or Mr. Gerard himself to signify to Mr. Lee that his conduct was disagreeable, but in other respects Mr. Lee stood fair-that there had been reports circulated of Mr. Lee's too strong attachment to the English & an equal dislike to the french Nation & that such reports had made an impression upon the minds of several persons of Rank about Court & had even reached the King & his Ministers & caused some uneasiness-that the King or His Ministers had thereupon caused the fullest enquiry to be made (had taken the proper means for enquiring) the result of which was, the Court were perfectly satisfied the Reports were groundless-this was repeated, as I understood it, to impress my mind.  On (Monday 19th) Friday 16th April 1779.  I received in Congress a Note from Mr. Gerard intimating that he had just called at my House & requesting I would give him an opportunity of speaking one word to me. I immediately waited on Mr. Gerard, who told me he had been informed Mr. Samuel Adams had said in Congress, \""he had the highest authority for beleiving that Mr. Arthur Lee was in the full confidence of the Court of France\""-that he should be sorry to meddle in that matter, but if he was called upon, if he was forced, he would speak out-that he wished to have nothing to do with it, but if he was forced he should declare very plainly what he knew, the same terms were often repeated by Mr. Gerard, in a manner which discovered that he was more than a little affected.  I reminded Mr. Gerard of what he had done me the honor of communicating to me in December, as above recited-Mr. Gerard replied, \""you are very right, it was precisely so\"".  If I understand you rightly Sir, said I, Your representations concerning Mr. Lee amount to this-\""Here is a Gentleman in my House whose manners do not please the family, therefore it is necessary he should withdraw from it, but if I am asked the cause of the seperation, I will not say he is a Rogue, I will say his dispositions were not pleasing to me, I found it therefore necessary we should live under different Roofs, but I beleive him nevertheless to be an honest Man.[\""]  Mr. Gerard said, \""you understand me perfectly & have explained the case according to my meaning.\"" When I was taking leave Mr. Gerard repeated that he should be sorry Mr. Saml. Adams should force him to speak, he wished to have nothing to do in the matter. 16th April 1779. Henry Laurens  Remarks.  It is easy to account for the Reports of Mr. A. Lee's anti-gallicanism. Mr. Deane was in Paris.  Mr. Lee had, as much as in him lay, been a Check upon Mr. Deane's schemes of private Trade & of too freely fingering public Money.  Mr. Beaumarchais, who was in all appearances a Partner of Mr. Deane's, was also in Paris, Mr. Lee had also been a check upon him & he could with equal facility & Success, help Mr. Deane to circulate Reports.  Reports were accordingly circulated & had made impressions so deeply as to reach the King.  Mr. Lee to whose prejudice the whispers had gone round, was put into the Court Alembick, what came forth? a Jealous troublesome, but, Honest Man.  Dare Mr. Deane stand such a trial, I should say, such an ex-parte Inquisition? No, he has told you he would not answer questions which might tend to criminate himself.  But why was Mr. Lee troublesome? Because he checked the unfaithful acts & attempts of Mr. Deane & his Partners & because he was faithful to the United States of America & insisted upon making a better Treaty with the Court of France than Mr. Deane had submitted to. Mr. Deane was therefore a favorite, a despisable one indeed! even in the Eyes of those who Palmed him. Mr. Lee was comparatively, a troublesome Man to the french Court; but the French Court do him the justice & the honor of saying, he was faithful to his constituents & that they had found him to be so upon the fullest investigation.  Query. Who informed Mr. Gerard that Mr. S. Adams had in Congress said, so & so? Mr. Adams had not quoted Mr Gerard, as his authority. Unless therefore some Member of Congress had asserted or insinuated a falsehood, or, if you please, a Lie, to Mr. Gerard, he could not have made the applications or drawn the inferences he did in his conversation with me.

  Mr Dunlap, [April 22? 1779] A SLOOP named the Active, (1) of which John Underwood was the Master, bound for New York, with a cargo of rum, &c. owned and laden in the island of Jamaica, was in the month Of (2) last met, near the coast of New-Jersey, by Captain Houston, in the brigantine Convention, an armed vessel belonging to the state of Pennsylvania. Four of her mariners, natives and inhabitants of New-England, who had fallen into the enemy's power in the West Indies, were taken on board this vessel for the purpose of navigating her to New-York, had risen some time before on the Master, and shut him, his mate and passengers, fast in the cabbin, by heaping a cable and other incumbrances over the stairway between the deck and the cabbin. This produced a controversy truly hostile, the prisoners below, who possessed the stock of victuals, water and ammunition, firing pistols through such openings as they were able; and the insurgents upon deck, directing two three pound cannon, for which they had a few cartridges, towards the cabbin; but with little effect on either part. Mean while, Capt. Underwood, highly incensed at their attempt to take his vessel from him, entertained the desperate idea of blowing up the quarterdeck with gunpowder, from which, by the prudence and persuasions of his passengers, he was restrained, till a proposal of a less dangerous nature should be essayed. This was the wedging of the rudder. Under this embarrasment, the sloop was disabled, and could not be steered. Whereupon, a truce took place between the contending parties, and an agreement was made, that the rudder should be loosed, till the men upon deck, who dreaded further imprisonment in New-York, might conduct the vessel towards the land, and when near enough, go off in the boat, leaving the rest of the people on board in possession of her. This accommodation being accordingly adjusted, had been so far proceeded on, that the land being near, Captain Underwood was expecting his enemy on deck immediately to quit the vessel, when Captain Houston approached, and put an  APRIL 22, 1779  end to the war on board, by seizing the Active and sending her for Philadelphia.  A libel was soon after exhibited in the Court by Admiralty by Capt. Houston, praying that the sloop and cargo might be adjudged to him, his officers, seamen, and the state, as their lawful prize. Against this, Gideon Umpsted [Olmsted] and the three other insurgents, opposed their claim, suing for the prize, as having been subdued and overcome by them. To determine the controversy, a struck jury, on the motion of the claimants, was directed, and the facts tried in the fairest manner; the result of which was a verdict, by which three-quarters of the prize was given to the Convention and the Gerard privateer, her consort, and in sight at the time of the seizure, and one-quarter to the claimants; who, dissatisfied with the decree of the Judge, in concurrence with the verdict, appealed. The Committee of Congress, who sit upon these appeals, on considering the evidence and hearing the advocates of the parties, not only reversed the sentence of the Court below, but made a new adjudication, awarding the whole to Gideon Umpsted, &c. the claimants, and directed the Judge of Admiralty to order their decree to be executed. This he declined to do, alledging that the act of Assembly of this state, under which he proceeded, had forbid all reexamination or appeal from facts found by a jury, and the verdict, of course, standing in full force, he could not execute a judgment contradictory to it.  To understand this, it is proper to take notice, that on the 25th of November, 1775, Congress recommended to the several colonies in union, now states, to erect courts for determining concerning captures at sea; and for this purpose \""to provide that all trial in such cases be had by a jury.\"" Accordingly the Legislature of Pennsylvania adopted the mode of proceeding thus sketched out, so that the facts, as at common law, should be heard and established by a jury, but allowed of an appeal on matter of law; in perfect coincidence with the nature of a jury trial, and strictly agreeing with the resolve of Congress of November, 1775, the only one, upon the subject, made by Congress. Now, if any legal controversy was ever suitable for the discussion of twelve men, surely it was this of the sloop Active; a mere question of fact; and the verdict is accordingly confined to fact strictly. If Judge Blackstone's opinion is looked for, he, upon trial by jury, says, \""that there is no method of reversing an error in the determination of facts, but by an attaint; or a new trial, to correct the mistakes of a former verdict.\"" 3d Vol. 406. (3) Yet, because the Court of Appeals, inattentive to our act of Assembly, the sole ground of their jurisdiction, have exceeded their proper limits, and judged in a matter which lay not before them, Pennsylvania is urged as a transgressor, to open a way to the operation of this unauthorized decree, and at the same time satisfy the lawful demands of the libellants. But the state, being not in fault, can not, consistently with justice to herself, submit to this unfounded demand. Especially, whilst the states of Massachusetts and New Hampshire, have laws for judging of maritime captures in full force, which permit no appeal to  Congress, except for prizes taken by the ships belonging to the United States. These states have, in this instance, considered the resolve of Congress in its true light, as advisory, and done as they saw best.  But we are told, that it is proper that Congress should have an appeal on those matters both in law and fact. Perhaps it may be so. It is likely the civilized world would be better satisfied with such a course of proceeding; but then the trial of the original capture should be by witnesses and not by jury, which admits of the full appeal desired. The claims of our own people, however, for shares or distribution, concern not foreigners, and may continue as heretofore; and such is the case of the sloop Active. However, if any new regulations are needed, before the consideration shall be enforced by the accession of the state of Maryland, the only hesitating state in union, let them be devised and recommended to the several communities. These cannot, in the nature of things, look backward, or take in cases, for which the laws in being have provided.  Again, it is alledged for this jurisdiction in Congress, that persons from different states may have controversies upon these points, and that an impartial body, like Congress, will be necessary to decide between them. But this would equally prove the necessity of a Court of Appeals in debt, real actions, and all other civil suits; nay, in criminal too, to secure justice to the people of one state, who may have debates about property, or may be charged with offences in another; an idea not entertained, as yet, as I have heard.  Lastly, it is supposed, that this claim is supported by the law of nations. Not to mention, that when the resolves of November, 1775, were made, no pretentions to national character were yet set up; it is observable, that the band of national union, the Confederation, is not yet agreed to by all, nor binding on any. Besides, a General Court of Appeals in the hands of the Supreme Power of the nation, is not, perhaps, a dictate of the law of nations, but rather the creature of treaties between the Maritime Powers of Europe. At least Blackstone, and Lee in his Treatise upon Captures,(4) say, that the Privy Council in Britain decide ultimately in prize causes, in pursuance of treaties.  After stating this controversy, I shall add, that it is now proposed, in order to support the honour of Congress in this business, that the Treasurer of the United States be authorized to pay the appealants a sum equal to the product of the sloop Active and her cargo, to be charged to the state of Pennsylvania, unless cause be shewn, &c.(5) Against this Pennsylvania will protest; nor will the difficulty end here. Should it be done, the like reimbursement will be due to Capt. Hugh McCulloch of this state, late of this city, for a ship and cargo of sugar, condemned at Boston; the appeal to Congress, which he earnestly sought here and in New-England, being denied him. Others too, in like cases, will ask like recompence; particularly, those whose vessels may hereafter be brought into Philadelphia under seizure, as the offensive act of Assembly continues in force.   It may be asked, whether this extreme nicety of character is either proper or safe, when assumed by Congress, for the Body, but much more for a Committee. The several states will doubtless have, from time to time, debates with the General Council of the nation. Now, it will be a very dangerous idea, that when Congress contend mistakingly for any point, that for the sake of the dignity of that Supreme Assembly, the state affected must recede from her right. I have hoped that these extravagant positions, which suit admirably well with the superstitious and slavish reverence paid to Princes, would be left with the Europeans. I call for no formal acknowledgments of error; but I should think it no derogation from Congress to forbear proceeding in a wrong path, when convinced of mistake. In the reign of George the First of England, an interested suitor carried an appeal from Ireland to Westminster. The British House of Lords catched at the opportunity of enlarging their authority, and voted that the decree of the Irish Lords, in this case, was void, as made without jurisdiction. Suppose the Commons of Ireland, as they ought, had impeached the Barons of their Exchequer for taking notice of and executing the judgment of a foreign jurisdiction; and that these Judges fixed in premunire,(6) had been subdued, and the decree of the Irish Peers executed, what would have become of British dignity? This ought to have been done. But the corrupt Commons of Ireland were managed, and the national rights sacrificed to the ambition and character of the Nobles of Britain. The Delegates of New-York must recollect the noble stand made by the Judges of the Supreme Court in the late province, in the case of Forsey and Cunningham, when a designing Governor, in a Court of Appeal, attempted to examine the verdict of a jury; a parallel case with the present; and the event of it, to wit, that his masters in England, who doubtless wished that he might succeed, ashamed of the futile claim, ordered it to be dropped. Douglas tells us, (7) that after the King and Council of Britain, determined in Mr. Winthorp's case, who appealed, when no appeal lay, that the judgment from England, declaring against the law of Connecticut for dividing inheritances, was disregarded in America, and the appeal to his Majesty still denied.  I shall leave the subject with mentioning the fatal consequence of the conduct of the British Legislature, in declaring, by act, their power over North-America in all cases whatsoever, consequently in taxing, passed, to save their honour, on repealing the Stamp act. What has become of violated dignity in this case? The people abroad suspect, that all this ado is not, however, made to repair the supposed contempt, nor yet to do justice to Gideon Umpsted and his fellows, but for the benefit of the managers of the puppets. It is thought too much for the same men to sustain the characters of Advocates, Judges, and perhaps_________in this business, An AMERICAN  MS not found; reprinted from the Pennsylvania Packet, or thc General Advertiser, April 22, 1779.

  Sir, April 22. 1779 The publication you refer to surprized me not a little, having never before had the least intimation that the examination of Capt. Folger was missing. (1) Mr Paine I knew had no access to the office, & no member of Congress had applied to me for it, since some time in January last, just before the appointment of the comee. on foreign affairs when Mr Lovel enquired for it & having read it delivered it to me again and I laid it on the top of a case in the office apart from other papers with orders that it should be put in its place. I was therefore surprized if the paper was missing that no application had been made to me.  Upon reading the paragraph in the publication, I went immediately into the office to enquire into the truth of the assertion, and know who had applied for the paper, when I was informed by the clerks in the office that Mr Laurens had asked for it about three weeks ago & that it could not then be found; that they had since searched for it, but to no effect. I desired them to continue their search & try to recollect if any other had enquired for it, or if any member had taken it out. Yesterday I went into the office to enquire further, when Col. Lovel who happened to be there looking into the apartment allotted to it found the examination said to be missing with the papers therein referred to all wrapped up in one bundle in the same manner they were when I laid them on the top of the case in January. So that I am happy to inform you that the papers are ready for any member who wishes to examine them. I am, Sir, your obedient humble Servt, Chas Thomson, Secy  ""

  My dear Sir, Philadelphia April 24th 1779 To such uncertain issue are all letters now exposed that are committed to Ship board, that it absolutely prohibits that full and explicit declaration of ones sentiments on many important points which I shall ever wish to make to you on whose wisdom and goodness I have the firmest reliance. The principles you adopt, and the conduct you intend to pursue, as mentioned in the letter you did me the honor to write me the 5 of Augt. last, I do most thoroughly approve. I know well that your support will only be given to the cause of virtue and your country, and that it will never be withheld therefrom. Who fails in doing right, fails nobly because Virtue is its own and a very great reward. You will see by the public prints, which Mr. Lovell tells me he has transmitted since the 1st of December last, that we are not exempt from the common Lot of humanity. But, tho Deanes and Partners of Deanes may and will shoot up in every Soil, and the foulness about them thicken for a time the purest streams, these will at length work themselves clear and as they run refine. The bold and sudden attempt made by Deane's Libel of Decr. 5 on the public mind, seized it for a time with great violence, and hurried it away with too much rapidity for reflection. But no sooner did men begin to think than they began to see, and S. Deane has now fallen under universal contempt and censure. I am sure it has not been this Mans fault if he hath not done more injury to these States than G. Howe ever did. But enough of him. We shall soon transmit our plan for foreign affairs, and in the mean time, we are very impatient to hear from you, not having done so for three months past. We hope Spain will join France, which will indeed make decisive work. We are preparing for the ensuing Campaign with all possible vigor, but the enemies and our troops yet remain in quarters this way, and it seems probable that the former will be glad to continue so all the Summer as they have not more than 10 or 12,000 men both in York & Rhode Island, which force, if collected, would not be sufficient to take the field. The enemy have made a successful impression on Georgia this winter, but I APRIL 24, 1779  consider this in the same light of mere temporary effect, as we have seen all their former operations. Measures are taking to remove them from that State, and tho the Climate wars against us, it will not fight for them. I see, with you, the importance of the Confederation, and I am not without hope that it will eer long, be completed. All have agreed except Maryland, and that State it is thought will come in at the next meeting of their Assembly, which will be in a few months. The Assembly of Virginia have directed their Delegates to move Congress to fix a day for closing this great Compact between such of the States as have consented, allowing either a given or indefinite time, as to Congress shall seem best, for dissenting States to become Members. We shall shortly move Congress for this purpose (1) The Currency is an object of the last importance. Tax we do, and very largely indeed, but this is still inadequate. Some aid, by foreign Loans, is indispensable by way of absorbing the immensity of the Mass. Two Millions of pounds sterling applied this way would, with the aid of Taxes, so restore us As to put the remainder of our Money on a good foundation, and then, Taxation with economy will do the rest.(2)  Lately our Coasts have been pretty free from the enemies Cruisers. They have now an ample call for their Sea force in other ports, and at present our frigates preserve our trade from the interruption it met with by the numerous small Privateers of the enemy.  Be pleased to accept a pamphlet that accompanies this containing a special collection from our Journals made to counteract certain false and ill designed assertions of the British Commissioners lately here.(3)  I am, yours dear Sir with the most affectionate esteem and regard, Richard Henry Lee  [P.S.] Direct your letters for me to the care of Dr. Shippen in Philadelphia.

  Mr. Dunlap. [ca. April 25, 1779](1) Several Pieces in your Paper(2) having reflected upon my Reputation you will do me the Favor of inserting this. That I have taken no Notice of them hitherto and take Notice of them now requires an Explanation. I neglected them because I supposed myself superior to them and I supposed so because I felt a Consciousness that I merited Something different from Detraction. I now write because some Friends whom I value at a Distance from the present Scene or otherwise not well informed draw odious Conclusions from my Silence.  It is not my Object to inveigh against any Man. Every free Citizen hath a Right to think, speak and write freely of public Measures and of public Men. As I feel no one Spark of Resentment I shall cast no one Reflection. I am vain enough to believe that I could convey a Pang to the Bosoms of those who have stimulated Publications agt me. But satyrical Remarks can do no Good (to the Public) & therefore I shall avoid them.  I applaud the Zeal of those Gentlemen who laudably endeavor to bring bad Men and bad Measures to Light. They will however pardon me for holding & declaring an Opinion that Charges not well founded in incontestible Facts are injurious to the Public. They weaken such as may be afterwards made on better Ground and by lessening the Confidence of the People frequently defeat the most salutary Efforts. If I have done Evil let the Consequences of Guilt overtake me. If not all I ask is that in future & with Respect to others a Life devoted to the Service of Mankind & the voluntary Sacrifice of Time, Ease and health in public Cares may induce so much Charity as to believe that a Difference in Opinion upon Subjects of great Magnitude does not imply a Guiltiness of Intention & That self Interest is not always the Spring of human Conduct.  I have not much Time that I can call my own nor have I a Right to intrude upon the Patience of others. Brevity on the present Occasion APRIL 25, 1779  therefore becomes as necessary as it is proper on all Occasions. I am charged with having remarkably distinguished myself in preventing Information from coming to Congress (20 April).(3) Many others are involved with me on this Occasion. I am not conscious of this, I believe it will be difficult to point out an Instance. When Information was given relative to some Transactions of Mr Robert Morris I urged an Enquiry, I pledged myself to be his Prosecutor if he was guilty. I believed him innocent and the Event hath shewn that Innocence. I could name other Instances but as my Friendship for this Gentleman hath been mentioned on some former Occasions this will be allowed to be unexceptionable.  It hath been said (2 March)(4) that my favorite Objects are to disgrace Pensilvania, insult the President of its Council and to support Genl. Arnold. I do not remember a single Act of my Life which had a Tendency to disgrace Pensilvania neither do I conceive it possible for an Individual to bring Disgrace upon a Country which he holds no Office in and does not even belong to. While Pensilvania perseveres in a wise & manly Conduct she may be subdued perhaps but she cannot be disgraced and an Attempt to do it by an Individual would savor of Insanity. As to insulting the Presidt. of this State I can only say that it is not in my Disposition or Education to insult and that I am by no Means conscious of it in the present Instance neither do I beleive that the Presidt. himself is of the same opinion with the Writer who hath made this Charge. To have supported Genl. Arnold or any other Person cannot be criminal unless he is guilty and his Guilt known to his Supporters. But more of this hereafter.  ""

  Sir, Phila. 25th April 1779. I was honored with your Excellency's Favor of the 16th late on Sunday Evening last. (1) Since that Period I have been so occupied with indispensible public Affairs that I have not been able to answer it. I hope you will excuse a Delay which by no Means proceeded from Inattention.  You express a Wish to know whether my Letter(2) was public or private. As it was my Design to render it agreable I pray you to consider it in which ever Light you shall think proper.  As you hold up the Idea that your Conduct on the Conference was that of a public Man I have nothing more to say with Relation to it but must lament in Silence my Misfortune.  Your Information of my Conduct in and out of Congress leads it seems to a Conclusion that I harbor hostile Sentiments to your Government and pursue a Line of Opposition to you. I believe your Information is not so good as you suppose. Mentioning out of Congress Matters which pass in it tending to irritate shews a Disposition in the Relator which renders many Allowances necessary for a candid Interpretation. I did indeed as a Delegate reprobate those Proceedings of your Council which in my Opinion reflected upon Congress; but even this would have been done with more Temperance if I had not been stimulated by Attempts to prevent it under the Pain of personal Danger. As for the Rest I still think as I always did that in your State and every other the Government as a Government is to be supported that the Form and the Administrators of it depend on the People and that Congress ought not to interfere either one Way or the other.  My Conduct out of Congress has been much misrepresented and I could give you Instances to contradict the Conclusions you have drawn but this is not the Season nor are you perhaps in the Temper to receive them.  Clearly you have misunderstood what I said with Respect to the Personalities in Arnold's Case. Many Reasons will suggest themselves to you upon Consideration to shew sufficient Ground for the Hint without touching you and to remove from me the Imputation of a Versatility of Conduct which you have charged me with.  Whoever hath asserted that I encouraged Genl. Arnold and those about him to insult your State was either misinformed himself or meant to deceive you. The direct contrary is true. The Mischief was done before I knew a Syllable of the Matter. Afterwards I advised Concession and Apology tho I did not think myself authorized to compel them.  You say that you have incurred Censure for parting with Wilkins's Letter. (3) To gratify the good Wishes of those who can censure one Gentleman for sending another his Letters I return that in Question. Permit me at the same Time to express my Acknowlegement for the Sacrifices you made on that Occasion. APRIL 25, 1779  That my Enmity or Friendship are indifferent to you I can easily beleive because I have a juster Sense of my own Insignificance than the World are willing to allow me. I wish to be at Peace with all Mankind and am far from insensible to Enmities which I have not merited tho I feel a thorough Contempt for Detraction.  With all due Respect, I have the Honor to be, your Excellency's most obedient & humble Servant, Gouv Morris  ""

  Dear Sir Philadelphia 26 April 1779 The Questions contained in your Favor of the Day of April Inst.(1) are as important, as the Manner of introducing them is delicate.  While the maritime Affairs of the Continent continue under the Direction of a Committee, they will be exposed to all the Consequences of Want of System, Attention and Knowledge. The marine Committee consists of a Delegate from each State. It fluctuates-New Members constantly coming in and old ones going out. Three or four indeed have remained in it  APRIL 26, 1779  from the Beginning, & have a proportionate Influence, or more properly Interest in it. Very few of the Members understand even the State of our naval Affairs or have Time or Inclination to attend to them. But why is not this System changed? It is in my opinion convenient to the Family Compact.(2) The commercial Committee is equally useless. A Proposition was made to appoint a commercial Agent for the States under certain Regulations. Opposition was made. The ostensible Reasons were various. The true Reason was its interference with a certain commercial Agent in Europe, and his Connections.  You will if I mistake not find Mr. Gerard disposed to be open and communicative. (3) He has acquired an extensive Knowledge of our Affairs. I have no Reason to believe he will use it to our Prejudice. There is as much Intrigue in this State House as in the Vatican, but as little Secrecy as in a boarding School. It mortifies me on this Occasion to reflect that the Rules of Congress on the Subject of Secrecy which are far too general and perhaps for that Reason more frequently violated, restrain me from saying twenty things to you which have ceased to be private.  The State of our Currency is really serious. When or by what Means the Progress of the Depreciation will be prevented is uncertain. The Subject is delicate, but the Conduct of some Men really indicates at least great Indifference about it. It will not be many Days before Measures having a great tho not immediate Influence on this Subject will be either adopted or rejected. I shall then have an opportunity of being more particular.  I am my dear Sir with perfect Esteem & Regard, Your most obt Servant, John Jay.  ""

  Sir, Philadelphia April 26th. 1779.  The repeated Accounts which are brought to us concerning the Want of Bread in Massachusetts Bay have induced us to promote the Business on which Mr. Dugan was sent by the Board of War, so far as to put into his Hands the remaining Part of the Money which we obtained from Congress on the 5th of this Month.(1) He represented to us that he was at a Stand in his Purchases for Want of current Money, and that his Prospects of obtaining Flour were now good. It was really on the Score of his Representation of the Unserviceableness of the Notes which he brought from Boston that we obtained the Grant from Congress, and we hope that our Afterproceedings will not disappoint any Views of the honorable Assembly which may have originated from the Information we gave of the Money in the Treasury here being liable to their Order. We have thought that we were conducting for the best, under a Pressure of several Necessities.  We are much rejoyced at the News which is brought this Morning by Captain Palmes.(2) It is great in every View, and in particular it affords Relief to our Minds under Anxiety about the Scarcity of Bread in Boston and other Parts of the State which we have the Honor to represent.

  Dr Genl. Philaa. 26th April 1779. You must permit me most heartily to congratulate you upon the very important Intelligence which Monsr. Gerard will confidentially communicate to you. It is and indeed ought to be a Secret even from Congress for which I need give you no Reasons as you are but too well acquainted with them.(1) Measures have already been taken for obtaining the necessary Supplies which the Minister will detail to you. These you will undoubtedly assist as far as may fall within your Line. When the Enemy went to the Southern States I considered it as a Kind of Madness and I think they will feel the Consequences but certainly it cannot be worth while to loose a Moment unnecessarily in that Quarter for the Climate will fight for us during the Summer and what shall remain may be compleated in the Autumn if the other Objects succeed.  The first then should be to bring on a considerable Quantity of Rice which together with Flour from the middle States must be transmitted Eastward for the Ulterior Operations. To accomplish N.Y. perhaps the Western Detachments may be useful as a Feint but will it not be still more effectual to risque almost a Retreat in Case of Attack by detaching to Albany as if in Prosecution of an Expedition to Canada, calling upon Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey for a Body of Militia to answer the immediate Purpose of protecting the Country and the remote Purpose of more Consequence. This would probably lull the Enemy into Security and false Intelligence might be superadded to deceive them. In a few Days the Force nevertheless could be collected from Fort Edward and the Mohawk River to Albany brought down to the Highlands by Water and cooperate &ca. A Part with the Militia of Connecticut and New York might alarm the Enemy at Fort Kniphausen and make the necessary Preparations to throw a Bridge over the River at Haerlem. The main Body by possessing themselves the Landing opposite to Greenwich might at a proper Opportunity be thrown across. The Jersey Militia would keep Staten Island in Alarm and secure the Posts in the Rear. The other Troops might be landed to attack as the Enemy landed to attack you. This with a Fire upon the Town would in all human Probability effect the Purpose. That Point gained Rhode Island would be an easy Acquisition APRIL 26, 1779  as the whole Force might then be turned to that Object and then the great End would follow in it's Course. The Magnitude and Importance of Things like these speak for themselves. (2) The Practicability will I think be made evident when the Means are considered. You will see the Necessity of opening yourself fully to Mr Gerard upon your Designs & taking with him all proper Measures. Cattle Carriages for heavy Artillery and the like should be assembled at Portsmouth or some such convenient Place. You will have the Advantage on this Occasion at least to be sure of your Secrets and indeed such Steps may be taken that in the Ignorance of the Enemy as to the State and probable State of Things in the West Indias it will be impossible for them to develop the Combination of Incidents so distinct as those which may be necessary at once to fulfill the Objects in View and blind them.  Excuse the Length & Tediousness of this Letter and beleive me with all the Sincerity of private Friendship superadded to publick Esteem, affectionately, your Friend & humble Servant, Gouv Morris  ""

I have for this Reason, with the approbation of my Colleagues, transmitted your Excellency's Letter and the Enclosures to the Commander in Chief, and requested him to correspond with you on the Subject: & I have no doubt but he will do every thing you wish or recommend.(2)  I congratulate your Excellency on the important Success of our little Squadron; it is a Seasonable Supply for us, & will distress our Enemies. Favourable Reports prevail respecting the Operations to the Southward but they are not sufficiently authenticated to deserve a detail of particulars.  The Extravegance of living here is beyond description and the Burthen of publick business, intollerable.

It is now become highly necessary that we should have these Accounts, therefore we request Gentlemen that you will give Orders to the Agents immediately to make them up fully and clearly and send them to us as soon as possible as we have already been much embarrassed for want of them.

The Ship Reprizal being unfortunately lost returning to America, we have frequent application made to us for pay & Prize Money by the representatives of her Crew which from the want of accounts we are unable to satisfy, the Cutter Revenge commanded by Captain Conyngham is arrived here, and is partly claimed by private persons, we are equally at a loss for want of her accounts and the many Prizes she took in the European Seas.

You are hereby directed to purchase the Prize Ship Jason of 20 Guns & the Prize Schooner Hibernia provided on Survey they are found to be suitable Vessels for the Navy. If they are purchased you will prepare them to sail with the other Vessels. We have had reason to beleive that the frigate Confederacy would have been ready and at sea some months ago, which not being the Case we desire you will inform yourselves immediately of the cause of her detention and as it is of great and immediate importance to the Public that She be immediately got to Sea, if in your Opinion that purpose will be more speedily effected by giving Captain Saltonstal the command of her, we desire you will do so, and immediately thereafter cause a Court of Inquiry to examine into the conduct of Captain Harding. (2) We request you will send forward to us with all despatch properly adjusted compleat accounts of the Prizes taken by the frigate Deane on her late cruize. That vessel is now in this River and her Crew will expect to receive their share of Prize Money before they reenter therefore it is of much importance that we be speedily furnished with the necessary Papers to enable us to make distribution amongst them. Captain Nicholson writes to his Agent Mr Mathias Brimmer to pay the proceeds into your hands, and you can draw upon us for the amount. We beg this business may be finished with all despatch.  The Number of Marine officers now in Commission we consider are more than is consistent with that economy which Should be Observed in all our public Affairs-and as a new System is now forming for the regulation of the Navy Department, we do not desire to have any new officers of that kind apointed.  As the One twentieth part of Prize Money alloted for the commander in chief by the Regulations of Congress concerning the distribution of Prizes, was under the Idea of such an Officer being at the head of the Fleet; but as at present there is no such Officer, It is our deterrnination that the Said twentieth part be distributed Amongst the Officers and Crews of the Ships at large, which you will please to make known to the Agents in your department.

  Sir Phila. 27th April 1779 The great demand for Flour requires undoubtedly very great Exertions and therefore I am to advise in the first place very rigid Oeconomy in the Expenditures of that scarce Article Secondly I presume that what you had to the Eastward what hath been carried in there and what may be spared from New York will if well husbanded last untill the 1st of July for if there be a Sufficiency untill the 1st of May from the other Sources 1500 Barrels of the Prize Flour will contain at least 300,000 Rations which for 5,000 Men will last 60 days. Allowing the consumption of the Grand Army to be 2000 Barrels per Month then from the 1st of April to the 1st of October which is 6 Months will require 12000 Barrels, A delivery of 3000 in April and about 3,000 on hand leaves only 6000 which may certainly be procured in the City of Philadelphia if Purchases be stopt elsewhere, You will therefore Order all the purchasers to the Southward of the Delaware instantly to desist except those who may be employed in laying up Magazines to the Westward who ought also to desist when the Magazines are compleated and you are to assign as a reason that the State of the Magazines is such as to render their Efforts unnecessary. What may be in Jersey is not counted upon tho certainly all that can be had should be procured APRIL 27, 1779  there but at Philadelphia about 11,000 should be procured so as to leave an Overplus of 5,000 in case of untoward Accidents.

  My dear Friend Philade April 29. 1779 I have not yet acknowledgd your Favors of the 14th & 15th of March. (1) The Subject of the former is of the last Importance. I have always been of Opinion that America would be in more Danger in the Point of coming to an Accommodation with Great Britain than in any Stage of the War. Unpracticd as we are in the Business of Treaties and perhaps too unsuspecting of the Intrigues of Courts, we may be led into Conventions which may put us into a State of insecurity while we are nominally independent. APRIL 29, 1779  The Advice which some Persons would affect to give us not to insist upon too much, should be receivd with the greatest Caution. What do they mean by it, and how far wd they have us extend it? If we had hearkened to such Advice in the Infancy of this Contest, we should have submitted to Britain the Right of taxing us, & humbly supplicated her to suspend the Exercise of it. In doing this we might have prevented the Horrors of War, & have been her quiet Slaves. No Terms have yet been proposd by Britain. She possibly may offer them soon, and her proposals probably may be insidious & inadmissible. I do believe she is at this Moment employing her secret Emissaries to find out the Disposition of America & what would be her Ultimatum. Should not the People then speak the Language which becomes them & assure her that after so virtuous & successful a Struggle they are determind to demand enough for the Purpose of securing their own internal & external Happiness. This is the Aim of the Revolution and the Extent of the Wishes of our good & great Ally, who I dare affirm, is invariably determind not to Seperate his Interest from that of America, & to support the Cause of the United States as his own. Our Happiness depends upon Independence. To be prosperous we must have an extensive Trade. This will require a respectable Navy. Our Ships must be mannd, and the Source of Seamen is the Fishery. Among those who ought to see the Importance of the Fishery, I am affraid there are some who think that in insisting upon that we should insist upon too much.(2) Nova Scotia & Canada would be a great & permanent Protection to the Fishery. But these, say some, are not Parts of the United States, and what Right should we have to claim them? The Cession of those Territories would prevent any Views of Britain to disturb our Peace in future & cut off a Source of corrupt British Influence, which issuing from them, might diffuse Mischiefe and Poison thro the States. Will not then the Possession of Nova Scotia & Canada be necessary, if we mean to make Peace upon pacifick Principles? If we are to have no overtures this year, and Providence blesses us with the Spirit of Enterprize, Would it not be better for us, provided it be practicable, to wrest those Places from the Hands of the Enemy than trust to the Uncertainty of Treaty? I confess we have a Choice of Difficulties. I pray God we may surmount them all! None however reach the Pinnacle of Eminence & Glory but the virtuous & brave. Adieu my dear Sir. I hope to see & live with you shortly; but I shall expect another Letter from you before I leave this Place.(3)  ""

  Sir, Trenton, April 29th, 1779. Agreeable to the appointment of the Legislature, I repaired to Philadelphia in the month of January last, and have since that time attended Congress, until the public business entrusted to my care in the county of Somerset rendered my absence unavoidable.  It is needless for me to remind the honorable Legislature, that I did with great reluctance accept of the appointment of a delegate for this state in Congress. I was then sufficiently sensible that the trust was too important for my years and abilities. I am now fully convinced that I should do injustice to my country did I not decline that service.  In doing this, I am conscious to myself that I am actuated merely by motives for the public good, well knowing that whatever may be my abilities, they will be useless to the state in the supreme council of the Nation, and that the other appointments with which the Legislature of New Jersey have been pleased to honor me in the county of Somerset, are more than sufficient to employ my whole attention.  I might add some other circumstances which render my situation there peculiarly disagreeable, but I fear the evils which might arise from my opening myself on this subject, would more than counterbalance any good APRIL 29, 1779  it it might probably answer. I trust, however, the representatives of New Jersey will not think it impertinent in one who has faithfully endeavored to serve his country, to declare to them that the interests of America loudly call on them for extraordinary vigilance.  I shall say nothing respecting the amazing expense of attending Congress, and my inability to support it. I am determined not to complain till the last farthing of my little property is spent in the service of my country; and then, perhaps, I shall have the consolation to see poverty esteemed as the characteristic of an honest rnan.  I conclude with observing, I am particularly moved to wish for a release from the appointment, as it has been hinted to me that my colleague Mr. Fell is exceedingly uneasy that he is so often left alone to manage the weighty affairs of state, and that he has even expressed himself with warmth and temper on the subject in his letters to the Legislature.

  Thursday 29th April [1779] \""Resolved therefore that these United States be called upon in addition to the Sum required by Resolution of Congress of the 2nd January last for their respective quotas of Million of Dollars to be paid into the Continental Treasury before the 1st Jany. next.\""(1)  APRIL 29, 1779  Motions were made for filling the blank 1st with fifteen, 2d Eighteen, 3d Thirty. The question to be put on the highest Sum.  I rose & said Sir, the largest Sum is to be put to question first, it is a very large Sum-I perceive I have no Colleague present & I think it necessary to consult my Colleague before I give my voice for taxing my Constituents so heavily as their quota of 30 [Millions] will be. I will not take an advantage of my Colleague by calling for the Yeas & Nays in his absence. I shall therefore move in right of a State for postponing the determination of this question, unless the House will agree to postpone the question more generally.  Having seen my Colleague a little time before take his Hat & Cane, I apprehended he had gone home, but it appeared he was only in the Library Room-where he presently informed by J.p. (2) Of what had passed-he came in & sat by me, I repeated what I had said-he replyed I leave that matter entirely to you, & shall aquiesce in whatever you determine, you know I dont understand these matters so well as you do- then retired again to the Library. I rose again & addressed the Chair, Sir, I have had some conference with my Colleague on the business before us, he is pleased to do me the honor of leaving the matter wholly to me, & as it is a subject of great importance, & the transaction devolved upon myself, I find it incumbent on me to deliberate & to take time for reflection, more especially when I consider the present circumstances of my Country. I could for these reasons wish the further consideration of this article may be postponed-it is near our time for adjourning, we may fill up the remainder by reading Public Letters & giving away a few Millions under the Reports of the Board of Treasury.  The consideration Postponed, & the House Adjourned.(3)  ""

  Sir, Philada. April 29th. 1779 As the Books & Papers of the Comtee. of foreign affairs remain on the Table of Congress to be used in the public Deliberations which still con- APRIL 29, 1779  tinue upon a fruitful Subject begun last September you do not at this Time receive any official Letter from that Committee. But I will not omit the good opportunity by Mr. Smith,(1) Son of the Commissioner of the Loan Office here, to assure you individually of my Regards. I hope you have long before now received yr Credentials as minister Plenipotentiary from the United States. There was a dissagreable Lentor, in the public Proceedings at first, and in the sending forward yr Testimonials afterwards. From this Source it is, I suppose, that confidential Communications have not been made to you by the french Court, so as to furnish matter for yr Dispatches to Congress; while such have been made to us in another Channel. Sir, it behoves you much to let yr. Constituents hear often from you, lest it shd. be fully credited among us that there is but one Man (2) in the Universe that can be pleasing to the Court of France as a Minister from hence. The Recall of Mr. Deane has given Birth to very singular Writings and Measures. You have escaped all considerable Injuries, tho you have been comprehended in some Propositions not altogether honorary, as you will shortly see by the Journals which are to be printed weekly. I ought, however, now, to give you the Satisfaction of knowing that the Question about yr Recall was only a Kind of necessary Consequence flowing from the Adoption of a Fact on which to found a Principle that might destroy the Commissions of Messrs. Lees & Izard particularly Mr. A Lee's.  In my Opinion the improper triplicate Appointment for the Court of France produced, in very natural Consequence, \""Suspicions & Animosities\"". But these Evils ought not to be made Reasons for depriving the public of the Services of Men whose great Abilities, Integrity & Industry may be exerted in distinct Trusts without the like future Inconveniences.  Disappointed Views have generated an Implacability against the falsely supposed Cause of that Disappointment. Nothing short of the Ruin of the Reputation of Arthur Lee will glut the Malice of a party formed against him by that Spirit of assassinating Innuendo which so eminently governs his Arch Enemy.  I expect to be able in a few days to communicate to you the Decision of Congress in Regard to the other Gentlemen, and some particular Instructions for your own Government. I refer you to the Gazettes for a general State of military Proceedings, and to common Fame for the ill Condition of our Currency.  I am, Sir, your most humble Servt. James Lovell  P.S. Sepr. 17.

  [April 30, 1779.] On the 30th April Mr. Paca observed that Congress had agreed to receive such information respecting our Commissioners as any member might have to offer & had called upon the Members to give in information-that he had in his hand important information respecting the character of the Honorable A Lee Esquire & desired the House to receive it, after much debate the Paper was read and laid on the Table.(1) It was remarked that the consideration of that Paper (Signed Willm. Paca, Willm Hy Drayton) could not take place immediately, because the order of the day was, \""to proceed upon the report of the Committee of 13 on foreign affairs immediately after reading the Journals,\""(2) & that until we had entered upon that business no question but for committing or postponing could be put. That when we had entered upon it, the Gentn. might with propriety call for the reading their information as apposite to the subject. After various opinions had been delivered in tedious debates, it was agreed to proceed upon the Report. The President said \""the Question before you Gentn. is whether you will recall Mr. Lee.\"" Mr. Laurens replied, \""No Mr. President, the question is, whether the Sieur Gerard shall be requested to give  APRIL 30, 1779  information upon the Motion made on Monday the 26th Inst. by the Honorable Mr. Paca, which had been under debate near two Hours when adjournment was called for & carried, what did we adjourn from?-surely from prosecuting the business then before us to another day, the day is now arrived, we must resume the consideration of that business.\"" The President acquiesed-Remarks were then made on the impropriety of the conduct of the Gentlemen who had now produced information from Mr. Gerard on a certain point, while a question was pending, whether such information should be applied for?  N.B.  Mr. Paca's motion was made on the 26th.(3) the House adjourned that day at l/2 p. 4 P M. Mr. Gerard went out of Town at 9 oC. A M the 27th.  The information therefore which Mr. Drayton and Mr. Paca had obtained from Mr. Gerard must have been delivered them between 1/2 p 4 Monday afternoon & 9. Tuesday Morning.  The Gentlemen, when they heard Mr. Laurens call for the adjourn'd motion on the 26th Moved for leave to withdraw the said adjourned motion, the House in general consented. Mr. Laurens objected & called for the Yeas & Nays. The President said, as not one whole State objected, the motion might be withdrawn, Mr. Laurens denied the doctrine, he said it could not be determined who objected until the House should be called over, that he had an indubitable right to the Yeas & Nays, which would bring the motion on the Book & that such measures, such extraordinary measures ought to appear to our Constituents. Mr. President made some little objection to the right of Yeas & Nays. Mr. Laurens, who was by no means surprized at the President's leanings, appealed to the Rules, & said nothing less than violence could deprive him of his right & that he trusted there would be no appearance of violence in that House. Mr. Duane rose & delivered a soft intriguing address, talked of leaving Congress, not because such infamous measures had been adopted & pursued respecting the application to the French Minister, but because, such measures were likely to be properly held up to public view. Mr. Laurens said since he saw Gentlemen were distressed, he was inclined to be good natured & would not insist upon the Yeas & Nays. The question was then simply put for leave to withdraw; Mr. Drayton's voice was heard in a Bravado, No. his sincerity may be determined by his first opinion for withdrawing & by the President's declaration that there was not one whole state against it. The Motion was withdrawn-a true Copy of it is however preserved, & accompanies this Memoire; Mr. Drayton who has been a very principal actor in these illicit practices with the french Minister.(4)  ""

  [April 30, 1779] The undersigned Members of the Congress of the United States of North-America, have the Honor to inform the said Congress:  That, upon good grounds having been led to believe, that the conduct of Arthur Lee Esqr. late, one of the Commissioners representing these United States at the Court of Versailles, & now, sole Commissioner to represent the said States at the Court of Madrid, was disgustful to those Courts, unconciliatory to their Subjects, & prejudicial to the honor & interest of the said States; they were astonished to hear an assertion made in Congress on the 15th Inst. by an honorable Member from Massachusetts-Bay, as from the highest authority in America, that the said Commissioner is possessed of the confidence of the Court of Versailles;(1) & since, another assertion, by another honorable Member, from the same State, that the said Commissioner is the most proper Person to represent the said States at the Court of Madrid: assertions, which being made in the debates upon foreign affairs, were made to influence Congress to continue the said Arthur Lee Esqr. as the Public Minister of the said United-States to the Court of Madrid, at the expected Negociations for a general pacification under the Mediation of that Court.  That, the undersigned, impressed with a conviction, that in such an important conjuncture, the Minister to represent the said States at the Court of Madrid, ought not to be disagreeable to that Court, nor to the Court of Versailles in faithful Alliance with these States; & that the interest of the said States demanded, that it should be precisely ascertained, whether or not, the said Commissioner was disagreeable to the said Courts; for certain information upon the point, they have, from the necessity of the case, been compelled to apply to the Minister Plenipotentiary of France, residing near Congress, as the highest source of information in America.  That, in consequence of such application, the Minister Plenipotentiary produced to the undersigned, an original letter to him from the Count de Vergennes, Minister for foreign affairs at the Court of Versailles, dated the 29th of October 1778;(2) in which, after having stated the intelligence, which has been communicated to Congress by the Minister Plenipotentiary, in February last; & after having assigned some reasons, for not having communicated that intelligence to the American Commissioners in Paris, the Count de Vergennes concludes in these terms-\""Je vous avouerai d'ailleurs que je crains M. Lee et ses entours\""-Besides, I confess to you, that I fear Mr. Lee, and those about him.  That, the Minister Plenipotentiary added, that this consideration induced the Court of Versailles, to keep secret from the said Commissioner, the intended sailing of the Count D'Estaing for America, until his Fleet  APRIL 30, 1779  was ready to put to Sea-that the said Commissioner, by his conduct on several occasions, created the highest disgust in the Court of Versailles against him-that the Court of Madrid, in the closest connection with that of Versailles, entertained the same sentiments respecting the said Commissioner, not only on account of his conduct on those occasions, but, because of his imprudent conduct in Spain-and, in a word, the Minister Plenipotentiary expressly declared, that he has every reason to think, that neither of those courts have that confidence in the said Commissioner, which, is necessary to give success to the Negociations of a Foreign Minister.  The undersigned having received such decisive information from the Minister of France, with liberty to communicate it to Congress, think it is their indispensable duty to the United States, & to themselves, to lay the same explicitly before this the Supreme Council of America; to the end, that they may not be misled to continue the said Commissioner as the Representative of these United-States at a Court, in the highest manner disgusted at his conduct, & at which, of consequence, his Negociations must be unsuccessful. But, if, unfortunately, it shall be disregarded, they will have the consolation to reflect, that in giving this information, they discharged their duty to the United-States; & that having given it, they cannot justly be held responsable for the consequences of a measure, but too likely to prove unconciliatory abroad, ruinous to the Public Finances at home, & an impediment to a speedy & honorable Pacification, securing the Independence of the United-States of North-America.(3)  Wm.

  Sir [April ? 1779](1) In a letter from a Mr Brakenridge to Mr Drayton,(2) I find my name mentioned as one Reported to have Some Interest in a Commercial Concern with Mr Deane the design and tendency whereof is supposed to be Injurious to the political Interests of America and that the Report Originated from you.(3) This last Circumstance, only, makes it of Consequence enough to engage my attention, for, so far as the public are Concerned in my Transactions, the Evidence relating them is clear and unequivocal, and easily to be found and I am at all times ready to Commit my self thereon to my Immediate Constituents to whom only I hold my self Judicially accountable, And as to my private acquaintance they know me too well to admit such a report to a ready Belief, at least without an Enquiry, for the Result of which I am under no Apprehensions. But while such a Report is Circulated under the Sanction of your Name, it becomes of Serious importance and I feel myself under an Indispensable Necessity of asking you whether You have expressed at any time an opinion, Conjecture or declaration which may have given rise to it?

  My Dear Sir, Philad. 1st May 1779. You may wish to know the Proceedings on your last Letter respecting your determination to resign.(1) They were concise. The President read your Letter among the other dispatches. I had not then mine from you on the same Subject: nor was I in Congress. Indeed not a member was apprized of it. On reading your Letter a motion was made to comply with your Request: It was seconded and passed without a single Remark or Dissent. Thus you have your wishes. I feel a strong temptation to expostulate with you on this Subject-but what End will it answer? My Views & Expectations which were honourable for yourself and important to my Country are disappointed: and I own, & feel, the Superiority of the Planet which governs you over my feeble Star. Here let it rest. It gives me, however, great Consolation that you can still be highly serviceable to your Country, even with respect to military Operations: and eminently so in the Cabinet: In the military by advice and private Exertions; In Council, by taking your Seat in this House to which you can now have no Objection. To retire to private Life, before the War is terminated, you cannot reconcile to your Reputation, or to your Feelings. It is needless to enlarge on a point so evident; & of which you are so good a Judge!  You know my Opinion of the necessity of appointing Commissioners in our State for managing our Affairs with the Six Nations: and securing Satisfaction for the Injuries we have suffered by their unpro[vo]ked Depredations. No other Way can be devised to awe them into Peace & justice; Than after having convincd them of our Superiority, to insist on a Cession MAY 1, 1779  of Territory adequate to the real Injuries they have done to us. This has been the Policy of the Southern States & it has been productive of the most salutary Effects.  But who to appoint to this Trust is a great Question? If it rested with Congress your Delegates woud probably have the Recommendation: If with our Council of Appointment, I can form no Conjecture: being a total Stranger to domestic Politics: It woud, however, be very hard indeed if your Advice in both Cases had not full Weight! Write to me explicitely on this Subject.  I have nothing material to add, nor time to spare, writing this in the Course of a Debate. Present my respectful Compliments to Mrs. Schuyler, the young Ladies, & the whole Circle of our Friends.  Adieu!

  Dear Sir, Phila. May 2d. 1779. Whatever appearances there may have been for peace, this Summer, they are in my Opinion vanished, and we must have another Campaign. On the part of the Enemy no doubt, it will be made as active as possible. Our General I hope & trust will put very little to risque. Had Congress determined with that precision which I think it ought to have done last February, in all probability great part of the expense of the impending Campaign would have been saved, and independency established, without breach of Treaties: What the Contingent issue may be, God only knows? To him only we must depend for our Success & prosperity. I do not mean to charge Congress with Neglect of duty, the bare Majority to whom delay may be attributed, I suppose have Acted for the best, in their opinion, & I wish the issue may prove that they have Acted wisely.  The Congress emissions to this time do not amount to 127 Mill[ion]s of Dollars, & it does not intend at any rate to exceed 160 or 170 M[illon]s, not even so much if there is a possibility to avoid it, the greatest of these Sums may be easily sunk, but in my opinion it ought not to be done too rapidly. Exertion is nevertheless necessary at this time to prevent further depreciation; the great cause of which may be as justly attributed to speculation as to the Sum of Money in circulation. One of these causes we can remove, the other I fear is not within our power. We want virtue-a Melancholy reflection to all those who have the real Interest & happiness of their Country at heart.  The late Captures made by the Continental Frigates will Sell for more Money than the Continental Navy Cost.  The Papers you desired me to get for you are not to be had in Town.

You know I mention such things in perfect confidence to yourself & Mr. Gervais.  General Washington writes that the Enemy had made a descent upon the Jerseys with a view of surprizing some of our outposts & of plundering; in the former they failed & upon the whole had made a poor adventure. North River remains yet unprovided with Cannon, how shall I account for the quietness of the New York Delegates on this occasion? Is not North River the Door leading to those parts of that State which the Enemy are not yet possessed of & will not the complete possession of those parts give them the whole of the State of Rhode Island & endanger Connecticut? What said Hamlet?  I do not like appearances-a Great Man in a late conversation which he had obtruded on me very improperly & which it did not become me to understand, & so I intimated to him, dropped a menace which shocked me-\""we have had & may yet obtain better terms from Great Britain.\"" \""Therefore you should be moderate in your demands\""-& now the strife is for turning out an honest faithful Servant, merely for being possessed of those bad qualities of honesty & fidelity & to put in a supple Jack. We want Men of Spirit & inflexible honesty here. Some very honest worthy Men we have, but they are not of the temper which is necessary for stemming a torrent of cunning artful misrepresentations. I act such a part as tends in some degree to disappoint or procrastinate evil purposes, to mortify the schemers, without exposing my conduct to any thing more than their teeth outward censure. They see & are convinced that I am of no set-party, & that I have no projects in view for aggrandizing or benefiting myself. I speak plain truth & feel no inclination to deviate to the right or to the left for the purpose of gaining applause from any Man or set of Men-one set are now convinced that I am neither to be wheedled nor frighted into their measures & yet I vote with them as often as they appear to be right.  MAY 3, 1779  Pray excuse me to His Excellency the Governor for not writing by this opportunity, I have no proper subject at this moment-the Lieut.

He is induced to indulge their wishes as well as to show more explicitly the reasons which determined his voice on the decision of a question on which he thinks the honor and interest of the United States highly depends. (1)  He has frequently declared that Mr. A. Lee had not the confidence of the court of France, His reasons for this declaration are among others, that he was repeatedly told this by Messrs. De Beaumarchais, Ray de Chaumont, the Chevalier Grand and his Brother Mr. Grand,(2) Gentlemen who all at various times acted as secret agents between the Commissioners and the court of France, in whose assertions he placed confidence, because he saw that the Court intrusted them with secrets of the highest importance, and because he never found Himself deceived by these Gentlemen in any MAY 3, 1779  other information he had the honor to receive from them, while imployed by the Commissioners abroad. He was informed & beleives, that this want of Confidence arose from information given by Mr. Garnier Charge des Affaires for the court of Versailles at London, That Ld. Shelburne and Mr. A. Lee left London in concert to visit France immediately after the arrival of Mr. Deane in that Country. He believes that the Court was confirmed in these suspicions by Mr Lees visits to Ld. Shelburne while at Paris, and he knows that several of high rank were alarmed and apprehensive that the secrets of the court would be betrayed from this Connection with the opposition in England, as will appear from the following extract of instructions given by the Ct. D'Estaing to Mr Deane at the very time Ld. Shelburne was at Paris. A copy of the instructions is in the hands of the Underwritten transcrib'd from the Original by Colonel Nicholas Rogers of Maryland & Himself when he received a Message from the Ct. Estaing desiring Him to return it.  \""L'unite secrette des enterets qui existe entre la France, I'Espagne et les Americans etant plus grande plus durable plus necessaire que celle qui attache les Anglais de l'opposition au sort de l'Amerique, il en resulte que Monsr Deane do it avoir plus de confiance dans ces deux puissances que dans des particuliers qui ne voulent uniquement que chasser des Ministres pour remplacer. II semble aussi que sa confiance dans les membres de l'opposition ne doit pas aller jusq'a leur dire tout ce que la France et L Espagne font ou promettent de faire; L'esperance de causer une revolution dans le ministre anglais sufferait peutetre pour en rendre la publication aussi avantageux au part de l'opposition qu'elle serait nuisible a l'Amerique: rien est plus a redoutter que de voir la bonne volonte se changer en mefiance, car en negotiation la mefiance eloigne ceux que l'interet raproche. II semble aussi qu'il faut soigneusement eviter de compromettre, d'embarasser une grande puissance sur des petits objets et cela dans le temps qu'on en espere des grands services: C'est encore sur ce point important que les veritables interets de l'amerique different de ceux du parti de l'opposition.[\""] This suspicion was farther confirmed by Mr Lees connection with Ct. De Lauregais of whom Ct. De'Estaing speaks in the following manner in the peice above mentioned \""Excepte son intime Liason avec Monsr Le Compte De Lauregais, et que l'amitie de ce dernier pour my Lor Shelburne dont l'addresse et les projets sont connus pourrait faire transpirer ce que le Ministre de France voudrait que fut ignore, sans que cet accident arrivat par la Faute ni par le canal des charge des Affaires de l'Amerique.\"" Mr. Lee Himself was so sensible of this suspicion that he wrote to Monsr. Le Compte de Vergennes or Monsr Girard on the Subject, which letter was carried by the underwritten to the Bureau for foreighn Affairs at Versailles, & Mr Lee received an answer, a copy of which no doubt he transmitted to some one of his correspondents on this side of the Atlantic. Ld. Shelburne is particularly disagreable to the Bourbon courts, because he formed the desighn of exciting a revolt in Mexico & for this purpose pensioned a French Nobleman, a Major general in the   service of France, who had offerd his aid to effect this, from his acquaintance with the principal Inhabitants of that part of the New World and the underwritten was informed that the Ct. D'Estaing alluded to this project in the above extract. The honorable notice taken of the Underwritten in consequence of the Strong recommendations of the Marquis de la Fayette to his Family & their connections gave him an opportunity of knowing the Sentiments of many persons of high rank & influence & theirs corresponded intirely with what has been before related. The consideration which the Underwritten injoyed from their Notice will appear by the letter annexed,(3) which he would have blushed to place on the files of Congress had they not been already loaded with gross misrepresentation of his conduct & as he hopes unmerited Abuse.  The same Gentlemen and others informed Him that Mr. Lee was equally disagreable to the Ct. D'Aranda, & he knows that the Spanish Minister at the Hague expressed his Chagrin on hearing that Mr Lee was appointed Commissioner to Spain in the Place of Dr. Franklin. Ct. D'Aranda declared that Mr Lees intended visit to Madrid was known to most of the Bankers there, before he quitted the French Dominions, & that this notoriety occasioned the English Ambassador to expostulate with the Spanish Ministry which induced the necessity of sending a Gentleman to meet Him at Burgos. It was well known in England that Mr Lee was gone to Spain, as will appear by the following extract of a letter from Edward Bancroft to the underwritten dated London March 4th 1777  \""Mr Sayre is now out of Confinement & desirous of some kind of imployment out of England, probably he will pay our friends a visit. He regrets that Prince Arthur has left France. Ld. Shelburne told Ld. Cambden that he was sent to Spain on acct. of his connection with him Ld. Shelburne.\""  The animosities among the Commissioners are so publicly known that the Underwritten deems it unnecessary to inlarge on the Subject. He cannot however omit observing that Jealousies & suspicions took place before Mr Lees appointment between that Gentleman & Mr Deane as will appear from a Letter of the Former to the underwritten dated Octobr 1776 a copy of which is in the Possession of the house being put into the hands of the Committee to Whom were referrd the Letters of Messrs Lee, Franklin, Deane & Izard respecting the Underwritten. He begs leave to produce an extract of a letter in answer to Mr Lee, in which he endeavord to remove his Jealousies & He appeals to Mr Deane, if he did not write to him about the same time, to remove the cause by writing frequently to Mr Lee. The extract is as follows from a Letter written from Amsterdam dated Nov. 1st 1776. [\""]Believe me My Dr. Sir that any thing which is likely to hurt the common cause gives me as well as yourself much uneasiness. I know no other reason for Mr D___s silence than the busy life he leads or that he trusted while I resided with him he could by my means answer with greater security to you your Letters. I believe no difference subsists  between him and your Brothers in America, what has happen'd since I left Paris, I am ignorant of\"" &c &c.  The underwritten thought those Jeaulousies & animosities Disgracefull, because they impeded the transaction of Public Business & because they were so public as to be known to almost Every Frenchman & American who visited either of the Commissioners. Injurious, because being known to your Enemies if Doctor Berkenhout is to be credited, they prevented an application to your Commissioners to bring about a reconciliation, untill Mr A. Lee could inform Him that this difference would not render an application inneffectual, or to that purpose Injurious in another way, because Our Enemies were incouraged to prosecute the War on a supposition that these Jealousies & animosities would render our Negotiation at the French Court unsuccessfull. This will appear from the following Extract of a letter from Matthew Ridley to the underwritten dated London Novr. 18th 1777.  \""It has already been held out here that your Councils are weak, that dissention prevails among you, that Congress in their appointment of Men of such Jarring tempers have discovered a great want of Judgement & that this circumstance must in time without other Assistance effectually ruin your plans. This is held out without real knowledge or information to spirit the people here in prosecuting the War. In some measure it has its Effect. If so in this State of it, how much more so when they think they have real foundation.\"" The underwritten is sorry to repeat what abundant Evidence in the possession of the house has already told them of the unconciliatory disposition of Mr Lee, tis sufficient to know that he has disgusted the French Court, his Colleagues Messrs. Franklin & Deane, Messrs. Chaumont, Beaumarchais, Holker & the two Grands, all men in Confidence of the Court, besides Bancroft, Moylan, Ross, Williams, Jones, Nicholson (4) & many others whom it is needless to mention. The underwritten would be still more sorry to record little anecdotes which would disgrace your files, the Persons of whom they are related, & even the Relater. If however any Gentlemen are interesfed or desirous of farther Information, He assures them on his honor that he will give them in private every satisfaction which such curiosity merits. The originals of the copies produced may be seen by any gentleman who chuses to apply to the underwritten.  The late Debates in Congress on the subject of conversations with the Minister might excuse the underwritten from Commenting on the attempt made to misrepresent his sentiments while abroad. He cannot help observing however that it must appear very Extraordinary that he should say to men whom he scarce knew & saw but seldom, what several of the Gentlemen who were his Friends & Constant Companions at Nantes cannot recollect, altho one of them lived in the house with him for some time. He will content himself with submitting Copies of their letters to Him on the Subject of the extracts & copies of a Letter he received by Thornton from Mr A. Lee with the answer he returned by the Same Person (5) who staid  MAY 3, 1 779  but two days at Nantes & leave the Candid to Judge whether he could in the temper of mind, he then was, speak in the manner he is represented to have done.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia May the 3d. 1779 Always attentive to your commands, I have obtained here, and now inclose you the song and the receipt you desired. I once had both of them at home, but they are mislaid among a mass of papers, so that I could find neither previous to my leaving Chantilly, or your request would then have been complied with. I hope you have received the pamphlet I sent you some weeks ago entitled \""Observations on the American revolution\"" containing a collection of the most material congress papers with a few remarks interspersed, in order to shew in one comprehensive view the progress of our glorious revolution, and to rectify some false representations of MAY 3, 1 779  the British' Commissioners.(1) This pamphlet was sent by an Express that came here from Mr. Harvey, and returned to Williamsburg, with intention to follow Mr. Harvey to Albemarle if he found him not at the former of these places. I wish it were in my power to entertain you with news, but we are here as void of that as if profound peace reigned thro'out the world. We have not heared from Europe for four months, and altho there then seemed a disposition in many Powers to restore the general tranquility, yet all were industriously preparing for war, and some being actually engaged, the fate of millions hung in doubtful ballance.  The armies here continue quiet within their quarters. That of the enemy by their late embarkation of nine regiments, rendered too weak for taking the field, must content itself with holding N. York as the Gibralter of N. America. If we can baffle the Southern invasion, it is clear to me that the game will be presently up with our enemies, and that they will be compelled by inevitable necessity to be content with the loss of thirteen flourishing states. A very fit consequence of the foolish and wicked attempt to reduce to slavery so many free, useful, and affectionate friends. I hope that when you and my other friends consider all things, that you will not blame me for sending my resignation to the Assembly (2). I am realy injured in my health by such continued, close application; and a long neglected numerous family demands some attention. Add to these, that persecuted as I have been by the united voice of toryism, peculation, faction, envy, malice, and all uncharitableness, nothing but the certain prospect of doing essential service to my country can compensate for the injuries I receive. It would content me indeed to sacrifice every consideration to the public good that would result from such persons as yourself, Mr. Wythe, Mr. Mason and some others being in Congress. I would with persevering ardor press thro every difliculty in conjunction with such Associates. I am informed that Colo. Blackburn intends to propose a bill this Session for the relief of Landlords. I should suppose that the wisdom and justice of the Legislature can and will devise some remedy for the relief of this class of people among us. I am one, who have the misfortune to see myself and family nearly ruined by the retrospective effect of our law. Almost the whole of my landed estate was rented out some years before this war for low cash rents, and under the faith of existing law which secured me Specie for my rents. The vast sums of paper money that have been issued (& this being now a tender for the discharge of rents growing from old contracts) and the consequent depreciation, has well nigh effected an entire transfer of my estate to my Tenants. This year Sir, the rents of 4000 acres of fine Land will not buy me 20 barrels of Corn! I am very far from desiring that the law should place these contracts litterally as they were, but substantially so, it is [&? s]eems just that they should be. When the Tenant agreed to pay me 6. for an hund. acres rent he could not sell his Tobo. for more than 16 or 18 shillings an hundred. Now he sells his Tobo. for £10 and 12 per Cent. It does not appear to me that the public good can be concerned in thus transfering the property of Landlords to their   Tenants. But public justice demands that the true meaning, and genuine spirit of contracts should be complied with. It appears to me that an Act of Commutation might set this business right by directing the payment in produce at the prevailing price of such produce when the Contracts were made, leaving this to be settled by the Courts annually as they formerly did in the case of exchange. I well know your love of justice to be such that your approbation will be given to any proper plan for doing right in the premisses. For my own part, I am willing to suffer every thing rather than injure the public cause, but in the present state of things I can see no possibility of public injury from thus rendering private justice. I am with much esteem and regard dear Sir your most obedient and very humble Servant, Richard Henry Lee  ""

We come now to communicate to you our plan for the employment of those Vessels the execution of which we deem highly important to the United States & we doubt not on your part but every measure within your power will be taken that may tend to hasten the speedy accomplishment of it. It is our desire that the Confederacy, the Warren, the Queen of France, the Ranger, the Jason, the General Gates and Sloop Providence shall be joined together and Sail in Company to the Southward (and we shall take measures that the Frigate Deane shall join them afterwards) and there attack the enemys sea force on the Coast of Georgia, which from the Accounts we have of that force may be easily subdued by ours collected, which will procure honor and advantage to the United States and much Interest to the Captors. To effect this valuable purpose great expedition and equal secrecy will be necessary-that the latter may be secured we propose that this plan shall not be communicated even to the Captains of the Ships, but Sealed Instructions given them not to be opened until they are at Sea.  You will direct them to call off the harbour of Charles Town and despatch a Tender to the Governor of South Carolina for intelligence of the Situation and force of the enemy-to request Pilots for the more MAY 4, 1779  Southern Coasts and Such aid of armed Vessels as may be there ready to join them-That as little delay as possible take place at Charles Town, but that they proceed to take, burn, Sink and destroy as many of the enemies Armed vessels as possible, and haveing finished this business they Are then to proceed and throw themselves in the way of the homeward bound West India Ships. Such farther Instructions as may Occur to you as proper for the execution of this valuable business, you will please to give.  We propose that you should employ the Hibernia & two of the Packets lately built as Tenders to this fleet if in your judgment they are suitable for that purpose and they be Officered and Manned out of the fleet.  We are informed that Mr Langdon at Portsmouth hath under his Care some small Cannon belonging to the Public which may be proper for Arming these Tenders. You will take such measures for joining the Confederacy with the Other Ships as you may think proper, and we request you will inform us by every opportunity of the progress you make in preparing the Fleet and when they will Sail. The frigate Providence must still be reserved to execute Such business as we shall here after direct. We request you will inform Lieutenant Simpson that it is our desire that he continue to command the Ranger and use his utmost diligence in manning her and we should be glad of your opinion whether promoting Mr Simpson to a Captaincy would be injurious to the service or not.

  Sir, Philaa. 4th May 1779. I received your Excellency's Favor of the 30th April yesterday Afternoon and am informed this Morning that Persons in this City are purchasing by Authority of your State. The Price given hitherto by the Commissaries hath not exceeded £17.10. but at once they have offered £22.10. which cannot fail to produce very ill Consequences as the Scarcity will always be greater while the Prices rise. By the Estimate you have done me the Honor to enclose I find that we may count upon 6,000 Barrels already secured. Of this Richard Dallam is to furnish 2,000 which he had formerly purchased as a Deputy to the Commissary Genl. I am however content that he be considered as a State Purchaser and have accordingly directed the Commissary Genl. to receive from him the Ballance of Cash in his Hands which I have done because there is a Propriety in keeping the Accounts entirely distinct. I have to request Sir that Strict Orders be given to confine the State Purchasers to their several Districts because in calculating the Supplies and taking Measures to obtain them it was presumed that they would be so restrained and Arrangements made accordingly. I have further to request that if it be not already done no more than 10,000 Blls. be bought by your State as I have a fair Prospect of obtaining upon good Terms what may be necessary beyond that Quantity and that which is in the Magazines. In order that your Purchasers may not themselves clash with each other I would submit to your Excellency's Consideration the following Arrangement viz. that they be directed to procure  James Govane 1,400 Wm.

One to prevent a Competition between your own Servants and the other to take off that false Idea of our Necessities which I am perswaded has greatly contributed to enhance the Prices to their present inordinate Rates.

Mr. Merriweather Srnith who appears in Dunlap's Packet of the 6th May 1779 to have called for the Yeas and Nays on the question in Con- MAY 6, 1 779  gress \""shall Mr. Arthur Lee be recalled\"" had on a preceding day pressed for the recal of that Gentleman, to the end that he should answer to Charges exhibited against him by Mr. Deane in his Narrative. (1)  Mr. Laurens replied that he knew of no charges against Mr. Lee, that there were indeed insinuations, which appeared to him to be frivolous or groundless & some of them to be scandalous as well as frivolous, But that his view being to obtain justice both to the Public & to individuals, he should chearfully give his voice for the recal of Mr. Lee, provided his accuser Mr. Deane, were detained in America, in order to support what had been called his \""charges against Mr. Lee.\""  Mr. Smith replied he could not consent to detain Mr. Deane, who might be allowed to pursue his own affairs and to attend when Mr. Lee should be on the spot.  Mr. Laurens rejoined, if this be the Gentleman's scheme for harrassing Mr. Lee I shall not consent to his recal, it is not so easy a business as the Honorable Gentleman seems to conceive to cross & recross the Atlantic Ocean in a time of War. Mr. Lee & Mr. Deane upon the Gentleman's principle will be reduced to the state of two Buckets alternately going up & down a Well meeting only midway.  On a subsequent day when the same subject was under debate in Congress, Mr. Laurens repeated his former proposition for detaining Mr. Deane, & added \""at public expence\"" & for recalling Mr. Lee.(2)  This second overture seemed to be eagerly embraced & committed to writing by a Gentleman sitting & taking Notes at the lower Table.  On the Morning of the 4th May before the question for the recal was put,(3) the Honble Mr. Burke shewed Mr. Laurens a written motion which he said he intended to present to Congress that Morning, to the following effect Vizt-\""Resolved that Mr. Deane be ordered not to depart from America until the Honorable Arthur Lee shall arrive\"" &c &c.  Mr. Laurens viewed this intimation by Mr. Burke as a challenge or claim of his promise to vote for the recal of Mr. Lee, provided Mr. Deane should be detained in America to support his pretended charges, & therefore he observ'd to that Gentleman, that he should certainly keep his promise if Mr. Deane would obey such an Order of Congress & give security for his remaining in America even by a promisary Letter.  Mr. Burke said \""surely Mr. Deane will obey the Order of Congress, what security would you require?\""  Mr. Laurens answered, I question whether Mr. Deane will hold himself obliged to obey such an Order. As to security a written promise by Mr. Deane [will] satisfy me-therefore make your motion as you please only give me assurance that Mr. Deane will remain here until Mr. Lee's arrival & an hearing in Congress & I will vote for the Recal of Mr. Lee.  Mr. Burke offered his motion to Congress, some debates or remarks on that side of the Room ensued-I rose to speak to it & said \""I should support the Motion provided the House could be assured Mr. Deane would obey their Order. I was proceeding & had intended to add, that the assurance of the Honorable Gentleman who had made the Motion or of  MAY 6, 1779  any other Gentleman on behalf of Mr. Deane that he would not depart from America until further Orders from Congress, would secure my Vote for the Recal of Mr. Lee, but the president, interrupted me by informing the House, that Mr. Burke had withdrawn his Motion.  These are simple facts. Men of Candor & in the least acquainted with the proceedings of popular Assemblies will require no Comment from me. Such Men will instantly draw proper conclusions & will not wonder that I refused to join in a persecution. Henry Laurens.  ""

  Sir, Philadelphia May the 6th 1779 The inclosed letter (1) being referred by Congress to the Virginia Delegates we have judged it proper to request of you that you will be pleased to assist us with your advice upon the occasion.  We see this business involved in circumstances of such a nature as to create much difficulty and embarrassment. On the one side is presented MAY 6, 1779  Colo. Spotswoods merit as an Officer, his seniority of service, the peculiar situation under which he resigned, and that resignation not accepted by Congress(2)-On the other hand we see a probable discontent in the army, arguments drawn from his resignation, and the measures consequent thereupon such as the Office he held being filled by another, and the new arrangement having passed him by unnoticed.  In this state of things we are puzzled to know what report to make. We could wish earnestly to do justice to Colo. Spotswoods merit and his claims, whilst in doing so, we are unable to foresee the consequent ill effects that may be produced by it in the army from dissatisfied ideas of injured rank. Whether an adequate provision may not be made for him from the circumstance of the new Levies of Virginia (going Southward) which will amount to about 2000 men, we cannot be certain.  We have understood from Colo. Spotswood what when that service was over, if any rank given him there should create dissatisfaction in the army, that he would be willing to resign, after having had that opportunity of distinguishing his zeal for the service of his country. But how this can be done, unless by his being created a Brigadier is the question, and what effect this may have on the arrangement and in the sentiments of the army we are greatly at a loss to judge. We wish exceedingly to be favored with your sentiments on this subject, for which we shall be much obliged.(3)  We have the honor to be with very particular esteem and regard, Sir your most obedient and most humble servants,  Meriwether Smith Richard Henry Lee Cyrus Griffin Wm.

It is with the highest pleasure we transmit to your Excellency a copy of the Acts of Congress of the 5th & this day, in aid of South Carolina & Georgia, upon the Report of the Committee made on the 5th upon the letter of the 5th of April from Lieut Governor Bee. A necessary application to the Commander in Chief upon the subject of this business, has prevented its being sooner finished. (1) And, except in the instance of an application in January last by Mr. Drayton for the march of the North Carolina troops & the sailing of a Naval force to South Carolina & Georgia, Congress have chearfully adopted every measure in their power which has been advised for the aid of those States. (2)  The pressing calls from the main army, for military Stores by a certain & short day, still prevents our being able to send off those destined for South Carolina: we hope, that within ten days, they will be sent forward.(3)  We have the honor to be, Sir, Your Excellency's most obedt. & most humble Servants.  [P.S.] Mr. Laurens having desired me to pen a public letter from the Delegates of South Carolina in consequence of the Acts of Congress of the 5 & 7, May, in aid of South Carolina & Georgia, I, William Henry Drayton, draughted the above: & offered it to Mr. Laurens for his signature. He objected to the second period (4) in the second paragraph, saying, Congress had not done so, & that as we were not called upon to say anything on that subject, he did not chuse to Say any thing at present. I answered, that I had inserted that period, because I thought it stated facts, which should be known in Carolina, as Mr. S. Adams had informed me, that he had been informed from S. Carolina, that a different idea was entertained there which was injurious to Congress & had desired me to place the matter in its true point of view, & that he had mentioned the same circumstances to him, Mr. Laurens. Mr. Laurens persisting in his objection to that period in the public letter, I wrote over a copy of that letter verbatim, leaving out the period objected to, & it was signed by Mr. Laurens & myself. MAY 7, 1779  However, in order to remove improper ideas respecting the Conduct of Congress in aid of South Carolina & Georgia, I think it is proper to desire a few Members of Congress competent to the subject, to sign this paper if they think the period objected to is a proper State of circumstances.(5)  ""

I think it will be best to finish the former; I have three times repeatedly proposed to give my voice for recalling Mr. Arthur Lee provided Congress would order Mr. Deane to remain in America to support his charges.

  Sir, Philadelphia May 8th 1779 We had the honour of inclosing, in a letter hastily written to your excellency last Tuesday,(1) a copy of a Resolution of Congress approving the raising of a brigade in the State of Rhode-Island &c: And on friday morning last received your letter of the 26th April, inclosing a letter to Congress open. We perused, sealed and presented it to the President. It was read and is referred to Genl. Washington, as you will see by the inclosed resolution. (2) We took this opportunity and brot upon the tapis our motion recommending to our Sister States to send to and keep up their quotas of militia in our State, which passed. (3) A copy of it we now inclose to your excellency. We will procure the commissions you require and send them by the Post.(4) We have spoken to the President for them, but he could not prepare them to be sent by this opportunity.  We hope that the resolutions of Congress will be agreeable to the State, and produce happy effects. The Condition annexed to the resolution, approving the raising a brigade in our State, we would have prevented if it had been in our power; but it was impossible, as you will see when the Journals are printed. As to those Soldiers who shall be inlisted before the resolution reaches your excellency there can be, we think, no difficulty; as to those who may be inlisted thereafter, the State will add to their bounty or devise some other method which will give them satisfaction without violating that condition. If Congress should have approved of giving additional pay to the Soldiers of our Brigade they must have advanced the pay of all the continental Soldiers, which, at this time, would prove ruinous to our finances. When money is wanted to pay the troops in our State or for other military purposes, the best way would be for the paymaster to write to the Treasury board setting forth the Sum wanted and the User to which it is to be applied, and to have his application backed by the commanding Officer in the Department. A Sum of money which issued from the Treasury for the paymaster, not long since, we imagin had not reached the State when your letter was wrote. A letter from Genl. Gates, in which he applies for money, came to Congress by the last post, and is referred to the Treasury board,(5) with the President whereof I have conversed on the subject. MAY 8, 1 779  The recommendation to our neighbouring States to send to our defence their stipulated quotas will we believe have little or no effect upon Connecticut, her shores being exposed to the enemy. We expect that it will stimulate New Hampshire and Massachusetts-bay to a performance of their engagements; for they are without any reasonable excuse.  We trust that Genl. Washington will attend to the necessities of our State, and not deem it inconsistent with the good of the Service to let Genl. Glover's Brigade remain there, at least until our Brigade shall be completed and our Sister States have furnished out their Quotas. We were about to write to him upon this subject but upon being informed by Col. Wheelock, the bearer of your excellency's letter, that the State had written to Genls Washington and Greene we relinquish our design.  We have reason to think that Great-Britain will strengthen her armies in America, and that they will exert themselves to the utmost of their power, this campaign. It behoves us therefore to guard ourselves. They have possessed themselves of Georgia, and aim at the possession of SouthCarolina. If they should obtain that, and add our State to their acquisitions, which God in his infinite mercy, forbid, the War would be protracted to a most ruinous length or we must be compelled to submit to a disadvantageous, dishonorable peace. We have had no news from the Southern army for 16 days past. Col. Laurens told Mr. Ellery yesterday that he had heard it was said at N. York that there had been an action between Genls Lincoln & Prevost, in which the former had gained an Advantage. We wish it may be true. Last week the King of France, in a letter to Congress, announced the birth of a Princess, and gave us fresh & strong assurances of his friendship. A Committee, according to form & etiquette, waited upon the Minister with their congratulations on this happy occasion; and a proper answer will be written to the letter of his most Christian Majesty. Congress are now engaged in our foreign Affairs, and as soon as they can get through them, will take up the business of financing.  We are almost worn out with a constant Attendance on Congress for seven months, and wish that two of the Gentlemen now elected may come on immediately.  If any thing new should come to hand between this and the next post, we will impart it by him; in the mean time we have only to add that we are with the highest Sentiments of respect, Yr.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia May 9th 1779 I have the pleasure of your favor of the 7th Inst. (1) Your Judgmt. on the present situation of our affairs perfectly corresponds with my own. Had early requisitions of Men & Provisions been made to the States in December we should, in all humane probability have commanded a peace sooner than it will now be in our power, for want of them. However, I must observe to you, with all our remisness, our affairs are far from being desperate. If we talked, less, and thought more than we do in Congress, our business in my Opinion would be better conducted.  I wish with all my heart that we had an Executive, and agree with you in opinion that the want of it, is a strong reason for entering into some kind of confederation or other-But it has always hurt me, to think of confederating on terms that would not be lasting. I believe that Congress are now most disposed to explain the Confederation than it was sometime ago. The necessity of its being done has opened the Eyes of some of the Congress. But at present, Business of greater importance takes up all our time. God grant us Wisdom to determine with that Judgrnent & precision wch the grand object requires, we should do.  I have not the least doubt but a Loan sufficient for the use of the Army might be obtained if proper applications were made. If the States would Tax roundly, no doubt but the general demand for Money for that purpose would appreciate the Currency, especially if we could fall upon measures that would prevent Speculation, for that has been the bane & cause of our present distresses.  Connecticut has raised double the Sum this year, that was required of that State by Congress-a wise measure, wch. I wish other States would adopt.  I had drafted a Letter for my Collegues to join me in, advising the Governor & Council to spare at least 5 peices of Cannon to Congress, but as we had other matters to mention wch required the determination of Congress-Viz. an order for Eight hundred thousand Dollars & the opinion of the board of Treasury respecting the Emissions of May and April- the Post had set out before we could obtain the order & opinion, & for these reasons it happened, that you did not receive the joint Letter of the Delegates, before this Post.(2)  I am happy in being informed that Speculation in our State is almost at a Stand, I wish to God it were so in every other, but at this place it seems MAY 9,1779  to be as high as ever. We never knew distress till this vice pervaded the Continent. In 1775, every man was ready to offer his Service, & contribute his Mite-But oh! Jeruselem, Jeruselem, how art, 'thou fallen!  It will be neither in your power or mine, to keep up so regular a correspondence as we could wish, the intervention of public business will prevent it. But you may assuredly depend upon my giving you the earliest intellengence of every important occurrence that may cast up.  I pray God that the Troops lately embarked at New York may not be intended for Maryland & Virginia-if they should, I hope my Countrymen will not flinch in the Day of Trial-nay I am confident that on this, as on every other occasion, they will approve themselves true Marylanders-i.e., neither to be menaced by power, nor frighten'd by danger.

Doctor Read I am sure will do me the Justice to inform you that although your first letter was mislaid and the one now before me strangely concealed, I have upon every occasion testified my regard for you by showing him more than bare civility.  Our public intelligence varies exceedingly from the tenor of that which we received from the same high authority about three Months ago, if we give full Credit to what is now said, we ought to be diligent in making ample preparations for an active bloody Campaign, but proper reflection upon the many political manevres and humbugs which I have been witness of induces me to repeat respecting the latter what I had said in the  MAY 10, 1779  former instance-\""it may be so,\"" being asked two days ago by a Gentleman, \""Are we likely to have peace soon, tis so whispered abroad.\"" I replied turn up a ha'penny and call head or tail-'tis indeed whispered that we shall very soon have terms of Peace tendered to us, probably we shall be told to morrow the Enemy is making the most vigorous exertions for prosecuting the War against us and so it precisely happened.

The Northern design I consider clearly indispensible, as without it the combined force of Indians, Tories, and not improbably, troops from Some part of Canada must fall on Pennsylvania agst. which every Stroke from the Northward has been directed Since July last-whereby great devastation, loss of property & blood has ensued. The Northern affair cannot be well conducted without Skill, prudence, firmness & Strength-An unwieldy or impeding apparatis is agst. the Success. As the neighbourhood of Fort Pitt is not threatened that I know of, will not the leaving it's defence to the Militia of that Country for two or three months, be a less risque to the Service generally, than either that the Commander of the Expedition shou'd prove weak, or your Army be too much striped to make him Strong?

The MAY 10, 1779  Destination of this armament cannot be ascertained, but from its consisting in part of Horse, and from other Circumstances, it is believ'd, to be designed against some of the Middle or Southern States. I therefore think it my Duty to give You the earliest Notice of this Advice, that in Case the Enemy bend their Course to our Bay or to Chesapeak, the Delaware State may be in preparation for defending itself or cooperating in the Common Cause. (1)  I would be more particular on this subject, but that Congress has this Moment resolv'd to send Copies of the Dispatches to the Southward, and Mr. Jay assures Me You shall receive one.(2)  Your Letter came to my Hands, but I have not been able to obtain any satisfactory Information, concerning the prisoners you mention.(3) Humanity & your Recommendation will powerfully induce Me to pay Attention to their Case, and I shall transmit to you the Result of my Enquiries & Applications.  I mention'd Mr White's Affair to Mr. Vandike (4), who tells Me, the papers are in Mr. McKean's Hands. He is now on the Circuit. When he returns, I will endeavour to have that Business finish'd according to your Desire.  The very important Business of the Quarter masters & Commissaries departments demands the most speedy & vigorous measures.

I most earnestly wish You would and if possible, before the Meeting of our Assembly, which I understand, is to be on the 17th.

We have most momentous Business to transact. It may happen in managing the Affairs of so extensive a Confederacy, that particular states may be more interested in certain points than other States or than the Confederacy in general.  My Opinion is clear, that the Interests of each State being Objects comprehended within the Confederation, are to be regarded as the Interests of the whole, & as such to be contended for and defended. [On] Interests of this kind, Difficulties, I apprehend, will not arise-but on Interests, beyond these Limits they may. On these, my Opinion is also clear, that as a Delegate I am bound to prefer the general Interests of the Confederacy to the partial Interests of Constituent Members, how many soever they be, & however respectable and meritorious; and further, that  if ever such a Competition should arise, it is my Duty to prefer the particular Interests of the State that honours Me with her Confidence & invests Me with a share of her power, to the particular Interest of any other State on this Continent.  I cannot be more particular on these very important Considerations, not being at Liberty to disclose the Subjects of Debate to which they may refer. But obviously just as my Determinations seem to Myself on the most mature Deliberation to be yet so strangely crooked do the plain Lines of sound Policy appear by passing thro some Mediums, that I should receive great satisfaction in finding Myself fortified in the Resolutions that will actuate my Conduct, by knowing that the sentiments leading Me to those Resolutions are approved by my Country.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia, 10th May, 1779. I wish it were in my power to write you satisfactorily on the state of our public affairs. My residence here is of too short a date to enable to form a proper judgment of them. (1) There are matters of great concern now before congress, of which I am not at liberty to speak freely, tho' I am of opinion we may have peace on honorable & advantageous terms, in the course of the ensuing winter. We have pretty certain intelligence that a considerable reinforcement (the N. York papers of the 1st of May say 8000 men) will be sent over immediately; and if so there will, no doubt, be an active campaign, which it is generally supposed, will be chiefly confined to the southern states, where we are the most vulnerable-and from thence the enemy can more easily withdraw their troops to the West Indies, if occasion should require it.  I beg I may not be put in nomination at the ensuing election of delegates to serve in congress; as I find it next to impossible for me to serve longer than til August, should my country be disposed to continue me here; for besides my own loss of time, & the long separation from my family, my expences are so enormous that I find my fortune quite insufficient to support them. I am in private lodgings, with only a servant & two horses, which are in the continental stable, and I live as frugal as possible, notwithstanding which it costs me, at least, £25 a week, over & above my wages. If our assembly do not determine to support their delegates in congress,(2) they will shortly find that none of those of small fortunes will be able to continue here long enough to make themselves acquainted with the business they come to transact, so as to render them essential service; for I think I already discover men here who have local views, highly detrimental to the general good of the union.  Beef is from 12 to 15/ a pound, butter 20/, good lamb 20 dollars a quarter, & every thing else proportionably dear, and rising daily; from hence you may form some idea of what the decent support of your delegates will require. I wish not to put a shilling of public money in my pocket, & as the necessaries of life are daily rising, and what would now be an adequate allowance will not be so a month hence, I think it would be better for the delegates to render & account, of their expences, & let them  MAY 10, 1779  be paid by the treasurer. No man who could not be trusted to render a just account deserves a seat in congress.  You will pardon the liberty I have taken of mentioning this subject to you. I did it from a conviction that you will do what you think right on the occasion.  I beg the favor of a line when you have a leisure half hour. I shall remember your weeping willow, & am Yr. affct. friend & servt,  Wm. Fleming May 11th. I closed my letter yesterday morning, thinking it was post day, but have since been better informed; and as the paper of this day contains the latest advices we have, I inclose it for your amusement. Genl. Washington in a letter to Congress, dated the 7th is somewhat more particular than the paper respecting the embarkation from N. York. He says he received a letter from genl. Maxwell, who is near Amboy, the 5th. instant, informing \""that that day there sailed from N. York about 4 or 5000 troops, chiefly Brittish, supposed either for Georgia or the West Indies, & said to be commanded by generals Vaughan & Leslie.\"" The same day he recd. a letter from colo. Ford, stationed in the neighbourhood of Maxwell, with an acct. \""that the same day (the 5th) 27 square rigged vessels & 12 or 14 sloops & schooners put to sea, & steered S.E. 'til out of sight.\""-That by a prisoner from N. York he was informed that the report there was, that between 6 & 7000 troops were embarked (He sailed with them to the watering place) that there was a vast number of light horse [on] board; & the fleet was very full of men-their destination unknown to the officers, who were very anxious to be informed whether they were going. (3) Their conjectures were various-some for Georgia, some for Maryland, & some for Rh. Island. And that Genl. Clinton was said to be on board-but that genl. Washington thinks highly improbable. The general thinks, from the number of vessels, that the whole embarkation cannot exceed 4000 men.  We are just informed (by report) that two large French merchantmen, full of dry goods, are taken off the Cape of Delaware, & carried into N. York. Adieu.  ""

It is a Blessing which I have less enjoyd the Winter past than in any equal Part of my Life-I hope by the Blessing of God to recover it when I may have the Pleasure of living in my own Country.  We have had on the Carpet Questions relating to our Ministers abroad-Whether they should be recalled-It was agreed that the Question be put severally with Respect to Each-A Majority of Voices were against the Recall of Doctor Franklin, though some Gentlemen spoke warmly aginst him-Nat for the Recall of Dr. Lee met with an equal Division & so it was lost. I will only remark to you that after long Debates, in which as great Freedoms, I suppose were used as could be consistently with Decency and Truth; his Abilities, his Integrity & warm Attachment to America remain unimpeachable. It is unfortunate when Attempts are made to remove a Servant of the Publick, whose Fidelity shines the brighter, the more his Conduct is sifted, but so it will happen, when others wish to supplant him. I do not say this is the Case at present-I hope there is no Motive more unworthy; but I will not answer for all among the Thousands in America, who may conceit themselves fit for important Trusts, and some of them may shortly offer themselves with a View of serving such Purposes as may not be agreable to others.

Hyde a larger Sum than five hundred Thousand Dollars had not the Demands on the Treasury been so pressing  MAY 11, 1779  and of such a Nature as to render it impossible. We have now a Warrant for the further Sum of eight hundred Thousand Dollars, the greater part of which if not the whole, we expect to send forward to you in the course of this week. (1) This supply we hope will enable your Excellency to prosecute with success, the purchase of Flour &c for the Army.  General Washington at this time stands in need of heavy Cannon, for the further Defence of the North River, and the Necessity of being immediately supplied with at least five pieces, has induced Congress to apply to our State, for such Cannon as can be spared either on Loan or purchase, at the Election of the General Assembly.(2) Under the circumstances of this case, and knowing the Necessity, we cannot suppose the General Assembly (if you have not power already) can have any objections against granting the request of Congress. If you should lend the Cannon, Mr. Hughes who has now contracted with Congress for a considerable Number, will be directed to send to Annapolis or such place as you may direct, the like number and weight of metal, with those that shall be lent by the state.  Your letter of the 30th Apl does not clearly express in what way the Emissions of May and Apl. came into the State Treasuries. If by Taxes for the Continent, there can be no doubt but you may send, as soon as it is convenient, the several Sums in those Bills to the Continental Treasury; for the Resolves of Congress are express that they shall be received for Debts and Taxes into the continental Treasury and into the State Treasury for continental Taxes untill the first of June. If they came in on any other ground than for a continental Tax (altho not strictly within the Resolves of Congress), yet we think the State may, and we are of opinion you ought or it will be advantageous to the State, to consider them as brought in, in that light; And when the continental Tax is actually raised you may then reimburse the State Treasuries. Congress as they have no Authority, so they never will inquire into the manner by which the State has raised her quota. If however the Emissions alluded to above, were not expressly levied for Continental Taxes, and you do not, as we conceive you may, consider them in that light, no way is open but to throw them into the Loan office, either on Loan or to be exchanged, the former of these alternatives we do not approve of and the latter will deprive the State of the use of the Money for some Time.  Mr. Harwood's power as a continental Loan officer extends no further than to receive these Emissions either on loan or to be exchanged, we therefore think he did right in not receiving them in the way you proposed to him.  Enclosed you have Extracts of Letters from the General.(3) They were received yesterday and will be sent by the president to you, but least his Copy should miscarry, we have thought it proper to send you the one enclosed-their Destination is not known. To rescue the Troops of Burgoyne may possibly be part of their object, tho' the prevailing opinion is, that their main design is farther South.

(1)  The Governor of the Island, thinking it reasonable that the Owners should receive a Compensation for their Loss, recommended it to the Minister of the Marine of France, in a Letter whereof a translated Copy is enclosed, but the Captain of the Brigantine having neglected to take Duplicates of the Letter, rendered it necessary for the Owners, of whom Tristram Dalton Esqr. of Newbury Port in Massachusetts Bay was one, to take additional Steps for the recovering of their Interest. We think it adviseable for Mr. Dalton to obtain a Compensation in the Way proposed by the Governor of Guadaloupe, rather than by making a Claim thro' Congress on the principle of Right. As the Letter may require time, and produce an Altercation, neither agreable to the Court of France nor Congress and as We have no Reason to suppose that there was any Design in the Commandant of the Fort to insult the Flag of the United States or injure the property or Persons of its Citizens.  Having stated the Facts We submit to your Determination the Measures proper to be pursued & remain, Sir with great Respect your, most obedt & very hum Servts. S. Adams E. Gerry  S.

  Dear Sir, Philad. 15h May 1779. I find myself under the Necessity of expressing my wishes that it may be agreeable to your Excellency to transfer the non commissioned officers and Privates, Citizens of New York, late of Col. Malcolm's Regiment, to one of the Battallions of that State. After the Resolution to the same Effect in favour of the Pensylvania Companies,(1) of which at the time I much disapproved, it is difficult to assign any good Reason for a distinction among Troops of the same Corpse, & under Circumstances altogether similar: and we may be censured for not attempting at least to put them on an equal Footing. However had not the Men expressed so much dissatisfaction at being constrained to serve in the reformed Battallion, after so many of their officers had retird I shoud have been silent for your Excellency will do me the Justice to believe that I do great violence to my Feelings & to the Maxim I have endeavor'd to inculcate when I in the  MAY 15, 1779  most distant Degree interpose in a matter to which you alone, from a thorough knowledge of all it's Consequences, are competent. I am uncertain whether a formal Act of Congress is necessary, I rather presume your Powers are adequate: but however this may be, from a Reluctance to embarrass you on any Occasion, I shoud not reconcile it to myself to take any Step to accomplish this transfer without having previously consulted you.  If the Obstacles are important in your Opinion, I flatter myself that the State of which I am a Citizen will be contented, from the unreserved Confidence they Justly repose in your wisdom, Impartiality and attention to the general Interest, as well as from the lively Sense they entertain of your unwearied Exertions for their own more immediate Protection.(2)  I have the Honour to be, with every Sentiment of Respect and Affection, Sir, your Excellency's most Obedient & very humble Servant,  Jas.

  Mr. President 15 May 1779 The motion which was made yesterday (1) by one of the Honble Delegates from Virginia for reading a presumed Copy of a Letter said to have been written by me & printed in the Garrison of the Enemy on New York Island & for calling upon me to declare whether I had written such a Letter appeared to me, to be irregular, unprecedented, & full of dangerous consequences-derogatory to the Honor & dignity of Congress & alarming to the free & Independent Citizens of these United States- thence arose those cautions & admonitions, which a sense of duty prompted me to offer to the House while the subject was under debate & I rejoice in that Wisdom which was displayed by the House in overruling the attempt.  Sir. Had the Gentleman who made the motion called on me & in proper terms enquired whether the printed Letter was a Copy of an original Address from me to Governor Houston I would have given him all the satisfaction that could have been desired by any Man of true honor.  And now Sir-As-If I have been guilty of aught criminal-or have inadvertently expressed any thing amiss in my correspondence as a private Citizen, with Mr. Houston, I would rather receive a Censure or a reproof from Congress than be charged with a want of Candor or commit my conduct to the whispers of malice-I take the liberty of informing Congress that I did on the 27th August last write a private Letter to Governor Houston.  If the House shall judge it proper to determine by a Vote that they may of right demand a Copy of that private Letter & shall in consequence of such Vote call on me. Or if Congress shall be pleased by a Vote to direct their President in writing to request me to lay before them a Copy of that Letter I will in either case produce a genuine & true Copy, reserving to myself in the mean time the Privilege of voting as I certainly should vote if I were not a party concerned.  I confide in the candor of the House to order this address to be entered on the Journal & if the House shall be pleased to call for or request a Copy of my Letter I shall expect that will also be entered on the Journal.

  Sir, [May 15? 1779] I have reserved to my self a right of Voting on this very extraordinary and unprecedented motion (1), not from any apprehensions of inconvenience to my self, because I am sure the contents of my Letter to Govr. Houston, are not only inoffensive but proper, and breath a Spirit of true patriotism and display a becoming Zeal and unshaken attachment to the Interests of these united States. I am confirmed in this opinion from declarations (2) which have been voluntarily made to me by several of the most respectable Characters in this House, that the Letter even as printed in Mr. Rivington's Paper deserves the highest praise with the addition of their wishes that a Copy were sent to the Governor or President of each State. My apprehensions are for the honor & dignity of Congress.  And my present objections amounting to a Protest against the motion are.  Because, it is beneath the dignity of this House to pay attention to such Publications by Printers employed by the Enemy.  Because, the Letter even as published by them contains nothing like Treason, or a design in the party said to be the writer to injure these States or any faithful Citizen of these States.  Because, it would be dangerous and unprecedented to call upon any Member of this House to give up his private correspondencies-or to extort from him his private opinions.  Dangerous, as it would be a direct attempt to deprive the Citizens of these States of that freedom & Liberty ever exercised in Great Britain from whence they have seperated in order to enjoy greater Liberties, and exercised in America even while she was under the dominion of Great Britain. MAY 15,1779  Unprecedented, Because altho many Letters have been published in the Enemy's News Papers of a criminal nature & said to have been written by the Commander in Chief of the Army & by other persons in the service of the United States, Congress have always wisely treated such Publications with contempt.  Dangerous-because it will give encouragement to the Enemy to bribe Secretaries & Servants to steal the private Letters of Members of Congress and other free Citizens of these States, to hold out even genuine Copies of Letters in order to give improper employment to Congress & to divert them from attending to that Circle of business which it is their duty to pursue.  Already Rivington's Publication has employed Congress two whole days without producing any good effect, which time had been assigned for business of the highest importance, to wit,  1. Concluding an Ultimatum for a Treaty of Peace the delay of which has exposed Congress to oblique if not direct rebukes from the Minister Plenepotentiary of France, & which threatens the loss of our National Character. (3)  2d. The Report from the Committee on the Treasury for appreciating the Value of our Paper circulation the neglect of which, is alarming in the highest degree to every unmasked Citizen within & without this House.  3d. An attention to the safety of a Sister State already greatly distressed and now in imminent danger of being subdued by the Enemy from want of timely and sufficient aid.(4)  I might proceed to shew many other important articles necessary for the safety of our Independence, which demand the immed.(5) but these are or ought to be so strongly impressed on the mind of every Member of Congress, as to induce me to think a further enumeration would be an insult both upon the understanding & the fidelity of Congress.(6)  Because, it is below the dignity of Congress to request in writing a Copy of the private correspondence of any Member of this House or of any other free Citizen.(7)  Dangerous and alarming to the States because it will amount to a prohibition to the Delegates writing their private opinions to their respective States.(8)  ""

  Dear Sir, May 15,1779.  As congress cannot possibly comply with your request, the committee can make no report, that will be of any service to you. You cannot have a copy of the report you refer to, nor of the letters which passed between the committees, because, on the late conference and accommodation between congress and the state of Pennsylvania, those proceedings are to cease, and not to be brought again into view or discussion. The whole of the evidence, which relates to the charges on which you are to be tried, is transmitted to general Washington, with the charges, and there is nothing kept back, which you could avail yourself of in your defence. (1) to the resolutions of the report acquitting you of particular charges, they were founded, you know, on ex parte hearing. The committee were obliged to finish the report, and as the executive council, from some difference between their committee and the committee of congress, would not produce the evidence in support of those charges, the committee took up the evidence offered on your part, and passed the resolutions of acquittal; but the executive council and congress having settled the misunderstandings between the committees, and congress not having decided on the report, and the said executive council having offered to produce the evidence before a court martial, the resolutions of the committee can have no operation whatever: when we therefore come to report on your late application, we must report, that your appliction cannot be complied with.

Carolina made a display of upwards of twenty Sail within or nearly within the Bay of Chesepeak on Saturday the 8th of this we learned the 14th since when we have heard nothing more of them, it is probable therefore this appearance was only a manevre calculated for alarming Virginia & thereby stopping the progress of Troops intended for the aid of So Carolina.

When I wrote to your Excellency respecting the Exchange of Citizens in the power of the Enemy, I did not Attend to the Distinction between Civil and military Prisoners: but conceivd your Authority competent in all Cases. (1) cannot think it adviseable to leave the Negociation of the Exchange even of Citizens to Commissaries appointed by the several States: it may be productive of Confusion and Mischief, Nor can there be any possible Inconvenience in consulting the Commander in Chief on the Manner & Terms of such Exchange; while it will at least keep up a Consistency & propriety in our Transactions with the Enemy. It can be no Encroachment on the Civil Authority of any State; because a Citizen in Captivity is treated and considerd as a Prisoner of War, and the whole Business on the part of the Enemy conducted in the Military Line. However it is obvious from your Excellency's Remarks that the Concurrence of the State is necessary to remove all difficulties. I shall prepare a Resolution \""to authorize the Commissioners of Indian Affairs for the northern Department with the Concurrence of the Commander in  MAY 17, 1779  Chief & the executive Authority of the State whose Citizens respectively shall be the Subject of the proposd Exchange, to negociate & Settle the Manner & Terms of the Exchange\"".(2) This will I think answer the present Purpose, & I hope will meet with Approbation.

That it was their interest to do so.  That Congress had known these things above eighteen Months and had taken no notice of them, thence the rapid depreciation of our Paper Currency-if Congress do not immediately take proper measures to prevent it, our Paper Money will be at an end.

  Sir, Phila. 17th May 1779. I had the Honor of yours of the 15th. Instant this Morning and confess that I am not a little astonished at the Contents of it. You profess yourself unwilling to derange a System which is now in exceeding good Order &ca.

  Sir, Philadelphia May 17th 1779 We beg leave to explain to you some difficulties that occur to us in executing the instructions contained in the inclosed paper No. 1 directing the Delegates to inform Congress of the resolutions of assembly respecting Indian purchases. We suppose this must have reference to some other Resolve than the single one next following upon that subject. If Sir, there are any resolves declaring the sense of the Assembly concerning such purchases, and anouncing their invalidity, we pray to be furnished with them.(1) At this time such a declaration seems necessary, as will appear by the paper inclosed No. 2 extracted from a Talk lately delivered to General Washington by some Chiefs of the Delaware nation, and transmitted to Congress by the General.(2) These Indians are come down under the conduct of Colo. George Morgan, who is at once public Agent for Indian affairs in the middle department, and private Agent for the Vandalia company pretending to claim a large territory within the chartered limits of Virginia under purchase from the Indians. As this Talk has come, and the Indians with Colo. Morgan are coming to Congress; we shall endeavor to prevent the success of this Maneuvre. There is some reason to suppose that these Purchasers from the Indians wish to have their right of so doing submitted to the judgement of Congress, and as we conceive that our execution of the 5th resolve in the paper No. 1 will coincide with such views, we have suspended an application to Congress upon the subject, until we can get the further sense of our Constituents thereupon. Lands that are clearly within the chartered limits of a State have been hitherto understood to be, at least, in the preemption of that State; and certainly such purchases would contravene our whole system of laws respecting the mode of acquiring ungranted Lands in Virginia.(3)  We have the honor to be Sir you most obedient servants.

  Sir, Philadelphia 18th May 1779. By the enclosed Copy of a Letter received this Morning from Mr. Holker you will perceive that there is an immediate Demand for a very considerable Quantity of Flour for the Use of the French Squadron at Martinique. This Demand must be complied with.(1) In Order to determine our Abilities the Committee have made the following Estimate.  1st. They suppose that the Northern Department will be supplied from the State of New York.  21y. That the Magazines to the Westward will be sufficient for the Troops destined to act in that Quarter & if they are not it must be owing to Deficiencies in that Country which cannot at present be supplied from other Quarters.  31y. That the Distresses in the Eastern Depart. cannot be so immediately releived from hence as that a great Quantity can with Propriety be destined thither but supposing that by the 1st of July a Part may reach them, then we allow for that Destination 5,000 Barrils which exclusive of the Corn and Rice which may perhaps arrive, will contain 1,120,000 Rations. From the first Day of July to the 20th Day of Octr., by which Period it is to be hoped that the new Crop will be at Market to supply that Demand, is 112 Days so that this Quantity will furnish 10,000 Rations daily.  41y. That the Consumption of the Troops from Byram to Potowmack Rivers, exclusive of the northern and western Dept. will not exceed 25,000 Rations daily which is per Month 750,000 lbs of Bread and allowing only 224 lbs of Bread to the Barril of Flour is 3,348 Barrils monthly. From the last day of May to the last day of October is five Months making 16,740 Barrils but we allow for Deficiencies 260 Barrils and state the whole Demand at 17,000.  51y. That the marine Committee for their Demands may want 3,000 Barrils which for six Months will amount to 500 per Month and allowing 200 lbs. of hard Bread to the Barril of Flour is Monthly 100,000 Rations or daily 3,333 Rations.  6thly. That by Ayletts Returns it appears that the Convention Troops can be supplied in that Quarter. Wherefore the Account stands thus.  Eastern Department 5,000 Barrils Grand Army & Posts 17,000 Marine Committee 3,000 Squadron at Martinique 12,000 Total Demand 37,000 MAY 18, 1779  By Blaine's Return of the 12th Instant deducting what is for the western Expedition there appears to be a Remainder of 8,424 tho perhaps there may be more as the Return is much couched in round Numbers. And for the same Reason there may be more than the 16,755 Bushels of Wheat which however at six Bushels to the Barril will contain 2,792 1/2 Barrils amountaining in the whole to 11,216 1/2 Barrils.  By Aylett's Return to February last there are 959 Barrils and 9,626 Bushels of Wheat equal as above to 1,604 Barrils, in the whole 2,563 Barrils of which we allow one half to have been already expended the Remainder is 1,281 1/2 and by his last Return there appears to be a moral Certainty of 4,460 Barrils more in his Hands which with the former Quantity is 5,741 I/2.  By Governor Johnson's last Letters the Committee expect from Maryland 10,000 Barrils. Wherefore the Account stands thus.  Blaines's Returns 11,216 1/2 Barrils Ayletts Returns 5,741 t/2 Maryland 10,000 Deficiency 10,042 Total 37,000 No Allowance is made in this Calculation for what may be in the Hands of the issuing Commissary beyond the Supplies of the current Month. And on the whole it appears that only 10,000 Barrils remain to be purchased before the next Harvest which seems to promise plentifully.  By the Returns of Salt it appears that 20,000 Bushels of it may be easily spared and the Committee have good Reason to beleive that by giving two Bushels of Salt for a Barril of Flour in Part of the Pay the necessary Quantity may easily be obtained and therefore recommend it to you to pursue that Measure in the most prudent Manner and at the same Time to reduce if possible the Price of Flour which may we think be done and in that Case there is but little Doubt that the Quantity will be increased by drawing it from the Hands of Engrossers who now expect to make an Advantage by the public Wants. One Means of reducing the Price is to divide the whole Quantity among your several Purchasers and limit the Times at which it is to be delivered. Whether a Limitation of Price will be expedient we cannot so readily determine but incline to think that it would.

The Enemy's Army lies on one Side of the Savanah River & ours on the other, the Governor of South Carolina is raising Militia to reinforce our Army, & they are in hopes they Shall be able to repel the Enemy & drive them out of Georgia, 'tis Said they are very Sickly.

7228,dg012555,1779,Meriwether Smith s Speech in Congress,"""Meriwether Smith's Speech in Congress
  Mr. President, Tuesday, 18th May 1779. It gives me real Concern to find that Mr. Laurens, a Delegate from the State of South Carolina, considers the Motion I made on Friday  last (1) as an Attempt \""irregular unprecedented & full of dangerous Consequences- derogatory to the Honor & Dignity of Congress & alarming to the free & independent Citizens of these united States.\"" I conceive it to be the Duty of every Member of Congress to receive Information, & to communicate it to Congress, of the Venality, Peculation & Fraud of any of its Members, or of other Persons employed in the public Service. If the Information leads to the Investigation of Truth, it is worthy of Notice and should be attended to. The Contents of the Letter alluded to in the Information I gave, the Manner in which it was published & the Probability that a Letter directed to the Governor of Georgia, might have fallen into the Hands of the Enemy, in Georgia; did, in my Opinion, require the Attention of Congress & of all the free & independent Citizens of these united States; since the Honor of the one & the Interest of the other demanded an Inquiry concerning the Truth of the Contents. The Publisher in this Instance could not be called upon to justify the Publication, either by Congress or Mr. Laurens, because he was not within the Line of their Power: But Mr. Laurens might have refuted the Publication by a bare Denial of the Authenticity of the Letter; which Justice to Congress & his own Honor required if the Letter published was not genuine. In my Opinion, therefore, there was no Impropriety in the Motion for demanding of Mr. Laurens whether he had written the Letter of which that Publication was said to be a Copy. I am sure the demanding of a Person whether he was the Author of a letter published in a Newspaper was not unprecedented even in this House. But Mr. Laurens could not be compelled to give Evidence against himself, or even to answer the Question. A Regard to Truth & his own Honor were the only Considerations which could oblige  MAY 18, 1779  him to answer any Question. The Motion, therefore, could not be \""full of dangerous Consequences,\"" nor could it be \""alarming to the free and independent Citizens of these united States\"" unless Mr. Laurens & the free & independent Citizens of these united States should be of Opinion that Truth & Honor ought not to influence the Conduct of Men. If Mr. Laurens has discovered those Scenes of Venality, Peculation & Fraud, which are mentioned in the Letter alluded to, or if he was warrented to say what is therein expressed, he ought indeed to have rejoiced that an Opportunity was given him to unfold them, & thereby to have been instrumental in bringing to Punishment the Authors of such Mischiefs to the Public. But, Mr. Laurens has charged me openly in Congress, with having attempted what was \""irregular, unprecedented & full of dangerous Consequences- derogatory to the Honor & Dignity of Congress, & alarming to the free and independent Citizens of these united States.\"" And he has said that he rejoices \""at the Wisdom displayed by Congress in over-ruling the ATTEMPT.\"" This charge is contained in a written Paper, which he read in his Place and desir'd might be entred upon the Journals of Congress. It hath been received and is entered upon the Journal by order of Congress. Without calling upon Congress for that Protection against personal Insult, to which every Member is entitled whilst he is performing his Duty in this House, and a consequent Reparation of the Breach of Privilege; I demanded of Congress the Justice due to my Honor,-that the Sense of Congress might be expressed whether the Motion I had made was of such a Nature as Mr. Laurens had declared, and I thought myself intitled to Satisfaction on this Point, as Congress had received the implied Thanks of Mr. Laurens for the wisdom displayed in over-ruling the ATTEMPT. Congress has not been pleased to answer the Question; but hath adopted a Resolution, which, in my Opinion, countenances the Charge; as it apologizes for having admitted the Declaration to Record, & leaves it in full Force against me. A Mode of Proceeding which, if it shall be conclusive in this Case, I fear, will impeach the Candor if not the Justice of Congress. I therefore, as well out of Regard to the Dignity of Congress as to my own Honor, repeat my Request that Congress will explicitly declare whether it be their Opinion that the Motion which I made on Friday last was \""full of dangerous Consequences-derogatory to the Honor & Dignity of Congress & alarming to the free & independent Citizens of these united States.\"" and having indulged Mr. Laurens with entering his address upon the Journals of Congress, I hope Congress will allow me equal Justice & allow me the same Indulgence, by entring this Address upon the Journal of Congress.(2)  Meriwether Smith ""

  19 May [1779] When the Question to fill up the same Blank was put (40 Million having been moved by Gov Morris) Mr. Drayton offered a motion for recommending to the States to tax their respective constituents in as high an Amount as their circumstances would bear-I said, I would wish to second that Motion if it were practicable because it would apply extremely well to the circumstances of our State, but I apprehended we could not proceed in that indefinite mode, & I believed my Colleague was not in the secret-alluding to a design of drawing in Gentn. to a conduct MAY 19, 1 779  which should appear to be contradictory, by combating against a high Tax & insisting upon the fisheries as an Ultimatum for Peace, and there upon I put queries to Mr. Ellery. \""If you are in such circumstances as will not admit of Taxation adequate to lessening the quantity of Paper Money now abroad, how can you reconcile your demand for the Fishery as an Ultimatum-if you are not in circumstances for continuing the War-you will be told your ultimatum should be moderate.[\""]  A Motion was presently made by Mr. Dickinson for filling the blank with 60 Million. My Colleague who had formerly confessed his incapacity & left to me to determine even on 30 Million having received light by an out of door conference with two or three of the party, voted not only without consulting, but in direct opposition to me for 60 Million. This being negatived & 45 Million moved, he also voted for that Sum in opposition to me.  The circumstances of So Carolina are such as called upon us to reflect maturely on the subject. I had previously called Mr. Drayton out of Congress into the Court Room & delivered my opinion candidly on the subject-expressed my apprehensions that the burthen would be too much at this time for So Carolina, demonstrated the disadvantages she lay under by comparing the prices of her Staples with those of Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, &c. I said I was in favor of taxing as highly as could be borne & that respecting myself I would wish to pay off now all my Taxes for two Years to come &c. &c.  He replied, \""all that could be said was that if we could not pay it we (1) could not pay it\"" & then voted as I have said & as the Journal will shew. (2)  ""

  Gentlemen . May 20th 1779 Since ours of the 4th instant we are favoured with yours of the 28th ultimo (1) whereby we find there is reason to conclude that Captain Hopkins has violated his Orders by returning into Port when he should have continued to Cruize, (2) and by not sending the Prizes he took into the nearest Port, and we find also that Captain Olney (3) has acted contradictory to your Orders by Comeing up to Boston when you had expressly required him to remain with his Ship in Nantasket road. We now direct that you immediately order a Court of Inquiry to inquire into the Conduct of those Two commanders during their late Cruize, and afterward if necessary a Court Martial. If you find the prosecution of that business will produce any delay in getting the Ships again to Sea, it is our desire that you suspend the said Commanders and put in others and in that case we recommend Captain Saltonstal and Captain Rathbourne to be appointed in their room .(4) We deem it highly necessary for the good of the Service that the orders of your Board should be obeyed by all Officers of the Navy under your direction and we desire that you will cause Courts of enquiry to be held when it is your Opinion the good of the Service requires it on the conduct of such Officers as may disobey your Orders or in any other manner may misbehave. We highly disaprove of Captain Hopkins sending an Officer to this place with A Letter contrary to the Orders of your Board, which disobedience of Orders in this as well as in other instances were unknown to us when we wrote him A Letter of approbation; (5) and we consider it very injurious to the service for the officers to get themselves appointed Agents for their Men as well as dishonorable to such Officers. Lieutenant Morran late of the Brigantine General Gates has arrived here in the Frigate Deane from Martinico where he was put on board that vessel under arrest by Captain Waters. We are unacquainted with the cause of his arrest, and therefore desire you will order Captain Waters to give in his charge with proper proofs, which please to send forward to us. The frigate Confederacy has arrived here and the Schooner Hannah & Mary which last vessel we have ordered to be laded and despatched back to your Port.  MAY 20, 1779  We have lately had sufficient reason to lay asside the expedition intended Against the enemys force on the Coast of Georgia; and the service the frigate Providence was intended for is supplied by another Ship- therefore it is now our intention to place our collected Naval force in such a manner as to accomplish the double purpose of intercepting the enemies outward bound Transports for New York from Great Britain and Ireland & the homeward bound west India Ships, but If the Providence & Ranger should be ready for Sea more than a fortnight before the other Ships- that then you order those Ships to proceed to Cruize for the above purpose, marking out to them their Cruizing ground in such manner, as there may be the greatest possible certainty of being joined by the other Ships as soon as they shall be ready.  You will use all possible diligence in getting the other Ships ready least that the two that Sails first should be exposed to Danger before they are joined.

  Sir, Philadelphia May 20th 1779 We have seen a paper signed by several of the officers of the Continental Troops raised by the State, over which you preside, and which we have the honor to represent in Congress. And we deem it a duty we owe to these, our brave and meritorious fellow Citizens, to declare our sense of the measure which they have adopted. (1)  The grievances of which they complain we are convinced press them with difficulties much more severe than they have expressed-and the prices of necessaries which they have stated are far from being exaggerated; they are, in truth below what are now current, the money being greatly depreciated since the date of their memorial. The hopes of attracting the attention of their Country, so as to obtain effectual provision against their present distress and for future support after peace shall be restored to their Country, appear to us extremely reasonable, and we persuade ourselves they are not ill founded.  We have that confidence in the wisdom justice and liberality of our Country, which permits us not to doubt that they will pay due attention to our fellow Citizens, who have opposed their bosoms to the swords of our Enemies-who have steadily persevered in exerting their Courage and talents for their Country, under the pressure of every want, and every severe calamity, which can wound the human senses and embitter human life.  And we beg Sir, to offer our wishes, that this subject may be considered, by the General Assembly, as of the highest importance, and deserving their most early attention. Measures, in principle similar to this taken by the officers of our Troops, have been taken by the officers of several other States; and we are happy in observing, that Ours have, in their address to the General Assembly, displayed a modesty, which we could wish not to have been singular, but which in Justice to them, we are obliged to declare to be so, as far as we have had an opportunity of remarking.  Their complaints are, and indeed always have been less loud, and importunate than those of any others; altho it must be owned their sufferings have been greater and their merit not less than those of any other Corps. This circumstance in our Opinion the better entitles them to an early and generous attention.  It may be thought that such redress as the Officers pray for ought more properly to be administered by Congress, but experience has proved that  MAY 20, 1 779  present provision can more conveniently and effectually be made by the states; and it is not quite clear, whether agreeable to the true genius of a Federal Republic, the future provision for the military ought to be made by, and at the will of the Magistrate who must have the supreme united executive power.  But what makes the immediate interposition of the states necessary is, that Congress have not time to apply the remedy so early as the inconvenience demands.  We venture to press our Country not only in favor of the application of our Officers, but also in favor of our fellow Citizens who are in the Ranks. We doubt not the Assembly will readily see the propriety of their being furnished with present comfortable subsistence, and that such future provision be made, as will make it their inclination to become useful Citizens in a peaceful Community.

If further Emissions are Stopt, the currency will probably fix at a proper rate in proportion to the Quantity & become Stable, which perhaps is as much as may be expected while the war continues, unless a foreign loan Should be obtained which I Should not be very fond of if we can do without it.

  My Dear Sir, Philadelphia the 21st May 1779 My last I think was the 11th inst (1) since which I have not been favored with any of Yours. I have been some time in expectation of a Colleague to supply the place of Mr. Frost, who I suppose must have been at home some weeks. My Task is really arduous, but my anxiety to see a determination of some important matters now under consideration prevents my pressing a speedy relief.  The State of the currency is truely deplorable, but not so alarming in my judgment as the failure of public Virtue, the former may possibly be assisted by human means, but we must depend on him who alone can control the hearts of men to establish the latter. We are now about trying once more what can be done to save the sinking credit of the money, the prevailing Opinion is that nothing will do but (I was going to say) excessive Taxes, but I will soften the epithet, & adopt the words very high if a sufficiency can be raised by Taxes to support the war, farther emissions will be unnecessary, this is part of the plan now under consideration, a consequent Resolution past this day to raise 45,000,000 to be paid in by the 1st of Jany. I must suspend giving you my Opinion of this measure for the present, let it suffice to say there was a great Majority in favor of the question, & but a small Majority against the Question for 60,000,000 this is a bold Political stroke, and I hope will be carried into effect, as to all appearance nothing else can save us from destruction, the People in this MAY 21, 1779  part of the Country are every where clamerous for heavy Taxes, the greatest difficulty appears to me is, the levying it on the proper persons, if the whole sum could be drawn from those speculating miscreants, who have been sucking the Blood of their country, it would be a most happy circumstance and I hope the assessors will be particularly attentive to those people, He who increases in wealth in such times as the present, must be an enemy to his Country, be his pretentions what they may. If the Connecticut mode of collecting Taxes was adobted the business would be much facilitated; In that State five or six Taxes are collected in a Year by that means they collect very large sums without produceing the least uneasiness among the people. If the people are duely impress'd with the advantages they will derive from paying in their money while it is at the present low state they certainly will do it with chearfulness. Spirited measures with the Property of the fugitives, as well as with the persons of the resident, enemies to the Revolution, would in my humble Opinion have an exceeding good effect, at this particular Crisis.  The Enemy seem determined to carry on a predatory war agreeable to the threats held up in the British Commissioners Proclamation last Summer. Their Conduct in Virginia is an evidence of this, for the particulars I must beg leave to refer you to the new papers. Time only can inform us of the events of the present Campaign, but this we may be assured of, that nothing is so likely to give us success as vigorous & decisive measures both in Council & in the Field. A Mr. Hamilton Govr of Detroit is taken prisoner (by Major Clark of Virginia) with his Garrison at a post he held on the Ohio, (2) this vipers nest has been exceedingly troublesome to our frontiers, Whether our troubles in that quarter will be soon ended, depends on the success of the expedition into that Country under the Command of Genl Sullivan. Whether we shall have any naval assistance from our ally (depends in my judgment) on the Chapter of accidents but this is not the Opinion of many others; but Mum!  I want every State in the Union to feel the importance of Sovereignty, & I wish the United States were fully sensible of their importance among the powers of the Earth; we should then under Heaven depend on our own strength, & banish from among us every Idea of servility, which now like the Tares among the wheat, prevents the growth of that virtuous republican pride so essential to the happiness of America. You have several times mentioned to me the Flagg that was detained by order of Congress & as I know the importunity of the people must be very troublesome I heartily wish Congress could be prevailed on to decide on that matter but from various causes nothing has Yet been done 'tho several reports have been made & recommitted, on the whole I think it will be best for the executive authority of the State to act their own judgment in that matter.

  Dear General. Philadelphia 22d May 1779 In answer to your favour of the 27th Ulto, please to accept my thanks for that friendly & good letter, in which I must not Overlook your pious wish for the Wisdom & Integrity of Congress. Neither Niagara nor Detroit are in contemplation, the Seneca Indians & their connexions whether Tories or others, are I presume the only present object of our Arms to the North. Genl. Sullivans movements & Operations will probably give the Enemy an Opportunity either to elude or by their Canadian Assistance to Overcome him-we must hope the best, the Enterprise being absolutely necessary, for with how much propriety soever Peace may be made with any other tribe who shall offer it, the arrogance & barbarous mischiefs of the former cannot be dispenced with, nor is retaliation the only thing in view, but the prevention of much greater evils than those already effected which we cannot doubt under the direction of Butler or some other person of note, our enemies have in immediate contemplation. Sullivan has asked of Congress two Extra Aids DeCamp for the Campaign, not yet granted nor ought they to be. (1)  The Packet from France to which you alude brought us the news of the birth of a Princes of that Nation under the hand of the King! Shortly after, we received an intimation from the Minister of the intended or expected return of the Count DeEstaing to our Coasts for important purposes, taking Georgia & South Carolina in his way. (Secrecy enjoined by Congress) latterly by a letter from Mr. Bingham an Agent at Martinique we have reason to doubt the coming of the Count. (2) I wish I cou'd give you a more favourable relation of sudden & vigorous exertions in our House for recovering the expiring credit of our Money and in the dispatch of our foreign affairs, whereon depends the Political life of America. Sometimes our efforts point that way & promise a happy progress in the plainest path that ever pure necessity pointed out to man, but anon a diversion is made, new & impertinent matter thrown on the Anvil under Specious Colourings tending at least to Such delay as may be fatal; thus like the Scale of the beam we rise & fall. The prices & rise of things here are truly allarm- MAY 22, 1779  ing. The virtuous Mob (25th May) (3) are now begining to appear & perhaps may in some degree correct these errors which the inattention of Others have Suffered to grow to the present enormous heighth.  Portsmouth & Suffolk in Virginia are laid in Ashes & some considerable loss of Publick & private Stores, Shiping &c must be Sustained at those Ports. The hostile Steps of the Enemy are Said to be marked rather with the barbarities & Cruelties, than the National & known rules of War. I am of Opinion they intend no long Stay where they now are, being under three thousand or perhaps under two in number, but will set out for the South, or attempt the Same business at Baltimore. The Soldiers on furlough and new recruits intended for the Southern Army joined to the Militia will we expect Soon drive them from Virginia.  Dr. Brown is not yet returned to this place. I presume Major Armstrong has Shewn you a paragraph in my last to him by Mr. Newcome, in regard of your letter of Cristmas last to Mr. Jay.(4)  I am dear General with every Cordial Wish, and Respectful Compliments to yr Lady & Family, Your Affectionate friend & Humbe.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia, 22d May, 1779. I promised myself the satisfaction of receiving letters from some of my friends by the express who brought the distressing account of the enemy's success at Portsmouth, (1) but I have not recd. a letter from Virginia since my arrival here, except from Mrs. Fleming.  I am apprehensive the enemy will commit great ravages before an effectual check can be given to their progress, as the dispersed situation of our militia, & their want of arms & accoutrements, will greatly retard their operations, be them ever so spirited & active.  From the best observations I have been able to make, our great concerns wear a very gloomy aspect, owing principally to the rapid and excessive depreciation of our money, which is almost beyond conception; and the misfortune is, the mischief is daily increasing, and no man can see where it will stop; and I am persuaded if something effectual is not speedily done, it will in a short time cease to be current at all. Should that happen, the disbanding our army must inevitably be the consequence. When I came here, the 27th of April, the difference between paper & gold was sixteen for one, and I was yesterday told by a member of congress that £75 a peice is now given for half Joes. Provisions, and all kinds of goods rise in proportion to the depreciation of the paper money. Add to all this that our credit with foreigners is sinking a pace, and the enemy in possession of most of our ports to the southward of Rhode Island; which will consequently increase the difficulty of procuring cloaths for our soldiers, & military stores, should the war be continued, which is a thing not at all improbable, but will, in my apprehension, depend in a great measure on Congress.  I am of opinion the enemy have pretty well lost sight of conquering America by arms; for instead of drawing their force to a point, and making an effort against our grand army, it seems to be their plan to carry on a kind of piratical war in detached parties, by burning our towns, plundering our sea coasts, & distressing individuals; besides endeavouring, by every artifice in their power, to destroy the little credit, left, of our paper money, to sow dissentions, & create divisions among us, and, if possible, to wean a party from the alliance with France-and, that being effected, to offer independence to America on her entering into a treaty, offensive & defensive with G. Britain. These are my conjectures-whether well or ill founded, time perhaps may discover.  Genl. Thompson, and several other officers of rank, are just arriv'd from N. York on parole. The enemy there are about 7000 strong, including American recruits, of which they have a great proportion. They have recd. no reinforcements from Europe this spring.  I think we have little to fear but from the depreciation of our money; and from that source we have, in my opinion, much to fear. There are MAY 22, 1 779  between 130 & 140 millions of dollars now in circulation; and congress, to make one bold effort to restore its sinking credit, yesterday, passed an act to call on the states for their respective quotas of 45 millions of dollars, by the first day of next January; and this (if it can be effected) will not answer the end, without the aid of a foreign loan; for unless some such measure can be speedily adopted, the emissions between this and the first day of January, must greatly exceed 45 millions of dollars. The demand appears large, & doubtless it is so; but the very critical situation of our affairs seems to make it not only expedient, but absolutely necessary; and I am hopeful a plentiful crop this year will enable our people to pay it without making sale of much of their property, besides the produce of their lands, & many will pay it with less than a fourth of that produce. On those who have no land it will fall the lightest. An address from congress to the people of each state, shewing the situation of their affairs, & the necessity for the measure, will accompany the requisition.(2) What cannot be raised by taxes must, I suppose, be borrowed; but in my opinion, the less of the latter the better. I believe most of the states to the northward of Virginia will raise their whole proportion by taxes; and if Virginia (instead of laying high taxes, now the produce of her lands are high) should give too much into the scheme of borrowing, she will have the greatest part of her enormous debt to pay with interest, when (the money having in a great measure recovered it's credit) her commodities will have fallen many hundred per cent; and the consequence will be that your speculating harpies, who have large sums of money in their hands, will carefully lay it up, as soon as they see its credit established, to purchase your lands & negroes at an under value.  Our misfortune is, that the bulk of the people, thro'out the states, seem to have lost sight of the great object for which we had recourse to arms, and to have turned their thoughts soley to accumulating ideal wealth, and preying upon the necessities of their fellow citizens.  I have heard much, but seen very little, of patriotism & public virtue: If there is any remains of it in America, this is the season for calling it forth, and for it's utmost exertions.  France has done generous things for us, to which she was not bound by treaty, and if we will but be firm & united, all may yet be well.  It is of the utmost consequence that the confederation be speedily ratified. It would in a great degree give force & energy to the proceedings of congress, and defeat the hope our enemy entertains of dividing us. Maryland is the only state that now refuses to accede tho' many of the states have acceded on condition that all the rest come into the confederation. The Maryland delegates, a few days ago, delivered in, to congress, an instruction from their assembly on the subject; and a very extraordinary, indecent performance it is. A copy will be sent by the express to our assembly for their consideration, and I hope we shall be favoured with a proper comment upon it.(3)  MAY 22, 1779  I am afraid I have trespassed on your patience by dwelling on so melancholy a subject, but I thought it necessary to say something on what appears to me to be the state of our affairs, and having entered on the subject, could not well say less. When I speak of facts, what I say I know to be true-the rest are mere conjectures I have ventured to make from particular circumstances which have occurred.  We are just informed, by report, of some horrid depredations of the enemy, which, if true, I hope will rouse the spirit of our people, as their conduct in 76 did that of the people of Jersey.  We have a report, from different quarters, that colo. G.R. Clarke has made prisoner the Governor of Detroit (one Hamilton) with about 3[ ] privates, who are now on their way to Wmsburgh.(4)  I am with great esteem, Dr Sr. Yr. affect. friend & servt,  Wm.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia 22 May 1779. I have now the Pleasure of transmitting you a Copy of certain Resolutions moved in Congress this morning respecting the pretended State of Vermont. (1) They were introduced by Mr. Morris with a proper prefatory Speech. On Saturday next the House will be resolved into a Committee of the whole to take them into Consideration. What may be their Fate is uncertain, tho I am by no means without Hopes of Success. They are temperate & founded on plain Principles. Opposition will hence be more difficult, and their Defence more certain. The Yeas and Nays shall be called on every Question respecting them; and I will furnish you with a minute Detail of the Proceedings of Congress in every stage of the Debates on the Subject. The Delays attending this Business have been unavoidable, and rather unpleasant than prejudicial. It will now be pressed forward, and you may rely on our utmost Exertions and Care.

Reprinted from Clinton, Papers (Hastings), 4:840-41.  1 This day Gouverneur Morris introduced a motion concerning New York's controversy with the Vermont separatists, calling for congressional endorsement of the principle that no part of a state could \""separate therefrom, and become independent thereon, without the express consent and approbation of such state,\"" and recommending \""to the inhabitants of the said pretended State of Vermont, to return peaceably to their former jurisdictions\"" while Congress examined their grievances. JCC, 14:631-33. Congress thereupon resolved to take up Morris' proposal in committee of the whole on May 29.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia May 22. 1779 I have paid due attention to your favor of April the 21st., and I believe there would have been no difficulty in obtaining what is desired for Baron de Geismar (1) had not the enemy created the difficulties that do exist. They absolutely refuse to admit partial exchanges, and they have lately proposed such unfair terms for general exchange that nothing can be done in either of these ways. They will not allow one of our Officers to come out on parole, if like permission be granted to one of theirs, as appeared in the case of Major de Passeren (2) of the Regiment of Hesse Hanau. Upon consideration of this matter with your friend Mr. Peters, who is one of the Board of War, we conclude the way to put this matter into the best train will be for the Baron to apply to the British Commander in Chief for this parole exchange, and write to Gen. Kniphausen to support the request. That these letters be sent here to the Board of War, and they will immediately forward them thro the Commissary of Prisoners expressing their willingness to gratify the Baron. An objection is raised here to gratifying this Officer without receiving something like an equiv- MAY 22, 1779  alent from the enemy, as tending to encourage their obstinacy in refusing a general exchange on terms of fair equality, by which our captive Officers [suffer?].  We have no news here but what comes from Virginia.

Many of your friends are of opinion that it will be for your honor that you should be called here in order to bring {Deane} to justice. Should this be the resolution, I entreat you to spare no pains in collecting the most authentic proofs, for I am very certain that there has been so much misconduct and {wicked traffic} with the {public money} That you will do honor to yourself and serve your country by breaking up this bad man and his very bad connections.

Altho the plan for recal should not finally be carried, yet your friends are of opinion that the violence & wickedness of your enemies is such, that   they think it will be wise in you, to take the first favorable opportunity to resign, or rather ask leave to do so. I before mentioned and again repeat my earnest wish, for I think it indispensable that when you come you bring every material for making the fairest and fullest settlement of the expenditure of such pub. money as has passed thro you, or been entrusted to your care. It will by no means be proper for one of us to endeavor to shelter ourselves, as some bad men do, under a thousand delusive pretexts for not settling accounts and demonstrating the rectitude of our conduct.

  Dear General Philadela. May 23d 1779. We had the Honor of a Letter from his Excellency the Governor of Maryland last night, by express, dated on the 20th Inst. (1) The Devastation and cruelties hourly committed by the Enemy in Virginia, and the probability of their acting the same part in Maryland, unless timely prevented, has justly alarmed the people of that State. We lament that the Army under the Command of your Excellency does not admit of a Detachment from the Maryland Troops. Were it possible to head the Malitia by a small Body of regular Troops, they would turn out with more alacrity and act with greater vigour thus incorporated, than alone. It may indeed happen, that the present views and progress of the Enemy may render any extensive preparations for Defence in Maryland unnecessary. But the Destruction of Portsmouth and Suffolk joined to the Threats of the Enemy are sufficient to induce a belief in the minds of the Citizens of Annapolis and Baltimore, that their Cities are not safe unless defended by superior force. We have no accurate knowledge of the strength of your Army, nor any precise Ideas of your Excellencys present plans of operation, and MAY 23, 1779  therefore tho' we, as individuals and Citizens of the State of Maryland wish, yet we do not look for any immediate aid from the main Army. Such as is consistent with the good of the whole, should the State be actually invaded, we know we shall receive. The principal Design of our writing to you at this time, is to inform your Excellency of the desire of the Governor of Maryland, to have Genl. Gist sent down to Baltimore to head the Militia. He is a native of that place, has considerable weight with the Militia and will be of much Service if that City is attacked. Should the State be invaded, we cannot help suggesting in addition to the request of the Governor, considering the inexperience of Militia officers in general, that one or two other regular officers would also be found extensively useful, if the state of the Maryland Troops will admit of it, but the propriety of this step we leave altogether to your Excellency and have the Honor to be, with the most cordial affection, your Excellency obedt & hble Servts.

  Dear Sir, Phila. May 24th. 1779. Your favor of the 10th I have received. I believe from the different movements of the Enemy in Virga & Georgia, that it never was their intention to acknowledge our independence before they had risked another Campaign; And that we have been under a delusion in expecting it. Appearances it is true, were much in our favor, and I wish Congress had determined with precision on their Ultimatum in February, but this business is still under discussion. What the result may be will be known it is probable in 8 or 10 days? I do not mean to censure Congress, it may turn out that Congress has deliberated with wisdom, and that time will evince its measures to have been wise and justifiable.  I think you are generous in offering to pay 1/ Sterling for every Paper Dollar emitted. I believe a Loan abroad for the buying Arms Cloathing &c. for our Soldiers might be obtained, but the risk of their getting safe to hand is very great.  Your Questions about Money, & the faith of the Public are striking, and your reasoning thereon unanswerable. Inclosed you have a list of the Votes as they were taken on the Question for the recall of Doct. Lee, by which you will observe a great Majority of Voters for the affirmative, tho it was trick & Tie with the States. This Vote in my opinion ought not to have transpired but some Member of Congress published it in the Newspapers.  Mr. C. has been much censured for his Attack upon the Senate, as well as for his Speculations.(1) I have been informed by Major Mercer that C. denied to him that he speculated in Flour, and S. Adams informed me before Mr Henry that he never said, or heard that Mr. Tilghman & Mr. Carroll, or either of them, had proposed to send to Genl Howe when in  MAY 24, 1779  Jersey to know what terms he had to offer. (2) Mr Deane I am told, does not incline to go into a dispute with Payne till his business with Congress is setled.  You may depend upon the information I gave you as to Emissions of Paper Bills by Congress being just. If I can procure in time from the Treasury board an exact account so as to enclose it to you by this Post I will do it, But Ten Millions in addn. have been ordered to be struck by Congress since the date of my Letter, and if the Money depreciates in proportion to what it has done in this place for three weeks past, God only knows what will be the consequence. It is the Enemys last hope and I wish it may not be a Sheet Anchor to them. Congress are endeavoring to counteract them, but I fear the measure about to be recommended to the different States for this purpose will not be adopted to the extent of the recommendation. I am very glad that your Daughter received benefit from the Trip over the Bay. I have sent 2 pair of her shoes by an Express that came to us from our Governor.  Pray could your Son (3) be prevailed upon to go to the Court of Spain. He would render America more Service at this time by going thither, than any man in it. He might take Mrs. Carroll & little Polly with him, it would probably be of service to them both-And I think a protection might be obtained. How glorious would it be for him to procure peace for America. I know that one great objection that he would make to going Ambassador would be, that he could not leave you, But I hope you will use your influence with him to undertake the Voyage should he be appointed to this important trust.  We have nothing New from Europe or the West Indias-We hourly expect important intelligence. With my best respects to Mrs. Darnall.  I am Dear Sir, Your Obedient Servt,  Daniel of St. Thos Jenifer [P.S.] A Mob is just now collecting for the purpose of lowering prices of Goods & Provisions and I believe it will be formidable-they have sent eight persons to Prison already.(4) Some Speculators have applyed for Protection to the Exct. Council who have refused it to them, what this will End in I do not know but many people are greatly alarmed. If there is a head to this body the consequences may be fatal to some persons, but if there is not it will soon disperse as has general been the case of a body collected in a hurry.  The Secretary has disappointed me in Copying the Vote I promised to send you tho' its probable you may have seen it before this time. Maryland was Unanimous for the recall & so was Virga. & N.C.(5)  ""

  Dear Sir Philadelphia May 24th. 1779. I have the pleasure of Your Excellencys favor of the 20st (1)-- - Congress have not received any later intelligence than what you have communicated, which I am really surprized at, considering the distress that the inhabitants of the Lower part of Virga. must be in.  I am too sensible, not to feel the force of your observation respecting Censure-many are ready to find fault after events happen, that contribute very little towards preventing misfortunes. We have perhaps been overgenerous in assisting the Continent-the day may come when past Services will be forgotten-nay it is at hand-however, we have the pleasure of reflecting, that if we have erred, it has been from motives both honorable and laudable. It appears to me if an attack is made on Annapolis with a considerable Force, that it cannot be defended. Baltimore perhaps may, as there will be time for the back people to come to its aid.  Your express arrived I am told at this place on Saturday night. I did not know till a few hours ago that he waited for an Answer-the Delegates from Maryland sent off a Continental rider to General Washington yesterday Morning being Sunday with Your Excellency Letter, & pressed him to send General Guist to command the Maryland Militia with any other Officer, or assistance that he might think proper to afford an State-I expect that the rider will return time enough for us to write you by the Post what may be expected from that Quarter.(2)  Congress have but 602 stand of Arms at this place, & those not fit for immediate use. The board of War is directed to get them repaired & to deliver them to our Order-it will take some days before this can be done-but you may depend they shall be forwarded with all possible dispatch. The Americans are the most supine people in the Universe, they seldom see danger till it is past-if we are not roused from our Lethargy we shall be undone-Arms, Amunition &c. all go to the Northern States-15000 Continental Blankets are lately arrived in their Ports. I see very plainly, that the Southern States will be obliged to shift for them MAY 24, 1779  selves. We got our Instructions from the Genl Assembly Entered on the Journals last Friday. They are said to be well drawn by good Judges- and I hope will have weight, several causes seem to conspire to engage greater attention to be paid to our Declarations than we have hitherto experienced. Connecticut is now I am told by Sherman disposed to allow Congress to settle the dispute about the Backlands. That State has empowered its Delegates to confederate with the other States, but on the express Condition that Maryland shall have the power at anytime hereafter to accede to the confederation on equal terms with the other States. The 800,000 Dollars were sent off last Monday,(3) and I hope are before this came to hand safe.  The Great Dominion of Virga. surely can repel 2000 Men-more than that Number were not embarked at New York. Speculation here has arrived to such a height and prices in three weeks encreased 100 Per Ct. This has made those Vermin the Speculators become the object of resentment, and a Mob has assembled to regulate prices-what will be the issue God knows. They are now parading-if they have a head I believe this business will be of service, if they have not one, they will soon disperse as all tumultuous assemblys have done, that have not had a leader. Enclosed you have a Copy of one of their printed handbills. (4) Congress have this day resolved to retaliate on the Enemy as well for murders committed on French Subjects as those on the Subjects of the United States.(5)  ""

  Monday 24th May 1779. A Letter from Silas Deane was read in Congress (1)-the contents of this Letter are, in my opinion, extremely indecent & disrespectful & I am persuaded no Assembly of Representatives in America would admit a similar address to them to pass without severe censures upon the author-my opinion is supported by the declarations which were made by some who act as if they were particular friends of Mr. Deane-these Gentlemen MAY 24, 1 779  expressed their apprehensions of bringing the Letter on the Journals. When a demand was made for yeas and nays on a question arising from debates relative to the Letter-they said it would bring the Letter on the Journal & surely Gentlemen would not wish to see such a Letter on the Journal-the President particularly said this & other Gentl delivered similar sentiments, & the demand for Ys & Ns was withdrawn.  Mr. Burke, said he had prepared a motion which would try Gentlemen & discover whether they were in earnest or not & read the followg (2) which I immediately seconded & said I did so most heartily, that my sole aim was justice to the Public as well as to individuals, that whether Mr. Deane should be found to be innocent or criminal the conduct of Congress could not escape some blame for having so long detained Mr. Deane- that this was not a new Idea, I had signified my sentiments so long since as August last, which I had lately disclosed by shewing Copy of a Letter to the President, the President nodded assent.  Mr. Penn said he did not like the words as soon as he conveniently can. I proposed as an amendment, that Mr. Lee should be required to return to America forthwith & to attend Congress & also to bring with him accounts of Monies recd. & expended by him & to render a Narrative of his proceedings as a Commissioner at the Court of Madrid & Court of France. This amendment I committed to writing at the foot of Mr. Burke's motion & laid it before the President-after some debate whether the motion was in order, it was agreed to amend the Journal of Saturday relative to the order of the Day for tomorrow which the Secretary had entered falsely (3)-the Journal being so amended, it was agreed to postpone the further consideration of the motion till tomorrow.(4)  ""

  Sir Philadelphia May 25th 1779 Congress have resolved to recommend to the States an additional Tax of forty five million dollars, to be paid in by the first of January next. The  MAY 25, 1779  resolve passed the 22d instant. An Address is preparing to accompany it, which, with the Resolve, will be transmitted to the respective Governors as soon as it shall have passed Congress. Is not this a bold Stroke? Now for peremptory Loans.  After various reports respecting the fleet which was seen off Chesapeak it is at length confirmed, that they have enterd the Bay, passed up James River, taken possession of Portsmouth, and Suffolk, burned part of each them, and committed every species of devastation that their savage imaginations could suggest. It is said that they intend to destroy Hampton & Williamsburg, and then proceed up the Bay and destroy Baltimore. The militia of Virginia was collecting, and I hope will check their career.  It is reported, and with circumstances which induce credibility, that Mr. Clark a militia Col of Virginia, who is posted at Illinois, has surprized Govr. Hamilton of Detroit with a party of thirty men, and taken him and them prisoner. The Governor it seems, with this party and a number of Indians, had taken a post of ours, called Vincent, about three of four hundred miles below Fort Pitt, and had in contemplation the retaking of Illinois when he was surprized. The Indians which he had had with him happend luckily to have left him a few days before he was captured.  Congress have passed several resolves declarative of their powers respecting maritime causes; and have directed the President to transmit them to the States. (1) These resolutions were occasioned by the difficulties which have occurred in the case of the Sloop Active, about which much hath been written, & published in the gazettes of this town; and by the disallowance of Appeals, in the Massachusetts-Bay, from the determination in maritime causes.  The Plan of finance will I hope be soon completed, and be acceptable to the several States. The delegates from the State of Rhode Island objected to the Sum recommended to be raised and to the time for collecting and paying it into the Treasury; because they thought the sum too large and the time too short, and for other prudential reasons. Our State I presume would wish to pay off their part of the continental debt as soon as possible, and give every aid in their power to check the career of depretiation; but seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars, in addition to the Sum already voted to be raised, is a large Sum to collect from a State under the circumstances ours is in in so short a period. Perhaps it might suit best to hire part. But of that the wisdom of our Assembly will form the best judgment. I think there was only one State besides ours against the Sum & Time. The great majority on this occasion, and the declarations made by members during the course of debate induce me to believe that great exertions will be used to collect their quotas. The more that is collected by taxation, the less will it be necessary to loan in order to put a stop to further emissions, which is the wish of all. A Stoppage of the press once effected, our liberties are established and an end is put to the war. Our enemy's whole dependence now rests upon our being crushed with the weight of Rheams of depretiated paper money. Once remove that ground  of Hope and they will offer us, as proud and haughty as they may be, honorable terms of peace. I believe we shall give our white and tawny foes to the westward a home stroke this Summer, and perhaps a brilliant stroke may be made in another quarter.

  [May 26, 1779](1) Brothers. The Great Council of the united States of America have receivd and considered the Representation made to them by you (2) the Deputies of the Delaware Nation. (3) Open your Ears and listen to their Answer.  The great Council are not unmindful of the several Treaties of Friendship which they enterd into with your Nation in the years 1775, 1776 & 1777. It was one of their first and great Objects to secure to you and to your Women & Children Peace and Safety: and they extended the same benevolent wishes to All the Nations of Indians on this great Continent- however oppressed by the English who returnd our Love with Fire and Sword. We woud not suffer our Indian Friends to be plunged for our sakes into the Miseries of War. We stood forth like Men and fought our own Battles; and advised them to sit quietly under the Shade of their Trees and reap the Fruits of our Toils & Dangers; the Freedom purchased by our Blood. But the English acted a part very different by Deceit and  MAY 26, 1779  Bribes they blinded the Eyes & understandings of many of our Indian Brethren: & turned their Hearts against Us. They did not stop here: but prevailed on many of them to Join in the War against us: to destroy our Women & Children and plunder our Substance & burn our Villages. For this perfidious Treatment we have never given the Slightest Provocation: our Treaties we have faithfully observed: & tho it was out of our Power to do All that we wished for our Indian Brethren we did them all the good which our Circumstances admitted. We sent over the great Waters for a large Supply of Cloathing & goods, on purpose to Open the Trade & relieve the necessities of our Indian Brethren as we promised them. They must not complain of us for the Disappointment: the English alone are to blame who having more Ships at Sea than the united States robbed us & you of the goods intended for your Support: Let them meet with your Reproaches who are the Cause of your sufferings. The time is at Hand, we trust, when it will be out of their Power to disturb our Trade or to injure our Children or our Friends. Our great & good Ally the King of France has Joined his Warriors by Sea and Land to the Warriors of these united States. Other mighty Nations on the other side of the great Water are our Friends, and will we expect soon take fast hold of the same Covenant Chain which bind us and France. Our great General and our other brave Warriors have already convinced all the World that these united States are not to be conquered; and we have the highest Confidence under the divine Favour that by their Courage and good Conduct as Warriors our enemies will soon be driven from this Country over the great Waters. We have also the best Reasons to expect that with the Aid of our powerful Ally a free Passage thro' the Seas to distant Countries will be opened & preserved, And these united States possessed of the Means of supplying the Wants and establishing a great Trade & relieving the necessities of Such of the Indians as shall continue stedfast in their Friendship.  You tell Us that it is your Opinion that it is for the Interest of the Delaware Nation that they should observe the Strictest Neutraility during the present War. You know best whether this is the general Opinion of your Nation: but we must inform you that it is reported that many of your young Men have Joined the Senecas & taken up the Hatchet aginst Us. Had the Indian Nations remained peaceable: had they not listend to the Voice of our Enemies, & broken their Treaties we are well persuaded they woud have consulted their truest Interest. But while too many of them take an active part, against Us, you cannot be surprized that our Warriors ask for & expect the Assistance of such as profess to be our Friends.  Brothers. We shall take Care of your Children whom you leave with us, & give them a religious & useful Education, & we receive this Mark of your Confidence as a strong Testimony of the Sincerity of your Friendship. Nor shall we neglect when the Country shall be restord to Quiet to encourage & promote your Civilization by inducing Ministers, School Masters, Tradesmen & Husbandmen to reside among you. It is a Measure wise & salutary and in which you will meet with the Applause & assist- MAY 26,1779  ance of good men. When we know in what Measure we can be serviceable to your pious Instructor the Reverend Mr. Ziesberger we will afford him assistance & Encouragement: Well pleased that his Example & Labors have proved acceptable & beneficial to those of your Nation who have embraced Christianity.  Brothers. The Great Council have never interposed with respect to the Claims or Bounds of their Indian Friends. Their disputes ought to be settled by Wise Men of your & our Nations acquainted with your Customs And your Rights which we do not profess to be: Nor have we time while the War continues to Rage to examine into such Matters: Altho' we shall at a future day be glad to give you the best Advice in our power after receiving the Necessary Information.(4)  ""

  Philad. 26t May 1779.  I hope, my dearest Polly, our worthy and amiable Brother and Sister (1) are by this time happily arrived at the Manour. They sat out last  MAY 26,1779  Sunday week and by them I informed you of my Health & of my anxious wishes for your's and the Childrens. The Servant and Mare were returned from an Apprehension that she was unable to perform the Journey. Him I dismissed as his Temper & want of manners disgusted me and his awkardness rendered him of little Service. I have engaged a Lad I like much better, he shaves and dresses very well, and is very obliging hitherto. I wish I may have it in my power to keep him.  I flatter myself you are reconciled for the Reasons I gave you to my staying here a little longer. I want to give my Aid in placing our publick Affairs upon a firm Basis. We have difficulties to encounter: but our prospects are upon the whole agreeable; and with the Blessings of our gracious Creator, and our own Exertions this Campaign, we may reasonable Hope for a Speedy and an honourable Peace. Too much paper money is our great Evil. It woud be for every Man's Interest to give one half of it to the Flames: but this will not be done voluntarily: and indeed nothing will answer The purpose but large Taxes. To these the people ought chearfully to submit: and indeed while money continues so plenty, and Wisdom and Justice are exercised by the Legislatures in the mode of assessment, they will not be too burthensome, altho' the nominal Tax of rich Individuals will make a high Sound.  You need not be uneasy about Summer Cloaths for me: I shall make a good Shift with two or three pair of the Stockings and Changes of linnen or dimathy under cloaths which I have ordered to be made up & bought. I shall fix my Affairs so as to be able to stay at home entirely, or only to serve on some great Occasion; and wish therefore to give entire Satisfaction to my Constituents at this time, when very much is to be done, and diligence and a thorough Knowledge of Business are essential to the publick Safety.  I think of nothing to add, but my dutiful Regards to our honourd Parents: affectionate Compliments to the respective Branches of the Family; and my Blessings to our dear Children.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia May 26th. 1779. Your favor of the 17th I have received. From the late Conduct of the Enemy in Georgia & Virginia I am of Opinion that it never was their intention to make peace before they had risked this Campaign, whatever may have been the appearances to the contrary. Congress never had it in their power absolutely to command a peace consistent with Treaties but I think they had it in their power to have put our affairs abroad in such a situation as probably would have insured it, or at least made prospects more certain than they are at present. War as you justly observe is very uncertain and we must not aim at too much, lest we risk the losing of all. I would not be understood, that I blame Congress, it may have Acted wisely and the event may justify their proceedings. I believe there is not a member in it that would even Sully his reputation by thought, much less by Actions of making any term inconsistent with Treaties. The great risk we run, will be the extension of our ideas & plans beyond them. MAY 26, 1 779  I suppose before this, you have heard from your Brother Jack, & of the cruelties exercised by the Enemy on some Frenchmen that were part of his Crew. I do not think the Enemy will visit Baltimore unless they are reinforced, for they embarked but 2000 men at New York, and surely the DOMINION of Virga will lessen their Number. I wish with all my heart we had immitatd that State more than we did, I mean without Cloathing or Arming our Troops that we sent to the Northd. For now we are in great want of Arms, and cannot get them-We have an Order it is true for all that Congress have in this City, which are only 600, & they want repairing being refuse Arms-Every Thing goes to the Eastward-15000 Continental Blankets are lately arrived at Boston.  I believe the Quarter Masters & Commissaries have had their share in the Depreciation of our Currencies. An enquiry into their Conduct is now on foot,(1) and if I can touch them up over the left Shoulder they may depend that I will do it-perhaps their Tens of thousands, and hundreds of thousands that they have made, may be brought down to limits before we have done with them. But the Speculators are the Vermin that have been the great cause & source of our misfortunes in this respect. I believe so much has been said of Speculators that most of them that were in Congress have withdrawn from that body. Mr. T. Adams from Virga. left it since I came to Phila and I am told does not intend to return again if there are more of these reptils among us God send us a thorough deliverance. Chase denies that he speculated in Flour, and Major Mercer has allowed me to make use of his name as the Author. S Adams declared to me in the presence of Mr Henry that he never said, or heard that Mr. Tilghman or Mr Carroll proposed sending to Genl Howe to know what terms he had to offer and that Chase must have been mad. (2) The Secret of Congress was not of the Magnitude that some gave out, nor yet was it so diminute as Mr Lee would insinuate. Take the mean between the Two Accounts, and you will be near the truth. I think Mr Carmichael received your Letter-I will speak to him. I did not attend to your request till this moment, And the Post perhaps may set out before I close my Letter if I were to keep it open till I see him at Congress today.  We have had a numerous Assembly of the Mobility to regulate Prices, to down with Speculators. They put 6 or 8 of these Gentn to Prison. From the Conduct of this numerous assembly and from the orderly manner in which they conducted themselves, they deserve rather the name of Nobility. I am much against risings of the people, because whenever this happens it infringes upon Civil Government, and it is too apt to end in riot & confusion; But this insurrection must have been set a foot, or at least countenanced by the Civil Authority, who refused protection to Monopolizers that applyed for it-a Committee was appointed to say what prices all Articles shall be sold at, and are to reduce them Monthly till they bring them down to what they were in January, they are now reduced to what they were in April. If you see Mr Brown Tell him, that I shall write to him by next Post. I shall depend upon him as a sure Card for informa- May 26, 1779  Photographic Reproduction of Philadelphia Committee Broadside, May 25-26, 1779  tion about the inequitous practices of the Depy. D.

  Sir Marine Committee, Philadelphia May 26th 1779  Your Excellencys Letter of the 25th instant to this Committee together with an extract from another of the 17th instant to the President of Congress has been duely considered by the Committee. (1) Unfortunately the situation of our Frigates is such, as to afford no reason to expect that they can possibly be collected in Season to execute the plan proposed. The Providence of 32 Guns & the Ranger of 18 are already ordered on A Cruize and it is supposed must be at Sea before different Orders can reach them at Boston. The Warren of 36 Guns & the Queen of France of 20 Guns have lately returned from A Cruize and are unmanned. Although the Naval force of the enemy at New York is at present trifling, yet as their Situation in this respect is very fluctuating, they may probably be so reinforced as to render it too hazardous to risk only the two Frigates in this River viz the Confederacy of 36 Guns & the Deane of 28 Guns, the later of which wants a great number of Hands to make up her Complement. Add to this that though the force of the enemy on the water would be inferior to ours, yet might they not retire under cover of the Batteries on Shore, and receive effectual protection from any Annoyance that could be attempted from the Guns of our Small Ships?  I am desired by the Committee to Assure you Sir, that they shall always be ready with the greatest Alacrity to employ our little fleet in the execution of such Plans as may be suggested to them by your Excellency whenever circumstances shall be such as to render it practicable.

  Gentlemen Philaa. 27th May 1779 The Committee have carefully exd. your Calculation but cannot agree with you as to the Magnitude of the Amount. They wish to have Materials on which to form if possible a solid Judgment such as the Issues to the Army and Posts. Also the Issues from the Purchasing to the issuing Department.  In the Interim it may be prudent to suppose that the Error may as well lie on the one Side as on the other and therefore to allow Time for a Correction of it. With this View it may be proper to purchase South of the Delaware over and above the Consumption at the several Posts within MAY 27, 1779  that Tract of Country 10,000 Blls. by the 1st Day of August. To accomplish this let that Quantity be divided among ten, fifteen or twenty Purchasers as shall be most convenient assigning to each one his Quantity, of this let 1/4 be ready at some particular spot in his District by the 20th of June 1/4 more by the 10th of July and the Remainder by the 1st of August. Perhaps it might be of Use to give so much per Barril for the Purchase restricting it to contain 224 lbs at least instead of a Commission on the Money and to limit the Price giving a further Gratuity of so much in the Pound for whatever it is obtained lower, in which Case the Salt should be valued at a fixed Sum and rather too high than too low as thereby the Flour would eventually come cheaper to the Treasury. On these Regulations we should be glad of your Sentiments.  We must insist upon a Return of the several Officers in the Department. Their weekly Purchases and the Gratuities as well of Rations as of Money or otherwise allowed them by the Public.

  My dear sir, Chester 8 o'clock, Thursday Evg. [May 27, 1779] On my way here I met with Mr. Serjeant, (1) of whom I enquired touching the proof he had mentioned of Deanes having communicated the intended Treaty to Wharton (2) in London some days before its conclusion. The Witness is, it seems, Surgeon to Proctors Regiment, now on its way to Pittsburg. This Man was the Bearer of the letters to Wharton, and his evidence is I think very conclusive. I assure you Sir I am in this case not influenced in the least by motives of personal resentment, the thorough conviction I have of the public good that will result from fixing on Mr. Deane the guilt that I am satisfied he has practised, influences me solely. It is impossible that justice can be done, either to the community, or to Individuals, unless this man be properly understood. And certainly nothing more is necessary to accomplish this than to proceed with serious determination to the enquiry and collect the evidence written and oral that this country abundantly furnishes. The establishment of his criminality will at once prevent him from imposing on the public to its future injury, and do justice to the characters he has traduced by charging them with crimes committed by himself. This evidence may easily be had from Pittsburg.(3) Sr. James Jay & Capt. Nicholson are in Philadelphia. Mr. MAY 27, 1 779  Diggs will attend when called on. These, with the papers you have, shew enormity sufficient to place Mr. Deane in the light he ought to be seen in. I should not have troubled you Sir with so long a letter on so foul a subject, if I were not perfectly satisfied of your attachment to the cause of justice and general good, your dislike of public defaulters and your desire to protect and defend the virtuous Servants of the United States. I understand by Mr. Sergeant that Mr. Secretary Thomson has been long acquainted with Dr. Kendals evidence,(4) and having concealed it, and acted the part he has done renders him as unfit to be the Secretary of Congress as any other W-h-e (5) in Philadelphia. I shall continue to entertain the very agreeable hopes of being honored with your company in your way Southward. Your route is thro Baltimore, cross Potomac at Hoes, and from Mr. Hoe you will get exact directions to my house.  I am, with most affectionate esteem dear Sir your most obedient and obliged servant, Richard Henry Lee  P.S. My friend Colo.

The slaughter of your horse & the record on your arm, testify that your journey to So Carolina was not calculated merely for pleasureable amusements. When did it happen? Where?

I have not troubled him with a syllable respecting my private affairs from an assurance that even a syllable would have been unnecessary, but I must remind you of my Papers, all my Papers,(2) Plate, wearing apparel & last of all Liquer.

  Dear Governor, Phila. [May 30, 1779] Yesterday the House were resolv[ed into] a Committee of the whole upon our Vermont Business and as far as [Decla]rations can be trusted and Appearances I hope we shall be able to render our State a good Account of that Business. Nothing was concluded but on Tuesday next we are again to take it up in a Committee of the whole & I hope it will during the Course of the Week be concluded to our Satisfaction. Mr. Jay and Mr. Duane who had the principal Share in the Debate did full Justice to the Cause and stated the Merits with a Clearness and Force irresistible unless by Prejudice and Blindness. (1) MAY 30, 1 779  I did flatter myself with the Pleasure of seeing you the Begining of the next Month. The Care of my Health which has much suffered by a long and unremitted Attention was a principal Motive of my Design. Mr. Lewis who is with you and Mr Duer whenever he shall be with you will be able to give a full & accurate account of the Situation of our Public Affairs here. For this Reason and as I have lately been blessed with an Interval of better Health than usual I shall defer for some Time my Return. This Indeed I am compelled to do for the Business [of the imp]ortant Committees which Congress have done me [. . .] upon hath so principally devolved to my Manage[ment. . .] that I cannot quit it without Injury to the Public. [The Me]asures I have lately taken will I hope be productive of very [good?] Consequences to our State. To what Extent & Effect they may [. . .] It is not in human Prudence to determine because Human [Pru]dence cannot govern Events. I am not now at Liberty to state these Things but a little Time will I hope display them.  The Torrent of Abuse which hath been poured out agt me hath doubtless reached my Constituents. (2) Those who know me will do me the Justice to think properly on the Occasion. Could I believe myself capable of any among the many Things which have been said I should heartily despise myself. One Consolation I derive from it and that is a great one. Those who vilify and traduce me are my Enemies because they are Enemies to the State I represent. They are my Enemies because I will not prostitute myself to the Purposes of Faction. Such Enmity I shall court rather than avoid. Nor can it ever give me one momentary Pang unless it should affect the Minds of my Constituents or my Friends.

  Dear Livingston Phila. 30th May 1779 It is now I beleive near three Months since I have written to you a Syllable or indeed to any Friend I have on Earth. (1) The General omission hath been owing to a Motive I hardly dare to name. It is however a Truth that I have not been a Moment that I was at once at Leizure in Health and alone. I should however have made Opportunities to write to you but I have been led to expect You here every Moment for the whole Time of my Silence, Why you have not come I know not Neither will I enquire because I hope you will personally give an Account of yourself at this  MAY 30, 1 779  Place in some very short Period.(2) This City is now the Scene of Politicks high and low I may add it is the Scene of Faction, Anarchy & Detraction. Never were the Affairs of any Country in a better and a worse Situation than those of America at this Moment. A Storm is gathering and will burst upon the Heads of our Enemies perhaps of our own. Would to God that the Desire of that great Luxury to be free was the Great Desire of my Countrymen. But other Luxuries more alluring have influence but too much upon this Conduct. The Torrent of Paper Money hath swept away with it much of our Morals and impaired the national Industry to a Degree truly alarming. Having successfully opposed the first energetic Efforts of the Enemy the struggle seems to have exhausted us and after foiling the Giant we shrink at the Touch of a Child. I fear before this reaches you Charlestown will no longer own the Authority of Congress. There indeed the Enemy will probably stop there they will collect their Forces and endeavor to weary us into a Submission by Harrassing our Coasts and Frontiers and striking at our Money. From Halifax, Rhode Island, New York, Portsmouth in Virginia & Charlestown their Cruizers will infest or rather destroy our Commerce and the little Armies necessary to watch their Motions and prevent their Ravages will effectually exhaust our little remaining Resources. This is one Side of the Picture. On the other like the Bottom of Pandora's Box is Hope. Spain perhaps while I write this is in Arms and while France keeps Great Britain at Bay Gibraltar and Jamaica will call for Protection which they may not perhaps obtain. If the Squadron at St. Lucia is incapable of offensive Operations & kept in Check by D'Estaing five Ships of the Line would cleanse the Continent of her Foes, Or even if this should not be the Case a naval Victory in Favor of France either in Europe or America would turn the Ballance so powerfully in our Favor as to cover our Enemies with Confusion. At any Rate a Continuance of the War must thoroughly exhaust them as well as us and the Business terminate as such Business usually does in the laying down of Arms from mutual Weariness. In this Case the most obstinate Councils would be the most efficacious. But whither am I going? Pray present all my Affections to your Family and give for me a gratulatory Kiss to the Brides of it. I think you have two.  I wish much to see you. Mrs. Livingston's Shoes will be well dried. By the bye I got two Pair instead of one. At 26 Dlls. per Pair & had I received your Note a Fortnight sooner should have paid only 16. If they were bought now the Price would be 40. O Tempora O Mores.

You will also receive herewith enclosed a Copy of another Act of Congress of this day, on the same Subject from which You will perceive it to be the design of Congress to send a committee to the Inhabitants on the Grants, to enquire into the Reasons why they refuse to continue Citizens of the Respective States which heretofore exercised Jurisdiction over that district and to take every prudent measure to promote an amicable Settlement of all differences, and prevent divisions and Animosities so prejudicial to the United States.(2) There is reason to believe that the measures adopted by this Act of Congress will prove salutary, especially as it was passed with uncommon Unanimity.

7309,dg0133,1779,Daniel of St Thomas Jenifer to Thomas Johnson,"""  Daniel of St. Thomas Jenifer to Thomas Johnson Dear Sir, Phila. June 1st. 1779 The intelligence that Congress has received from Virga. is very imperfect.(1) Governor Henrys Letters are short and convey nothing more than that the Enemy were in Possession of Portsmouth and distroyed our Stores &c. at Suffolk & burnt that place. I suppose his time is much taken up with Militia Officers. I know something of this business, and a sufficient plague they are to any man who has to direct the operations of the body they command, & who may do for the Spur of an occasion, but cannot be kept long together. I should be made very happy that the flour you mention was taken off for the use it was purchased. The Gentleman you've named would do exceedingly well for the Purchasing such Articles as you mention for the Army-and ought to be furnished with Money in time; but as plenty as it is abroad, it is scarce enough in the Treasury. Ten Millions of Dollars were lately issued & Ten Millions more must be within a few days. Whilst Congress are disputing upon Modes of Finance our Money is sinking to nothing, tho' I must observe to you, that Gold has fell within a few days from 25 to 18. for one, & other Goods, and Provisions have fallen something. But they will rise again & perhaps be higher than ever, unless some methods are expeditiously adopted that may give our Circulating Medium a better Credit than it is in at present. The loss of Pondicherry,(2) & the interruption given to the Trade of France will I fear prevent our procuring a loan from that Quarter for more Money, than will purchase Arms, Amunition & cloathing for our Troops, and Spain in appearance is too slow in her Motions to afford us immediate relief. What will be the contingent issue God only knows? Perhaps the Emperor & his Catholic Majesty may mediate a peace, if they do, I wish it may be a good one for America. But what is doing for us in Europe we know not, having had no intelligence from that Quarter for five Months past. Some method must be taken to satisfy our Army, it is impossible for us to keep it together much longer, unless the Depreciation of the Money is made up to the Officers. Connecticut has promissed their Troops that it shall be done, but partial promisses hurt the Cause more than they help it. Both Armies begin to move a little, but I think the Enemy will not quit York Island till their Army is reinforced. And we are not strong enough to attack, nor indeed to do more than to act defencively, & scarcely that, were the Enemy to spread their Troops by detachments to different quarters. Yesterday a Vessel arrived here from New Providence, she cleared for New York. Baldwin Loaded her with Fruits-the Capt. informs that accounts had reached that place before he left it, that the Enemy  JUNE 1, 1779  had met with a total defeat near Charles Town, it is barely possible that this News could be true & time for information to have been recd in Providence. We have not recd any intelligence from S. Carolina since the 5th Inst. I feel exceedingly for our distressed brethren in that State. God send them a good deliverance. Present me to Mrs. Johnson & believe me to be unalterably, Your Excellencys affectionate friend & sevt. Daniel of St Thos Jenifer [P.S.] Govr. Henry has resigned & Mr Page it is said Elected Govr.

You was most certainly right as to Haldimand, (1) a Detachment from him was on its Way when you wrote. But I hope your Lincoln (2) has been in such Luck as will more than make up for wrong Plans in other Parts or Blunders in Execution which I am led to expect from the Bizarrerie of the Fortune of your Predicessor in Command at Providence Plantations.(3) If the Enemy are actually & generally defeated at Carolina, as is highly probable, I think the War will close very fast. Three days will give us a true State of the matter.(4) I hope we shall be able to tell the Continent we will not strike another Bill after a few Weeks. Monied Men ought to subscribe to lend us on such assurance being given to them. The Quarter Master & Commissary Genl. call upon us so as to make it imprudent to declare we will stop the Press till we have some Prospect of other certain Supply.

Brown heard me last Evening lay all the Circumstances together. In short, I do credit it. And three days will decide. JUNE 1, 1779  I am now out of the Way of my public duty.

Hampshire and New York as it was practiced before this Contest with Britain-and promise that we will procure a Redress of Grievances. The first proposal involves a great Question hinted at by Maryland. If the Felicity of the People is the Ground of uniting under Governmen[t], if certain and easy Execution of Law makes part of that Felicity, surely a Proposal to Seperate in extensive Jurisdictions is very natural. Provinces allow it to Towns upon hearing the Parties, Towns to parishes &c &c. Neither the Provinces or Towns becoming Losers but rather Gainers by the Bargain. The Continent cannot lose by running lines of Survey between State & State but will certainly gain by all the Comforts and Conveniences will the Parts from Time to Time acquire tending to encourage Population and Culture.

The Moderation observable in those Resolutions we hope will meet with your approbation. The more gentle just & persuasive the Proceedings of Congress in this Business are the more likely they will be to succeed and if treated with neglect by the People of the Grants, the greater Degree of Indignation will such neglect create through all the States. These Resolutions coincide exactly with the Ideas of the Eastern Delegates. The Committee will be chosen to-morrow.(3) We shall for many obvious Reasons vote for a majority of eastern men. The Proclamations doing Justice to the Revolters have had a happy effect here. In our opinion JUNE 1, 1779  it will be wise to abstain from Hostilities for the present and rather suffer a little than shed blood. If the Members of Congress are really as much in earnest as they appear to be all will be well. We are very much disposed to credit their Declarations on the subject & have ground to hope that this and every other Cause of Jealousy may be done away and Mutual Confidence, Harmony & good Understanding take place between New York & her sister States to the eastward.

Your Excellency is no stranger to the part I have acted for General Schuyler; considering his abilities and high military Rank to be of the most essential Importance to our State; after defeating all the attempts for his destruction, and seeing him honorably acquitted, he has disappointed all my Labours by persevering in, or rather reiterating, his Resignation in Terms the most absolute. It is true he has many Provocations; but by this step he has equally hurt the feelings of his Friends, & gratified his Enemies. I shall long impatiently to hear how the new Tax of 45 millions is relished in our state. It is a great Effort but nothing less coud prevent the total Loss of our publick credit? Does the address tend to produce a Confidence that the money will be ultimately secure? I take that to be the cardinal point. I thank your Excellency for your particular attention to me, & I hope the same favourable sentiments of my attention to duty will pervade the Legislature. I am confident if application, assiduous application, entitle me to Indulgence it will not be withheld. There are a few things I wish to see accomplished, & then to be permitted to visit my Family & look after the shatterd Ruins of my Fortune. The power of fixing the Rotine of the Delegates ought doubtless to be vested in your Excellency. Without this it will never be equal, or indeed tolerable to any Man who is not wholly divested of domestic Feelings. I recollect that for the period of 28 months, I was in the whole only four with my Family. Is not this beyond any Rate of proportion? Your Excellency will receive the acts of Congress respecting the Revolt from our State by this Conveyance. On this subject I refer you to our publick Letter.(2) It is my opinion that if the proposed Committee act with propriety, they may influence a great Majority to return to their Duty; But I am equally perswaded that if they please they can fix them forever in their opposition. This is not a desirable Hazard, altho' it is preferable to the Effusion of American Blood. In short, Sir, much depends on the Candour of the New England Delegates, some of whom have fomented this seperation. Now the Property is secure to their Friends, they may be contented. They are loud in their professions, and I am disposed to meet them with some degree of Confidence; Indeed to bury all animosities in everlasting oblivion.

And as this Committee have received authentic intelligence that a number of the enemys Privateers are Cruizing near the Latitude of 36, in expectation of falling in with a fleet of Merchant Vessels bound from the West Indies to the Ports of Philada. and Chesapeake Bay, it is their first object to frustrate the designs of the enemy by Capturing or destroying their Vessels and to afford every aid & Assistance in their power to the inward bound Merchantmen, particularly the Brig Baltimore Capt. Read which is ladened with Continental stores & daily expected. They have also received information that the enemy at New York have sent out the Delaware of 24 Guns and the Galathea of 20 Guns to cruize upon this Coast. Your Attention will  JUNE 2, 1779  therefore be necessarily turned towards these two Ships, and we need not remind you how greatly it would redound to your reputation and the honor of the American flag to Capture or destroy these ships. You are to continue Cruizing for the space of three weeks from your Departure from the Capes of Delaware, after which time you are to return to the Capes and call at Mr. Henry Fisher at Lewis Town near Cape Henlopen with whom will be lodged the further orders of this Committee. As the Object of this Cruize is to take or destroy the enemys Privateers or small ships of war, and give every aid & assistance to the Merchantmen, the Committee direct you to confine yourself strictly to the Latitudes above mentioned and to such Longitudes as are best calculated to answer that purpose. But if from circumstances it should happen that the Public service necessarily requires you to exceed those Limits then you are at liberty to do it. The Ship General Greene Captain Montgomery belonging to the State of Pennsylvania now in the Bay will have orders from His Excellency President Reed to act in conjunction with you during this Cruize. Captain Harding will be furnished with a Copy of these Instructions and will be directed to obey your Orders as senior Officer.(1) It is expected that before you put to Sea you will fix with him a proper System of Signals for the Ships under your command. The Confidence we repose in your Courage and good Conduct gives us every reason to hope for a successful Cruize-Both the ships of war and Privateers from New York are inferior to the force under your direction which will put in your power to aid the trade of the States and thereby not only render essential service to the Public but add greatly to your Own reputation and the honor of the American flag.

7325,dg01319,1779,Henry Laurens Notes of Debates,"""Henry Laurens' Notes of Debates   [June 3? 1779] When Dr. Morgan's Memorial & the Report were given in at the Table, 13 March 1779 Mr. D(1) pressed for a day for considering it-said, \""perhaps I may not be here, therefore I wish for a short day\""-Postponed. Three or four days after, Dr. Morgan called on me & pressed my aid to bring on the consideration. I assured him of my good will  JUNE 3, 1779  towards him (which I did with great sincerity) & added I was sorry he had been so very severe upon particular characters, it did not in the least degree help his cause-that a plain state of what appeared to him to be facts, would have left Congress unbiased judges, whereas such language as he had adopted would at least seem to have been calculated for prejudicing the minds of the Members of Congress. Dr. Morgan replied he had struck out those parts which he supposed I alluded to-I was amazed but gave no answer. About two Weeks after I saw Mr. Drayton at the Table in Congress take the Report of the Committee of which Dr. Morgan's memorial is a part, & having a paper in his left hand as a director for his proceeding, obliterate several parts of the Memorial-which I remarked to two Members then in Congress. The 3d June '79 Mr. Searle moved in very affecting terms for assuming the consideration of the forementioned Report. Mr. Drayton warmly seconded him.(2) Mr. Laurens rose and said he knew of no Report respecting Dr. Morgan before the House, that there had been one, but, that, that, had undergone such alterations & obliterations since it had been delivered to the House, as in his opinion, destroyed its original character \""the Report of the Committee.\"" The President expressed surprize & ask'd, \""Since it was delivered in, to the House?\"" Mr. Laurens replied, \""Yes Sir, since & some parts long since\"". Mr. M. Smith & Mr. Penn said Doctor Morgan with permission of the Committee had struck out some parts of his memorial which had been thought to contain too severe reflections against particular persons. Mr. Laurens rose and said he knew of no Report respecting Dr. Morgan before the House, that there had been one, but that, that, had obliterated several parts. Mr. Drayton arose & said he had-\""that there were some severe epithets which had been struck out (or expunged) in order to make it go down the better\"". These were his very (foolish) words. The President said to him- \""after the Paper was delivered to the house you had no right to strike out or alter a single Iota. I am clear in this.\"" Mr. Drayton was proceeding to justify his practice or to extenuate the fault, when Mr. Laurens said, that (meaning the practice) should be considered at a proper time & he hoped in a proper manner, & called for the Order of the day, Vizt. the Report on Mr. Girard's communication which was accordingly brought forward. The same Morning Vizt. 3d June-Mr. Drayton came to me in the House & said \""Huger & Hutson are come to Town & intend to go to Charles Town in a day or two have we any thing to write by them officially?\"" I answered, \""if you recollect any thing, it will be proper, I thought to have transmitted General Washington's orders to General Scott as we had agreed to do in an official Letter but as I found  you had privately taken a Copy of it & as you have said nothing to me since I suppose you have sent that Copy, haven't you?\"" Mr. Drayton in some confusion said, Yes I have, but they (referring to the Gentlemen above named) won't go in less than a day or two & perhaps in that time we may recollect something. I answered, 'tis very well but I suppose the Gentlemen will have the good manners to let me know of their intention of going. Mr. Drayton, said no doubt! no doubt! and retired. N.B. the case of Gen. Washington's Orders to Gen. Scott above referred to is thus. The 28th May, when those were read in Congress I moved the House that a Copy of them might be delivered by the Secretary to the Delegates of So. Carolina which was immediately granted.(3) Mr. Drayton came immediately & asked me for what purpose I had moved for the Copy. I answered for the Delegates, you observed what I said; I think we ought to send a Copy in an Official Letter to the Governor (Meaning Governor Rutledge) it will afford some satisfaction to our State to see the attention which the General has paid to them & it will not be amiss to acquaint them with the particular orders & indeed I think it is proper for us to write a complimentary Letter to General Washington upon the occasion. Mr. Drayton highly approved of both propositions-when Congress was about adjourning between three & four oClock I applied to the Secretary for the Copy, he told me Mr. Drayton had taken one himself. I desired him nevertheless to furnish me with a Certified Copy according to the Order of the House. On Sunday Morning (4) Stuart an Express called to inform me he was going to So Carolina, otherwise I should have been ignorant of that opportunity as I had been of many preceeding public conveyances-& as I was morally certain Mr. Drayton knew of it, & as he had not called on or spoke to me concerning the Official Letters which we had agreed to write (& he chooses always to be the writer of our public Letters) I immediately suspected he intended to transmit privately the Copy of the above mentioned Orders, & so it has proved. His information therefore of Messrs. Huger & Hutson's intention of going to Carolina & application to know if we should write an Official Letter seems to have been calculated for decoying me into an act which should have the appearance of neglect of duty-being rendered unnecessary by his vigilance in the previous private transmission. The Copy sent to me by the Secretary was not delivered to me till Evening & was not Certified. ""

Lincoln had defeated the enemy in South Carolina. We are in anxious hourly expectation to receive some authentic advice from that quarter. Our last advices are as old as the 5th of May, and have been printed. The Assistant Quartermaster General, Mr. Pettit, received a letter this morning from a Deputy Quartermaster General, at the head of Elk river dated June 3d, informing him that the day before, two of the enemy's ships were seen off Pawtuxet river, sounding the Bay, and that they JUNE 4, 1779  were attended with a number of smaller vessels, and that he had removed the principal part of the stores from the head of Elk, &c. Congress has ordered a loan of twenty millions Continental dollars, but has not yet agreed upon the terms of borrowing.(2) As it may be very difficult to collect our quota of the Continental tax in season, would it not be advisable to hire a part of it at a moderate interest, to be paid when the tax should be collected. It is thought that those who hold considerable sums, would be willing to lend on this occasion. Every effort will be made by Congress to put our finances on such a footing as to stop any further emission of money; and it is hoped that every friend to his country will lend his aid to give efficiency to this measure.

It was rash in me to censure you for what Sovereigns do in all Parts of the World. Charging me with being a Flatterer you only exercised the Power of misinterpreting some of my most sincere Sentiments: And I, forsooth, ran into the antiquated Notion of a Distinction between Right & Power. I smile, however, with myself in a Sort of revengeful Humour, while I consider how You also, like some others born to hold Dominion have been hurried into an Exertion which only tends to discover the Impotence of Might when operating against Integrity. Have you by the Artillery of Misnomer made me resign my affectionate Regard? Have you even deterred me from using Terms suited to my Opinions? No, for I will this Instant stile you \""Very amiable Portia.\"" And having done that Act of Justice to my own Feelings, and furnished You with a Hint for a moralizing Meditation upon the nature of Empire, I proceed to the Business for which I catched up my Pen at first haunted with the Thought that the booted Bearer would return to me in five Minutes after leaving my Window. The Box, which Mr. Adams left 20 months ago to the Care of Mr. Sprout's Family, on the Morning of Sepr. l9th., the Era of our Flight to York Town, came Yesterday to my Hand. I found it almost empty, but I imagine just as he parted with it tho contrary to my Expectation. Perhaps he left you with some Memorandum.(1) I had determined to keep the Box here, and send the Things by Parts, at easy Opportunities, even if they had been more in Number. JUNE 5, 1779  I have sealed up all the Papers into neat Packets, and forward a Part by the Bearer of this who goes with a Guard. Mr. S. Adams will be on his Way home next Week and a Waggon in Company. You will find the Papers regularly put together which for the most part was easy to be performed, as they were, for the most part, endorsed. The others I so far looked into as would enable me to finish the Arrangement. I might innocently have gone further, with two Packages, I mean those endorsed P.(2) which accompany my Letter. But it happened that I had no Curiosity to satisfy there; and with the others, tho Curiosity at times prompted me, I could not without Guilt indulge it. Am I right in my Notions of Letter-Peeping? In those Cases where Improprieties of Stile or Sentiment or Secrets intended only for the Eyes of the Correspondent are supposed to be penned, it is cri[minal] to venture. But where there is undoubted Right to expect only the Product of a Pen directed by the Fingers of a virtuous, elegant, discrete Writer, I hold it lawful, comparatively, to peep; if a man is quite at Leisure, and in danger moreover of running into notorious mischief unless he so employs himself, Curiosity also having at the same Time its stimulating Goads at work upon him. These six last Lines narrow my System plaguily; I am sure they were not in my Imagination when I was putting together the Letters of Portia, who had more than thrice kindly shown me how she could write, and another Friend shows me weekly what a virtuous Wife will naturally write to her absent Husband. Thus was I without Curiosity in Regard to the two Packages which grounded my Descant upon Letter-Peeping. If I do not get Opportunity to write somewhat at large to you on the Politics of Europe and the Great House in Chesnut-Street Philadelphia,(3) yet you will not have Reason to regret my Occupations; as Mr. S.A. will in a more pleasing Manner communicate to you more than would be proper for the Pen. I shall convey under Seal and other Security Mr. Adams's Letter Book and Accounts. If he did not settle with the State before he went you had better see how Mr. Dana gave in his Demand, and not descend to Minutenesses such as I remember to have heard my absent Friend say it was unbecoming to be subjected to, and such as you will find by Mr. Avery have not been practiced. Though I am prepared for such a Thing I will not chuse to submit to it.

(1) The Timber provided for the 74 Gun Ship building in your harbour we would have you put in such a State as to prevent it from rotting until a better time presents for pursuing the work. This we think may be done without incurring any great Expence by having it properly piled and covered with Scantling. We observe what you say respecting the Packets lately built and are pleased to find the Mercury so good a sailor, we desire you will hold Two of them in such a State as to be ready to sail in four or five days after the dispatches of Congress may reach your hands at the same time we think it will not be necessary to keep them fully manned. At present we have no idea of building any more vessels shortly, but when in future it shall be determined to build any in your Department we will not be unmindful of your recommendation of Mr Peck. As it is found that the Brigantine General Gates is so unsuitable a vessel for a Cruizer, we desire you will sell her to the best advantage reserving if you think proper her Guns and such of her materials as will be for the Public benefit. We have already wrote you that Captain Saltonstal should command the Warren in the room of Captain Hopkins, and as this Committee will never countenance any indecency of behaviour in their Officers to their Superiors-if Captain Palms has transgressed in any manner that will subject him to a Court Martial it is our desire that you immediately Order One to be held upon him; and we make no doubt as you have hitherto supported your dignity, so you will always continue to do it. We take it for granted that you will not suffer that lucky vessel the Sloop Providence to remain in Port, and we recommend to you the practice of always sending out the small vessels in company with the large ones. We enclose herein two receipts for four hundred Dollars advanced by our Agent at Baltimore William Smith Esqr. to Captain John Perkins of the Schooner Hazard for Paying Disbursements-that Vessel sailed the 2d. or 3d ultimo from Baltimore with 178 Barrels flour, 6 Tons, 18 Ct, 2 Qr bar Iron on board addressed to Mr John Langdon at Portsmouth for the use of your Department, and from intelligence since received we have reason to think she has been taken, and we find in the New York Paper that the General Arnold which sailed from Senepuxent with flour & Iron has been carried in there. The Confederacy & Boston have already Sailed to Cruize upon this Coast in quest of those Privateers that have so much infested our  JUNE 8, 1779  Trade, and we expect in a few days that the Deane will be able to follow them.

7347,dg01341,1779,Daniel of St Thomas Jenifer to Thomas Johnson,"""  Daniel of St. Thomas Jenifer to Thomas Johnson Dear Sir, Phila. June 8th 1779. I am obliged by your Excellencys favor of the 4th. The Fleet from Virga. arrived at New York the 29th Ulto. and Rivington says with the loss of but one man, & Without disembarking their Men proceeded up North River to join Genl Clinton then in full March for Fort Arnold about 60 miles above Kingsbridge. (1) We have lost a small Fort & 70 Men, and I fear that the other is not impregnable; but our people seem to have great confidence in its holding out, and Baffling all attempts that the Enemy may make, Should we be so unfortunate as to lose this Fortress, the Communication between the Northern & Southern States will in a great measure be cut off. And as we are filling this place with Troops such a disaster would greatly weaken us in the Field, at a time when we have not, either, men to spare, or Ammunition to part with. General Washington is in full March for North river, but I fear the Detachmt. to the Westward under Genl. Sullivane has so much weakened our main Army that we cannot risk a General Engagement, altho the Salvation of the Fort may demand  JUNE 8, 1779  it. I am glad, & rejoice with my Countrymen, that the immagined Men of War are turned into Merchantmen, And that the Piratical Villains that had taken one of them, met with the Justice due to their Crime. We have not received any Dispatches, or private intelligence from S. Carolina since the 5th of June (2) that can be depended upon, the Enemy at that time were 68 Miles from C. Town. I think that some Capital stroke has been struck to our advantage; were it otherwise, we should have heard of it through New York by the Channel of the Tories before this time. The Virginians and some of the Northern States, (particularly N. York) are inflexible at present as to the Back Lands. The narrow principle of present Emolument supersedes the consideration of future distresses that it may occasion. A little time will convince these men of their error. The Vermont people have erected a Governmt. & chose a Governor, and every other Officer of Government, and are now under the full exercise of it. The State of New York has applied to Congress for Aid. A Committee is appointed to repair to these people, hear what they have to say, & report to Congress. The N.E. States seem to countenance that of Vermont notwithstanding the Claims of Massachusets & New Hampshire to considerable parts of the Territory on which those people of Vermont are setled. Their Aim no doubt is to gain another Voice in Congress, if they succeed, I suppose another State must be erected out of Virga. as a Counterbalance-what will this tend to prove? Why, what you justly observe, that Congress ought to take upon them this business, & retain in that body the power over the unlimitted Countries to the Westward. Whilst we retain our Negative to the present plan of confederation the Door will be open for Justice to be done us, the moment it is turned into an Affirmative, it will not only be shut, but locked against us.(3) You have dropt several useful & wise hints, which deserve the most serous consideration, & I hope will influence; I can trully say, that so far as it may be in my power, they shall be extended to take in those objects for which they were designed. We cannot I think obtain a Sufficient Loan for the carrying on the War till Spain becomes a party in it. Our difficulties no doubt will be great under our present and accumulating load of Debt; but we must struggling [struggle] through them in the best manner we can. We must not appreciate our Money too fast-if we do, those men who have Nobly struggled to Defend their property, must become the Tenants & Vassals of those who have done every thing in their power to ruin the States. Turn your thoughts upon this serious Subject, & commit them to paper by the time the Genl. Assembly meets, when I intend down. You will be pleased to let me know before hand when this will be. I am Dear Sir, Your Excely. Affectionate friend & Servt, Daniel of St. Thos. Jenifer  [P.S.] Present my Compliments to the Council. ""

I have the pleasure to inform You, that the News of our Success in South Carolina, is so far confirmed,(1) tho We have not yet received any Express, as to put the Truth of it beyond all Doubt. The Enemy attack'd our Lines at Charlestown, and were bravely repulsed. They attacked a second time, & while the Action was well maintain'd on both sides, a Column of Lincoln's Army appear'd in the Rear of the Enemy, & immediately falling upon them, put them to a total Rout, with a very great loss of kill'd & taken on the spot-and then pursued them as they were scattered in small parties to make their Escape, which perhaps is the Reason, that we have not yet had any Express from him. It is said, the Enemy's Numbers were 4000 British, & 3000 Tories, the latter of which made little or no Resistance. In short, tho the particulars cannot be authentically ascertained, Congress is convinc'd that the Affair is another Bourgoiynade-and every successive Blow of that kind, must be more severely felt than the preceding, because it is striking upon a Place already sore & weakened. Let Us all at this important Crisis intensely recollect our Duties to Heaven & our Country-cooperate in our several Stations with the Efforts of our gallant Brethren in the field, and after vanquishing Lions in fair fight, not suffer ourselves to be ruined in our internal & domestic Affairs by the most contemptible Vermin that ever crept upon the Earth. I saw a Letter Yesterday from the Quarter Master General. He mentions the Enemy's having gone up in Force to West point on North River,(2) an important Post of ours well situated, fortified, and garrisoned. After viewing it some time, part of them return'd down the River, & from Circumstances it is believ'd, an Irruption into New Jersey is intended. My Brother came to town last night, from General Cadwalader's, & tells Me he came up in Consequence of an Express, to collect the Jersey Militia with all possible Expedition. It is supposed, but without any Evidence that can be depended on, that Genl. Clinton may take the Field with 8 or 10000 Men. Such a Force will not be able to accomplish any great Matter. JUNE 10, 1779  If We baffle the Attempts of our Invaders this Campaign, & convince them, that our Finances are not in an utterly irrecoverable Disorder, I hope this Year will crown our Labours with peace, Liberty, & Safety.

7359,dg01353,1779,John Dickinson s Notes,"""John Dickinson's Notes   June 11th, 1779 On a conversation with Coll. Mitchell,(1) he informs Me, that from some Time in Novr. last to 16 March he paid a suff[icien]t Number for Duty of Vol[untee]r Waggons 40s. per Day for a Waggon, 4 Horses & Driver with Forage provisions, the owners shoeing their own Horses. The owners eng[agin]g as they pleas'd for 1, 2, 3 or JUNE 11, 1779  more Months-the pay then allow'd by Law being 55s per Day. That notwithstanding such Barg he raised the prices to the Contractors, as he gave higher prices to others. That from the 16 March to about 20 April Art[icles] being adv[ance]d in price, he p[ai]d Vol[untee]r Waggons the full price of 55s allow'd by Law. That about that Time the prices still advancing, & the Law hav[in]g rais'd the pay to £4.10 per Day, he agreed to give £3.10 per Day which contd. to the 1st Day of May. When Art[icles] still cont[inuin]g to advance, he rais'd the pay to the £4.10 per Day-at which it still continuing. He is persuaded that the states exempt[in]g Drivers of Vol[untee]r Waggons from Militia Duty & Fines on that Acco[un]t while in the service would exceedingly promote that service as Men would more readily engage in it & as he thinks at lower prices-& those Men would be of a better kind & more careful-that the Mode of employing Vol[untee]r Waggons greatly preferable to that of pressing, that the add[itiona]l pay of 10s per Day would enable them to shoe their Horses once a month, & he thinks would be suff[icien]t Ind[ucemen]t to draw them out voluntarily, that the Cont[inent]'s shoeing the Horses would be liable to great Frauds & In[jury] to the Continent. That from Novr there were employ'd in this State from 120 to 150 Waggons-Volunteers & so on till the middle of April when the Demand encreas'd to the Westward of Susquehannah-That about the Middle of May the Col. granted Warrants for 100 Waggons from the Counties of Philadelphia & Chester-of which only 7 are come in. About the same time they granted blank Warrants to General Sullivan for as many as he thought proper to press for pub[lic] Service. Knows not how many were obtaind on these. That about beginning of May Warrants were granted for 40 Waggons beyond his q[uota?] which have been got-knows not whether press'd or Vol[untee]rs but believes the latter. That there are no imprest or Vol[untee]r Waggons from this State with the Main army-nor have been during the Winter, except such as are before mentioned to have employed voluntarily to carry up supplies & immediately to return again. That the Reason of employing so few Waggons from this State in carrying up supplies even during the Winter, was, that he sent up such Quantity of supplies to Trenton before the navigation was stopt as rendd any greater Land Carriage unnecessary-& after the Winter contd. the Transportation in the usual Channel. That the Transportation from Trenton during the winter was wholly perform'd by New Jersey & continues to be so now.

7361,dg01355,1779,Henry Laurens Notes,"""Henry Laurens' Notes   11th June, 1779. Never was there a more droll scene exhibited in a public assembly than the foregoing.(1) Almost every man who voted for detaining Mr. Deane, did so JUNE 11, 1779  from a hope of securing a vote for recalling Mr. Lee. When this should have been effected, Mr. Deane was to have obtained \""the special permission of Congress for departing from the United States,\"" or it might be that he would depart without the \""special permission,\"" \""for who could control him\"" (said Mr. S. and J. p.).(2) Such sentiments were expressed by both parties, which warrant this suggestion. To these and similar expressions I replied in Congress: \""If Mr. Deane in defiance of the order of Congress shall depart the United States, it will be pleading guilty, and upon Mr. Lee's appearance before Congress and giving evidence against Mr. Deane, judgment will go against him by his default; and I believe neither this nor a future Congress will hazard that public resentment which would follow a permission to Mr. Deane to depart, before the appearance of Mr. Lee, unless from captivity or other extraordinary accident he should be detained an unreasonable length of time.\"" On the other hand, those who could not bear the idea of recalling a faithful servant, and subjecting him to the risk of being captured and carried into England, whose king and ministers of state are exceedingly exasperated against him, and who also suspected the designs of the opposite party, therefore voted against their wishes to detain Mr. Deane, because the recall of Mr. Lee was tacked to that article as an express condition. Thus were votes given by all, three or four excepted, against the principles of the voters. My sole motive in bringing forward the proposition for detaining Mr. Deane and ordering Mr. Lee to appear and support his charges, was for obtaining justice- 1st. To my much injured Country. 2d. To individuals. The proposition originally sprung from myself, although Mr. Burke reduced it afterwards to writing, in order, as he said, to try if gentlemen were in ernest. He never found me otherwise. Before I had voted against the recall of Mr. Lee (on the [8th June, 1779],(3) see the journal), I had repeatedly declared in Congress that I would vote for his recall, provided Congress would detain Mr. Deane, and this opinion I have invariably supported in private conversation with Mr. Lee's brother, and other particular friends, in opposition to their sentiments; 'sfiatjustitia ruat ccelum,\""(4) was my governing principle. Thank God, I have acted agreeably to the dictates of my conscience, without respect to persons, and I trust my country will not condemn my conduct.

7363,dg01357,1779,James Duane to George Clinton,"""James Duane to George Clinton   Dear Sir, Philad. 12th June, 1779. Your Excellency has been pleased to desire an unreserved correspondence on measures which may occur to me as advancive of the interest and honor of our State. It is a fruitful theme for speculation, and I shall obey your commands with the utmost pleasure, being fully persuaded that an honorable peace, and a wise internal policy, will render us one of the greatest and the happiest people in the union. The security of our territorial rights, in which we have made great progress, and the speedy cultivation of our rich and fertile frontiers are the principal objects-objects which in my opinion call for the immediate attention of government. The pressure of heavy taxes on an exhausted and suffering people is the evil most to be dreaded. Our waste lands afford a natural and certain fund for their relief: nor is there any impediment but that the right of soil, in sufficient quantities, remains to be transferred from the native proprietors to the State. This I will always maintain ought to be done, not by fraud or lawless force, but on just and equitable considerations. I consider then that the hostile tribes, who, without the least reason or provocation, and in violation of the ties of treaties, gratitude, and humanity, have destroyed our citizens, plundered our substance, and desolated our country, are bound to make us full and adequate reparation. This they have it in their power to do by an assignment of a territory commensurate to the amount of the damages we have sustained in the loss of lives and property together with an equivalent for all our actual expenses in opposing their ravages, and the consequential injuries to our husbandry, &c. An estimate may readily be formed of these various damages, critical exactness being unnecessary, and a demand made of equivalent territory as a righteous preliminary to peace. At this distance I cannot decide whether it is in our power to fortify and take possession of the country of the Onondaguas in right of conquest: but if practicable it is clearly justifiable in good conscience and by the laws of nations. And Surely, Sir, it is worth a strenuous exertion at the expense of the State, if the Commander-in-chief should not think it such a general concern as to render it a continental charge. I do not mean that any faithful Onondago Should suffer a loss of his right of Soil; it will be easy to discriminate. Violence or injustice will deprive us of national character and the blessing of Heaven!  JUNE 12, 1779  Sir, in my opinion, the first plan which I have Suggested is recommended equally by sound policy and self-preservation. It is confirmed by the example of our Southern brethren. The Indians are sufficiently Sensible of the value of their lands. No other consider[atio]n will keep them within the bounds of humanity or good faith. Let them know that hereafter they shall part with their inheritances for their transgressions; and they will be cautious of unprovoked hostilities. I flatter myself that the venal and disgraceful System hitherto practiced, of courting and bribing them to lay down their arms after the most wanton barbarities will never be revived. Let justice be done to them as reasonable beings: but let them know that they Shall not injure us with impunity. This alone can secure our future tranquillity; especially if Britain should retain Canada on a pacification. I do not recollect whether I have touched on this Subject hitherto; if I have, your Excellency will pardon my earnestness from its vast importance. While America is in arms is the Season for reducing these savage neighbors to reason and a disposition for lasting peace.(1) The present operations promise more decision in every quarter of the Continent than any ever yet undertaken; and I wish our State may stand ready to avail ourselves of every favorable event. The accounts from the Southward are highly interesting. Lincoln, it is said, is victorious, and the British detachment completely ruined. From various quarters this great event is rendered probable; but Congress has no despatches hitherto. In our State I hope we are prepared to baffle the designs of our enemies, though I have the most sensible feelings for the distress of individuals. You, Sir, will allow for my anxiety for my family, and enable me to return with honor to my own State as soon as possible. I never yet thought it consistent with my character, and the confidence placed in me, to leave my station without the consent of my constituents. This dutiful respect to government has exposed me to a disproportionate share of exile, and my family and private affairs to great distress and disadvantage. But I comfort myself with the reflection of having done some public good, and studied to do all in my power; and that I have served a people who will honor me with their esteem which is my highest ambition. I have the honor to be-with the utmost respect, Sir, your Excellency's most obedient and very humble servant, Jas. Duane P. S. Pennsylvania and Maryland, without waiting for the opinion of Congress, have given their officers half pay for life. Is it impracticable to know the sense of our state on this subject? It is an important one, and will probably be soon debated.(2) I wish to please our Legislature; but ignorant of their views often hazard more than is prudent by acting from myself.  ""

You will learn from Brother Robert (2) more particularly than I have written, the Reasons which obliged me to continue a few weeks longer in a painful Seperation from those I so tenderly love: if I know your Heart they will melt with your Approbation, but I shoud be happy to have it under your Hand. I am obliged to think myself of some Importance in the Councils of my Country, and that the State of our Treasury and other publick Concerns called loudly on me to suspend my Journey. I hope they will soon be in such order as to Justify my Return; which I shall enjoy with more Honour and Satisfaction as I daily expect the Indulgence from our Legislature having the Governour's promise by a late Letter to make Application for me as soon as they shall Assemble. Altho' the Enemy have again penetrated our State I do not think you have the least Reason to be apprehensive. On the Contrary I have, under God! the highest Confidence that they will repent it, and return to New York with Loss and Disgrace. In South Carolina we have Reason to believe the British Troops are totally defeated & [skin'd?], & that we shall repossess Georgia in a little Time: While the Savages receive Chastisement in every Quarter and will probably be reduced to beg a Peace and give Satisfaction for the unprovoked Hostilities they have committed; In short our Affairs wear a pleasing Aspect and we may Justly hope that this Campaign will prove the last Struggle for our Liberties and Safety: These Reflections my dearest Polly will, I hope, compensate for all the disappointments we suffer. Let us be comforted with the Expectation that the happy Hour is swiftly approaching when we shall enjoy the Society of each other and of our Friends in peaceful Security and in heartfelt gratitude to the divine Being who has preserved us from so many dangers.

7366,dg01360,1779,Henry Laurens Notes of Debates,"""Henry Laurens' Notes of Debates   12th June [ 1779] On reading a Report from the Treasury recommending Returns to be made by each State of taxes collected Monthly,(1) I remarked, that however this might be complied with in other States it by no means applied to that, to which I belonged, unless this mode of collecting Taxes had lately been altered. Delaware (Mr. McKean) said that State had already paid into the Public Treasury her quota of the five Mill[ion an]d fifteen Million Taxes, and had passed a Law for collect[ing her part of the? for]ty- five Million (2) which would be paid on the 24th. Mr. Drayton exulted on this information [that?] as our little sister Delaware had so chearfully and punctualy paid in her Taxes, there was good ground for hoping that larger states could do the same (this pointed at a declaration which I had just before made, as my opinion, that South Carolina had not and would not have in the State within the 1st January next so many Millions of Dollars, as her Continental taxes amounted to 1,800,000 part of 15 Million 5,500,000 45 Million (besides her quota of 6 Million for sinking fund). I replied my Colleague should consider that Delaware altho' she was a little Girl received five times as much for her Commodities as JUNE 12, 1779  South Carolina did for hers, & that the quota of Delaware was in proportion to her size. Mr. Drayton as if he had totally forgotten my cordial Communication to him the 19th May, or as if such communication had never been made, moved from his Chair, and came next to mine, where he said it would be proper he thought, that I should state the disproportionate prices of the Commodities of South Carolina and those of the Northern States in order that we might lay them before Congress in order to reason thereon for lowering our quota of Taxes. now what can I call this, less than matchless effrontery?

The Prizes you will order into the nearest Ports addressed to the Continental Agents in those Ports. As we have received intelligence that a number of the enemys Privateers is cruizing to the Southward near the Latitude of 36 in expectation of intercepting the Merchant vessels bound from the West Indies to Chesapeake Bay and this Port, you are to use your endeavours to frustrate the Designs of our enemies, by Capturing or destroying as many of those Privateers as may be in your power and by Affording every aid and assistance to the inward bound vessels particularly the Brigantine Baltimore Captain Read which is loadened with Continental stores and dayly expected. As the Object of this Cruize is to take or destroy the enemies Privateers or small Ships of war and to give every aid and Assistance to the Merchantmen, you are to confine yourself Strictly to the Latitudes above and to such Longitudes as are best calculated to answer that purpose, but if from circumstances it should happen that the public service necessarily requires you to exceed those Limits, then you are at liberty to do it. We have given Similar Orders to those now given you to the Commanders of the Confederacy and Boston (2) whom we expect you will fall in with during your Cruize and in that case we Order you to  JUNE 12, 1779  join them and Cruize in Concert uniting with them your best endeavours to execute these Orders.

I wish the schooner you mention may be safe, but as she left Baltimore a little before the British fleet arrived in Chesapeake Bay, I am very apprehensive she fell into their hands. I find by the New York papers that the schooner Arnold has found her way to that place: this vessel was bound for Boston to the Navy Board with flour and iron-several other vessels are gone that way which we have heard nothing of however I hope some of them will arrive. If those people who have money so plenty as to give 50 dollars for a yard of gauze and who I suppose indulge in every other luxury would place their money in the funds and thereby prevent the necessity of further emissions, the complaints of depreciation would in a short time cease. Congress are doing every thing in their power to remedy the evils-three days in the week are constantly devoted to that business, but their endeavors will be in vain unless they are supported and assisted by their constituents. If there is not virtue enough in the people to support the credit of the money, there can be but little dependence on their virtue to support the army without money. False ambition, and avarice, are the most powerful ene- JUNE 12, 1779  mies to public virtue-let those base passions be suppressed and a fair field will be open for the display of Patriotism and every other noble principle on which the happiness of mankind depends. You say \""mankind are in general such infernal ungrateful beings that it seems but right that nine tenths of the world should be kept in order by force.\"" I have transcribed this short paragraph for your further consideration, on which I mean not to comment-the disposition you have shewn in opposition to tyranny and monarchical govt convinces me of the impossibility that you can really entertain sentiments repugnant to every principle of Republicanism. You ask what shall be done with the Tories-my answer is short, banish them and by that means put it out of their power to do mischief to this country, and perhaps some of them may possibly be in a small degree useful to some other Community. 15th June. Yesterday arrived here a ship of 24 guns and 80 men formerly belonging to Liverpool-she was sent in by the Boston and Confederacy.

I went there in full expectation of meeting Mrs. Fell and my Son there, but was disappointed, as the Enemy Prevented their coming at the time JUNE 13, 1779  they intended. As to the People at large complaining of Congress for the depreciation of the Money is a false System, for in my opinion the Real cause is the want of Virtue in the People. We have been long trying to fall on some Plan to Raise this Credt. of the Money. (You do not seem to like the Taxes,) we have Resolved to borrow on Loan 20 Million of Dollars, with some advantagious Offers to the lender? I hope you will approve of this Plan. I am truely, and very sincearly sorry, that you have Resigned your Office.(2) I hope it is not from Peak against any Particulars, however I will not enter in to your motives, till I have the Pleasure of seeing you. Do you not think I had a right to complain of my Collegues, I think I undoubtedly had. I also complain'd in the same Letter of the Parsimonious behaviour of the Assembly in the shamefull allowance they give their Delegates and gave them time to Provide themselves, as it was not Possible for me to support the expence longer then I had engaged for. I observe Mr. Houston is appointed, but I suppose he will not come till Dr. Witherspoon returns from his Embasy to the State of Vermont.(3) It realy gives me great concern to find you so much dissatisfied with the Proceedings of the State.

Decr. 6 1778, recd. Feb. 16th 79 answered the 17th-Sepr. 26th. 1778, recd. March 4th 79 answd.

London Gazettes told us the first part; and it appeares strange that neither Doctr. F., Mr. L (4) nor you have hinted this matter to us lately if you did not avow it authoratatively. We have some wise men here who are sure they could fish out all the Court Secrets. In the various Attempts to pull down A L to make way for some one to go from hence \""who knows all the present Circumstances of America & therefore could negotiate properly,\"" your want of Ability to give us Information such as we wish or fancy can be had is said to spring from the Suspicions of the french Court respecting One of you; and Some thing like an Attempt to dictate to us a Choice has been seen here. An Extract of a Letter from the Count d V____s has been quoted, Je crains Mr. A L et ses entoures (5); and we are tempted to think that therefore the Communication beforementioned came through Mr G____. But this is different from what was once the Conduct; for Mr. Deane tells us that he was directed to tell Doctr. F what he did not chuse to tell Mr. Lee, or, as he wishes to have it believed, which he was forbidden to tell him. I am persuaded Doctr. F would not readily disgust the french Court in such a Point. If there is any Seriousness in the Business, I suppose the Court stood upon the punctilio of not having the Compliment of a minister Plenipotentiary returned at that Time. Mr. Lees Enemies have produced nothing but Innuendoes to procure his Removal, while they dare not deny his Integrity and Abilities in our Service. Mr. Deane says the Lees are not fit for Transactions with a \""gallant\"" Nation. But doubtless those Men who want his place would be very gallant indeed on certain Points in Negotiation: The eastern States are charged with wanting what they have no Right to and what is of \""no Interest to the southern States.\"" Plenty are these local Sentiments lately; and R. H. L. with H L____ns (6) are squinted at as two monsters on the other side of Susquehanna who pursue points in which the southern States have no Interest. Would France or England reason thus on the Fishery?

Why did I vote for your name to be inserted Apr 20 page 10? A Majority against me had before resolved that the Names should be added-that Doctr. Franklins should be inserted but did not proceed by Yeas & Nays therefore I was entrapped not having my Nay appear on Doctr. F cou'd I say nay to Deane the Causa malorum. and as it was not mutual Suspicions &c. I could not exclude you who was suspected & stigmatized in the Report of the Committee, tho' more to the disgrace of Mr. Izard than yourself, if there was any disgrace in the Circumstance of his imagining that your Connection with the Eaters & Distillers of Molasses had warped your Judgement against the Interest of other Parts of the Continent. Mr. Izard has good Testimony to his many estimable Qualities but his best Friends say he is irascible even when he has not a Fit of the Gout as he unfortunately had when he was writing of Doctr. Franklin, and proba[bly] too when he made his Strictures upon your Opinion of the 11th & 12th articles.(7) Every Appearance is that you will not be passed over without honorable Notice when the Report receives its finishing Discussion.

Previous Question on the 1st Part, Yeas & Nays by Mr. Laurens, 5 a[yes], 5 n[ays], 1 dividd. Yeas & Nays by Mr. Holton on the 1st Part,4 a[yes],4 n[ays], 3 dd. Previous Question on the 2d pt. yeas & nays by Ellery 11 ays. The Term recalled having been used with regard to Wm. Lee & Rph. Izard, with an Idea strenuously supported by some of bringing them to America though others who were affirmative meant only vacating Commissions, a 2d Resolve passed That it is the Sense of Congress that Mr. Wm. Lee & Mr R Izard need not repair to America.(3) I give them no oficial Notice now,(4) nor shall I without the special order of Congress, because, I am again left alone of the Comtee. of for. Affrs. Yr. Brother R H having resigned as I hear, and gone home; and further because something definite ought to be decided in regard to Compensation for Services of the Commissioners. An Attempt has several Times been made lately to chuse a new Comtee instead of filling up the old one. This you will perceive to be singularly decent towards the one who has steadily attended. Nay it is said that such a Comtee. is useless. I am sure I find an immense Deal that ought to be done and a great Burthen in what has been done by a Member of Congress without Secretary or Clerk, little as you & the other Gentlemen abroad may have been benefitted by my Labors.(5) Quires of my Writing have been sunk in the sea, most of it near these Capes. I expect further Attempts to get rid of you. It was a Fear of that and a Strong Desire to scrutinize Mr. D (6) that made Mr. Laurens I  JUNE 14, 1779  imagine give into the late Motion.(7) But I think you will rise above the Malice of the Faction which you have long known, or, if you find yr. Usefulness destroyed by their accts you will readily tell us so, and desire to make way for some other Person. I have by me large Packets left by your Brother with Copies of Proceedings affecting you, but I will not venture them round about, as a Frigate must soon go directly from hence, or at least a Pacquet boat. I tell Mr. J Adams more on that Head. I suspect much Roguery in the Stoppage of yr. Letters; how else is it that we have not a line from any of you? Mr. S Adams goes home Tomorrow for good and all, as he says.(8) This is intended Via Cadiz, a Copy Via Martinique.

7374,dg01368,1779,James Duane to George Clinton,"""James Duane to George Clinton   Dear Sir, Philad. 14\"" June 1779. Your Excellency's Letter to Congress respecting the Revolt has made a serious Impression. (1) I applaud the wisdom & Spirit which it manifests. Congress seem to have relied rather too far on the Moderation and Passivity of our State: and yet there are Circumstances which Justify their proceeding with Caution. It is generally supposed and believed, that if active measures are passed by our State, the Friends and Relations of the Revolters in the Eastern States, even in defiance of their own Government, will Support them by JUNE 14, 1779  arms: At the same time an opinion prevails that, by the mediation of the Committee, they may be prevailed upon to return to their Duty; at least that the attempt is necessary previous to acts of Violence. The Eastern Delegates seemd Confident of its Success and were explicit in avowing their wishes that it might produce Submission & Tranquillity. Your Excellency's Letter is committed to a special Committee, & I presume they will report that the Prisoners be set at Liberty & Col. Allen's Conduct as an officer of the United States be submitted to a Court Martial.(2) At the same time Congress are so strongly perswaded of the policy & propriety of sending their Committee, that they will persevere in the Measure, & I wish our State coud be so far reconciled to it as to give it no Obstruction. If the Committee are disregarded it will become the Cause of the United States: & we shall have a Right to call on Congress for Assistance to support their own authority. I suggest these hints for your Excellency's Consideration, and remain with the utmost Regard, Dear Sir, Your Excellency's most obedient & very humble Servant, Jas. Duane. [P. S.] No Express from the Southward! The great Events there still depend on uncertain Rumour. Reprinted from Clinton, Papers (Hastings), 5:84-85. 1 JCC, 14:721.

7376,dg01370,1779,Thomas Johnson,"""Thomas Johnson   Dear Sir Philadelphia June 14th 1779 There have been so many accounts by different ways of the defeat of the Enemy at Charles Town, that a man must be an infidel not to believe it; yet Congress have not had any Public Letter on the occasion, nor has any private Letter from South Carolina, informing of that happy event, been received by any person that I can hear of in this City. The Enemy have looked at Fort Arnold, & fell down the River 40 Miles, to Kings Ferry, and are Fortifying on both sides of the River. It is said that the Reasonable a 64-exchanged some Shot with the Fort, and that she was dismasted. It is a misfortune to the States, that Congress had not recommended the recruiting Service at the beginning of the Year. Charles, was always a spirited County and I am pleased, that it still continues its exertions. Crops are very promissing throughout the Continent, and could our Money be prevented from further depreciation, we should have nothing to fear; but if, it continues, God only knows what will be the contingent event. The States have it in their power to apreciate it something, but there are so many speculating individuals, that will counteract every public measure, that I dispair of the wished for success. Could we assure the States that there would not be Emissions beyond a certain Sum, the business would be done-but as Congress is uncertain whether sufficient Supplies will come into its Treasury by Taxes or Loan, the Press must be kept going so long as the Money will purchase any thing, or at least till supplies can be otherwise had. I think you have judged right, in not convening the assembly before harvest, its very probable few would have attended had you attempted it. This moment came to Market Street wharf a Privateer mounting 24 Nine pounders fitted out of New York, owned by Liverpool, Captured by the Boston frigate, it is said there are 90 men on board of her. With my respectful Compliments to Mrs. Johnson, I am Dear Sir, Your Excellys affectionate Servt., Daniel of St Thos Jenifer 15th. P. S.

7377,dg01371,1779,James Duane to Philip Schuyler,"""James Duane to Philip Schuyler   My dear Sir Philad. 15h. June 1779 I this morning had the pleasure of your favour of the 5th Instant. Mine of the 1st May I concluded must have miscarried led into this Belief by your usual punctuality and Attention to your Friends. I greatly differ with you in your Conclusion from the Acceptance of your last Resignation.(1) Your best Friends in Congress were firmly perswaded that your Determination to resign, in every Event, & under every Circumstance, was fixed unalterably! and that you woud be obliged, and not hurt by, the Acceptance. You may be assurd you stand very high in the Esteem of three fourths of the States & Members of Congress: No inconsiderable Proportion, considering how much pains have been taken by the factions to injure your Reputation! I tell you once more that If you had communicated to me your wishes, instead of making the second absolute Resignation, any reasonable Vindication of your Character-if any after the honourable Acquittal by your Peers, & Confirmation by Congress, was necessary-coud have been obtained. Do not therefore blame Congress, who have enough to distress them, without the Reproach of their Friends: nor suffer Chagrin to disturb you when Glory is out of the Reach of Malice. And your Enemies put to Silence & Shame. Much less be prevailed upon to retire to Privacy 'till Peace & Safety are established. Let our own Private Feelings be sacrificed to our Country. And Let us be contented with the Approbation of our own Consciences. Far, my dear Sir, be it from your Thoughts to resigning the dearest Concerns of our State, involved in the Indian Department. Can any thing be of so much Importance to Us? Who is able to succeed you? Will you give place to Men unacquainted with the Business? To Strangers, perhaps to ______s(2) of the State? What will your fellow Citizens say? What your warmest Friends? But if so this Step shoud be precipitated before we can find a proper Successor it will be inexcusable. I mean to assist you in executing this most important office till we can put it on a proper footing. I will then, with you, chearfully resign it: for it is impossible you can be more heartily tired of a publick Character than I am. This is a Period in which we may expect decisive Regulations and lasting Security with respect to our Savage Neighbours. Very probably they will soon Sue for Peace: but more than verbal Submission & fair promises ought to be exacted. Since they unprovoked & perfidiously have committed Ruin & Devastation upon our Frontiers: we have a Right to a full & adequate Compensation for the Loss of Lives, Property, Time, Husbandry &c &c. They are able to make it by assignment of part of their Territories. It must be insisted on-not only as an Act of Justice & Retribution for past Injuries: but as a  JUNE 15, 1779  point of Policy & self preservation. Let them know that they shall always pay dearly for their Ravages: & that their Inhabitants shall answer for their Depredations; & you will have some due tax upon them. At present you have None. Fond of Blood, & destitute of principles, there is no dependence on their most solemn Treaties. I have written my sentiments to our Governor on this subject. If approvd the Execution will remain with you: & it is a work of delicacy & difficulty which will require all your Experience & Abilities, & to which, without exemptions no man but yourself is equal. The goods you requested are certainly purchasd: and you will find it a seasonable & handsome Assortment for our Indian Friends. Every Aid you request will be granted, the greatest deference being paid to all your Recommendations even by those who do not love you. I will mention the delays of the Quarter Master to the Board of War. I feel most sensibly the depreciation of our paper money amidst all our golden prospects. We are striving hard to reestablish its Credit. Certainly it is within the Compass of human wisdom & our present powers: if the Legislatures & People will Act with a Vigour & disinterestedness Suitable to so great an Emergency. You will have heard the agreeable Report from the Southward. Congress have yet no official Inteligence which restrains our Joy. You have another Visit from Sir Henry Clinton.(3) But as we are prepard to meet him, I am not apprehensive of any deep Impression. I have a violent Fit of the Malade du Suisse! And have requested Leave of Absence from the Legislature. Col Floyd is already returned without that Ceremony. One of my first wishes will be to meet you for Much have I [to] talk of over a friendly Calumet. Adieu! And believe me ever, Dear Sir, most affectionately, Your Obed. huml. Servant, Jas Duane [P.

He will also give you the whole of what has reached us yet from 5th. Carolina, touching the good Fortune of Genl. Lincoln. But these Considerations would not acquit me to myself if I neglected thus early to acknowledge my Obligations to you for the obliging Expression of your \""Desire to be considered as my Friend\"", contained in yr. Letter of May 30th which reached me the Night before last. Be assured, dear Sir, that you have hereby liquidated a full Page in my Book of Sufferings. There was a Season when I counted upon Thousands & Tens of Thousands; but, for several Months back I have been fully persuaded that all my Hazards, Toils & Watchings were to be recompensed by the Approbation of a virtuous Few. I wish the \""unusual Anxiety & Weight upon yr. Spirits\"" may be thrown off so far as it was occasioned by the Ultimata which are one time or other to be debated here: I cannot but think a decent Coalition would take Place among such as it is supposed will differ, from local Interests or varied Degrees of Resolution. I believe our Ally intends well for JUNE 15, 1779  us. But such Belief does not warrant the laying aside political Watchfulness: Nor should the Exertion of this occasion any Disgust in those who feel themselves to be thoroughly well intentioned. If, after Conversation with Mr. S. A. you wish Informations may be sent from this Place respecting the Result of Points not quite decided when he left us relative to Cod & Hadock, I will endeavor to give you all the Satisfaction My Circumstances will allow. You will always consider the Distinction between catching & drying being Rights with widely differing Foundations. As to our money, it cannot be mended but by stopping the Press. Taxes, if the States should even comply punctually with our Recommendations, which their past Conduct does not warrant us to look for, will not answer by themselves. We are about to borrow 20 Mills of the People on probable temptations. But can we offer Interest in exact Proportion to Exchange to such Persons as now may be disposed to lend, and not pay the same to those who have formerly lent. I think not. We did equal Justice when we offered Bills on France. We must do the same at this Time. Give 6 per Ct. conditional, to rise in Proportion to the Quantity in Circulation at the Date of the Certificate and the Due of Interest;(2) as, unavoidably, Something of an Emission must go on, till we are otherwise supplied. For my Part, I think such a Measure would alone be sufficient to obtain much Money. Some Thoughts are suggested of holding the Principal till the Currency shall be 1/8 appreciated; but this is holding up no Temptation, for, if the Press is stopped, the Appreciation would inevitably be 1/8 in a very short Term indeed. If the \""Sacrifice of Consistency\"" which you justly notice was made in a Case where there were Abilities of a Size to produce any great Events, I should be more chagrined than I am at observing the public want of a republican Delicacy in the Case stated. I am sorry the Opportunities for Holland were not the Carriers of my Letters as I have been unlucky here. Our worthy Friend John Adams must think I neglect him in his very odd Situation. We are ripening towards measures which must induce an immediate & definite consequential Disposition of him, and I have no doubt of an honorable one. As to the Assents and Dissents in our tragicomical Journals, the Grounds of them are hard to be fathomed; and the Case you mention is a very delicate one;(3) I dare venture, however, to say that it is not to be accounted for by Want of Honesty, but rather by the Quantity of that Species which puts us off of Guard against the Arts of designing Men. By hearsay or conjecture you are become so much master of my Situation, that I shall have no great Fears of your Reproof, if, feeling half as unwell from Watching as I do at present, I shall, now and then, omit a direct Return to your kind Correspondence. I slight my Feelings, at this Time, to prove my ready Acceptance of the Inter  course to which you so pleasingly have provoked. Your most humble Servant, James Lovell ""

I yesterday received your very agreeable Favor of the 6th instant,(1) and am much gratified by your Confidence & Approbation, for, be JUNE 15, 1779  assured my Dear Sir, there are, in public Life, few greater Consolations than to stand well with those, whose unvarying Conduct, through the whole Course of such a Contest as ours, bespeak and prove them the great and the Good. The Plaudits of such Characters will always be Food to the generous Mind, and the Defence and Support of them the spontaneous Effort of every patriotic Spirit. We have done no great Things since you left us, however as Determinations have been made respecting some great Characters on the other Side the Water, I will give you the best Account of them from my Memory, as I have it not in my Power at present to apply to the Journals . On the Questions, \""Shall Mr Izard be recalled?\"" \""Shall Mr. William Lee be recalled?\"" they both passed in the affirmative by a small Majority. Each of these Questions, as soon as determined, was succeeded by this Proposition; Resolved that it is the Sense of Congress, that Mr. Izard, Mr William Lee, be not required to repair to America unless convenient &c. or words to that particular Effect; and the said Proposition respecting them both passed also in the affirmative: so that those Gentlemen are left entirely at their own Option.(2) I cannot omit to mention, that we had many curious & learned Debates respecting the Meaning and Definition of the Word \""recall,\"" and I at one Time apprehended the Result might have produced the Necessity of a Correction in most of our modern Dictionaries, however in Time it being wisely judged, that, although we might determine, that by recalling a Man we meant that he should continue where he was, and should even proceed so far as to publish our Battalia of Yeas and Nays upon the new Definition, yet our Constituents, who seem to have abated of their implicite Confidence in us, might not fully accord thereto, it was thought best to proceed in the Manner I have before related. Next came on an excentric Attack upon Mr. Arthur Lee in Manner and Form following; Mr. Burke, seconded by Mr.-say Smith,(3) tho I am not quite certain, laid in the following Proposition, vizt. \""Resolved, that Mr. Silas Dean be directed not to depart the united States without special Permission of Congress and that Mr. Arthur Lee be ordered forthwith to repair to America &c:\"" After much Debate, when the Question was about to be put, a Division was called for, and the previous Question moved on each Part of it. On the first Part the previous Question was lost by a Division, and by a peculiar Turn of Providence the main Question shared the same Fate, and after all his Enemies Maneuvres, when the previous Question came to be put on that Part which respected Mr. Lee it obtained almost unanimously, and to their utter Mortification he remained in Statu quo. Whether they will venture at any future Time to renew the Attack I know not, if they do I hope we shall place this Business on better Ground than a base Division, as I think Rhode Island, New   Jersey and Delaware will pretty generally hereafter stand fair-Mr. Marchant is arrived here, I expect Mr. Houston from Jersey in a Day or two-Mr. McKean is in Congress & Mr. Van Dyck hourly looked for. Contra-Doctr. Witherspoon is gone on a Mission to Vermont and our Friend Mr. Adams sets off for Boston this morning. I ought to add respecting Burke's Proposition, that on the main Question for Detention of Mr Dean in America, The Yeas were New York, Virginia, North & South Carolina, The Nays, New hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Pennsylvania-Rhode Island, New Jersey & Maryland divided, Delaware, Mr. Dickinson, not present- the Reason you may conjecture. All the Difference from the above State, if applied to the previous Question, was that Mr Fell voted for the previous Question, and Mr Henry against it-whereas on the main Question Mr. Fell voted ay, and Mr. Henry Nay, which divided both the States to the utter Confusion of &c. &c. &c. after it had been audibly declared, \""all hollow,\"" \""all hollow.\"" Thus are the crafty taken in their own Devices. and I suppose Mr. Henry will undergo a severe Gauntlet for so sacreligiously subverting their political Babel. We have not as yet appointed any new Ministers, nor have we any foreign News of Importance. I seriously apprehend some new Folgery (4) has arisen to thwart our Advices. We have not yet been able as yet to ascertain the Evidence of Doctr. D____ (5) as to Communication of signing the Treaty to London, he being gone on the western Expedition; and we cannot discover who the Person is in this City to whom he attended; however I hope in a little Time through Mr. Sergeant or Mr. McKean to obtain satisfactory Information, when I do, I shall make the best Use of it here, & immediately communicate it to you. I congratulate you on your Family's Escape from the Depredations of the Enemy, tho I lament the Ravages they have committed in your State; I wish Providence had suffered a less severe Jogg to have awakened you. I also congratulate you on the glorious Successes of our Friends in South Carolina, & I hope Georgia too, tho we are not yet freed from the pains of Suspense by any regular Express from that Quarter-I however am sanguine enough to hope for an entire Burgoyneage alias Prevoage (6) of the british Army in that Department. The Enemy are gone up the North River in Force and have possessed themselves of, & are fortifying King's Ferry. The Boston & Confederacy yesterday sent up a fine prize Ship of 24 Guns, with Stores & Provisions on Board for a long Cruise. Want of Time & Paper conspire to prevent my adding any thing further at this Time but that all Friends are well, and that I am with high Esteem & great Sincerity your Friend and most Obedient hum ble Servt.

Yesterday a Report was brought in by the Treasurer to give Mr. Storey Emoluments similar to those in the secretary's office here to a first Clerk.(2) But it was judged that ill Consequences wd. flow from setting a Philadelphia mode for Boston Salaries; therefore the Matter was referred back to My Lords to take order.

At the same Time it is inconsistent with the Office I hold to appear on the Public Stage agt. every one who shall amuse himself with Defamation. Be not however uneasy for your Friend. I venture to assure you that he will rise from the Stroke and pity the Envy of his Foes.

It would give me great Pleasure to fix upon some Scoundrel the deep Lie and open all his Infamy to his own View.

The Proposition as follows.(2) That it is essential to the welfare of these United States that the Inhabitants thereof at the expiration of the War should continue to enjoy the free and undisturbed exercise of their common right to fish on the Banks of Newfoundland and other Banks and Seas of North America, preserving inviolate the Treaties between France and the said States.(3) That an explanatory Article be prepared and sent to our Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of Versailles to be by him presented to his most Christian Majesty whereby the common right to the said Fishery be more explicitly guaranteed to the Inhabitants of these States than it already is by the Treaties aforesaid. That the said Minister Plenipotentiary be instructed to obtain in the Treaty of Peace with Great Britain a stipulation on their part not to disturb the Inhabitants of these States in the free exercise of their common right to the said Fishery, and that he be authorized to make a reciprocal engagement on the part of the United States. That the faith of Congress be pledged to the several States that without their unanimous consent no Treaty of Commerce shall be formed with Great Britain previous to such stipulation. That the explanatory Article should not be satisfied by His Most Christian Majesty, nor the Stipulation adopted by the Court of Great Britain the said Minister Plenipotentiary be directed to give notice thereof to Congress and not to sign any Treaty of Peace until their pleasure be known.  JUNE 19, 1779  Debate on the first Clause from 1/2 past 11 to 1/2 past 3 oClock- adjourned without determin[ing]. In the course of debate Mr. Gerry who upon a former day had warmly censured the North Carolina Members and others who had unwarily disclosed that they had consulted the Minister of France on the Article for securing the Fisheries avowed that he had now in his turn conferred on the same subject with the Minister. *Mr. G. Morris said our pretended private business was no secret, it was known and talked of in every one of the States. Mr. McKean confirmed this as to every County Town in Pennsylvania.* Mr. Laurens rose and said I speak to privilege. \""Mr. President, I find this business has been spoke of without much reserve aboard, one gentleman acknowledges that he has conversed on it with the Minister of France, we know that several others had done so before him-another Gentleman informs us that our pretended private business is known and talked of in every one of the States.

Virginia, claims the most, if not all the Indian Lands that have been Sold over the Ohio which makes the Title to these Lands the more precarious. Congress are endeavoring to re-establish the Credit of the Paper Emissions, & will, it is probable do a great deal towards accomplishing of it within a few days. The Speculators may probably Counter JUNE 20, 1779  act this Salutary measure. Taxes will be exceedingly high, I suppose Lands will fall, in that Case the Purchasing of them at not more than 5 or 6 for one would be advisable. I can add but little to what I before said as to the Land Chas. Ridgely wants to purchase of you. He probably would perform any promise he might make, but if he should be called hence, no bargain you could make, I fear would bind his Executors, and upon the whole were the Land mine I would keep it. The treble Tax will soon be taken of[f]. And upon a peace Lands will rise, especially in Baltimore County. Gold is commonly rated at £3.17.6 per oz. but has of late years Sold in London from £3.19. to £4.2.6.

7402,dg01396,1779,William Whipple to Josiah Bartlett,"""William Whipple to Josiah Bartlett   My Dear Sir, Philadelphia 20th June 1779 You may well think it strange that we are so long without intelligence from Europe a circumstance that I cannot accot for, unless we may suppose there has been many miscariages.(1) Your distress on account of the Currency is not to be wondered at, it is really an object of great concern & demands the most serious, & diligent attention; three days in the week are devoted to that business, & I hope a plan will soon make its appearance that will dispel the glooms that now over[s]pread the countenances of Americas Friends. You ask where Genl W and his army is, I can only answer that they are in the Neighbourhood of Hudsons River; the movements of the Enemy on that River and of our army in consequence, you undoubtedly have a history of, before this time. It is surprising that we have no authentic intelligence from S. Carolina since the 9th May, when undoubtedly very important events have taken place there, since that date, the reports (which are many) all agree that a general action has happened, & that we have gained a compleat victory, the  JUNE 20, 1779  particulars are hourly expected, perhaps I may have the satisfaction of inclosing them in this letter. I believe the drawing of the Lottery is nearly finished but my attention has been so much engaged in other matters that I have not thot. lately of making inquiry. I suppose the Genl. Assembly are now setting & I hope somthing will be done respecting the Grants, New York are continually pressing to have that Business drawn to a conclution and insist that there shall not be a seperate state but will acquiese in any other mode of settling the dispute. I think it of importance that N. H. shod lay in her Claim and send some person here, well informed, to support the claim, shod that Country be added to N. Y. she will be a powerful, & I am apprehensive a troublesome Neighbour. I know you must have important business before you, but this is an object of such magnitude, as in my humble opinion demands the earliest attention.(2) I have been for a long time, daily expecting a Colleague but am still without one; you are not unacquainted with the disadvantages I must necessarily labor under, for want of assistance. When I left home it was my intention to return in May, but as I am determined never to turn my back upon difficulties I have no objection to continue here, till those we have now to encounter are conquered, but must confess I think it hard that I cannot have the aid of a Colleague both the Lee's have taken leave of Congress. The Dominion now makes a very indifferent figure, but I understand there are some appointments which, (when they arrive) will place that state in a more respectable point of light. It is not an agreeable thing to see a state devided, that has never yet been the case with N. H. but will it not be the case, when the two last chosen Gentn. appear together? Unanimity is ever desirable in public Councils but never more necessarily, then at the present day, besides the disadvantages to the public, it must be very disagreeable to any Gentn. to be opposed by his Colleague in Office. I think these considerations ought to have some influence in the choice of public Characters. 22d. Col. Peabody arrived last evening, I find by him that I am not mistaken in my conjecture respecting him, and his intended Colleague,(3) cannot something be done to prevent the evils that may be the consequence of a division of sentiments? I am happy to hear You have such promising prospects of a plentiful Harvest, from all accots. there never was so great an appearance of plenty in this Country as the present season affords. Will not these distinquished marks of the favors of Heaven, dispel our Glooms, and animate us to co-operate in the promotions of our Countrys happiness & in that way shew, Gratitude to divine Benificence. The Boston & Confederacy have sent in here a ship of 24 Guns & 95 men (a private cruising ship) & it is reported this morng they have taken the Delaware & destroyed another ship of war, but this wants  confirmation. I hope shortly to have it in my power to give you such information as will tend to dispel the Clouds that seem at present to intercept Your happiness-in the mean time be assured that I am Your very sincere Friend &c, W.W.

June 1779 I have received your favour by Mr. John Pollock and am much Obliged by that circumstantial account of our domestick affairs which you have given me, and on the whole See that we have great cause to be thankfull. Poor Robben, many a pleasant ride he has given us-I suppose he can yet draw in the Plow or Waggon, and think you had better keep him till near the Fall. Ceasar must be careful of him. The person to whom I Spoke for the Timothy Seed, is a Mr. Walker near Mr. Linns at Bigg-Spring, three or four Quarts will I presume be sufficient & Soon enough to Sow it in September unless the keeping down of Grass & Weeds may answer better in August. I am told that Mr. Hall at the Works has been very friendly in keeping an eye to our field, for which he deserves our thanks-and also That Ceasar  JUNE 21, 1779  has been very careful of it. I am my dear very much concerned at what you Say respecting the Harvest, and well remember I also used to feel too much anxiety about that matter, Ours is but Small, I think the Plan I proposed for Cradeling it is the best & will give you the least trouble-perhaps Mr. Alexr. Blain may be able to Spare you three or four Gallons of Whiskey at any price he has paid for it, Speak early to him. If we cou'd be so happy in Congress as to get a few principal points Settled, I shou'd please God soon return home but Such are they in their nature & so many are the interruptions that I can not possibly fix on a time, without soon returning back, which I cou'd neither well approve nor well acomplish. I have no doubt of Johnny's (2) being well, tho' some of his letters may have miscarried as I recd. none from him for Some weeks. I received One letter from the Doctor (3) & no more, which I inclosed to his brother, but none from Coll. Chambers, perhaps he is not yet come down-if he is at Camp I shall write to him. I cannot immagin that any mistake fell out with me in my Sisters Money, as Mr. McClane who Changed it for me of money of his neighbours which he was that hour to put into the Loan Office and my Self both counted it twice; and returned it & the Doctors both in the Same papers or Covers in which I recd. them-how much does She Say is wanting? Through Some pique or pet of South Carolina, we have yet had no account of the affair at Charles town by Express, and Genl. Lincoln is I suppose too busy to write having as we Suppose intercepted the Return of the Enemy to Georgia or inclosed them on Some Island on the Coast, but there is no doubt that the Enemy were at least repulsed in makeing their attack upon Charlestown, but with what loss we cannot yet assertain. I inclose Mrs. Irwins letter for greater Safety as it contains some money-from her you will hear the Situation of the Enemy and of our Army on the North River. I have purchased Some Coffee & Sugar & may possibly get it up Soon. I am my dear love, with Respects to all friends Affectionately Yours.

7405,dg01399,1779,Charles Carroll Sr,"""Charles Carroll, Sr.   Dear Sir, Phil. June 21st 1779. I am obliged by your favor of the 8th. It is true, that I said, I wished Congress had determined with precision on their ultm. in February. This Sentiment might be construed to imply, that the Enemy had made proposals. It also implies, that other Powers might request our ultimatum Should a Negotiation take place in Europe; that they might know, how far it might be necessary for them to go. But I must so far explain my former Letter (1) as to assure you, that Britain has not made any direct offer, either, to Congress, or to our Ally that I know of. I wish the offer you mention was made openly and directly; if it was, I am of Opinion it ought, & would be accepted. The people at large, have it in their power to prevent the further Depreciation of our Money, by Lowering the prices of the necessaries of life, but I do not wish the Apreciation to be raised. The Sums Emitted are trifling, compared with the present high prices of the produce of the Earth, should these advance, God knows where we can Stop, for we must go on emitting, as long as our money will pass for any thing-Gold has fell from 25 to 15 for one within three weeks. But Goods Sell for 8000 Per Ct. advance. Surely it would be unreasonable that such enormous Profits should be made equal to Gold & Silver in the hands of Speculators, Harpies, & Scoundrels to whom the most of our misfortunes may be attributed. The true Patriots Scheme is very concise, & would perhaps answer the End he proposes had we peace, but I fear to adopt it just now, would throw the States into such a Convulsion that everything would be at a stand. But if a person could get as much for one Dollar as he could for 20 the injury would not be great, indeed those persons who have money by them received for old Debts would Suffer, but  JUNE 21, 1779  then, their other Debts would be made good by it and upon the whole the Public, & chief of its individuals would reap great benefit by such a measures being adopted. I have enclosed you a State of our Emissions to this time, by which you will perceive that immagination has greatly encreased the Sum of Paper in Circulation. I voted against requestg 45 Mills I thought 30 Mills in Add[itio]n to the 15 before requested would be as much as could be collected from the people, I know that Maryland cannot raise more than her Quota of 45 Mills in the course of the year, unless Money continues to depreciate as rapidly as it has done for some time past. Our Commissioners abroad accuse each other and were we to believe what they say, it is high time that they were all recalled. Mr Deane seems to have done more for us at the Court of France than all of them together. But it is said (whether true or false God knows) he has taken care to be amply paid for his Services. In all Public Assemblies there will be more, or less of party. But, I think there does not appear to be so much of it in Congress as I expected. I wish your Son could have been prevailed on to go to the Court of Spain. I think he would have been the instrument of restoring peace to America. His reasons for not undertaking so hazardous an employment no doubt are weighty. The Enemy still holds his Posts on the North River at Kings Ferry. But has not made a single incursion, perhaps Deterred by our General who has taken Post within 12 Miles of this Ferry; or it may have been prevented through fear of Desertion, which now prevails. Our Brave, Great, & Good Commander in Chief (whom God long preserve) has thanked, and discharged the Militia of the State of New York, this evinces that he is strong enough without them. General Knox has visited our Forts on North River & Reports them to be in a good State of Defense & that the Enemy on both sides of the River he computes to be, between 6 & 7 thousand & it is his opinion that Genl Clinton will return with his Forces to New York. If the Carolina News be true, America is triumphant. Congress has not received a scrip from that Quarter since the 5th. of May- Nor has it received the least intelligence from Europe since the last of December. It is said the Count D'staigne has left Martinique. I am (with my respectful Compliments to the Ladies & your Son), Dear Sir, your most Obedt. Servt.

7409,dg013103,1779,William Fleming to Thomas Jefferson,"""William Fleming to Thomas Jefferson   Dear Sir, Philadelphia; 22d June 1779. Your obliging letter, without a signature, came safe to hand. As JUNE 22, 1779  letters frequently miscarry between this & Virginia it was a good caution, which I shall take the liberty to follow. That peace & the independance of the thirteen states are within our power is a point not well established;(1) but thus much I think myself at liberty to say, that Congress, long before my arrival here, were called on to declare on what terms they would consent to a peace?-and to fix their ultimatum. They have been debating the matter ever since, & have not yet come to a point, tho' I think there is now a prospect of that necessary business being shortly finished. The difficulties have mostly arisen in the East, but have been supported from the south side of Powtomack; tho' much of that support is now withdrawn. The extreme delay in this business necessarily gives great uneasiness to the French minister, but that he was about to return to his own country in disgust is not true. This climate is very unfavourable to his constitution, and he had it much at heart to leave it before the hot season came on, & now only waits the determination of Congress on this important business. He thinks there have been combinations to break the alliance, & to throw America into the arms of G. Britain, on her acknowledging our independence, in which opinion many have joined him; the ratification of the treaty, therefore, by the Virginia assembly was highly pleasing to him, as I doubt not you will see by his letter acknowledging the receipt of it.(2) A few members of Congress who got intimation of the ratification, expressed their dislike to the proceeding, as being against the spirit of the confederation, tho' nothing was publicly said on the subject. However, I am of opinion that the occasion warranted the measure; and I think it high time for Virginia to look to her own importance and to provide for her own security, in case of disunion. I am pleased to hear the measures taking for putting our finances on a better footing, that being the most tender ground on which we stand. Congress are wasting much time on the subject and I am clearly of your opinion, that it is nonsensical quackery. Their resolution of the 2d of January last, calling in the two emissions, is a proof of it.(3) General Sullivan has about 4000 men on his Indian expedition, of the success of which few, I believe, have very sanguine hopes, especially since the commissary of provisions laid before Congress the generals requisition for extra provisions, signed with his own hand; a copy of which I inclose for your amusement.(4) We are informed that John Dodge is on his way to Virginia. I will not congratulate you, but my country, on their choice of a chief magistrate. It will break in on your domestic plan and you'll find it a troublesome office during the war. Please to present me very respectfully to Mrs. Jefferson. Farewell. [P.S.] It has just occurred that I must liberate this letter to save the postage.   ""

I am pleased with the effectual measures taken by your State to raise so much by Taxation, it shows a Spirit worthy of imitation, youl see by the inclosed Papers how the reformation Plan begun in this City before you left us is spreading through this & several other States. I hope it will produce great good. I wish I could give a good prospect of some valuable conclusion on our finances, but so long as the power of evading, perplexing & delaying the most patriotic propositions is allowed to a certain few, we shall do nothing timely that is fit & proper to be done.

I find your absence does not entirely free you from a Squib now & then such as, if that Gentleman was or had been as well known in Virginia as I know him he would not have been continued a Delegate so long. By the enclosed resolutions you'l see how very little has been done, no Stop put to the Commissions of Quarter Masters & Commissarys &c than which nothing has or possibly can occasion the depreciation of our Money more rapidly, only think of a two penny Jack who never in his life was capable by any business he had been engaged in, of making a Shilling more than maintained his family & that but in a very so so manner, shall now be making 40 or 50,000 per annum & that by lowring the value of our Money & raising the prices of every article he purchases, a truth acknowledged by all & yet the mischief suffered to go on & encrease, as though some were afraid to Stop it least they themselves may be injured in their connexions.

I take it to be this, The people of South Carolina not knowing our Circumstances may possibly be somewhat piqued at Congress because we have not sent them a large detachment from our main Army, and therefore will not write until their temper come down from that undue pitch to which their mistakes have raised it. General Lincoln, nor the troops which were with him, not being in the Action, but busily employed as we presume in intercepting the Enemies return to Georgia, may not Send any Express until the event of the whole be known. The most probable account we have is that the Enemy were Surrounded in an Island not far from Charlestown but that they were repulsed in their attack upon that Town is beyond all manner of doubt, altho' the numbers they must have lost in attempting to force our trenches are not yet fully assertained, a Short time we hope will bring us a good account of them. You will Observe in Some late Resolve of Congress that the Characters of all the Qr. Masters & Commissaries are not held in the Same point of view, but that just & necessary distinctions are taken in order to take off that Odium that had like to have been indiscriminately thrown on the whole.(2) No alteration has yet taken place in the JUNE 23, 1779  arrangement of these two great & expensive lines, and if there Shou'd, no man must resign before the end of the Campaign at the peril of his honor & reputation. I hope the measures almost ready to be published will at least soon put a Stop to the depreciation of our money. Will my Young Lofty fetch 12 hundred pounds, they give from that to 15 hundred here for a horse not near so good-I am with Compliments to Mrs. Davis & friends at Carlisle, Your very respectful friend & humble Servt. John Armstrong [P. S.] Mr. Blain is in health Mrs. Blain not so well as cou'd be wished- She is to go to the Salt Water Soon by advice of the Doctor.

7425,dg013119,1779,John Armstrong Sr to George Washington,"""John Armstrong, Sr., to George Washington   Dear General. Philada. 25th June 1779 I am for Some time possessed of your Excellency's favour of the 18th Ulto. and perfectly convinced of the truth & importance of the contents, but have & shall punctually observe that degree of reserve, which is equally just as it can be agreeable to your wishes.(1) You are not mistaken when on a late amplification of certain powers, you immagin Congress had an eye to something particular or out of the common road.(2) The fact was this, that we were taught to believe the return of the Court DeEstaing to our Coasts before this time, JUNE 25, 1779  and that by the assistance of his fleet, you will not be Surprized that flattering & new manuvres Shou'd be formed in embrio, and the event of his coming be followed with hostile attacks on the Enemy at New York & Rhode Island-those Saguinary ideas so far operated on the minds of Some Gentlemen as led them to move that your Excellency shou'd be directed to recall General Sullivan &c. but these motions were So far over ruled as to leave you to the Exercise of your own judgment on the Campain at large. But upon what grounds we were amused with the coming of the Count, and why these hopes have so nearly died away are matters that to me requires some farther explanation. The business of Finance altho' not yet finished according to the System proposed, has nevertheless passed sundry Stages apparently proper, and from which I expect at least a Sudden period to the depreciation of our Money, indeed the mere expectations of the populace, altho' our Resolutions have not yet appeared joined to the efforts of the sundry Committees in this State have not only prevented a farther depreciation but have actually lessened the price of sundry of the more essential articles of life. Foreign affairs continue to perplex & Procrastinate-Who Shall be the great men Over the Water, and whether a Common Right in the Fishery shall like other Claims of right & convenience be made an Ultimatum in case Britain shou'd offer to concede our Independance-or whether the Fishery, at least for the present Shou' d be left to the effect of Our Ministers Negociation, are Subjects of tedious & disagreeable debate. It may be feared these points are blended, the business itself, and who shall transact it-whosever wishes to be the Minister, may wish the latitude of Negotiation. Others apprehend the risque might be too great in the hands of a Minister-however this important matter may be, many things unjust & impolitick have been said & propogated upon it (I mean the Fishery), by making unnecessary Obstacles about it, giving it an undue & unatural weight in the business of Peace, as tho' it should be the only Synequanon of Great Britain-and if left on the easy footing of Negociation, at least Oblique insinuations have been held up to the people that we might have our Independance conceded to us whensoever we please & might have had peace before now &c. Thus has the true grounds of the debate been much Shaded by a parcel of falce hipothesis & delusive Stuff. It is also true that Several Gentlemen far removed from any expectation or wish to go to Europe, think the fishery ought to be left to the best terms the minister can make about being of Opinion that it is not essential to the Well being of these States, that the Eastern States only or more principally must be gainers by it, and lastly viewing it as the only hinge upon which Peace or War must turn-in this light I confess I am neither willing nor able to conceive it, believing that the real Springs of Peace or War must arise from Sources considerably differ-  ent from that of the Fishery. The Army is also a Topick of great consideration, I mean it's Smallness & dissatisfaction-glad wou'd I have been to have had it taken up in a Series or chain long ago, but our unpardonable or at least unaccountable delays on other business has prevented that design which I'm persuaded if not early attend to must undo our cause. The business of half pay for life of which I have been fond as the best compound of justice & gratuity to our Soldiery, I find will meet with more Opposition in Congress than I had immagined: many declaim against the policy of that measure, but say they are ready to agree to something tantamount, by reducing the necessaries of life to a moderate price, and making the pay good from the begining as tho' there had been no depreciation; which of these modes Congress ought to adopt, I am at a loss to know, but wou'd gladly urge the best. By a letter of the 6th Inst. from Captain Kearsley I'm pleased to find he is returned to the Service & gone up the Susquehanah to joine the troops with Genl. Sullivan. Kearsley I take to be one of those Officers who will do his duty from Principle, and make no doubt a line from your Excellency will at Once please & fix him.(3) Our Reputed Success on the 11th of May near Charles Town becomes more & more doubtfull, and may probably turn out to be only a change of Rout or manuvre, upon wch. Polaskey has charged & somewhat harrassed their rear, yet may we have some good news from Genl. Lincoln, altho' the Enemies Possition Said to be in an Island must render his access difficult. The Enemies acquisitions of place on the North River are very interesting & must call the attention of the States to Strengthen the Army, of which I'm afraid little to purpose can be done before the Winter. With perfect respect I have the honor to be, Your Excellencys Affectionate, humble Servt. John Armstrong(4) ""

We are of Opinion that between the Latitudes of 36 & 41 and 100 leagues Eastward of the Island of Bermuda will be your best Cruizing ground, but in this we do not mean to restrict you, leaving you to excercise your own judgment which probably may be asserted by information which may be obtained in your Cruize. All prizes which you make you are to send to the nearest or most convenient Ports of these states addressed to the Continental agents. You are to continue Cruizing for the above purposes until the middle of September next or longer if your provisions and other circumstances will admit of it and afterward return to the port of Boston where you must be governed by the orders of the Navy Board of the Eastern Department. We have ordered the Continental Frigates at the Eastward to be sent out to Cruize for the same purposes you are now going on, and we think it very probable that you will fall in with them. In that case you, or they, or any of them are hereby directed to cruize in company under the command of the Senior Officer; and should you be joined by any of those frigates, and find by any intelligence you may receive of the situation of the enemies Sea force at Bermuda that it will be adviseable to make an attempt on their shipping, we recommend your undertaking it. By late Accounts from that Island the Virginia Frigate and a privateer out of London mounting 20 Nine pounders were the only vessels of war then there. We now wish to draw your most Serious attention to the execution of the business before you-the great expence and dificulty that attends the fitting and manning of our Ships must make you and every Commander in our Service fully sensible how much they should exert themselves to employ them usefully while at Sea. This consideration we hope will have due weight in your mind and will call forth such Active & prudent behavour as will be of essential Service to your Country, and add to your Own reputation and the honor of our flag. We wish you health & Success, and are sir, Your very hble servants, By order, Wm. Whipple  P. S. The Confederacy being designed for a particular Service, we have ordered her up here.(2) Messrs.

We have recd your Letter by Mr. Sessions, and are exceedingly concerned, at this last Disturbance that has happened as it may be a means of defeating all our Endeavours for promoting Peace;(1) We are not willing however to consider it as a Breach of the Agrement you made with us because it is probable it was not known, or distinctly understood, but was surprised to find that though Sessions was to have carried a Copy of both Letters yet he had only ours and  JUNE 28, 1779  not yours. We shall therefore only signify that in our Opinion the Agreement will be wholy frustrated unless you not only put a Stop to any further Proceedings of this kind, but cause Restitution be made to the People whose Cattle have been seized in this last Instance.2 You must be sensible that unless this is done it would be absurd to desire them to send their Levies for the want of which they have been fined and are supposed with time to have made Compensation. We Trust you will manage this matter with all possible Prudence, and may expect to hear from us again after we have seen Govr Clinton. We are &c. J. W. S.J. A. [P.

7441,dg013135,1779,Henry Laurens to Horatio Gates,"""Henry Laurens to Horatio Gates   Dear sir, Philadelphia 29th June 1779. The revival of a correspondence with General Gates a Gentleman for whom I have long borne an affectionate regard affords me a singular pleasure, I am convinced of this fact from my feelings at the unfolding your favor of the 22d. Inst. I shall endeavor on my part to merit a continuance of your attention. The gloomy prospect of affairs in my native Country which had been held out some six weeks ago & the late flattering accounts from that quarter, have undoubtedly had their proper effects upon my mind, but not in the extreme in either case-when it was supposed that So. Carolina would be, from a want of proper & timely aid, conquered by the Enemy. I lamented the distressful state to which Women & Children would be reduced, but I felt no pain for the supposed loss of my own Estate. I knew that Man might be happy if he pleased without riches, & hope of a recovery buoy'd me on the surface of a well tempered resignation. Admitting the present intelligence to be true, that we have routed & completely conquered the Enemy, I view it as a second Saratoga event, but I must prepare to receive impressions which will certainly be made by a detail of the loss of dear friends & fellow Citizens whose lives have been staked against the breath of brothels, lanes & alleys, & I must expect, seeing the thirteen United States cannot or will not repair the damages sustained in that one, to see a more formidable & better conducted attack upon it, made in October or November next. Rivington informs his credulos readers, that So. Carolina is wholly subdued, & I dare not possitively contradict him, because I have no clear proofs for confronting his lies, had even Charles Town been conquered we should before this day, have seen fifty living witnesses of the fact; at least that number of Itenerant Jews, Turks & Infidels, who have been compeled to remain in Garrison, would have fled helter skelter to Philadelphia as an asylum-why we have not circumstantial information is easily accounted for, General Lincoln had a great work to do & he could not with propriety speak until it was done. I was the only Man in Congress who had not given up all belief of the conquest at Saratoga when the Conquerors regular advices arrived at York Town-the only information we have received directly from the capital of So Carolina is under the hand of Doctor Ramsay of the 18th May in a Letter to Mr. Peale, a Copy of which will be found within (1)-had this been brought to me ten minutes ago, it would have saved you the trouble of reading a page & half. I have with great attention perused the papers which you referred to & I find to my great mortification that I was too well warranted in saying to Governor Rutledge a few days ago, \""the tottering state of our Army.\"" I have long seen & often said, the States are asleep &  JUNE 29, 1779  nothing will reanimate them but a convulsion. There are great faults elsewhere, but that dog Rivington may again catch my Letter & manufacture from it, one, suitable to his own palate. Besides, you know all. I believe my Dear Sir, you must be content with a paper medal & a consciousness of having merited one of a better quality until Gold shall become more plenty, & yet the whole would be a mere trifle; heedlessness & want of reflection are the causes of many good & necessary businesses lying a sleep. When I write to Colo. Laurens, he shall be informed of your very kind remembrance, poor fellow he received a bullet through his right arm at the head of 200 Horse, took his sword into the left hand, kept 400 of the Enemy at Bay, killed their Major Commandant, two Captains & 6 or 7 Men, & secured his retreat with the loss of two Men killed, himself & three or 4 more wounded-this relation I received from a sensible french Officer who left Charles Town the 8th May. Mr. Laurens was then abroad on Horse back. Accept Dear sir my best wishes & the repeated assurance of being with very great Esteem & Respect. Your most obedt & most humble Servt. Henry Laurens. ""

Nicholson we have had the Honor of receiving.(1) The Circumstances of Capt. Nicholsons Captivity was not new to us, but the answer from the Marine Comttee. as represented by Capt. Nicholson is altogether so. As the Members of this Comttee. and every other indeed, are frequently changing, it is impossible to know with certainty what verbal answer was given to Capt. Nicholson, by the Marine Comtte. On the report of the Navy Board; but from the Minutes of the Comttee.(2) we are inclined to think he is mistaken in the representations he has made to you. What an individual of the Comttee. uninformed upon the subject might have said to the Captain is impossible to ascertain; but the Comttee. as a Comttee. could not give him the answer which he says they did; for no third Witness is requisite by the established mode of trial on a Court of inquiry, and therefore it is unreasonable to suppose the Comttee. could inform the Capt. that it was requisite. There must therefore be some mistake in this Matter which you will readily perceive by reading the enclosed resolves of the Comttee. in which they approve of the report of the Navy Board and speake of him as a spirited and good officer. We are not unacquainted with the Merit of this officer, and as soon as a Ship offers we shall use our endeavours to provide for him, but at present we have a greater Number of Capts. than Ships, and of Course it is out of the power of Congress or the Marine Comttee. to employ the whole of them. Your Letter respecting the powder and Canon we have laid before the Board of War.(3) They had a few Days before the receipt of it sent a person for both these Articles-He must have been with you before this Time. If he has not, we request you would not dispose of the powder as it is much wanted by the continent. Congress has had no Confirmation of the various reports respecting our Southern Success. In a letter from Charles Town from a Gentleman of rank and abilities, as late as the l9th of May, no mention is made of any action. The Enemy did no more than appear before the Town and return again. They are at present in the Neighbourhood of Charles Town & the New-York paper says in possession of John & James Islands. We are Sir with the highest respect and Esteem your Excellencys obdt. & hble.

(1) We have not failed in the most pressing Manner to urge for a Determination upon Our Application; but the Flood of Business at the Treasury Board has hitherto delayed a Report. We expect one in, to Day; and shall avail Ourselves of the first Opportunity to obtain a Determination of Congress thereon. Mr. Ellery has waited some time in Hopes of the Business being concluded;(2) he will wait a few Days longer in hopes of carrying a Sum of Money with Him: But the very great Expence the State are at in the Support of their Delegates he apprehends will not justify his tarrying much longer was the Necessity of his being at Home and the Circumstances of his Family less pressing for his Return. We could have wished Our late repeated and Seemingly well founded Accounts from Charlestown So. Carolina had been better grounded. However by private Letter from thence dated the l9th of May We are informed the Enemy had approached the Town & demanded it,(3) but being absolutely refused the Enemy had retired; But an Engagement was daily expected between them & Genl Lincoln who was Superior in Force to the Enemy & very near them. The Maryland Paper says that by a Contl. Captn. they are informed that on the 29th of May an Engagement had taken Place between Genl. Lincoln and Gen. Provost at Black Swamp when the British were totally defeated. Having been so much deceived heretofore we are almost affraid to give Credit to this Account, but wait with Impatience for Authentick Accounts from that Department. Reports from the West Indies & Europe are very favourable. We wait however for Confirmations, And in the mean Time remain Your, Excellency's most Obedient and very Humble Servants, William Ellery Hy.

Treasury And the Determination of Congress if possible to stop further Emissions. The Allowance for the Black Regiment raised by our State is not yet adjusted.(2) Nor have we greatly urged it at present-As the States at the Southward have not as yet complyed with the Recommendation of Congress in Raising Regiments of Blacks. It will be well that we should be furnished with the Amount of what that Regiment actually cost the State, that if we should not be able to obtain the Sum lately allowed by Congress for raising like Regiments to the Southward, we may at least obtain the Sum that Regiment in Fact cost the State. The Abstract of the Account, first put forward & lodged in the Treasury of the State agt. the United States has been mislaid. We should be glad Mr. Mumford might be instructed to make a Copy; it being but a few Sheets, & send it forward as soon as may be. As Mr. Ellery proposes to set out in a few Days he will be able to explain more fully the Reasons why we could not at this Time obtain a further Grant. Perhaps at some, not distant, Period, if the Taxes should come in with Spirit and it would be agreable to the State to take an Order on the Receiver, it may be obtained least for near the Ballance of our Account.

Clarke of which you have seen the printed Account, and the defeat and Capture of Lieut Governour Hamilton (2) renders that Event still more probable; while the present vigorous Operations against the Senecas and Cayugaes will with God's blessing reduce it to Certainty. In this important Transaction there is no State so highly interested as that over which your Excellency presides. It is very near my Heart that we may be prepard to receive and improve it's Advantages. Stranger as I am, from an almost perpetual Exile, to the policy and Measures our State is pursuing, it is with pleasure I obey your Command in communicating my Sentiments on such subjects as are particularly interesting to my Fellow Citizens. I have observed a want of attention to our Indian Affairs in our Legislature who seem totally to have leand on the Continent for every provision; not appointing A State Commissioner Agent or even an Interpreter to attend to our own immediate Interest with Nations who reside within our Jurisdiction, and upon whose Conduct our Happiness eminently depends. This is not the Case in the Southern States. Nor woud it be prudent. Consider Sir that if an Accident shoud happen to Deane the Agent for the Contl Commissioners We shoud not have a Person in our State competent to the Business of conducting a Treaty; & for him we are indebted to Connecticut & hold his services by no particular Attachment. With respect to Commissioners Accident has given some Security, three of the five being Citizens of our State (3) who while they pay a faithful Regard to their general Trust have an opportunity of securing the just Rights of the State. If it shoud on this Account be thought unnecessary to appoint State Commissioners, at least let our Attention be carried to suitable resident Agents. What I have in View is to select out of our Battalions two young Gentlemen of Sense and military Talents, to give them the Rank and Appointment of Majors at the State Expense, and under Obligation of Residence & to acquire the Language of the Indians. Watch over their Conduct. This office must always be necessary & the provision ought to be permanent. Consider in how many Views they may be useful. I only mention the Land Office and the Indian Trade: If these were not sufficient I might add the greatest of All motives, the Safety & Tranquillity of our Frontiers. I shall not at this time trouble you on any further Topic; except a Word for myself, which is to request that your Excellency will be pleased to put it in my power to return home with at least your Approbation. I am really worn down with Anxiety & hard Application, tho' I endeavour to bear it with apparent Chearfulness.

I would most chearfully acquiesce in Britons keeping their American Possessions, and maintaining their Common Right of Fishing on the Banks of Newfoundland. Your observation is too true, that we have delayed recruiting our Battallions & sinking our Money beyond the time we ought to have adopted these measures. However, I am not without hopes that the States will exert themselves. If they do not, we are an undone people. Congress expects to raise 20 Millions on loan immediately over and above the 45 Mills. I am afraid Congress will not recommend to the States the repeal of the Tender Bill-I have mentd. this matter to some of the Delegates, who speake of the ill consequences that might attend such a measure, to be sure to put it in the power of Men to pay their Debts with the 20th penny is unjust. Congress have not recd. any information from South Carolina since the 5th of May. Mr. Drayton has a letter from a Gentn. in Chas.

7451,dg013145,1779,John Dickinson s Notes,"""John Dickinson's Notes.   [June ? 1779] (1) The first Question to be determined, is, whether the borrowing Continental Money to be repaid principal and Interest in Gold & Silver at a certain Rate & at a certain Discount, or borrowing Continental Money to be repaid principal & Interest in the same Currency, will be the easiest Mode to the Inhabitants of these States.  JUNE 30, 1779  The second Question to be determined, is, whether, the former Mode abovementioned being adopted, it will be most advantageous to the Inhabitants of these States, to borrow on Condition of repaying Principal & Interest at the End of one Year, or on Condition of paying Interest annually & repaying the Principal at a distant period. As to the latter Mode above mentioned, will it not impose an enormous Burthen on the people which will continually encrease by the growing Appreciation of our Currency by Taxation, & thereby even become insupportable? Will not the profits to the Lenders encrease in the same proportion, and thus the Industry & Care of a vast Majority of the people be constantly employed in adding Riches to the Creditors without Diligence or Attention on their part and yet incessantly multiplying in their Hands? Will the Majority be contented for any Length of time to labour under these Circumstances? As to the former Mode abovementioned, no Gentleman has propos'd any Scheme for taking in Money by subscription for Bills bearing Interest payable annually, the principal to be repaid at a distant period, at any higher Rate than eight or nine Continental Dollars for one silver Dollar, yet it is acknowledged, that the Rate of Exchange is from 12 to 15 for one, if not more. If then a Fund can be procur'd to pay Bills for principal & Interest at the End of a Year, and a sufficient Quantity of Bills can be disposed of, this Method is preferable to that of Subscriptions. But to this Method two Objections lye-first, that We cannot procure such a Fund-secondly, that We cannot dispose of a sufficient Quantity of those Bills, if we had the Fund. As to the first Objection, the Distinction must perpetually be preserved in national Councils between Difficulties and impossibilities. This very War is a striking Verification of the Distinction. It may not be convenient to our Ally to advance a principal sum, tho it may be to advance a smaller one to pay Interest. But We have, it is apprehended, other Resources. In Holland, & Switzerland, influenced by a sympathy for those who are treading in their Steps to Freedom & Independence, & expecting Advantages perhaps by indulging those just Sentiments, and in Spain well disposed & interested to support Us, We may not unreasonably, it is asserted, look for Assistance on this Occasion. One, or all together may give Us the help we want. Suppose all together should fail to make up the humble desire, is it probable, We should totally fail? If We do not, will not the sum lent, aid Us advantageously as far as it extends? Allowing, We should totally fail, can We not by paying the Interest, by an additional Interest or otherwise make such Compensation to sellers, as to vindicate the national Faith?(2) As to the second Objection, it is apprehended, that if proper Quotas of the Bills are dispers'd throughout the several states, as Equity requires & the Exchange fix'd alike in all, very considerable sums  might be rais'd. The Quantity may be so proportioned, as to encrease the probability of selling them. Granting, that We cannot sell as many as We would, We may have a considerable profit by selling as many as We can. What Harm can the Attempt do? We shall know in a short Time, to what Amount We should negotiate a foreign Loan for payment.(3) Nor is this Mode at all inconsistent with that other of subscription-both may be tried together, or that of subscription immediately after the other. If tried together, perhaps the Views of different persons would be best answered. Mercantile people might chuse Bills payable principal & Interest at the End of a Year, for the purposes of Trade. Others might chuse to subscribe contented with payment of Interest for a Number of Years, & having that & the principal secured against Depreciation.(4) ""

A Letter from a french Officer John_(1) in bombast terms on the glorious anniversary of American Independence & praying Congress to employ him to exhibit certain grand fireworks on the 5th Inst. which he had prepared for the purpose. Mr. Drayton rose & in a funny declamation informed the House that it had been the practice of all Nations ancient & modern to celebrate particular days by festivity, that Greece had instituted the Olympic Games, these things he repeated again & again without [end?](2) & concluded by hoping the Man would be ordered to exhibit his fireworks. Mr. Laurens, rose, expressed his astonishment at the conduct of his Honorable Colleague, who seemed to be altogether joyous at a time when he thought he was loudly called on to serious reflection. Does not the Gentleman know that his own Country is bleeding at every vein & now probably reduced to the greatest distress? has not the Gentleman recently received a Letter informing him that all the Rich Planters in the Southermost parts of his Country are ruined? did we not yesterday receive a very alarming Letter from the Quarter Master General? have we forgot the alarming Letters from General Gates read at that Table but two or three days ago? has not the Commander in chief frequently informed us of the precarious state of existence in which our Army has for some time been? have we not held out to our Constituents that we were endeavoring to appreciate our Currency by lessening the quantity in circulation? is not every unnecessary expenditure the cause of increas'd emissions? is this the Honorble Gentleman's mode for appreciating our Paper Money by adding expence to expence & unnecessarily? If the Honorble Gentleman will shew me that the United States of Holland when they were in our circumstances & I beleive they never were less able to bear expence than we are, or the Canton's of Switzerland, plunged into expensive feasts for celebrating the anniversary of their Independence, I might be brought to agree with JULY 2, 1779  him-but I beleive he cannot produce any such Instances from their histories-their prudence, their ceconomy secured their Independance & their present happy establishment. The Olympic Games of Greece & other fooleries brought on the dissolution of Greece-my Colleague may think this a day for joy & mirth, I am of a different opinion, I rather think it a time for fasting & mourning, I speak seriously & I hope I speak properly-I move, the Letter may lie on the Table & no further notice be taken of it. This was loudly seconded. Mr Drayton replied, \""I would have Gentlemen when they talk of history discover that they knew something about it-the Olympic Games were not instituted for the celebration of anniversaries nor did they bring on the ruin of Greece, they were calculated for improving bodily strength-to make Men athletic & robust\""*-here he was called to order by several Members & to sit him down the Order of the day was called for & the Paper ordered to lie on the Table & generally exploded. *is drinking Madeira Wine from 5 to 9 oClock then sallying out to gaze at fire works, & afterward returning to Wine again, calculated to make Men athletic & robust? why then introduce the Olympic Games as an example for fire works.

7468,dg013162,1779,Franco American Alliance,"""Franco-American Alliance   [July 4? 1779] (1) The Basis of every Confederation, or Treaty, should be founded on the principle of equality, otherwise it will not be lasting. The present plan, which twelve States have acceded to, being partial, cannot Subsist longer than the present danger exists. If the present plan should be agreed to, and broke within three or four Years, Would not France and America be in a more critical situation, than if no general Confederation between the United States as to Territory had taken place? Would not Great Britain avail herself of every dissention that JULY 4, 1779  Portrait of Daniel of S. Thomas Jenifer  might arise between individual States? And would not these dissentions probably end in a despotism? To prevent this, Would it not be for the Interest of France and the United States, that Alliances should be made by France with each State seperately, as well as conjunctly? Is it not necessary for the well being of the United States, that there should be a disinterested Umpire, that each might apply to as a common mediator? And would it not be for the Interest of the United States that France should be that mediating power? Is it not for the Interest of France and the United States, that Canada should accede to the Union? And would not the present plan of confederation in all probability prevent it; great part of this Country being claimed by New York, and the New England States? Would it not greatly Cement the Friendship between France and the United States, that the Subjects of each should be made Denisons of the other? The United States having seperated from Great Britain and established their independency, it will be their Interest to remain for ever unconnected with a nation, who, for generations to come will not brook the dismemberment of her Empire, and will be continually endeavoring to regain by intrigue or Conquest, that, which by the greatest folly she has lost.(2) And therefore it consequently follows, that Great Britain and the United States must be natural Enemies. France and Great Britain being under the same predicament renders it absolutely necessary for the safety of France and the United States, that their Union should be lasting, and their utmost exertion made use of to humble the common Enemy. The United States have men and Provisions, and can carry on the War to any length of time, provided the Paper Money emitted (about 147 Mill[ion]s of Dollars) can be apreciated. Congress have requested the United States to raise 45 mill[ion]s in addition to 15 Mills of Dolls. before requested ie, 60 Mills in the present year 1779, and opened a Loan for 20 Mills. Should these attempts be successful, the United States must still depend upon France for Arms, Amunition and cloathing for the Army, the Money advanced for them with 6 Per Cent Interest, will be repaid at the End of the War. But if contrary to expectation, the Money should depreciate still further, the United States must be assisted by France, or Spain, or by both with 100 Mills. of Livres; for without such Loan, the War cannot be carried on, and the sooner our Ally is informed of this necessity the better it will be for both Powers.

These are infirmities of old age to peep thro' spectacles at pretty women in Church and to forget them the next minute. Shall I say that I mean to dine at home to day at my own expense because I hold it an exceeding bad means of appreciating our paper money to give eight or ten thousand dollars for a dinner, and because I think my constituents are already sufficiently taxed and also because the Anniver- JULY 5, 1779  sary of American Independance had been properly celebrated on the fine day by decent attendance morning and evening at Worship and occasional Sermons, to Say nothing of Te Deum and Music. Shall I speak of the distresses or deliverance of my native country. I have no certain accounts of either, this must be the subject of another day. I will confine myself therefore to Finances and beg leave to submit to your Excellency's perusal copy of a letter which I transmitted about a fortnight ago to a friend in a neighboring state. The low ebb to which our money is reduced, the notoriously tottering state of our army are alarming circumstances and cry aloud upon the existing United States for their utmost exertions in aid of the measures adopted or to be adopted by their Representatives in Philadelphia or for dictating wiser measures. Upon a serious and full review of our public affairs I am led to beleive that the call of a grand council composed of men renowned for Integrity and Abilities from each state assisted by the Commander in Chief and a few selected General Officers to take under their consideration the state of the nation to sit either in or out of Congress (in the latter case to call upon Congress for every necessary information) would have an happy effect;(1) These Committees which we see rising every day are Epitomes of the work I have in mind, but however good their views and intentions may be their Authority is usurped and may become dangerous to the safety of the People. Gentlemen who should be sent from the several states for forming this Council would acquire a Knowledge of many important circumstances of which the states are now profoundly ignorant, from their representations wholesome coincident Laws would be enacted in each state, without which it will be impossible for Congress to proceed in the discharge of public business. Your Excellency may ask why do not Congress intimate to the States the necessity for passing such laws? Sometimes it has been done and their recommendations almost totally neglected-or if the Laws were enacted Congress remain without information-besides to use facetious Sterne's exclamation \""Lord thou knowest whereof we are made.\"" The business of this Council might be begun and ended within two or at most three months, years and millions of money I apprehend would be saved by it. If this Sketch for reformation shall not meet Your Excellency's judgment, order us out of this sink of idleness and dissipation or order our doors to be opened that our Masters may discover what we leave undone. It is not expedient to say here every word which I might in private conversation but this I must say that our public affairs appear to me to be in circumstances truly deplorable and that much, very much, very much blame will light on some of the states whenever the day of reckoning shall come, and it will soon come unless some fortunate interposition from the chapter of accidents shall stave if off. Or finally be pleased  to give me your opinion of what ought to be done for opening a more comfortable prospect to the good People of America. I will not further trespass upon your Excellency's time but to assure you that I continue with the most sincere respect and esteem Sir &c. H. L. ""

In the instance you mention with regard to your bringing forward Lieutenant Brown to the command of the Diligence or the Sloop Providence we approve of it, altho' at present we are of Opinion it might prove injurious to the service to bring forward Lieutenants in any general way to the exclusion of Captains in the service who are out of employ for want of Vessels. We are very JULY 5, 1779  much pleased to find that the Providence, Ranger and Queen of France were ready for the Sea, and approve of the Orders given to the Commanders of those Vessels-we hope the Warren will shortly follow them. As Congress are endeavouring to make such regulations in the finances as will make the wages and allowances for Subsistance of all Officers more adequate to the necessary Expence, it is thought inexpedient at this time to encrease the Subsistance allowed by the Resolution of Congress of the 25th of July 1777 (2) We expect to have the case of the Ship Nancy Speedily determined (3) & are Gentlemen, Your hble Servants ""

Advice that I am continued in the Delegation to Congress; But the Terms are such as are very injurious to my personal Interest and Honour; and I am not certain that I shall accept of the Appointment on such Terms.(2) It is notorious that I have been concerned in Trade, for upwards of ten Years; and I could easily demonstrate that very few Men, in a Public Character in Virga. have made so great a Sacrifice of Interest as I have done since the Commencement of the present Troubles. I have not however been engaged in the Business of Speculation, as it is called. My Managers in Virginia have recd. Consignments from foreign Merchants & thence my profits arose. I have not even written a Letter to them on the Subject of Trade or given them any Advice since I left Virga. I wish that direct Measures only had been taken to remove me from Congress, and that no Option had been left to me. It would then have been necessary for me only to evince to my Country the Rectitude of my Conduct whilst in the Service of it. But my Enemies, not content with attempting to displace me by a direct Vote, have availed themselves of a circumstance to procure a Law which either JULY 6, 1779  removes me from Office or deprives me of a considerable Means of Subsistance. If I refuse to accept of my Appointment, I know the Use they will make of my Refusal to render me unpopular; and if I do accept of it, I shall add an Injury to those already done to my Children, which may be irreparable. Under these Circumstances, I must return to Virginia before the End of my Present Delegation, that I may consult with my Friends and take my Measures accordingly. I hope to be able to give the Genl. Assembly a clear & satisfactory Account of my Conduct, at their next Meeting.3 They will then perhaps be able to judge, whether my Views have been directed to other Objects than the Prosperity and Happiness of my Country, and whether I have merited the Treatment I have recd. The Man who looks into his Heart & finds himself free from Guilt, gains Strength from Opposition, and by a firm and persevering Conduct will sooner or later prevail against it. In my Absence, My Enemies may attack my Character & Conduct; but the Time will come when I shall meet them face to face, and it will be well for them if I do not make them ashamed.

His better reflexion however has led him to observe that Several other Officers in the same or a Similar predicament have found themselves Obliged to Submit to the decision of that Board whereby his principal Objections appear to be alleviated & his natural wishes to return to the Service again excited. This temper encouraged by any advice I cou'd give, has produced the following resolution, that if agreeable to your Excellency to grant him a Brevet as Lt. Coll or any other mode whereby that Rank may be reserved to him, he will chearfully Serve as a Volunteer or in any other way your Excellency may think proper to point out, until the next vacancy. Nothing but the importance of the present labouring Service wou'd justify my asking a line in answer to the above, whereby Major Nichols may be determined-nor my farther hint for One to Captn. Kersley at Wioming, knowing as I do the numerous & heavy avocations of the present hour.(1) I heard a good discourse the other day on these words-Be not weary in Well doing for in due time you Shall Reap, if ye faint not.

By a letter from Col. Laurens to his father the late President, of the 10th June we are Informd, that the Enemy appeard before Charlestown, & Summond the Town to surrender, threatning to Storm it next morning if they refusd but on receiving for answer that they Should not Surrender but were ready for them as soon as they pleasd, the Enemy retired the Same night, & when the Letter came away were Entrenched on the main near Johns Island, with their Sick & Invalids on the Island, they were said to be Sickely & in want of flour & Spirits. I fear they may be Sufferd to remain in that Neighbourhood until they are reinforcd, but Some think the Climate at this Season will do the business for them.

7490,dg013184,1779,to the Honorable Robert Morris Esquire,"""to the Honorable Robert Morris Esquire   Sir, Philada. 8th July 1779 You who have with such \""great reluctance venturd to claim the attention of your fellow Citizens\"" should have been tender of a fellow Citizen, who, as you have had occasion to know, feels, at least, a similar unwillingness to make an appeal in a Public News Paper. In your Publication of this day,(1) you are pleased to hold me up in the Character of an Accuser, not indeed by name, but all the Members in Congress & every intelligent Man in Philadelphia, know to whom you allude. Men at a greater distance will be informed; various conjectures & judgements will follow, & I hold it to be not very honorable to a Gentleman to become an accuser of his Neighbor & fail in his evidence.(2) You knew Sir when you were writing your address to the Citizens of Philadelphia, & you knew it many Months before, that I had not accused you that I had only related to Congress a conversation with one of your friends which had created suspicions of your conduct in the transaction of that business which you say \""brought against you a very serious charge of a criminal nature in Congress.\"" I had uniformly renounced the Idea of being an Informer or an Accuser in a matter of which I had no other knowledge, than the bare communication which your friend had made & I had signified to you that when I related the conversation to Congress, I was not actuated by a desire to destroy your Character that I had prefaced the relation in the following terms or in terms to the same effect-\""If the account which I have received be true the Public ought to be informed, if it be groundless Justice forbids that Mr. Morris should be kept in ignorance.\"" This declaration which I imparted to you in January last & the candid part which you acknowledge I have since acted, entitled me to a little candor & a little more decency from you. Had I been in your place Sir, & you in mine I would long since have thanked you, not in terms of half reproach. If you really beleive that Congress were perfectly & Unanimously satisfied with your conduct in that transaction, you deceive your self-there appeared 'tis true no proof against you of criminality but there were nevertheless more persons than my own clearly of opinion that the manner in which the business had been transacted, was, to speak in the mildest terms, highly improper. Would you know the sentiments of our fellow Citizens in these States, Publish all the Papers respecting that transaction. I have Copies of them at your service. You & I may safely foretell what will be the Issue. Superficial readers will say \""why this seems to be all fair enough.\"" Men of business & discernment will more greatly declare- JULY 8, 1779  \""This is a very extraordinary & a very dangerous mode of disposing of the Public Money.\"" I will add nothing harsh. You content your self Sir, with wishing that every person connected with Public business had such accounts as yours to produce. Where shall I find the ground whence you derive this self satisfaction? Not in your declaration in Congress the 11th September 1778, respecting the Books of the Commerical Committee which had been always under your special direction & in your private possession about nine Months antecedent to that date.3 Not from the unliquidated accounts of the Secret Committee which has been abolished near, or perhaps upwards of two Years. Not from the condition in which you returned the Books of both, to the late or present Commercial Committee in almost inextricable confusion; many more Months have since rolled over & I cannot learn that those Books are, even at this moment, in a state to be boasted of. Not from your confession that the proof introduced by the Gentleman whom you very unjustly call an Accuser, had Escaped your self & the Committee. This proof should have been produced as the very Corner Stone of your justification & of their Report; it was the only paper that could have averted general Censure; without it, the Report of the Committee & all you could have said would not have satisfied our Constituents. The opinions of Congress would have been recorded in such terms as would have given you lasting pain. The discovery of that Paper altho' it was not particularly incumbent on me to seek for it afforded me that satisfaction which a Man feels who knows, that to be honest & impartial towards every Man are duties due to himself. Permit me Sir before I conclude to say-If you rank me among your Enemies, you do me great injustice, I acknow. that I have not approved of your general conduct in public business, it has in every instance within my knowledge been ambiguous-always wanting your own explication. I dislike the train in which the Commercial Committee's Books are at present-you would not do amiss were you again to submit the adjustment of them to any other hand & in any other House than your own, you once returned them after more Months effort, because they were \""confused\"" although they had been the work of your own performance and direction.

7491,dg013185,1779,Henry Laurens to Jonathan Trumbull Sr,""" Henry Laurens to Jonathan Trumbull, Sr.   Governor Trumbull, 8th July [ 1779] I feel myself highly honored by Your Excellency's Letter of the 22d Ulto and much indebted for the indulgence you are pleas'd to grant me.(1) I will endeavour to make better returns hereafter, but six hours in Congress together with Morning and Evening Committees will plead some excuse for deliquency, which in general may be termed unavoidable. Were you here Sir, or did you know all, that some of your friends here know, you would be less pleased with the aspect of Public affairs than you think you are. The derangement which alarms you is the fruit of seed sown long ago-a want of harmony within, and of virtue and fortitude without Doors, are the obstacles which render it seemingly impracticable to eradicate the evil. I do not mean to arrogate to those within doors all the virtue and fortitude in the World, had they but a competent JULY 8, 1779  portion, there would be more harmony among them-in a word my dear and venerable Sir, I look up to Heaven for relief, and am almost arrived at the point of exclaiming, vain is the help of Man! assured at the same time that Man will be made the instrument for working our deliverance. An Answer which I lately writ to an Address from a plaintive friend in a neighbouring State may perhaps satisfy Your Excellencys inquiries respecting our Currency and foreign connections &c, therefore I shall take the liberty of inclosing with this, a Copy and of refering Your Excellency to the contents. The time is not yet arrived for congratulations on success in South Carolina, on the contrary, the circumstances of that forlorn State are to be deplored. The Printed Paper of the 29th May which will accompany this Letter, contains a succinct account of the Enemys proceedings from his crossing Savannah to that time-what happened since to the 10th June, is not important, a few skirmishes which have ended in our favor. The impetuous Pulaski by indiscreet attack, which I believe is only hinted in the Newspaper, lost 60 or 70 of the little Corps of Men carried with him from hence. It is said the Civil Council in Charlestown had voted five to three for surrendering on terms the Country to the Invaders, and I have seen two Letters which intimate that Count Pulaski and Colonel Laurens by great exertions prevented the intended effect. Why the name of Genl. Moultrie is left out, I cannot say, but I am quite sure the Measure met his utmost opposition, and I am highly pleased at finding that the People were equally opposed to it. I am informed by a very sensible friend under the 9th of June that there will be severe inquiry into the Conduct of those Councellors when the House of Assembly meets. But let us not censure the Council unheard, tis evident the terms were not acceptable to the British Generals. The British Army consists of not more than four thousand Men, these occupy Johns Island and a part of the Main Land, having Stono River running between the Islands and their intrenchment on the Main. The Navigation to their Shipping, about 30 in number including four men of War, lies open to them. They may embark when they please, but I am of opinion they will wait for some reinforcement, attempt to reoccupy James Island which lies within three quarters of a Mile on the South face of Charlestown and from thence conduct a Bombardment while they make another attempt on the Works which have hitherto secured the City between Cooper and Ashley Rivers. The prospect I assure you Sir, is truly affecting. General Lincoln had not more than three thousand Men with him, about the same number were in Garrison, of these one half at least are undisciplined Militia fettered with families, and fatigued by service in an extreme hot Country. Colonel Root had been taught to laugh at, and oppose me when I   represented to Congress some Months ago my apprehensions of the distresses which have fallen on that devoted Country. Connecticut Delegates should select proper Lodgings, but this between you and me Sir, as I mean to give no offence. The Enemy are under disadvantages also, the Sun shines as hotly on an Englishman as on a Carolinian, heavy rains will hurt the former most-they have already a copious Hospital and desertion from their Army is rife. Here we will leave the subject praying the disposer of all human events to interfere in our favor. When I hear further from that Country Your Excellency shall be immediately informed. I have the honor to be, With the greatest Respect & Esteem, Sir Your obligd. & Obedt. Servt. HL ""

The Enemy did not lie when they said the Council offered to surrender, the Vote was carried 5 against 3. But this ought not to be blazed; as many Circumstances alleviate the Conduct.(1) These you will shortly know. It is certain however that the People in general there resent the Conduct; and the Assembly will on meeting make severe Scrutiny.

We had a Letter from Genl. Lincoln dated the 4th of June, which came to hand yesterday, giving a particular account of the progress of the Enemy since they entered South Carolina, and their present Situation.

They are Encamped not far from Charlestown near Johns Island and our army under Gen. Lincoln within about 3 miles of them, the city of Charlestown is Strongly fortified on the Land side which is a narrow pass between two large Rivers. You will Soon have a more full account in the Newspapers.

7501,dg013195,1779,Gouverneur Morris to Benjamin Towne,"""Gouverneur Morris to Benjamin Towne   Mr. Printer, July 9? 1779] (1) In one of the publications under the signature of Common Sense is this very trite and common though just observation, \""an anonymous detractor is the serpent of society;\"" how much more he that detract merits, who boldly obtrudes his person upon the public view, it is his to determine. The palm of matchless impudence shall be his, and he may boast unrivalled the contempt of shame. Any man who reads the story of a worthy citizen whose ease, health, and pleasure having been sacrificed in the public service, is prosecuted and persecuted by beings who owe security to contemptibility, and importance to malevolence, will feel the emotions of honest indignation. His astonishment will be equal to his indignation that bold assertions, without evidence to support them, and dark insinuations devoid of probability, should for a moment turn the tide of popular opinion against the friends of mankind. Should we hear that some faithless Carthaginian had taken refuge in Rome from the justice which pursued his debts or his crimes; that having vainly opposed the measures taken for public liberty and safety, at once a sudden convert he had mouthed at Hannibal, and bellowed out for Fabius. That wormed into notice by a talent for abuse, he had been raised to a confidential office by a faction who laboured to undermine the great Fabius himself, the Saviour of his country. That to forward the views of his patrons, and promote the interests of his natal Carthaginian soil, he had betrayed the confidence reposed in him. That he had wantonly wounded the fairest character, branded the firmest patriots with the imputation of sinister views, and charged the generous and disinterested with an inordinate thirst for dishonest and disgraceful gain; that he had endeavoured to spread far and wide doubts and suspicions of the senate, to sap the confidence of the Romans, to weaken their councils and distract their views. That when chosen a tribune of the people, he had laboured to keep even bread itself from the army, under pretence of a public scarcity, and thus to leave the country a prey to her foes; and that notwithstanding all this the Romans should listen to, and confide in this man, this faithless Carthaginian. Should we, I say, hear these things, what should we think of the Romans? Change but the name, my countrymen, and the story is told about you. The Romans were an honest unsuspecting people, and so are the Americans? Who was an Englishman?  JULY 9, 1779  Tom P____ .(2) Who was a Tory? Tom P____ . Who wrote the Crisis, and abused Howe? Tom P____ . Who was made secretary to the committee of foreign affairs? Tom P____ . Who recommended him to that office? . Who betrayed state affairs? Tom P____ . For whom did he betray them? . Who has traduced the tried friends of America? Tom P____ . Who has endeavored to raise suspicions against congress? Tom P____ . Who was made a committee man? Tom P____ . Who proposed a resolution to the committee to prevent supplies from going to the army? Tom____ . Who maintains Tom P____ ? Nobody knows. Who is paid by the enemy? Nobody knows. Who best dese[rv]es it? Tom P____. I have long been a spectator of the calumnies thrown out against some of the best and fairest characters on this continent, and beheld their silence with astonishment. I could attribute it to nothing but the consciousness of innocence, or the timidity of guilt; prone to think charitably on the one hand, but deeply alarmed on the other, I waited the evidence which could justify such assertions. It did not appear; but instead of it new and accumulated charges were made, and they were received with the same contemptuous or callous insensibility. I set myself to inquire into the private characters of the gentlemen traduced, and I found them to be directly contrary to the allegations made. Upon publishing the journals of congress, I find that such of them as are members of that body, have preserved a conduct totally different from that which had been attributed to them. I again examined the various publications, to discover, if possible, some foundation on which these high wrought charges could be supported. My search was in vain, unless indeed I was disposed to take assertion for proof. I then drew a comparison between those who made the assertions, and those against whom they were made; and if property, probity and honor, with an unshaken perseverance in our righteous cause, through the most gloomy prospects and distressful circumstances, if these things are of any weight, the balance is clearly in favor of the accused. If these things can be admitted, as pledges to our country for the fidelity, the attachment and the zeal of her citizens, if these can form a shield against the shafts of detraction, those shafts must fall blunted to the earth.(3) Being therefore fully convinced of their integrity and innocence, and being convinced that not only from justice but also from interest the public ought to cherish those servants, whose talents have been eminently useful, I cannot do better than unravel from time to time motives and views, the knowledge of which will enable the world to read writers as well as writings. I shall not attempt to defend any man or measure that does not deserve to be defended, and if in the course of what I shall say, those are dragged out who now lie behind the curtain, they must thank themselves for it. Let the dogs be silent, or the huntsman shall appear.  In Hall and Seller's Gazette of the thirtieth of June, there are two papers, the one signed Common Sense, and the other Tiberius Gracchus, both of them levelled at a member of congress, supposed to be the author of a paper signed Americanus, both of them founded on a supposition that he had contended for excluding America from the fisheries. If this gentleman has meddled in the government affairs of Pennsylvania, let him answer for himself.(4) But he and every other our representatives in congress has a right to expect protection from the virtuous Whigs of America, while in the execution of his duty. I have reason to believe and authority to say, that the hon. mr. Morris was not the author of the piece signed Americanus, and neither saw it, heard it, or knew of it before the publication; that neither he, nor any other man now in congress ever held up an idea of ceding to Great Britain, or any power on earth, the right of fishing; and I call upon those gentlemen for the proof, if any they have, to contradict me, in order that the man or men, who shall have wantonly or wickedly misrepresented the debates of that honorable body, may be held up to the reproach they justly merit. The insinuation against that gentleman with respect to our finances is equally ill founded, and the minutes and the members of congress cannot but bear witness to his zeal for private justice, and to promote the public interests. Those who advanced their money to the United States in the hour of danger and distress, when to so much greater private advantage they might otherwise have employed it, are bound to a grateful acknowledgement of his exertions in their favor; and as far as America may derive credit from the reputation of honesty and fair dealing, so far will she feel an equal obligation. Alike unfair and far more despicable is the insinuation against another member of that honorable body. To whom is our country most indebted? Is it not to those who risqued most for her salvation? Those, who could suffer much and gain but little by the contest, exhibited real patriotism, but where is the merit of those, who safe in insignificance could loose nothing in the storm, and might even hope for a share of plunder in a general shipwreck,(5) who might be raised into importance by a turbulency of spirit, and satiate the lust of power by embarking on a troubled ocean? Is there a man among us whose consequence is derived from the calamities of his country, and though she should be plunged in inextricable debts to gratify private ambition, hath a certain exemption from the common calamity? Who can pay nothing, because he has nothing to pay? Timothy, art thou that man? If thou art, then be thou the advocate for war! For inexpiable war! But can you, my countrymen, who feel the weight of it, whose toil, whose riches, and whose blood, must be expended to support it. Can you wish to prolong its distresses, to renew the cries of the orphan and the widow, to increase the number of those who groan in captivity, to add weight to their chains, and aggravate the afflictions of the afflicted.(6)  From the moment that the question of the fisheries became a public topic, my curiosity has been excited to examine it. Great authorities appear on either side. One party contending that a nation may lawfully hold them exclusively; the other, that all nations have an equal and common right. Different nations have patronized the different doctrines. England hath maintained the former, and Holland the latter, for more than a century. Much ink and much blood have been spilt upon the occasion; but after all it remains, as such things usually do, quite undecided; and the arguments of either party are made use of as best suits the interests and conveniency of states. I am firmly persuaded that the God of nature intended the large fisheries, now alluded to, as a common benefit to all his creatures; and in this persuasion, I do not hesitate to affirm that it would be a species of treason ever to give up, in the most distressful situation of our affairs, a right so important to America. And if after a peace Great Britain should disturb us in the exercise of that right, I conceive such disturbances to be among those lawful causes of war which would justify us in a declaration of it, and in calling upon our allies to assist us. It is absurd to suppose that Great Britain would insist on our renouncing this our claim of right. It would be both impolitic and unjust. It would be the downright Popery of politics, which not content with the free enjoyment of its own opinions, would force an assent to them from the rest of mankind. But would it be wise in us, after Great Britain, shall agree to acknowledge our independence, which on our own principles necessarily involves the common right of fishing; would it, I say, be wise or politic to refuse the offer, and to carry on still farther this destructive war purely to compel the king of Great Britain to renounce the heresies contained in the works of Selden and other such writers, and avowed, declared, and maintained in divers public acts of the said king and of his predecessors, to force from him a confession that the doctrine of exclusive right to seas, banks and fisheries, is erroneous, impious, and absurd; to oblige him to retract all such aforegone declarations, and in the most clear, positive, and express terms acknowledge that America and all other nations have a common right to take fish in those places in the seas which he hath heretofore claimed as his own. Motives of interest and policy would undoubtedly prevent Great Britain from commencing hostilities by plundering our fishermen; but motives of pride, and what she calls national honor, would equally prevent her from making the desired acknowledgment. As to the calling on our allies to prosecute the war with us for this end, I cannot think it so clear as some gentlemen seem to do, that they would incline to it. We should think it very ridiculous if the most Christian king should require us to carry on the war until his brother of England should renounce the title of king of France. Perhaps it would not appear much more wise to the French ministry,  should we require them to carry on the war until he shall renounce the claim to be king of the fishing banks. If there be on earth an undoubted indisputable right of individuals or of nations, certainly it is the right of private opinion; and so long as opinions are not accompanied with injurious acts, it is at best but an absurdity to contest them. Here then stands the question. Is it just or prudent to continue the present war, in order to compel Great Britain to acknowledge that we have as good a right to the fisheries as she has? Is it probable that other nations will stand by and see these thirteen great and powerful states maul and pummel the two little weak and insignificant islands of Great Britain and Ireland, until she makes such acknowledgment; an acknowledgment which, consisting of mere words, would neither validate our claim, nor secure us in the peaceable exercise of our right? Certainly it becomes those either in doors or out, who maintain this doctrine, to provide solid arguments and powerful fleets.(7) Until this be done, neither Common Sense, nor Uncommon Sense, Tiberius Gracchus, nor Tiberius Nero, shall ever persuade me to be of their party. Nor do I believe that invective, abuse, or any other the embellishments which adorn their oratory, can persuade the citizens of these United States to desert those whose firm councils have gained applause abroad, and merited confidence at home, while they prudently labour to fix the great object of American independence, and establish that peace, liberty, and safety, which are the objects of the present contest. And however it may suit the factious views of some men to continue the war, or whatever hopes they may entertain who expect to ingratiate themselves with the common enemy, by sowing dissentions among us, and diminishing the respect which is due to congress, you, my dear countrymen, are too wise and too honest not to discern your friends from your foes. Examine for yourselves, determine for yourselves, and let those feel your resentment who deserve it. CATO. Reprinted from the Pennsylvania Evening Post, July 9, 1779. ""

For these purposes the following Resolutions are Submitted to the Consideration of Congress. JULY 10, 1779  Resolved that the Committee upon the Memorial of Mr. John Codman junr. agent for Captain Joas Garcia Duarte, prepare Bills of Exchange to be signed by the President upon the Ministers Plenipotentiary of the United States of North America, at the Coart of Versailles, for the Sum of Sterling & payable at eighteen Months Sight & bearing an interest of Six per Cent per Annum.

I am much oblidged to you for the Letter I Reced some time since with the information relating to the appointment of of My Son Peter.(2) He left the Town the next morning but did not acquaint me whether he would accept the Office or not, but by a Letter I Receivd from him by last Post he mentioned Coll Frelinghuysen having sent for him to Hackinsack, to Receive orders, which matter he did not explain, as the Papers say Coll. Nelson was the Commanding Officer, so that I do not understand the Arrangement at all. New Jersey has this day 4 Delegates in the House but I much doubt there being so many againe in a hurry. Dr. Wetherspoon says the Governor has lately had a lucky escape from 12 Arm'd Horsemen Tories who came to take him. I wish he would live in a Town as I think he would be much safer then in a Country Place. I realy wonder that you venture to live in Monmouth as I have always thought that County, was as bad as Bergen. For my Part I dare not goe home, while the Enemy continue in that neighborhood, indeed I imagine I have very little left to goe too, as I have heard since Mrs. Fell went from hear, that during her absence, her only Wench, which makes the fifth Negroe had gon to the Enemy and has besides Robd the house, (She must be greatly distressd indeed). It is now Past (3) oClock, and not like to break up soon, however as I have not one word of News that can be deppend on or worth writing, I JULY 10, 1779  shall only tell you, that if you will favour me with a line when you have an Opportunity I shall take it exceeding kind. I forgot one thing, there is a Vesell arriv'd this day from St. Eustatia by whom Our Commercial Committee, have a Letter of June 16th from Our Agent3 who says, Adm Byron, was gon to see a large fleet clear of the Islands, and that Count Estang was yet at Martinique, that Byron's Ships was said to be very ill Mann'd, have lost a very great number both Sailors and Soldiers, that DeEstaing had not so many large Ships as Byron, that they both expected reinforcements but none had arriv'd. The Captain Reports that the french have taken St. Vincent, I do not beleave one word of it, as if true our Letter from Mr Governeour would certainly have mentiond it.

The full confidence we repose in your Majesty's constant attention to the great objects of the treaties subsisting between us, and our earnest desire vigorously to Co-operate in the attainment of them induced us to submit the following facts and proposals to your consideration. At the commencement of the present War we were in a great degree destitute of Arms, Ammunition and cloathing for our Armies, and supplies have since been irregular, fortuitous and scanty. Our husbandmen have been so much interrupted by frequent calls to Arms, that even the productions of our fertile country have been considerably diminished and other Natural effects of war have rendered our usual commodities for exportation less abundant than formerly. Our coasts have long been and still are so infested by the enemy's cruizers, that our commerce has been greatly injured, and both exports and imports become very hazardous. For want of naval stores our marine exertions have been less extensive than they otherwise would have been, and while commodities proper for remittances remain scarce, and the transportation of them precarious we have little reason to expect ample supplies from private contracts and commercial projects. We are impressed with the strongest conviction of your Majesty's friendly disposition towards us and are persuaded that the same magnanimity, which induced your Majesty to Unite with us in frustrating the cruel designs of a nation whose power and lust of dominion had become dangerous to their Neighbours and Oppressive to us, will continue to influence your majesty to exertions glorious to France and advantageous to your Allies. We therefore take the liberty of requesting your majesty to furnish us with these necessary supplies, an estimate of which we have ordered our minister to lay before you,(2) and we pledge the faith of these States for the repayment, with interest of whatever sums may be advanced for that purpose as soon as the restoration of peace shall have enabled us. Be assured that they shall be vigorously used against the common enemy, with whom we shall neither conclude peace nor truce without Your concurrence, and that it is our sincere desire that the Alliance between us may be as beneficial to France as it has been liberal and salutary to these United States. Done at Philadelphia the tenth day of July 1779 by the Congress of the United States of America your faithful friends and Allies. John Jay. President JULY 10, 1779  ""

7509,dg013203,1779,Henry Laurens to William Livingston,"""Henry Laurens to William Livingston   Dear Sir 10 July 1779. I had the honor of addressing your Excellency under the 5th Inst intended by Dr Scudder who still remains in Town but will leave us tomorrow and now tells me he does not make Trenton in his way. Yesterday I received your Excellency's favor of the 10th Ult. (1) by the hands of Mr Houston, (2) I thank you Sir for introducing me to the acquaintance of a Gentleman of his Character. We have at length heard from Charles Town the bulk of intelligence appears in Bradfords and Dunlaps paper extracted from a paper which I sent them. The Enemy were intrenched on each side of Stono River, part on Johns Island, the remainder on the Main-the communications easy-their Hospital on the Island and very full-their shipping about 30 Sail including four men of War within Edisto and Stono Inlets, with these they have free communication and may withdraw when they please but as they had just received a schooner laden with Mortars and Ordnance it seemed as if they meant to repossess themselves of James Island (which lies within 3/4 of a mile of Charleston) and from thence attempt to destroy the remains of a pretty Town which their incendiary emissaries had in divers essays above half burned by Fire. If your Excellency should hear that some of the Council of South Carolina had voted for surrendering the Capital to the Enemy on certain terms, let it be remembered that the terms  JULY 10, 1779  proposed were not acceptable to Gen Prevost and that they might have been calculated for gaining a day or two in order to complete the fortification and to receive militia reinforcements. Be this as it may there was a Young man an Aid de Camp of our great commander in Chief who when solicited refused at all hazards \""to go out with a flag on any such errand\"" that whatever were the motives or the propositions of the Council the project as soon as it was known was reprobated by the People and that the voice for a severe scrutiny was loud. Yet I will not censure the Council until they are heard in their own defence-certainly the neglect of that state will be pleaded in apology for the majority of Counsellors 5 to 3. The enemy announced their design to invade South Carolina nine months before they entered it and they were four months in its vicinage distant only the breadth of the river Savanna-upwards of six months had Congress been recommending to the states of Virginia and North Carolina to send succors-What succors did those states send? In my last I suggested to your Excellency the seeming necessity for a Grand Council-to day we have received another gleam of light (perhaps glimpse may be a better word; we will adjust the term according to events-but I do not give up the idea of a Grand Council and I have not the smallest doubt of receiving your Excellency's approbation of the measure when we come to talk the matter over-when will that be? Could I ride on horseback as well as I could twenty years ago it should be on this day sen-night-but I have eat my cake and must be contented. Were I a citizen of a large extended country whose present and future happiness depended upon the yeas or nays of a Council of 20 or 30 I should hold it essential to that happiness to have the wisdom, the experience, the vigilance, the diligence, the virtue of the whole Country concentred in that 20 or 30 and I would admit no birds of passage. Are not long and frequent vacations great impediments to School-boys? Days before they go, all the days they are absent and some days after their return are so many days lost-& what good can be expected from new Scholars. If we get safe on shore we shall look back with equal pleasure and amazement. I have written very freely because your Excellency has encouraged me to do so and because I know to whom I write. I should not much care if every thing I write were published by Rivington, but I hate to have flies buzzing about me, tho' they are easily brushed off. I pray God to bless your Excellency & I request you Sir to believe that I am with sincere regard & attachment &c. H. L. ""

We (4) shall give a private Audience (5) on Monday in Consequence of Dispatches recd. last Monday by yr. Neighbour Brewer. They were of old Date. The King is pleased that we have only one Minister at the french Court. We are to know this by finding how much that one has the Confidence of the Court. \""As to others what was said it is better for the House to hear.\"" Ergo an Audience ensues. It will be upon a level Line of Importance with the former parvum in multo; We are enjoyned Secresy before hand; tho Gomez was telling the Story at the Coffee House last Eveng.(6) By the Way, on this Topic of Secresy Smith Says he must tell all his State calls for; and Burke says if certain Ultimata do pass he will immediately let his State know them. Why should not I say if they do not pass I will also tell my State? These same News-Paper Gentry say, in the House, that though Adams & Lee are gone, yet the Supporters of their Measures are left here, wherefore a minority governs. I recon that one Session after the Audience will finish foreign Affairs so far as relates to Ultimata. The Arrangement of the Treasury will also be finished at the next Tryal; and That, I suppose, will be called finishing the Finance Reports. I forgot to remark above that if Doctr. Franklin has the Confidence of the French Court it is strange that we have not a Line from him by their Packet. He was, indeed, always very backward of writing to the State which employed him, though he was lengthy to Individuals. I verily believe that they folgerize (7) us in France often. I expect that Arthur is to be squinted at if nothing worse in the Audience. For, though the Family of Lee is now linked in public, yet one in Office is too much for the inveterate Party to yeild to. There is great Success against the Indians on the Western Frontiers by Partizan Warriors, but I fear all the Expence will be thrown away upon an excellently well conducted Retreat in the grand Attempt. The Money is to be sent on to the Loan Office by the return Waggons which brought the Condemned Emissions;(8)but, I hope a wise & generous Spirit will show itself among your monied Men to take Loan Certificates instead of Bills for what they now have a  JULY 10, 1779  Demand for upon the Loan Officer. There seems in this Quarter, a Desire to enable us to stop the Press. Pray encourage such a Disposition in your Neighbourhood.

7512,dg013206,1779,John Armstrong Sr to Horatio Gates,"""John Armstrong, Sr., to Horatio Gates   Dear General Philada. 12th July 1779. In Congress our great publick points tho often agitated, are but little, very little removed from the ground on which they stood when I wrote you last,(1) notwithstanding that two months have elapsed since in answer to that letter, I had yr. favour of the 27th of April, for which (if not tendered before) I beg you will even at this late day accept my Cordial thanks. Congress have lately thrown out a Small Scheme of Finance, with a view to borrow money, Stop the Press & prevent the farther depreciation of that already in circulation; whether it will have the desired effect is yet uncertain, and at present very doubtful, as in this City (a kind of mirror or first mover to the adjacent States) many I find are of Opinion they can employ their money to better purpose than in our Sinking funds, so that it's very probable we must early hold up higher inducements to money holders in order to procure such loans as when joined to that to be derived from taxation may Serve as a constant Supply & prevent the necessity of farther Emissions. The Enemy we hear have landed a body of their Troops at New Haven, if so, tis to play the game of Norfolk over again, harras, pillage & destroy. Before this time you will have learned that our long and fallacious amusement of a favourable event on the 11th of May at Charlestown was vain, no such action having happened-and now General Lincolns dispatches being come the Substance amounts to little more than that Charlestown appears to be Safe for the present, the Enemy being encamped And fortified on Stono River Some twelve or Sixteen miles Southward of the Town where they derive Some Supplys from Johns Island, and from whence they can embark with little molestation when they think proper. Their numbers the Genl. esti- JULY 12, 1779  mates at three thousand five hundred as I best remember. He(Genl. Lincoln) is Encamped at Some convenient distance with a Superior force, but probably considers the Enemy inaccessible at least to his troops in their present possition. It appears unfortunate that when Genl. Provost directed his march for Charlestown, Genl. Lincoln was then on the South Side of the Savana River & considerably back in the Country so that he cou'd not reach the Rear of Provosts Army untill he had arived near Charlestown, Sent in a Flag demanding a Surrender and had time to retreat to the ground he now occupies. There is reason to believe that the Executive Council of that State or at least Some of them were disposed to come to terms with the Enemy but upon hearing that their Soldiery must be prisoners of war Genl. Moultry (for I think the Governor Mr. Rutledge was not in Town) bravely rejected the Overture. These people are miffed because they had not a Detatchment from Genl Washingtons Army Sent to them, a great mistake-true North Carolina has not done what might well be presumed they ought to have done, Still it is grievous to think that Charlestown fortified as it is, knowing that Lincoln was also in their rear shou'd for a moment hesitate to resist that inferior Army. General Sullivan is at Wioming waiting for more Provisions or other preparations. He is a favourite of your neighbour Mr. Ellery, and we all wish him well, but if he have Success he will have double Credit, as little but expence is yet expected-true it was necessary that Some troops shou'd appear in that Country in order to prevent the ravages that otherwise wou'd have been Committed in the States of New York & Pennsylvania. We have lately arrived here an agreeable & intelligent Young Gentleman (Doctor Shields) from Dublin who left that City in the begining of March last, who assures us we have many wellwishers in that country-That the Kings Speeches so far as they respect the American War & prayers for the Arms of the nation here, are treated with high contempt by many of the first Characters-That the Lord Lieut. is obliged to wink at several matters otherwise disagreeable to his Court-and that when he left Ireland no considerable number of troops were even talked of or in the least expected to be Sent to America this Year, except a few to the Islands and that shou'd a Reinforcement of importance be thought of he is certain it must be late in the Season. Some Men on 'tother Side the Water begin to conjecture that 'tis only the Obstinacy & pride of the British King that now prevents the concession of Our Independance, and that when soever that event shall take place, the thing in Substance must be aimed at, without insisting on the ungrateful words Independance Sc. Not one line from any of our Commissioners abroad, a mystery which I cannot unfold, nor do I believe so long Silence to be possible, however necessary that their letters containing probably but little,  shou'd be confined to few hands. As you know the Ocean bears no Vessel more leaky than Congress. Mr. Marchant & my Self have exerted our Selves for your friend Captain Banks-we are indeed oppressed with men in his Situation, and the liberallity of the publick almost worn out, he however has been pritty fortunate at least in dispatch whereof I believe he is Sensible; the Resolution does not Oblige you to make him Town Major, being only meant conditionally & until he can return to Europe or otherwise dispose of his time.(2) I am happy in observing Your Correspondance with the Commander in Chief which is indispensible to the Service, and hope you will indulge me the pleasure of a devoute wish that it be maintain'd in perfect lattitude. I am dear General, with great truth, Affectionately Yours. John Armstrong [P.S.] From the Packet to which you allude nothing of consequence transpired, I think I have heard it called duplicates. We have not yet fully decided on the Fishery, a dish which I hope will always be well relished in America. ""

The News-papers which accompany this will tell you in what JULY 12, 1779  manner I spent the two days succeeding your departure; since that I have gone in the old Jogg-trot, attending Congress every day. On Saturday last I dined with Mr. President Jay, who had a chosen company, viz. the Minister of France, Don Juan de Miralles, the President, Vice-President & Secretary of the State, Mr. Brackenridge, Doctor Sheals (lately from Ireland), General Lincoln's Aid de camp Major Price &c.(1) For the public News I shall refer you to the papers; excepting this, we have good rzews from abroad. I can communicate no more. I have advertised all my real estate for sale, except my Possessions at Newcastle &c. In this Act I have two things in view, the first, to serve my country, by shewing I have a greater regard for the Continental paper currency than for land, which at this critical period will have an effect upon it, as I know it will occasion speculation; at least I shall thereby be enabled to serve the General cause by lending the United States some money if I sell: the second view is to sell to advantage and to have it in my power to purchase some valuable plantation, whereon I may live cheap, and spend the remainder of my days in comfort in some healthy & good part of the country, and I shall not be scrupulous about buying the estate of a Traitor, which is confiscated; or if I shall find it more beneficial employ my money in trade, at least for a season. The family is well, except Nancy, whose boils have been very troublesome, especially one on her throat just under the chin: she is however dosing with cream of tartar & flour of sulphur mixed with molasses, and is getting better. Your difficulties at Schuylkill ferry with the new horse I have heard, but nothing more concerning you since you left home. I suppose the harvest prevents travelling, or I cannot find out at what Inns the people from Newcastle &c. put up. Pray, enquire particularly of John Clark Esquire Sheriff, John Thompson Esq. or Mr. William McClay, whether either or which of them has the deeds & papers for Mr. Montgomery's lands &c. at the Bridge, now belonging to Mr. & Mrs. Willday and Robert Montgomery, and let me know, who has them. If you can get them, send them to me by the first good hand. The children give their duty to you, and their love to their sister Sally. I must beg you'll present my affectionate regard to Mr. & Mrs. Vn Laivenigh, Mr. & Mrs. Thompson, my brother & his wife, Mr. & Mrs. Finney and to Mr. & Mrs. Dunn, and to all & singular my friends who inquire for me.

Dr. Witherspoon & Mr. Atlee, these were to be joined by two Gentn from Connecticut but the Dr. was in so great a hurey that he and Atlee set off the day before the others arrived, whether a report will be received from these two, is not yet determined.(3) I am happy to find the Court have determined to lay in their Claim to that Territory but I could wish nothing had been said in the vote, of Vermont being an Independent State. It gives me great pleasure that the people are sensible of the necessaty of Taxing, certainly no other mode can effectually retrieve the credit of the Currency, that, with some other measures I trust will do it. Regulating prices by the several Town may answer a good temporary purpose, till other measures have time to operate. The exertions of New Hampshire for raising men &c have ever been at least equal to any state in the Union this has always afforded me particular satisfaction. I cannot however help expressing a wish that the measures now adopted had engaged the attention of the Court at an earlier period. The accots. from S. Carolina fall infinitely short of the reports that first reached this place & from hence was circulated with great embellishments but I still flatter myself we shall have a good accot of the Ravagers in that Country, I must refer you to the Newspapers for the situation of affairs there.

I heartily wish the good news from Carolina was confirmed in its full extent, but you'll find by the newspapers that the true account falls infinitely short. When I mentioned the reports in my letters, I think I did with caution; for though the reports came many ways, not having authentic accounts prevented my placing so much confidence in the reports as many did-however our affairs in that country by no means wear an unfavorable aspect. I have not so unfavorable an opinion of the regulations of the several towns as you seem to have. I am inclined to think they may answer a good temporary purpose at this critical juncture till measures have time to operate. Several ships are arrived in Chesapeake Bay from France-they sailed with a fleet of 70 sail transport, convoyed by 5 ships of the line and several frigates bound to the West Indies, having on board from 10 to 13000 troops. Will not this reinforcement enable the Count to look Byron in the face. If our ally could gain one capital advantage by sea it would give a glorious turn to our affairs-but we ought not, and I hope do not depend on any thing but our own exertions and Heaven's smiles-these would soon accomplish our utmost wishes, if Avarice, that bane to true felicity was banished from the Human Breast-but this is a work beyond the reach of mortals, therefore needless for you and I to attempt it, any farther than respects ourselves-so far Heaven has given us the power which I hope we shall improve for the good of Society.

It is a matter of surprize and regret that Congress have not recd. a letter from their plenipotentiary, or either of their commissioners in Europe, for more than six months past; in which time the minister of France has recd. several dispatches from his court, and one very lately, the contents of which he has (in part) communicated to congress.(2) I hope I shall not be suspected of affecting a mysteriousness when I tell you I am not at liberty to mention particularly the minister's communications, nor would it be prudent to risque them in a letter, under the present regulation of our post office: however, this much I can venture to say, that they are favourable-that the prospect of peace brightens, and that France seems to act on a very liberal scale, & has, in many instances, gone further in support of the common cause than she was, by the treaty, bound to go; notwithstanding which, it is to be feared, we are not all true friends to the alliance. Nothing of consequence lately from headquarters. The enemy, on the night of the 4th instant, made a sudden descent, with about 3000 men, at New Haven in Connecticut, and took possession of the town, but what damage they did we have not yet learnt. We have letters from genl. Sullivan dated at Wyoming the 5th instant; he complains of large quantities of damaged provisions, by which the progress of his army is much retarded. I have but little hopes from that expedition. Our cruisers in general are pretty successful, & I hope before this reaches you the enemy's privateers in Chesapeake bay will have met with a rub.  JULY 13, 1779  I am apprehensive we shall shortly be overun by committees.(3) The original ostensible design of them was laudable, and under proper regulations might, perhaps, produce good effects; tho' I confess little or nothing salutary has yet been experienced by them here; and I am of opinion they are taking large strides towards the entire subversion of this government, the civil magistrates being, already, little more than mere cyphers.

It appears to me that Virginia will do her part in placing things upon an adequate foundation; a large Income of Money, and a most judicious taxation. Members of Congress highly applaud your wisdom in demanding Indian Corn, Wheat, Tobacco &c. I wish to heaven such measures had been adopted many months ago by every State in the union. I have no doubt the Enemy are waiting thus long to see the downfall of our paper Credit, but even that calamitous affair would do them no essential Service; America can never be reunited to Britain; and finances with our brave and determined people are only a secondary consideration. The proceedings of Council relative to G. Hamilton &c.(1) were received by Congress with the utmost applause; the whole matter is beautifully stated; the sentence judicious and spirited. That peace is a most desirable object no man in his senses ought to deny, but then it must be a peace honorable to America and grateful to our allies. I hope such a one will take place before Christmas next. By the violence of a giddy Multitude it would be highly disagreeable to patch up even an Independant peace at the expence of public faith and future salvation. Why are committees upon the establishment throughout all America? They have almost murdered the French Agent at Wilmington. Indeed Fisheries are too much of external nature to be fought for at present; yet in a treaty of peace I would not relinquish them; they should stand upon the common right of Independant nations. But unhappily this will not answer the purpose. The bleeding Continent must bleed still further. When I say my expectations lead to peace I do not JULY 13, 1779  mean that England will expressly acknowlege our Independance; the pride of George will not submit; but she may treat with us as an Independant people notwithstanding provided our demands are not unreasonable, which the French Court are in apprehension about, and therefore trust that moderation and a well-guaranteed peace ought not to be despised in our low circumstances. The Enemy with a body of five thousand men have plundered and destroyed Newhaven NB in Connecticut; they carried off the wife and children of old Shearman the member of Congress; yesterday he left this City full of anxiety and trouble; I pity the Lady and Children exceedingly, but I have no tender feelings for the old fellow on many accounts. & am Sir, Yours most affly., A.

You know that we united in Opinion that it was trifling for such an Assembly as Congress to stipulate conditionally in regard to peace, as the sine qua non would be calf-carried (1) immediately out of the House, and no other Instructions would stand a Chance to be prevalent. I am more than ever convinced of such Consequences to be apprehended. Our (2) Treaty of Alliance being published to please Chase & some others has had this pretty Effect viz. England seing the VIII Article, & knowing both France & Spain disposed to Peace, & finding the latter obliged only to wait for an alternative Assurance of our Independence, will never be explicit, while a tacit Conduct of the great Point can be made to suffice.(3) Your Experience of the Disposition of Persons & Things here will lead you to conclude readily that much Time will be wasted on a Decision ill becoming our former Spirit be made. The Western Parade (4) has nearly broken the back of our grand army. D'Estaing can not face Byron, 5th. Carolina is in a very poor Condition, can you then look for Spirit where you know it was not six months ago? The Court of France is greatly pleased with our having but one minister there & that one Doctr. Franklin. We shall soon see that Confidence will \""no longer be withheld.\""(5) Here is a Field open anew. Whereas the Information is only to do Justice to some past Practices for the Words are in a Comment of Mr. G____'s (6) upon the instruction given him to signify the Preference of one to three. The Comtee. are returned from Vermont. Witherspoon & Attlee did not wait for the arrival of the others so that it proves an Abortion as we empowered any three to act. It is true the others when they arrived did not find any Thing further to do than what was signified to them by Letter from these the doings of whom they approve by their Arrival. But it is too delicate an Affair to proceed in without going by critical Lines. The People expect to be heard regularly before any formal Decission is made concerning them. This will \""wound the Feelings\"" of some Gentlemen if not of a whole State if complied with; and it will mar all our past Endeavours not to comply with it.

7529,dg013223,1779,James Lovell to James Warren,"""James Lovell to James Warren   Dear Sir Confidential July 13th. 1779 Three days ago I wrote to Mr. Adams inclosing Papers that show the Spirit of the Parties in a certain little-great Assembly.(1) I must ingeniously acknowledge to you that if I had been properly convinced that Gr. Britain was seriously disposed for Peace, I should have rested on an Instruction to our Plenipotentiary \""in no case to give up a common right of Fishery.\"" But I have seen Reason to wish for a Stipulation that Britain shall not disturb us in the Exercise of that Right. If France can harbour no too-interested Views in regard to that grand Branch of Commerce, Britain surely would make every Advantage of our Inattention to it at the Hour of Peacemaking. And it has seemed to me as if some Persons here were much more bent upon coaxing than upon forcing a Peace from our Enemy. We are told that Passengers and Letters are put on shore in Nth. Carolina from a Vessel arrived in Cheseapeak which left Rochelle the 10th of May. We have not had a Line from our Appointments in France for a long Season. Mr. Gérard recd. Letters Via Boston, as mentioned in the Gazettes but they were not of very modern date. We had a Communication from him in a private Audience Yester- JULY 13, 1779  day but under the Injunctions of the House for Secresy, so that A & B will be stigmatized if they communicate the Substance in a private confidential Letter, should they be discovered, while C & D, under the Signature of Americanus or O Tempora O Mores; may publish the whole to the World in a News Paper. (2) I find that Gentlemen in your Neighbourhood are rather backward to accept a Delegation to Congress. The Reasons lay fair to Conjecture. Some cannot in Conscience & Honor hold several Appointments incompatible with each other; & Some cannot bring themselves to consent to sacrifice Time, Health & Estate for a Station of Abundant Anxiety and an equal Portion of Obloquy. I presume that all new elected Members ought to come forward before an old one though he has had a whole years Respite. One of your State would have had a terrible time here for several months back if he had been an acting Deligate.(3) He must have gone against the Interests of his Constituents or the Designs of his favorite old Associates.

Washington, informing that he had called Glovers Brigade from the State we have the Honor to represent, upon his hearing that an Embarkation had taken Place of Part of the Enemies Force at Newport.(1) This Intelligence was very alarming to Us especially as the Enemy are in considerable Force in the Sound, had attacked and entered Newhaven, from whence they might soon reach Newport Harbour & joind with the Forces there ravage Our State, and even the Massts. State, perhaps to their Capital, tho' they appear to be very inattentive to it. We moved that the Genls Letter might be committed to a special Committee; And that they take into immediate Consideration the present Situation of the State of Rhode Island &c.(2) This is done- But We feel Ourselves much at a Loss, since we cannot expect any Releif from Connecticut while their Whole Coast is liable to the Depredation of the Enemy-And since notwithstanding every Argument has been made use of by Our State & by Congress upon NewHamshire & Massts. Bay without scarce any Effect. And Altho' their very Salvation depends upon preserving the small Remains of Our State as a Barrier to Their Own. We wish for every Light upon this Subject, & for as good an Account as possible of the Numbers of the Enemy, Our Force, & what Addition We have any Prospects of raising ourselves, or procuring from Our Neighbours; As we would not be wanting in every Exertion for the Salvation of the State, and the Good of Our Neighbours however lost to it They may be, Or forgetful of their former deplorable Situation & the generous & noble Exertions of Our State in that Instant. We are well informed that five Ships of the Line, several Frigates & about seventy Transports sailed from France in May for Martinico. The Captn. of a Vessell arrived at Maryland, & who sailed with the above Fleet says there were between ten & Thirteen Thousand Troops on Board the said Transports.(3) We have also very agreable and interesting Intelligence from Europe, but entirely Political, and such as at present we may not communicate. We would say that nothing will prolong this War, or produce a very disadvantageous Peace; but the Want of publick Spirit, a Lost Sense of Our Own Interest, The Want of reviving the Credit of the Currency, which must be done by chearful Taxes & spirited Loans: By great Exertions of the particular States & the People within Them-And as much as any Thing by filling up the Battallions-Placeing a Formidable Army in the Field; and pushing with Vigour & Spirit whereever the Appearance of the Enemy shall make it necessary. Heaven has covered Our Fields with a Garment  JULY 14, 1779  of Plenty. Our Barns are fast crouding with the Substantials of Life; and while Health smiles around Us, let not Our Nerves be unstrung, Let Us not forget that We still have an Enemy, an implacable Enemy to contend with for the Continuance of all our Blessings-For Liberty, Peace and a glorious Independency.

The Minister of France informs Us, \""that the Exertions of these States are necessary to avert their Dangers, & prevent a prolongation of the present Contest-that his Master expects Efforts, that will on our part produce a vigorous & successful Campaign and bring the Common Enemy to a proper sense of the Disappointments he shall meet with.\"" By all the Advices We have receiv'd, it appears, that Great Britain is determined to make a most strenuous Attempt before the Campaign closes, for obtaining a decided superiority on this Continent, that for this purpose she sends out a large Reinforcement, and has rejected the Mediation offered by Spain. If she shall be able to carry this Design into Execution, it may be attended with very unhappy Consequences, as it will probably engage foreign powers to form Alliances for her support in this War. JULY 14, 1779  Prudence dictates in the plainest Manner, that We should be immediately & compleatly prepared not only to repel the violent Hostilities of an Enemy inflamed to Extremity by a Variety of passions, but to strike some Blow so important as to discourage any Combination in Europe for continuing the Calamities of this Contest after this Year. Congress therefore earnestly requests, that your State, imprest with the strongest Sense of the Emergency, may use the most instant & effective Means for filling up your Battalions, & putting your Militia in Order to march on the shortest Warning.

Almost in the same moment in which your favor by Genl. Thomson reached me, I was informed that your self & Mr. Bryan your Son were gone from New York under a flag for Georgia. This false intelligence restrained my pen & stopped the progress of a Letter from Mrs. Bryan which will now accompany this. I have cut the paper from the Seal, knowing the impropriety of attempting to send sealed packets to a prisoner of War without special permission, but I am totally ignorant of the contents, the signature only excepted. I have before me a Letter from Mr. Houston dated the 5th June Mrs. Bryan & your family were then well. Congress will not consent to exchange Citizens taken in the manner you were captured, all Solicitation on that head would be fruitless. If the Commander in Chief of His Britanic Majesty's forces at New York will permit you to return to Georgia on parole & your Son also,  JULY 14, 1779  I will pledge my honor that a suitable exchange shall be made or that both shall be forth coming whenever a demand shall be made; & when I reflect on the many instances of similar consideration which on our part have been extended to British Officers who have been in peculiar circumstances, I cannot help concluding that an appliction to Sir Henry Clinton will meet with success.(1) I am persuaded if Sir Henry knew of the many acts of kindness which as an individual I have shewn to British prisoners he would not hesitate a moment, even upon my request for your enlargement on the terms abovementioned. Your Letter of the 20th June intimates that you had sent others, for your Family & friends, none such came to my hands, you must either have omitted them, or they have been arrested in their passage. You Sir, who have been Schooled in the doctrine of Christian fortitude, will not suffer your Spirits to sink under a light weight, reflect that you are on Long Island, where you enjoy wholsome air & have a proper scope for exercise, the contracted sphere of a Ships hold occupied by an hundred inmates might, from an old Man, extort a groan. In your present situation be thankful, a little practice will make you chearful. My Compliments to your Son & beleive me to be with an affectionate regard, Dear Sir &ca. H. L. [P.

Philadelphia 14th July 1779 I had the honor of addressing you under the 29th Ulto. & since that, of receiving your favor of the 26th by Capt. Banck. (1) This Gen- JULY 14, 1779  tleman returns from Congress seemingly well pleased & I apprehend the Resolve in his favor will enable you to keep him so.(2) The Marquis de Britaigne will think himself the most unfortunate of all the zealous adventurers to America; when he arrived in Charles Town he found the incorporated french Volunteers under the Command of a Gentleman of their own choice, This Gentleman's honor will bend him to them until the temporary service expires & upon the arrival of that event the Corps will disband & every Man retire to his vocation. Our latest advices from So Carolina are dated the 10th June. You will have seen a detail of them in the News Papers of last Week, there is indeed a person at Edenton who avers that he left Charles Town on the 22d Ulto. & that the Troops under General Prevost were then prisoners of War-this is within the line of possibility & no more, therefore it makes no impression on me. Colo. Laurens complains, that he could not prevail on the Council by all his military reasoning to reinforce General Lincoln from the Garrison whence he judged a considerable body of good Men might with perfect safety have been detached, 'tis possible he might have succeeded in a subsequent application & it is probable that General Lincoln had received aid from those Men of the Militia who had upon General Prevosts first entring the Country fled to their several homes to take care of their families & effects, the number of these was considerable. I am sure if the people in that Country are in earnest they can bring into the field in three weeks 10000 good Men. All those in the southern district whose Negroes had been carried off, their Houses burnt & Plantations ruined will fight the stronger in order to revenge those Insults & injuries-upon the whole I will grant the Waif Man's account to be in part possible but I cannot admit that 3500 Troops under British Commanders & within three Miles of their Ships could have been all made prisoners. We have at this moment certain subjects on the tapis which demand all the wisdom virtue & fortitude of America, I wish I were with you & at liberty to converse freely for a single hour. I wish, even more earnestly, a Man of superior talents & abilities were in my green Chair. I am persuaded all will come right, but not until we shall have waded & plunged through a good deal of wrong & perhaps not until we shall be awakened by some rude stroke. Am I wrong Sir in this Idea, that in Young Republics, Citizen-Soldiers of high rank & great experience ought upon extraordinary occasions to be consulted? I in-treat you Sir do not communicate this to Rivington, he will put ten thousand false interpretations & glossings upon the best meaning. I had as lieve be tried by the Inquisition as by that fellow & certain of his adherents-in times like these, Men who feel, will speak; every Man who loves his Country & is acquainted with the present state of her affairs must feel & every such Man ought in decent terms to speak his honest feelings.  JULY 15, 1779  Let us look around, & inquire into the State of the Army, the Navy, the Treasury; the view is truly affecting, but what is most of all to be deplored is the torpitude of national virtue. How many Men are there who now in secret say, could I have believed it would have come to this, I would . I am not one of that number. I had my apprehensions, & signified them in Fludyer Street Westminster in October 1774.(3) To a friend in So Carolina, nevertheless, I said, I'll go & risque all. Capt.

7541,dg013235,1779,Francis Lewis to Robert R Livingston,"""Francis Lewis to Robert R. Livingston   Dear Sir, Phila 15th July 1779. I embrace this opportunity by Mr. Rosevelt to transmit you the several news papers lately published together with abstracts of the proceedings in Congress, which by their Resolves are hence forward to be published weekly, from these you will be enabled to collect most of the material occurrences transacted here. By a Vessell that lately arrived from Nantes Congress have received letters from their Commissioners at Paris,(1) informing that the British King is still positive, and obstinately bent upon carrying on the War with Vigor, this and perhaps another Campaign in America, but in their opinion his resources will be inadequate to the end. They also inform Congress that the expedition against New Haven was planned in the British Cabinet, but being novices to the Geography of the Country, the Troops were by that plan to proceed up Connecticut river to Wethersfield, after distroying that, proceed across the country and distroy Fairfield & New Haven, they were repulsed at the latter, but effected their diabolical plan at Fairfield, which you have ere this, undoubtedly heard the particulars off. From these their proceedings, it is evident that they purpose carrying on a predatory war against these States, therefore in my humble opinion it would not be advisable at present for Mrs. Livingston to prosecute her plan of building, as first intended. We have of late several arrivals both in this and the Chesapeake Bays, so that the prices of foreign Commoditys begin to lower. The resolutions of the various Committees has added to the cause, these  JULY 15, 1779  resolutions for regulating the prices will I believe become general, as the Town of Boston has unanimously come into similar resolutions, & transmitted them for the approbation of Congress, & I hope it may have the desired effect. The Army too has adopted the mode. Youl oblige me in communicating this with the perusal of the news-papers to the Governor, to whom please to present my Compliments, as also to your Lady & the family at Clear Mount, I am sincerly, Sir, your very Humble Servant, Fra. Lewis P. S. Permit me to observe, that the little state of New Jersey allow their Delegates twenty dollars each per diem, Virginia forty. The Massachusetts Bay allow a Table & all other expences. A New York Delegate cannot furnish a Dinner & Clean shirt, for his twelve dollars, at the present depreciated rates of our money, which you must be convinced off when last at this place. ""

7542,dg013236,1779,North Carolina Delegates to Richard Caswell,"""  North Carolina Delegates to Richard Caswell Sir Philadelphia July 15th. 1779 Immediately on receiving your favor of May 26th last, we laid before Congress the Several Matters wherewith you charged us;(1) but, unavoidable interventions have prevented our obtaining their Resolution on them all, previous to the date hereof. The intense heat of this Season, and the great length of the march, make it almost certain, that an order for the North Carolina Troops to Join the Southern army, would be attended with Consequences, fatal to their health, and Such as must deprive the public of their Services, every where, during this Campaign, if not forever, it was therefore Judged most expedient, to postpone Such orders, until they can be executed with out Such imminent hazard of Inconvenience.(2) The Resolutions relative to the decried Emissions,(3) are the best which we have been able to obtain; altho, in our Opinion, they are not altogether So well Calculated for the relief of the Sufferers, especially in our Country, as they might have been. But the measure, by which they were decried, and from which great public good was expected, has Still many advocates in Congress, notwithstanding the Experience of all parts of America groans under the Evils it has produced. The Congress has, with great reluctance, granted, even the partial payment of your draught in our favor.(4) The Continental Currency is so much depreciated, that every one Sees the Necessity of putting an entire Stop to emissions; and relying on the Exertions of the States for Supplying the public Necessaries. The Power of the States, JULY 15, 1779  internally, is much better understood, much better Established, much more Simple and vigorous in its Operations relative to public Credit, and, let us add, much more relied on, than that of Congress. It is therefore more Competent to give Securities, which will give value to paper Currency, than Congress, in their unconfederated State, can give. The Congress, Sensible of this, and also Sensible, that increasing the Continental Emissions must be attended with very injurious Consequences, have taken up Ideas very different from Such as heretofore prevailed. Should the War continue longer than the present Campaign, the States must furnish the Supplies, either by Contributions in kind, or by Taxes in money; and these are the chief Resources which the Congress have at present in View. They will probably have recourse also to Loans; a measure only Justifiable on principles of Necessity; which is burthensom and unequal in a very high degree; and which, it is much to be wished, may be avoidable. For the present Campaign, the Congress wish to provide by Loans, and by what Remains of the former Emissions not yet expended. While intent on this object, it was a great disappointment to them to Receive so great a Requisition, as two millions and a half, from one of the States; and, many deemed it better, to let any one State Struggle through the want of money, than to Send them any from the public Treasury, in its present Circumstances. The resolution was at length taken, to advance One Million; and we were obliged to be Satisfied therewith. It is hoped, that when the State is fully informed of the State of affairs, She will provide for her Exigencies some other way, and forego the remaining part of the requisition. We Confess this to be our wish; and doubt not it would be the wish of our Constituents, were the difficulties of our Finances as well known to them as to us. The Sum granted cannot be paid before the begining of August; and, as Soon as possible, it Shall be Sent forward. If the residue cannot be dispensed with, we Shall make a future application to Congress, but, we are far from being Sanguin in our hopes of Success. We thank your Excellency, for the further information you have given us, relative to the proceedings of the assembly. We feel the highest Satisfaction, from the generous provisions made for our fellow Citizens in the army. Permit us, however, to represent to you Sir, that the Intentions of the assembly with Respect to the Cloathing for the officers, are far from being carried into due Execution, and we beg leave to Recommend it to your attention; relying on your Exertions in behalf of So meritorious a body of our Citizens. The Assembly have always manifested, Intentions very liberal, in providing for the Expences of their Delegates; but, it is impossible to Judge, how adequate any allowance will prove, to the unavoidable disbursements. We Sincerely wish, that all our Citizens were well armed; and, to press the Necessity thereof on our fellow Citizens. The Predatory   war, which we may apprehend hereafter, if hostilities shall continue, will require, every where vigilence, readiness and vigor. We are convinced, that So far as the first, and last can avail, our Country will be Safe while you preside over her, but, without Arms, our virtue and vigilence can not avail much. We wish it to be thought an object of the highest Consequence to Supply them. You will See, by the inclosed papers, that a descent has been made in Connecticut; and we have advice from Europe, that it was planned in the British Cabinet.(5) This is a proof, at once, of the predatory designs of the Enemy, and of that imbecility which prevents them from carrying on Operations of greater vigor, and more competent to their design of Conquest. We wish we could give you a Satisfactory Idea of our foreign affairs; but they are Still in So obscure, and undecided A State that this is impossible. We are also yet under Strict Injunctions of Secrecy: but, Should decisions be made, deeply affecting the happiness and Safety of our Country, we Shall feel ourselves under obligations, Stronger than any other, of laying the whole of the affairs before the State. We are Sorry to find, that we differ in Sentiments with Some of the Delegates of Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware and South Carolina, on Questions, which are of the utmost importance to all, but, peculiarly, So to them, and to us, as States possessing Internal Staples, and being composed chiefly of Husbandmen. Jersey, Deleware and South Carolina, on the Questions alluded to, are usually divided; Pennsylvania votes differently from us, but, we have the Satisfaction to find, that New York, Maryland, and Virginia Concur with us. We lament that our Eastern bretheren have, at present, objects in view, in the pursuit of which we cannot concur with them; tho we feel every possible disposition to unite with them in all pursuits, not inconsistant with the Safety, and happiness of our Country. We excuse them, because the objects are, to them, Immediately Interesting; but, in our Opinion, not so much so to all, or to any of the States as to Justify Some measures that are under Consideration. We have the honor to be with great respect yr. Exys obt. Serts, John Penn Thos. Burke Wm. Sharpe [P.S.] Three hundred and thirty Dollars have been advanced to the Express for which he has given a Receipt to be accountable to you. General Hogan desires the inclosed to be Submitted to your Inspection, in order to give an Idea of the Expence of Trimmings, which not having been sent with Some Cloath which came forward from the State, puts the officers under the Necessity of purchasing them here, at an Expence which very few can bear.

7543,dg013237,1779,Thomas Burke s Epistle,"""Thomas Burke's \""Epistle\""   [July 16? 1779] An EPISTLE Hail, mighty Thomas!(1) In whose works are seen A mangled Morris and distorted Deane; Whose splendid periods flash for Lees defence, Replete with every thing but common sense. You by whose labors no man e'er was wiser, You of invective, great monopolizer; You who, unfeeling as a Jew or Turk, Attack a J-y, a P-a, and a B-ke;(2) You who, in fervor of satiric vein, Maul and abuse the mild and meek Du-e;(3) And eager to traduce the worthiest men, Despise the energy of Drayton's pen. O say, what name shall dignify the lays, Which now I consecrate to sing thy praise; In pity tell, by what exalted name Thou would'st be damn'd to an eternal fame. Shall Common Sense, or Comus greet thine ear, A piddling poet, or puft pamphleteer; Behold around thee, how thy triumphs lie, Of reputations hosts before thee die; On envy's altars hecatombs expire, And Faction fondly lights her pupil's fire. That pupil most devoted to her will, Who for the worthless wags his quibbling quill; And with a true democracy of spirit Bravely attacks the most exalted merit. Thou pupil worthy her attentive care, JULY 16, 1779  By Satan granted to her earnest prayer; When on the brink of fate smooth Adams stood, And saw his Arthur flound'ring in the flood. While plausive Richard, in whose gloomy breast Revenge and terror stood by turns confest; Doubtful his brothers measures to defend, With Berkenhout their confidant and friend; Or breaking thro' the weak fraternal ties, To save himself the doctor sacrifice. 'Twas in that desperate, the important hour, When Faction, trembling for her tott'ring pow'r, Thus pour'd her vows-\""Author of ev'ry crime! Whose pangs shall last beyond the reach of time; By all those crimes, and all those pangs, give ear, And if, O sire, thy daughter e'er was dear; If e'er obedient to her father's call, The crowds of Faction fill'd his spacious hall; If e'er the populace by her possest, Have plung'd their daggers in a patriot breast; And forc'd humanity herself to fly, With banish'd Justice to yon azure sky; Attend, attend, attend, my fav'rites see, Their hopeless eyes are fix'd alone on thee; Oh help them, save them, or my sway is o'er, Opprest like thee, like thee to rise no more.\"" The prayer was heard, the dreadful monarch spoke. While Hell convuls'd e'en to her center shook: \""Since on mankind to fix my iron reign, Nor sin, nor death suffice, I give them Payne. \"" Say, mighty Thomas, on what awful day You first beheld the morn's resplendent ray; That day to envy shall most sacred be, And all her squinting sons shall wait on thee. But sure no mortal mother did thee bear, Rather a cholic in the prince of air, On dusky pinions borne o'er Ether's plain, Expell'd thee from him with a griping pain. For as Minerva, queen of sense uncommon, Owed not her birth to goddess or to woman; But softly crept from out her father's scull, At a small crack in't when the moon was full; So you, great Common Sense, did surely come From out the crack in grisly Pluto's bum. Such as thy origin such be thy fate, To war 'gainst virtue with a deadly hate; By daily slanders earn thy daily food, Exalt the wicked, and depress the good;  And having spent a lengthy life in evil, Return again unto thy parent Devil.

For the context of the debate over the latter issue in which Burke chose this moment to attack Paine, see Gouverneur Morris to Benjamin Towne, July 9, 1779, note 1. Ironically, Burke's \""Epistle\"" appeared in this issue immediately following Paine's public response to the attack on him by \""Cato\"" (Gouverneur Morris) that Towne had printed in the July 9 issue of the Post. It has been analyzed in the context of his verse writings in Richard Walser, ed., The Poems of Governor Thomas Burke of North Carolina (Raleigh, N.C.: State Department of Archives and History, 1961), pp. 50-51, 66-67. 2 That is, John Jay, William Paca, and Thomas Burke. 3 James Duane.""

July 16. 1779 We find from the Minister of France that your Appointment has given high Satisfaction to his Court, and we are encouraged to expect Proofs of its most confidential Reliance upon your Character.(1) We have not had a Line from you of this Year's date; indeed I believe your latest is of Novr. 7th 1778. Two days ago we received several Letters from Doctor Lee and one from Mr. Izard; the latter of March 4th, the former up to April 6th. The Vessel was from Rochelle about the middle of May. It was unfortunate that we did not get the Information of Mr. Lee earlier respecting the Enemy's designs against Connecticutt. They had accomplished Part of them a few days before. Will no one under a Commission from these United States retaliate on the Coasts of England for the Burning of our beautiful Fairfield? A single Privateer might, I think show, there, a striking Sample of the Species of War now carried on by Britain against America. We are told this Evening that Genl. Lincoln has had an Advantage over Prevost in an open Field Fight in which the Militia behaved to Admiration, on the 20th of June.(2) We forward two Letters for \""Our great faithful beloved Friend & Ally, Louis sixteenth King of France & Navarre.\""(3) We submit, however, the Superscription to your Judgement. You will manage the Invoices by your best Abilities.(4) The Probability of Success was held up to us by one who doubtless makes known by this Opportunity how much our present Circumstances render such Aids essential to us. A Report of the Treasury respecting the just Stipend of our late & present Ministers at foreign Courts is not quite determined upon. A  JULY 16, 1779  Determination is peculiarly necessary as to Mr. W.

Presuming from Report and a Passage of a Letter from Doctr. Lee that Mr. Adams is on his Return hither, We do not write to him now. Should he remain in France we beg he may be made acquainted with the Cause of our Omission. Good as this Opportunity is we expect very shortly a much better when we shall renew Assurances of being, Honble. Sir, Your most humble Servants, James Lovell for the Committee of for. Affairs. P. S.

Washington and another to Govr. Trumbull but alas, too late! Fairfield had been destroyed by the Fire of the Enemy. We are mistaken however if that Enemy does not find the unprofitableness of this Kind of Warefare towards their main purpose. America JULY 16, 1779  must be dead indeed to all proper Spirit if such doings will not render her both Vigilant & active, as in the begining of the Contest. It is matter of much Conjecture why you have not been able for some months back to give us interesting Accounts from Spain: All we know is through Mr. Gérard.(3) We have sent so many Setts of the Journals of Congress that you will doubtless get one.

Mr. Izard and myself would have accompanyed him had not our Commissions prevented us.\"" My dear Madam The above is an Extract from a letter of Ar. Lee to Mr. S. Adams (2) and tho Mr. Lee writes afterwards on April 6th yet it was a very short Letter of Information concerning the Enemys Plan against Connecticutt, just as they have lately proceeded. He says not a Syllable therein about Mr. Adams; but it is currently reported here that he was at a Port of Embarkation before the Vessel now here left France. I suspect he is on board the Alliance Frigate; perhaps while I am writing he is embracing you.(3) If not, you may find by a confidential Moment or two with his worthy Namesake in Boston the probable Cause of his not waiting for some special Direction from hence. Staying or Returning, I am sure he has done right; he has acted like a Man of Judgement, Probity and Spirit: Therefore it is that I express no Surprize at the written Intelligence or the Report. I refer you to Mr. S. A (4) for the Communications which should make your Bosom easy if it is capable of suspecting my Mr. Adams of Rashness. I will not without absolute Necessity risque to the Accidents of Carriage on the Road, at this Time, all that I could say about the probable Causes of this unexpected Return. The Knowledge of your being in any Pain about it, after having seen the Gentlemen to whom I have referred you, will constitute such Necessity. For, be assured, the Sacrifices you have made to the public Good and the Manner in which you have made them have given you a despotic Command over my Affections. And, here, by way of Attonement for the Voice I have once given against your private &  JULY 16, 1779  personal Felicity, I do soberly promise that, unless there is a great Change for the better in the Manners of America, I will not speedily exert myself in any way for the self same Purpose, but leave Portia in the full Enjoyment of Days twenty-five hours long. Very platonically to be sure but, very, very affectionately, your humb. Servt., J L [P.S.] 3 Ship Captains say Genl. Lincoln gained a Battle on the 20th of June in a fair Field, each side quitting their Lines. The devilish Lies before were told by a Mate. The odds of Title is not all. Capt. Sergeant of Cape Ann who left Carolina the 23d told the Story in the Teeth of the Delegates of his own State in their Parlour. Perhaps I may get some particulars from Col. Laurens late President who, I hear, has examined the Gentlemen. JL I broke the Seal to warn you against the News. Col. Laurens told me a very fine Story which he believes from \""the very ingenious Manner in which it was detailed to him\"".

7551,dg013245,1779,James Lovell to Samuel Adams,"""James Lovell to Samuel Adams   Dear Sir July 16. 1779 We have had Letters from A Lee to Apr. 6. and one from R. Izard of March 4th (1) in wch. he requests permission to resign. Mr. A. L. sent a Reply to Deane's Accusations which has given me great Satisfaction, tis 32 folio pages long founded on two Peices which we sent him last Octobr., but which did not reach him till Feby.(2) It is impossible for me now to give you any part of it; but I will take occasion to send you Extracts of what are the only new Things JULY 16, 1779  to you and me, I mean the first of the only two Letters he has written to Ld. Shelburne since he left England for our Service, and a Letter from Mr. Jennings with his Answer concerning Berkenhout & Temple. The Reading of the first made his most capital Opponents press their fingers on their Eye to prevent that water from discovering itself in a Drop, which will rise & collect upon a sudden Stroke of Admiration. Their Orbs were full. The other two letters mentioned relative to Berkenhout are the most striking Proofs of Integrity & sound prophetic Judgement, as well as a compleat Refutation of all the malicious Innuendo of Deane & party in their Gazette & Memorial-Appearances . William (3) being absent Arthur undertakes and Accomplishes a full Defence of him against the Calumnies levelled at him particularly. I must regret that the Papers now arrived did not come before you and Richard (4) left us. I cannot tell you all the Reasons why by this opportunity, I will do it by Somebody who can destroy my Letter in case of Surprize & Capture on the Road. Most of the Reasons will readily suggest themselves. I took the freedom of opening a large Packet directed to Richd. or in his Absence to F Lee strongly judging it contained what it did-a memorial in the Letter Form Inscribed to the President of Congress with a Packet of Vouchers chiefly attested by J Adams. There was another Letter directed to R or F or J L.(5) This is have by me as it was an Individual confidential Power unconnected with Congress, but of a very extraordinary Kind. There was one Letter for Frank & two for Richd. which I have sent on. I have not the same right to open them as I have to open yours. This last I have done, and I now exercise another Right founded on Reasons to be hereafter told; it is to charge you keep, at present, a profound secret the parts which I have marked.(6) I wish to have a Copy or the original by the return of the Express as I have been utterly incapable of taking a Copy myself. I will do much more pen work for you tho there is not a like necessity for it. His letter of Apr 6 tells us the exact plan of ravaging Fairfield which has been executed, it is most unfortunate that the Vessel stayd a month at Rochelle after leaving Nantes. A certain Baron Holtzendorffe has memorialized me to Doctr. Fr[ankli]n and given some curious Conversations and Anecdotes calculated for the ministerial Eye, as Arthur says, in which I am an inveterate Anti-Gallican and a most malignant Anti Deanite.(7) He demands of the Doctor £20,000 for his Expences because he was not kept in Employ here. He went off in Mr. Laurences Debt from York Town 400 dollars. I fear my desire to chit-chat with you will draw me to a neglect of some of the purposes of sending the Express in haste so soon after another has left us. The Expence might have been prevented if only, the Gentleman in the Chair would complaisantly tell the House of his Intentions to send from Time to Time. A Thing he never does.   Tell Dana I am glad he gives me so much occasion to drop writing to him. I did not foresee all the Advantages of Mr. H's (8) & his Conduct in this Respect some Time ago, and therefore was nettled at first, but that is quite over. If I am not mistaken I shall be in the same Way with another Gentleman.(9) He sets out fair for it. He could not find a Quill in 8 days after his arrival at Boston any more than on the Road thither.

The enemy were soon obliged to their Ships for protection, what place will be the next object of their vengance is not known.

Whatever may be the Effect of this Application, of which your own prudence will dictate the proper use, You are to proceed on the Treaty, taking Care, that the Powers of the British Ministers are in  JULY 17, 1779  good Form & sufficiently full, & that nothing is contained in their Credentials derogatory to or in any Manner operating against the Freedom, Sovereignty & Independance of these States absolute & unlimited as well in Matters of Government as of Commerce. When the Conferences shall be opened, You may declare, that You are ready to sign a Treaty of Peace with G. B. on her acknowledging therein the Liberty, Sovereignty & Independance absolute & unlimited of these States, as well in Matters of Government as of Commerce, ascertaining the Limits of these States according to the first Resolution inclosed. If the British Ministers shall absolutely decline to make the before mentioned acknowledgement of the Freedom, Independance &ca of these States, and You find it absolutely necessary to admit some mezzo termine-You shall insist on this Mode of Expression, that \""the King of G. B. agrees to treat with the people of N.H., M.B. R.I. & P.P., C., N.Y., N.J., P., D., M., V., N.C., S.C., & G. as free & independant States vested with & possessing Sovereignty absolute & unlimited as well in Matters of Government as of Commerce\""-and from this Mode of Expression You are in no Manner to deviate, unless it be to admit some other more strong & positive in Favour of the Freedom, Independance & Sovereignty of these States. If the British Ministers will consent to proceed with the Treaty of Peace on this Footing, You are then to insist on the Limits of these States being ascertained in the Manner before mentioned-on an immediate Evacuation thereof by all the British land & naval Forces- the full Enjoyment thereof by these States-a Release of all Prisoners without Ransom-(3) and from these points you are in no Manner to Recede. You may also insert such other articles as are usual in mere Treaties of Peace-see Articles 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 of the Treaty of Amity & Commerce at Paris Feb 6, 1778. You are to observe, that You are not to propose the last mentioned Mode of Expression, unless the French & Spanish Courts shall solemnly declare their Sense of the Treaty of Paris in 1778 to be, that France is not thereby bound to contend for one more strong & positive in Favour of these States & France will not agree to contend for such an one. If the British Ministers shall decline signing a Treaty of Peace, unless the Terms of a Treaty of Amity & Commerce be in some Degree previously determined, & such Determination cannot be avoided without an Appearance of Artifice, You are to declare, that immediately after signing and ratifying such a Treaty of Peace as is before mentioned, you are ready to sign a Treaty of Amity & Commerce on just & reasonable Terms. After this Declaration, You are to endeavour by all the Means in your power to procure the Treaty of peace to be signed ascertaining the Limits of these States  as mentioned in the Resolution inclosed-and to have the Treaty ratified by the King of Great Britain, before You proceed to the Treaty of Amity & Commerce. If You cannot procure the Treaty of Peace to be thus signed and ratified without an Explanation of the Terms \""just & Reasonable,\"" You may declare, that You are not authorized to say any Thing more on the subject, till the Treaty of Peace shall be signed & ratified as aforesaid-that when that shall be done, the Regard due to the exalted Dignity & undoubted Equity of the Mediating power & to the Honor of the United States, together with the earnest Desire they feel of demonstrating to the whole World on this signal Occasion that Moderation of Temper (with respect to their Interests) by which they wish to be allways distinguished, will forbid them to urge propositions inconsistent with the Sentiments impress'd by the foregoing Considerations-besides, that a proper Attention to the well known Advantages to be expected from the British Friendship & Commerce, would prevent them from insisting on any points that might cause an Obstruction to their receiving those Advantages. If the British Ministers shall utterly refuse to sign the Treaty of Peace & to procure its Ratification aforesaid without a farther Explanation of a Treaty of Amity & Commerce, You are with equal Firmness to refuse such Explanation, and-You may alledge, that the two Treaties are distinct in their Nature-that the one is founded on the Maxims of Religion & Humanity, calculated for putting an End to the farther Effusion of Christian Blood, & the Calamities of War-the other founded on the Motive of Gain-that to refuse an Assent to the first, unless the Measure of the latter be previously ascertained, would be to sacrifice the noblest principles of Conduct to Views of a far inferior Value, that this method of proceeding is not unsupported by precedent-for the Treaty of Commerce between Spain & The United Provinces was not brought to a Conclusion till a considerable Time after the Treaty of Peace at Munster. If the point shall be still insisted on by the British Ministers as is before mentioned, & You find there is Reason to be convinc'd, that the Treaty of Peace will fail upon it, You are to endeavour in the most prudent Manner You can devise, to discover the Conditions on which those Ministers will consent to sign a Treaty of Amity & Commerce-particularly, whether they will consent to insert an Article in it, that Great Britain will not disturb the Inhabitants of these States in the Exercise of the Fisheries on the Banks of New Foundland & other the Fishing Banks & Seas of North America, with a reciprocal one on the part of these States limiting a reasonable Distance if it be insisted on by the British Ministers within which neither party shall in the Exercise of such Fisheries approach the Coasts of the other, whether of the Continent or Islands. If You can be assured, that they will consent to insert such an   Article, then, You are to proceed to an Explanation of the Terms on which You will sign a Treaty of Amity & Commerce, the Basis thereof to be an Equality and Reciprocity of Benefits,(4) & taking Care, that the said Distance be so limited as not to be less than about three Leagues, nor greater than about fifteen Leagues. If the British Ministers shall consent to sign the Treaty of Peace in Manner before mentioned without insisting on an Explanation as aforesaid of the Terms to be contained in the Treaty of Amity & Commerce, and then the Conferences turn on this Treaty, You are to Treat on the Basis aforesaid. Whenever in the Course of the Conferences, the said Fisheries shall be mentioned, which they are not to be by You, if it can be avoided, You are to propose, for avoiding Disputes, the Insertion of the Article aforesaid relating to them. If this proposition shall be objected to, You are in support of it, to alledge the Common Right to such Fisheries-the Right vested in these States by occupancy & the necessity of procuring Subsistance, & the Right of Compensation for the Expences & Damages of an unprovoked defensive War &c. The Arguments in support of the first & last of these Topics, You may draw from the principles of Justice, and the Laws of Nature and Nations. As to the second, if the British Ministers shall urge, that the Right vested in these States by Occupancy, was vested in the Inhabitants as Subjects of the British Crown, You are to observe, that those Inhabitants were a part of the people of the Empire, and that on a just Separation of the people, a partition of the Rights before exercised in Common becomes also just, as attached to the persons of those thus separating & before the separation thus exercising those Rights-Otherwise, the first Injustice in causing a Separation would become a Foundation for & sanction of a second Injustice, which is a proposition operating too strongly against the universal Sense of Mankind, to be supportable-that this Argument is greatly fortified by the Necessity of procuring Subsistance, which is annexed to the Occupancy, a Necessity that is allways growing more strait by the Encrease of Inhabitants-that this Right is also strengthened, by this Circumstance, that the Dominions which may remain to Great Britain on a Pacification have been acquired or secured to her by the Exertions of these States as well as her own- that a Right thus vested in them cannot be impaired in any Manner by the prosecution of such a War as the present or any separation thereby occasioned of the Members of the Empire-that even a Right of trading to the East Indies acquired by Occupancy and that but for a short Time \""flagrante bello\"" between Spain & the United Provinces of the Low Countries, was confirmed to them at the Peace of Munster-A fortiori, should this Right so antient, so established before the War, so continued & uninterrupted, be confirmed to these States. You may also give up on Behalf of these States any Trade to the  East Indies & to Africa, while they continue undisturbed by Great Britain in the said Fisheries. If the British Ministers absolutely refuse to admit such an Article relating to the Fisheries as is before mentioned, You are then to propose this Mode of Expression, \""that Commerce shall in every Respect be restored to the same State in which it was before the present War, excepting every Exclusion, Regulation & Restriction, prior to the signing of the said Treaty, in Preference of Great Britain to any other Nation now in or that hereafter shall be in Amity with these States, or in any Manner or by any Construction implying a Dependance or Subordination of these States on or to Great Britain or the Crown thereof\""-and from this Mode of Expression You are in no Manner to deviate, unless it be to admit some other more strong and positive in favour of the Freedom, Independance & Sovereignty of these States. But You are to observe, that You are not to propose this Mode of Expression, unless (5) You are positively assured, that the French & Spanish Courts will be highly disgusted if You refuse to admit such a Mode. If this Mode or one more favorable to these States is admitted, but not an express Stipulation, You are if possible to procure.(6) If the British Ministers shall utterly refuse to treat of a perpetual Peace, but shall offer to treat of a Truce, and the French & Spanish Courts shall solemnly declare their Sense of the Treaty of Paris in 1778 to be, that France is not thereby bound to contend for a perpetual Peace, & She shall not agree to contend for it, and that the treating of & agreeing to a Truce cannot be denied or refused by these States without giving high Disgust to those Courts, You are then to proceed to treat of a Truce, in treating of which You are to conduct Yourself exactly in the Manner herein before pointed out for treating of a perpetual Peace, to use all the Means in your power to procure as long a Truce as can possibly be obtained, and as great Security as can be also obtained against any considerable naval or land Forces being kept in the Dominions that may remain to G. B. at the Conclusion of the War, on which Heads You are to regulate Yourself by the Necessity You shall find imposed upon You of conforming to the Sentiments of their most Christian and most Catholic Majesties.(7) In the Course of the Negotiations You are not to omit any Opportunity of sending To Congress the earliest advices of every Step taken therein & of every Difficulty that occurrs, so as to enable Us in the most full & ample Manner to judge of all the proceedings. In sending these Advices, You will use every precaution to prevent your Dispatches falling into the Hands of the Enemy, & You will also send so many Copies of each Letter, as to remove every probability of our failing to receive the Intelligence designed for Us (8) These propositions, except the last ten Lines, were read by Me in   Congress on Saturday the 17th Day of July 1779 in the Afternoon between 3 & 4 oClock, after Congress had postponed a proposition containing a Principle in its very Nature tending to delay a pacification formally or tacitly assuring the Liberty, Sovereignty & Independance of these States absolute & unlimited as well in Matters of Government as of Commerce.

7562,dg013256,1779,Henry Laurens to John Laurens,"""Henry Laurens to John Laurens   My Dear Son, Philadelphia 17th July 1779. My last communication is dated the 10th Inst.,(1) it was forwarded by the hands of Sickle a public Messenger. Yours of the 2d. June written I perceive with your left hand reached me no earlier than the 12th Inst. This is the Letter which Mr. Leger left in the custody of Colo. Finnie; you refer me very particularly to an anticedent date, but none such respecting Military operations in & about Charles Town have I seen. Recollect if you can, its date & by whom you transmitted it, & I will endeavor to discover the defaulter or the delinquent. Dunlap's Paper of this Morning does not inform us as I had expected it would, of the operations of the American Duke d'Alva, late Governor Tryon in Connecticut, he landed at New Haven burnt part & probably the whole of that Town, penetrated to & burnt all Fairfield said to be one of the prettiest Towns in America. The Militia assembled, attacked him & he fled to his Ships-this is a general sketch warranted by Rivington of the 10th Inst. with this difference, he says re-embarked. I wish the title of d'Alva may be so fixed on Tryon as to be transmitted to posterity & his memory held in everlasting contempt. Yesterday we received in Congress dispatches from the Honorable Arthur Lee Esqr containing as complete a vindication, of his own & his Brother William's conduct, as I have ever seen in any case, every charge of Deane's 5th December refuted, every article supported by vouchers-what a worse figure will this bad servant make before his fellow Citizens to whom he appealed, when his narrative of 139 Pages of vanity, misrepresentation, falsehood & contradiction shall pass under the harrow of Lee's Pen-those who have hitherto been his supporters, appeared to be unhappy while the Papers were reading. Tell my friends they will find, that my resignation on the 9th December was, as I then said to them, the greatest act of my Life. I have heard nothing lately from head Quarters-the very plentiful harvest, which we have now secured, leads to animation, we are talking of an immediate array of Six or twelve Thousand good Militia, these to join the Commander in Chief & to attack New York; a motion made by Mr. Dickinson seconded by Mr Drayton that Congress should join the Army & act in Militaire (2)-this shews more of valour in those Gentlemen than of the wisdom & reflection of grave Senators, but who can restrain the ardor of fighting Men when an opportunity offers? The Motion is on the Table for consideration when it can be taken up consistently with Order. If I may judge of the state of your (Carolina air, from the Philadelphia Thermometer you have hitherto had very tolerable weather, I was just now obliged to throw off a lined-silk, & to cover my body  JULY 17, 1779  with a Cloth flannel-lined, wastcoat, & I took a little Cold last night by Iying under only a thick Cotton coverlid. We have not experienced one intolerable day the present Summer. I say nothing of my private affairs. I know you will aid Mr. Gervais in taking as much thought for them as the times will admit of. I remain here under the Commands of my fellow Citizens when my inclinations strongly bend homeward, 'tis high time I were there. I pray God to bless & protect you, Henry Laurens [P.S.] 36 days since we heard from So Carolina. I interpret nothing amiss from this silence. ""

By the hand of Major Rice I was honoured with your favor of the 5th Ulto.(1) The Major left Philadelphia the 13th Inst. intended for Boston to take Gen Washington's Camp in the way. I have done all in my power to serve my old friend Mr. Bryan & I hope by some means to effectuate an Exchange for himself & his Son, (2) it will probably be out of the common rotine, because Congress will not encourage kidnapping by Exchanging Citizens taken in the manner those Gentlemen were captured. I have written more particularly on this subject to Mr. Houstoun . . .(3) The American Duke d'Alva, Tryon has been brandishing the torch in Connecticut, has burnt Fairfield & part or the whole of New Haven, made some plunder, distressed Women & Children & retired again to his Ships, many particulars ought to have been published in Dunlap's Paper of today, but he has neglected them. Thirty six days have passed over since the latest date from Charles Town, the silence is painful, but it does not indicate evil on our part; I do not despair of an opportunity for congratulating with you Sir & with my Country Men in general on an event which will mark honor to you & them & restore my native Country the Peace her peculiar circumstances require. In truth Sir, should you fairly drive the Enemy from Carolina & Georgia or do what would be better, detain them there in captivity, you will lay the Corner stone for an immediate general peace. Had Georgia been defended, we should at this moment have been engaged in a general Treaty. The Capture of that State has cost us a Campaign of blood & conflagration. I beg Sir you will be assured of my best wishes for your health &  JULY 17, 1779  success & that I am with great Esteem & Regard, Your obedient & most humble servt, Henry Laurens. ""

July 17th. 1779 I wrote to you on the 13th of June, but to my Surprise found the Letter in the commercial Committee Rooms on the 10th of July, the Martinico man having left it behind though he took the Journals & Gazettes to be forwarded by Mr. Bingham to France & the Hague. My above mentioned Letter was sent under Cover to Mr. Adams to the Care of Doctr. Franklin, it seems Mr. A will have left France before the Polacre comd. by Capt. Sapet can reach it. (1) It is needless to copy the whole as, now, the Weeks of the Journals are printed to which I there referred largely. Some parts however I shall now repeat.(2) Extr June 13. \""The Term recalled having been used in regard to Wm. Lee and Rph. Izard with an Idea strenuously supported by some of bringing them to America, tho others who were affirmative meant only vacating the Commissions a second Resolve passed that they need not repair to America. I give them no official notice now nor shall I without the particular order of Congress because I am again left alone, your Brother Richd. having resigned his Seat as I hear, and gone home; and further, because something definitive ought to be decided in regard to Compensation for Services of the Commissioners. \""An attempt has several times lately been made to chuse a new Committee of for. Affrs. instead of filling up the old one. This you will perceive to be singularly decent towards the one who had steadily attended. Nay it is said that such a Comtee. is useless. I am sure I find an immense deal that ought to be done, and have found a great Burthen in what has been done by a Member of Congress without Secretary or Clerk, little as you and the other Gentlemen abroad may have been benefited by my Labors. Quires of my Writing have been sunk in the Seas most of it near these Capes. \""I expect further attempts to get rid of you.

I have by me large packets left by yr. Brother, with Copies of Proceedings respecting you, but I will not send them round about as a Frigate must soon go directly from hence, or at least a Pacqt.

Your Quotation from Whitlock I have read in the Congress to strengthen what I have often urged there.(4) Nothing can more naturally suggest itself to a Politician, one would think yet I have affirmed Truth when I told you that the Comtee. was said to be now an useless Institution. What remark am I to now make upon some of yr. Conduct referable to the 5th Line of the 3d page of this Sheet? (5) I will not trust my own Judgement, but I suspect your most steady friends here will differ. l presume you meant to take their Opinions as you could not at such a distance judge of all Circumstances. Else why cover to R H or F. L (6) At present a Veil of Secresy is on the Business, as well as on that committed to R. H. or F. L. or J. L.(7) Your Letter defensery has been read.(8) Yr. first Letter to Shelburn brought that Water up to the Eyes of some, who are evidently unfriendly to you, which is the Consequence of strong unexpected Admiration. The Letter from Jennings and your Answer are as valuable as a marble Pillar erected to the honor of yr. Probity and prophetic sound Judgement. Beux's is as honorary to him as a sensible spirited Gentleman as it is disgraceful to others. All the other Vouchers were familiar to me. I have been so engaged & so unwell that I have only had the single chance of listning in Congress; but I shall renew my Pleasure soon. The Report respectg. Supporting the Ministers was again recommitted this day but I told the House that I could not risque Censure by not officially informing Mr. W Lee & Mr. Izard of the Proceedings of the 8th of June. How easy & how tollerably decent would it have been to have recalled their Commissions for the Reasons h[anded] down in the original Report of the Committee of 13-vid 2d head Apr. 15th, but the 4th head was meant to accomplish the point with you; the most sanguine not being discouraged at the Idea of Killing Doctr.

I there heard the Vindication read, but there is a Man who can never read distinctly & deliberately when he does not like the subject-long debates, whether the Vouchers shd. be read at length carried in the affirmative. I recd. much satisfaction, but not so with every body. One seemed to be on a Gridiron, another in Purgatory, another attempting to take notes, but the subject was painfull, he sickened & threw down his pen, one looked to be in a situation in which he ought long since to have been-suspended- from his eternal versatility. I suspect he will become a reconvert.(2) My best complim'ts to Mr. F. L. Lee. I feel myself happy in finding I have taken the honest side, & that I may therefore congratulate with your families & all your friends; I shd. have crept into an auger hole had it appeared that I had (altho mistakenly) been an advocate for a rogue-little as I have left of worldly wealth, I wd. give 500 Guineas JULY 17, 1779  for A. Lee's company tonight in this room. He shd. not leave Phila. untill he had pointed out the way for obtaining Justice to his injured Country; his Country wou'd not part with him untill they had done him honor. An honest man's face the noblest work of God. This morning I mean to move Congress to order the vindication of the h'ble Arthur Lee Esqr. together with all the supporting Vouchers to be made public.(3) Mr. D appealed to the Public, which in his elegant style, \""caused great sensations\"". The Public therefore have a right to know what has been said by the other party, & I am perswaded when they are informed that an ansr. is recd. they will assert their right & demand information. We have made no progress either in finances of foreign affairs, except in the former case, what you must have seen published, & in the latter, another private audience, the product of which, my discretion, not my obligation, restrains me from divulging.(4) I peremptorily & repeatedly refused to give my promise to keep secret anything called by that Name in the State House. In the present case I had the best reason in the World for mak'g the declaration, the secret was communicated to a few select friends, before it was announced from the Chair, one of these elect, immediately transmitted it to a place some 700 miles distant,(5) & afterward with a very grave white face pledged his honor to keep all Mum. I charged him home, he laught guilt & did not deny. Nevertheless I will not follow the bad example, nor do an inexpedient Act, because it is barely Lawfull. In due time you will know all. The appointm't of Doctor Franklin to be sole Minister at the Court of Versailes, has afforded the greatest satisfact'n \""& now the confidence of the Court will be no longer withheld\""-be this as it may, we receive no intelligence from our Servants, except from the suspected person,(6) & his Accts. are as ample, as Valid, & as clear as any we receive from the fountain above them. This is queer, he is suspected, not trusted, yet he is honest, learns & communicates everything. Mr. A. Lee has apprized us of the ravaging scheme in Connecticut plotted at White Hall, which is at this instant in execution under the auspices of Genl. Tryon. If Congress now suffer Mr. D to leave the American shore, before he shall have settled his Accts. or shall have given good & sufficient security to acct. for all the public money which has passed thro' his hands, we shall have to account for our own Conduct to the People at large.

To remedy this Evil, Congress did, on the 14th Day of December last appoint a new Committee of Commerce who will be enabled to conduct their affairs with regularity in future. We are now to acknowledge the Receipt of your several Letters of the following Dates with their Inclosures, Vizt. 6th March-1st & 2d April-7th, 8th & 20th May-6th July-3d & 11th Augt.-11th September-5th, 8th, 10th, 18th, 26th October, and 15th December 1778-17th Feby.-10 & 18th April and 2d May 1779-The latter by Capt Calvert Duplicated by Capt. Joseph Conand.(2) It is with Concern we inform you that of the several Vessells sent out by you for these Coasts with Effects, not one of them is safe arrived. The Sloop in which Captain Willing embarked was captured near the Capes of Delaware, and himself carried to Newyork where he now remains a Prisoner; Messrs. Elliot & McIntyre overpowered the Prize Master, retook the Sloop, and ran her on shore near Lewis Town, saved part of the Cargo, for which they were entitled to a Moiety for Salvage. Captain Morain ran the Sloop Bernardo on shore at Cape Hatteras; a trifling part of the Cargo was saved & brought up to Edenton, the Vessell lost. The Brigt. Minerva on her Passage from the Havana was captured by a British Cruizer, retaken by an American Armed Vessell & brot. into North Carolina where a Moiety of the whole was adjudged for Salvage. None others have we as yet received any intelligence of (The Capt. & People's Wages paid). We are also to advise you that immediately upon Receipt of Your Letter of 2d May we applied at the Office of Insurance in order to cover Your 8000 Dollars on the Sloop N[ossa] S[enhora] de Carmel, Capt. Luiz Perez, but without effect, as by your Letter you were to dispatch her in three or four Days & upwards of two months having elapsed, they concluded her to be out of time, and therefore would not meddle with the risque. Upon laying your Letters before Congress this Committee procured the inclosed Resolves, by which Youll perceive they are fully  JULY 19, 1779  impowered to exert every possible means of making you Remittances,(3) but from the present local circumstances of this Country it will not be in their power to do anything considerable untill the new Wheat is manufactured, of which we have had this Season the finest Crops, both as to quantity & quality that has been Known this many Years- indeed the Crops of the preceding Year, were not only scant, but the Wheat of Maryland & Virginia infected by a fly that rendered a great part thereof unfit for use-this added to the great Supplies for our Armies, together with the necessity we were under of largely supplying the Count D'Estaing's Fleet at Boston, obliged the States to lay a general Embargo on all Provision which we now expect will soon be removed upon the arrival of new Flour at our Markets, when we shall exert ourselves in shipping large quantities to New Orleans, and we think with you that it will be safest Via the Havana, where it may be reshipped to You in Spanish Bottoms, provided there is not a Rupture between that Court & Great Britain, and that it be admitted by the Spanish Governor, whose permission it will be necessary for us previously to obtain. As Vessells are lately permitted to pass & repass between this & the Havana for the conveniency of Don Juan De Miralles, a Spanish Gentleman now residing in this City, by one of which this is forewarded we think this will be the best mode of conveyance for our future Correspondance, and thereby avoid the very enormous expence of sending Expresses as heretofore practised, more especially as you draw upon us for their Expenditures in spanish P[iece]s 8/8, which is not in our power to obtain, having only Paper money circulating in these united States. From Your Letters and Accounts we learn that several Sums of money have been advanced by you for the State of Virginia, on an Expedition under the Command of Colonel David Rogers & Colo. George Roger Clarke for the reduction of the Post of St. Vincent, we are led to conclude from Your Letters &ca. that the several Parcels of Goods you sent up the Mississippi were chiefly applied by the State of Virginia, as we have never received any advice from Fort Pitt of their arrival there, it will be therefore necessary for your Government to charge the State of Virginia with all such advances, and not blend it with Your Accounts with this Committee, and let us know the amount thereof. By Your Letter of 15th December we learn that You had purchased the Brigt Minerva Ps. 2200 for which you had drawn on us in favor of Capt. Joseph Farribault, this Bill has not yet appeared, and when it does it will not be in our power to honor that as well as those drawn in favor of Capt. Joseph Conand, and Joseph Calvert for the reasons already assigned, unless they will receive our Currant Paper money at the present governing Exchange, i.e Six Paper Dollars for one Spanish; and this they decline as the Paper money is of no use to  them out of these States; must therefore desire You to settle with them at Orleans. To enable Capt. Calvert to defray his Expences at the Havana we have furnished him with Dn. Juan De Miralles's Draft on his Lady for forty Dollars, for which You have Capt. Calvert's Receipt that he may account with You therefor. Captain Calvert has proposed to this Committee that if he could be favored with a Commission he would fit out a private armed Vessell in order to annoy the Enemy; We therefore inclose you a Blank Commission with Bond and Instructions for that purpose. When he has fixed his Vessell, you will please to take his Bond properly executed to remain in your possession, fill up the Blanks in the Commmission, which with the Instructions deliver to him. Your Letter of the 10th April informs us that You had that day drawn on Messrs. Saml. &J. H. Delap at Ninety days sight for 10,897 Dollars, but as it was still uncertain whether Messrs. Delaps may have Funds of your's in their Hands to do Honor to those Bills you had wrote to the Honble Benjamin Franklin Esqr. very minutely on the Subject, in order that he may see those Bills paid for the Credit of these States; we shall corroborate that request pressingly in our Letter to the Ambassador By a Packet Boat that is to be dispatched for France in a few days, and forward Duplicates by others. By a neglect (which could not at the time be avoided) in making Taxation coeval with our Paper Emissions, the latter is encreased to such an enormous quantity as to double the Sum necessary for a medium, and occasion a rapid Depriciation; this has at length opened the Eyes of the People; who readily consent to large Taxations in order to sink a part of the circulating Paper, so as to appreciate gradually the remainder & thereby bring it back nearly to its original Standard. It gives us real pain when we reflect on the many difficulties you have laboured under by your Exertions for the Public cause, and be assured Sir our utmost endeavours shall be used for your speedy Releif. The Ship Morris being originally designed for an armed Cruizer, as such was under the immediate direction of the Marine Board with whom we last night held a Conference, the result was, that the Commercial Committee have the direction of said Ship, and perceiving by your Letter of the 1 5th Decr. She was fitted, Of featured and Manned complete, and You only waited for Orders where to send her, we have Concluded it will at this Juncture be most beneficial for the United States to have her laden with Staves and such other Lumber as is most suitable for the Island of St Domingo, where from the low price of Sugars, Taffia & Molasses, the Lumber may be sufficient to purchase a Cargo of those Articles, with which She may proceed to this, or some of the Neighbouring Ports. If it is in your power to effect it we should be well pleased to have the Scheme carried into   Execution, as the above Articles will be of great use in our Army Hospitals, but if otherwise, we must submit to have her sent immediately to this Port where upon her arrival she will be fitted for a Cruizing Ship. Should You send the Morris to St Domingo we submit the Consignation of the Cargo &ca there to your Direction. We are Sir, Your Most Humble Servt, Frans. Lewis by Order [P.S.] Capt. Calvert has informed the Committee that he had put into your Hands for public use Three Hundred Pieces of 8/8 which he says he was to receive here, and desires us to inform You that Sum is not paid him. Your ut supra, F Lewis (Copy) The 2d of this recd. was signed by F Lewis, James Searle. 3d Novemr. 1779. This will be handed you by Mr. Jos. Conand to whom we have paid your Bill on the Committee dated 10th April in his favor for Fifteen Hundred Spanish Dollars. An Embargo still exists on all Provisions in order to provide sufficient for our Army as well as for the Count D'Estaing's fleet & Army who are daily expected on this part of the Coast from Georgia where he has lately made a Descent.

JULY 19, 1779  \""Do I love the natural Sentiments of the Heart ? Yes, AMIABLE Correspondent, I truly love them; and your little Story was far, very far from non-natural. You was betrayed, it seems, by a Combination of Circumstances such as a tender Sensibility and the Dusk of the Evening, to make a Pressure to your lovely palpitating Bosom which soon after cost you a crying Spell. If I do not forstall you by making a Remark here myself, I shall expect that in your next Letter you will turn my false Wit upon me, and by making natural mean only common, you will tell me that your misfortune had very natural Consequences, since the Celadon or Lothario who was the Means of your Sorrow only smiled at the Tears which he had caused.

7572,dg013266,1779,Marine Committee to Benjamin Franklin,"""Marine Committee to Benjamin Franklin   Sir [post July 19, 1779] (1) Inclosed you have a certified Copy of a Resolution of Congress dated July 19. 1779; by which you will perceive the Marine Committee are empowered and directed by Congress to carry into Execution their Manifesto of the 30 of Octr. 1778.(2) In pursuance of this Authority and for the more speedy accomplishment of the Ends proposed, we authorise and most earnestly request you, to take every Measure in your power, to aid and assist us in the Execution of this Business. JULY 19, 1779  It is not our Intentions to confine the Measures to be used on this Occasion to open and hostile operations; But on the contrary it is expected and we wish and desire that you would cause, at the Expence of the United States, any of the Towns of Great Britain or the West Indies, secretly to be set on fire. In particular London, Bristol, Liverpool, Glasgow and Edinburgh are to be considered as the first objects of national retaliating resentment; and above all, London, the Seat of royal Residence and vindictive rage and the quarter from which have issued the orders for the conflagrations which have by the Enemy been lighted up in these United States. America would have the Monarch see, that when provoked she can light up fires even at his own Doors. And in this Business it is requested, that you will use every possible Exertion. This Measure, in which so many Calamities are involved, and so contrary to the known and acknowledged Humanity with which Congress have heretofore carried on the present war, has, at length become, for the sole and direct purpose of self preservation, absolutely and indispensibly necessary, from the cruel and unprecedented Manner in which our Enemies are daily carrying on the present War. Our Villages on the Sea Coasts are numerous, most of them defenceless, and all of them, with very few Exceptions, exposed and easily accessable to a naval Force, which renders them at any Time a prey to a savage and desolating Enemy. The Towns of (3) heretofore laid in ashes, and the late successful attempts in burning and destroyed [sic] the Villages of Fairfield, Norwalk and Bedford in Connecticut and New-York, and the unquestionable proofs Congress have received, that the Vengence denounced against these States in the Manifesto of the British Commissioners will be executed in its fullest extent, has induced them, as the only effectual Means, to put a stop to the further destruction of our Country, to retaliate upon our Enemy by destroying, if possible, some of the most distinguished Cities in Great Britain and the West Indies. Our Countrymen have long complained of the slow and forbearing disposition of Congress, when every day announces to them the destruction of some part of their Country. To meet these Ideas, they have at length solemnly determined to revenge themselves on their Enemies, and to leave untried no exertions for carrying into execution their Manifesto of the 30 of Octr., 1778. A few desperate determined (4) Men, under the promise of handsome rewards, and well acquainted with the Situation of the large Towns in England & Scotland, will perhaps be the best instruments that can be employed for the Accomplishment of this Work. We do not however wish to point out any Mode that shall be obligatory upon you; your own Judgment and observation will readily suggest to you such Steps as are most likely to answer the Ends proposed.   As the avowed Determination of the Enemy, as set forth by the British Commissioners, is to render us of as little use as possible to our ally, perhaps it would not be improper, if Capt. Jones should be in France, and his own force is inadequate, to request further aid, and attempt the destruction of some of their Towns by a naval (5) surprlse. How such a Measure will accord with the Sentiments of the Court of France, your Situation will best enable you to determine. If it should appear to you improper to communicate the Matter at all to the Minister of France, you will then forbear to do it. We cannot conclude without once more earnestly pressing upon you. the Necessity of striking some blow similar to those suggested in the resolution of Congress. The destruction of a single village would instantly convince our Enemy of the Danger to which they are exposed, and the Necessity there will be, of desisting from the present destructive mode in carrying on the War ""

7573,dg013267,1779,William Whipple to Ebenezer Thompson,""" William Whipple to Ebenezer Thompson   My Dear Sir (1) Philadelphia the l9th July 1779 I wrote you by last post (2) that I had taken Mr Emersons effects out of the hands of Mr Stephenson.(3) I have since sent them forward by the waggon that conveyed the money to replace that taken out of circulation, & have taken the Officer of the Escorts receipt for the Chest, to deliver it at Exeter to Nicholas Gilman Esq, and shall herewith send you an Inventory of its contents, also Mr Stephensons accot together with a copy of the receipt I gave him, by which you'll find I have 655 dollars in my hands, if that sum can be taken out of the Treasury & charged to my accot it may be of immediate use to the Family besides saving the Risque & perhaps some expence of Conveyence. I find by a memorandum left by Mr Emerson that he had lent some money which I shall endeavor to collect, there is also something due from the Treasury, which it is necessary some person should be properly authorized to receive, in my Opinion it would be well to forward such powers as speedily as possible, in the mean time I shall endeavour to obtain the money by offering such security as is in my power, there are a few articles which I think are not worth transporting so great a distance, I shall therefore have them sold here, as noted in the Inventory. I filled up the Chest with a number of the journals of Congress which I mentioned in a letter to Col. Gilman,(4) these I suppose will be taken out at Exeter. I am informed the Cloaths have been washed and aired and as Mr Emerson died before the Pock filled, I cannot suppose there is any infection in them, however it may not be inconsistent with prudence for those who have not had that distemper to be cautious about handling them before they have another airing. You are undoubtedly informed of the scituation of our Military affairs in South Carolina to the 10th of June, & the paper which I  JULY 19, 1779  shall now inclose you will give you the last accots from that Country; to the same paper I must beg leave to refer you for all the accots we have receivd of the Glorious event that has lately taken place at Stony point; If we should be so successful as to dislodge the Enemy on the other side the River, Sir Harry's Ravaging Plans will be very much if not totally disconcerted, however we may expect he will execute them as far as is in his power, as they were formed in the Savage Council of Britain & being a favorite Project of that infernal Barbarian who we once called our King-And is it possible that there can be at this day, a single person who has the most distant desire of being under the Government of such an execrable Villain? Future Generations will not believe this part of our history much less will they believe that such wreched miscreants are permitted to remain among us. I should be happy to hear that the authority of NewHampshire were taking effectual measures to rid that State of all such miscreants, these People are Justly Chargeable with the greatest part of the misery of this cruel war, & still they are suffered to remain quietly among us, doing all the mischief in their power. The events of this Campaign will undoubtedly have great influence on next winters negociations, it is therefore of the utmost importance that we use every exertion in our Military operations to strengthen the nerves of, and give boldness to our negociator. Our latest advices from Paris are the 6th Apl.,(5) there is nothing contained in the dispatches of consequence, that I may communicate at present, I can only say our affairs wear a much better aspect in every other part of the world than in our own Country. Please to present my respects to my old Colleague Mr Frost, also to all the Gentn of Your Board at Exeter, and accept the best wishes of, Your affectionate Friend & Most Obed Sert, Wm Whipple ""

Hitherto, Sir, I have addressed you as a British Commissioner:(1) I now have the pleasure of writing a few lines to you as the British Commander in Chief. Accept them Sir Harry, they will celebrate your exploits. There is reason to think, that your defeat and subsequent inactivity the last summer, were to be contrasted by your victories and activity in the present campaign. Your predecessor, Sir William Howe, gave notice to his superior of his intended forward movement to White-Marsh: And, it is probable that you have observed the same line of conduct respecting your enterprize up the North-River. Sir William marched to crush General Washington: You advanced-but what was your object? Was it Fort Arnold at West Point-was it the small Fort La Fayette and Stoney Point-was it to take an actual survey of the North River-what was it? We know, that Sir William  JULY 21, 1779  returned re infecta. General Wayne writes in the Caesarian stile, and I will not anticipate his account of the conclusion of your enterprize. But, what was your object? Great were your preparations. They were of a secret complexion. They were made at your leisure. NorthRiver at length beheld you in all your might. You appeared like a Colossus striding from New York to Albany. You seemed to threaten, that at a blow, you would divide the United States of America. What would not have been your honors and your rewards, Sir Harry, had you in executing this threat done that, which Sir William Howe, with a much superior force, had not dared to attempt! In the plenitude of your power, you advanced up the North River. La Fayette had the boldness to obtrude upon your attention. Indignant-you revenged the affront: Yet, this was not the work of a moment. After the exertion of your power by land and water, during a day and an half, at the head of the British forces, you, Sir Henry Clinton, found it expedient to grant an honorable capitulation to a garrison of fifty men! Here you planted the British colours; and on the opposite shore, with eight hundred fatigue men, for weeks you laboured to render Stoney Point impregnable. In idea, you already curbed the haughty States of America; and, you sat down in your tent to announce your conquest to your sovereign. But, Sir Harry, how incautiously did you pen your triumphal dispatch! Victory urged-she was a new attendant-a favourite; and she maliciously prompted a conduct, to give pangs to your master, and lustre to the American arms. I think I see the court of St. James's devouring the contents of your dispatch. \""The attack upon La Fayette-the cool valour of his Majesty's officers in the army and navy-the ardour of the troops and seamen-the strength of the works taken-the commanding situation of Stoney-Point-and the endless train of advantages to yourself, and of difficulties to us, from your possession of it.\"" The monarch is in an extacy of joy! His ministers congratulate each other, as if rescued from Tower-Hill. The royal appartments resound with \""Clinton!\""-\""Sir Harry!\""-\""North River!\""-\""communication cut off!\"" -\""eastern provinces surrounded!\""-\""starving\""-\""submitting to the anticipated prowess and vigour of Sir George Collier and General Tryon!\""-with one voice, all the ministers celebrate thy name, O! Sir Harry Clinton! the sword, the spear of Britania!-the bells ring appeal-bonfires glare-conduits run-shouts rend the air-and rockets fly up and decorate the heavens with new stars in honor of Sir Harry Clinton! But, how transient is thy glory! Already it is in the wane. Hark! a thunder from Stoney Point! See! The gallant Wayne in silence and by starlight marching up to the mouths of your roaring cannon! Without the discharge of a single musket, he mounts your laboured ramparts-\""what!\"" and with twelve hundred American troops in a  moment captures five hundred British veterans-their works, their cannon, arms, stores, baggage-their honor! It is Wayne's re-surprize. The American troops feel their own force; and your's, Sir Harry, feel and acknowledge it. In this stage of the campaign, these sensations do not tend to enable you to send laureled messengers to White Hall. As brilliant as was the joy in the British court upon the news of your conquest and establishment at Stoney-Point; so gloomy will be their sorrow, upon the news of your ruin in that quarter. Your labours and your glories since the commencement of the campaign in the latter end of May to the 16th July, are overturned and destroyed by starlight in a single hour! Can you bear this reverse, Sir Harry! What will you say of your troops and your discipline! What must you say of our troops and our discipline! With the British army and navy under your orders, on the second of June, after an attack of a day and an half, you captured a small fort and fifty men on the east side of North-River. With twelve hundred Americans, on the 16th of July at 2 o'clock in the morning, without firing gun, and within an hour, General Wayne stormed and carried five hundred of your men in a regular fortification in an almost inaccessible situation, on the opposite shore of the river. The banks of NorthRiver contrast, the atchievements and the glories of a Clinton and a Wayne. America with pleasure and confidence sees, and Europe with astonishment and expectation will hear, that 1200 Americans with the loss of only four men, have rendered vain seven weeks operations by the grand army of Britain: And, have reduced them to the necessity of recommencing, in the middle of the campaign, their operations for the summer; and to labour with reduced numbers, and a lost reputation. Certainly, Sir Harry, you most sensibly must feel an aukwardness in continuing the language and appearance of conquering the United States of America. Is it possible that Sir George Collier and Major General Tryon can read their threatening address of the 4th of July to the inhabitants of Connecticut,(2) and not sink within themselves! General Burgoyne's proclamation,(3) even at that time of day, was thought a very extraordinary performance, altho' it was made at the head of a powerful army, but too likely to give it full effect. The just ridicule universally thrown upon it, and its fate, might have served as lessons to future military composers. But it is for Sir George Collier, and General Tryon, at the head of a few armed vessels, and a few hundred troops, and in a situation of our affairs far more, and of theirs far less prosperous than they were in summer 1777, to publish a more extravagant address than that by General Burgoyne. Let them enjoy their address, their conflagrations, their cruelties and their murders, not in the least tending to terminate the war, or even their predatory incursions in their favour. Let them glory in leading troops so totally abandoned, as that, when having set fire to   the Meeting House and Episcopal Church of Norwalk, they called aloud \""now God Almighty come and defend your own house!\"" and do you also, illustrious Sir Henry Clinton, do you glory in being the commander in chief of such officers and such troops, under your orders outraging every principle of decency and humanity! MS not found; reprinted from the Pennsylvania Packet, July 22, 1779. 1 For the letters Drayton had previously \""addressed\"" to Clinton \""as a British Commissioner,\"" see these Letters, 10:121n.1. 2 The \""threatening address\"" by George Collier and William Tryon probably appeared in a variety of formats and places.

The Weather here to this day is cool and uncommonly pleasant; and I cannot say that I have been incommoded by the Climate. You may be assured that I shall not expose myself, nor continue here one hour longer than indispensible duty requires. Some Matters of great Importance are drawing to a Conclusion: to leave them suspended I cannot Answer to myself nor my Constituents. When they are finished I shall return and meet my Friends with Confidence And a Conviction that I have faithfully done My Duty and that I have obtaind a Title to future Indulgence if not to the Esteem of my Country. I highly approve of your placing our Son at School: especially so near to you that you may visit him every week and hear from him almost daily. It has taken a great weight from my spirits as it is time he shoud improve. The Governeur wrote me that the Legislature woud meet the 1st of August (1)-so that I presume Brother Welles is mistaken whether they do or do not. I am very certain the publick good requires that they should as the Credit of our money depends on the Vigorous Exertions of the States. I congratulate you on the Success of General Wayne. It is a brilliant Maneuvre which will do great Honour to the American Arms. We long impatiently to hear of General Washington's further Operations. If we should succeed as well on the East side; & reoccupy King's Ferry it will be as advantageous as honorable. We hear, with Horror, of the Devastation committed by Governor Tryon in Connecticut. While it will tarnish the Glory of the British Nation and JULY 21, 1779  render them odious to All Europe: the miserable Instruments in this Tragedy will be execrated & detested. In a political View it will have an Effect directly Contrary to what is intended. Americans can never be worked to Submission by Cruelty and Devastation. Their Aversion to these Destroyers will become deeper rivetted: and their Efforts to defend themselves more Strenuous and decisive. I flatter myself we shall have a glorious Campaign in every Quarter And that the Almighty Being who has hitherto so manifestly protected us will soon bring this War to a Safe & honourable Conclusion. With usual Compliments & Blessings to our Parents, Friends, & Children-I remain my dearest Polly your ever faithful & affect. Jas. Duane ""

7588,dg013282,1779,John Dickinson s Draft Petition,"""John Dickinson's Draft Petition   [July 22? 1779] (1) The undersigned on Behalf of the States they respectively represent,(2) object to and protest against the foregoing Resolution (3) for the following Reasons- First-because, the vesting a single State (and perhaps a single person) with an absolute power directly for the purpose of prohibiting these States from all Commerce with a great Kingdom, tho the Settlement thereof may be obtained on Terms that may by them be judged just & reasonable, and may in Reality be exceedingly advantageous to all these States, is inconsistent with the principles of the Union. Secondly-because, Great Britain may agree effectually to assure to these States the Fisheries intended in the Resolution, but may utterly refuse to insert the prescribed Form of such a Stipulation as it contains, in a Treaty; and such an Assurance, if the Stipulation cannot be obtained, ought to be accepted by these States-or, if such an Assurance cannot be obtained from Great Britain, but may be obtained from the Ally of those States, the same ought to be accepted, rather that the Treaty of Peace or of Commerce with Great Britain should be wholly broken off. Thirdly-because, the Resolution has a Tendency to create Discords among these States, by exciting Apprehensions, that the essential Interests of a great Majority may be sacrifisk to an arbitrary Form assumed by an over-anxious Attention to a point more peculiarly interesting to a few. Fourthly-because, the insisting on the Submission of Great Britain to this Form may occasion a Continuance of the War, as She may refuse to conclude a Treaty of Peace which is to procure her no Benefit from the Commerce of these States, unless she shall assent to so humiliating a Mode of proceeding. Fifthly-because, it being uncertain whether Great Britain may not act, and very probable that she will act in the Manner mentioned in the next preceding Clause, Delegates are not warrantable in committing their Country to further Distresses and Calamities for the Attainment of a Submission to that Form. Sixthly-because, if Great Britain shall act in the Manner supposed, the Ally of these States, and the power whose Mediation is expected, may impute the Continuance of the War to a dictatorial Haughtiness in those States, and may be highly disgusted-A Consideration strongly enforced by the Communications of the Minister of France.(4) Seventhly-because, such a Tone in negotiating is not suited to the Circumstances of Republics rising under so many Difficulties to take their Station among established Sovereign powers, the most and greatest of which are Monarchies, and may cause in them JULY 22, 1779  prejudices against the Dispositions and Views of these States extremely injurious to their Characters and Wellfare.

7589,dg013283,1779,John Dickinson s Speech,"""John Dickinson's Speech   Mr. President, July 22d. 1779 (1) Having very deliberately considered the Treaties between his most Christian Majesty and The United States-the Memorials of the Minister Plenipotentiary of France of February 9th 1779, March 17th, March 30th, May 3d, May 8th, May 9th, May 22d, & May 27th, following, his Communications in Conference on the 15th of February aforesaid, and on the 12th of this Month-the little Progress yet made by Congress towards a Completion of the Business therein mentioned-the Importance of that Business-the Danger of Delay-the situation of foreign and domestic Affairs-the Conduct of other Nations in vindicating their Independance and Rights-the Distance of these States from Europe-and the Manner in which the Deliberations of Congress on the said Memorials and Communications have been conducted, I esteem it my indispensable Duty to propose another Mode of proceeding thereon for facilitating and accelerating those Deliberations, a Mode, in my humble Opinion, by its Nature more adapted to the Exigencies of Negotiation, and in  JULY 22, 1779  which, at the same Time, every proposition, Question or Difficulty that can be thought of by Us, may in a regular Disposition receive its fit Arrangement, due Consideration, and proper Qualifications. These purposes, it is apprehended, will be most speedily and effectually attained by throwing our Resolutions into the Form of a sett of Instructions to the Minister plenipotentiary who shall be appointed on our part to carry on the Negotiation in Conjunction with the Minister or Ministers of our Ally, under the Mediation of his most Catholic Majesty. I have assayed a Form of this kind, in which I have endeavoured to trace the Turns that may take place in the Course of the Negotiation. I have not the Presumption to think it compleat: but as it will be sufficient to convey to Congress an Idea of the Plan, their Wisdom, if it is approv'd, can easily supply its Deficiencies. On the other Hand, it is very likely, that, to guard against Embarrassments that may arise from illimitable Contingencies, some Stages are mark'd at which the Negotiation may never arrive, and some Questions and Difficulties stated, that may not be therein mentioned. For these, it is hoped, that the Remoteness of the place intended for treating, and the pointed Expressions of the Minister of France on the subject, will be allowed as Excuses. If they occur, your Minister will be instructed on them. If they do not occur; they will be at worst, but useless. Sir, It will appear from these papers, which I propose to deliver into your Hands,(2) that I would give my Vote for a Pacification, if it cannot possibly be more advantageously obtained, upon Terms that with some Members of this House will be inadmissible. In so momentous an Affair, I should tremble to think of trusting to my own Judgement, in Contradiction to that of persons whose Characters give so much Weight to their sentiments. I do not trust to it. I find the Ideas I venture to express, approved by Gentlemen of distinguished Abilities and Integrity; and I have the Satisfaction of knowing that my Principles of Conduct in this Business can be justified with a most remarkable application by the Examples of those great Statesmen and excellent Patriots whose Prudence and Virtue unbiass'd by plausible pretensions and undaunted by threatening Opposition, established the Freedom, Sovereignty and Independance of the united provinces of the Low Countries. Yet-these Authorities great as they are, have not detach'd Me so far from a deferential Regard for the Opinion of those who differ from Me, as perhaps future Events may prove I ought to have been, if I could more effectually have resisted the Influencies of a Regard so extensive. But-a just Attention to what concerns Myself, renders it necessary not to confine my Observations to the following Form of Instructions, because-it contains not all the Measures in which I will most heartily join, for assuring as far as We can to these States the important  Fisheries of North America. On this Head, besides what is mentioned in the following Form, I cheerfully assent to these Resolutions. 1st. That no Article shall be inserted in the expected Treaty, by which the Right of all these States or the Exercise thereof by any of these States to take Fish on the Banks of Newfoundland and on other the fishing Banks and in the Seas of North America, excepting as in the following Resolution is excepted, shall be given up or in any Manner impair'd. 21y. That the Faith of the United States be mutually pledged by and to each other, that, the treaties of Paris in 1778 being all ways preserv'd inviolate, in Case Great Britain shall after the Conclusion of the War disturb the Inhabitants of any of these States in the Exercise of the said Fisheries any where excepting within three Leagues of the Coasts of the Territories that shall remain to Great Britain at the said Conclusion, or such Distance as shall be established in the expected Treaty & approv'd by these States, the other States shall, if required by the State so disturbed, regard such Disturbance as an Act of open Hostility against all the States, and shall make Common Cause in support, Maintenance and Defence of their Right to the said Fisheries. It has not been thought necessary to lengthen the following Form by dilating on those Articles that are usual in Treaties; or such as are of less Importance; nor on the Determinations to be taken concerning Spain, upon the Representations of the Minister of France respecting a Connection to be made with that Kingdom, because, it is apprehended, that these Subjects of Deliberation will not occasion much Delay. Sir, I am perfectly aware of the Reproaches I shall incur, and of the Hazards I shall run, by committing Myself in a Manner so contradictory as I now do to the Sense of great Numbers of my Countrymen more ardent tho not more zealous than Myself in our righteous Cause. An Attack upon Me is already begun, in consequence of what past some days ago relative to these points. But-I should be unworthy of a Seat in Our Honorable Assembly, if Reproaches and Hazards of any kind could divert or deterr Me from executing the high Office conferr'd upon Me by my confiding Constituents, in that Manner, which according to the best Judgement I can frame on a View of all Circumstances and the most mature Deliberation of which I am capable, I think most likely to promote their Wellfare. Two Rules I have laid down for Myself throughout this Contest, to which I have constantly adhered, and still design to adhere. First-on all occasions where I am call'd upon as a Trustee for my Countrymen to deliberate on Questions important to their Happiness, disdaining all personel advantages to be deriv'd from a Suppression of my real Sentiments, and defying all Dangers to be risqued by a Declaration   of them, openly to avow them; and secondly-after thus discharging this Duty, whenever the public Resolutions are taken, to regard them the opposite to my Opinion as sacred because they lead to public Measures in which the Common Weal must be interested, and to join in supporting them as earnestly as if my Voice had been given for them. While I believe in my Conscience that I am faithfully serving my Country, I shall deplore but not dread her Resentment if I happen to offend her. She is my Parent-as a dutiful Son, I shall kiss her correcting Rod. Let her strike-but let her also hear Me. If the present Day is too warm for Me to be calmly judg'd, I can credit my Country for Justice some Years hence. Tis true, I may be mistaken- but sufficient it will be for my Vindication, if it be decided, that my Conduct is influenc'd by what I think right-for then it must be influenc'd by Honesty and Affection. Whatever may be the Merit or Demerit of my Behaviour on this great Occasion, I beg, that these papers signed by Me, may be receiv'd by Congress, and kept among their Records, that I may not be injured by Misapprehensions, nor have it in my power to elude a Charge, but, may stand or fall by Evidence under my own Hand voluntarily delivered by Me at the Time of the Transaction.

The design of the late Resolution for borrowing twenty Million was to put the lender in Such Circumstances as to Secure the real value of his money both principal & Interest in any given circumstances in future, it is founded in this principal that the value of the bills will not depreciate if the quantity in circulation is not increased, & the lender is at Liberty to keep his money in the fund & not receive the principal whenever the quantity in circulation is greater than it was at the time he put the money in & his Anual Interest is to Increase in the nominal Sum in proportion as the Sum in Circulation is Increased Since the time he put his money into loan, if Such case should happen. The plan of this Resolution is So much approved that in One day in this City half a Million was Subscribed.

It is peculiarly unfortunate for the People and for Congress that Subjects of JULY 22, 1779  this Sort should be thus publickly agitated. Without divulging the Secrets of Congress it is not practicable to place the Subject in its proper Light and yet unless that is done the People will probably be deluded and if it is done Congress must become contemptible abroad and consequently insignificant at Home.

7602,dg013296,1779,Gouverneur Morris to Thomas Paine,"""Gouverneur Morris to Thomas Paine   July 24? 1779] For the PENNSYLVANIA EVENING POST. The galled horse winces. Thomas, you seem to be in a passion.(1) Has Cato ruffled the smooth surface of your temper? Who could suppose that you would be wounded by such weapons? But truth is powerful. You charge Cato with being a Iying incendiary scoundrel. Cato laughs at your rage. Why don't you answer the queries? Being abusive won't serve your turn; for the public expect answers; aye, and satisfactory answers too. Cato asked you questions, and he asked questions also of one whose abilities and perseverance have acquired the respect of his enemies, and the confidence of his friends. That gentleman had a right to expect that he should not have been coupled in the same paper with you; for though this may have done you honor, it could do him none. He would not have been questioned, if his zeal had not JULY 24, 1779  been excited by misrepresentations, and if that ill directed zeal had not been misrepresented. Cato is not infallible; but he is not a fool, nor does he speak from prejudice or malevolence. That gentleman has answered the queries by his silence, he was probed, but he did not flinch. Had you been untouched, you also would have been silent, or if you did speak, you would have answered not by calumny but by argument. You have attacked many innocent men, and they have given candid answers to your foul charges; or treated you and your charges with equal contempt. These are marks of innocence. Why could you not profit by their example? But truth is powerful. You affect to believe that nothing in Cato's performance will be credited to your injury, but you shew all the horrors of your own feelings, and disburthen your tortured spirit in the reproachful exclamations of a convict. You say, \""I can but consider myself, and I know I am considered both by friends and enemies, as a principal means in rescuing this country from imposition and a dangerous species of monopolizing.\""(2) That you yourself believe this is possible, because it is possible that you have a greater defect of understanding than of integrity. What your friends believe, it is needless to enquire; for how far you may have duped them, or how far others may have duped you, is alike indifferent. As to enemies, you may soon convince yourself that you have as few as any man living; for upon the closest scrutiny, you will hardly find one quality, either of your heart or your understanding, which, exerted to the utmost would raise a higher emotion than contempt. You cannot divert the public attention by bringing again before them the threadbare unsupported story of congressional monopolizers. It is as much beneath the public candor to credit these idle tales, as it is beneath the dignity of the public servants to confute them. We know whence they took their origin, and how you gleaned them up, the precious crums which fellfrom the rich man's table. We know the industry used to collect evidence in support of them, and the futile ridiculous ground on which those persons stand, who make such charges. We know too the source of the Virginia law, and how the plan was laid for it in Philadelphia, to be revenged on one who would not sacrifice his honor and conscience to support the family compact. You indeed may not be acquainted with these things, for your employers know you too well to trust you. Thus you stand forth a happy instance to shew, how a man may avoid a full participation in sin by being a notorious sinner. Do you think it possible for any one who knows you to read without laughter the last paragraph of your manifesto.(3) Shall I transcribe it? Yes-and you will hardly charge me with slandering you when I say it is yours; for you have signed your name to it. And you will hardly charge me with slandering you when I say (what you yourself   have said) that you are author of all the writings under the signature of Common Sense. And the world will not charge me with slandering you when I say, that writings more abusive than those, and a character less fair than that of their author, are not to be found in the circle of existence. Yes, Thomas, it is your sweet self which says, \""if men under the hope of being concealed by a printer are to publish what they dare not own, the public will for ever be held in confusion. British emissaries, British prisoners, and disaffected refugees will embarrass every measure, and endeavor to defame every character, however fair, that stands in their way.\"" From thy own mouth will I condemn thee. Hast thou not endeavored to embarrass every measure, and to defame every character that stood in the way of the enemy? In the way of those who labored in the service of the enemy? In the way of conciliation with Britain? Base conciliation on the odious terms of submission and through the vile channel of low emissaries! Spies! Spies! highly recommended indeed and patronized by those whom this country had unwarily trusted. Have not you embarrassed every measure, and defamed every character that stood in the way of a junto, who have endeavored to subject all things to themselves, all power civil, military, and marine? Who have endeavored to remove every person that would not mingle in their factious views; and to place none in office but their friends, relatives and dependents, against whose malevolence the unsullied fame of the great American patriot was but a slender barrier; whose victim was a W*********-and whose idol a L**?(4) Have you not, against the stubborn conviction of your own soul, supported, defended, and extolled this factious junto? Fie on't! Oh, fie! But you would insinuate that Cato is some British emissary; because he defames the character however fair of the great, the glorious, magnificent, magnanimous, most monstrous Tom. Had Cato been a British emissary, you would not have needed to ask his name. He would early have been announced to you. Aye and full early would you have found that Cato was a very civil man. As civil a man perhaps as doctor Berkenhout.(5) You upon your floor of office was master of every secret, you are not to learn therefore that this doctor Berkenhout, however, protected and supported, and however his errand was excused upon the flimsy pretence of philosophical researches; and however civil he may have been to you, was nevertheless a spy from Britain; or if you like the term better, a British emissary. Tell us, since you have so excellent a knack of telling the truth, while you keep the secret, a thing not very difficult for those characters, who are not believed, even when they speak the truth. Tell us, I say, the truth and keep the secret of what passed between doctor Berkenhout and your friends, not yourself, for no man is bound to become a self accuser. Tell the truth and keep the secret of what passed between mr. Temple and your friends. And since you know so well, and have so often  entertained the world with the supposed debates of a certain assembly, tell the truth, but carefully, yea most carefully conceal the secret, how and by whom their emissaries were defended within doors. These are secrets which must soon be known, these are truths which you tremble at. And is it for you to ask the name of a publisher? Go, wretch, hide thy pitiful head in oblivion. Crawl not from thy den but with boding bats and the night owl; and when thou presents thyself unto the gazing moon, shew her a spectacle of horror. To the whips, the stings, the scorpions of guilt, I leave thee. To despair, to shame, to the anguish of contempt, I leave thee. May the balm of repentance sooth thy agonizing soul. Mayest thou soon be forgiven, as thou must soon be forgotten; and when disease and poverty shall overtake thee, and when thou in vain solicitest from thy present coadjutors the poor pittance of misery, mayest thou receive it from their hands whom thou has injured. CATO MS not found, reprinted from the Pennsylvania Evening Post, July 24, 1779. 1 Morris was responding to a letter published by Paine in the July 16 issue of the Pennsylvania Evening Post, which Paine had written in answer to a series of rhetorical questions posed by Morris (over the pseudonym \""Cato\"") in a letter printed in the Post on July 9. See Gouverneur Morris to Benjamin Towne, July 9, 1779. \""If men,\"" Paine had challenged in reply, \""under the hope of being concealed by a printer, are to publish what they dare not own, the public will for ever be held in confusion. British emissaries, British prisoners, and disaffected refugees, will embarrass every measure, and endeavor to defame every character, however fair, that stands in their way; and for this reason, were it for no other, I conceive that the name of no writer, in the present state of things, ought to be concealed when demanded.\"" Paine, Writings (Foner), 2:169-71. Although the rhetoric of the participants sometimes obscures the issues at stake in these public exchanges, it is useful to recall that Morris had originally taken up pen against Paine to deny the accusation that he was the author of the \""Americanus\"" essays that had recently appeared in the Philadelphia press attacking American claims to the northern fisheries. For another public attack on Paine during this period, by North Carolina delegate Thomas Burke writing in general defense of Silas Deane and his congressional friends, see also Thomas Burke's Epistle, July 16, 1779. 2 And Paine had continued: \""for what can be more dangerous to her commerce and her honor that members of congress forming trading companies, in partnership with their ambassadors. The state of Virginia, on discovering that three of their delegates were partners in this company, not only appointed others in their room, but have passed a law to prevent such practices in future; and I hope every state will, in some line or other, do the same.\"" For further information on Virginia's action, see Meriwether Smith to Thomas Jefferson, June 25 and July 6, 1779, note 1. 3 The paragraph quoted in note one above. 4 That is, a Washington and a Lee. 5 For information on Dr. John Berkenhout's relations with Arthur and Richard Henry Lee, see these Letters, 10:528.

As the Commercial business is entirely out of the line of the Navy Board they think it improper that Such accounts Should be settled by that Board, besides they are not authorised to give any Such instructions. They tell me they have long ago given directions that the prize goods which are not wanted for the public use Should be Sold-however as I have been very particular with them, I suppose they will write you fully on the Several Subjects.(1) As to the copper and Saddlery, I suppose you must have rec'd instructions from the Board of War respecting them before this time. The last accounts from South Carolina were under 23d June-our prospects were then flattering-perhaps another week may produce agreeable intelligence from that quarter, but I hope there will be no public rejoicing till the intelligence comes from Such authority as will justify the fullest belief. You say you have no objection to a \""Republican Govt.,\"" but your proviso destroys evey principle of Republicanism. I agree with you that virtue Should be encouraged, and vice restrained, but perhaps we should differ very widely as to the mode, as well as the objects- however as I have neither leisure nor inclination at present to enter into the merits of this Subject, in the epistolary way, I believe it will be as well to defer it to Some future day, when we may have a tete a tete conversation on this and many other matters-in the mean time be assured that I am with true republican zeal and the most perfect Sincerity, your very affectionate friend &c, Wm. Whipple P. S. The enclosed papers will give you the particulars of our Success in Hudson's river. General Wayne has gained immortal honors by this enterprise which is by far the most brilliant of any thing of the kind that has happened this war. Perhaps History will produce very few instances equal to it. I observe one of the accounts Say General Wayne had 1200 men, but I understand from better authority that his number did not rise to 1000.

I hope the change of Air and proper exercise will in some measure restore it, I have attended Congress some days and am not well pleased at the present mode of doing business, however as we lack much of Stoping the press & thereby put an end to further Emissions which I Ardently wish I hope something will be done to give our Sinking money a little more Credit, it might be done if we could agree on the Mode. I think we might have had Peace if our Eastern friends had not been too Sanguine in their demands respecting the Fishery but here I am not at liberty to put so much on paper as I could wish. I can only say the preparations necessary to obtain that desirable event go on too Slowly. We have no particular News but what is contained in the enclosed papers. The manner in which the Strong Fortress at Stony Point was taken from the enemy is considered as the highest perfection of Military decepline and reflects great honor on our Officers & Soldiers. Lieutenant Gibbons who commanded a forlorn hope of twenty Men had Seventeen of them killed & wounded and yet he entered the Fort among the foremost.

General Clinton is now up the North River with his whole Army having left a very small Garrison in New York, it is imagined he intends to make an Attack on our Fort at West Point, if so, I have no doubt it will be defended with great obstinacy and the contest will be Attended with great Slaughter.

Thornton was seduced away by the Contrivances of a Junto who were thus also revenged upon him for having given Intelligence against Docr. Bancroft. Deane owns he got his Recall the 4th of March yet he imposed himself on the public so as to be presented on the 20th. He disposed of public Money to others and took largely of it himself.

Arthur Lee shall continue to be possessed of all the Powers heretofore given him as a Commissioner at the Court of France so long as he shall remain in & be present at the sd. Court.\"" This wise & oeconomical Measure of Congress excited infinitely Mr. Deane's Spleen because either in his misconception or misrepresentation it showed an extraordinary Confidence in the Man he hated & whose Ruin he meditated. Mr. D____ published on the 5th of Decr. 1778 on the 14th of Sepr. preceding Doctr. Franklin had been chosen Minister plenipotentiary here and consequently I was no more a \""Commissr. of the Ct. of Versailles\"". Was Mr. Deane in Philadelphia ignorant of this? He asserted that on the 5th of Decr which he knew to be untrue; and this with the worst & basest of all purposes-the imposing upon the People to induce them to censure Congress & myself unjustly. Mr. D____informs the Public that unfortunately for them I gave universal disgust to the nation whose Assistance we solicited. He had taken the Business of the Comrs. so much to himself that not one in a million knew that I was a Commissioner; not one in a hundred of the Letters from the differt. pts. of the Kingdm. bore my Name. See  the Fact & the Reason from Messrs. Delaps of Bourdeau. Janry. 3d. 1778. \""We wrote several letters addressed to your direction to which we received answers only from Messrs.

7614,dg013308,1779,Edmund Randolph to Thomas Jefferson,"""Edmund Randolph to Thomas Jefferson   Dear Sir Phila. July 27. 1779. The annals of the war, tho' perhaps they may contain a more important, will not transmit to posterity a more brilliant action, than the reduction of Stony point, which was effected on the 15th Instant under the command of General Wayne. The fort, scarcely more accessible by nature than Quebec itself, was rendered more difficult of approach by abbatis, and other military obstructions. If the ardor of the assailants could have been damped by human means, the deep morass and strong works in front and flank, which they had to pass and subdue, would have furnished a reasonable excuse. But volunteers alone being admitted into this dangerous Enterprize, they marched up with firmness in the face of a galling fire of Musquetry  JULY 27, 1779  and a twenty four pounder, loaded with grape shot. The Business was done by the bayonet only: for altho' the party, which was sent to amuse the garrison, was directed to keep up an incessant fire, the two columns, to whom the real attack was assigned, mastered the works without a single discharge of their pieces. What could veterans do more, than to put their whole confidance in cold Steel? Indeed the van consisted of 150, who advanced with unloaded musquets. The wounded on the Side of America are one Lt. Col., two Capts., three Lieuts., ten Sergts., three corporals, and sixty four privates; the killed two Sergts, & thirteen privates. The killed of the Enemy are 63, the wounded 43, and about 441 privates besides were taken, together with several Officers. The Stores, I believe, are considerable; and are ordered to be appraised, with a view of complying with Gen. Washington's Engagement, that they should be distributed among the Soldiers, if successful. The post greatly annoyed our army, but requiring too large a number of men to hold it, has been destroyed. I am, Dr. Sir, with great Regard, yr. obliged humble Servt, Edm. Randolph [P. S. ] You will oblige me much, by suggesting to me such reflections, as occur to you on the subject of peace: not on the propriety of making it, if possible, but on the terms, necessary for America to insist on.

7615,dg013309,1779,William Whipple to Josiah Bartlett,"""William Whipple to Josiah Bartlett   My Dear Sir Philadelphia 27th July 1779 Your favor of the 10th inst is now before me.(1) Looking over my minutes I find I have wrote you several times since the 27th May and that I have punctually discharged my debts in that way, as to numbers.(2) You seem to be somewhat alarmed at the New-York & Newport publications which are circulated by the Tories and Suspicious Charecters. I am very sorry you have any such left among you, I think it high time they were all Hung, or Banished. The reports, of France seeking for peace under the mediation of Spain is without the least foundation, the reverse is the fact, England has applied to Spain for her mediation which has been peremptorily refused on any terms short of her acknowledgemt of our independence by Britain. The last accots from Paris was under the 6th Apl, there then appeared the strongest attachment to us & you may be assured our cause is extreemly Popular throughout Europe. As to other alliances, they are undoubtedly attainable & I am very sorry that the fault shod lay where it does, that we have not formed an alliance with Spain long ago, delays which all produced by personal prejudices is JULY 27, 1779  the only cause of Spains not being fully engaged in the war long ago; however I f[l]atter myself those causes are in a great measure removed and our affairs will go on more smoothly than they have for some time past. You know we have had great assistance from Spain, her succors are still continued & there is not the most distant reason to think they will be withdrawn, but every reason to think the contrary. Be comforted my Friend, suffer not Idle reproches to intimidate. Remember our cause is more just than the posterity of Jacob was ever engaged in, yet we are told miracles were wrought in favor of that people, notwithstanding which, it seems there own exertions were always essential for their security, let us exert our selves, as we ought & no doubt Heaven will smile on our endeavors and crown them with success. I fear we place too much dependence on foreign alliances, which will tend to introduce a servility distructive to true Republicanism. We must expect all nations will be influenced by their own interest and so far we may expect the Friendships of any power that inclines to form an alliance with us, but if we expect more, we shall certainly be disappointed-it requires no great depth in Politics to decern that the alliance already entered into is as much for the interest of our ally as ourselves & there is every appearence of an increasing benifit on her part; it is not in the power of Great Britain to offer her any adequate compensation for a surrender of those advantages, there therefore can be no danger from that quarter. Spain has gone so far that she cannot with the least degree of Honor retract, besides if we consider the abuses she received from Britain the last war & her National Character we need not apprehend an apostasy there. Holland stands ready to resent in her way, the insults offer'd her Flagg, almost every Court in Europe think favorably of our Cause, there certainly then can be no cause for despondency, we have nothing to fear but ourselves & such fear wod be immediately discipated if we had vigour enough to get rid of our internal Enemies. The inclosed papers will give you particulars of Genl Wayne's enterprise, a more Briliant action (all things considerd) is not to be met with in History-the prisoners are on the way to this City. I am very sincerly Yours, W. Whipple [P. S.] I believe I gave you my Opinion of the Vermont negociations in my last.(3) ""

In addition to the lines which I troubled you with the day before yesterday (1) by Colonel, or should I say, Doctor McHenry, he is an honest Man, with either, or without any Title, permit me to inform you-I presented to Congress this Morning, Colo. Fleury's earnest request for the Flag which he had the glory of lowering at Stony point,(2) but there was not a single voice heard in second to my motion, in truth I had spoken to several of the Members on the subject before the meeting of Congress, these discovered not only no inclination, but rather an aversion to parting with so high a testimony of a great & brilliant victory, nevertheless I determined to fulfill my promise, you see the success. Fancy often fills up the chasms made by disappointments of this kind; many of the most celebrated Italian originals in the Cabinets of curious fanciful Men in England, are good Copies. Suppose in the present instance the Colonel should order an accurate likeness of the first flag to be made & content himself with that, or that by a very trifling practice of ambidexterity he should exchange the Copy for the original, or suppose he should take a much better & less exceptionable method for accomplishing his wishes, that he should arm himself with one of JULY 29, 1779  Dunlap's Packets in which his gallant behavior & the particular feat of cutting the halliards stand upon record by Authority of Congress; this might be kept in the tin Case with Commissions & testimonials, answer every purpose of display, & save the trouble & expence of lugging 60 or 80 Yards of bunting round the Globe. I have executed my Commission, have added my best consolatory advice to a disappointed Client & trust the Colonel will do me the Justice to assure himself, my own opinion on the propriety of his suit was not disclosed fully or partially to any body before I had received a modest denial, by a profound silence. Nothing new from South Carolina, excepting a Delegate (3) who left Charles Town one day before the date of our late Letters.

7638,dg013332,1779,William Whipple to Josiah Bartlett,"""William Whipple to Josiah Bartlett   My Dear Sir Philadelphia 3d Augt 1779 I wrote you per last post when I believe I acknowledged the receipt of yours of the 10th of July.(1) I am sorry Mr. Secy. Thompson did not see the Committee of Congress at Vermont,(2) however I hope every measure will be taken to support N. Hampshires Claim to that Territory. N.Y. has been very quiet about that matter ever since the  AUGUST 3, 1779  return of the Committee but this Calm will not last long. You are too well acquainted with the arts & insidious designs of certain men to need their charecters from me. If the Claim of New Hampshire is not supported that Country will assuredly be annex'd to N.Y. which I am sure must be attended with disagreeable consequences not only to N.H. but other Eastern States. I intended to have wrote you largely on this subject but having been several times interrupted & my head crowded with a thousand other matters, I am under a necessity of defering it for the present. Our Accots. from the West Indies are by no means unpleasant, I will give them to you so far as my recollection serves me from hearing Mr Binghams Letter read which came to hand Yesterday.(3) Count De Estaing with 25 ships of the line & 11 Frigates sail'd from Martinico the 28th June for Granada. Admiral Byron being inform[ed] of the Capture of St Vincents on his arrival at St Lucia in the Evening of the 30th sail'd the 1st of July in the morning with 18 ships of the line & 3 Frigates in order to retake it being then ignorant of the Expedition against Granada. He appeard before St Vincent & demanded a surrender but a deputation of the principal inhabitants informing him of the Resolution of the Caribs to carry devastation through the Island if an attack should be made & beseeching him to leave them to their destiny, & at the same time he being inform'd of the critical scituation of Granada abandon'd his project & directed his Course for that Island, which it is not improbable might have surrendered before his arrival as the french fleet had four days start of him. Byron took 2000 Troops with him from St Lucia whos Baggage were on board the transport & were destined for this Continent. From these circumstances there is the highest probability that an action has happened indeed reports will have it so, but I hope I shall not incur the Charge of Infidelity for not giving into reports too readily, however I will agree with the miltitude so far as to allow that appearances are very favorable. Please to inform me whether the journals of Congress which I directed to Col. Gilman are come to hand; I shod also be glad to know if you ever received the \""Observations on the American Revolution\"" which I sent to you in Feby or March. I sent at the same time a number to be distributed but have never heard if any of them came to hand. I most Heartily wish your Penobscot Expedition may succeed nor can I see any thing against but the delays that have taken place in preparing which may give the Enemy opportunity to get reinforcements. Should it succeed I can see no difficulty in crossing the Bay immediately & taking possession of Nova Scotia, this would be so Glorious an acquisition that it wod surely be worth Hazarding much for. Pray let me know if such a plan is in contemplation. Col. Peabody informs me he has inclos'd the latest News papers.  By the conclusion of your last letter you seem to expect me home shortly; I have stay'd much longer than I intended, or perhaps than is desired by my Constituents. If the latter shod be the case a very short notice will be sufficient for my departure from this place. I am extreamly anxious for the determination of some important questions which ought to have been decided many months ago,(4) this & some other matters, which I shall communicate to you when I may have the pleasure of a tete-a-tete conversation, on some future day will accot for my continuing so long here; & since the summer is so far spent I think to take the pleasant part of Autumn to travel in unless it shod be otherwise ordered by the authority which placed me here & whos orders I shall always be happy in Obeying. I am my Dear Sir most Respectfully, Yours, Wm Whipple ""

I am very sorry for your disappointment, but doubt not you have had intelligence Since, that has in some measure made up for it. Our success at Stony Point has in some measure drawn the  AUGUST 4, 1779  attention of the enemy from the brutal ravages which they were carrying on with such rapidity in Connecticut-the prisoners arrived here a day, or two ago. Accounts from the West Indies are not disagreeable-the movements of Count D'Estaing has stopped 2000 men which were destined for the Continent. The Count's great superiority at Sea affords a flattering prospect of success should he come to action with Byron, the former having 25 ships of the line and 11 frigates, and the latter is said to have only 18 of the line and three frigates. It is probable you will have a particular account from the West Indies before this reaches you, I therefore will not trouble you with a Second hand Story. I have seen but 2 or 3 of the Magazines you mention and those were not worth reading therefore I have not taken them, but if you incline to take them they may be sent in the way you propose. I shall wait your further orders and wish to be informed if you chuse to have them from the first publication. The Penobscot expedition is of importance. I pray God it may succeed, but fear the great delays with which it has been attended, will give the enemy time to reinforce, if it should be Successful what is there to prevent crossing the Bay and taking possession of Nova Scotia for the honor of N.E.

Sir Philadelphia Aug. 6. 1779 Your favor of July 22d 1778,(1) forwarded from Nantes by Mr. Williams the 25th of February this Year, arrived not here till the 31st of July. I wonder the more that so very few of yr. letters reach Philada. in the Course of a Year as Mr. Dumas finds means to convey a series above the Numbers of the Alphabet in the same term of time, and is also in continual Correspondence wth. you. It is needless at this Season to take up the different Parts of your long letter, for which I feel myself, however, obliged to you: But, I cannot omit to notice that you are totally mistaken as to \""partial Objections\"" having been before Congress at the time of their dissent to the 11th & 12th articles. It is true that, since that period, much has been read from the Persons you suppose to have written on that subject.  AUGUST 6, 1779  You will long e'er now have seen the Use which has been made of my letter to you respecting Mr. Deane's Recall.(2) I at least made a Show of a Disposition to befriend him. I really had such a Disposition; and, early on his arrival, let him know what had grounded that Proceeding of Congress, in hope that he would not be driven by a false Jealousy, which he discovered, so as to suffer Wreck upon the Quick sands of Indiscretion. All my Aim was in vain; He has been borne headlong. His publication of Decr. 5th has, in my opinion, totally ruined his claims to any public trust on the ground of his Hability in Affairs. And, however you may not discover the great Malignity of his Innuendoes, you cannot but see & own that his Peice contains dow[n]right Lies which must be pointed out to the Public, who have not yet your good Grounds for Conviction. There is not a single Circumstance which is mentioned against Mr. Lee that is supported, except his not having the Confidence of the french Court. The Ministers must have been Angels of Light not to have conceived Prejudices in Consequence of the indefatigable Arts of one who thought himself saddled when a Colleague of Sense, Honor and Integrity was given to him by Congress. The Ministry were misled but, the Consequence does not follow that, therefore, Congress should destroy an able & faithful Servant. What slippery Ground would this make for our Ministers abroad? Will there not probably be ambitious Men always in Congress to trip them?

However, I shall think this Circumstance a fresh Call upon My Industry, a Quality wch. is an Object of the hatred of your Foes who have found themselves long ago mine in consequence.

A Man of War of that Size has been given up to the \""Direction\"" of John Paul Jones, and the Name has been changed to \""Poor Richard\"" that it may not appear to belong to the french Marine. Our Commissioners have moreover certified under their Hands to Jones that he is still in the American Navy, tho' he had quitted it some time ago for that of France, but did not give up his Commission. I formed my Conjectures upon first receiving that Intelligence, and your Anecdote confirms me therein so far as that I expect soon to hear of blazing Retaliation. And has not that very philosophic Politician (2) been yet to see you? I shall grow highly disgusted at my public Employment if its certain or even natural Tendency is to make me insensible of \""the thousand nameless Anxieties that distress the tender hearts of your Sex\"" or inattentive to a proper Call to exert myself in relieving them. My Letter (3) in answer to a former one of yours is before this in your Hand and will convince you that the dreaded Callosity has not yet fixed upon my Heart. I have therein attempted, nor ought it to be in vain on such grounds, to give your Bosom Ease by directing you to repose it on that Assemblage of Merit which originates and finishes your Husband's Conduct uniformly.

I wish I was where I could a viva voix give you the History of the Election of a Cloathier General: it was a curious Affair.(2) I pray God to put you upon some Concert with D'Estaing either regarding Rh.

Gates being one you had wrote to Him. (1) Your Exploits keep Congress constantly in remembrance of you. I have seen in others as well as felt in myself a singular Pleasure in the frequent mention of your Name. Your Letters were referred to the Marine Comee-And it is not want of Inclination that you have not a Command given to You either in the Land or Sea Service.(2) All the Land Forces are under certain Commanders which cannot with propriety be removed. We cannot create Men. Nor will Our Circumstances permit us to build Ships for those AUGUST 9, 1779  Captains in the Navy who hang on Us for Command who are already in Our Pay, & who for want of Ships are eating the Bread of Idleness much against their own as well as Our Inclination. The Marine Comee. will however pay due Consideration to Your Letters & wishing as they do, to avail Themselves of Your Activity, Spirit, Bravery and Prudence, will do it, if in their Power. But I would not wish you to be unmindful of what has been done. Your Promotions have been rapid, Had you continued in a steady Command of Men you might perhaps have been only a Captn. Still. Congress could not without manifest Injury to Rule & Order, promote You & at the same Time give you immediate Command. Nor would You have had those Opportunities for Enterprize by which You have so much honored yourself & in some good Measure added to your Fortune; if You had been in steady Command at Camp. Every Thing has been done for You proper for me to Ask, or Congress to grant, considering the Situation of our Affairs. Upon this last Occasion I did not fail to do myself the Pleasure of speaking to your Merits upon the Floor of Congress, nor of interesting myself in your Favour with the Marine Comee. where I can again assure you, you have no need of Advocates-Nor of any Thing but want of Men or Ships to meet with all the Gratification you could wish for. I would not wish to stand in your way, or dissuade you from a Pursuit of your Real Interest & Honor by an Acceptance of Private Employ-& quitting your Expectations in the Continental Road to Honor & Fortune. But I would wish you well to Consider, before you quit a Service you have been honorably advanced in, & in which you still stand most Fair for further Accessions of Glory & Honor, and perhaps Fortune too. Genl. Gates is a Father to the Brave-take his Advice. I wish you to follow his Fortune. If any Thing further should offer, or the marine Com. should find it in their Power to find you immediate Service-I shall inform You with great Pleasure, and shall [ . . .] (3) to escape [ . . .] You contain [ . . .] to merit the [ . . .] Countrymen.

The action between the French And English Fleets of Granado was not so decisive as we wished from the first Accounts, the English fleet is at St. Cits much malled, and have left the Command of the Seas to the French-the Count was not goan to attack St. Cristophers as Reported. On the whole it is very favorabl for us for we are well informed that three thousand troops had imbarcked from St. Lucia onboard their transports bound for Newyork-and we have athentick accounts that 6000 troops have Sailed from England bound to North America-on the whole it appears the Enemy designed to have made a Grand effort this Summer to given us a decisive blow. I hope their Cruel designs will prove Abortive. The 3000 men designed for Newyork will now be wanted to Cover St. Cits, and the french will take Care of their Conquests, and I dont Expect to See Rhode Island so Soon as I mentioned in my last but all in good time.

By him I have just time to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of the 22d of July, (2) for which please to accept my thanks. I find by your observations on the fishery that that matter is not yet properly understood in Virginia, nor have I time at present AUGUST 10, 1779  (were I at full liberty) to undertake the explanation of it-but this you may rely on, that there is not a state in the union, nor I believe, a member in Congress, that would relinquish the right; and Congress soon after I came here, passed a resolution (I believe unanimously) \""that in no event should the common right of fishery be given up.\"" Your former observation on the subject was communicated only to one gentleman besides the Virginia delegates. A vessel arriv'd here yesterday (3) in 17 days from Martinique and brought letters from Mr. Bingham, continental agent at that port, dated 22d July advising that the day before a packet had arrived there in 31 days from France, with advice that the Spanish Minister at the court of France had declared his master ready to enter into a War with G.

7667,dg013361,1779,Cyrus Griffin to Burgess Ball,"""Cyrus Griffin to Burgess Ball   Dear Burgess (1) Philadelphia August 10th [1779] (2) It is a fact that I fully intended to have kept up a correspondence with you; but how the negligence has happened really my Brain is at a loss to determine. After receiving the Letter by Colonel Morgan, and being roused from a lethargy I should have written you much earlier but most unfortunately an ugly sickness fell upon me, and now after fifteen days confinement to the Bed and house I am hardly able to say one word to my Friend. I thank you exceedingly for the kind sentiments upon the new delegation: the mem[bers] continued have discharged [their duty] with credit and fidelity, notwithstanding the Lee party in the Virginia assembly were strenuous of opposition to Smith and myself,(3) and almost carried the point of exclusion. Had they carried such a point the mortification would have been great indeed when considered in that light, but the Individual benefit to our Families would have been as great on the other side; and truly I find it impossible to remain in Congress a long time; I am already some Thousand Dollars out of pocket; my constitution will not support excessive confinement; I only wish to see our brave army placed upon such a respectable footing as their uncommon [. . .] and Patriotism deserve-to see all [. . .] happily adjusted-and the currency of the united states in a fair way of appreciating: and then farewell to public Business eternally. I am shocked to hear your account of the Virginia Regiments, what a curse has been such abominable policy as Short Enlistments! Good Heaven what must be the feelings of a knowing and high-spirited officer in the situation you mention! Never a war was carried on upon such monstrous principles as the present. I am sorry the accountable depreciation of the paper Money has obliged the army to adopt the regulating plan, because certainly if any set of Men are entitled to live in a more splen[did] manner than others it must b[e those who] undergo so much fatigue a[nd . . . ] dangers in securing the freedom and happiness of the whole community. I am no great advocate for the custom of duelling; however if the Enemy will afford no amusement, and Gentlemen are tired of the world I shall not object to their shewing a bloody spirit the very moment before entrance into the holy presence. I do not think your reflections upon the Dominion quite apropos; the Inhabitants of Virginia are much scattered, and certainly it must take some time to collect; the Enemy were not generous enough to wait a competent time. Colonel Morgan (4) is permitted to Virginia without resigning his commission; indeed we could not [permit] such a resignation: I wish some happy [. . .] may be found out for his great [.... abili?]ties [...] upon; I am sorry he is unemployed, and still more sorry should he insist upon resignation. What a brilliant affair that of Stonypoint; it certainly does immortal honor to the wisdom of General Washington, and to the Judgment and Intrepid- AUGUST 10, 1779  ity of General Wayne and all his command, and reflects no small lustre upon the whole of the American Army. The Success of Count de Estaing in the West Indies will probably give a great change in the allied affairs; in all likelihood necessity must compel the Enemy to order some thousand men from this continent, at least a different direction will be made for those who were coming to america; and what shall the people of England say when they [at last] understand that the pride of the Island the British navy have been fairly beaten by the French fleet; surely it will make no inconsiderable noise; the people of England depend totally upon their Navy, and are abundantly too Jealous and diffident of the land Forces. I suppose you know the Enemy are leveling all their works outside of King's Bridge; they are strongly fortifying York, Staten and Governor's Islands. Lord Cornwallis took the command on the first day of August. Sir H. Clinton and Governor Tryon are recalled. The sound fleet are returned to York. Sir George Collier sailed last week with eight ships to reinforce Byron. They say at York the English fleet were severely drubbed. The Enemy by so strongly fortifying stoney point in all probability means to evacuate Verplanks. The above Intelligence we have by a person of veracity just from York. I shall either write you or enclose the paper once a week; lately I have understood you seldom get any in camp. Your Brother is a most extraordinary Genius; many weeks ago a Gentleman from this City carried some articles of great value for Colo. Brachey &c. directed to the particular Attention of Armistead. I have written three letters (5) upon that subject and other matters, and not a single line in answer. Make my best compliments to Gaskins; I hope the pleasure of seeing him upon his return to Virginia. Compliments of the Family wait of you. My Dear Sir, Your affect Friend and Servant. C. Griffin Paper enclosed. [P. S. ] By a vessel this morning from Martinico, the public have the following Intelligence; That Spain will declare in a little time; That Thirty sail of the French line were to rendezvous at Corunna, and join a Spanish Fleet of twenty one; these are to attempt, with twenty thousand men, a descent upon Ireland. That Count de Estaing had defeated British Fleet under Byron with the loss of 175 killed, and about 700 wounded, the Count could not bring all his Ships into action: That Byron escaped in the night understanding that French Admiral meant to renew the Engagement on the next morning.

My last trouble is dated the 3d Inst per post;(1) yesterday I was favored with yours of the 1st (2) accompanied by Copies of three Letters which I fear will be of very little use or service hereafter. Congress as you will read in Dunlap's Paper of this date have \""discharged Mr. Deane from any further attendance\""(3) this Resolution was effected at a time when I was unavoidably absent seeking for new apartments, being obliged to leave these I am in, the day after to morrow; I had previously, but without effect, objected to paying Mr. Deane any Money until he should have accounted for the Sums which he had received in Paris, & pointed particularly at  AUGUST 10, 1 779  those Sums which he had received of Mr. de Beaumarchais & of Mr. Grand after he knew of his being superceded in Office & of the appointment of a Commissioner to succeed him, of which Mr. A Lee takes particular notice in his vindication-the amount of the former you are informed of, that of the latter is upward of £1700 Sterling including all his draughts on the Banker, I say without effect for no support was given to my motion, or so slender a one as not to bring on a question-I think nevertheless, I did my duty & that hereafter I shall be applauded. Congress had determined that the Commissioners & other Agents should respectively adjust their accounts with a person to be appointed for that purpose in France, a measure which I was averse from, yet all things considered, it admitted much good reason in favor of it.(4) After this determination I was called out on the business abovementioned-at my return, I found the Resolve for \""discharging Mr. Deane from further attendance on Congress,\"" this, inasmuch as no provision is made for his Voyage to France nor for his expences there, leaves the adjustment of his accounts optional with him. You will see the Resolves in a few days extended in the printed Journals or perhaps in MS. by the next Post, at present I am in all that embarrassment which attends moving from one House to another & being called off by Committees &c. I began this Note at 6 this Morning 'tis now past eleven, I must fly to Congress where somewhat very Interesting is to be brought on the tapis, permit me therefore to take leave with repeated assurances of being with very great Esteem & Respect Dear sir, Your obliged & obedt. servt, Henry Laurens ""

This moment a letter dated Martinique, 22d July from the Agent Mr. Bingham was read in Congress giving authentick information of the Battle between the Fleets of France & G.B. in those Seas in which the latter was defeted;(1) That G B. had refused the mendiation of Spain whereupon the Count de Oliveriez's fleet of thirty Ships of the line were saild for Corruna to join Twenty Spanish Ships of the line and with 25000 land forses make a descent upon Ireland.

7673,dg013367,1779,Francis Lewis to Stephen Sayre,"""Francis Lewis to Stephen Sayre   My Dear Sir Philadelphia 10th August 1779 Your letter of the 21st Febry 1778 from Copenhagen via St. Croix is the only one I have received from you since the declaration of American Independence, about that time, I wrote you two several letters with duplicates for France, but so many of our dispatches being captured I much doubt whether any came to your hand.(1) By the different manoeuvres of the British Troops, Congress has been obliged to change their places of residence, from hence to Baltimore, thence to this City, then to York Town and back again to this City where they now reside. When at Baltimore I urged your being appointed a Commissr. to one of the European States, but was answered by the Committee of Forreign Correspondence, that you were then Secretary to Mr. A. Lee's Embassy to the Court of Berlin,(2) and proved a barr to your being appointed at that time to another Department. Upon the return of Congress to Phila. in April 1777,  AUGUST 10, 1779  by a new appointment of Delegates for our State I was not in the nomination, and remained so 'till Decemr. of the same year when I was rechosen, and since that time have been Chairman of the Commercial Committee of Congress. Your letter together with that from Mr. Frabitius (whose high Character I was well acquainted with when at Copenhagen) was laid before Congress,(3) who are very sensible of the advantages that would accrew in a Commercial intercourse with Copenhagen, as several supplies of Russian manufactures might be obtained through that Channel, but we are at the same time apprehensive the Danish Court are too much influenced by that of G. B. to wink at such Commerce, tho' it may be advantageous to the Subject; But our greatest difficulty arrises from the mode of Establishing a fund, Rice, Tobbacco, & Indico, are now our principal articles for an European market, and of these we have considerable quantities, but our coasts have been so infested by the British Cruisers that scarsely one Vessell in three escape them, and unless we can establish a fund by loan from some European State, it will be impracticable for us under such circumstances to make payment with our produce, tho' we have more than sufficient in this Country to establish large funds in Europe, could we convey it with any prospect of safety. France being now engaged in a War with G.B. we cannot expect a loan from thence, and I presume Holland is at present sollicited by the Belligerent powers for money, a postcript to your letter hints a thought by Mr. Fabritius \""that a loan of two or three million of Dollars might be negociated at B____ nt,(4) and in case of one years punctual payment of the Interest, he is confident any sums may be had at a very low Interest.\"" Your scheme of sending out goods in Danish bottoms to St. Croix or St. Thomas is feasible, and where we could lodge Tobo., Indico &c to be returned in said ships for payment, but the Risque of Captures between this and the Islands is fully as great, however I shall urge Congress to make an attempt in one or the other mode, it will be therefore necessary that you and Mr. Fabritius inform me with the names of Agents in both Islands who may be appointed by you to receive such Effects; I would here observe that Russian manufactures, such as Canvas for our Navy, Brown Sheeting & Ravensduck for Tents, Brown & white Drillings for the Officers & soldiers-also 7/8 Hambro. Dowlas, & the best Ticklingbgs. from Hambro for soldiers shirts & Overalls, Cordage of all sizes, is always wanted. At the Commencement of the present dispute with G. B. in order to pay our Armies &c, we were under the necessity of making large emissions of paper money, this our Enemies availed themselves of by counterfeiting many of those Bills to a considerable amount, which by their Emissaries were dispersed through the United States, adding thereby to the then more than necessary quantity for a circulat-  ing medium, so alarmed the fears of the people that it has rapidly depreciated the present value of our money. The emissions chiefly counterfeited were of May 1777 & April 1778 which by a resolution of Congress are called in, and the public at large convinced of its bad effects, now cheerfully submit to a heavy Taxation, so as to reduce the remainder to nearly its pristine value; Had taxation been made coeval with emissions, the depreciation would in a great measure have been prevented, but taxation has for four years past lain dormant, nor was it possible to be effected sooner, when we consider that the respective States had new modes of government & new constitutions to form. General Washington has his head quarters at the Highlands on the West side of Hudsons River to cover a strong Post that we occupy on the river at a place called West Point, against which Sir H. Clinton planned an expedition in June last but finding the Post of too great strength, he posted his army nine miles below on both sides the river at opposite points, called Verplanks & Stony point, the latter strongly fortified was on the 15th ulto. at night taken by storm, by Genl Wayne with 1200 Men. The Garrison consisting of 606 Men of which 107 was killed & wounded, the remainder surrendered prisoners of War, and are now confined in this City &c. We have also authentick accounts from Connecticut that another detachment of British Troops from New York & Rhode Island, under the command of Sir George Collier & Genl. Tryon, landed at East & West Haven which they burn't, then advanced into New Haven which they plundered, but before they could fire the Town were obliged by the militia to a precipitate retreat to their ships, from whence they proceeded to Fairfield, and Norwalk, both which they also reduced to ashes. This mode of distressing the Inhabitants indiscriminately, will in my opinion have a contrary effect to what they expected, for by these cruelties the people are become so exasperated that they will retaliate with the utmost rigor.(5) ""

We have just recd. the most Important Dispatches from Martinique-whereby We are well informed, that three thousand troops were embarked at St. Lucee for New York, but were happily called to their Own more immediate Security by Count D'Staing, Of whose great & Signal Success we sincerely congratulate Your Excellency & the State. Our Enemies were determined to have risked their Island with their supposed Superiority at Sea-but they are most happily disappointed in that Object. The Count De Staing rides triumphant in those Seas, and one Island after another, falls to his victorious Arm. The Forts & Batteries at Grenada, were stormed sword in Hand by Himself in Person & carried with but little Loss. Admiral Arburthnot certainly comes out & must be soon expected with six thousand Troops-had they been joined also with the three thousand as intended from St. Lucee, they would have been formidable indeed. The British Tyrant meditated One grand Blow agt. America-and to risk all upon it. Heaven blast his Purpose! The Stroke is fast returning upon his own devoted Head. But we must be awake, & every Man play well his part while Heaven decides for Us. Our Cause being good we want no other arbiter. We are assured by Our Agent at Martinique that the French Govr. informed him that his Intelligence by the last Packet from France then just arrived was that Britain had refused the Mediation of Spain-That the Fleets of France & Spain had joined-Twenty five thousand French Troops were marching down the French Coast to be taken on Board of Transports. Their Object-Ireland. The Scene thickens-but it is observed it is generally darkest the nearest Day! The more the Storm rages-the Sooner Peace may succeed.

C. is much better than we had a right to expect in the begining of the Campaign what we have from  AUGUST 10, 1779  the West Indies far exceed every Idea; Genl Wayne's enterprize at Stonny Point has given a very favorable turn to affairs in that quarter. Indeed the Reports from the Enemy mention large reinforcements but these reports are in a great measure contradicted by those of better authenticity. It is true that Lord Cornwallis is arrivd & I suppose is true that Clinton & several other Genl Officers are call'd home. I shall be happy to hear of our success at Pennobscot, there I must confess I fear a miscarriage, should that be the case we must double our efforts, for it may be depended on that the Enemy will endeavor to carry their desolating scheme to as great a length as possible. But I hope the smiles of Heaven on our exertion will prevent their puting their infernal plans in execution. I am with great Respect & sincerity, Yours, Wm. Whipple (4) ""

The French fleet after the very bloody Engagement off Grenada, have now the Command of the Seas in that Quarter. It is supposed the Enemy intend their last Effort against America this Campaign, 6000 Troops are daily expected to Arrive 2000 of which it is immagined are destined for the Southward. The President of Congress will no doubt inform Your Excellency, how desirous they are to be in readiness to Oppose the Enemy in that Quarter.(1) I have not the least doubt but every necessary Exertion will be made for defence in our State. I have still hopes, notwithstanding the Confidence with which some good Whigs Assert that the 6000 troops will soon be in America; that Britain will find it absolutely necessary to keep them at home, they will in all human probability be much more wanted in Europe for their own defence.

Augst. 12th. 1779 It behoves you to be very industrious in informing good Men, what has caused certain delays in the procedings here for some months back. Let them know that there has not been any Proof of an honest Intention in Britain to treat of Peace; that France & Spain indeed seemed earnest to know our Ultimata, especially in points which were nearly allied to their Interests-Florida & Newfoundland. I have said good Men. I esteem Mr. Ellis Gray one. (1) I have seen his Allarms & Sentiments. I have a desire that such a Man should be well instructed in the Grounds of the Conduct of the Delegates both in Regard to Ultimata, and the Business of our Commissioners. The Party here have industriously sent Paca's & Drayton's Paper to Boston (2) and Mr. Cushing has seen it and makes just such an Use of it in his Letters as you can readily suppose, he gives other People's Remarks, but You cannot swear it is giving his own opinion. Other Folks, & People cannot account for the Vote of the Massachusetts Delegates, after the Information from the french Minister. I again repeat that I hope Mr. Gray will find from you principally or secondarily that the support of a virtuous Officer is exceedingly interesting to Republics. Where Salaries & Fees are the Temptations to serve as in Monarchies, there may be a Levity as to Changes. But the grand Test in Republics should be good Behavior. But, no say some Folks & some Peoples, what is it to the Public whether an Officer is accused rightfully or wrongfully if the State is like to be injured consequentially. What honest Man will venture to become a Successor to an Office vacated on such Principles? We must let Men see that Capacity Honor and Integrity shall support them against all the undermining Acts of the vicious or the darts of Malice. I suppose you will readily see the subordinate Line in which one of the Letter writers acts. I conceive the Copy of Paca's & Drayton's Paper was not sent to either of the Gentlemen above mentioned. I should begin to think better of the Gemmen here if they were in Correspondence with so virtuous a Man as Gray. I mean You should only know he has written for your Clue, not for a direct Ecclaireissement. As to the other, you must have had twenty Oppertunities of Knowing he has seen Pacas & Drayton's Performances without my telling you. Hazh. Ford arrived Augst. 1st in Virginia. He left Mr. Adams AUGUST 12, 1779  June 29 of[f] the Western Isles. Mr. A had good news. Ford will be here in a few days when I will write more fully. We are boguing about 1/2 pay for Life.(3) The Bear is in Licking; but it will be a Bear after all. But the Massachusetts Delegates had better not oppose it, because the Opposition delays Business. If Mr. J. Adams should happily land in yr. Quarter, I hope he will let People & Folks know that he has attested sufficient Vouchers to prove that A Lee has been most falsely accused and greatly injured. Yrs. JL. ""

Yesterday your dispatches by Major Franks under the 21st June containing an account of the Action of the 20th and its consequences were read in Congress (2)-the Enemy's retreat to Georgia which we have heard of from various quarters wants your confirmation. Congress have received intelligence from Martinique indicating a determination on the part of the Enemy to detach about 3000 Troops from St. Lucia to this Continent, most probably to South Carolina, the success of Count d'Estaing in the Naval engagement near Grenada on the rendered it necessary to throw those very troops into St. Christophers for the protection of that Island, you will nevertheless be on your guard and Congress will do every thing in their power to strengthen your hands.

Congress have repeated and reiterated their earnest recommendations to the States of Virginia and North Carolina to march the troops from those States designed to reinforce your Army,(4) and we hope you will be enabled to make a respectable appearance in the Field before the 1st November. Inclosed with this will be found an Act of Congress of the Inst. requesting you to remain in your present command.(5) The fewness of General Officers in your department recommended the measure as necessary to be attempted, we rejoice to find it will be pleasing to our fellow Citizens in that quarter, particularly to Brigadier General Moultrie, and we entertain a confidence that continuing at the head of the Southern forces will eventually prove honorable and beneficial to yourself. We are sorry to inform you that Congress have not received any addition to their Magazines of Military stores. Gunpowder, Muskets & Lead cannot be conveniently or safely spared until we receive further supplies, an event altogether uncertain, thus circumstanced, Congress have resolved by an Act of the 11th Instant Copy of which will accompany this, to reimburse the State of South Carolina the expence of such Military Stores as you shall deem immediately necessary for the defence of the Southern department to be imported by that State.(6) You will be pleased Sir, to inform us as speedily as possible, & from time to time, the state of your Army, and of such particulars respecting your department as may be necessary to lay before Congress.

Yet, surely it must appear odd, at least, if not ungrateful, that I should send scrawl after Scrawl to one who replys in the Ratio of 2 to 7 while I suffer a long very entertaining Letter, from another, of July l9th to lay by me unacknowledged 10 days. Apprized as you must have been by Mr. S.A. of the Principles, Views & Conduct of most political Men here, you may notwithstanding have been unacquainted even till now with the exact Contents of a Paper which is handed about in a particular Circle in yr. Neighbourhood so as to influence the minds of some good men as well as to strengthen the Plots of some bad ones.(1) I wish you to see it, Mr. Ellis Gray, a worthy Man, will put you in the Train of having it, I doubt not: it is too much for me to copy at this Time, and perhaps needless. For if Mr. Gray cannot furnish you with it Mr. Thos. Cushing can. The latter also can, if he will, tell by whose extraordinary Care it was sent to Boston. I own I have much Curiosity to know. Sir, you may see the low arts that have been used to prejudice the Minds of Congress so far as to make them destroy the good Man's prospect of the best Reward in Republics-the approbation of the People. You may feel it by the Use that has been made of the following Scrap laid on the Table by Mr. G. Morris May 3d 1779. Tis the Extract of a Letter from Paris dated the 7th of Decr. 1778 and said to be written by a confidential Friend of the minister of the marine. Mr. Holker furnished it, so that it was probably to him.(2) \""Mr. J. Adams, le Depute ne reussit pas ici que de Raison: il parait etre entierement livre au Sr. Lee, lequel comme vous le Scavez est une espece de fol.\"" Mr. J. Adams the Deputy does not succeed here further than is reasonable: He appears to be intirely devoted to Mr. Lee, who, as you know, is a sort of mad-man. AUGUST 13, 1779  The rest of the paper relates to an appointment of a Monsr. D'obre who is Son in Law of Mr. Schweighauser at Nantes insinuating that he betrays our Vessels to the People of Jersey because he is Son of the Mair of that Place.(3) The maliciousness of wch. I have many Vouchers by me that prove. The Paper concludes with an assertion that if Doctr. Franklin is not sole Deputy in France Things will go on but lamely or in his own Phrase with \""but one wing.\"" I hope Mr. Adams will in a few days be with you: he was left off the western Isles on the 29th of June by a Vessel which arrived at Virginia Aug. 1st. I hope he will come soon on to Congress, And, as C[ush]ing says, \""People here\"" are of opinion that he ought not to come as a Delegate, but in his present Character, and with a proper Dignity, as if he was fit to deal with a gallant Nation. \""People here,\"" are my Circle. If Mr. A.(4) is resolutely determined not to negotiate a Peace for us upon being unanimously chosen for such a Work, then, I would wish him to have an Election as Delegate if he only tames a month upon it; the Election to be made after he is here. As to Peace, I am persuaded the eastern Delegates have always been justly dubious of the reality of any honest Intentions in Britain, tho' we were sure France & Spain were willing to know our Sentiments about Newfoundland & the Floridas. I am pretty sure that what the Gazettes say of the mediation of Spain being rejected is true. Mr. Adams has sent Word that he is coming with good News, and I am told that a Vessel is now in this River after a short Passage from Nantes. I will go to Congress and will not seal till I know whether I can tell you any Thing more explicitly. I find no Letters or Intelligence But shall probably give you a Confirmation by next post of what we are told authentically from Martinique.

At present we are favoured with a flood of good News, the taking of St. Vincent & the Granadas together with some degree of Victory over Admiral Byrons Fleet by the Count DeEstaign, are we believe matters of fact, and Anxiously wait to hear the consequences of the latter or in what manner the good Count may be directed to improve his Victory. The Agent of Congress (Bingham) at Martinique (whos name and the thing too Congress at present seems rather disposed to conceal) expressly tells us that the British Court hath rejected the mediation of Spain, the effect of which will instantly throw that Court into the Scale of France & America-a different writer from the Same place Speaks of an actual junction & a formed Army for the immediate invasion of Ireland, Some Say to Conquer, others with greater probability, to excite & Secure the Independance of that Country-this whatever maybe a brewing I consider at present as premature. We are also assured that at least Six or Seven thousand were ready to Sail as a Reinforcement to the Enemy this AUGUST 16, 1779  Summer-but intelligence of this day Informs that by a fient of the French against Guernsey, four thousand of the above were Sent for the defence of that Island-hence we may hopefully conclude they may either be totally diverted or thrown late in the Season, this which is probably true has an agreeable Aspect. But when I consider Mr. Lovels better memory & especially the late Arrival of Mr. John Adams together with the Minister of France, I am only Sending Coal to New Castle, or Cod fish to Boston. Are you not Ploding how to pay Visit of two days to these Gentlemen at Boston, as it's not probable they will make Providence in their way to this place? The harmony of Congress rather grows than otherwise, there being but One point now on the Carpet in which the House stand Martialed on every side (the retaining or of Arthur Lee) (2) for the Fishery I think has gained a Sufficient political basis in effect amounting to an Ultimatum or Sine-qua-non. On Finance, particularly the Apreciation of our Money and means for domestick Loans in Order to prevent farther emissions, a more Vigorous & effectual Stimulas to Money holders must in my Opinion be Suddenly thrown out, that as little as possible on this essential point may be left to doubtful contingency & caprice, this will probably Soon be agreed on to good effect. In case of an attack from the Enemy if you think of making a Stand at Providence, I hope you have an explicit previous agreement not only with the Militia of that small State, but with a certain body of the more convenient part of Massachusets with established Signals to assist on a very Short notice, other wise your chance is very Small & yr. risque too great, for as your weakness must be certainly known to the Enemy, their movements (if at all) must be Sudden & their force Such as to leave nothing to hazard with yr. few contrasted troops so that if you have not the highest human assurance of Sudden & Sufficient aid, your Situation will be inelligeble-but perhaps the only true alternative an early retreat to the Strong grounds & country of the Massachusets, might be considered as unmilitary-attended with the loss of the Town &c. It might be so considered, but if the Garrison have little or no chance, the Town must also go with it, and the loss of both greater than of One. Forgive these hints thrown out without the advantage of circumstantial knowledge and meaning no more than that you shou'd have a moral certainty of Aid in time of need; you see the old mode of carrying Suddenly by Storm as well here as at the Grenades is like to become fashionable. A certain Committee whereof I am One have prepared a report for your Reinforcement but a good friend of yours wishes the report kept back a little in hopes of being able to make it better,(3) I shall again press the Committee upon it One way or other.

Three great objects require our most serious attentions, the affair of our Army, our paper Currency with which our Finances are connected and the ultimata for peace. You will be surprised when I tell you that notwithstanding the absolute Necessity of a speedy determination on all those points they have been alternately under consideration for several months and no determination yet had on any of them. By the best Accounts we have able to get it appears that Great Britain intended to make this a Vigorous Campaign, four thousand (2) Troops were coming out with Admiral Arbuthnot and 3000 more were embarked in the West Indias supposed for Georgia or South Carolina. It has been fortunate for our Country & our cause that our great Ally has found means to prevent these reinforcements from coming to this Continent. Some persons believe those with Arbuthnot will yet appear. If they do it will be too late to perform any great matters this Campaign. We have no late Official Accounts from France but expect them dayly by the Count de La Luzerne lately arived at Boston.

But I long to be fully disappointed about that Business. I know not the moment that I have dared to think it would be successful, owing to my persuasions that you abound with infamous Tory Informers whom an Embargo does not effect. They have regular Posts. How did my Brother (1) get so early into New York if not by a Chain of Aids. One of yr. Papers speaks of a public Entry of the Fr. Minister to be made at Boston. Prithy dont be foolish. He is not a minister till he gets here. Do look at Holt's Aug. 12. (2) See the Paca-Drayton Folly authenti- AUGUST 17, 1779  cated as by a Cowtee. I think now we may any of us talk about general Pacificat[io]n. The Rascals mean to make some of us appear to be the sole Causes of the Continuance of War, throwing out of Sight that there never was any honest proposition or even desire of Peace in Britain that we knew of. While Rowland (3) gives out Vouchers. Short Specs should in other Quarters spring from them to show the Propriety of supporting a Virtuous Servant in a Republic against any Convenience that may be pleaded of a temporary kind for his Removal founded in little Injuries done to his Character by his avowed Enemies. His Fame will be greater & consequently his services after it has safely undergone Trial in the Crucibles of Malice & Envy. Cunning Folks here are for prefecting & forwarding to a proper Negociation, the Patchwork now on our Table through the Mediation of Spain is rejected because, say they, it will shew our Moderation to Europe, when Gr Br. makes her Appeal to them of her Necessity to go on with Blood. I fear Mr. J.A.(4) would not trust himself again in such a Kind of Service as he has experienced. But by pushing for A first and compromising for an unanimous Choice, our worthy Friend A would be the Man. I believe we shall be able to combat Half pay for Life, only by an Exchange of that Motion for a Recommend[ation] to the states to do Justice by Half pay fir[st] or such other Provision as they may find adequate to the Intentions of the first Motion which are to keep the army together some of whom do, what I call, menace the Continent, making a stalking Horse of their real Sufferings.(5) Your West india News is not quite true. If D'Estaing does not take Antigua I cannot conceive what his Plan is. I begin, as I grow daily more & more ragged, to think seriously about Home, if I may be said in my ruined State to have such a Place. Are any Gentlemen disposed to come this Way who are already on the List? I am astonished at the Expenditures. And chuse that new Subjects should show to our State that there is not a Levity in the old ones springing from long Residence here. But, moreover, while my own Expences are in horrid Ration upwards are not my Family's also, tho' my Recompence for Time may be stationary. If I tarry here I must give the finishing Stroke to the Bread of my Children, for I must buy a Peice of Linnen if not Breeches also. Whereas out of the Deligation I might make out to go bare Back & Bum, especially If I go among Brethren of the Wigwam to spend my latter Days; and I have scarcely any other Prospect.

I am surprized that you had not then heard of the Arrival of Ford on the 1st at Metompkin.(1) Mr. J. Adams was at Braintree on the 3d and Count Luzerne in Boston.(2) I have no Dispatches from either; but I have a Letter from Nantes of May 25th, Extract of which you will see in the Paper of Tomorrow, as well as the Continuation of Rowlands Communications,(3) of Part of what you think ought to be published. You talk of your having a Sort of right to a Copy of the Papers sent by Arthur, you little know of the droll motion made by your merry Friend,(4) to stigmatize Ar[thu]r for having enclosed to an Individual what he desired might be communicated to a secret Commtee of Congress to prevent the Consequences of a palam Examination of the Vouchers. But, as on the one hand I contended for an open reading of the whole that was sent, I most easily convinced the House that every Officer in their Service has a Right to communicate such Papers as these in question to any Individual Friend, on whose Judgment he chuses to depend either to present or burn Resignations, Memorials and Defenses, these being personal Concerns; and I mentioned having by me some Things thus inclosed upon  AUGUST 17, 1779  which I should act my sovereign Pleasure. I thought this necessary, that I may act with a good Grace, if I should see cause to give in any of the Papers now in my Trunk at a Time when it will not be possible to prove a late Arrival. The Motion was withdrawn Inch by Inch. I, pledging myself to prove that Congress never had an official Paper kept from them by the Mode mentioned in the Motion vizt. covering Dispatches of a Minister to an Individual. I mean I pledged myself so far as concerns Ar Lee Esqr. Your Brother was totally mistaken as to D's Credit here. But I wait with impatience to know more by Mr. Adams. Our Penobscot Expedition is not yet well over. Collier may do great hurt there: I have a few Lines from Mr. S A he is as you think greatly engaged in Town and Body Meetings & in the general Assembly. They have great Expectation of mending the Currency by vigorous Taxation & Loan. But I look for Credit to the poor eastern States mainly from a successful Expedition, though even in that Case W.H.D. will be against them: he spouted an invidious motion about their sending their Fleet to relieve 5th Carol. & Georgia. Observe the cursed Rascality of sending to New York as well as to Boston the Paca-drayton Effort, though in the former case there is a superrogatory Lie of its being a Comtee. Information. I find that Paper is stolen from me. It was either Pokipsie or Fiskill you can get it by Enquiry of yr Printer.(5) I have recovered it. The Party are provoked beyond measure at seeing the Vouchers sent out by Rowland; but I tell them, \""they are free for any member who chuses to use them, only it is at his Peril if he does not guard against offending France, Spain or Prussia or exposing honest Whigs to Danger.\"" The affair of Berkenhout can be put in a Light to damn D's (6) Virulence exerted under pretended Care of the public Safety. Simple Views must be first given of the State of Facts and at the Close a Freedom in Inferences, Reflections & Brands may be taken. Indeed this Part may be performed in the different States upon an Exhibition of Vouchers here. It will have more effect by springing from different Quarters. The main point will be to establish the Propriety of supporting Merit in Republics against Envy & Falsehood, rather than suffering it to be crushed from a foolish Idea of Convenience to the Public. The contrary would be to induce eventually a maximum to avoid a present quid detrimenti. I wish yr. Health may suffer you to attend to this. Specs should be short to be generally read. J.L . [P.S.] I will attend to yr. Req[ue]st about Beaumarchais charge. I have no reasons, now in favr. of giving the Resig. but rather the opposite.

By this Express I send you their weekly printed Resolves; for the perusal of the legislature now sitting. I have collected twenty Copies of each sett and now send you four of each, Shall Send the remainder by other opportunities. I shall only beg leave to make the following remark ie the little State of Nw Jersey allow their Delegates in Congress twenty Dollars per diem, & a dollar is rated here in the purchase of necessaries equal to three pence of the old Currency. In the Years 1775 & 76 board & Lodging were at four dollars per week exclusive of liquors, it is now at 100 dollars per week liquors 60 dollors. In short the Delegates of every other State in the Union have a more ample allowance than ours. You'l excuse this hint, but with me it is become necessary having been plundered of nearly my whole property by the Enemy. I have the Honor to be, with the greatest Regard, Your Most Obedient Humble Servant Fra. Lewis P. S. Pray communicate to the Chancellor (1) when you see him. ""

Thank you for the Communication & Congratulate you on the good News it Contains. I recd. the 1600 Dollars of Genl Spencer & last Week Sent Eight hundred dollars to you by Mr. Coit, who was going to Norwich. I Congratulate you on the brilliant Success of our arms on the 17th & 18 Inst at Powlis Hook-when Major Lee with 400 Men Surprized & attacked the garison at that place with fixed Bayonets & without firing a gun, took 160 prisoners, the number of killed & wounded not known, as the party was obliged to retire before morning, our loss only five missing, further particulars not yet Come to hand. Our European Intelligence from Doctr. Franklin, Mr Adams & the Communication of the Minister of France Mr Gérard-is that England has refused to accept the Mediation of Spain, because the preliminary insisted on by France was that they Should also Treat with the States of America as Independant States-and thereupon Spain declared to the Court of Britain that agreable to the Treaties existing between her & France they must take an active part in the warr. On the whole the Situation of affairs in those parts bear a very favourable aspect towards America. Congress have recommended to the Several States to make adequate Compensation to their officers, & Soldiers, in a way that shall be most agreable to the respective AUGUST 23, 1779  Legislatures-also recommended the Continuation of the embargo to the first of Jany. next.

If there is any powder to be Spared from Connecticut for the Army it would be well for the Genl to know it, I told him I thought there was a Considerable quantity might be obtained from thence. Congress have passed a resolution recommending to the Several States to make adequate Compensation to their officers [&] Soldiers in Such way as Shall be most agreable to the respective legisla[tures.](1) Also have passed a resolution recommending to the Several States, to lay & Continue the Embargo on provision & live Stock untill the first day of Jany. next.(2) There is another resolution prepared, to have Justice done among the States, which I think will be Carried as there is a greater prospect of harmony now in Congress than has been for Some time. The resolution directing the Commissary to Supply rations to the militia of Connecticut is not yet passed, but the Committee of which I am one On the Commissarys & Qu[arter]masters departments, have included in their Computation of Sup- AUGUST 23, 1779  Portrait of Jesse Root  plies that will be needed for the Current year those that will be wanted for the guards, & militia of Connecticut; that I apprehend there is no doubt but the resolution will pass. Accounts from Europe are that the Expedition against Guernsey has failed. Admiral Arbuthnot with the four thousand Troops that had Embarked for America went to its aid-he has returned, & left Plymouth the last of May for America-It is Said a Second Expedition is in Contemplation against that Island. The Court of great Britain, Sundry times in the Course of last Winter in an Indirect manner Signified to the Court of France a desire for peace, of which France took no Notice, Judging it to be Improper while Britain had not determined whether She would accept the Mediation of Spain which then was proffered-but Spain began to Suspect that the pacific professions of Britain were rather to delay & gain time than from a Sincere disposition to peace. Instructed their Ambassador Count Almodaver to insist on a Catagorical answer whether Britain was Sincerely disposed for an accomodation & would accept the proffered Mediation of the King of Spain to these Questions Britain replied that they were Sincerely desireous of a peace with France-and being informed that France Could not enter into a Seperate Treaty; but that Britain, as a preliminary, must, also, Consent to Treat with the States of America as free & Independant States. Britain rejected these Terms, and the Ambassador anounced to the British Court that the King of Spain his master was bound by Treatys, then existing, to take an active part in the war with France. These negotiations were carried on between the 26th of April & the 1 7th of May, at a time when the British Court was flushed With their Successes in the East & West Indies & at Georgia. The Court of Britain is Viewed by the powers of Europe in an unfavourable light on account of her haughtiness & pride which all are willing to Se[e] humbled. While the King of France by his Wisdom, moderation & Justice displayed in Mediating a peace between Russia & the Turks between the Emperor of Germany & the King of Prusia, four of the greatest powers in Europe, So much to the Satisfaction of all parties, has raised him high in the Estimation of all Europe, and it is Confidently beleived that Great Britain will be unable to obtain any foreign aid to assist in the war more than she has already got-by all the advices from Europe things there wear a very favourable aspect towards America. And I firmly beleive, as I ever have done, that in Spite of the utmost exertions of our Enemies, & a thousand Errors & impolicies of friends, a Kind Providence will lead America, as by the hand, through this Wilderness of darkness & of dangers & cause her one day in triumph to possess & enjoy, peace, freedom, Independance, & Glory-and on Se[e]ing the accomplishment of this Event, I fancy your Excellency will be almost ready to Say; Now Lord! let thy Servant depart in peace. The particular designs of the Enemy this   Campaign have not been discoverable. Congress has Earnestly recommended to all the States Suddenly to fill their battalio[ns] & to hold their militia in readiness for immediate action, in order[to] be prepared for the Enemy at all points whatever their opperations may be. And I doubt not but our Exertions will increase in Strength & vigor in proportion as we draw nearer to the point of seising the glorious prize for which we have so long & so nobly Contended. August 24th. By a letter from Arthur Lee it appears to be his Opinion that the hostile disposition of great britain is not abated towards America. That if a Change in the ministry Should take [place] they would endeavour to prevail on Prince Henry of Brunswick to take the Command in America in whom both the British & German Troops will be united. He thinks that Britain, in Consequence of the peace in Germany will be able to derive Considerable aid from thence. He writes that the recruiting business goes on Slowly in England. The Scotch are greatly displeased at the favour Shewn to the Roman Catholics. Ireland is in the Same way we were four years ago, have their non importation agreements, are furnishing themselves with arms & meeting to learn Military discipline without governments daring to take notice of it. Permit me to Congratulate your Excellency on the brilliant Success of our arms at Powlis Hook in the night following the 17th when Major Lee with four hundred men surprised the garrison with fixed bayonets & without firing took & brot. off 160 prisoners. The numbers killed & wounded on the side of the Enemy not known-as our party retired before it was light-our loss only five Missing.

It gives me pleasure to find by Your favor of the 8th inst that you have got the better of Your indisposition & I hope shortly to have the additional satisfaction of being informed that your health is perfectly restored. The Confederacy is still waiting for her freight,(1) I fancy a late arrival at Boston will hasten her departure. A long Political letter has been receiv'd from Mr. Adams in which he gives a high Character of his Companion from France.(2) I hope this Gentn will receive such impressions in the Country where he first landed as will sufficiently Guard him against the pernicious Air of Philaa. From the Character given of him there is no room to apprehend much danger of his being drawn into party by the insidious acts of base, designing men, but still it may not be amiss to fortify him against any such attempts. The arrival of Mr. Adams may make a change in some Political plans, I wish he wod come this way but I do not understand he has any such intention. The reading of Dr Lee's vindication &c afforded me high entertainment,(3) Envy, malice, and every vindictive passion that disappointed malevolence could inspire appeared on various countenances round the Room. Fiddle head shook,(4) Swivel Eye, nestled & turnd pale,(5) the Chair, changed colour at every sentence,(6) some others forced a sneer endeavouring to conceal their shagreen & Confusion, This you may well suppose afforded me no small degree of enjoyment. The Base Viol has tarried a fortnight beyond the time he some time ago set for his departure,(7) he has met with something of late that has lowered him exceedingly but what it is I know not, perhaps it may be the Oath you mention.(8) What can be become of Ford it is now ten days since a fellow Passenger of his passed through this City who informed that Ford had dispatched for Congress, but nothing further has been heard of him, it is hinted by some that he will not be permitted to pass this way, but those are not remarkable for their Friendship for his late employer. I shall not be under the least concern for the fishery if a proper person can be agreed on to negotiate the business but that still remains a matter of uncertainty. The resignation of Dr Lee at this time wod certainly be injurious, 'tho I hope when he has compleated the business that I expect he is now engaged in he will ask leave to come to America, but in my Opinion it will be best not to resign. The thought of his coming to this Country wod make some of the Villains tremble, but if he resigns it will be said he has no intention of coming here, and many injurious stories will be circulated that may make an impression that may  AUGUST 23, 1779  give him or his friends some trouble to remove. The few select Friends who you have Honoured with your Confidence have considerd the subject submitted to them, their Opinions will be given you by Mr L____ or Mr L____ l (9) who no doubt will write you fully on the subject. It is uncertain when I shall take my leave of this place but I believe it will be Octor first when ever that happens or where ever I may be, to hear of Your Happiness will always be a great addition to mine.

I am persuaded that Watchmen of Integrity are necessary for us abroad; but I would not chuse to em ply Jealousy or Suspicion for such Ends; they never see truly all round. I am in hopes that a Treaty of Alliance will shortly be formed with Spain, and I am sure that then AUGUST 24, 1779  Mr L (5) will think he can resign with honor. He would now appear to do it thro fear or thro fret. Yr. affectionate humble Servant, James Lovell ""

7739,dg013433,1779,Henry Marchant to Horatio Gates,"""Henry Marchant to Horatio Gates   Dear Sir, Philadelphia Augt. 24th. 1779. I was much obliged by your kind and Polite Favour of the 2d Instant. Ever since Glovers Brigade was recalled from your Post I have been full of Concern for you. I wrote the Gov. what I had done in Congress upon that Occassion, (1) but as I could not get a Comee of which I was one, to report any other Mode of releiving you than by again calling upon the neighbouring States, I thought such a Report altogether ineffectual, and so your Post must still be committed to Our own internal Exertions, as has been for most of the Time the Case, To your superior Generalship, and what is most to be relyed upon-The Care of Heaven. The Returns you inclosed me, I could wish for an Opportunity to make a proper Use of. It is said that you have sent Col. Jacksons Regiment on to Boston to embark for Penobscot and that so late as the 12th Instant they were just marching into Boston. This I can scarcely credit, considering your own defenceless Situation-And how late in the Day such a Succour must be. You doubtless have had Notice long since that Comr. Collier had sailed in Force to relieve the British at Penobscot. If, as it is thought, he saild for that Post, I think he must have arrived by the tenth or twelfth. And I fear the jig is up with Us. At first we were told that fifteen hundred Men had failed to dislodge the Enemy-Now that Our Forces are not more than Eight or Nine hundred and the Enemy at least seven of regular Troops. I pray God his Miracles may not cease.(2) I hear my brave Talbot has taken Stanton Hazzard.(3)-was it since Independance took Place that he took the Active Part against the  AUGUST 24, 1779  Country that gave him Birth & reared him to Manhood-It may not be surprising if he should find powerful Friends and advocates. The Boston Papers intimate a reasonable Expectation of making a capital Stroke upon a Jamaica Fleet: and that Manly had taken a new built Frigate. Genl. Sullivan is penetrating the Indian Country & has destroyed two Indian Towns. The Flees could not be catched tho' they gave Us several severe Bites. We indeed may not expect to catch Indians. But the destroying their Towns, and taking a Number of old Men, Women e Children may strike an awe upon Their Minds and secure us against future Depredations, & Barbarities upon Our Inhabitants. It is a mere Indian Expedition-I hope the Advantages will answer to the great Expence, and the Injury sustained by weakening other Posts for that Pursuit. Wishing allways for the best, I content myself with waiting for the Event. Your Express went off before I could prepair any Letters and wishing rather to write by Express, than the Post, I have omitted the acknowledging Your Goodness till now. I am much pleased as well as honored by Your Assurance that \""At Times, when Matters worthy Note arise I may hear from You.\"" I heartily congratulate you upon the second brilliant Stroke upon the North River. The Glory acquired hereby to the American Army, the glorious Success of Our Allies in the West Indies-And the perfect most favourable Disposition of European Powers. I am Dr. Sir Yr friend & Servt, Hy. Marchant ""

We are every Moment in Expectation of seeing the Prisoners pass thro' the City 160 in Number. Several Schirmishes terminating much to Our Honor have happened on the East Side of the River. Genl.

Livingston   Dear Livingston Philadelphia 24th Augt. 1779 Much of a Man's political Opinion depends I believe upon his natural Temperament. I am a little sanguine and never look upon the dark Side of Objects unnecessarily. George the second heard from Lord Chesterfield a Conversation which passed in his Lordship's Presence very abusive to the Prince but which terminated in a Quarrel when a French-Man took a Share in the Business of Detraction. The old Monarch laughed very heartily & replied by God my Lor I love my Subjick dey be ver good Subjick dey abuse me demself dey let no Body else abuse me. This is very much the Situation of the American Citizens & American Congress or I am much mistaken. As for the Committees (1) they are the Nebula leves which variegate the Horizon no more at least in the State of New York. The Bait was flattering. Let us regulate ie let us take our Neighbour's Property and convert it to our Use. But unfortunately the Means are wanting because there is none of that Property in the State and the late Applications to the Philadelphia Committee will convince the People of their Folly. For Notwithstanding the warm Recommendations of the Committee of Albany the Agents could not gain Permission to carry away a single Peck of Salt. I have taken Measures to provide it for the State. As to the Gentleman you mention as having been concernd in promoting the Measure I doubt not that he has long felt the tedium of inactive Life but whether that or any other Cause hath prompted this Manoeuvre I will not pretend to discover without knowing which at this Distance I cannot do the several Minutiae of Circumstances which color all human Conduct. As to the Changes you mention to have happened in our Legislature I am truly far from regretting them. It shews me that there hath AUGUST 24, 1779  been much of Indolence somewhere and I conjecture everywhere. This will be punished but of Consequence it will be for a Time at least cured. What you may be able to do and had far to restrain others from Doing I know not. As to the Gentleman you mention to be sent hither it is of little Consequence. I have seen virtuous Labors so often overthrown that I am inured to it. The high Character which the State of New York has gained must sometime or other fall and whether it be this or a future Year Is not of much Importance. I have labored long to support it and when the State dismiss me from their Service I shall be dismissed from my Labors. As to the Desire of avoiding Censure. I consider it as a trifling Motive. Let a Man take a great Line of Conduct and let him take the Consequences. As to the Revolutions in Philadelphia Politicks I said nothing because I had nothing to say.(2) I perceive no Revolution but I have long perceived revolution Principles. This State is a great unweildy Mass badly jointed. If I may be allowed the Expression it is hooped by Opposition and when that ends must crumble to Pieces. I tell you here the Observations of a Spectator for I cautiously avoid medling in Matters of this Sort unless indeed in Cases, should such happen, where the great Continental Interests are at Stake. As to our Friend Morris he stands in good Estimation indeed the Thing could not be otherwise for an honester Man is not on Earth and the attacks made on him have demonstrated it. Your former Letters were received. Some Persons have of late busied themselves to [ . . . ] Arthur Lee the Success of which will I imagine be counter to the Attacks on Morris and equally disappoint the Projectors. Spain hath at Length taken a decided Part whereon I congratulate you and my other Friends. To all of them remember me with the Warmth of Affection. Adieu. Yours, Gouv Morris ""

Shall, as duty may direct, Communicate to you every important matter that may come to my knowledge.

Frequent information of the Circumstances & Transactions of our Constituents even in matters which at first view, might be thought of little importance, would serve many Valuable purposes; As the Sentiments of the Citizens of any State may in some measure be drawn from their public proceedings, and of Course will prove useful lessons of instruction to their Delegates, & be happily influential upon their Conduct Especially in Such matters as more immediately effect the interest of such State. The foregoing Consideration would alone be Sufficient to Convince me of the Absolute Necessity of an authority being Vested in some person or persons who may officially Transact the aforemention'd, and many Other essential matters for keeping, in regular motion the Various wheels of the Great Political Machine.

Yours also of the 6th to Mr. Huntington &c. came safe to hand. AUGUST 24, 1779  You Justly regret the depreciated Credit of our money & it must be the most ardent wish of every friend to his Country to put a Stop to the depreciation. Could we once gain this point I should imagine the danger would be over, for it would then naturally appreciate by means of Economy & regular taxation as fast as would be just & Safe. A general regulation of prices through out the Continent Supported by Economy & taxation would have a Mighty Influence in this business but I doubt the practicability of the Measure. A foreign loan might unquestionably be improved for very great & good purposes, but this we are Informed would be very dificult to obtain at present. Congress have by a Resolution recommended to the Several States to make adequate Compensation to their officers & Soldiers in Such way as Shall be most agreable to their respective Legislatures. (1) This I beleive will have a good Influence upon the Army, however if the Expedient you propose Shall be found necessary for recruiting the army it may be adopted tho, I think much advantage redounds to the public from the Spirit of enterprize in the privateering way. The Situation of affairs in Europe Seem to bear a very favourable aspect towards America. I Congratulate you on the brilliant Success of our Arms at Powles Hook in the night of the 17th which I presume you will hear before this reaches you. I inclose to you a Newspaper & a Scheme proposed in this City for raising money by Subscription you will See the plan. Ireland is going on much as we were about five years ago. The Scotch are much disaffected on account of the favour Shewn to the Roman Catholics.

(1)  AUGUST 24, 1779  Some of the Publications I must confess gives me great pain these are among the multitude of Evils America has to combat, these things will undoubtedly give a handle to our enimies & perhaps be a means of protracting the war, they serve to show that we have still concealed enimies among us, if we never had had any such the war wod have been at an end long ago, however I comfort myself with hopes that the present evils tend to future good; the more difficulty we are at in obtaining the jewel the higher value we shall set on it consequently shall be more careful to preserve it. As to the effect these things have on our present ally you may be assured she has too high a sence of our Friendship to suffer such matters to produce the least abatement in her exertions to support our cause. The arrival of the new Minister may be productive of great good it may be improper to enter fully into the Character of his predecesser at present. The accots from Europe are highly Flattering. England has not the least prospect of any powerful Aid to support her in the war on the other hand there is the highest probabil[it]y that Spain has commenced Hostilities against her after the arrival of the new Minister here I shall be able to give you a particular accot of things which I shall endeavour to do in the fullest manner in the mean time I beg You will Comfort yourself with a full perswasion that every thing respecting America is in the most promising scituation, except finance & I am far from being hopeless that, that will shortly be on a better footing.

Since my last to you I have been favored with yours of the 2d and 9th inst. With regard to restrictions on trade I fully agree with you. I was ever of opinion that such measures would never answer any thing more than mere temporary purposes and whenever they were come into, it should be done with the greatest caution. I imagine it will require as much virtue to lend money without interest as to sell goods for a less price than the buyer would be willing to give-in short this business of finance is very intricate-there are as many different opinions respecting it as there are persons that think of the  AUGUST 24, 1779  Subject, but whenever a plan is adopted, the less opposition it meets in the execution the greater will be the probability of its answering salutary purposes, but while every man is so exceedingly fond of his own brat, it is impossible that any plan should be adopted that will not meet with numerous opposers-however I hope these difficulties will all be got over some time, or other. When the new Minister arrives here and the budget is open, perhaps I may have something interesting to communicate-at present have only newspapers for your amusement-they it's true contain some things interesting-they show that spirit of enterprize has got into the army which may produce happy effects. I am with sincere affection, your's, Wm Whipple. [P.S.] Was I accustomed to tremble, I should tremble for our Penobscot Fleet. ""

(1) Britain refused the mediation of Spain at a Time when their Spirits were elated by their Successes in the West Indies, and the southern States; and by the Accounts they received of Discord in Congress, Discontent among the People, and a Prospect of the Evils with which we were threatned by the Depreciation of our Currency. Deceived by these illusory Gleams of Hope, they permitted their Counsels to be guided by their Pride. What Reason they may have to expect Succour from other Powers, is as yet a Secret. Mr. Gérard is decided in his opinion, that they will obtain none. The Conduct of France in establishing Peace between Russia & the Porte has won the Heart of the Empress; and the Influence of Versailles at Constantinople, will probably give Duration to her Gratitude. The Emperor & Prussia are under similar obligations. The latter wishes us well-and the Finances of the former are too much exhausted to support the Expences of War without Subsidies from Britain, who at present cannot afford them. There is no Reason to suspect that the Peace of Germany will soon be interrupted. Britain may hire some Troops there but it is not probable she will be able to do more. Portugal and the Dutch while directed by their Interest, will not rashly raise their Hands to support a Nation, which like a tower in an Earthquake, sliding from its Base, will crush every slender Prop that may be raised to prevent its Fall. General Waynes Letter has been referred to the Committee of Intelligence for Publication.(2)  AUGUST 25, 1779  You may remember Sir! to have received a Letter from me last winter recommending the Person who carried it as an honest Man and who in my opinion would with great Fidelity do the Business you wished and I advised him to undertake.(3) In May last I recieved a Letter from him, informing me of his having written to you at the same Time, and mentioning a Matter of very delicate Nature, which I believe was omitted in your Letter. As he gave me Reason to expect he would soon be here, I avoided Particulars, not choosing to risque more on Paper than was necessary. He has not however been here-nor have I recieved a Line from him for some Time past. From this Circumstance I have been apprehensive of his having relinquished that Business and the more so, as he intimated to me his Doubts of it's being well conducted unless under your immediate Direction-that the Views of the Gentleman with whom he first conversed on the Subject, were not very extensive, & his Attention to Expences too great. The opinion I have of this Man's usefulness, leads me to mention these Matters-that if he has left the Business I might, if you think proper, press him to resume it. If he still perseveres, I do not wish to be informed of any other Particulars . With perfect Respect & sincere Regard I am, Dear Sir, Your most obedient Servant, John Jay ""

James Lovell (Copy) Nantes May 25th. 1779 I inclose you an English Paper of May 15th whereby you will see the Temper of the English Councils & the Failure of the Prince Nassau's Expedition to Jersey & Guernsey. However, as the Troops AUGUST 25, 1779  that were designed for America, under Convoy of Admiral Arbuthnot (being 4000) went to Guernsey, it is probable they will be detained some time & possibly it will prevent their going out at all, as it is reported here daily that a second Expedition is designed for the same Place. So far this will make in our favor. The English look on that Expedition to be nothing but a feint Manoeuvre and are greatly apprehensive that the French have Views of higher Consequence; as in Ireland & Scotland there are great Disorders & Insurrections. There are now in the Province of Normandy 85,000 Troops and all Merchant Ships & Vessels are taken into the Service, but for what purpose is kept a Secret. I am extremely happy at the Notice with which the Marqs. de la Fayette has been honored from the King, by his giving him his own Regiment of Dragoons which are, it is said, going to America with the Marquis, likewise the Count de la Luzerne as Ambassador in place of Monsr. Gérard, who has desired a Recall on account of his Health. The Count is a perfect Gentleman & has had very favorable impressions respecting the Americans. You will find him Courteous, Affable & Polite without Ostentation; and I think, from 2 or 3 times in which I have had the Honor of Conference with him, he will very much please the Congress & People of America. The Marqs. de la Fayette has given his majesty & the Court an exceedingly high Character of his new Allies. The Fleet at Brest consists of 33 or 34 Ships of the Line besides Frigates under the Command of Count D'Orvilliers and tis said they are to sail tomorrow, but it is not known to what Place.

7751,dg013445,1779,John Jay to George Clinton,"""John Jay to George Clinton   Dear Sir, Philadelphia, 27 Aug. 1779. If New York and New Hampshire will by acts of their respective legislatures authorize Congress to settle the line between them; and if New York will further by act of Legislature, empower Congress to adjust the disputes with the people of the grants on equitable and liberal principles, I am persuaded it would conduce to the interest and happiness of the State.(1) The apprehension of interfering with your police on the one hand, and the apparent equity as well as policy of hearing the revolters, before a decision against them on the other, are obstacles which at present embarrass Congress. Mr. Duane was of opinion before he left us that we should forbear further proceedings on this subject in Congress till the sense of our Legislature should be known. I hope it will be one of their first objects, and they will not be too nice and critical in their reservations and restrictions. The jurisdiction is the great point. It is of no great consequence to the State who possess and cultivate the soil, especially as we have vacant lands enough to do justice to individuals who may suffer by a decision against them. There are many other matters about which I should write to you, were it necessary. As Mr. Morris and Mr. Duane will be with you, you will obtain more particular information from them than my letters. I wish the Legislature would make it a standing rule, to direct the attendance of some of their Delegates at every session, and enter into free conferences with them on the great affairs of the Continent. Many advantages not necessary to enumerate would result from AUGUST 27, 1779  such a measure. In times like the present it would be imprudent to trust some things to letters, which at best cannot be so satisfactory as personal interviews. Several circumstances which have come to my knowledge, lead me to suspect that pains have been taken to injure Morris in the opinion of his constituents.(2) Justice to him as well as regard to truth obliges me to say that he deserves well of New York and America in general. It has been the uniform policy of some, from the beginning of the contest, to depreciate every man of worth and abilities who refused to draw in their harness. Pennsylvania suffers severely from it at this day. Many of their former faithful and able servants have been dismissed, and others called to office, who rather receive importance from, than give weight to, the place they fill. The moment any State ceases to be ably as well as honestly represented in Congress, it becomes a cypher, and its vote will no longer be directed by the interest and sentiments of the State, and Union, but by the art and management of designing and plausible politicians. I think it my duty also upon this occasion to assure you that Mr. Duane's industry and attention to business as well as his invariable attachment to the welfare of those who sent him, deserve their commendation. Colonel Floyd's conduct while here gained him much respect; he moved on steady uniform principles, and appeared always to judge for himself, which in my opinion is one very essential qualification in a delegate, and absolutely necessary to prevent his being a mere tool. I have prevailed upon myself to make these representations because I think them just, and because I cannot suppose they will be ascribed to improper motives by any; by you I am sure they will not. Popularity is not among the number of my objects. A seat in Congress I do not desire, and as ambition has in no instance drawn me into public life, I am sure it will never influence me to continue in it. Were I to consult my interest, I should settle here and make my fortune; were I guided by inclination, I should now be attending to a family, who independent of other misfortunes, have suffered severely in the present contest. It is of great importance that your delegation here do not remain long in its present situation. Whatever men you may think proper to send, let me again and again press you to send able ones. The reputation of the State is exceeding high. It would be mortifying to see it diminish. Permit me also to suggest the propriety of adopting a plan by which Massachusetts provides for the maintenance of her delegates. They have a house and keep a table at the expense of the State, besides which an allowance is made them for the maintenance of their families, who ought not to suffer by the loss of that time which is devoted to the public service. Your Delegates on the contrary are not allowed sufficient to maintain or rather subsist themselves.   I have heard of two or three gentlemen, proposed in your State as Delegates, the Chancellor, Gen Schuyler &c. There is another of whom I have heard no mention, Mr. Hobart, who, if he could be spared, would in my opinion be a good member; during the winter he might remain here without great inconvenience to you. I am obliged to conclude. I am, Dear Sir, your obt. Servt. John Jay ""

Mason that he had directed his Brother to pay him, but antedates his letter three or four months, this Mr. Mason says he can prove, the above is what I have been told by several Gentleman that have conversed with Mr. Mason & has seen the papers. Something ought to be done relative to this man, if the above is true, & nobody here doubts it, Mr. Lee ought not to be employed any longer in the service of the United States. If my prayers or wishes are of any consequence, you are restored to health long before this; pray Remember me to Sir James, Colo.

The very difficult approaches, and the very dangerous retreat, makes it if possible a more brilliant affair than that of Stoney point-particulars of which you may see in one of the inclosed Papers. Genl. Washingtons & Major Lee's letters came to hand yesterday accompanyed by the British Standard-but too late to have a place in this mornings paper. The new Minister has not arived at this place. No news from Europe since you left us-nor from the West Indies. No certain accounts of the surrender of Penobscot-reported that it surrendered the 5th Instant. I think it may be depended on that Arbuthnot arived at New York the beginning of the week. It is said he has about 4000 Troops. Last Sunday one of Blair Mclenahans armed vessels took one of Arbuthnots fleet off Eggharbor & sent into this River-she will be up to day it is said her cargo consists of a number of pieces of Brass artilery, Cloathing, Tea, Silks &c.-of great value.

7765,dg013459,1779,Cornelius Harnett to Richard Caswell,"""Cornelius Harnett to Richard Caswell   Dr Sir, Philadelphia August 31st. 1779. Since I had the honor of writing to your Excellency a few weeks ago,(1) great changes have happened in the face of Political affairs in Europe. The Court of London's refusing the Mediation of Spain, brings the latter into an immediate Commencement of Hostilities, which by the latest accounts received, (tho not officially communicated as yet,) are already begun, and may perhaps be a means of continuing the War some time longer should the Allies be successful this Campaign, perhaps Britain may be brought to reason, and agree to negociate the next winter. Sixty odd sail of large vessels entering at Sandy Hook, a few days ago, makes it probable Arbuthnots fleet is arrived with Troops- some say 8000, some 4000, & others 3000. The successes of the combined Fleets of France & Spain, in the West Indies, may oblige the Commander in Chief at New York to send strong reinforcements to the British Islands which will help these States greatly. It is thrown out that the Enemy intend to carry on no more than a Depredatory war against these States for the present laying aside the Idea of Conquest. It therefore no doubt behoves the several states to guard well their Sea coasts. Your Excellency will no doubt be particularly attentive to this circumstance. I would wish the state I have the honor to represent, had been more attentive to the procuring arms  AUGUST 31, 1779  to put into the hands of our people. I fear should any attack be made upon us that we shall be exceedingly deficient in this useful article for defence. Surely something is done at the mouth of Cape Fear River-a very small battery of heavy Cannon there, would protect us (at least) from small Cruisers. The Count De-la-Luzerne is not yet arrived from Boston. Mr. Gérard remains here until he comes, & then will proceed in a Frigate for France. The Count is represented as a Gentleman of great politeness, and a consummate Politician, connected with many of the first families in France. The two late very Brilliant affairs at Stoney Point and Powles Hook shews that a spirit of Enterprise has taken possession of all ranks in the army-and will no doubt make the Enemy very cautious in their movements hereafter. It is impossible for a person at a distance to conceive the excessive prices every necessary of life is advanced to in this City. Congress seem determined to put a stop to further emissions of money. I wish they may be able to accomplish this desirable object, and supply their Army-but many are apprehensive of the Consequences that may attend the measure. We are informed that the N. England Expedition against Penobscot has failed, and that the Enemy has destroyed or taken the little fleet. This misfortune has been long expected, expeditions by Sea are dangerous while the Enemy's Fleets continue the command of that Element. I hope this affair is not so bad as represented. Congress have not as yet recieved the account from authority. I take the liberty to enclose a few news papers, and have the honor to be with great respect, your Excellencys mo. ob. huml. Servt.

7769,dg013463,1779,Henry Laurens to Richard Henry Lee,"""Henry Laurens to Richard Henry Lee   My Dear sir, Philadelphia 31st August 1779. Since the date of my last trouble the 24th Inst.(1) I have been honored with your favors of the 13th & 23d, (2) The former by an express Messenger, who assured me he should not return till this day, but I learned last Night at Mr. Lovel's that he went off suddenly on Sunday. Yesterday I received at Congress two Packets & one small Letter directed to you, these I apprehend came by the Eastern Post, at Mr. Lovel's request I shall send them to him to be forwarded in a proper manner. I am sorry to find you continue an Invalid, but how can it be otherwise if you also continue to fatigue both body & mind. You must not allow the attempts & designs of wicked Men to operate in the very manner they would wish, let us proceed fairly, & softly & wisely and truth will drive them out of their entrenchments, they are now closely hemmed in & cannot escape. On Tuesday last at the reading of a Letter from A. Lee Esqr. I moved to commit that Letter together with Mr. Lee's vindication to a special Committee,(3) besides the reason of the thing, I grounded my motion on a Commitment of a late Memoire from Mr. Deane, a Copy of which you will receive herewith, you will give this performance a proper name (4)-the Motion was laboriously opposed & in C. T's language,(5) after sometime spent in debate, ousted by a motion for adjournment. On some day since Tuesday, a Report from the Treasury was taken up recommending a Warrant to Issue for 10000 Dollars to the Honorble S. D. Esqr in full for his Expenses, from the 4th June 1778. I opposed the Payment of that or any Sum to Mr. Deane until he should account for the large Sums of Public Money which have been in his hands-the question was put shall ten thousand stand- lost. Motion to insert 15000-question lost-to insert 12000-lost-to insert 10500-carried even by voices who were against 10000 or any Sum, because they were wearied & had been wearied; this deficiency of firmness & perseverance is the source of much irregularity & much evil in public business. The Yeas & Nays were called for in every stage & finally upon the Resolution, I reflect with pleasure that I stand uniformly through the whole.(6) A question was asked of the Treasury, has Mr. Deane given in an account of his expences? artfully replied to by a Gentleman (7) who had formerly AUGUST 31, 1779  given proofs of his abilities in answering Interrogatories-not a regular one-not a regular one-this Gentleman perfectly well knew, that Mr. Deane had given in a very minute one, amounting to 29000 Dollars & upwards, he also knew the artifice which had been practiced by one of his Colleagues on The Board to repossess Mr. Deane of a Paper which he discovered could not be crammed down the throats even of the Treasury. I had seen that account & had been promised a Copy of it but as I am informed, Mr. Duane the very next morning acted a high passion of offence at so shameful a demand & his zeal for the public good carried him rather beyond the line of prudence, he ordered that the Account should be immediately carried back to the demandant, with a declaration that Congress would allow no such accounts-as Mr. Deane has not judged it proper to return that or any other, 'tis not to be doubted but that a Gentleman of Mr. Duane's candor now regrets his rashness in parting with the original. I received this relation from one of those worthy friends who sincerely wish to see right done, but who will not encounter the trouble necessary to accomplish right. I shall endeavor to trace this matter to its source & possibly the whole House will be informed of it. Saturday last a Letter from Mr. Wm. Lee accompanied by his vindication was brought into Congress, but the \""Order of the day\"" laid those papers asleep, yesterday an attempt was made to keep them out of hearing a little longer, I complained heavily of the Innovation & after much debate they were in part read, the House grew thin, & at length only eight states being present, adjourned-I believe I am wrong, W L's papers were read, those from A L. were not. (8) My Colleague Mr. Drayton has been confined to his Bed some three weeks past, when I had learned that he was really ill, I could not refrain from visiting him, his permission being previously obtained. When I approached his Bed he clasped my hand & wept affectingly. After recovering his voice he signified his great satisfaction at seeing me & particularly requested I would write a state of his Case to Mrs. Drayton-the Physicians think him dangerously ill, say he may live one or two weeks longer-that if he has strength to support the discharge from an abscess in his side, they shall raise him again, but that he will remain an Invalid several Months. Upon Mr. Drayton's recovery or upon the arrival of another Colleague my continuance here partly depends, but I am much inclined to return homeward in the course of next Month, I believe I shall have the honor of waiting on you before the 1st October. Finances as they were. News from Penobscot very unfavorable but no particulars. I would compound for the loss of all our Ships provided the Soldiers & Sailors escape Capture. Dunlap's Paper of this Morning will present Rowland some intelligence.(9) I beg Sir you will present my Compliments to your Brother I shall   have much to say to both you & him when I have the happiness of meeting you-deferring to that time will be best-many Clouds will in the meantime pass away & subjects in embrio be matured. I remain with sincere Esteem & Respect, Your obliged & faithful humble servant. Henry Laurens. ""

Lanuville.(3)  SEPTEMBER 1, 1779  Mr. Thomson's Answer-It is not yet entered on the Journal. Go back to Mr. Thomson, give my Compliments and tell him Mr. Duer and Mr. Lanuville are now here, and that Mr. Duer is desirous of seeing it as it is. Mr. Thomson's answer-I can't and will not send it-I have it only scrabled on a Piece of Paper. Mr. Duer expressed great surprise at Mr. Thomson's behaviour and at my patience, and then retired. I then sent Mr. Custer with the following Message-Go back to Mr. Thomson, give my Compliments to him, tell him I am much obliged, and I must submit to him. Mr. T's. Ansr.-Well, tell him I am very glad he must submit. Mr. Custer assured me, that Mr. Thomson had in every instance abovementioned expressed himself with great anger and haughtiness. Mr. Thaxter, one of Mr. Thomson's Clerks who was present at the delivery of the Messages and answers abovementioned related the circumstance to Major Young, and expressed his astonishment at Mr. Thomson's extraordinary behaviour. When the Honorable John Adams was appointed a Commissioner at the Court of Versailles, the Secretary produced to me, as President of Congress, a Commission to sign for that Gentleman. I observed to him that the writing was on a single Piece of Paper, much crowded, blotted and interlined, and that he should consider the Commission was to make its appearance before the Court of Versailles, and probably before the King of France, therefore I requested him to have a more decent and correct Copy made; he replied very abruptly-I can't do it over again. I then in the mildest terms said, Mr. Thomson, I will have it copied over fairly in a good hand, and will sign it and you will have nothing to do but to attest it-he imperiously answered, I won't.(4) After Congress returned to Philadelphia I had frequent occasions to send my Secretary for attested Copies of Resolves of Congress in order to forward them agreeable to the order of the House, in several instances Mr. Thomson returned me for answer, that he had not the Key of the Office, that it was with one of his Clerks, and he did not know where they lodged-these answers were brought to me by my Secretary Major Young, who avers that in many instances which he never reported to me (5) the answers were given abruptly and unmannerly. To mark these facts as being barely disrespectful, is dealing tenderly with Mr. Thomson, because I must otherwise charge him with having entrusted all the Public Records in the hands of strangers whose very abode he was ignorant of. Some time in May last I went into the Secretary's Office and intimated to Mr. Thomson that I was desirious of taking out an old Printed Bill of the British House of Commons, commonly called the Fishery Bill, in order to extract a part of it. Mr. Thomson replied, I  cannot let any Paper go out of this Office without an order of Congress. I said, Mr. Thomson this is not an Office Paper, 'tis an old Parliamentary Bill of no use to Congress and besides here's a duplicate of it in the Desk, I will give you a receipt for this, and will return it in half an hour. Mr. Thomson answered, I can't help it, I will not let any Paper go out of the Office without an Order of Congress; a receipt will not do-well Sir, said I, this is very extraordinary, however there is another way of answering my purpose. I then sat down in the Office and copied the clause or Section of the Bill which I wanted, wished Mr. Thomson a good Morning and thanked him for his politeness. Every Gentleman will admit this to have been a mark of great and unnecessary disrepectfulness-possibly the Committee may affix another epithet, when I inform them that the Secretary has since that time suffered Papers to be taken even out of the secret depository and carried away without the permission of Congress. I could recite other instances of gross partiality and arbitrary conduct of the Secretary, but if these are not sufficient to convince the Committee that the Secretary has treated a Delegate of a State with wanton and unprovoked disrepect, nothing else will be so. The particular complaint made Yesterday, is of Mr. Thomson's affrontive answers when I requested him to let me have only two Copies of the Journal for my State which I had an immediate use for. His first answer was-I won't. I replied, you won't Mr. Thomson, what language is this? I tell you I want them for my State-to which he again answered, I won't, but added, till I have given every Member present one; Mr. Thomson then descended from the Platform; I reached out my hand to take another Copy, he snatched from me and said, you shan't have it-this repeated insult brought instantly to my mind his former conduct & provoked me to say, he was a most impudent fellow, that I had a good mind to kick him; he turned about, doubled his fist and said you dare not, I recollected the time and place and let him pass on. When he had humoured himself he returned with many spare Journals in his hands and gave me one, I barely asked him if he might not as well have done this at first. From the number of Members on the Floor compared with the number of Journals he must have known there were enough for each Member present, and each absent Member, and that for my State I had a right to at least three, according to a Rule established by himself without any authority that I know of. Admitting I had no right to demand, which cannot justly be admitted, or that I had been too peremptory in the demand which I certainly was not; the Secretary ought to have given decent answers, not insulting and irritating denials. I consider these affronts of the Secretary though offered to a Delegate, and however Mr. Secretary might have intended them, as abuses of power in Office, and affronts to that Assembly of which I   have the honor of being one, and I trust the Committee will view them in the same light, and honor the Body by doing justice to its Members.

Congress have agreed to stop the press at two hundred millions or as far short of it, as the State of their other resources will permit. In the course of the debate, I intimated my doubts of their obtaining taxes from New York until Congress shall have decided the claims of Vermont. In my opinion the full tax should be assessed and levied, because we shall never be able to raise it with so little difficulty as at present. I would nevertheless detain every shilling of it till justice be done the State, and for this purpose Congress should be immediately authorized by law to do it effectually, unembarrassed by useless and perplexing provisoes and reservations.

7793,dg013487,1779,Gouverneur Morris to the Public,"""Gouverneur Morris to the Public   [September 4? 1779] Perusing the General Advertizer of Saturday August the 14th, I (1) observe the author of a piece in it, signed a Citizen of Philadelphia, speaking of the crown's unappropriated lands, says \""the brave citizens of these States were led to believe, that if they risqued their lives and gave their present services, nothing more was ever to be required of them\"" meaning, I suppose, as he says afterwards, that, \""these lands and the King's quit rents, would render unnecessary any tax which might be laid, and prove a sinking fund of itself, sufficient to wipe off every public debt.\""(2) Without making any strictures on the injustice of some of the States appropriating to themselves all these lands, contrary to the spirit of the confederation; to the prejudice of the others, who have equally fought and bled for them; on the danger that will hereafter arise from the great superiority they will derive from the settlement of such immense tracts of territory; the evils that will accrue from opening a Land-Office at this time,-or without censuring those servants of the public who signed away the unalienable rights of their constituents, without reflection or reserve. I will give the inhabitants of the Thirteen United States of America, a calculation of the number of acres, and the value of the Crown Lands which Virginia alone claims, westward of the Alleghany mountains; for the sale of a part of which, an office is to be opened by that State, in October next, at Williamsburg. From this calculation they will be able to judge, whether or not the author was mistaken, when he says, \""These lands, and the King's quit rents would render unnecessary any tax,\"" &c.-or whether it is not an object to them of consequence sufficient to give instructions to their Delegates in Congress, to insist on the King's unappropriated Lands being sold or reserved for the benefit of the States at large? The lands Virginia claims upon the south-east side of the Ohio river, (for the sale of the greater part of which they propose to open an office next October) is contained within the following boundaries, to wit: Beginning at the West end of the Southern boundary line of the State of Pennsylvania, thence along the Western boundary line of the said State, to where it intersects the 40th degree of North latitude, thence along the said 40th degree to the river Ohio, thence down the said river Ohio to SEPTEMBER 4, 1779  where it empties itself into the river Missisippi, thence down the said river Missisippi to where the Northern boundary line of North Carolina strikes the said river, and extends Eastward from said rivers as far as the lands were purchased from the Indians, before the treaty of Fort Stanwix, and contains 40 millions of acres. Now 40 millions of acres at £40 per hundred Virginia money (the price set on the lands by that Assembly) amounts to 16,000,000 pounds, or 53,333,333 1/3 dollars. Besides which, the new county of Illinois, bounded by the rivers Ohio and Missisippi, and by a West line from that part of the river Ohio, where the 40th degree of North latitude crosses it, until it strikes the said river Missisippi, -contains upon a moderate computation 72 millions of acres, which, at 40 pounds per hundred, amounts to 28,800,000 pounds Virginia currency, or 96,000,000 dollars, so that the lands they claim and hold up for sale, without running a North West course, (as some gentlemen of that State say they have a right to do) as soon as they get beyond the West bounds of Pennsylvania, at least equals the enormous sum of forty-four millions of pounds, Virginia money, or one hundred and forty-nine millions three hundred and thirty-three thousand three hundred and thirty-three and one third dollars. What, my countrymen and fellow-citizens, have twelve of the United States done, that they should be excluded an equal participation of the lands in that immense Western country? and what extraordinary effort has the thirteenth (or Virginia) State made, that she should at once grasp and rapaciously seize on one hundred and twelve millions of acres to the annihilation of her national debt, and the creating an enormous fund for purposes yet unknown? Whilst all the other States of America, who have bled at every pore, and their very uttermost penny taxed for the exigencies of the general good, are deprived of their unquestionable and unalienable right. Look well into it! It does not require much consideration. But if it is urged in favor of Virginia, that her charter gives these lands to her, do not be amused by the machinations of interested men. I deny that they have such a charter, and I contend against their futile pre-emption. At present, however, it's enough that I state the enormity of their claim, and your essential injury, to rouse you to an enquiry, and manfully vindicate your rights and property. An AMERICAN MS not found; reprinted from the Pennsylvania Packet, or the General Advertiser, September 4, 1779. 1 Almost certainly Gouverneur Morris, who wrote several letters for the Pennsylvania Packet in 1778 and 1779 over the pseudonym \""An American.\"" See these Letters, 10:155-61, 327-29, 667-74, 11:92, 12:114-20, 146-52, 372-75. 2 Morris was here seizing an opportunity presented by \""A Citizen of Philadelphia,\"" writing in the August 14 issue of the Pennsylvania Packet, to oppose Virginia's claims to millions of acres of western land (\""the Crown's unappropriated lands\""), which she was preparing to open to sale on October I under terms of a new land office act. Although Morris clearly believed that Virginia's action was \""contrary to the spirit of the confederation,\"" and might be opposed on many grounds, he chose to emphasize fiscal  SEPTEMBER 5, 1779  aspects of the issue at this time. \""A Citizen\"" had focused primarily upon the revenue potential of the vast tracts claimed by Virginia, arguing that \""There is no necessity for an individual of the States of America, ultimately to pay one shilling of a tax for the expenses of the war,\"" and that in the meantime loans could be resorted to, since Congress could \""borrow at this moment more than forty million of livres, on the credit of the unlocated land.\"" \""It is not the citizen of these States,\"" the essayist went on to explain in a beguiling argument, \""but the emigrant from Europe that will pay the expences of the war. It is sufficient for us that we have fought: Let those who shall come from foreign climes to enjoy the blessings of that freedom for which we have contended, discharge the debt which we have incurred not more on our own than on their account.\"" Furthermore, \""Citizen\"" contended, the American claim to these lands would ultimately rest upon the common sacrifice of all the states during the war, and in this regard there was little difference between the states' claims to western lands and to the northern fisheries. \""Is it reasonable,\"" he asked rhetorically, \""that Maryland and the other States shall contend for the fisheries, in behalf of the more immediate interest of Massachusetts-Bay and other States, and will it not be reasonable that Massachusetts-Bay and other States should contend for an equal distribution of the unappropriated lands in behalf of Maryland, Delaware and Jersey, who, by an article of the confederation, are deprived of any share of these lands, for which they have drawn their swords as well as others, and which are the joint possessions of the whole.\"" In calling public attention to Virginia's \""unlocated\"" western lands and her threat to open them to sale in October, Morris was anticipating the reopening of the issue to debate in Congress less than two weeks later when the proprietors of the Indiana and Vandalia companies submitted a memorial to Congress to forestall Virginia's action, for which see John Fell's Diary, September 14, 1779, note. See also Samuel Huntington to the States, October 30, 1779.""

7798,dg013492,1779,Charles Thomson to a Committee of Congress,"""Charles Thomson to a Committee of Congress   Gentlemen,(1) Monday Sept 6 1779. It gives me the most sensible pain that any thing relating to me should at any time and more especially at the present draw your attention from public concerns. However since even one member has thought it necessary that my public conduct ought to be examined into and tried I find some consolation that, after a service of five years, two of them under the eye of my present accuser who it seems kept a strict watch over me and as he has informed the house minuted down my failings, he has nothing more criminal to lay to my charge than what is before you. Of five presidents under whom, during that period, I have had the honor to serve Congress, I flatter myself I enjoyed the confidence, esteem & friendship of four; and I deem it unfortunate that I cannot boast the same of the one who is  SEPTEMBER 6, 1779  the present complainant, especially when I recollect that no gentleman ever came to Congress, in whose favour I was more prejudiced & whose friendship I more sincerely desired to cultivate. At his first arrival and during the time Congress continued at Philadelphia in the year 1777 I think I gave him full proof of this by every mark of attention in my power not only as a delegate but as a man I wished to convince of my regard. When by the approach of the enemy Congress were forced to quit Philadelphia and remove to York I carried with me the same disposition; And when he was elected to the chair I called upon him several times to pay my respects; but the alteration I perceived in his conduct towards me and the manner in which he received my visits soon convinced me that they were not welcome and that I must for the future decline them or expose myself to insult. To what cause this could be imputed I was at a loss to guess. To ascribe it to the effects of his new dignity would have been to disparage his understanding. I was sometimes induced to think that it might have been owing to his having, soon after his election failed to make an impression on me by his attempts to vilify & lessen in my opinion the character of the late honble Mr Lynch, of whose understanding, virtue and patriotism I entertained the highest opinion & for whom I had the most sincere affection and friendship; or that he found himself not more successful in his endeavours to persuade Me that Moses the man of God and deliverer of Israel was an imposter and that he deceived the Israelites at Mount Sinai by having had a knowledge of the use of gunpowder.(2) But whatever the cause might be, I confess freely that I was of too proud a spirit to brook indignities and that I scorned to court any man however high in office, by fawning, cringing or servility. I therefore declined any farther attendance & visits of ceremony. This I presume gave mortal offence. Soon after, when by a severe attack of the cholera morbus; I was prevented from attending Congress, he seized the opportunity, and at the afternoon meeting pronounced a furious invective against me, endeavouring to persuade Congress that by some act which he was pleased to construe into disrespectful behaviour to him I meant to insult the dignity of that body of which he was president. Of this I was informed the same evening by some members, who did me the honor to call and visit me in my chamber. As I was conscious I had given no just cause of offence and could not then bring myself to think that this proceeded from a malicious intention to injure me, I imagined there must have been some misunderstanding; And therefore as soon as I recovered strength sufficient to walk, I went to Congress and waited impatiently the whole morning expecting he would have repeated his charges & called upon me for an explanation of my conduct. As he did not, I took an opportunity after the adjournment at night to mention my surprize at what I had been informed of and desired him to let me know in what I had so highly  offended as to oblige him to complain of me to Congress. He denied his having made any complaint and asked, who informed me. I told him, Some members of Congress. He said, it is a damned lie. They are damned liars that informd. The expression struck me dumb with surprize. He left the room. Turning around I happened to see one of the gentlemen who gave me the information. I repeated to him what had passed. We walked out together. The night was dark; As we passed the end of the house conversing on the subject, he had stopped and hearing our conversation, though we did not see him, he repeated aloud, It is a damned lie. I cannot say which was greatest, my astonishment or resentment. However we passed on without making reply, and I determined before I took any farther steps in the matter to consult with my friends. But in a short time after my resentment was lost in grief and amazement, when, in the midst of the public distress, I saw him at the afternoon sessions so far unmindful of his station and dignity as to rise and debate questions as a delegate, then sit down and as president hear himself replied to, and at one of those debates or altercations so far forget himself as to answer an honble member from North Carolina (3( by singing aloud, when in the chair \""Poor little Penny, poor little penny; sing tantara rara\"" And at another time when he was reading a report brought in by an honble member from the state of Massachusetts bay which was under debate, to stop in the middle of a sentence and exclaim \""Solomon gundy! Did you ever see such a solomon gundy!\"" which raised such indignation that the honble. member left the room and Congress was adjourned. Upon seeing this conduct, I took no farther notice of what had passed respecting myself determining however to be upon my guard and to give as little cause of offence as possible. This I found the more necessary as he continued by a thousand undescribable ways to teize, irritate and provoke me.(4) During that winter I enjoyed but a very indifferent state of health & had very little assistance in the office, while at the same time by the critical state of public affairs and occurrences which happened, the business of the office was accumulated to a very great degree and the sitting twice a day allowed me less time to dispatch it. This gave him many favourable opportunities which he studiously embraced to teize me with messages and sending for papers which he must have been convinced it was not in my power to have ready and which he must have known would have been sent to him as soon as finished; These messages were generally brought by his coachman James, and were commonly sent to me when I was at dinner or Supper and sometimes when I was going to bed. For it seemed to me that he carefully attended to my hours of refreshment and rest and wished me to enjoy as little of either as possible. This however I bore patiently without murmur or complaint and, I think, without shewing any marks of discontent or uneasiness; though for months together scarce a day passed without visits from his coachman James at improper   times and for the most part with messages and on business, which with all due deference to his judgment I thought at the time might as well have been dispensed with. However I took not the least notice of this, nor did I like him keep minutes of transactions as they occurred. I wished to forget them, that I might preserve some respect for a man so highly honoured by his country. And this would have been the case had I not by the present occasion been forced to this painful recollection, which I thought necessary in order to convince you that his present conduct is only the result of a premeditated and long concerted plan to lessen me in the opinion of Congress. I now proceed to the Charges. 1. (5) With regard to the affair of M Laneuville, I remember the circumstances very particularly. A comee. had brought in a report to which many objections were made in Congress. The Debates were warm and some members interested themselves so far therein as to call for the yeas and nays which was not usual except on important questions. Congress differed in many respects from their committee, which occasioned many amendments and interlineations and prolonged the session till late in the afternoon. As soon as I got home, which was some time after Congress rose as I had to stay & put up the public papers, I sat down to dinner & having finished a hasty repast I had just begun to enter on the journal the proceedings and resolutions of Congress when James his coachman \""the young man who\"" as he informs you acted as his secretary called with the president's compliments and desire that I would send him the resolutions that were passed respecting the french gentleman. I desired him to give my compliments to the president and inform him that they were not yet ready, that as soon as they were I would send him an attested copy. With this message he went and returned immediately with Mr. President's compliments and desire that I would send him the journal as he only wanted to see the resolutions. I desired him to return my compliments to the president and inform him that I had not yet quite finished the entry. Presently he returns with a message, which he delivered not in the most graceful manner in words to this effect \""The president desires you will send him the report he wants to see it as it is\"" adding \""Mr Duer and the french gentleman are there waiting and want to see it.\"" The reason of this demand I could not comprehend, and the peremptory manner in which it was delivered was far from being pleasing. I replied give my compliments to the president and inform him that I cannot send the report, it is so erased and interlined with amendments, that it is not fit to be shewn to the gentleman. Presently he came back a fourth time & knocked at the door. I went into the entry where he delivered the following message \""Mr president gives his compliments says he's much obliged and must submit\"" I said it is very well & made him a bow. If upon returning into the  room I repeated the words \""He must submit!\"" as it is not improbable I did, it was to express my astonishment at his conduct and the strangeness of the message. Mr Duer immediately after called on me and told me the president was much incensed. I repeated to him the whole transaction & shewed him the report and he expressed himself as perfectly satisfied with the impropriety of sending it. That Mr Custer might have delivered as from me the answers set down in the paper of charges I will not dispute: but surely Mr Laurens must have known that the word \""scrabbled\"" bears no marks of my language. 2. (6) As to what relates to the commission of the honble. John Adams, I cannot with all my recollection remember a single circumstance. But the answers set down are so strange and to me so improbable-especially that one who, for these five years passed or at least from the 10 May 1775 so wholly devoted himself to the business of Congress as to deny himself all relaxation and amusements scarcely allowing time for refreshment and sleep, who in that time has written so many volumes & reams of paper and who by that close attention & devotion to the service of Congress has impaired his constitution, sacrificed his health & endangered his life, should without good reason refuse to take the trouble of only writing his name-this I say is so improbable that I cannot admit the charge until better supported.(7) 3. (8) The next charge \""that I returned for answer-that I had not the key of the office-that it was with one of the clerks & that I did not know where they lodged,\"" though I do not recollect it, I admit in its fullest extent. Because for some time after Congress returned to Philadelphia the office was kept in a room of the honble Doctr Shippen's house. Mr B. P. Smith and Mr Eddison (9) attended the office & in the evening one or the other of them locked up the room & kept the key & for some days I did not know where they lodged. The mentioning these circumstances, which were true, to Mr Young when frequently sent, as is charged, for attested copies of resolves, proves that I was not accustomed to give short or abrupt answers & that I was willing to stand excused to the president for not instantly complying with his request as I was wont to do, when the office was in the house where I lived. That my answers were given \""abruptly and unmannerly\"" I must take leave with all deference to Mr. Young's opinion, to deny. I think I might safely rest it with Mr Young to testify whether on all occasions as well when he was a clerk in the secretary's office as afterwards when secretary to the president of Congress, I did not treat him with politeness and respect. I cannot say that I shewed the same mark of personal attention and respect to Mr. Custer: I treated him with the civility due to Mr Laurens' servant. I did not ask him to sit down & enter into conversation with him, but dispatched the business on which he came & sent him back with it or with an answer to the message he brought as speedily as possible, which I thought was shewing the greater respect to his master. And   even after I understood that he was employed and \""acted as secretary\"" as well as coachman, steward, butler and valet to the president and entrusted with the most secret dispatches of Congress I could not readily adopt the principles of despotic monarchies where the favour of the prince ensures honor and his pleasure levels all distinctions. 4. (10) As to the affair of the fishery bill, the circumstances as well as I can remember are as follows. That morning being afflicted with the headach I went into the office before Congress met and was Sitting at a table with my head reclined on my hand, when Mr. Laurens came in and asked for the bill. Mr Bond (11) gave him a bundle of acts & bills. He took out the one he wanted and having written something on a piece of paper delivered it across the desk to Mr Bond, then took up the bill which he had taken out of the bundle and was about to withdraw. As there had been just before a charge in the public news papers that some papers which had been deposited in the office were missing, and an insinuation that they were removed or secreted for sinister purposes, I had given strict charge to the young gentlemen the clerks in the office to observe, in delivering out papers, the orders of Congress, which enjoined that no paper be delivered without leave first obtained from Congress & then giving a receipt for the same. Lest the present might serve as a precedent for the young gentlemen to dispense with the strict line of rule, I rose up and went to the desk and finding as I suspected that the paper which the honble Member had delivered to Mr Bond, was a receipt, I told Mr Laurens that was not sufficient-that previous to a member's taking a paper out of the office the order of Congress was that leave be obtained of the house & then a receipt given. When he doubted there being such a rule or order, I called for the journal & pointed it out to him. He then endeavoured to distinguish between the paper he had taken and an Office paper & mentioned that there was a duplicate in the office. But as I could not see the distinction and was not satisfied that there being duplicates would warrant me in dispensing with the rule and delivering out one of them, I told him I could not consent to his taking away the paper. He then said he would speak to the president, and afterwards that he would take the consequences and walked towards the door. Then turning about he asked if he might not have a copy. I answered in the affirmative adding that every member had a right to a copy of any paper he pleased to demand unless there was a special order to the contrary. After this he sat down, made, as I suppose, an extract called for his receipt which Mr Bond delivered to him and then left the paper and withdrew. I had returned to the table & sat down being in great pain. When he got as far as the door he returned towards me and with a formal bow thanked me for my politeness with a view as I supposed to provoke a reply. However I returned the bow and kept silence. These are the circumstances as near as I can recollect. Mr. Bond and Mr. Eddison were both in the office at the time and may if  necessary be examined. What epithet the committee will be pleased to affix to this conduct I must submit to their judgment. As to the information that \""since that time I have suffered papers to be taken even out of the secret depository and carried away without the permission of Congress\"" I have to say that I never refused any member the free liberty of taking, without permission asked of Congress or receipt given, any paper he desired down into the Congress room or into the chamber adjoining and there reading or making extracts as he pleased until the adjournment, and I will also confess that at the adjournment several members have through inadvertence or without recollecting the rule carried papers home with them, at which I have expressed uneasiness & dissatisfaction, but that I have knowingly & designedly violated the rule will rest with him to prove. 5.(12) This paragraph hinting what he could do, I apprehend is thrown in to shew his skill in oratory and his art in wounding his antagonist by affecting to conceal or pass over charges, which he is conscious he cannot support. He has informed Congress that he kept minutes of my conduct, and by going back a far as 1778 which was the time when the transaction respecting Mr Laneuville happened he has sufficiently evinced that if he had any instances of my gross partiality and Arbitrary conduct, he would not fail to produce them. As (13) to the late affair which constitutes the last charge, I am free to declare that I had not the most distant thought or intention of giving offence to him or any other Member. I had frequently heard Mr Lovell who had a principal direction and management in printing the weekly journal and ordering the distribution, for as to myself I never took any concern in the matter as I did not consider it any part of my business. I say I had frequently heard him mention that there was only one copy for each of the members printed upon a fine paper and that if any member wanted to send copies to their state they might be supplied with an [other if] wanted out of those printed on common paper. I had heard him likewise complain that by some members taking more than one, others were deprived and by that means their setts were broken and if they should incline at the end of the year to have them bound into a volume, they must supply the deficiency with those on common paper which would disfigure the volume. For this reason when I took up the bundle to distribute among the members, Mr Lovell being absent, I determined to oblige by delivering to each member one copy. And as there were several members, and among the rest Mr Laurens, at the table when I opened the bundle I thought I paid him particular respect by delivering him one first. When he asked for another I desired him to wait until I had delivered one to each member. When he repeated his demand he did it with a tone and in a manner that I confess gave me offence and at the instant determined me to pursue the resolution I had at first taken; when he persisted and seized the bundle in my left   hand, endeavouring to take it by force, I wrenched it from him: but when he used abusive language & threatened to kick me, (14) I felt my indignation kindled to that degree, and even now the bare recollection of the indignity raises such sensations, that considering the place I am glad I had so far the command of myself as only to put myself in an attitude of defence and say You dare not. I have now lived fifty years and never before received such an insult. Whatever might be conjectured \""from the number of members on the floor compared with the number of Journals\"" the event shewed that there was not more than one for each member attending the house, for he having afterwards got another, I found there was not one left for Mr Mathews who happened to come in [too late?]. Upon the whole, gentlemen, I submit myself to your Judgment and am, with the sincerest respect, Gentlemen, your most obedient & most humble servt, Chas. Thomson ""

I am fulley persuaded much the grater part of the members of Congress wish to do Strict Justis to the army, but the Confused State of our money makes it Extreme difficult to know what to do. I am fulley of your opinion that Clamours against publick Abuses & publick measures are mostly from men that have not the good of their Country at hart, but air Activated by views to Rais themselves into importance by Sowing discord and Endeavouring to throw the Publick affairs into discord. I have not heard any Complaint against you as Quartermaster General, (but many Against the inferiour officers in your department), nither do I think their is any attack, Designed agains you; if I should discover any Such design, you may depend I will give you speedy information. The suspitions I hinted to you last summer I still Concive to be justly grounded, but flater myself that party are looseing ground in Congress fast. The attack made on me last May I am fully Convinced originated from that quarter, and went from Congress to the State, for I stood much in the way of what they Called the New England (1) intrest, and I make no doubt but Mr. S.A. & Mr. W.E.(2) will use all their influance to damn me with the People, but they may be Damd. them Selves for what I Care for them or their party.

I have inclosd you a journal of Congress least by any mistake you have not had one Sent you-you will observe the votes on July the 9th.(3) You must be the best judge of your own department and what part to act-but in a friendly maner I would advise, not to be over warm in defence of them that Act under you, but do them Strict justice and leave their defence to them Selves. Any affair in Congress that may heave up, you may Enquir of me freely, and you may depend I will inform you as far As is Consistant with my duty to the publick-if Any thing Worthy notice in the Camp a line from you would be Agreeable.

His Expressions are unusually vague-& perhaps it is only a political touch on an important String, to try the Tone of America, after the Accession of Spain to the War.

That the Memorialist, as appears by the Minutes of the Committee of secret Correspondence, dated 23 January 1776, had undertaken a Voyage to Martinique for the publick Service. That on the 22 February 1776, it was \""agreed by the said Committee that he should proceed immediately for France as an Agent of the Congress to transact such Business, and negociate such Matters as may be committed to him by Congress or their Committee.\"" That it was certified by the Committee \""To all whom it may concern, that the Bearer, meaning the Memorialist, was appointed to go into France there to transact such Business commercial and political, as the said Secret Committee had committed to his Care in Behalf and by authority of the Congress of the thirteen United Colonies: \"" That in the Sequel of Instructions given to the Memorialist by the Secret Committee he was directed \""to keep a daily journal of all material Transactions\"" in the Conduct of his Agency. That your Committee are of Opinion the Secret Comittee judged it unnecessary to give the Memorialist particular Directions to keep fair and exact Accounts of all receipts and Expenditures of Money on Behalf of his Constituents, the Keeping and regularly transmitting of such Accounts being the indispensible Duty of every Agent SEPTEMBER 9, 1779  whether publick or private, and that therefore Congress had a right to expect from the Memorialist upon his Arrival at Philadelphia, circumstancial and accurate Accounts of his Contracts if any, and a regularly-stated Account current of all receipts and Payments of Money for these States, together with Invoices and Bills of Loading for Goods shipped, and receipts or other satisfactory Vouchers for Payments made [by him]. That the Memorialist ought to have brought with him from France, and to have laid before Congress, a fair Abstract of all Engagements on Account of these States so far as he had proceeded in them, which is the Duty and the Practice of every faithful Agent acting for private Persons or publick Bodies. That no good and deciding Reasons have occurred to the Committee sufficient to convince them, that it was necessary the Memorialist should return to America in the Count D'Estaing's Squadron, rather than by a Conveyance somewhat later, after having taken the proper Steps to afford Congress the Satisfaction they were entitled to as to his Transactions and Accounts; or sufficient to justify the Memorialist in leaving his Accounts and Vouchers in France, not in the Hands of the Commissioners, and in such a State as not to be settled without his returning thither. That the Committee are of Opinion the Memorialist ought to have deposited in the Hands of the other Commissioners at the Court of Versailles, the Originals or Copies satisfactorily authenticated, of all his Accounts and Transactions as aforesaid, especially as he was duly informed that another Commissioner was appointed to supply his Place, whence he could have had no Foundation for presuming that he was to return. That there is no Evidence arising from any Vouchers produced by the memorialist that a considerable Balance or indeed any Balance at all is due to him from the United States; and that it would be highly improper to give Orders for the Payment of any such Balance in Europe, while the Claim is rested on no better Foundation. That the Committee are of opinion the Memorialist ought to be informed Congress have received the Vindications of the Honorable Arthur and William Lee, Esquires, against certain Charges and Insinuations respecting their publick Conduct published by the Memorialist in the Pennsylvania Packet of 5 December 1778; and also of such Charges, as the said Arthur and William Lee have set up against [him]. That the Comittee are of Opinion if it be consistent to detain the Memorialist, he ought to be detained, and directed to send to France for all Accounts and Vouchers of his Transactions, in Order to adjust his Accounts at the Treasury Board, and to answer the Charges set up against him by the said Arthur and William Lee, and that the said Arthur and William Lee should be directed forthwith to attend Congress as well for the final Adjustment of their own Accounts as   for answering to such Charges as have been brought against them respectively by the Memorialist, and for supporting their several Charges and Accusations against him: but if it be not consistent to detain the Memorialist, the Committee are of Opinion the generosity of Congress cannot be further extended than the following Resolution expresses which they submit. Resolved, That Silas Deane, Esqr be allowed his reasonable Expenses for the Space of Months, while repairing to Europe and there adjusting his Accounts and collecting his Vouchers for final Settlement at the Treasury Board of the United States, and returning; the said Expenses to be charged in his said Accounts.

That the Memorialist was directed in the Instructions given him by the Secret Committee to keep an exact and circumstantial Account of all his transactions of every kind from time to time, and that therefore Congress had a right to expect a fuller satisfaction in this particular than can be derivd from the Papers and vouchers Mr. Deane has produced, even under the Idea that the resolution of Congress of the 8th December 1777 was an order immediately to repair to America. 2. That it does not appear from any Vouchers produced by Mr. Deane that a considerable balance is due to him from the United States, but the presumption rather is, that if any balance is due it must be small, and many circumstances make it doubtful whether a balance is not due from Mr. Deane to the Public. That at any rate it would not be adviseable to authorize Mr. Deane to receive any balance in Europe, the final settlement of the said Accounts being to be made at the Treasury of the United States. 3. That Mr. Deane ought to be allowed his reasonable expences for Months to enable him to repair to Europe for the purpose of collecting and adjusting his said Accounts, agreeably to the Resolution of Congress of the 6th of August last.(2) The Committee therefore submit the following Resolutions 1st. That Mr. Deane be allowed his reasonable expences for the space of Months while repairing to Europe and there adjusting his Accounts for final settlement at the Treasury Board of the United States, and returning, to be charged in the state of his said Accounts.

Financiers, are Men who devise ways & means for assessing & collecting revenues. He is the best financier who points out particular subjects in his State for assessment, from whence the largest revenues may be drawn, with the least expence, & which the people will pay with the least murmuring. For taxes & murmuring more or less, are inseparable Companions. The duty of Congress is to be watchful over the expenditure of the Public Money, to call those Men in whose hands such Money has been entrusted to strict accounts at stated periods-to make an Estimate year by year of the public debt & to assign just proportions of the whole debt to be raised by the States respectively in order to discharge the whole annual Amount. It is the duty of the several States to finance, agreeably to the custom or local circumstance of each, & to assess & collect by ways & means of their own devising, the proportion of the general debt, which shall have been assigned to each & to remit such proportions into the general Treasury within stated periods.(2) Congress have in no Instance acted the Financier, except in the single article of Loan or borrowing Money. How that branch has been oeconomised both abroad & at home is known only to a few Members of this House, the rest are almost ignorant, our constituents at large are altogether so-when the burthens of Taxes fall heavily upon them, they will open their Eyes & enquire-and then-but here I draw a Veil.

A Number of Transports are fallen down SEPTEMBER 14, 1779  below the City, & it is supposed they are to take on bord about 4 or 5000 Troops destined either for the West Indies or the Southern States; Congress seem inclined to send the No Carolina Brigade on, for the defence of the Carolinas & Georgia. The Officers are in a most deplorable situation for want of Clothing none having been sent on of any consequence for their relief. The Delegates of our state are therefore reduced to the necessity of applying to Congress for a Sum of money, to purchase necessaries to Supply their wants; whether they will be able to attain such supply they are not yet certain. Should the Enemy intend an Incursion into the Southern States, Your Excellency must know much better than I can pretend to inform you, how deficient Our State is, in the Article of arms field pieces &c.

No Official Account of the Court of Madrid Intentions, has been as yet received in Congress. It is supposed Spain has had her eye on the Florida's, I think She has; & from thence are induced to believe she will make some advantagious offers to the United States-provided they will Guarantee those Provinces to her at the Conclusion of the War. This is a matter which may require great deliberation. And the question may turn upon this point-Whether it may be more for Our advantage to have the Spaniards or the English for our Neighbours. The Independance of America is we think Secured by Spains entering into the War; & nothing remains for us to do, but to keep a good Army in the field, & Support the Public Credit, & this depends solely on the Patriotic exertions of the Several States, But it is Needless for me to dwell on this great Subject as it will be so fully & judiciously discussed in the Circular Letter which Your Excellency will very soon receive.

It is a Pity they had not taken Place two Years ago. There were committed,(3) a Report I (am told will) believe will be made To Day or Tomorrow (whether it will be sufficiently explicit or pass in its present Form) is uncertain. My Endeavours [to] render it proper neither have or shall be wanting. (I am now in Congress and a very extraordinary Vote has this moment passed.(4) The Proprietors of Indiana and Vandalia, claiming a Right to the Sovereignty and Soil of a Tract of country which Virginia says is within her Lines petitioned Congress to interpose in their Behalf. On reading the Petition separate Independent Government by Virtue of certain Acts of the British King and Council previous to our Independency.)  SEPTEMBER 16, 1779  My Resolution to resign the Office of Chief Justice was taken after much Deliberation and Thought on the Subject.(5) I have since frequently examined the Reasons which influenced me to that Measure, and still remain perfectly satisfied with them, as there is therefore no probability of a Change in my Opinion, it will be unnecessary to detain my Resignation any longer from the Council of Appointment. The Legislature may perhaps in Consequence of this Step incline to keep me here. On this Head I must inform you that the Situation of my Fathers Family is such that I cannot longer reconcile it to my Ideas of filial Duty to be absent from them unless my Brother should be so circumstanced as to pay them necessary Attention. The enclosed Letter to him is on that Subject,(6) and I have desired him in Case he cannot undertake to have his Father and Family almost constantly under his Eye, to prevent my Election.

You will be pleased therefore to consider that Resignation as absolute, and to deliver it to the Governor.(3) I am now writing in Congress and therefore can by this opportunity say little. My Consent to remain in the Delegation depends on the following Contingency-If my Brother will be so circumstanced as to be able to pay constant Attention to my Father & Family, I have no objection to remaining here-but should that not be the Case, my Feelings will not permit me to be longer from him. I perceive the  SEPTEMBER 16, 1779  Consequences of this Step. It will carry out of the Road of ambition, which at present is flattering. It will also be very unfriendly to views of Interest, I having it now in by Power to provide handsomely for myself. But as I wish to have Property in the other world as well as this, and my views of Ambition extend beyond this Life, I shall invariably pursue the Dictates of what I may think my Duty, wheresoever they may lead me.

Carolina, every body who came from thence assured me you were determined to come this way very soon, as I remain in the same disagreeable state of suspense I should not have written to you now, had I not been charged particularly with a Letter from your friend Colonel Hamilton,(1) that Letter accompanied by two which I suppose to be from St. Mary Axe,(2) your Letter intended for Mr. Hutson & one for Mrs. Petrie you will receive under the present cover. I must refer you as usual to Mr. Gervais for News, but I may add, we have just recd. advice from Boston that our Frigates Boston & Deane had captured a Copper bottomed British Sloop of War; the Sandwich Packet bound from New York to Falmouth; a Vessel with 150 Pipes Wine from Madera; these safe in Port. Two New York Privateers of 10 Guns each, a very Rich Ship from Glasgow for N York & one or two other Vessels-these not yet arrived, on board the Glasgow-Man was a Box containing complete aparatus for counterfeiting our poor Dollars, which had been thrown overboard & recovered. Major Gardner, he who was on Port Royal Island, was taken in the Packet.

Sepr. 17th 1779 I have written very frequently to you, but have no Copies of the Emanations of my friendly Attachment to your merits as they have SEPTEMBER 17, 1779  at those Periods appeared on paper. But the Nature & especially the sincerity of them may perhaps be better judged of by seing what I wrote to your Non Amicals. I find that a Mr. Cummins and a Mr. Smith have been taken. By the latter I wrote in a private Capacity to all three of the Commissrs. but have only a copy of one to Dr. F____ and perhaps never sent a copy of that before this day.(1)I have ordered the Bearer of this Scrawl to deliver one to you marked 4 if you are in France, if not to break the Seal and deliver the inclosed as directed. If it comes into yr. hand, break the Seal and you will find a second Envelop properly directed, to which you may put a Wafer. If you do not get that Proof, take my Word for it that what little Health I have left unsacrificed by 17 months Imprisonment & 33 months Drudgery here, shall be exerted on every necessary occasion to defend your Name & Character against vilainous Attacks, the Spirit for which, however, has long ago become despicable. Your Choice from Salust of a Motto for one of yr. Friends came too late almost, for in a few days after my Receipt of it, quietus took absolute occupancy of turbidus inquietus atrox.(2) Dont start at the Expression of my Receipt; but know that upon reading a Letter for R H L or F L L or J L (3) I broke every Seal and by the Advice of yr. hearty friends Mr. Laurens, Gen. Whipple & others, presented the Defences, Replications, Remarks & their Vouchers, not keeping back the last half Sheet wsh. contained an a fortiori.(4) A paper unsigned, among Mr. A. Lee's Dispatches, read Sepr. 2d. (5) This was a Course of Observations upon the Correspondence relative to yr. joint papers. The Remarks upon the Employment of W____s (6) are at hand whenever that Business shall be taken up, as also are Letters between JA and Ct. V-g-ns.(7) Mr. A's Testimony in Regard to you & yr. two Brothers is manly as well as just. No Step is yet thought necessary with regard to the Affair of Sergeant & Ingersol,(8) or that of evacuating the Post mentioned by you. The moving of the Waters are closely watched. I find by a Letter this day recd. from my friend Genl. Warren of the Navy Board Boston that some Justice of Peace in the Jersies has rudely opened Letters for you & Mr. Schweighawser going from me to his Care by a Boston Gentleman who did not think of taking a Pass with him:(9) better so than to be opened by some such as you and I know who are no Justices. I believe the Letters were from R H L covered by me to Schweighauser for the Sake of telling him that I shou'd ward off the arrows of the assassins of his Son in Law's Character when any of them fly this Way. They come from awkward tho practiced Bowmen. La Luzerne does not speak English. I shall naturally be led to more Intercourse with him than his Predicessor, from that Circumstance. You see how S A & I are marked in the Company-Thing of Paca & Drayton,(10) doubtless the latter tale bore many of our Hones-  ties from the State House to the Hotel; but I cannot say that I ever discovered a consequent Manifestation of Dislike. Those Browbeatings however are never practiced against manly Indifference. Perhaps it would have been better if several of us had not, from an aversion to even the appearance of Sycophancy, left a Stranger without proper Warnings against that insidious Class. Ford has not been here. You know by my Letters of April (11) that he was judged by the State of Virginia to be not fit to be near the Person of an American Commissioner. R H L has been greatly indisposed but is mending now in his Health. I doubt whether you will by this opportunity know any thing decisive of our opinion respecting the 2 Spanish points of negociation; but you may depend on it that we are disposed to do every Thing to cement a triple Alliance whenever Spain shall signify her Wishes through you or other regular Channel. The Floridas are not ours; they belong to our Enemy. A free Navigation of the Miss'pi. is to be wished for but cannot be claimed if S_ (12) owns both Banks near the Mouth though millions of Acres of Virginia lay also on the Waters of that River higher up. Are you so munified with orders from the State of Virginia that if a Vessel with Goods sent by you for that State should be lost you will not be made to bear the whole burden? I have been told such a Thing is whispered here. Pray be on yr. Guard. Caution is what an honest Man may condescend to learn from Rogues. I must endeavor to speak a good Word for Daddy Dumas.(13) He has been very particular in the margins of the Leyden Gazette Feb. 23 to write where it respects you. \""Je nai aucune part a toute cette insertion; & je n'ai pu la voir qu' avec affliction\"". I should think he would not hesitate to tell the author of that rascally Paragraph which is in the Gazette of March 30. How wou'd the Refusal consist with his written profession above mentioned? You have had an abandoned set at your Elbow to watch over. And you made some here very rancorous at the first of yr. Correspondence. I never cou'd find by the Books of the Comtee. who the two were that you was mistrustful of.(14) The Letter Book is not signed, so as that I can see who were 2d & 5th. It will not do to take them as they stand on the Journals when elected. But if Complaisance put Franklin in the Chair I get Harison & Jay. You also once said something about Mr. Duane's Servant. An Attempt was made to embitter the Mind of Govr. Reed who happened to be a Member of Congress when the Dictionary came to light. But Mr. Reed says you did your Duty well.(15) Something in yr. Letters to the Comtee was in Cyphers. Merryweather Smith decyphered it readily otherwise I must have sent it on to Virginia to yr. Brother. I know that R H L thinks that mode is now as useless as if Deane knew it; need I say more? I think it would be clever to have a Cypher in Comtee, but not to be also used to your Brother or yr. Friend; those should be distinct ones. We have never yet got but one Treaty printed in French by Authority. I mean one  of Each which I gave to the Secretary's office. I wish to own them myself. Why should you and I fret at a Man's putting up in his Chamber the Bust of Cataline or any other Rascal, if he leaves us at Liberty to place in ours Cato, Hampden or Adams? If yr. Brother and Mr. Izard are near you deliver the Letters for them inclosed.(16) I am not become enough acquainted with those Gentlemen to scrawl away freely & carelessly to them my Resentments at the manner in which they have been treated by privite Information or public Decissions. I Esteem them both as fast friends of America and Mankind at large. I before informed you that some wiseacres affirm that a Comtee for Correspondence is useless. I have no Clerk, the Papers of the former Office lay at Random, and I am determined they shall be preserved in due Arrangement, therefore you will believe me when I say I am overplied with affairs. I fear losing a convenient Occasion of getting my Packets to the Ship if I do not now close; but will if necessary take up my Pen again before she sails to give you Information and fresh Assurance of my being, Dear Sir, your Friend and very humble Servant, James Lovell ""

(1) We are sorry for the trouble which you have had with the Conspirators belonging to the Alliance, and at this time can think of no better method of disposing of them than Sending them out to this Continent by different Vessels proportioning the number to each Vessel, so as not to render it dangerous or inconvenient; and upon their Arrival if Sufficient evidence can be had it is our intention to bring them to trial by Court Martial. We are perfectly satisfied with the manner in which you have disposed of the Alliance, and have strong expectations that the little Squadron under Captain Jones will by their Success furnish Ample funds to repay All the Disbursments that have been made for that ship. Although we are fully sensible of the perplexity which you have already had in transacting our Maritime business & of the impropriety of taking up your time from affairs of more general importance, when Consuls should be appointed at the several seaports & provided with funds for that purpose, yet the necessity we are now under of furnishing the sr.

This Ship is called the Confederacy, mounts 36 Guns, commanded by Seth Harding Esqr. who we have Ordered, on his Arrival, to transmit you a state of his Ship, and to be governed in All things by your orders as you will perceive by the enclosure. We have in veiw that this Ship on her return should bring back as much Military Stores for the use of our Army as can be provided in time so as not to detain her or incommode her as a Ship of war which we request you will order Accordingly and despatch her as soon as possible. As it is probable that the Captain, Officers and Crew will stand in need of some Supplies of Cloathing and (As they have wages due to them) a little money, we request that you will SEPTEMBER 17, 1779  Order them advances to be made, but with a sparing hand.

Should you take any Prizes and Order them to france they are to be put under the care of such persons as our Minister may direct, and such Prizes as you may order to these States are to be directed to the Continental Agent of the State in which they arrive.

This Circumstance would naturally lead you to think me inattentive; others will induce you to ascribe it to a different Cause. Exclusive of Business which I never admit or urge as an Excuse for such omissions, want of Health has rendered me less punctual in my private Correspondence than I would wish. The approaching Season will give me Health & Inclination will always prompt me to support a Correspondence with those I value & esteem, in which number I have long considered you. Your sentiments respecting the Gentleman named in your first letter perfectly correspond with my own (2) and tho I wish to see him in a Situation agreable to himself & distant from the Place of his Residence, I cannot prevail upon myself to propose his appointmt to the one you mention, which is daily growing into Confidence & Importance. My Doubts respecting this Gentleman are of long standing and arise from Circumstances which made deep Impression on my mind. I should never forgive myself if before these Doubts are removed I should recommend him to an office in the execution of which they should become fully justified. Our opinions of his Talents Disposition & Passions are the same & I am well apprized of the Consequences which wd. result from their being exerted to obtain the objects of his Pursuit. Some other mode of diverting them may perhaps offer. I have seen, respected & pitied Monsr. Neuville.(3) Considering how some of his Countrymen have been promoted, his feelings have  SEPTEMBER 18, 1779  doubtless been wounded. His Pretensions however were rather too high, & could not possibly be complied with. It gives me Pleasure to find that Fleury possesses your Esteem,(4) it will add to the share he has of mine. He stands well with the Minister, & I have punctually seconded your wishes on that Head. How far it would be proper or possible to connect him with an American Minister are Questions about which I am by no means clear; such a Step would have Conveniences, but at the same Time be exposed to several unpleasant Consequences. Republics are always jealous, seldom liberal, never grateful, and not always just, and yet I believe, all things considered, the least evil of all Governments. As to the Probability of my going abroad, it is very distant. It is one of the last things I wish for, not from any objections to the appointment simply considered would be agreable, but from the Danger to which every Man's Reputation is exposed whose advancement would interfere with the views of the most intriguing unprincipled men I have ever met with; you know who I mean. The Board of War are charged with Chevalier de Colombes affair, and will probably report in his favor;(5) for my own Part I have ever been averse to giving Brevets except in very particular Cases; it cheapens us.

It affords me particular satisfaction to find by your favor of the 4th inst. that your health is restored.(2) I hope your influence will make some beneficial changes in the politics of Virginia. I am sure your endeavours will not be wanting, and I am very sure you are convinced of the necessity of changing men if not measures. If there is as much Virtue and Integrity in a certain Assembly as formerly, there certainly is a Languor, a want of Resolution, to oppose vice, and stem the torrent of corruption that at this time threatens ruin to America, but I hope that persevering Spirit which heretofore faced every difficulty and looked all opposition out of countenance, will again revive and scatter the Cloud that now hangs over us. I expect my retirement will afford me a satisfaction impossible to be enjoyed in Philadelphia but however happy my scituation may be, it will ever be increased by hearing of the prosperity and Happiness of those worthy Patriots who first steped forward, braved every danger & combated the greatest difficulties and by their Virtuous Struggles and unremitted exertions have thus far rescued their country from the hand of Tyranny. Some of your Friends particularly Mr. Laurens & Mr. Lovell will give you an accot how matters are going on here, these Gentn. I need not tell you, are real Friends to virtue and consequently to those devoted to the cause of virtue. I must approve Dr Lee's intention to come to this Country when the Spanish business is concluded. I think it necessary he shod. have a fair opportunity of puting to shame those base assassins whose malice is wrought up to the highest pitch by a consciousness of their own inferority. If he lands in NewHampshire I am confident he will be received with the Respect due; and in some measure proportioned to his merit. I shall be particularly happy in having an opporutnity of manifesting my Gratitude for his services to America. Notwithstanding the great distance between us, I shall flatter myself with hopes of some times receiving a line from you & You may be assured I shall omit no opportunity of communicating whatever I think will give you pleasure. Please to Remember me very affectionately to Coll F. Lee. I am My Dear Sir with the highest Esteem and Respect Your Sincerely Affectionate Friend, Wm. Whipple SEPTEMBER 18, 1779  ""

I will inclose you the papers as far as we have gone if I can get them today. Mr. Gérard took his leave of Congress on Fryday last and will Sail it is said to morrow, the Count La Luzerne is on his way from Boston and is expected here in a day or two. By a Letter from the Count de Virgennes to Mr. Gérard dated the 29th of June (1) we are informed that the Forces of France & Spain were in motion in Order to Join and when the Junction was made they would endeavour to Strike such a Blow as to force England to Acknowledge our Independence. That Great Britain in Order to Avoid that hard Necessity which she will never agree too but in spite of herself and to Avail herself of an Opportunity at a future day to reduce us to Servitude had sent or was about to send Two Emissaries to Congress with the Offer of a Time and power even to withdraw all the English Forces, provided America would determine to ransome her Alliance with France and seperate herself from her, as the Minister at Paris calls them Emissaries we may suppose they will come in a private manner (for I dont find that they are yet come) and carry on their Appro[a]ches with great Secrecy 'till they can discover what effect the fascinating charms of new Coined Guineas may have on the Virtue of individuals. I hope they will not find a man of influ- SEPTEMBER 20, 1779  ence & power in any of these States so lost to public Virtue & patriotism as to engage in the Sale of his Country for a Mess of Potage, all those with whom I have conversed speak of this matter with abhorance!

But I will not harbour the Idea, the Virtue of America that has carried us so far through this Contest will not now submit to Temptation. The Marquis La Fayette writes to Carmichael that the Grand Fleet of France with a large Army on board Transports had sailed for Ireland, what think you, do they mean to Conquer it or to give Freedom and Independence to that Country, whatever their Views may be they will distress Britain and that Affords some pleasure from the consideration that it will hasten a disposition in her to give us peace.

If I can obtaine the particulars you wish to be informed of, respecting the New Minister, before the post goes off, you shall  SEPTEMBER 21, 1779  have it, if not expect it in my next. Our loss of men at Penobscot is not yet known, no doubt it will be considerable, and as to Ships it may be said to be allmost total, as but one escaped most of them were burnt by our own people, I believe the Eastern people are asshamed of that expedition which is the reason we have never yet had a particular account. Inclosed you have a Circular Letter from Congress to the States, which will fully informe you as to our Emissions &c.(1) This day Congress goes into a Committe of the whole to consider of ways & means for supplys to carry on the War, at present they have in view a requissiation on the States for Taxes & Loans to an amount that I am affraid will not be complyd with. I was with a very small Minority on this grate question for stoping the Press, not that I thought the measure rong, but that it was necessary first, that the State should engage to furnish supplys, I shall be very happy to find I was mistaken by the several States furnishing their Quotaes as requested by Congress, which requissian you may expect next week. Your Acco' of the Emigration, from our frontier Counties are very allarming and the measures pursuing in Virga of disposing of their Lands at this critical time I think should be put a stop to, but I see no inclination in Congress at this time to take it up. I am not disappointed on learning that the Law intended to put a Stop to Ingrosing &c has not had the wisht for effect.

The subscription to Dunlap's paper I think is 80 dollars by the year, I shall not order that matter untill you again write me for the purpose. I fancy the Enemy will attempt nothing great notwithstanding the arrival of Arbuthnot. I wish we could know with Certainty to what place the Regiments lately embarked from N. York are intended; perhaps the Count D. Estaing may fall in with them, the Count having quitted his former station. I am almost as sanguine as yourself that the present Campaign will finish the Contest; the opposition to Great Britain is very formidable indeed; and yet when so conspicuous a nation begins to fall, perhaps SEPTEMBER 21, 1779  she may go on to the brink of destruction, and of consequence the war may be lengthened a considerable time to come. The resolutions of Congress relative to the Army were but so many Acts of Justice; and I hope the different states will provide half pay exactly conformable to the English establishment. (1) Congress have done and are doing all they can to appreciate the money; yet the states and Individuals can alone apply the most effectual remedy by loaning and taxation. Enclosed you will find a handsome address upon this subject; written by our president;(2) it contains to my Judgment a great deal of sterling sense and the most solid reasoning. I do not absolutely condemn your associations: but perhaps in consequence of them you may want many comfortable private supplies. I shall take notice of what you mention about the adjutants, paymasters, and Clothiers, I thank you exceedingly and General M.(3) for a sight of those papers enclosed to his Brother.(4) They greatly expanded my Ideas upon the subject; our officers write and fight in the same spirit. Your circumstantial account of that affair has given me pleasure tho I feel exceedingly for your situation-and yet w[hen] the public are acquainted with the whole matter as more praise will be given you as the brave and fortunate officer who executed the command.

Yesterday we finished our Ultim[ata] (1) but still there is a minister to be ballotted for which may occasion some further delay as the Members of Congress differ in Opinion as to the person. On the 11th Inst. Sailed a fleet of Transports from New York under Convoy of a 64 Gun Ship. On board this Fleet were three Regiments, two of Hessians and the other the 44th Compleat made so by draughts from other Regiments. Where these Troops are destined is not known but supposed for the West Indias or Georgia. Congress have not yet received the particulars of our Loss at Penobscot which I believe was as severe as it could well be.

7866,dg013560,1779,Henry Laurens to John Laurens,"""Henry Laurens to John Laurens   Philadelphia 21st September 1779. I had the pleasure my Dear Son of writing to you the 17th Inst. by a Public Messenger, & of receiving on the l9th by the hand of Capt. Roberts your favor of the 9th Ulto. This Young Gentleman will dine with me to morrow, if I can render him services more substantial than bare civilities, your recommendation will have its weight, with my own feelings respecting him as a fellow Citizen the Son of a valuable Officer who laid down his Life in the defence of America.(1) I knew, the pride & the naughtiness of the Hearts of so many of our fellow Citizens, would seduce them to spurn at the mode you speak of for completing our Confoederal Regiments; that the avarice of others would impel them to revolt from the proposition for erecting black Battalions & I long since foresaw & foretold you the almost insurmountable difficulties which wou'd obstruct the progress of your liberal Ideas-nothing wonderful in all this. Is it a light work to bring Men accustomed to [great?] affluence & absolute command, to submit without murmuring to peremptory Orders under the penalty of Corporal punishment? And it is certainly a great task effectually to persuade Rich Men to part willingly with the very source of their wealth &, as they suppose, tranquility. You have encountred rooted habits & prejudices, than which there is not in the history of Man recited, a more arduos engagement. If you succeed you will lay the corner stone for accomplishing a prediction of your Grandfa- SEPTEMBER 21, 1779  ther & your name will be honorably written & transmitted to posterity. But even the attempt without perfect success, will, I know, afford you unspeakable self satisfaction. The work will at a future day be efficaciously taken up & then it will be remembred who began it in South Carolina. I prospered yesterday in carrying through a Report which I had the honor of presenting to Congress from a Committee appointed to correspond with General Lincoln, recommending Aid to So. Carolina by dispatching three frigates or Armed Ships of War & the North Carolina Brigade to Charles Town; there was much opposition to the measure from certain quarters & the Report underwent some alterations which may possibly be made use of to defeat my views, but as the execution was Committed to the Marine Board where Mr. Mathews acts as a Member, I have strenuously recommended the subject to his attention & I confide greatly in his zeal & fortitude.(2) Should we receive certain accounts of a French Fleet operating on your Coast, all that we have here determined to attempt for your relief will instantly be reconsidered & probably vanish. Gentlemen aver that the Continental Frigates [work?] no advantage to the Port of Boston either in a Commercial & pecuniary view, or as a defence-on the contrary the Prizes which those Frigates carry in, work a prejudice to the Citizens of that Town by encouraging monopolizers & extortioners & by stripping the Port of Seamen who would otherwise be more usefully employed in the service of [ . . . ] Merchant Ships & private Ships of War. This doctrine strange as it may appear to Men of no more than common understanding, is proved & illustrated by the extreme reluctance with which Gentlemen representing Massachusets & Boston consent to part with them only for a few Months in favor of a much distressed Sister State, but when some Men talk of defending So. Carolina & of the necessary measures for recovering Georgia, methinks I hear blind Men describing Colours, or Misers haranguing on liberality. Has not So. Carolina contributed her quota to the raising a Navy? Has she not a rightful claim to some of the benefits which may be derived from the Navy? Oh! but So. Carolina is defended by taking the Enemy's Privateers from New York, & if you send our Frigates to So. Carolina the Enemy will soon know it, way lay & capture them-do not the Enemy as well know when those Frigates sail from Boston on a Cruize for prizes? is it not as practicable for British Men of War from Hallifax, Rhode Island & New York to waylay them coming out of, & returning to, the Bay of Boston as going to Carolina or cruizing from thence? did not they know of the ill concerted enteprrize to Penobscot? Had I prevailed by my repeated recommendations more than twelve Months since, to send three Frigates to Cruize near Charles Town we should probably have added three or four British Frigates to our American fleet &c, &c. It has been falsely transmitted to Charles Town that I was too  closely connected with the Eastern States, you have now proof of the contrary & I glory in the reproach of being with no Man, with no party longer than he or they steers or steer by the Pole Star of reason, Justice, reciprocity.(3) When Men diverge into the Road of self Interestedness, I walk no further with them. In a word, I fear I have given offence to some of my friends. If it be so, I can't help it, I would rather offend my Father than meanly or wittingly transgress against those principles. The offended will upon reflection, perceive their mistake & without suit forgive me nor will this be a strange Phoenomenon in a true account of my Pilgrimage. How many of our Confederal Ships of War have heretofore been Captured or foolishly lost? but how many have been captured or otherwise lost in attempting to releive or aid the Southern States? answer, my friend, these questions fairly & you will see nothing preposterous in the proposition for sending three Frigates to Charles Town-if cruizing be your Plan they will have as good Cruizing ground from thence as from any port on our side of the Atlantic & Boston will be for a little time relieved from the burthen of Prizes. My very worthy friend General Whipple, says in his mild & decent manner, well! well! you'll repent this scheme. But I'll say no more. I know my views are pure, my design is to promote the general good of the Union & I trust we shall be all good friends to morrow. My quandam opponent Merryweather [Smith] to whom I never made any approaches, is now not only pleased but kind pressed me to day to take a side of his Chariot, brought me home & will eat Sturgeon with me to morrow-look at the Journal of Congress the 14th May last, &c.(4) If Men will be if they will do these things, how can I help it? I will not be ill-natured or inexorable. But to return to your Letter, I expect soon to hear your schemes in Assembly have proved abortive & that you have been defeated in your first battle in the Field of Politics-should this be the case I wish indeed to know it soon, & to know also your determination respecting a continuance in your native clime, in order to regulate my own movements. I should begin my journey homeward in a few days were I sure of meeting you on the Road or at Ansonburgh, meaning in a few days after two or three important points shall be adjusted in, as honest Mr. Duffield (5) stiles it, the great Council of these States. I have informed Monsieur Girard of Mr. Plombard's (6) addresses to your Senate & House of Representatives & given him proper extracts from your Letter & from Colonel Gervais's, if the Gentleman has been misled I am in hopes he will see his error & retract before it be too late, he must not expect undue countenance either from Monsieur Girard or from the Chevalier La Luzerne. You talk of a heavy tax, what will you say when Congress shall call on you for about a million & an half of Dollars per Month, a call which you must expect to hear [ . . . ] the 1st November. We have solemnly pledged ourselves to [issue] no more Paper Money when   the Amount shall be 200,000,000 Dollars, as you will have read in the Circular Letters. This event will happen about the 1st December & we have not yet determined upon one article of ways & means for replenishing the Treasury & carrying on the War. I feel more from [this present?] prospect of our affairs, than is convenient to ma[rk on?] Paper, lest Rivington should lay his hands on my Letter & magnify. I am told Colo. Laurens gives exceeding good Madeira Wine to his guests at the House in the Garden, whence I presume it must be plenty & cheap in Charles Town, therefore I request him to lay in a Pipe or two for me before Christmas. Colonel Malmadi will be the bearer of this,(7) I don't know whether I shall be able to write to Mr. Gervais by him, if I do not, I pray you let this Letter do you both, & if I send but one Packet the News Papers will be found in that. I commend you to God's protection & remain My Dear son, Your faithful friend & affectionate Father, Henry Laurens ""

Mr. Langdon being  SEPTEMBER 21, 1779  taken with very fierce Symptoms on Monday, Genl Whipple put off his Journey home intended to have been on that day. Resolves have passed respectg. the main one of the two Questions asked us in Augst, if not in April 1778 and again in Octr with Information that A.L. would not think himself authorized to treat on those Points with Spain without our special Direction.(1) But lo! now, their is an Intention to send the Answer to A.L's Question to Doctr. F or to somebody to be appointed. So that the 4 to 4 & 4 divided is probably to be a resumed Question.(2) I am prepared to inform new Members and to make the old ones sin with Conviction before their Eyes, if they are bent upon sinning. My opinion is that, if De Vergennes wrote on Octr. l9th 78 (3) that he \""feared Mr. Lee & those about him\"", yet that he pd. so much Regard to the Testimony given by Mr. J. Adams on the 11th of Feby and will be so desirous of confirming his own Assertion made a few days after \""that he had none of the Prejudices endeavored to be excited in America\"", that he will treat A L with Confidence, and even be anxious to repair the Injury connected with former Diffidence by super rogatory Complaisance in future.(4) If a Slight is to be in this Instance put upon A L, I will proceed in two Peices of Business which I have suspended; one of which you mention in your Letter,(5) and the other I have before hinted to you. I hope that the one you mention is not talked of in your Quarter. For, tho' I have maintained a Right of Suppression of what is sent thro the Discretion of a private Friend by a public officer, yet I do not want to have a noisy Discussion of the Question. I will attend to what you say about Flour though I think it a desperate Plan to send it from hence in Waggons unless in Cyder Barrels. Perhaps I shall get some on the other Side of Hudson's River which will save many miles Risque. We are struggling very hard about our money. Gerry will not have a Tooth or Nail left if several whimsical Financiers do not go home soon. He is truly anxious to have something decisive done, and he labors at it Night & Day.

When I left Congress last year a System of Finance was then nearly compleated; & was afterwards finally so. But soon after, those who did not like it, took the opportunity of moving a reconsideration of the whole & succeeded, which set the whole plan afloat again, & before anything effectual could be done upon it Congress were apprised of the mediation of Spain, to bring about a peace, between Britain, France, & America. This necessarily led them into a discussion of points which were proper to be insisted on as the Ultimata for peace. This single object (I may justly say so, for no other business of importance was done) engrosed the attention of Congress, from the ninth day of February, untill sometime about the beginning of August.(2) To find things in this situation, no less chagrined, than astonished me, which produced from me some Phillippics not very pleasing, & which I really believe in the end had a good effect. You are doubtless no Stranger to the grand obstacle to the completion of this business, to Wit, the fisheries. The New England States had got some others to join SEPTEMBER 21, 1779  them in a determination to make no peace, unless Britain acknowledged their right to an equal participation of the fisheries on the American coast. This Subject was twisted, & tortured, in all the variety of modes human genius could invent to gain & to oppose, this important object. I took the opportunity when this point was warmly agitated, to deliver my sentiments fully & freely on it. I had taken pains to inform myself of the progress & the state of the business, and had well considered the importance, & consequence, of the claim, & was prepared to decide on it. I was a fresh hand. No man knew my sentiments, & [every one] listened with avidity to hear on which [side I should d]etermine. It was [. . .](3) and grievously distressed country, for reasons too well known to be herein mentioned. Here the matter rested, the question was taken, & finally decided on. This relation looks too much like ostentation, to be communicated elsewhere, I mean it only for yourself, as I know your indulgent friendship will induce you to make me all the necessary allowances. This matter then being settled, the State of our money called loudly on us to pay a serious attention to it. But the precious days, & months that had been spent on the last mentioned business, were never to be recalled, with this wanton waste of time, was our money as wantonly sported with, untill it was at last reduced to its last stage of annihilation, when the alarm bells from all quarters din'd so incessantly in our ears, that we were at last roused by its call. What was to be done? resounded from all parts of the house. Stop the press was replyed. This expedient was taken hold of & after a mature consideration was resolved on. No alternative remained, one more emission must have struck it dead. The nominal depreciation was thirty for one, This made the value of a dollar no more than three pence but in fact it was no better than One penny. Thus by Congress spending Six months on a business, which at a very large allowance, ought not have taken more than one, & for this object neglecting all others, we are reduced to this horrid dilemma. Whilst lounging in their seats, they could by a single vote, call forth Million after million from the press. They gave themselves but little concern, what was to be the event, untill ruin stared us in the face. Then by inspiration every member was at once to rise up an able financier. Thus when the Patient is gorged almost to suffocation, The faculty are called to a consultation. One sett prescribes lenitives to make him disgorge by degrees, as too violent an operation at first would probably throw him into convultions. Another is for craming him still more, by which means it will make him thrust it out at the other end. The third is for giving him a strong emetic, & oblige him to cast up the whole at once for as the disease is desperate it must require a desperate remedy. I am among the latter class of Quacks (I think like Doctor Rock's, our motto should [ . . . ] Quack, Quack). Let us [ . . .1st . . . ](4) experiments will never do, for it never produced above a tenth part of what was necessary for the annual supplies. 2d. Stuffing one   end to force it out at the other. That is, emitting more money. Even a Quack can tell this must be instant death, for one more emission would strike dead the farther circulation. 3d. The strong emetic, to produce a copious discharge. That is, a heavy tax. Now as I take you to be full as good a Quack as I am, I will leave you to Judge, which of the three remedies you think most likely to succeed. My plan always was to procure money in Europe & draw bills for it, either to pay of a part of the debt incurred here, or keep it as a fund for carrying on the War, at the same time tax the people as far as they could bear. Thus we should have been enabled either to pay of a part of the circulating cash, by which means the farther emissions would not have been so much felt, or by appropriating it, for our immediate expences, would have stopped the press & brought the paper money to a fixed value, which was certainly a most desirable object. But the day for this, is now past. Our Great Politicians say we ought by no means to incur a larger foreign debt than is indispensably necessary & that only in procuring Arms, ammunition, & Cloathing for the troops, which cannot be procured here-Our only resource now is taxation & internal loans. Let us examine the practicability of this method's producing a sufficient Supply. There remains to be emitted of the 200,000,000 a Little better than 40,000,000. There is a tax of 60,000,000 already called for, & which is to be paid in by the first of January. There is a negociation on foot for an internal loan 20,000,000. This makes in the whole 120,000,000. Deduct for the nonpayment of the Quota of So. Carolina 5,000,000 Say of the bills of April & May paid in by way of taxes 20,000,000-in the whole 95,000,000 remains. This is Computed to carry us on to the first of March next. What are our monthly expenditures? 15,000,000. Don't stare so. If you look so aghast now, what will you do before I am done. I Say 15,000,000. This for the Six months up to the first of March is 90,000,000. Thus far it is all plain sailing. Then it devolves on the States to Supply the Continental Treasury. By an Allotment of 15,000,000 [ . . . ](5) the New England fashion. All the Eastern & Middle States Say it is. Virginia & North Carolina Say they think not. So. Carolina Says No. You'll of course ask, how I can [ . . . ] adopt the plan then. I'll tell you. I voted first for stopping the press, because I saw no alternative, & I must be in favour of this plan because I can suggest no better. A poor reason you'll say. True-But the principle I go upon is this. The farther emissions being stoped will bring the money to a fixed point, & prevent the farther depreciation. There being such a superabundance in circulation, the people are eager to lend their surplussage, provided they could be certain of receiving their own money again. (The direct contrary of which has hitherto been the case.) This point being fixed, they will not only be certain of receiving their money at a future day, of the same value as when they lent it, but a chance of it's being better, because as the depreciation has been arbitrary, owing to the constant emissions, the emissions  being stopped, there is a great probability of the depreciation being brought down to the true principle of depreciation, that is, as 30 is to 200, not quite Seven for one. Again when the money lenders see such heavy taxes called for, they will begin to think Congress are seriously disposed to sink the money (which the people have of late entertained doubts of) & the man of property finding such a run upon him for the payment of his taxes, will begin to feel that the money is of value. All these things co-operating will induce the money lenders to bring in his money with cheerfulness. Then supposing the four New England States, Jersey, Pensylvania, Delaware & Maryland, to bring in their quota's, this will be about one half, Then what can be borrowed by the United States & the several States, I conclude will make up the sum wanted, besides, it is to be supposed the States of New York, Virginia, No. & So. Carolina, will pay in some part of their quotas of taxes. None of the States plead inability but the impracticability of a monthly Assessment. So. Carolina can with propriety plead inability to pay so heavy a tax, Yet I hope she will exert herself to the utmost stretch, to do all she can, for I am now thoroughly convinced nothing remains but to pay freely, heavy taxes [ .... ](6) For alas! What is our European foe now reduced to. That imperious, vengeful, insidious people, are driving headlong to the Devil as fast as they can go. I believe a more infernal crew, never infested the earth Since Noah's flood. A fairer prospect of Peace, happiness, & every blessing this world can afford, never presented itself in stronger colours, to any people, than to those of America, & if that Virtue & Patriotism, which inspired our early resistence is not Culled into too profound a sleep these enjoyments will all be ours in a few months more. There wants nothing to insure it but putting our money on a respectable footing, for a failure of this, is the only hope now remaining to our scoundrally enemy, and against it they are now bending their whole force, by every art, however mean or infamous. Let men only consider for a moment what the tax is, it is no more than so many three pences, & not dollars. Let me intreat you my worthy Friend (remember I don't write to you now as a governor) to endeavour to reconcile our people to the measure. I know the burthen will be oppressive but it cannot be avoided. Every thing depends on the success of the plan. If it obtains, our troubles are at an end, if it fails. Oh! Think what must be the consequence. I will Say no more. I have already detained you very long, the subject was truely interesting, which I must substitute for my apology. I should be much obliged to you for your sentiments fully on this subject, in answer to mine, & whatever else you can suggest, for I shall rely much on them.

I refer you to a plan we had formed for your relief, to a letter I wrote Ed.

7876,dg013570,1779,Charles Thomson to Thomas Mifflin,"""Charles Thomson to Thomas Mifflin   Sir, Philada Sept 22. 1779 Agreeably to your request I have made the necessary enquiry,(1) the results of which is as follows. Newhampshire has not yet established its constitution. The government is executed by a president & Council. The President has no Settled salary; but grants are from time to time made to him, the whole of which did not in 1778 exceed 4000 dollars. This present Year it is thought it will be something more. Massachusetts Bay is in the same situation with Newhampshire. The constitution is not settled. The Executive business is carried on by a President and Council. The President the eldest Councellor and is only primus enter pares. He has no emoluments annexed to his Office; and by the last grant is allowed in like manner as the other Councellors 10 dollars a day. Rhode Island continues in the exercise of its ancient form of government. The governor is elected Annually. His salary as governor is about 300 dollars a year; But as governor he is Naval Officer and enjoys the perquisites of that office paying the necessary clerks. This was formerly judged to be worth about 1600 dollars a Year. Connecticut likewise continues in the exercise of its ancient forms. The Governor is annually elected. His stated salary is 300 pounds  SEPTEMBER 22, 1779  lawful per Annum. Besides which he has been allowed for extraordinaries from 100 to 150 Pounds a Year. In May last the Assembly agreed to give him for the current year on account of the depreciation twelve for one, which is 3600 pounds lawful money equal to 12000 dollars. New York has new modeled and settled its constitution. It has a Governor. His salary is 2000 pounds or 5000 dollars per Annum, On account of the present times, the Assembly have added one thousand pounds more or 2500 dollars. So that he is now allowed 7500 dollars for the present year. He has no house allowed him, nor any perquisites. New Jersey have also new modeled their constitution. They have a governor. I have not been able to find what his salary is. He has been allowed, the present year, something on account of the times. But his whole present allowance is supposed not to exceed 3000 pounds or 8000 dollars per Annum. Delaware has new modeled its constitution. The chief Magistrate is a president who is annually elected. His salary is 200 pounds or 533 1/3 dollars a year. I do not find that he has any perquisites or that he has had any allowance made him on Account of the depreciation. Maryland has new modeled its cons[t]itution. The chief Magistrate is denominated Governor. His Salary is 2500 pounds or 6666 2/3 dollars a year. But lately the legislature unwilling to set an example of raising Salaries, and at the same time unwilling that the Officers of government should suffer too much by the depreciation, have resolved to pay the reasonable expences of all the Officers of Government. Virginia has in its new constitution established a governor. His salary is 4500 pounds or 150[00] dollars per annum. He resides in the palace [& has] the use of the Stables & a piece of pasture ground thereto belonging and also of some furniture which in 1774 cost 1500 pounds or 5000 dollars. I do not find that any allowance is made on account of depreciation. North Carolina under its new constitution has a Governor. He has no fixed salary. In the present state of the currency he is allowed 15000 dollars a year and has some trifling perquisites, but he finds his own house. South Carolina has new modeled its government. It has a Governor. His salary is 2000 pounds or 5333 1/3 dollars. He enjoys no perquisites, has no house found for him, nor has he had any allowance made to him on account of the present depreciation. With regard to Georgia, there is no person of whom I can enquire concerning it. I am Sr, Your obedient humble Servt, Chas Thomson ""

Soon after my Arrival here I found the following Objections to an interference with Vermont generally prevailing. 1. That Congress being instituted for the sole Purpose of opposing the Tyranny of Britain & afterwards of establishing our Independence had no Authority to interfere in the particular Quarrels of any State. Hence all their former Resolutions on the subject were merely negative. 2. That the confederation had not yet taken Place, & that the Business should be postponed till all the States had acceded, an Event then daily expected. 3d. That it was an improper Season to interfere, and that the Attention of Congress ought not to be diverted from the general objects of the War. 4. That harsh measures against Vermont might induce them to join the Enemy, & encrease their Force. 5. That they possessed a strong Country, were numerous, warlike & determined, & that more force wd be required to reduce them than could be spared from the general Defence. These were some of the ostensible Objections-Besides which I had Reason to suspect the following private ones. 1st. That divers Persons of some Consequence in Congress and New England expected to advance their Fortunes by Lands in Vermont. 2d. That Vermont acquiring Strength by Time would become actually independent, & afterwards acknowledged to be so. 3d. That being settled by New England People & raised into Conseqence by New England Politics it would be a fifth New England State and become a valuable Accession of Strength both in & out of Congress. 4. That ancient Animosities between New York & New England naturally inclin'g the former to side with the middle & southern States, the less formidable she was the better & therefore the Loss SEPTEMBER 25, 1779  or separation of that Territory was rather to be wished for than opposed. These and many other Considerations of the like Nature induced me to postpone bringing on the Matter till I could have an opportunity of preparing the way for it by acquiring a Knowledge of the Characters then in Congress & ca. It is also proper to observe that the House was for the greater Part of the Winter so (distracted &) heated by Party Divisions on Points of great general Importance that it would have been improper & imprudent to have called upon Them to decide on this delicate Business till more temped and Calmness had taken Place-when these began to appear the Subject was introduced, and you have had a Copy of the Resolutions proposed by New York on that occasion. (1) Against them all the Objections before mentioned operated-with the additional one that it would be highly unjust & impolitic to determine against Vermont without previous Inquiry into the Merits of their Claims & giving them an opportunity of being heard. This Objection so far as it respected their claim to Independence was absurd tho plausible-but it was not to be overcome-And tho we might have carried a Resolution against it by a Slender Majority that Majority would have consisted of southern Members against a violent opposition from New England & their adherents. A Resolution carried under such circumstances wd. rather have encouraged than disheartned Vermont & was therefore ineligible. Hence I conceived it to be expedient to promote the measure of appointing a Committee of Inquiry (2)-knowing that if Congress proceeded to inquire it would be a Ground for pressing them to go further and determine-especially as I was apprized that the Result of these inquiries would be in our Favor. The Committee you know had no formal meeting-it nevertheless had its use. The individual Reports of the Members who composed it advanced our Cause, and even Mr. Witherspoon who was and is suspected by New York, made representations in our Favor. Your last Resolutions were of infinite Service by evincing the Moderation, Justice, & Liberality, and at the same time the Spirit of the State,(3) on the other Hand the law of Vermont for whipping, cropping, and branding your Magistrates made an Impression greatly to their Disadvantage. Before these Emotions should have time to subside, as well as in obedience to our Instructions, I pressd Congress from Day to Day to adopt such Measures as the public Exigencies called for, and thereby prevent the Flames of civil War from rage. It would not I believe have been difficult to have obtained what some among you would call very spirited and pointed Resolutions, but wh in my opinion would have been very imprudent ones, because among other Reasons they wd. not have been unanimous.   You will find the Recitals and particular Resolutions numbered in the Margin of the Copy herewith enclosed, from 1 to 13. (4) I shall trouble you with a few explanatory Remarks on each of them- under Heads numbered in like Manner. 1 & 2. These Recitals were inserted to shew the Reason why Congress now proceed without the Report of the Committee, after having resolved to postpone the further Consideration of the Subject till their Report should be made. 3. This Recital jutifies the Facts set forth in your Representations, and in Case an appeal to the public shd become necessary, may be used with advantage to New York. 4. This Recital destroys the Doctrine that the union (independent of the Articles of Confederation) had no other object than Security against foreign Invasions. 5. This recital is calculated to impress the People with an opinion of the Reasonableness & Policy of the Requisition or Recommendation which follows, and therefore will the more readily induce these States to adopt the Measures recommended to them. 6. You may enquire for what Reasons I consented to this Recital, as it puts Massachusetts & New Hampshire on a Footing with New York whereas I well knew that New York alone had a Right to claim Jurisdiction over Vermont. My Reasons were these-Vermont extends over Connecticut River into the acknowledged Jurisdiction of New Hampshire-as to Massachusetts, the Recital admits only her Claim, not her Title-and it is as Impossible to deny the Existence of Claims when made as it is to prevent them. Their Delegates pointedly asserted & insisted on the Claim of Massachusetts, and it appeared to me expedient to provide for a speedy Determination of all Claims against us, however ill founded. You may further ask why Vermont was Made a Party? The Reason is this that by being allowed a Hearing the Candor and Moderation of Congress may be rescued from Aspersions, and that these People after having been fully heard may have nothing to say or complain of in Case the Decision of Congress be agt them-of which I have no Doubt. 7. It is true that by this Resolution the Merits of former settlements with these States will be again the Subject of Inquiry, Discussion, and Decision-and therefore it may at first Sight appear improper-but these Settlements will still remain strong Evidence of our Rights however objectionable they may be represented to be by those States. Nor will Congress be easily prevailed upon to annul them, because in that Case all their Boundaries would be afloat. Besides in my Opinion it is much better for New York to gain a permanent peace with their neighbours by submitting to these Inconveniences, than by an impol[it]ic Adherence to Strict Rights, and a Rigid Observance of the Dictates of Dignity & Pride remain exposed to perpetual Dissensions and Encroachmt. Peace and estab  lished Boundaries under our Circumstances are I think almost inestimable. 8. The reason for this is assigned in last sentence under the 6th Head. 9. For the same Purpose of preserving the Appearance of Equality in Claims, whatever difference there may be in Titles, the three States are mentioned in this Recommendation. The object of it is a Settlement of all Disputes respecting interfering Grants, in Case Vermont should be abolished, and that District in Part or in the whole adjudged to either of the three States. 10. I am sure you will admit my Prudence in giving your voice for this Resolution. 11. As it was not absolutely certain that New Hampshire and Massachusetts would pass the Laws in Question, and as I was sure that New York would, It appeared to me highly expedient to provide by this Resolution that the Dispute between New York and Vermont should be determined, whether the other two States came in or no-And least the former Guarantee contained within 10 Resolution might be construed to be contingent and to depend on the Event of all the three States adopting the Measures recommended to them, it is here repeated. You will observe that neither of the three States are to vote on the Decision. 12. On the Plan of hearing Vermont this Resolution however inconvenient became indispensable. Care however has been taken in it to exempt every Person from their Jurisdiction who profess Allegiance to either of the three States. But you will say Why to the three States-Why not to New York only from whom they revolted and under whose actual Jurisdiction they last were? Because it would have clashed with the Equality of Claims before mentioned, and the least opposition to which wd. have prevented these Resolutions from being unanimous-a Circumstance in my opinion infinitely more valuable than the Preservation of useless Etiquette. And further Because the District is here so described as to extend over the River and affect New Hampshire. In a Word the necessity of the Resolution was so obvious that there was no avoiding it. Its Inconveniences will be temporary and if the Principles laid down in it are observed will not be very great-especially as Congress have determined a Violation of it to be a Breach of the Peace of the Confederacy, and have declared their Resolution to maintain it. 13. This Resolution needs no Comment the Policy and Justice of it being extremely evident. Anxious to avoid a Moments Delay in sending you these Resolutions I have not time by this opportunity of adding any thing further than that upon this occasion I have acted according to the best of my Judgment after having maturely considered and well weighed the Force and Tendencies of every Consideration and Circumstance affecting this great Business in Question. When I first recd. my special Commission I did not appre-  hend that this Matter was in a more positive manner confided to me than to my Colleagues, tho some of them considered it in that Light. The Commission vested me with no further Powers than what any other of your Delegates possessed nor was any Matter given more particularly in Charge to me than to the others by the Legislature. Their late Instructions however speake a different Language. I am satisfied to be viewed in that Light, that is to be the responsible Man, & provided the Measures I adopt are not thwarted I am confident that I shall be able to bring all these Matters to a happy Conclusion. I hope however that this will not be considered as a Hint for my being continued in the Delegation. I assure you nothing but an adherence to the Resolutions & Principles of action I adopted and professed at the Commencement of the War, would induce me to remain here at the Expense of Health as well as property, for tho I shall always be ready to serve my Country when called upon, I shall always be happy to find it consistent with my Duty to remain a private Citizen. I am Sir, Your Most Obedient Servant, John Jay P.S. I forgot to mention that Mr Phelps has been enoculated, & therefore could not be the Bearer of the Dispatches.(5) Be pleased to advise to this Distinction between Laws & Resolutions, and that the former are preferable in the general Estimation. I have very often been asked why our Legislature passed Resolutions rather than Acts for quieting Possessions in the Grants. Some suspected there was Finesse in it. E N C L O S U R E. In Congress 24th Septr 1779. 1 Whereas on the first Day of June last Congress by a certain Resolution, reciting that \""Whereas divers applications had been made to Congress on the part of the State of New York and of the State of New Hampshire relative to Disturbances, & animosities among Inhabitants of a certain District known by the name of \""the New Hampshire Grants\"" praying their Interference for quieting thereof did resolve \""that a Committee be appointed to repair to the New Hampshire Grants & enquire into the reason why they refuse to continue Citizens of the respective States which heretofore exercised Jurisdiction over the said District; for that as Congress are in duty bound on the one hand to preserve inviolate the Rights of the several States, so on the other they will always be careful to provide that the Justice due to the States, does not interfere with the Justice which may be due to Individuals. \""That the said Committee confer with the said Inhabitants, & that they take every prudent measure to promote an amicable Set-  tlement of all Differences & prevent Divisions & Animosities so prejudicial to the United States\"" and did further resolve \""that the further Consideration of this subject be postponed until the said committee shall have made report.\"" 2 And whereas it so happened that a Majority of the Committee appointed in pursuance of the aforementioned Resolutions did not meet in the said District and therefore have never executed the Business committed to them, or made a regular Report thereupon to Congress, Ordered that the said Committee be discharged. 3 And whereas the animosities aforesaid have lately proceeded so far and & risen so high as to endanger the internal Peace of the United States which renders it indispensably necessary for Congress to interpose for the Restoration of quiet and good order. 4 And Whereas one of the great objects of the Union of the United States of America is the mutual Protection and Security of their respective Rights. 5 And Whereas it is of the last Importance to the said Union that all Causes of Jealousy & Discontent between the said States should be removed, and therefore that their several Boundaries and Jurisdiction be ascertained and settled. 6 And whereas Disputes at present subsist between the States of New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay & New York on the one part, and the People of a District of Country called New Hampshire Grants on the other, which People deny the Jurisdiction of each of the said States over the said District; and each of the said States claim the said District against each other as well as against the said People, as appertaining in the whole or in part to them respectively. 7th Resolved unanimously, That it be and hereby is most earnestly recommended to the States of New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay & New York forthwith to pass Laws expressly authorising Congress to hear & determine all Differences between them relative to their respective Boundaries in the mode prescribed by the Articles of Confederation so that Congress may proceed thereon by the First Day of February next at farthest. 8 And further that the said States of New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay & New York do by Express Laws for the Purpose refer to the decision of Congress all Differences or Disputes relative to Jurisdiction, which they may respectively have with the People of the District aforesaid, so that Congress may proceed thereon on the said first day of February next. 9 And also to authorise Congress to proceed to hear & determine all Disputes subsisting between the Grantees of the several States aforesaid with one another or with either of the said States respecting Title to Lands Iying in the said District to be heard and determined in the mode prescribed for such Cases by the Articles of Confederation aforesaid: And further to provide that no Advantage be taken of the Non-performance of the Condition of any of the   Grants of the said Lands, but that further reasonable Time be allowed for fulfilling such Conditions. 10 Resolved unanimously That Congress will and hereby do Pledge their Faith to carry into Execution & support their Decisions & Determinations in the Premises in favour of whichsoever of the Parties the same may be, to the end that permanent Concord & Harmony may be established between them, & all cause of uneasiness removed. 11 Resolved unanimously, that Congress will on the said first Day of February next proceed without Delay to hear & examine into the Disputes & Differences relative to Jurisdiction aforesaid between the said three States respectively, or such of them as shall pass the Laws before mentioned on the one Part & the People of the District aforesaid who claim to be a separate Jurisdiction on the other; And after a full and fair hearing will decide & determine the same according to Equity, and that neither of the said States shall vote on any question relative to the Decision thereof. And Congress do hereby pledge their Faith to execute & support their Decisions & Determination in the Premises. And Whereas it is essential to the Interest of the whole Confederacy that all intestine Dissentions be carefully avoided & domestic Peace & good Order maintained. 12 Resolved unanimously That it is the Duty of the People of the District aforesaid who deny the Jurisdiction of all the aforenamed States to abstain in the meantime from exercising any Power over any of the Inhabitants of the said District who profess themselves Citizens of or to owe Allegiance to any or either of the said States: But that none of the Towns either on the East or West side of Connecticut River be considered as included within the said District, but such as have heretofore actually joined in denying the Jurisdiction of either of the said States, and have assumed a separate Jurisdiction, which they call the State of Vermont. And further that in the opinion of Congress the said three States afore-named ought in the mean time to suspend executing their Laws over any of the Inhabitants of the said District except such of them as shall profess Allegiance to and confess the Jurisdiction of the same respectively. -And further that Congress will consider any violences committed against the Tenor, true Intent & meaning of this Resolution as a Breach of the Peace of the Confederacy which they are determined to keep and maintain: And to the end that all such violences & breaches of the public Peace, may be the better avoided in the said District; It is hereby recommended to all the Inhabitants thereof to cultivate Harmony & Concord among themselves to forbear vexing each other at Law or otherwise & give as little occasion as possible to the Interposition of Magistrates. 13 Resolved unanimously, That in the Opinion of Congress, no unappropriated Lands or Estates which are or may be adjudged forfeited or confiscated Iying in the said District, ought until the final Decision of Congress in the Premises to be granted or sold.  Ordered, That Copies of the aforegoing Resolutions be sent by express to the States of New York New Hampshire and Massachusetts Bay, and to the People of the District aforesaid; and that they be respectively desired to loose no time in the appointing their Agent or Agents & otherwise preparing for the hearings aforesaid. The aforesaid Resolution being read over and a Question taken to agree to the whole, Resolved unanimously in the affirmative. Extract from the minutes. Cha. Thomson, Sec'y. ""

7894,dg013588,1779,Henry Laurens to Jonathan Trumbull Sr,"""  Henry Laurens to Jonathan Trumbull, Sr. Dear Sir, Philadelphia 26th Septr. 1779. On the 12th Inst. I had the honor of receiving Your Excellency's Letter of the 6th together with the several Papers referred to in a list which came inclosed.(1) The french Papers were immediately put into the hands of our public translator,(2) the work being long he detained it five days, as soon as he returned it, I gave notice to Congress that I had received such dispatches from Your Excellency & should beg leave to present them the next day. When that day arrived I found it impracticable to obtain a reading & patient hearing & so the next & the next Congress being anxiously engaged either on the Vermont or foreign affairs to the exclusion even of public dispatches-I then judged it necessary to consult the Honorable Mr. Huntington on the expediency of detaining Mr Brown. He was with me clearly of opinion, he ought to be dispatched because we could discern no prospect of introducing the Papers properly before the House in any certain SEPTEMBER 26, 1779  reasonable time. I had therefore intended Mr. Browne should have gone away early yesterday but from a variety of public calls I could not accomplish my wish. I rose this Morning an hour before day & am now writing by Candle light in order that he may begin his journey early. Paper printed in low dutch is in the hands of a Gentleman for translation, who intimated that it will be a work of some days, when this is done all the Papers shall be offered to Congress & afterward returned to Your Excellency, when I shall endeavor to reply particularly to such parts of the Letter abovementioned as from necessity I am obliged to pass over at present. The Packet for the Baron van der Cappellen will go in the Frigate Confederacy committed to the care of Mr. Gérard to be forwarded agreeable to Your Excellency's desire. Your Excellency may freely command me in everything in my power for forwarding the inclinations of Mr. John Trumbull, but I don't think there's an opening for him in a public Character abroad,(3) & were he my Son I should dissuade him from an attempt of that kind in the present temper of the times-I might have said, distemper. Last Night I received advice by Express of the arrival of Count d'Estaing with 20 Sail of the Line, 10 Frigates, & 5000 Landforces on the Coast of Georgia & So Carolina, Gen Lincoln was in motion for cooperating with the Count & there was a prospect of capturing the Enemy at Savanna & Beaufort, or at least of scattering them in confused flight through the Woods toward East & West Florida, even the latter will be an high advantage to us & bring disgrace on them in the Eyes of their Savage connections, who will probably take part against them in their disaster. The season of the Year, the beginning & middle of September, is rather against the Count, he had determined to remain in that enterprize but a few days, whence I presume we shall hear of him in this Neighborhood early in October. Yesterday arrived here a prize Armed Brigantine of 14 Cannon & upwards of 70 Men lately commanded by a Lieutent. of Sir George Collier, captured by the Pickering of Salem & also a Transport Ship with about 300 Hessians, taken by Capt. Taylor in a private Ship of War of this Port. These added to other late Marine successes will nearly balance our very unfortunate Penobscot account. Congress will this day (Sunday) Vote for a Minister Plenipotentiary for negotiating in due time Treaties for Peace & Commerce with Great Britain; the Candidates are only two, Mr. John Adams & Mr. President Jay, if I penetrate bosoms there will be no choice unless Mr. Jay shall think & act as I would on such an occasion. \""I hear there be divisions among you\"" who can read the Yeas & Nays & not \""believe it\"" at least in part. From the beginning I wished to explode those Yeas & Nays, which Your Excellency seems displeased with. The State from whence I came, at a time, directed their Delegates to call for them on every Vote. The Call is certainly   right & useful on some occasions & Men will choose for themselves, sometimes they are held out in terrorem & the menacer will appear afterwards desirous of expunging. When I detect a Cunning Crafty Man in this trick, I baulk him-being called for & taken let the prompter & his produce appear before his fellow Citizens. A heavy weight lies on my mind from a consideration of the wretched state of our Paper Currency, Congress determined a fortnight since & more to make no Emissions beyond 200,000,000 Dollars, we are verging fast to that amount, yet not one solid step trodden in the Road of future ways & means for replenishing our Treasury & carrying on the War, we have in my humble opinion inverted the order of things, made that an harbinger which in wisdom ought to have been secondary, will the Chapter of accidents again relieve us? God only knows. I dare not detain Mr. Brown a moment longer therefore I must for the present take leave by assuring Your Excellency that I continue with the most sincere Respect & Esteem, Sir, Your obliged & most obedient servant, Henry Laurens ""

7897,dg013591,1779,Henry Laurens to John Laurens,"""Henry Laurens to John Laurens   My Dear Son. Philadelphia 27th September 1779. I writ to you the 21st Inst. by Colo. Malmadi. The 25th your favor supposed to have been penned the 7th reached me, & announced the arrival of Count d'Estaing on the American Coast, if the Count has adhered to his Resolution of remaining with you only eight days, 'tis to be apprehended his achievements in Georgia & So Carolina will not excite a nine days wonder; that slackness in our Militia which you complain of, is very illy fitted to the Count's spirit for enterprize & celerity-be this as it may, I expect, at least, this good effect from his appearance, that the Enemy will scamper off & overturn the Wright government in Georgia & all its appendages, & I hope for greater things. Congress have authorized General Washington to Co-operate with the French Admiral & General in such manner as he shall judge conducive to public good without applying to them for further directions & have strongly recommended to the middle & eastern States to give the General all possible aid of Men & Provisions & also to furnish Provisions of flour &c for the use of the Fleet & Army of our Ally. That Assembly met yesterday for the sole purpose of appointing a Minister Plenipotentiary for treating with his Britanic Majesty on Peace & Commerce, an Act which in my estimation is extremely premature. Mr. Adams & Mr. Jay were nominated, the Ballots twice taken without effect-1st Ballot 5 for Adams, 4 for Jay, 3 states divided-2d, 6 for Adams, 5 for Jay-South Carolina divided. My Colleague had laboured hard two days for carrying a resolution to disqualify any Member of Congress or any one who had been a Member within nine preceeding Months for any office of trust or emolument under Congress-I opposed the Resolution but coincided in the Idea & wished it might be understood by the whole House that a Member should not be appointed, among other reasonings my Colleague in favor of his Motion had urged, that the appointment of a Member to be a foreign Minister would be degrading; by sending one from sovereignty into servitude-you can't suppose I SEPTEMBER 27, 1779  could hear such sentiments & forbear laughing inwardly-finding me to be clear in his opinion that on the present occasion we ought not to appoint a Member, he earnestly requested me to think of a proper Character out of doors, after some hours reflection I named to him Mr. John Adams as a Gentleman in every respect well qualified, against whom there could be no exception & to whom these States were much indebted-there rested the matter, until the proposed Resolution & its proposed amendment were ousted by Yeas & Nays. When the Ballots were about to be taken, my Colleague declared for Mr. Jay, I expostulated with him on what had passed between us; observed, that among other motives, I had nominated Mr. Adams on his own principles & candidly & honestly declared to him such exceptions against Mr. Jay as neither himself nor any Man could remove. He nevertheless persisted & South Carolina was deprived of a Vote. I explained to Congress in terms nearly as above written the ground of our division as an apology for my own conduct. I think no honest Man will censure me, nor would I have it understood that I mean to censure Mr. Mathews, we are perfectly good friends & I believe him to be a very honest Man. I am also persuaded he had not been let into the secret of his self-denying motion, but this must be reserved as a subject for a future moments discussion. (1) These things I say to you & to my good friend Gervais, & to no body else, unless you shall find it necessary, which I hope will never happen. Mr. Solikifer has just informed me, that Sir Charles Hardy's Cruize had been made for reconnoitering & scouring the British Channel, finding it clear, he had returned into Port & immediately after, a fleet of upwards of forty Sail of Merchant Men, probably under some small convoy sailed from Spithead or some port in England, these were more lucky than Sir Charles, they fell in with the french or perhaps the combined Fleets, & were every skin of them conducted into Brest-this, Mr Solikoffer says he read in a Letter from Bourdeaux 42 days old & he is gone to look for the Letter, if it comes in proper time you will receive an extract. When I writ to Mr. Gervais yesterday (2) I held my self confined to a moment & said I should not write to you, but a violent rain & other circumstances I suppose were impediments to Mr. Down's departure earlier than this Morning. You will now be so good as to present my Love to my friend & communicate these contents. I learn your black Air Castle is blown up,(3) with contemptuous huzzas-a Man of your reading & of your Philosophy will require no consolatory reasonings for reconciling him to disappointment. I pray God to bless & protect you. Henry Laurens. ""

Two Things are to be transacted with Britain, a Major & consequent Minor,(2) as soon as her Madness & Folly begin to subside. But only one Agent is to manage them. The Commissions are drawn and Instructions also. The Blanks are to be filled. Doctr. F____ (3) was nominated, out of order. This led one Man (4) to suggest that he should find himself obliged when such a Nomn. shd. again be attempted, and done in order to follow it with the Nomination of Doctr. L____ (5) as a much more suitable Character, which he would endeavor to make plain by various Testimonies in his Possession part known & part yet unknown to the Assembly. A Question was then moved by a Gentleman in that Company named Mathews & seconded by one named Lovell (6) that no Member, while there acting, or for nine months after, should be elected to a place for which he or another for him recd. &c [i.e. a salary etc.]-by Yeas and Nays the nine months part was lost and the other part by the previous Question. J Adams was nominated by Mr. Laurens & J Jay by Mer. Smith. Adjurned to meet on the next day (Sunday) at 10 oClock, met; baloted, 5 for J A, 4 for J J, 3 could not agree. On a 2d Tryal 6 for J A, 5 for J J; one could SEPTEMBER 27, 1779  not agree. The mover of the motion above not being likely to consent with his Colleague to carry it into effect, The baloting was postponed.(7) It had been frequently pressed on the members to order some Resolves now on the Table, and but very lately passed (respectg. points on which the temper of Spain towards us greatly depends) to be forwarded to the Commissioner at that Court, as answers to the Questions which he hinted to us in 6 days after the Treaties with France, again on the 2d of Apr., again plainly & urgently for our Answr. on Augst. 27 again more urgently on Oct 19 again on Decr. 5th &c. &c.(8) A cut and dried Commission such as must pass hereafter was produced, moved for & seconded out of order. A motion was then made & seconded for chusing a Minister plenipotentiary to do exactly what a Commissioner is now fully authorised to do; as much so, exactly, as were the 3 at the Court of France. The Pretence for this was the accepted 2d Paragraph of a Report-vid Apr 15th that Ministers plenipotentiary were only necessary at Versailles & Madrid.(9) The Spirit and Intent of which Paragraph lay in the word only and not in a technical use of Ministers as setled by France and us on the Arrival of Mr. Gérard. Some good and not young Men, on this question, saw not the Trap under the Chaff. Who could deny that we have assented to additional parade & expence in a Minister above a Commissioner? Who could deny that two Persons would be in pay, for a time, at once, to do the same business? Who could deny that A. Lee's compleat Vindications were on the Table of Congress? This last Matter and all characterising was said to be untimely, as much as in a question about creating a Quarter Master General when we had a Quarter Master; for that A Lee stood as fair for nomination to the new Commission as any Man else, and then we should be allowed full Liberty to speak to Character. A Majority can thus kill but it requires seven to make alive. But seven thus killed. For, Mr. Laurens tho' he spoke against the Question voted for it, and then nominated A Lee. This last act of his in such a desperate case does not make up for depriving a much injured man of the advantage of showing that he was artfully knocked down by six upon a presumption that seven could not be found to assist in recovering him from the Violence of the Blow.(10) Mr. J. Adams was also nominated for Spain by Mr. Paca, Mr.J Jay by Mr. Mercer of Virga. This Accommodation Scheme had been proposed in Whispers early in the Morning, to provide places for the two nominated the day before. One to have a Post of the highest honor, and the other to take the Post of a Man murdered on purpose to make Room.(11) Are not these doings a compleat Appendix to the Report of the Comtee of 13 and the proceedings thereon months ago? Look at the Names! Here I must join in an old Exclamation of F. L. L (12) when he had seen a whole day wasted. \""What d-d dirty Work is this of Politicks\"" !

7899,dg013593,1779,James Lovell to Richard Henry Lee,"""James Lovell to Richard Henry Lee   Confidential Monday 27th Sepr. 79. The Vote for appointing a minister plenipotentiary in lieu of a Commissioner to negotiate a Treaty of Amity & Commerce with Spain having passed as I have shewn, and A Lee being nominated with J Adams & J Jay, I produced the two Letters of which I send you Copies,(1) for the purpose of showing the Appeal of the Count de Vergennes to his own manner of Behavior towards the Commissioners jointly & seperately as the Test of his not having adopted the Prejudices which were apparently attempted to be inspired into America. This appeal on Feb 13 after such a Testimony as Mr Adams's had  SEPTEMBER 27, 1779  been presented shows either that the Count had not really been afraid of Mr Lee and those about him or that he had become sensible his Fears were ill-grounded. I performed this last Act of Friendship or rather Justice to a cruelly injured man and then left the Body to proceed on Business with only entreating for due Weight, to be given to the abundant Proof which is on the Files of the execrable Falsehood of Viliany of the Assertions and Innuendoes which had been made & published for the Purpose of blasting the Character of the virtuous & faithful Commissioners now in nomination as a Minister plenipotentiary. The Baloting was called for first for a Minister for Spain, with Intent to put J A there; but it being found that the prudent Class were too prudent indeed for that, the Plan was changed to J J for Spain and the crowning act of all Deanes base arts took place. N. Hamp. R. Is Mass A. Lee Pens Conn Sth. Car N Yk No Vote N Jer. Del. Dickinson Mary Virg N Car J Jay A Minister for Peace J A only nomination all the votes except one for Doctr.

And now, my dear Sir, I shall strive to lay aside all my Anxieties about your Brother. He ought instantly to come over and do himself all that Justice before the World which his Patriotism will permit. I cannot at present see how he will accomplish it without exposing to Censure more than Wretch who raised the Flame that has so long been burning here. Yr. Brother will be able to tell that he sent his Resignation in Time; But, that his Friends, conceiving no capital Injustice would be done him after the full Vindication against all Deane's Slanders had reached Congress, chose to Suppress that Resignation,(4) by which, otherwise, Congress would have been kept from adding Iniquity to Transgression. Your Letters of the 12th & 18th as well as Col. Frank's of the 10th reached me to day. I cannot particularly acknowledge the letter myself but beg you to give Love to him & communicate what you please of my Informations to him, only using the Precaution to seem  both of you to be ignorant till you acquire the Knowledge from Emanations of the glutted malice of a Set who almost say they were sent from yr. Quarter for this sole Purpose. They certainly act zealously in their mission if such it was. I have proceeded on the powers but nothing decisive will be concluded till Tomorrow Evening. I wish Arthur may get some Item of these Things before Gérard carries the whole Budget I have so much to write to Boston that I must now bid you adieu, with an Assurance of being very affectionately Yours.

I shall write only a short closing Speculation as Rowland.(5) Many Vouchers may be used honorably in a Law Court which cannot be in a News Paper. The best Way is for all the Friends of the injured, at this Period, to be silent, unless the opposite Party shall give fresh occasion. I will speedily attend to what you want but I suggest to you the Propriety of my getting Fooke (6) to translate all the french Vouchers which may be wanted so that he may swear to the Translation.

7900,dg013594,1779,Henry Marchant to Horatio Gates,"""Henry Marchant to Horatio Gates   Dear Sir, Philadelphia Sepr. 27th. 1779 I was honored with yours without a Date-whereby I am so happy as in some good Measure to have my Apprehensions, of the Dangers your Post was in, removed. I hope however You will readily excuse a Sollicitude dictated by the sincerest Regard to your Interest and Honor, and the Prosperity and Happiness of my Country. I read from my Place in Congress that Paragraph in Your Letter respecting the gallant Talbot, but the reading of His Letter to you was unnecessary as a similar one from Him to Congress had been read. Col. Talbot stands high in the Estimation of Congress. The Difficulty was how to promote him in the Way his Talents seem to call for. A Resolution was moved for & carried for granting him a Commission in the Contl. Navy, with Instructions to the Marine Comee. to furnish him a Vesell as soon as in their Power. In an Hour or two after that Resolution was passed-Providence seemed to provide for Him, Information was recd. that a very fine Copper Bottomed Brigg was carried into Boston by two of the Contl. Frigates. The Marine Comee. have ordered that Vessell to be purchased for Col. Talbot-which I hope he will accept of, if she is as described-For at present Congress have it not in Their Power to give him a better Vessell. I would not wish to see him in private Service. Money indeed he may get there, but Honor & Promotion is only to be had where he is, and if he now should quit it, he perhaps quits it forever.(1) Your Intelligence of Count De Staing's Approach was very agreable. We have had Dispatches from him to the French Minister dated off Savan[na]h and informing that an Attack was to be made in Conjunction with Genl. Lincoln upon the British in Georgia the 9th Instant. The Count is soon to be expected to the Northward. Genl. Washington is fully impowered to consult with the Count & the Minister of France (under whose sole Controul the French Fleet is while in America) upon such Expeditions as shall most conduce to the Interest of the United States and the Alliance. I should Apprehend as the Season is so far spent, that an Attack upon Rhode Island will be more eligible than New York. Success agt. the one will be very probable, agt. the other at least doubtful. Besides I think it a Matter of Great Importance that a good Harbour should be gained as soon as possible for the French Fleet, for their largest Ships. The Harbour of New York will not do this. I presume the Count's own Inclination and Judgment will have great Weight. And I should think, for the above & other Reasons He will be for proceeding directly to Rhode Island. If Genl. Washington should be clearly of this Opinion, I presume he will put Troops forward immediately for your Post. Congress have sent forth Resolutions to the States Calling upon Them, to give every Assistance in their Power upon this inviting Prospect of Striking a Decisive Blow upon the Common Enemy. SEPTEMBER 27, 1779  It is said a second Division of Arburthnots Fleet is arrived at New York, with some Hessions & Wild Irish Troops. About sixty Sail were seen going into New York-Some Ships of War, & large Trasports . A large Embarkation it is also said has been taking Place at New York with Waggons &c &c-Some presume for Virginia, to regain the Convention Troops-an Object perhaps not out of their Reach, if Count DeStaing was out of the Way. Monsr. Gérard is not yet gone, but has taken Leave of Congress in a private Audience. The New Minister has not yet been recd. Nor is the Day appointed. A few Days must give Us important Advice from Europe And a few weeks in the Close of this Campaingn may be big with Events. That They may be Honorable & Happy to Us & Our Country, is the sincere Wish of Yr. Friend & Servt. Hy. Marchant P. S. You must receive Scratches from me-I have not Time to copy. ""

The new Minisr. plenipotentiary, with his suit, arrived here on Tuesday last; I have had the honor of paying him my respects & congratulating him on his safe arrival; and he particularly noticed the kind treatment he had received in Masstts. I consider it as a favorable circumstance, that his first arrival was in our state. Mr. Gérard, has taken formal leave; & I expect the Chevalier De La Luzerne the new Minisr. will soon be admitted to a public audience with Congress.

I have the Honor to be with the greatest respect, sir, your most obedient servt. S. Holten P. S. The disputes between the state of New-York & the people stiling themselves the state of Vermont, have arisen to such a height that Congress have been obliged to interpose (to prevent a civil SEPTEMBER 28, 1779  War) and have come into a number of Resolutions, which I suppose will reach you (by express) before this. (1) Therefore, I can't but think, that if we have any Just claims to that Country, or any part of it, that it would be adviseable to refer the matter as proposed by Congress, and endeavour to support our claims; I consider it, as unnecessary to hold up the many distresses to which we should be exposed, if a civil War shou'd take place, while the common enemy is within the Country. Yours as before, S.H. Sepr. 29th. 1779 The Post not setting out yesterday as I expected, gives me an oppertunity of adding. Congress have made choice of the Honble. John Adams Esqr. Minisr.

You will have heard of the arrival of Count d'Estaing near Georgia & South Carolina, if the weather favored him we shall in a few days learn the effect of his operations in that quarter, by himself, 'tis highly probable he is now in our vicinage.

You will have heard before this day of Count d'Estaing's arrival near Charles Town South Carolina, that operations against the Enemy at Beaufort & Savanna were in hand; I expect every hour to learn of some important event in that quarter, probably the first intelligence will be brought by the Count himself who may be daily expected at Sandy hook or Rhode Island. Our Commander in Chief is properly authorized to co-operate vigorously with him. The Season of the Year was much against the Forces of our Ally to the Southward, a few days easterly wind with autumnal Rains would blast our prospect but I hope the weather has favored them. Inclosed herein you will find a general account of three days work, it will be an exceedingly painful task to recite by & by the particulars, I shall make no comment, I have acted one uniform & consistent part, dictated by Conscience for the good of my Country as well as for doing justice to a meritorious Individual-my wishes are not accomplished, I am nevertheless persuaded the day will come when that injured Individual will receive both Justice & honor from his Country.(4) By the next Post I shall determine whether to leave Philadelphia this winter, & you shall if I determine to go, be informed precisely the day. At present time will not favor me to pay that respect to your favors now before me which is due. I must hasten to the square Room where I often meet many crooked things. I pray God to bless you & entreat you to be assured that I continue with sincere Respect & Esteem, Dear sir, Your obliged & obedt. servt. Henry Laurens. P.S. We have advices to be relied on that the 2d Division of Arburthnot's squadron 7 Ships of War having under Convoy Transports containing about 4000 Troops arrived this day se'nnight at New York.(5) The Troops are said to be \""wild Irish\"" & Hessians.

7909,dg013603,1779,Henry Laurens to William Whipple,"""Henry Laurens to William Whipple   Dear sir Philadelphia 28th Septr 1779. The present delightful weather presents to my view, my good friend General Whipple in his usual chearfulness & serenity, ambling forward toward Boston & Portsmouth, this will overtake him at the former. Our hopes of hearing in a very few days of the arrival of Count d'Estaing on the Coast of New York or at Rhode Island has induced Congress to countermand the orders given for dispatching the Frigates at Boston to South Carolina,(1) hence your Commission on the purchase of a Pipe of Wine will be stayed. I must defer that scheme to a future day. You will read in Dunlap's Paper what is said of the Count in Charles Town, to this I can add, that General Lincoln left that Town on the 7th Inst. & took with him Colo. Laurens to whom he has given the command of the Light Infantry. Every necessary measure was in motion for co-operating with the forces of our Ally, Colo. Laurens intimates that it will be our fault if we fall short of a great stroke upon the Enemy at Savanna & Beaufort. The Commanding Officer having learned of the proximity of the French fleet had detatched a Captain, a Lieutt. & 8 Men in an advice Boat with orders to Colo. Maitland to withdraw his Troops about 900 British from Beaufort & retreat to Savanna. That Boat with the Officers & Men were taken by Captain Detreville of our Artillery, that Captain had been stationed at Pinckney's Island for the purpose of such interceptions, this which I have mentioned was an extremely fortunate one; Colonel Maitland will have been more fortunate if he escaped from complete capture, but we must wait with patience for events, you know I am not of the sanguine tribe. The season of the Year was much against the Fleet, three days strong Easterly wind & heavy  SEPTEMBER 28, 1779  rains would dash all our hopes. 500 of the Virginia Troops had passed through So Carolina & were in a fair way towards Savanna. Upon the whole there is infinitely more reason to hope than to despond. Inclosed with this you will find a general history of three days, some of our friends at the Corner House may give you the particulars, which indeed would be a tiresome recapitulation.(2) Mr. Gérard I suppose will leave us to morrow but if the Minister for treating with Spain means to accompany him which I think very probable, he will dole away three or four days at Chester. Our friend Arthur Lee will rise again. God bless you my Dear General I wish you every happiness & assure you with great sincerity of the Love & Esteem of Your obedient & most humble servant, Henry Laurens [P. S.] The several interlineations renders it unnecessary to tell you I have written in haste, but I was determined, to write, as they say in this Country, \""anyhow\"" rather than not write. You will not shew the inclosed Paper to any but the faithful. 12 oClock. A circumstance has happened which obliges me in honor to pause before I make the intended transmission-a Gentleman just now brought me his hand in such terms as have softned me to him as a Man to a Man-altho no terms nor terrors could soften or warp me toward any Man connected with measures which appeared to me improper.

Suffer me now, dear Sir to assume the Freedom of giving you some Advice. Yr. Honor is among my very interesting Concerns. Having in preremptory Langu[a]ge declared my Opinion of your duty to accept, I will most ingeniously tell you every objection against it in my mind, and then advise you how to lessen the force of those objections. You will have decided ultimata and negotiable propositions to carry with you. The whole world knows that the latter are almost totally dependent upon antecedent Secresy. But such has been the Servility of some here that I have little doubt of the Knowledge of our Transactions having been regularly conveyed to our Ally already. This is not a fatal Circumstance, as both He & the Mediatorial Powers must, of Custom & Necessity, be made more or less acquainted with them by you. But there have been at Times such Declarations of the Rights of the  Delegates of a sovereign independent State to convey to their State matters respecting its Salvation, tho ordered, here, to be on secret Journals that I have little Simple of the whole of our Proceedings being known to (Virginia, New York, 5th Carolina as well as to Drayton, Jay e Smith) several States as well as to all their Delegates. In your Answer, therefore of ACCEPTANCE, I advise you to hint delicately the Disadvantages which you are entitled to apprehend from the Nature of the Constitution of the Supremacy which prepares yr. Instruct[ion]s, the Risque you foresee of your own Discretion being impeached in Consequence of the Want of it in some one or many others, and, at best, of yr. Abilities as a Negociator being evidenced in fine only by the bare Execution of the strictly defined parts of the Business proposed to you. You may conclude your ACCEPTANCE with saying as many fine Things about yr. Integrity as the vainest Rascal on Earth coud do, and, I promise you, a Syllable of what you utter on that Topic will not be disbelieved by THE DELEGATES in CONGRESS of the UNITED STATES of AMERICA. Should the State of Mass. incline to keep me here, at a most enormous Expence to them, tho to the Starvation of my Family, I will be as true to you as to John Jay. And I assure you I herein make a bigger Promise than your Observations upon the general Run of the Children of Adam will at first lead you to imagine. I will aim to know possitively the author of the Letter respecting Monsieur l'Ami d'un Fol. I will deliver to Dr Rush & Genl. Roberdeau yr. Lettrs. to them. And, now, then, (as G Morris elegantly begins his Paragraphs) my esteemed Friend, having tried your Eyes almost as much as you do every Body's, I have mended my Pen and enlarged my Alphabetic Conveyancers, for the sole Purpose of advising you to do often the same, especially when writing to public Bodies.

There will very probably be some Charges that will not finally be allowed. We will do all in our Power to procure an Order on the Treasury at Rhode Island for a Sum amounting as near as may be to our Ballance; But we are so doubtful of Our Success herein, that we would wish the State not to build much upon it. Great will be the Calls for Money-And great must be the Exertions of the States. The Time is come when we are called upon to fulfill the Engagements which every One most chearfully made at the Begining of this Contest. We must part with some Share of our Interest, to save the Rest. And if we are obliged to sell some Part of our Estates, to secure the noblest Cause on Earth who is the Man that will shrink from the Tryal. Our Grand Exertion in freely giving and lending, will under the kindness of Heaven, put our Affairs in a State of Security beyond the Reach of Our Enemies to injure.

When the Assembly appointed me a Delegate to Congress,(1) it afforded me that Kind of Pleasure only, which every Man must naturally feel, who is honour'd with the Confidence of his Country. I accepted of the appointment with reluctance, because I thought, at that critical Moment, it was necessary to commit a Trust of so much Importance, to Men of the most distinguish'd Abilities, & Integrity amongst us; but finding our first Characters unwilling to engage in publick Business, I determined at every Hazard to contribute my Mite, towards compleating the great Object in View, which we have hitherto supported with so much Firmness, & which I hope we shall in the End obtain. The contracted Sphere in which I have moved, makes it impossible that I shou'd render any essential Service at this particular Time. I have been long enough in Congress to know, that it requires Men of extensive Knowledge, as well as of unshaken Fidelity to conduct the great Business of America with Propriety. I must therefore beg of you Sir to offer my sincere thanks to the Assembly for the good Opinion they were pleased to entertain of me, and to desire them to appoint some one to succeed me for the ensueing Year, which I am informd commences early in November.

Mr Jay is to negotiate with Spain, Mr Carmichael to be his Secretary, & Colo John Laurens, Son of the late president Laurens, to be Secretary to Doctor Franklin. I shall not be able at this Time to give You a History of the proceedings of Congress, relative to their foreign Affairs; the Embarrassments, Difficulties & Delays attending this Business, in Consequence of the Disputes between the late Commissioners, have exceeded every thing of the Kind, which I have before met with: So far have some of their Friends in Congress been influenced by Attachments & prejudices, as to render it impossible to preserve their Friendship & Confidence, & at the same Time to act with becoming Freedom & Independence. I flatter myself that You will not hesitate a Moment, at accepting the highest office of Honor & Trust, under the United States, when elected thereto by the Voice of eleven States. Indeed it may be called unanimous, as there was only a single Vote for Doctor Franklin, who was not in Nomination, & it was said to have been put in by Delaware, at that Time represented by your old Friend Mr D____ n.(1) Great Exertions were made to send You to Spain, & Mr Jay on the other Embassy, but the Opposition of your Friends produced from the Gentlemen in Favour of Mr Jay, a proposal of Accomodation, in Consequence whereof he was appointed by eight States. The Appointment of Mr Dana is in my humble opinion of the next Importance, & should he accept it, he may stand Candidate for the next Vacancy in Europe. It is almost Time to acknowledge the Receipt of your esteemed Favours of the 27th of Novr 1778, & of the 10th & 11th Instant.(2) The first is of so early a Date as not to require an Answer, & a prudent Use shall be made of the last. Agreable to your Request in the other, I transmit by the Bearer Mr the Journals of Congress to the present Time, as far as they are printed, those for 1778 are now in the press. With Respect to the Circumstances of your first Appointment, It was in Consequence of a Nomination which I ventured to make, after having endeavoured to discover your Sentiments, on the Subject. I remember You was more reserved  SEPTEMBER 29, 1779  than I tho't You ought to have been, & two of your Collegues then in York Town, to whom I proposed the Matter, objected to it, as not being agreable to You. When the Nomination was made, if I rightly remember, the one that remained in Congress after You left it,(3) expressed his Doubts on the Occasion, but being determined to try the Experiment, I informed the House that I had communicated to You my design of Nomination, & that, altho You was very silent on the Affair, I was fully persuaded You would not decline the Duty. This fixed the Matter in the Minds of your Friends. Mr R. Livingston was nominated by New York, & by recurring to the printed Journals, You will find the Voters in your Favour distinguished by Dots, Vote 3d page 547. It is some Time Since this Transaction happened, & I may be mistaken in some points, but I further recollect, that in conferring with You, I mentioned my former Intention of nominating You in the Fall of the Year 1776, & that Mr R H Lee told me, You had informed him, that You would not accept the appointment if made, which last Circumstance, not being remembered by You, was an additional Argument in my Mind for pushing your Election at York Town. I conceived my self bound by every principle of Honour, Integrity, & policy, to \""vote You clear of Suspicion &c dishonorable to the States.\""(4) When the Question was proposed for inserting your Name in that Resolution, I opposed it as unjust, And the inclosed Copy of the futile Charge against You, & Evidence to support it, will I think warrant my Conduct. If unjust, then surely it was impolitick, as your future Usefulness would have been destroyed for a Time, at least I conceived it so, & was therefore bound in Honor not to sport with your Character. I mean not however to thro' a Reflection on the Conduct of Gentlemen of a different Opinion, they probably had a different View of the Subject, & may be highly commendable for a Measure, which it would have been criminal in me to have adopted. While I am on this Subject, give me Leave to observe, that your Letter to Congress, desiring a Copy of the Charges against You was yesterday read,(5) on which I moved the House to comply with your Request; but It was objected to from several Quarters as an improper Measure, since the House had almost unanimously, by your late Appointment rejected the Charge, & had in the first Instance cleared You of the Animosities subsisting amongst the other Commissioners. It was also said, that the Admission of Weight in the Charge, was dishonorable to the House, which in that Case would have been in Duty bound to postpone your Appointment, untill You were acquitted of the Charge. The Objections were agreable to my Mind & I withdrew the Motion, at the same Time informing the House, that I should furnish You with the papers requested. Upon the Whole, I am of Opinion, that in the Esteem of Congress, your Character is as high as any Gentleman's in America. That as much is obtained in the Arrangement & Determinations of our for-  eign Affairs as could be expected. That if Matters had been driven further, We should have been more deeply involved in Animosities & Dissention, & have put a total Stop to our foreign Negotiations. That in Consequence thereof, We must, on the Return of Monsr Gérard, have sunk in the Esteem of our Ally, of the Court of Spain, & of all Europe. That Doctor Franklin ought to be recalled. That however some late Measures may not be equal to our Wishes, It becomes our indispensible Duty to support them with Vigour, & to listen no more to Insinuations without Evidence to support them. That an able, upright, firm Friend to America, is greatly injured in Doctor Lee, as well by the Impolicy of some of his (6) friends, as by the undeserved Reproach of his Enemies. But that his Usefulness being destroyed, had it been practicable to have continued him in office, he could not have served with Satisfaction to himself, or Advantage to the publick. I have been well informed that Hints have been thrown out here, relative to my Votes for recalling Doctor Lee, which I do not relish; I have however suppressed my Feelings, because it is extremely injurious to the publick interests to have their Servants involved in disputes with each other. I shall return prepared to justify my Conduct in every point, & should any Attempts be made to misrepresent it, I shall be under the Necessity of shewing, that it has been ever directed in Congress by disinterested publick Motives; that it has been always free from Views, of extending my personal Interest or Influence, or of supporting private Attachments; & I think I can answer for the policy of the Measures which I have adopted. Perhaps You may think this deviating from Delicacy, but conscious of the Rectitude of my Intentions, I cannot bear the Breath of Reflection. I voted for the Recall of all the Commissioners included in the Resolution of the 20th of April last,(7) as an indispensible Obligation arising from the Resolution itself, and also, as a preliminary Measure for fully inquiring into the Conduct of those Gentlemen, that the Character of each may be fairly known, & represented to the publick. The States divided on Doctor Lee & he was continued in Office, contrary in my Opinion to every principle of Government, where a Majority is to rule. This happened by the Mode in which the Question was put, \""shall he be recalled\"", instead of \""shall he be continued\"". In the latter Case a Division would have lost the Question, & he would have been recalled, which the States who were against him being apprized of, conceived the Matter as it stood, both unreasonable & unfair. After Congress had finished their Instructions, relative to negotiations, A Question arose, who should execute them? Reference being then made to a Resolution of the 15th of April last, \""that Ministers plenipotentiary for these States, are only necessary for the present, at the Courts of Versailes & Madrid,\"" a Motion was made, \""That a Minister plenipotentiary in Lieu of a Commissioner be appointed to negotiate a Treaty of Alliance, & Amity & Commerce, between the united States of America & his Catholic Majesty,\"" & the   Question was carried as follows, six ayes, one no, & four divided. Massachusetts was amongst the latter, Mr Holten & myself, aye, Mr Lovell & Mr Partridge no. I tho't it necessary to agree to this Imposition, as it was consonant to the Resolution of the 15th of April; as it would give the States a fair Oppertunity of electing their Ministers; & thereby of correcting the Error mentioned-as a Decision of the question in the Negative would have postponed a Negotiation with Spain, and for some Reasons beforementioned, & others with which I shall not trouble You. To convince You of the Necessity of this last Measure, I need only inform You, that before the Resolution was proposed, Congress endeavoured to appoint a Minister to negotiate the peace, & failed in the Attempt, there being six States for Yourself, five for Mr Jay, & one divided. Those who were for Mr Jay, then declared, they would never alter their Votes, unless they had a fair Oppertunity of electing a Minister for Spain, & accomodating Matters to the Sense of a Majority of the States, which was prevented by the Failure of a Vote of the States when divided. One Word with respect to your Instructions, pray give me your Opinion on the Boundaries of Massachusetts Bay,(8) & if any thing is amiss, Mr Samuel Adams, if he thinks it expedient, may inform the State thereof, that they may give Directions for having it rectified in Congress. Cannot You attend to the Settlement of the Vermont Affair on the first of Feby next,(9) agreable to certain Resolutions sent to Massachusetts, which by her Delegates has claimed a Right to the Jurisdiction of those Lands. I should not have troubled You with such a Volume of small politics, did I not conceive it impracticable to weary the patience of a great politician. My best Respects to Portia, her Irony is by sovereign power turned into Fact. I wish that our Friend General Warren may peruse this Letter, & no other person at present, as it may otherwise be the Cause of my commencing Disputes, which I wish to avoid. Brother Dana may correct my Information relative to your first Election. Adieu my dear Friend with Assurance of Sincerity in your very humble Sert, E Gerry [P. S.] Is not Caution necessary in sending Letters or papers, which on certain Occasions ought not to be communicated? It sometimes happens that one Friend is nearly sacrificed to support another. I was on a Commitee which reported £3000 sterg per Year for each of the Ministers & £1000 ster per Annum for each of their Secretaries, the Salary to begin & end as prescribed by a former Resolution relative to the Commissioners; but I expect a Reduction of the first Sum will be made by some of our patriots, & am in Favour of £2500 sterling for the first & half that Sum for the Secretaries.(10) ""

I have so many things to say, and so little Time for the Purpose that I hardly know where to begin or conclude. The Inconveniences resulting from the Derangement of our Foreign affairs are at length removed. Doctr. Franklin with young Col Laurens are to remain in France, Mr J. Adams with Mr Dana for his Secretary is to negotiate a Peace with Britain, and Congress have been pleased to appoint me with Mr. Carmichael for my Secretary to negotiate Treaties of Alliance, Amity and Commerce with Spain. All this was done with most uncommon unanimity and Concord. The Importance of the Object and a Conviction that my Brother would under such Circumstances readily supply my Absence from the Family enduced me to accept the Appointment and I shall sail for France with Mr. Gérard. Mr. Huntington of Connecticut is now President of Congress, and I am persuaded will fill that Office with Propriety. The sooner you SEPTEMBER 29, 1779  provide for a Representation of your State here the better-God grant it may be an able one. The Resolutions respecting Vermont if prudently managed will establish perpetual Harmony between you and your Neighbours. I am confident of this. Temper & firmness will be indispensable. Let us not differ with them about Triffles, or by unnecessary Heats retard a Settlement satisfactory to all. It gives me Pleasure to assure you that the State stands high in the Esteem of the Confederacy, and a Continuation of the same means by which it was obtain'd will be necessary to perpetuate it. At this Season it is particularly expedient that your Delegates should be wise and prudent Men. You will then find it easy to settle your Disputes advantageously. I sincerely wish that the Chancellor and Mr. Hobart may be sent here,(1) as you know their Characters you will be at no Loss to perceive my Reasons for it. Mr. Duane will be a useful Man, but in my Opinion his Attention should be confined to general Objects, and ought by no means to interfere respecting the Vermont & New England Business, further that as a private, out of Door Counsellor. Morris will be serviceable (2)-His Abilities enable him to promote every Cause he may advocate, but if I may be permitted to advise he should restrain himself from taking any Part or pushing any Measure respecting your Disputes, without previous Concert with Livingston and Hobart. If this Plan be persued I have not the least Doubt of Success. I found it the most delicate affair to manage I ever was concerned in, and whoever it may be committed to, will soon concur with me in this Sentiment. It is of such great Importance to the State that no means however inconvenient, ought to be omitted to bring it to a happy Termination. Some members of Congress have just come in to do Business with me. Coll. Livingston will set off directly. I must, therefore, reluctantly conclude this Letter with assuring you that I am, your obt. & affect. Serv't, John Jay. ""

I shall write a long Letter to the Governor, on the Subject of the Delegation from New York and the Settlement of our New England and Vermont Disputes, which are now in a good Train, and if prudently managed must terminate to our Satisfaction. Of this I am certain. In my Opinion Duane, Hobart and yourselves ought to be sent. The first is well acquainted with the Minutia of the Controversy and his Information from time to time on the different Points that may be the Subjects of Investigation will be useful. Hobart is very agreable to the People of New England and this Circumstance independent of his other Qualifications, merits Attention. Your Manners, Abilities & Address will give New York great Advantage in contested Matters, and if Morris governs his Imagination will conciliate Friends. I wont bid you farewell in this Letter having much to say in the others which I shall certainly write.

But can I say so in Regard to Arthur Lee? However, I persude myself, his Honor is safe, and that he will spare a certain Body of Men as much as he possibly can and not be highly unjust to himself. You will hear much about acting in Concert with Count D'Estaing, and driving the Enemy from New York. But, I wish you would promote a Forwardness for aiding in a Blow to destroy Halifax. I tell you in Confidence that I more than suspect it to be his main Object, as the Supplies from thence are the only means of Byrons being in any Posture for operating.

7929,dg013623,1779,Samuel Holden Parsons,"""Samuel Holden Parsons   Sir [September 1779](1) The Board of Treasury in Answer to your Letter of the 6th Aug last to Congress & of the 30th of Augt to the Board have directed me to inform You that your Inferences from the 6th & 8th Articles of the Resolution of the 29th June last appear to them altogether groundless.(2) The Board are not acquainted with any Act of Congress that favours the Idea of redeeming the Bills of Credit or other Securities of the united States at a Discount. Congress have a Right to draw for Monies which they may have in Europe at the current Exchange, & persons may purchase or refuse such Draughts according to their opinion of the Terms on which they are offered, but this the Board conceives to be very different from your own & every other persons Idea of redeeming the Bills of Credit at a Discount. The 6th & 8th Articles of the Resolution of Congress of 29th June last mentioned in your Letter appear to the Board to have been necessary to induce Lenders to place their Money in the Funds; notwithstanding they knew that by the Resolution of Congress of the 2d Jany last, all Bills issued before the 1st Jany 1780 were funded & to be redeemed on or before the Year 1797; for as Congress had not in June last come to the Resolution which they have lately adopted not to emit more than 200,000,000 Dollars in Bills of Credit, & the Depreciation of Money continued without a prospect of it Stopping, the Lender who wanted this Interest of his Money for Subsistence SEPTEMBER 1779  must unavoidably suffer by the Depreciation which increased with the Quantity, unless the Interest was encreased in proportion & if at the End of the year or the Term for which the Money was hired, he was obliged to receive the principal & be thus deprived of the increased Interest he would receive very little Benefit from such an Increase, & then the Loans would be discouraged, to prevent which the Articles referred to were adopted. Again a person who had placed in the Funds a Sum of Money at a certain depreciated Value, & proposed to improve it in Commerce or in any other Way after taking it out of the Funds, must certainly be a looser should the Depreciation be increased at the Time of his receiving the payment of the principal, which further evinces the Necessity of the articles referred to. It is nevertheless evident, that to Lenders who propose to keep such of the Bills of Credit & other Securities of the united States as they do or may possess untill the Time of redemption, the Encouragement offered by the Resolutions of June last is not so essential, but the Number of such Lenders is few when compared to the others. Upon the whole, the Board are clearly of Opinion that the Bills of Credit which any person may hold at the Time of Redemption will be redeemed at the nominal Value, And that in paying off the Loans the strictest Justice will be done to the Lenders. The Board have determined to submit this Letter to the Consideration of Congress, that receiving their Sanction You may have the perfect assurance that it [is] agreable to their Sentiments. Ordered that a Copy of the Letter this Day agreed to be transmitted to Congress & if approved by them that it be signed by the Auditor General & transmitted to General Parsons. ""

I do myself the honor to enclose a packet of letters which being carried by your Servant to the place directed will greatly oblige me. We thank you for the trouble of attaching a Bond executed by the late Earl of Traquair. (1) This Letter will be Conveyed by Mon. Gérard, a most valuable and most amiable Man indeed! And who has given all the satisfaction possible in his public and private Character. No doubt you were astonished how any part of Congress should wish that all the Commissioners might be recalled to Philadelphia. It was for the purpose of explaining those unhappy dissentions and animosities which have arisen among them; and tho Yourself would have left Europe at a most critical period, yet returning to France with accumulated honors after receiving the blessings of America and convincing Congress in what path to walk upon this unhappy and most disgraceful business, perhaps the whole matter impartially considered the united States would have found great benefit if such a plan had taken place. The French are a gay people and entertain a good deal; I am afraid Mon. Gérard has thought the Delegates in SEPTEMBER 1779  Congress were rather deficient in that respect; but really the expence of every article is so very enormous, and the allowance from the different states so very trifling, that a person of a handsome American fortune could not entertain frequently without absolute ruin in the period of two or three years-and especially since some of the states think it best for their delegates to live in seperate houses. In the course of conversation you would do some of us a singular favor to hint this matter to Mon. Gérard-since it has the appearance of not paying proper Civilities to a man of his worth and elevated station. I have to honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient Sert. C. Griffin ""

7940,dg01410,1779,William Churchill Houston to Robert Morris,"""William Churchill Houston to Robert Morris   Dear Sir,(1) Philada. 2 Octr. 1779. Yours of 18 July last I received the 27 of the same Month, and am unhappy that I cannot, after waiting so long, speak with more Certainty relative to the Subject of it. That the present Plan of Confederation is not in all Parts just and equal, is, in my Opinion, a Proposition OCTOBER 2, 1779  as true as any in Euclid. I am confirmed in it by observing that the most candid People are of that way of Thinking, and those who are interested, particularly in the Mode in which what are called the Crown-lands, are disposed of, seem put to Difficulty in controuling their Consciences when they abet it. I often think that I would not submit to be roasted and basted as the Virginians and our Southern Friends are upon this Subject; for all the Lands will ever produce to their respective States. But like true Statesmen they do and bear any Thing on this Score. The Virginians endeavour to shelter themselves under an Argument which I never heard till I came to Congress, that they disputed the Right of the Crown to any Lands within the Bounds of their Charter, and contended for an Immunity from any Payments whatever claimed in Virtue of such Right; that Nothing but Force could have compelled such Payments from them; and that by joining with their Sister-states to renounce the Power and Jurisdiction of Great-Britain, they have only gained what other States have,-their Bounds. They add moreover, and persist in it, that the Settlement and Sale of these Lands will never be of any Value to their Treasury, or give them any available Assistance in discharging their Quota of the Continental Debt. This is in Part true & in Part problematical. Ingenious Men will speculate and refine up on any Subject, and the Truth or Falsehood of its goes out of Sight in the Multiplicity of Argument and Bluster of Utterance. Two Memorials lately came into Congress, one from the Proprietours of a Tract of Land on the Ohio called Indiana, granted by the Indians to a Company of Traders who had suffered Losses by their Means in the Course of Traffick; and the other from a number of Grantees of a large Tract including the former called Vandalia,(2) and which a little before the Commencement of the present Troubles it was in Contemplation to erect into a new Government. With both these Grants the Virginians have interfered, and the Memorialists complain of the Interference, and pray that they may not be deprived of their Property, and that Vandalia may be erected into, and acknowledged as a free State. This gave Alarm to the Virginians; they object to the Jurisdiction of Congress to receive or take Order on the Memorials, and in this Situation the Matter lies. How it will terminate, I am not able to conjecture. I think Congress are nearly equally divided upon the Question relative to the vacant Lands, and this being the Point to which Maryland most strenuously adheres, others are more out of Sight, but certainly it is not the only one in the Confederation where Justice does not seem to be strictly consulted. There are others little inferiour in my Judgment, though not so much discussed. The Virginians tell me they have made ample Provision to settle the Soldiers of any State, who will come and settle on their Lands without any Expense to the State from which they come;(3) and this would be of some Moment were it not for losing the Inhabitants, which for our Part we shall want at the End of the War. If any Thing relative to the   Confederation moves in Congress, I shall not fail to communicate it, and shall do it with the greater Pleasure, if agreeable to what I take to be your Wishes. I am sorry to hear you have not attended the Legislature this Sitting, though I know the State of your private Affairs affords a very sufficient Apology. You know our Situation at this Time. Many of our former Men of Business have forsaken us, new Statesmen must be employed, without Experience, sometimes without Knowledge, too late in Life to learn in Season, much Business to be done, difficult in it's Kind, a region unexplored, the Foundations of Government to be laid, the Superstructure to be raised, while every Thing is Hurry and Tumult around. I have a further View in saying this than to express my regret that you have not attended; I hope no private Consideration will have Weight to induce you to make Excuses against being a Member the ensuing year. Capable Men are wanted, and of no Profession more than that of the Law. It is certainly a discouraging reflection that the honest and faithful are sacrificing their Time and Opportunities to the Service of the Publick, while selfish Men are enriching themselves, and without one Thought of the Prosperity of their Country, are engrossed with Projects of private Gain: but Somebody must serve the State, and I hope at least it will be remembered who they are if no other reward is ever offered them. A Question of no small Importance has lately been decided in Congress by the recal of Mr. Arthur Lee. Much Time has been wasted here, and many Suspicions entertained through the Country, relative to this Matter. The Decision on his Merit, or Demerit must be left to Futurity, I own I am not at a Certainty about it, but I am happy the Matter is ended, as Things of more Consequence call for that Time which has been too much lavished on an idle Dispute. It is with Pleasure I can assure you that Subjects of Contention, and ill Humour are one after another taking their Leave, and that Unanimity returning which once made Congress respectable and useful, and will, I hope, make them so again. Does it ever lie in your Way to see Philadelphia, or are you ever at Princeton? It would give me particular Pleasure to spend an Hour, and I have Something of Concern, to me more especially, to communicate to you. Your Friendship would be of Use in it, and I flatter myself would not be refused. We have no Accounts as yet of any Operations of the Count D'Estaing in Georgia. Whether he will be able to effect his Purpose there will depend on many Circumstances, one of which is the Practicablity of doing a great Deal in a little Time. Should he think proper to push his Expedition as far Northward as to visit NewYork, it would be A Matter much to be lamented if we should not be in Preparation with Men and Provisions to cooperate. I hear the Legislature have passed a Law for facilitating a Supply to the Army,  and I sincerely wish the Execution may be so diligent as to put us in the best possible readiness. It would be a peculiar Misfortune if Count D'Estaing should be discouraged from coming through the Scarcity of Provisions or disappointed when actually come. How do you approve the Measure of stopping further Emissions of Paper-money? It is a risque, but in my View absolutely necessary; and I am persuaded if any kind of good Economy could be introduced into publick Departments, the War could be amply supported by Taxes, at least with the Assistance of a few Loans, and I would have as few as possible. I hope every Friend of his Country will now put on a double Spirit of Exertion. I know you will not be wanting. Here the People are bewitched. They seem to have no one Idea of Virtue and Patriotism left- Motives of private gain swallow up every laudable Principle. The Merchant against the Farmer, the Farmer against the Merchant. I wish New-Jersey were not so near them. You will please to excuse this lengthy Scrawl; if I had time to copy it over and shorten it, I would- It will give me Pleasure to hear from you, and I can venture to promise I shall not again be so long delinquent in advising of the Receipt of Favours.

I have lately written to you by divers opportunities to Charles Town directed in your absence to Colonal Gervais, from an opinion that you would have left that place & I had suggested to my friends the probability of your taking Passage in Count d'Estaing's squadron; this Idea is countenanced by intimations in your Letter of the 3d September which I received three days since. I therefore expect this will meet you at the Head Quarters of His Excellency the Commander in Chief. You were put in Nomination in Congress by the Honorable Mr. Gerry the 27th Ulto. For the Office of Secretary to the Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of Versailles & were on the 28th Unanimously elected by eleven, or twelve, States-the Salary not fixed- £1000 Stg recommended in a Report. I shall oppose every thing above £700.-but from what fund or funds is even that Sum to be paid?-I know not. The appointment is honorable to you in every appearance & will put you in a road leading to the service of your Country. I know you are equal to the task, nor could I forbear my testimony; it was due to a meritorious fellow Citizen, but I could not engage for your acceptance. Therefore you are by no means bound by any promise or even seeming promise on my part. I shall be glad to converse with you before you finally determine aye or no. You may, if you please, receive from me an honest & faithful & I believe accurate state of our affairs foreign & domestic. No attempts will be made on my part to induce or dissuade. You will be left by me to judge for your self. I need say no more but that I long to embrace you. I pray God to direct you in all Things & commend you to his protection, Henry Laurens. [P. S.] I might have added one word more. I wait here only to know your resolution, when I receive that from your self my Horses will be put to the vehicle in which I mean to return to my own poor distressed wretched Country. Capt. Roberts's conduct towards the Delegates of So. Carolina has not done the highest Credit to your recommendation-this as a hint. (1) 5th. October. This address remaining on my Table unsealed gives me an opportunity to add-the Salaries of the Ministers Plenipo. are £2500 Stg Per Annum each-of their respective Secretaries OCTOBER 2, 1779  £1000-in full of all expences &c. My protest against both stands on the Book No! Men who are sincerely devoted to the service of their Country will not accept of Salaries which will tend to distress it. ""

The Notice & Recollection of my former Letter sufficiently convinces me that You have not forgot an old Friend. In your Absence I had frequent Temptations to write You; but I was affraid of being amongst the Number of troublesome and useless Correspondants. We have finished Our foreign Affairs that mostly pressed upon Us. Your appointment will convince You, that however awkward Your Situation has been, it was not from any Alteration of Sentiment towards you since your first Appointment as one of Our Commrs. at Paris. I must hope, however hurksome the Task, You will once more be induced to quit the Rank of a Citizen to become a Servant of the Publick. We must all look back at Our first setting out, and take Spirit from those Principles which first annimated Our Souls; and which we lament that torpid, base Degeneracy, which hath seized too many, we must not suffer Ourselves to faint, or repine at Our Burthens. Mr. Dana is appointed Secretary, I rather wish for than expect his Acceptance, Yet I will hope that every Obstacle will give way to the good of his Country. If Mr. Dana goes he will be ready there should another Minister be wanted thro' Death, Sickness or otherwise. I shall rejoice to hear of your safe Arrival at Paris; And shall esteem myself truly happy in your Correspondance; for with great Esteem I am your, sincere Friend & Servt. Hy. Marchant ""

Since writing the enclosed (1) Mr. Fell has favoured me with the Sight of a Letter from you, in which you mention that if you consent to be proposed a Candidate at the ensuing Election, it will be for the Assembly rather than the Council. I have advised Mr. Fell to give his warmest Approbation of this Intention for two reasons. One, that there has not been a single Gentleman of the Law in the Assembly, which has been a great Defect, and Business has not been so well and so expeditiously done on that Account; and the other is that I have heard some Gentlemen preposterously [say] that they would not be Members of Assembly after having been Members of Council, because it would be a Degradation. Could wish this absurd Sentiment nipped in the Bud [for] if it should grow into an established Usage the  OCTOBER 4,1779  Inconveniencies to the Publick are obvious. One House certainly is as honourable and useful as the other. I have also advised Mr. Fell to suffer himself to be put up for Council, which I should not do if it were a Bar to his being elected to Congress. He can have his Election to continue in Council or be a Delegate, and all the Inconvenience will be putting the County to the Trouble of a new Choice which will not be much. The Sufferings and Sacrifices of Mr. Fell entitle him to every Respect from his County and from his Country, not to mention his Merit in other respects. Be sure to press Mr. Wilson to return to the Assembly. He is a worthy and capable Man, and fully justifies the Character you gave of him to me the first Time I saw [him]. I well recollect it. Yours with regard, William Ch. Houston ""

7949,dg01419,1779,Henry Laurens to John Adams,"""Henry Laurens to John Adams   My Dear Sir. Philadelphia 4th October 1779. The receipt & perusal of your favour of 10th Ulto. afforded me a very high satisfaction-the answer with which you honored my Letter of May 1778 (1) has not yet reached me. From the earliest intelligence of your return to America I felt a strong disposition to wait on you with a line or two of sincere congratulation on your happy return to your family & American friends, but there were certain irresistible pullbacks to the intended operation. I am not addicted to commonplace Ceremony & I perceived it extremely difficult to compose a palatable address, of blended gratulation & condolence to an exauctorated (2) fellow-Citizen who had deserved well of his Country & who at the same time stood in the most awkward situation that an honest susceptible mind can be reduced to-Sent, without his own desire & probably inconsistently with his Interest & inclination, on an ambassy beyond the Atlantic-kept unemployed-& in the course of a few Months virtually dismissed without censure or applause & without the least intimation when, or in what manner he was to return & report his proceedings. From these & other considerations I found myself constrained to wait future events. These, tho' a little clumsily brought forth, have happened as I wished, & now My Dear Sir, I not only congratulate you on a safe return but I have another opportunity of rejoicing with my Country Men on the judicious choice which Congress have made in their late election of a Minister Plenipotentiary to treat-in due time be it understood-with his Britanic Majesty on Peace & Commerce. The determination of Congress in this instance, will be grateful to the People of these OCTOBER 4, 1779  States & may expiate the queernesses of some of the queerest fellows that ever were invested with rays of sovereignty. Let me intreat you Sir, for my Country's sake, to accept the appointment without hesitation or retrospection, you know \""whereof we are made.\"" Wisdom & Patriotism forbid exceptions on account of past circumstances. I speak in pure truth & sincerity & will not risque offence by uttering a word respecting your fitness or peculiar or exclusive fitness for the important Office, but I will venture to add, it is necessary you should accept & stand ready to execute it, your determination to do so, will make the true friends of American Independence happy, & will abate their apprehensions from incompetency or negligence in other quarters-not that I believe you will be directly the object of negotiation, the Pride of our haughty Enemy will lead him to manoevre by mediation & my Ideas teach me to suppose, you are for some time to remain behind the Curtain but the moment cannot be far distant, according to present appearances, when you will step on the Stage & act a part, productive of substantial good to your Country, of honorable fame to yourself & to your posterity. My prayers & good wishes for your success will be accompanied by the utmost exertions of my feeble powers to insure it. I pay no regard to the slanders of stock jobbers, Monopolizers nor any of the various tribes & Classes of the Enemies of our Peace, it gives me some satisfaction however to know that better Men think well of me, but I draw an infinitely more solid consolation from this knowledge, that I have uniformly striven to persevere faithfully & disinterestedly in the service of my Country; this well founded assurance will in every event, however untoward, calm the mind & secure that Peace which neither the great nor the little World can give, or rob me of. I have, now, no hope of embracing you corporeally, on this or the other Continent to which you are going, but as a good Citizen & fellow labourer in the common Cause, my Heart will embrace you at whatever distance we may be from each other, be this as it shall happen, should we be permitted to come within reach, I tell you plainly & I know you will not be displeased, I shall prefer shaking hands in the old American stile. Should I be detained in Congress the ensuing Winter I mean to ask leave in the Spring to visit Massachusetts & New Hampshire as one of the last of my terrestrial peregrinations; that journey finished I hope the time will give me leave to withdraw & learn to die, a science I most devoutly wish to enter upon with a sedulousness which the present day prohibits. Commodore G's (3) ill success in France may possibly abate a little of his fervor for accomplishing every thing by the force of his own powers, his expences being fruitless will rnake no inconsiderable deduction from our Carolina finances & I am sorry to hear that when he returns to Charles Town he will be asked unpleasant questions respecting his general conduct & Don Juan de Miralles complains   heavily of one of his transactions at Havanna, these are things of no immediate concern to you, nor would it be instructive to say, 'tis difficult to judge of Men from appearances. I wish I had time to speak of the awful state of our national debt & Credit, the field is too wide for the Compass of a Letter, but believe me Sir, while we are decorating our fabric we are censurably careless of the foundation. Censure if ever it comes, will not light wholly on those whom the pious Duffield (4) calls \""the great Council of these States\"" each State at too late a day will find cause to apply blame to itself. We are at this moment on the brink of a precipice & what I have long dreaded & often intimated to my friends, seems to be breaking forth a convulsion among the People. Yesterday produced a bloody scene in the streets of this City, the particulars you will probably learn from other friends-and from circumstances which have come to my knowledge this Morning there are grounds for apprehending much more confusion. The Enemy has been industriously sapping our fort & we gazing & frolicing-peradventure we, meaning every State, may improve the present alarm to good purpose. But what shall we do by & by & not far distant, for quieting an hungry & naked Army. Shall we call forth a grand Convention in Aid of the great Council?(5) This may become absolutely necessary. I will presume on your kindness & friendship to trouble you by the next Post with a Packet for my friends in Europe & no further in the meantime but to subscribe with great truth, Dear sir, Your faithful, obliged & affectionate friend & servant, Henry Laurens ""

7951,dg01421,1779,to the Massachusetts Council,"""to the Massachusetts Council   Sir, Philadelphia Octr 4th. 1779 The Resolutions of Congress of the 24th of Sepr. last, & of the 2d Instant,(1) respecting the New Hamshire Grants, are so important in their Nature, that We think it our Duty to request You to communicate to the General Assembly, what occurs to Us on the Subject. It is generally known, that soon after the Declaration of Independence, Part of the People of the Grants, conceiving they had a Right to be a seperate State, refused to submit to the Jurisdiction of any of the united States, & in Consequence thereof, formed a Constitution & appointed a Government for themselves; & that this produced Controversy between them & the State of New Hamshire, & renewed their Disputes with the State of New York. Frequent Applications from the contending Parties have been made to Congress, & every Measure has been taken on their Part to heat the Divisions, untill the Causes thereof could be adjusted by the Articles of Confederation; but failing on this, & finding that the  OCTOBER 4, 1779  State of New York, & the people of the Grants were on the Eve of Hostilities, Congress have unanimously adopted the Resolutions referred to-should the States mentioned in the Resolves conform to the Recommendations thereof, We have every Reason to expect a speedy & equitable Settlement of their Disputes, as well with each other, as with the People of the Grants; Whilst the Claim of these to a seperate independent Jurisdiction, & the contested Titles of their Lands, will be fairly heard & determined. But, from our Knowledge of the Circumstances of the Controversy, We deprecate the Continuance of it as the inevitable Cause of an intestine War; & view this as an Event, the most desirable to our Enemies, discouraging to our Allies, & dangerous to our Liberties. The Assemblies of New Hamshire & N York having preferred to Congress, their Claims to the Jurisdiction of the Territory in Dispute, & the State of Massachusetts Bay having been silent on the Subject, We thot it our Duty to name it as a Claimant, to be included in the Resolutions mentioned;(2) & are clearly of Opinion, that their Claim will be weakened by a Neglect to appoint their Agents, & support it on this Occasion. The Delegates of New Hamshire, & N York, to prevent Delays, which may arise from the different Modes in which the States may comply with the Recommendations of Congress, have agreed to transmit to their respective States the Form of a Bill, a Copy of which at their Request, We inclose to the honorable Assembly,(3) remaining sir, with the highest Sentiments of Respect for them & yourself.

7952,dg01422,1779,Nathaniel Scudder to Henry Laurens,"""Nathaniel Scudder to Henry Laurens   Dear Sir, Monmouth (1) Octobr. 4th. 1779. I received your kind Letter of the 28th ultimo (2) with the Inclosures, for which I sincerely thank you. OCTOBER 4, 1779  Sunday 26th Septr. seems to me to have been with Congress a Day of strange Devotion. If none of the political or commercial Advantages of this Country shall prove to have been devoted by that Day's work, 1, for my own Part, shall be extremly happy. What must now become of the mighty Matters of Newyork versus Vermont? for the advantageous Management of which there was a special Delegation of one of their first officers,(3) who boldly declared, that unless certain Process immediatley took Place &c. &c. he would immediately quit his Seat & return to his State &c. &c. Can that gentleman under such special Trust, without the Leave of his State, the Business being unfinished, consent to accept a foreign Mission, and sail with Mr. Gerard? Let me answer yes undoubtedly, if he can aggrandize himself, & serve a P____ ty. I think I clearly perceive from the Paper you were pleased to furnish me with, that there was high Manouvring on that Day in the Prosecution of the Business, and I suppose the Success of the Resolution for appointing a Minister plenipotentiary to Spain must operate as a Supersedeas to Doctor Lee. I hope his Friends have taken Care to place the late Communications from the Honorable R. H. Lee Esqr. on such Ground as may prove advantageous to him, and secure the Honor of his Res--gn--n. I conclude Mr. D____ne (4) must be highly gratified with the Appointment of the Minister to Spain, and if Mr. C ___l (5) can be added as his Secretary, he may cry, all hollow, more especially if the said Minister should be pitched upon to examine and attest his Accounts in France, which I suspect will be attempted. Can't Mr. Adams with great Propriety be sent on soon, and, in the Interval, which must even before he can enter upon the Business of his Mission, attend to that important Business of Accounts in France? I wish he might. Do you imagine the Instructions for a commercial Treaty with B____n (6) as they now stand will be sent on? I earnestly hope not. I can never consent, that those infernal Butchers of our Brethren shall be immediately (their hands driping with our Blood) be put, in point of Commone, upon the same advantageious Footing with our noble and generous Ally & their Connections. I shew your Communication to Doctr Witherspoon, which I judged no Infringement of the restrictive hint in your Letter. I intended when I left Town to have returned by to morrow's Stage, but the ill State of Mrs. Scudder's Health, and the Circumstances of my Family forbid; nor can I determine precisely when I shall be down. We expect the Appearance of the Count at Sandy Hook every hour-as soon as I hear of his Arrival I shall endeavour to pay him another Visit, and perhaps if Heaven succeed him, may have the Pleasure of being in New-York before I return. Pilots are providing for him as fast as possible-two of them lodged with me last Night, and are gone down this Morning. I heard last Evening the Enemy had evacuated Rhode Island, and ordered all the Troops to New York, if so, they mean to make a  OCTOBER 5, 1779  desperate Push for the Salvation of that Post-this I the rather think to be their Intention, as they have now a large Number of Men on Sandy-Hook erecting a Fort and Batteries with very heavy Cannon, to prevent if possible the French Fleet from entering the Bay. In this I think however they cannot succeed, as with the Tide and a brisk S. Wester Ships may run by and sustain little Damage. I earnestly wish to hear what has been their Success to the Southward. I will presume it has been compleat. A Line from you, as often as convenient, will be extremely gratifying. I'll chearfully repay them with Such Scrawls as the current, which I beg youll excuse, as on Account of an urgent Call from the sick, I am not able to copy it. If it is possible to comply with your Request in purchasing the Articles you mention, I will do it, tho' I wish you had hinted nearly how far I might go in Point of Price, as every Thing is amazingly risen of late. Please to present my most respectfull Complements to all our Friends in Congress, and permit me, Dear Sir, to assure you that I am with the most sincere Esteem and Affection, Your most obedient & very humble Servant.

The good opin[ion] which you and other Gentlemen of the County, entertain of my conduct to induce you to Put me in nomination as a Candidate for the Council is a matter which requires my most gratefull thanks, but if I had ever so great an inclination to accept your kind offer, I dare not live at home, therefore if I must continue to be deprived of all Domestick Happyness, the being here on Account of safety, is the most Eligeable. I shall think myself happy to be left out in the next choice of Members for Congress, lett my Collegues be whom they may.

I am exceeding glad of your good intention of going in to the Assembly, give me leave to say without flattery You will be a valuable acquisition in that House, but I do not see how the confinement is less. Now we have chiefly and to my great satisfaction got through Our foreign affairs; and I hope the Name of Lee will be no more mentiond, that we shall do business [in a] better humour. On Saturday we began with a Committee of the whole house to consider on Finance and ways and means to carry on the War, and in a few days I hope the Public will be made acquainted with what we expect from them so that we shall at least do Our Duty.

A number of Gentlemen got in the House with him to defend him, when those in the Street began to grow very Restive and at last fired in the House when the Batle became general. Some I beleave were Killd on Both sides and many wounded. When fortunatly the President (Reed) came up at the head of the Light Horse and his Spirited behavour Put an end to the affair and a number of them, were sent to Prison.

7956,dg01426,1779,William Churchill Houston to Caleb Camp,"""William Churchill Houston to Caleb Camp   Sir,(1) Philada. 5 October 1779. I am sorry that it has not been in my Power to command as much Time as I should have wished to employ, in giving a distinct Account to the Legislature of the most material Occurrences in the Progress of Business since I came to Congress. It is certainly the Duty of every Person in publick Trust to make those from whom he derives his Appointment acquainted with the Manner in which he executes it, that they may be enabled to decide how far he fulfils or deceives their Expectations, and to form, at any Time, a clear Estimate of his Character. Next to Want of Fidelity, I look upon the Neglect of giving due Information to his Constituents, the greatest Crime in a publick Man. The principal Intention of this is to point at a Question which from accidental Circumstances has acquired a Magnitude and Importance above what, simply considered, it was entitled to. A Question which has excited much Inveteracy and Ill-blood in Congress, and not a few Speculations and Suspicions abroad. I mean the Recal, or rather Supersession, of Mr. Arthur Lee, Commissioner of the United States at the Court of Madrid. I have carefully read over the Papers, and attended to every feasible Means of unbiassed Information rela- OCTOBER 5. 1779  tive to this Question, and I think have done it with a Temper divested of Prejudice. The Result is this: I take Mr. Arthur Lee to be a man of a jealous, suspecting, difficult Disposition; trusty, capable and industrious. Indefatigable above others in procuring and transmitting Intelligence, accurate and frugal in Expenses and Mony-matters, simple, severe and republican in his manners; so much so as to be thought by many sour and cynical. This I take to be his Character; and in many Essentials I am not afraid to call him equal to any Person Congress ever employed in a similar Capacity in Europe. The Story hawked about, that his Indiscretions prevented the Court of Spain from treating with him, I cannot think believed by those who propagate it, as that Conduct in the Spanish Ministry is ascribable to very different Reasons which must strike every Person at once who has the least Knowledge of the State of matters as they respected that Power. But admitting he were the best-qualified and most meritorious Man on Earth, is it not my Duty to vote for removing him when the Time of Congress is absolutely wasted, and the publick Business not only retarded but stopped by unavailing Altercations concerning an Individual? When a General offers up a forlorn Hope to save an Army, the Alternative is dreadful; but the Principle is defensible and the Practice of it often necessary. I confess that in a republick, where Approbation, Honour and Praise, more than Money and Emoluments, are the Reward of faithful Services, such Things ought to be admitted with Reluctance and Caution; yet still they may not be always avoidable. But further, should it turn out to be a Fact that France was doubtful of him, and that Spain hesitated, it mattered not how good a Man he was, one every way inferiour, if free from such Exception, would have been preferable for the Purpose of treating. The real Causes of Delay being now removed, it is to be hoped the gentleman who succeeds Mr. Lee will be successful. As I would ever wish to be simply just, but at the same Time to do what is best, all Things considered, I have no other Request than that this State of Facts may be remembered another Day, when Time will throw Light upon what is now dark, Prejudice will be extinct and the Means of judging fairly will come within the Reach of all. Into what Course of Conduct, or to what Length of Crimination, Resentment may impel this unfortunate Man, I am excused from surmising. Whether, as many have done, he will adhere to the Part he has taken in Spite of what he may think ill Treatment; or whether, as many have also done, he will transfer himself to a Situation where he will expect more Attention; does not belong immediately to the present Decision; at least, I have taken the Liberty to throw it out of the Balance. At all Events I am happy this troublesome Affair is ended, and I hope it will never rise up to disturb the Counsels of America more. Subjects of Contention and Animosity are retiring one after another, and Unanimity reviving in Congress where it is so essentially necessary. Trifles have had their Day, and too long a one has it  OCTOBER 5, 1779  been; Matters of Moment have now a Claim to their, and that it may not only be longer, but perpetual, I am persuaded is the ardent wish of every honest Man. Upon reviewing what I have written, a Suspicion occurs that the above Representation may imply a Reflection on the Conduct of some of my Colleagus, which is as far from my Meaning as it would be repugnant to Justice. The Time is not the same, other Circumstances also disagree. On the contrary I must declare that I think their Situaton hard and undeserved. The whole Train of the Transaction I can trace minutely. To the Quarter from whence the Accusations have originated, the Motives which inspired them and the Instruments which have been employed for their Circulation I am not a Stranger, nor am I surprised at any Thing thus far. But that their Fellow-citizens should entertain Impressions unfavourable to those they once thought well of, and not call for an Investigation of their Conduct, or suspend their Opinions till an Explanation should be had, may perhaps be a Matter of some Discouragement. If the Gentlemen know what is alledged to their Charge, I am astonished they do not apply for an Opportunity of Justification. Certainly if I should ever be of Importance enough to be found fault with, I should expect the Liberty of explaining Facts and Motives; after that it is the Part of an honest Man to submit in Silence to the Judgment of those who have a Right to pass upon his Conduct. I enclose sundry Papers marked from Number 1 to 5 (2) which I have met with since I came to this Place, and which I have copied for the Sight of such Gentlemen of the Legislature as may think it worth their Trouble to read them. They relate to a Matter which was before the Legislature at their last Sitting previous to the present. One, if not more of them, is on the Files of the Assembly. They may be of Use on some future Occasion, but my principal Object in copying them is to communicate the noble and dignified Sentiments of the Commander in Chief, and to give some Idea of the Difficulties he has to encounter. If ever any Man deserved Gratitude and Confidence he does, and the more especially as his modesty will never allow him to be elated with the former, nor his goodness of Heart to abuse the latter. His Letter marked No. 2 is an Example of it's Kind. It is necessary that I give you the Trouble of communicating to the Houses the Substance of this lengthened Letter.

You are mistaken as to how much a man can do for himself. The newspapers of to day will show you what a body of men can do against themselves.(1) Arthur Lee is recalled by an authenticated newspaper which will reach him accidentally, before any official information can go in the usual and decent course. So that if Jay is taken, or drowned, we shall have a total suspension of negotiations for a time. Will you not think it strange after what I see, that I should have an idea of being willing to go with Mr. J. A. in case D refuses?(2) As it is precarious in regard to D 's Situation, I wish I had been chosen in the first place. I know your idea is for France, but I should have the most implacable enemies there who think they have a right of occupancy in the Secretaryship. Besides the latter is residentiary, the former temporary.(3) Our Gazette says nothing of the killed and wounded yesterday before Wilson's door and in his house. I am told Capt Campbell of the Invalids, a one handed officer, was killed and General Mifflin's brother wounded in the house-that (4) were killed and several wounded in the street. A party of armed men had some Tory characters on parade through the Streets. Wilson is said to have expected a visit and to have forearmed himself and a collected number. Whether an attack was made from without, or whether provocations indiscretely were made from within, I cannot tell; two stories as usual, are circulated. If you are in Boston you will know all I have written to Mr J & S Adams, Mr Dana or Dr Cooper; if you are not there Peabody will give you at Portsmouth all the manoeuvres of Chesnut St. I have not yet seen the Tall Boy;4 the Tall Man (5) good uncle Roger arrived the day after the Sacrifice.

And now let me conceive you at Portsmouth with all your affectations of indifference to what has been the object of the wishes of the bravest Generals in History to say nothing of the wise King Solomon and the good King David.

7972,dg01442,1779,John Jay to George Clinton,"""John Jay to George Clinton   Dear Sir, Phil'a, 7th Oct'r 1779. You will receive this by Mr Phelps, of whose Fidelity to New York I have a good opinion; tho I cannot approve of all his Manoeuvres to serve the State on this occasion. (1) He appears neither to Want Talents or Zeal, but the latter is not always according to knowledge, and the former carry him sometimes into [. . .]. One of the New Hampshire Delegates told me that Phelps, in order to engage him against Vermont, endeavoured to persuade him that New Hampshire had a Right to a number of Townships in it; and he further told me, that on comparing Notes with the Massachusets Delegates, he found that Phelps had been playing the same Game with them. This Story he told me in the Presence of some of the Massachusets Delegates who smiled and were silent. I have never said any thing of this to Phelps because it could have answered no good Purpose; And I mention it to you, as a Circumstance which marks the Man. He has however by talking on the Subject with every body, done good. In my opinion his Expences should be paid without Hesitation, and he should be so treated as to go home in perfect good Humour with the Legislature, for whom he now professes great Regard & Esteem, & I believe he is  OCTOBER 7, 1779  sincere in his attachment. Men of his Turn and Talk are always useful when properly directed. It is easily done by encouraging the good opinion he entertains of his own Importance. The exceeding high opinion entertained here of your Constitution and the wisdom of your Counsels, has made a deep Impression on many People of wealth and Consequence in this State, who are dissatisfied with their own; and unless their opinions should previously be changed, will remove to New York the moment the Enemy leave it. Mr. Gerard, (who seems better acquainted with Republics than almost any man I have ever known) has passed many Encomiums on our Constitution & Government and I am persuaded, no Circumstance will conduce more to the Population of our Country by Migrations from others, than the Preservation of its Vigor and Reputation. This unhappy City is all in Confusion-the Government wants Nerves, and the public Peace has for some Days been destroyed by Mobs and Riots which seem to defy the authority of the Magistrate. This is one of the Fruits of their whimsical Constitution, and of the Countenance given to Committees & Let Politicians learn from this, to dread the least Deviation from the Line of Constitutional Authority. Obsta Principiis, is a good Maxim, but all have not sufficient Decision in their Conduct to observe it. Government once relaxed is not easily braced. And it is far more difficult to reassume Powers than permit them to be taken and executed by those who have no Right by the Constitution to hold them. Morris is again with us, and I am glad of it. His Constituents must be either infatuated or wretchedly misinformed, if they omit continuing him in the Delegation.(2) But you know my Sentiments on this Subject, and it is unnecessary to dwell on it. For Heaven's Sake, send an able Delegation and preserve the high Rank you hold among the States. I wish Hobart (3) may be sent- at this Season he would be particularly useful, and I am sure until your Vermont Business be over, a special occasion for his being here will clearly exist. One of the New Hampshire Delegates (4) seems much inclined to make the Ridge of mountains instead of Connecticut River, the Boundary between us; and that the Soil between the Mountains and the River should remain the Property of those to whom it had been granted either under New York or New Hampshire. He observed and I think with Propriety, that this Line by dividing the disaffected between the two States, would render the Reduction of them to good order less difficult, and by interesting both States in their Allegiance prevent their again acting in a Body or easily uniting their Counsell for Purposes injurious to Government. My Reply to this Gentleman was, that I had no Authority to say any thing on this Subject, that I knew the State of New York to be sincerely disposed to cultivate Harmony with her Neighbours, and was persuaded that no Settlement founded in Justice & mutual Convenience will be disagreable  to them. To you however I must confess that the Line he proposed does not appear to me to be impolitic. We have unquestionably more Territory than we can govern, and the Loss of that Strip would not in my opinion overballance the Advantages resulting from it. On the contrary, unless I am much mistaken, exclusive of other Considerations, the less our People have to with Connecticut River the better. I would rather see the Productions of our Country go to the Sea by another Rout. The Country west of Niagara, on the present Ideas which prevail and by the articles of Confederation, belongs to New York. As it lies beyond the convenient Reach of Government, the Retention of it would rather incommode than benefit us. It would always be the object of Envy and Jealousy to the other States, and perhaps the Subject of Dispute. I would therefore be for ceding it to the Continent at a proper Season, or otherwise disposing of it in a way that would conduce to the Credit and Interest of the State. To this Way you can be no Stranger.(5) There is another Matter which I think deserves Attention-it is the Seat of Government. On this Subject I have bestowed much thought. The Result is a perfect and full Conviction that Snectady is the only proper place in the State, and the sooner the Idea is adopted and carried into Execution the better. Should I have Time and Opportunity before my Departure I shall transmit to you my Reflections on this Subject. Many of them will naturally occur to you. I will just hint however, that it will not be easy to remove the Seat of Governmt. from any Place you may appoint for the Purpose & therefore that great Care should be taken in the Choice. My Sollicitude for the Welfare and Honor of the State prompts me to say many other things interesting to both, but I have no Leisure at present. I must however recommend to you to appoint Coll. Hughes to be Sherif of the City & County of New York. I should also think it right for the Council of Appointment to provide for Cols. Lamb & Malcolm. Believe me to be, dear Sir, your affectionate Friend & Serv't, John Jay. ""

7973,dg01443,1779,Henry Laurens to George Washington,"""Henry Laurens to George Washington   Dear sir. Philadelphia 7th October 1779. The day before yesterday I was made very happy by the receipt of Your Excellency's Letter of the 29th Ulto. (1) I had been for some time wishing for a good occasion to pay my respects, nor had subjects been wanting, but such as appeared to me worthy of Your Excellency's attention were of so serious a cast, as to awe me into silence in more than one attempt, nor dare I even upon the present opening expatiate or be explicit. When I had the honor of seeing you in Town I expressed my apprehensions of calamitous events in a short contrast of gain & loss. Your Excellency will also remember my sentiments on the question of appreciation of our Paper Money & the foundation on which I built the opinion which I had then the honor of delivering. I had not been long returned to this City when I discovered there was no solidity in the intelligence alluded to; & our internal circumstances from that time have been descending from bad to worse, referring to the latter I hope we are now at our ne plus ultra. At length you have seen Sir, a Resolution to \""stop the Press,\"" as it is termed, an act which I ardently wished for in Augt 1777, on condition of necessary previos steps of taxation, had we then determined this important point our Public debts foreign & domestic would have been at this day comparatively trifling but when the proposition even at a much later day & when we were overwhelmed with Paper, was, to make that an Harbinger which ought to have been consecutive & secondary, I found my self necessitated to dissent from it. We have pledged our honor that we will emit no more promisary Notes & are reduced to a dependence on contingent circumstances for supplies for carrying on the War & for supporting Public Credit. We are now but beginning to call on the several States for their quota of 15 Million Dollars per Month from the 1st February to the 1st October next inclusive. I doubt the practicability, the possibility of a compliance & my suspicions are strengthned by this observation, that those who were most anxious, most outrageously or blindly pressing for the premature determination, are most reluctant to bearing an equitable proportion of the burthen-'tis impossi- OCTOBER 7, 1779  ble says one-'tis impracticable says another, for my State to raise such a Sum in one Month. Should we fail in this project & find an empty Treasury in the Month of March or earlier, which I most feelingly dread, what will be the consequence? To reply in the mildest terms, much confusion & derangement of public affairs, peradventure, commotions & convulsions in the Army, in the Country, & in the Cities-to repeat Emissions would be infamos & inefficacios-all Credit would be lost. For averting these impending evils vigoros Resolutions are absolutely necessary in the several States to comply fully & punctually with the requisitions of Congress & those must be supported by virtuos & patriotic exertions of Individuals, nor ought we to lose a moment or to wait till January for beginning the work. I shall say every thing I can think of to induce my Country distressed as it is, to contribute her part for the salvation of our Independence, but alas we have no fix'd principles for our guide, the requistition is barely 15 Million per Month; our expenditure the lately voted subsistence to the Army included amounts fully to that Sum & the daily increasing prices of Provisions deprives us of all ground for prospective calculation. Your Excellency is too well acquainted with the difficulties of procuring proper supplies of food for the Army, but are you apprized Sir, of the probability of our deficiency in Cloathing? You may have been told that ample quantities are expected from France, if you place any reliance on such information, 'tis high time you should be undeceived & I esteem it a duty to my Country & an act of friendship to Your Excellency to assure you that our applications to our Ally for Clothing & Military Stores, which humanity, foresight & vigilance would have sent forward in March last or earlier, were not embarked until the latter end of July or beginning of August. From this improvident delay we cannot, even hope to, receive those articles before January or February next, the application must undergo the necessary formalities at Court, admitting success there, Orders are to be issued, Clothing to be provided made,(2) Ships prepared, the Atlantic to be crossed & a Port to be entered at 3 or 4 hundred Miles distance from the Army in the very worst season for transportation. Can the several States supply the necessary wants & in proper time for saving our brave fellow Citizens from another Valley-forge scene? Or, are we again & again to rely on the Chapter of accidents or the interposition of Heaven in favor of Men who will not make a proper use of means. These things unknown to some & unheeded by others who ought to be attentive & indeed answerable, were they declared abroad would alarm many an honest & zealos heart now wraped in profound security. If in this confidential communication I have offered anything new, Your Excellency who in every view, is peculiarly Interested in the happy existence of the Army & the event of the War, will make some advantages from the disclosure & in any   case I am perfectly satisfied there will be no unfavorable construction passed upon my motives-what I have said in private can have no tendency to sounding unnecessary alarms & yet in truth it appears to me almost time to rouse & call forth that virtuos spirit which led us into the present War & which is now benumned & motionless- upon our own virtue our final success depends. I am sure there still exists virtue enough scattered among us to Insure that success. I lament the prospect of a convulsion as necessary for collecting & bringing it into action. We have chosen Ministers Plenipotentiary for treating with the Courts of Madrid & London, the former was a necessary appointment, the latter if the Act be not unseasonable, the publicity of it I am afraid will be attended with pernicious effects, can we expect the pride of Great Britain will condescend to treat abruptly & directly with a revolted subject & immediately too after having refused the mediation of a Crown head. I entertain certain distrusts on the point which I wish could be communicated without the use of Pen. The thing however is done & become notorious before this day in the Garrison at New York from whence I expect to see in a few days droll strictures & severe animadversions by some of Mr. Rivington's correspondents . I must now turn to Your Excellency's Letter from which I have wandered perhaps too far. The Proclamation by His Britanic Majesty which has been lately published,(3) implies an apprehension of a serious attack on his Kingdom, but neither my depth in Poltics nor in the secrets of the European Courts reach far enough to determine on the utility of one step beyond keeping that Kingdom alarmed & acting vigorosly against its Marine-but it seems to me a joke to say the English Fleet was blocked up in Torbay, which if I am not mistaken is as accessible as any part of the British Channel & as undefended except by the Fleet which may chance to ride there, a little time will enlighten us on these & other important subjects. I am seldom detected in anticipating events but I must confess that I feel an unusual anxiety to see our late King's Speech to his Parliament at their Meeting which I suppose will be early in the present Month. I wish he may have an opportunity of undeclaring that Georgia is at his Peace. General Prevost's ill success in South Carolina will however supply him with an unpalatable spice for the composition & I trust Count d'Estaing has added a still more bitter ingredient for a subsequent Message. Your Excellency's Letter to General Lincoln (4) will go forward by an Express to morrow, 'tis now the 9th. I have been three Mornings on this performance in scraps.(5) I live at a considerable distance from the State House, have many Committees to attend & waste much of my time by a useless habit of punctuality. Colonel Laurens having intimated to me under the 3d September a design to return into Your Excellency's service by Sea in Count  d'Estaing's Fleet, I have directed to him at Head Quarters, my Letter will be inclosed with this,(6) & I am persuaded he will tell Your Excellency what I have said on his late appointment. I have not presumed to say, don't go-but I beg the liberty upon second thoughts of leaving the Letter under a flying Seal until Your Excellency shall have perused it if you will be pleased to take that trouble. From the prospect abovementioned I shall also return Your Excellency's Letter for him under the present cover.(7) I beg pardon Sir, for this long intrusion & subscribe with great truth, Your Excellency's Much obliged & most Obedient servant, Henry Laurens ""

Congress yesterday determined to raise 15 Mills. per Month from the 1st Feby to the 1st Octr. inclusive. They did me the Honor to appoint me on the Committee for apportioning this sum.(1) I was unadvised from the State on this Subject but from what I learnt at Kingston deemed it my Duty to endeavor at lowering our Proportion which was effected as well in the Committee as in the House without dissatisfaction tho' not without Difficulty. Perhaps I may not have thoroughly accorded with the Views of my Constituents if so let me bear the Blame singly and none of it fall on my worthy Colleagues as I am the blameable.

But I rely on their Wisdom, on their Experience, on the Reason and Nature of things which must at length draw all things into those proper Channels from which temporary Expedients may vainly have forced them. The Attempts which may be made to recover our Capital I wish may prove Successful for so many Reasons that it would be needless to mention (further than to observe that all lesser ones are swallowed up in it) the Consideration that the Legislature as they are in Capacity will exert themselves to replenish the treasury of the Continent with Sums as much greater than those now called for as the Prosperity of the State will be superior to what it now can boast of.

We have not had yet any intelligence from the Southward except flying reports such as I find you have heard. On Monday last we have a great riot in this city. A body of two hundred militia assembled for the purpose of expelling all such as they considered Tories: among these they considered Mr. Morris, Mr. Wilson, Gen. Higbee (?) and included all such who had distinguished themselves in opposition to the present Constitution and Code of Pennsylvania. Apprized of the design of the militia those gentlemen collected their friends and armed themselves and took post in Mr. Wilson's House. The militia assembled in the Commons and dismissed their officer (?) not being obedient enough to their orders: they now marched into the City to Mr. Wilson's House where a formal engagement took place. The militia firing in platoons at Wilson's windows & the other Party firing from the windows: four of the militia I hear were killed & ten wounded: one of the other party was killed & four wounded. Happily for both parties Governor Reed headed the light horse of the City and in a lucky moment just as Wilson's doors were broken down charged with drawn swords on the armed militia, wounded several, took many prisoners & put the rest to flight. The next day the militia again assembled but without arms & obliged the Justices to commit to jail several of Wilson's party. Gov. Reed being absent with the lighthorse at Germantown OCTOBER 8, 1779  this day. On the Governors return they were released. This day the Governor and Counsel met at the State House to investigate the affair & both parties are to be heard. Lee is despleased [displaced?]. Mr. Jay is appointed Minister to Spain.

I am happy to OCTOBER 9, 1779  find by yours of the 16 Septr. you are in your own House & Sincerely wish you every Domestic happiness you can possibly desire. Had Coll Rochester Called upon me according to his promise, you would certainly have heard from me by him. Long before I received yours I had Congratulated Miss Vining on the Brilliant & Successful attempt of Major Lee on Powles' Hook. Her Mamma & herself present their affectionate compts to you, the young Lady promises to write by this Express, I fear she will be worse than her word. Spains declaration against Britain may as you Conjecture, prolong the war. Mr. Jay is Appointed Minister Plenepotentiary to the Court of Madrid, & Mr. Carmichael his Secretary, John Adams is Appointed Minister Plenipotentiary to Negociate a Peace, Mr. Dana his Secy. and Coll Laurence son of Old Mr. Laurence, Secretary to Docr. Franklin. Fifteen millions per month is Called for from the Sevl. States. Quere will it be paid? I believe not, the Consequences you must know will be distressing indeed. The Quota of Our State is Out of Proportion but this could not be avoided. We hourly expect good News from Georgia, surely the force the Count has with him, must soon settle Matters in that Quarter, should no unforeseen Accident intervene. He is soon expected here, which will render this a very Active, & I hope Successful Campaign. The No. Carolina Troops were Ordered to the Southward, but this Order has been Countermanded by Genl. Washington,(1) on his hearing of the Arrival of Count DeEstang, many are so Sanguine in their Expectations, as to believe we shall be in Possession of N York & R Island this fall. God send it may so happen. Sullivan has been very Successful in the Indian Country, having destroyd all their Settlements; it is hoped this may prevent the depredations of those Savages for some time. The Press stops at 200 Millions which I believe will be expended in December. Out of the 60 Millions which was heretofore called for from the States, only 3 Million have been recieved. How the war can be carried on after that period (Decr.) I know not, I do not expect the Treasury can possibly be supplied by the States 15 millions per month; North Carolina I am confident cannot supply her Quota Monthly. I dread the Consequences, but as you say \""we must take events as they happen.\"" For Gods sake come on to relieve me in Novr., but at farthest the very beginning of December & make that Domestic creature Whitmil Hill come with you. In fact I can not live here, the prices of every necessary has advanced at 100 per cent since we parted. I shall return indebted to my Country at least 6000 dollars, and you very well know how we lived. Do not mention this Complaint to any person. I am Content to sit down with this loss, & much more if my Country requires it. I only mention it to you to guard you against difficulties which you must encounter on your return, unless the Gnl Assembly make suitable provision for yr. expences at least. I know they   will be Liberal, they always have been in their Allowances to their Servants. Could not Hooper, Nash, Johnston, or some such be sent with you, believe me they will be much wanted. I acknowledge it is cruil in me to wish you to return; you have already suffered more in your private Concerns, than any man who has been in the Delegation for Some time past. But you have this Consolation; that should you fail of receiving your reward in this World, you will no doubt be singing Hallilujas in the Next, to all Eternity-Tho' I acknowlege your Voice is not very well Calculated for that business.

This evinces the necessity of the punctual payment of their respective Quotas on which their public credit, the existence of their Army, and the support of their Liberties so greatly depend. Congress are deeply concerned to find that the sums required are so great but since the emissions are limited, they doubt not that the operation of taxes and other salutary measures in the course of the year will reduce the prices of articles and enable them to lessen the quotas required or apply part thereof to diminish the public debt. To promote so desirable an object Congress on their part will endeavour to observe the strictest OEconomy in their expenditures.

On the 4th Inst. & no earlier I received your favor of the 20th July together with Doctor Oliphant's return of the state of the Hospital in the southern department. These papers had been detained by Doctor Read who being retarded by sickness was a long time performing his journey from CharlesTown. I shall be particularly attentive to your recommendations, & Doctor Oliphant may rely on my endeavors to obtain an establishment of the Medical department in So. Carolina & Georgia under his direction. (1) The Chairman of the Medical Committee is not yet return'd, consequently no report, on the Commitment spoken of in my last, has been made.(2) I judge it best to hold in my own hands Doctor Oliphant's return 'till that Gentleman shall appear, the presentation will then, act upon him as a stimulous. Public business is exceedingly delayed in Congress by this fluctuatality of its Members, but I will not leave Philadelphia before I see the articles in question determined. Every Thing practicable is going forward in this quarter for enabling the Commander in Chief to co-operate vigorously & efficaciously with Count d'Estaing. The Frigates & the North Carolina Troops which had been ordered to Charles Town are arrested & Gen. Sullivan with his healthy Troops, who have made great slaughter of Indian Towns & Indian Corn is called to join the Main Army. But a question begins to be now seriously put by every body, what has Count d'Estaing done in Georgia & where is he? We cannot learn either by Land or Sea intelligence of him. You will receive under cover with this Dunlap's Packet containing Copy of a Letter from Major General Sullivan giving an account of his late Military peregrination.(3) I think it was a little mischievos to print the whole, be that as it may, he has certainly made severe retaliation upon the barbarians who will be driven to the utmost distress the approaching Winter by a deficiency of provisions & by OCTOBER 9, 1779  the loss of their \""large & elegant Mansions.\"" The General has unluckily displeased by complaints which are said to be groundless, the Commander in Chief, & given high umbrage to the Board of War & to the quarter Master general, but this if you please, inter nos. Anxious to see the Stores which you had sent for go forward I applied three days ago to the War office, where I was informed by Mr. Peters that the whole were in readiness for departure or very nearly so-but, that it would be impossible to give further aide until large supplies shall be received from France. This cannot possibly be effected earlier than January or February next, in the mean time, I trust a proper use will be made of the authority vested in our State to import.

Having lately explained to You some Matters, relative to our internal political Manoeuvres, It is needless to trouble You farther on that Subject. I must however acknowledge, that your good Opinion is flattering to the person who is so happy as to enjoy it, & at the same Time that it exceeds his Merit, it cannot fail of increasing his Desires of deserving it. I mentioned in my last, that Doctor Ban- OCTOBER 12, 1779  croft & Sir James Jay will probably be nominated, if Mr Dana declines his appointment to the office of Secretary; since which the Powers thereof are enlarged with the Commission of Charge D'Affairs, in Case of the absence or Death of the principal, & the office is so desirable as to be sought, by others of Influence & abilities.(2) It is uncertain therefore, who will succeed in the new appointment, & it is for the Interest of the publick, to prevail wth. Mr Dana, if he has any Doubts, to annul them on this Occasion, & accept the office. I am happy to find that the State of Massachusetts has your assistance in forming a Constitution, & am informed, that You are clearly in Favour of giving to the Governor a negative Power, in legislative Matters. This is a great Question, & I am fully persuaded that You have traced it, to its original principles, compared it with the Circumstances of the Times, weighed with Accuracy the advantages & Disadvantages resulting from each Determination thereof, & finally decided in favour of the proposition, but granting, that upon a general Scales the Measure is wise, yet is there not too much Reason to apprehend from it, great Injuries, & that the Community will be endangered, thereby? & may not this be prevented by giving to the Governor a negative only so far as the proceedings of the Legislature may affect the powers of the Executive? Indeed I have but little Time to attend to such Matters, and well knowing your Sentiments to have been on all Occasions against arbitrary & dangerous powers, I am not much concerned about the Event. One Maxim however, in Matters of Government I think to be just, that the Officers are generally best, whose powers are least subject to Abuse. I remain sir with the warmest Sentiments of Friendship & Esteem, your very humble sert, E. Gerry [P.S.] The Salary of a Minister is fixed at £2500 sterling & of his Secretary at £1000.

7992,dg01462,1779,Woodbury Langdon to Meshech Weare,"""Woodbury Langdon to Meshech Weare   Sr. Philadelphia Octobr the 12 1779 The reasons why I have not done myself the honor of writing to you before are these. Soon after my arrival I was taken very ill of a Fever which confined me to my Bed a considerable time and since my recovery General Whipple has gone home who from his long residence and experience at Congress will be able to give you a more perfect Account of the transactions here than can be expected from me. Since my recovery I have attended Congress with the closest application and shall endeavour to exert myself if my health continues to the utmost of my abilites while here. You will have received sundry Resolutions relative to Vermont from the President of Congress a OCTOBER 12, 1779  Copy of the last of which I herein inclose, the others of the 24th September were pass'd while I was confined and I cannot say are altogether to my mind. This Business in my opinion is of the greatest consiquence to New Hampshire and requires her most serious attention for many very weighty Reasons among which give me leave to mention the following. That as the thirteen united States have declared themselves independent which they will beyond all doubt support and at the same time have reserved to each State its particular seperate independence and sovereignty and as New Hampshire without Vermont will be very small and weak compared with her neighbouring States and it cannot be expected in the nature of things but that some day or other differences will arise between that State and her neighbours in which case she will be under great disadvantages on Account of her weakness, it therefore is her indispensable duty in the first seting out to endeavour by all proper means to be as much on a footing with her neighbours as possible, of the truth of this I am more & more convinced every day, it will also give her greater weight in the grand Councils of America and be an amazing saving of Tax-both which are objects well worthy consideration. The same reasons will apply to Vermont against her being a seperate State and in favour of her being connected with New Hampshire, indeed there does not appear to me the least probability that Vermont will be allowed to be a seperate State and every step that has been or may be taken by New Hampshire to countenance it weakens her claim far beyond what many Gentlemen of New Hampshire have any conception of, and will be so construed in disiding the dispute, therefore I wish most heartily that New Hampshire and the Inhabitants of what is called the Grants or Vermont would for the interest of both lay aside every thought of making the latter a seperate State and unite in their endeavours to be one State in which case in my opinon they will succeed, but if Vermont persists in endeavoring to be a seperate State and New Hampshire appears to acquiese they will very likely both be disappointed and in all probability Vermont will be adjudged to New York. I confess I am anxiously concerned for the settlement of this Matter and when I declare that I have no private Interest in the Tract of Country called Vermont and never expect to have it will I flatter myself be admitted that I can have no view seperate from the true Interest of New Hampshire when I endeavour to prevent the Grants from being loped off from New Hampshire of which without vigorous exertions there appears to be danger. The Delegates of New York, Massachusetts Bay and New Hampshire have most of them thought it best to recommend to their several States a particular form of an Act to answer the end of the Resolutions referred to above, in order that there might be a similiarity in the Acts, the Delegates from the two former States have accordingly sent a form of an Act to their respective States, a Copy   of which I have thought it my duty to inclose herein; (1) and the General Court will adopt it or not as they may think proper. If it should be adopted it may be very necessary to add a Clause makeing it of force provided New York and Massachusetts Bay pass similar Acts otherwise not, as it is at present very uncertain what will be done by those States and I hope I shall be pardoned when I say that I hope that care will be taken in forming every part of the Act that no disadvantage or embarrasment may accrue to the State hereafter in consiquence of it. Yesterday was forwarded to you by Express Sundry Resolutions of Congress respecting a Supply of the Treasury, the Letter accompanying them together with the inclosed of the 13th Septr.(2) past sufficiently point out the necessity of the measure without my ading anything on the Subject, it gives me much pain to find that there appears to be a necessity for calling on the States for such large Supplies and confess that I am not without my fears respecting the success of it, but you must see what will be the consiquence if it does not succeed. Your Delegates have been able to procure the Proportion of Tax for New Hampshire to be much lower than what it has hitherto been,(3)but it must be remembered that when hereafter the proportions of the Taxes of each State shall be finally fixed agreable to some former Resolutions of Congress if it shall then appear that New Hampshire or any other State has been dificient it will be then liable to make good such deficiency and on the other hand if any State has been overrated it will have credit for the same. The peculiar situation of my family and other concerns renders it necessary for me to leave this place early in December in order to return home which I hope will not be taken amiss by the Court as they will remember it is agreable to my engagement with them, it will always be the height of my ambition to render the State every possible service in my power-dobtless care will be taken that such Persons are chosen to represent the State in Congress as are fully acquainted with the dispute relative to Vermont and to instruct them fully in that Business.

Since my last Letter to you under the 28th September I have not been honored with any of your favors, nor from a former intimation, could I have expected to hear from you.(1) We remain without any addition to the first advises of Count d'Estaing's arrival near Georgia, this circumstance detains me in Philadelphia, which I cannot conveniently depart from, until I shall have seen & conversed with the Young Gentleman lately appointed Secretary to the Embassy at Versailles,(2) I mean to give him a faithful unbiasing account of Foreign & domestically-transacted-foreign affairs & leave him to judge & determine if he reads my heart he will return thanks & decline acceptance. You will receive with this a Copy of the Journal containing the Yeas & Nays formerly spoken of, the different principles alluded to by a Note in the Margin were-J thought 10 or 15 by far too little. L was of opinion that anything would be too much.(3) The Report for which a certain Monday was \""set apart\"" remains unconsidered & probably will remain so to the day of Judgement. Yesterday I received Packets & Letters ten in number directed to yourself & Colo. F. L. Lee from France which I have delivered to Mr. Lovel who has shewn me Copies of two which will be read this Morning in Congress, I shall move to have them printed, if refused, & I can obtain Copies, they shall be printed-Mr. Lovel will enlarge on these points.(4) The P.S. to my Letter above recited informs you that I had paused upon the propriety of transmitting a Paper which had been inclosed,(5) upon mature reflection & considering circumstances which have since happened I see nothing improper in it, therefore I shall inclose it with this in its original state, probably it may at this distance of time convey no information. The Salaries to Ministers Plenipo: £2500 Sterling per Annum, to their Secretaries f 1000-in full of all expences &c. passages excepted. I moved for £2000 & £700 & was uniformly no! against everything higher & my motives & reasonings I trust will meet the approbation of my thinking fellow Citizens-we have made the appointments where are the funds? Mr. Carmichael had no competitor, but I refused my Vote;(6) upon proper reflection I am persuaded he himself will applaud my candor & I will take the liberty of adding, my judgement. He who had repeatedly acknowledged that he had called an American Minister in Office a Rascal & did not deny that he had called him Villain too & said he would display his Villainy to Congress, must  OCTOBER 12, 1779  have been either right or wrong. I need not deduce the logical conclusion, I think I have acted as if I understood it. The two Legs are made Ult. but yesterday there was a proposition for reconsidering & expunging the Southernmost, I opposed it, after an hours debate, adjourned-we shall hear more of it today.(7) I told the advocate for expunction, I had long since heard every word he had offered in support of his motion-out of doors.

7996,dg01466,1779,Henry Marchant to William Greene,"""Henry Marchant to William Greene   Sir, Philadelphia Octr. 12th 1779 Mr. Collins sat out last Tuesday for Providence, meaning however to take the Camp in his Tour; and proposed to wait there a few Days for Count De Staing's Arrival, and to put himself on Board if possible. Before the Receipt of this your Excellency will have recd. the Address of Congress, and the late subsequent Resolutions calling upon the States for all future Supplies. Your Excellency will perceive that from an Arbitrary and unreasonable Depretiation of the Currency, no Ways proportioned to the Emissions, the amasing high Prices have caused the-monthly Expenditures for the Support of the Army & the Common Cause to be very enormous. It cannot be doubted,  OCTOBER 12, 1779  but that the very Assessment of those Taxes, at least the first & second monthly Collections must have an Effect upon Prices and appretiate the Currency, as soon as this shall be happily effected; I should presume that Congress will be able proportionably to relax in the future Taxes. As the State I have the Honor to represent has hitherto taken more than its Proportion of Taxes, and its Situation from the Invasion of the Enemy, and the Consequent scattering of a great Part of its Inhabitants, and other Considerations have most severely distressed the State-I was so happy as to prevail in reducing Our Proportion of the Taxes for the Year 1780 One third less than heretofore. (1) Should the Enemy at Rhode Island either be taken, or find themselves constrained to evacuate it-the State will have an Opportunity, if they shall see proper so to enlarge their Taxes as in some Measure to lighten their own internal Debt. For while on the one Hand we feel the Weight of the present Taxes it will be plainly seen that, Monies will never be raised with more ease than when the Currency is in its greatest depretiated State. That Time I must presume is now, For I must please myself with the Reflection that the Virtue, Generosity & Patriotism of my Countrymen will strike a most decisive Stroke to the last Hopes of Our Enemies, which are alone built on the Destruction of Our Currency, and will by the most vigorous Measures, and by almost any temporal Sacrifice regain a Confidence in the Currency, which shall confound Our Enemies, and speedily establish Peace, Liberty and Independance to the United States. The first Sacrifice is allways the cheapest-And the Way to preserve our Property & thereby enrich Ourselves is to make a great present Sacrifice of partial Interest. The State of New Jersey have addressed Congress in the strongest Terms upon the Subject of regulating Prices and pray that Congress will take it into serious Consideration, and recommend a Plan for that Purpose to all the States. Indeed New-Jersey never repealed their Former Act, but suspended it only till as they say the Wisdom of the other States should perceive as they do the absolute Expediency of the Measure. Congress have committed the Address of New Jersey to a Committee of one Member from each State. The Legislature of New-Jersey have sent forward to the Delegates of all the States in Congress, an Address to every State, requesting that those Addresses may be forwarded by the Delegates of their Respective States, And I have accordingly enclosed One to your Excellency.(2) Should such a Measure take Place; the Expenditures would be diminished, and Taxes I presume proportionably lessened. I should be glad of the Sense of my Constituents upon so important a Subject. Should I not receive any-I shall endeavour to act from such Principles, as I conceive were the Inducements in their late Transactions in Convention. We are in momentary Expectations of hearing of the Count De Staing near these Shores. We have no late official Accounts. Report  says that an Attack had been made upon the Garrison at Beaufort, that after an Action of three Hours & a Quarter, it was carried, Nine hundred of the Enemy made Prisoners-All their Baggage & Stores taken, & their Shiping there destroyed-That the Count had ordered his Ships up the Savannah to cooperate with Genl. Lincoln. A few Days must give us full Information. Our Affairs Abroad are in the most prosperous Train. Most of the European Powers wish us well, and if all of them do not, we know of no Enemy but Britain- And we know not that they have a Friend in Heaven or Earth. It behoves us however to be our Own Friend-so may we expect the further Blessing of Heaven & the Completion-a happy Completion to the glorious struggle and I trust Heaven is ready to hand it out to Us as soon as we shall be fully disposed to receive it. That so glorious is the sincere prayer of Your Excellencys most obedient & very humble Servt. Hy. Marchant P.S. I enclose your Excellency the Weekly Journals of Congress in Course down to the 28th of August. ""

8015,dg01485,1779,John Armstrong Sr to George Washington,"""John Armstrong, Sr., to George Washington   Dear General Philada. 15th Octobr. 1779. The Counts expected approach to these Shores begins to be thought tedious, but the lodgment of the Enemy to the South being in two places considerably distant from each other, I'm persuaded no time has yet elapsed wherein we cou'd reasonably look for an Official account of that event. A letter from Hampdon of the 9th Inst. asserts the certainty of a compleat Capture of Provosts [Prevost's] Army & various Vessels &c. which however doubted by many I'm inclined to think favourably of as our late Southerly winds might give a quick passage to that intelligence. You know Sir that the present moment however premature will create military Speculation-Some that a great Post or two will fall, Others that it's impossible otherwise than by Starving, or at least that the Sacrifice must be too great-Again-the attack must be general and uniform by Land & Water &c &c. I dare not with so imperfect knowledge of the situation &c. form an Idea of either a general or particular Rule in a great effort, but pray god to form & determine for you, but confess the Idea of piece-male work Strikes me as naturally as any other, that is the Operation of the Fleet upon that of the Enemies-first removing out of the way Such batterries as may be practicable & by which the inbound passage of the Shiping may be much Obstructed. So much for guess work. A Sufficient Supply of Provisions and ammunition are important points, the former very clearly and Seasonably pointed out by your Excellency which from the distance and Small Stock on hand requires faithfull attention. I am much pleased that Governor Ried will command his Own Militia. (1) OCTOBER 15, 1779  It has not been in my power with any degree of facility, yet to get on the farther Subsistance for the General Officers of the Army, but a good foundation is laid for it, and a Short time will bring it on I hope to their Satisfaction without the necessity of a memorial.(2) A farther provision for the Surgeons of the Hospital, has been already committed and will probably soon be reported. Mr. Gerard & Mr. Jay sets out in two or three days-preparations for foreign Courts & the revision of Some points formerly determined, has of late much engrossed the attention of Congress, in which I cannot but apprehend that rather hard measure has fallen to the Lot of Dr Lee. The Late appointment of Mr. John Adams may Serve as a Spunge to wipe of the Stain of culpable neglect-a tryal this Sufficient in my Opinion to all that gentlemans gravity and plain brown hair. 22. Permit me to recommend to the honor of yr. Excellencies acquaintance my good hibernian friend Doctor Shiell, and thro' your farther polite offices to the General Officers of the Pennsylvania Line, to whom at present I cannot write. The Doctor is a Young Gentleman of liberal Sentiments & education possessed of a handsome fortune, a warm Whigg & a man of Sense. I am now leaving Congress having exerted the last dregs of any remaining talent I had under various impediments.(3) Finance, (for which I never had any talent) is the only present ghost that Stares every honest man in the face. Taxation, altho' the radical means of appreciation as well as of the payment of publick debt, is a remedy too remote for our Support. The disease has ran too long to be overtaken by any common cure. A general regulation of prices by Law is said to be impracticable. I have therefore wished to throw out some higher inducement to money holders on lone than any yet offered rather than the Ship Shou'd get aground, but a large majority thought the present offers sufficient to procure all we shou'd want untill supplyed by Tax. The expectation is futile & without political foundation. I presume however that some new push will be made for a foreign Loan. Retrenchment of expences is in it's place highly necessary & Sooner or later a great Share of the burthen of such a plan is likely to fall upon you, which rather ought to be done by others. I shall take the liberty of amusing you a moment in reading the inclosed,(4) only because it is the clearest account of the occasions of the late misfortune at Penobscot that has yet reached this place, and as likely to be true. Major Armstrong on that occasion has been indulging young ambition in following that Army, I suppose with Jacksons Regimt. and probably without the approbation of Genl. Gates, until the wiser winds corrected the error. I am with perfect respect & every wish for your Safety & Success- Your Excellency's Most Obedient humbl. Servt.

The United states are sincerely desirous of peace and wish by every means consistent with their dignity and safety to spare the further effusion of blood. They have therefore by your commission and these instructions laboured to remove the obstacles to that event before the enemy have evidenced their disposition for it. But as the great object of the present defensive war on the part of the allies is to establish the independence of the united states, and as any treaty, whereby this end cannot be obtained, must be only ostensible and illusory, you are therefore to make it a preliminary article to any negotiation, That Great Britain shall agree to treat with the united states as Sovereign, free and independent. Secondly. You Shall take especial care also, that the independence of the said States be effectually assured and confirmed by the treaty or treaties of peace, according to the form and effect of the treaty of alliance with his most Christian Majesty; & you shall not agree to such treaty or treaties, unless the same be thereby so assured and confirmed. Thirdly. The boundaries of these states are as follows viz, These States are bounded, North, by a line to be drawn from the Northwest angle of Nova Scotia along the highlands, which divide those rivers which empty themselves into the river St. Lawrence from those which fall into the Atlantic Ocean, to the northwestermost head of Connecticut river, thence down along the middle of that river to the forty fifth degree of North latitude, thence due west in the latitude forty five degrees north from the equator to the Northwestermost side of the river St. Lawrence or Cadaraqui, thence straight to the south end of lake Nipissing, and thence straight to the source of the river Mississippi; West, by a line to be drawn along the middle of the river Mississippi from its source to where the said line shall intersect the thirty first degree of North latitude: South, by a line to be drawn due east from the termination of the line last mentioned in the latitude of thirty one degrees north from the equator to the middle of the river Appalachicola or Catahouchi, thence along the middle thereof to its junction with the Flint river, thence straight to the head of St Mary's river and thence down along the middle of St. Mary's river to the Atlantic Ocean: and East, by a line to be drawn along the middle of St. John's river from its source to its mouth in the bay of Fundy; comprehending all islands within twenty leagues of any part of the shores of the United states and lying between lines to be drawn due east from the points where the aforesaid boundaries OCTOBER 16, 1779  between Nova Scotia on the one part and East Florida on the other part shall respectively touch the bay of Fundy and Atlantic Ocean. You are therefore strongly to contend that the whole of the said countries and islands Iying within the boundaries aforesaid and every citadel, fort, post, place, harbour and road to them belonging be absolutely evacuated by the land and sea forces of his Britannic Majesty and yielded to the powers of the states to which they respectively belong, in such situation as they may be, at the termination of the war. But notwithstanding the clear right of these states and the importance of the object, yet they are so much influenced by the dictates of religion and humanity and so desirous of complying with the earnest requests of their allies, that if the line to be drawn from the mouth of the lake Nipissing to the head of the Mississippi cannot be obtained without continuing the war for that purpose, you are hereby empowered to agree to some other line between that point and the river Mississippi, provided the same shall in no part thereof be to the southward of latitude forty five degrees north: And in like manner, if the eastern boundary above described cannot be obtained you are hereby empowered to agree, that the same shall be afterwards adjusted by commissioners to be duly appointed for that purpose according to such line as shall be by them settled and agreed on as the boundary between that part of the State of Massachusetts bay formerly called the province of Maine and the colony of Nova Scotia agreeably to their respective rights: And you may also consent that the enemy shall destroy such fortifications as they may have erected. Fourthly. Although it is of the utmost importance to the peace and commerce of the united states, that Canada and Nova Scotia should be ceded and more particularly that their equal common right to the fisheries should be guarantied to them, yet a desire of terminating the war hath induced us not to make the acquisition of these objects an ultimatum on the present occasion. Fifthly. You are empowered to agree to a cessation of hostilities during the negotiation, provided our ally shall consent to the same, and provided it shall be stipulated that all the forces of the enemy shall be immediately withdrawn from the United States. Sixthly. In all other matters not abovementioned you are to govern yourself by the alliance between his most Christian Majesty and these states; by the advice of our allies; by your knowledge of our interests, and by your own discretion, in which we repose the fullest confidence. Done at Philadelphia this sixteenth day of October in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy nine and in the fourth year of our Independence.

8022,dg01492,1779,Samuel Huntington to John Adams,"""Samuel Huntington to John Adams   Sir, [October 16, 1779] You will herewith receive a commission giving you full power to negotiate a treaty of Commerce with Great Britain,(1) in doing which you will consider yourself bound by the following information and instructions.(2) First. You will govern yourself principally by the treaty of Commerce with his most Christian Majesty; and as on the one hand, you shall grant no privilege to Great Britain not granted by that treaty to France, so on the other, you shall not consent to any peculiar restrictions or limitations whatever in favour of Great Britain. Secondly. In Order that you may be the better able to act with propriety on this occasion, it is necessary for you to know that we have determined. 1st. That the common right of fishing shall in no case be given up. 2. That it is essential to the welfare of all these United States, that the inhabitants thereof, at the expiration of the war should continue to enjoy the free and undisturbed exercise of their common right to fish on the bank of Newfoundland and the other fishing banks and seas of North America preserving inviolate the treaties between France and the said States. 3. That application shall be made to his most Christian Majesty to agree to some article or articles for the better securing to these States a share in the said fisheries. 4. That if after a treaty of peace with Great Britain, she shall molest the citizens or inhabitants of any of the united States in taking fish on the banks and places herein after described, such molestation, being in our Opinion a direct violation and breach of the peace, shall be a common cause of the said states and the force of the union be exerted to obtain redress for the parties injured. And 5. That our faith be pledged to the several states, that without their unanimous consent no treaty of commerce shall be entered into, nor any trade or commerce whatever carried on with Great Britain without the explicit stipulation herein after mentioned. You are therefore not to consent to any treaty of commerce with Great Britain without an explicit stipulation on her part not to molest or disturb the inhabitants of the united states of America in taking fish on the banks of Newfoundland and other fisheries in the American seas anywhere, excepting within the distance of three leagues of the shores OCTOBER 16, 1779  of the territories remaining to Great Britain at the close of the war, if a nearer distance cannot be obtained by negotiation: And in the negotiation you are to exert your most strenuous endeavours to obtain a nearer distance in the gulf of St Lawrence and particularly along the shores of Nova Scotia, as to which latter, we are desirous that even the shores may be occasionally used for the purpose of carrying on the fisheries by the inhabitants of these states. Thirdly. In all other matters you are to govern yourself by your own discretion as shall be most for the interest of these States, taking care that the said treaty be founded on principles of equality and reciprocity so as to conduce to the mutual advantage of both nations, but not to the exclusion of others. Done at Philadelphia this sixteenth day of Octr. in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy nine and in the fourth year of our Independence.

Congress is sensible of the friendly regard to these states manifested by hi, Most Christian Majesty in reserving a power to his Catholic  OCTOBER 16, 1779  Majesty of acceding to the alliance entered into between his Most Christian Majesty and these united states; And therefore that nothing may be wanting on their part to facilitate the views of his Most Christian Majesty and to obtain a treaty of alliance and of amity and commerce with his catholic Majesty, have thought proper to anticipate any propositions which his Catholic Majesty might make on that subject by yielding up to him those objects which they conclude he may have principally in view, and for that purpose have come to the following resolution, \""That if his Catholic Majesty shall accede to the said treaties and in concurrence with France and the united states of America continue the present war with Great Britain for the purpose expressed in the treaties aforesaid, he shall not thereby be precluded from securing to himself the Floridas; on the contrary if he shall obtain the Floridas from great Britain, these united states will guaranty the same to his catholic Majesty; provided always that the united states shall enjoy the free navigation of the river Mississippi into and from the sea.\"" You are therefore to communicate to his most Christian Majesty the desire of Congress to enter into a treaty of alliance and of Amity and commerce with his Catholic Majesty and to request his favourable interposition for that purpose; At the same time you are to make such proposals to his Catholic Majesty as in your judgment, from circumstances will be proper for obtaining for the united states of America equal advantages with those, which are secured to them by the treaties with his most Christian Majesty, observing always the resolution aforesaid as the ultimatum of these united states. You are particularly to endeavour to obtain some convenient port or ports below the 31st degree of north latitude on the river Mississippi free for all merchant vessels, goods, wares and merchandizes belonging to the inhabitants of these states. The distressed state of our finances & the great depreciation of our paper money incline Congress to hope that his Catholic Majesty, if he shall conclude a treaty with these states, will be induced to lend them money; You are therefore to represent to him the great distress of these states on that account, and to solicit a loan of five million of dollars upon the best terms in your power not exceeding six per centum per annum, effectually to enable them to co-operate with the allies against the common enemy. But before you make any propositions to his Catholic Majesty for a loan, you are to endeavour to obtain a subsidy in consideration of the guaranty aforesaid. \ You are to use your utmost endeavours for obtaining permission for the citizens and inhabitants of these States to lade and take on board their vessels Salt at the island of Salt Tortuga; and also to cut, load and bring away Logwood and Mohogony in and from the bay of Hondurus and its rivers and to build on the shores storehouses and Magazines for the woodcutters and their families in the extent   ceded to his Britannic Majesty by the seventeenth Article of the definitive treaty concluded at Paris the tenth day of February 1763 or in as great extent as can be obtained.(2) Given at Philadelphia this sixteenth day of October in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy nine and in the fourth year of our Independence, by the Congress of the united States of America.

I have reason to believe that few, if any, of your Letters to me within a Year & half last past have miscarried, I have received originals or Copies a great many during my residence in this State. You have been long & anxiously conjecturing upon the cause of silence on my side, I will tell you in a few words-my close attachment to the service of America has shut out every other consideration, I am as ignorant of the state of my private affairs in South Carolina as you are. You know as well as I do, that our worthy friends Mr. Manigault & Mr. Gervais act as my Attornies, & you also know as well as I do, what have been the products of my Estates, at what prices such products have sold, what Monies have been paid or received on my Account. I have not received a single Account in the course of near 2 1/2 Years. Another cause of my silence I believe has been a dread of having my Letters intercepted & published in all the News Papers of England & New York, a practice which was early adopted by both parties of the present contention-but neither public avocations nor any other consideration shall hinder me from embracing this favorable opportunity of paying my respects to you, chiefly to inform you that I am now on the point of returning to my own Country, where, if I continue to enjoy good health I will reassume the charge of your affairs & from whence you shall hear from me by every proper conveyance. Your Nephew Colonel Laurens, was well on the 7th Sepr & was then going towards Savanna to take a command. I expect every hour OCTOBER 18, 1779  to hear from or of him, the intermediate moments will not pass altogether free from anxiety. I might, if it were proper, give you a long detail of American public affairs, but omission, appears to me to be best & safest at present, in general they wear an aspect which the most sanguine had no foresight or conception of in 1774. An aspect, which if Great Britain were truly informed of would induce her for her own sake & for the sake of humanity, to withdraw her forces & to spare the lives of her own subjects. Sound Policy would dictate, That it is high time, having a view to her own Interest only, to effect with the United States of America, a reconciliation according to the fashion of Independent Nations. Present me in the most affectionate terms to my Dear Sister & to my daughters, be assured that to bear the cruel seperation which I have experienced, requires all the fortitude I am possessed of, to bear it with perfect equanimity requires a degree of Stoicism which I am not possessed of. I am sometimes tempted, at all hazards, to make a Voyage to France & tis' far from impossible, I may carry this wish into effect before June next. My Dear Brother I pray God to bless & protect you, & I remain with the most sincere affection Your faithful freind & obedient servant. Henry Laurens ""

Since the date of my last of the 26th September I have not been honoured with any of Your Excellency's favors. After repeated tenders to Congress of the Letters which Your Excellency desired should be presented to the House I obtained, about a week ago, a Commit- OCTOBER 19, 1779  ment of them without reading. Yesterday I put them into the hands of Mr. President Huntington when they were read & again Committed,(1) therefore they are now out of my reach, otherwise they should have accompanied this, the translation of the Dutch Book goes on slowly. Mr. Muhlenburg who was so obliging as to undertake to get that work performed says the translator is nevertheless not Idle. I should have explained on the first abovementioned Commitment by saying the Committee had made a favorable Report on the Letters & then returned them into my hands. I was desirous because you seem to have been so, & because the Letters deserved attention, to have them read in full Congress. This was done yesterday & thence came the second Commitment. When I said to Your Excellency in my last \""were he my Son I should dissuade him,\"" I had no Idea that my Son would indeed be made without his knowledge, a Candidate for the very place, your Son wished for. My declaration was very sincere & my subsequent conduct consistent therewith. I do not beleive Colo. Laurens will accept the appointment which Congress have elected him to.(2) I have written to him desiring he will not determine until he shall have given me an opportunity of conferring with him & communicating a faithful & accurate state of our affairs foreign & domestic. If it shall please God to favor me with such an interview, & that my Son can read my heart he will return thanks to Congress & decline accepting the intended honor. At the same time I must confess that as far as I know him he does not want qualifications for filling the Office of Secretary to a foreign embassy with Credit, but a Man tender of his reputation will well consider the times before he accepts of a place. Your Excellency's Packet addressed to the Baron Van der Capellen is committed to the protection of Monsr. Gerard with a particular request to convey it in such manner as to avoid a heavy expence of Postage; Mr. Gerard is now on board the Confederacy at Chester & will sail with the first fair Wind, probably this day. If the intelligence which we have received through various Channels of the Count d'Estaing's success at South Carolina & Georgia shall prove true, those States will enjoy a temporary tranquility & the Enemy will feel the weight of a heavy loss & severe mortification; according to those accounts, we have ground for expecting to hear of the Admiral's arrival at Sandyhook or Rhode Island to day or to morrow. All this looks very fair-but alas! alas! We are threatned with an empty Treasury before the 1st day of December-vigoros & virtues exertions of the Citizens of these States, immediately put into action, must so far heal the wound given by rash bad policy as to save us from a violent convulsion. Your Excellency has before this day seen the Plan of ways & means, the medicine is rather rude, but if it be taken in time & in chearful spirits it may produce much relief, but cannot perform a radical cure. How is that possible when the expel-  daters continue to increase beyond the stretch of the amazing expected returns of 15 Mil. per Month-it will however afford us a little time for breathing & recollection, & will stimulate the States to look a little more narrowly into things which concern their temporal Salvation. I am with the utmost Esteem & Regard, Sir, Your Excellency's Obedient & most humble, servant, Henry Laurens. ""

The Instant I came into the House I was placed upon an important Committee (1) & that succeeded by a Variety of others so that I am already again distracted with Attention to different Things. Can you give me as good Reasons for your Taciturnity? I fear not. Remember that domestic ones cannot be received for that I shall set off like domestic Cares. Our Politics and our News are now alike public. The mighty Questions which have agitated us & tone the People of America settle down to a Calm. We hope much, expect much and are Certain of this only That every Thing in this World is uncertain. There is from thence a strong Argument for acting inconclusively and so inconclusive an Animal is Man that it is kind to have found the Argumts. for him. Adieu my dear Friend.

8053,dg014123,1779,Henry Laurens to George Washington,"""Henry Laurens to George Washington   Dear sir. Philadelphia 24th October 1779. I had the honor of addressing you in a Letter under the 7th & 9th Inst. which went forward by a Messenger from the Dep. Qu. Master's office. (1) Yesterday I received from Charles Town in South Carolina by a Letter & News Papers, intelligence in brief, of the operations of the combined arms in & near Georgia to the 2d Inst. Colo. Maitland with so many of his Troops as were inclined & able had made his escape from Beaufort & joined General Prevost at Savanna leaving behind him, his whole Hospital, Artillery, Baggage & Stores. I know the swamps which the Colonel must have penetrated; a detail of his line of March, if he really went that way, would excite a mixture of compassion & laughter. The Enemy were strongly fortified by lines & redoubts in the Town of Savanna, where the soil is sand & sandy clay-their number about 3000, exclusive of Negroes & other rubbage. Count d'Estaing had landed 5000 Troops & formed a junction with General Lincoln who must have had under his command about 4000. Count Pulaski & General McKintosh had been detached southerly, probably to secure the Town of Sunbury about 40 Miles distant from Savanna & to intercept retreating parties by land & inland navigation, which in that country may be attempted with great prospect of success. The allies finding General Prevost so strongly intrenched had determind after a fruitless summon[s] to make regular approaches in preference to assault, Colo. Lomoy chief Engineer had announced that his works would be complete on the 1st October & it was expected, the Batteries consisting of 38 pieces of heavy Cannon & 8 Mortars would open in the same instant on the 2d or 3d. Sorties in two attempts had been made by the beseiged on the working parties, in both instances the assailants were beat back & suffered greatly in killed & wounded. A flag had passed from Gen. Prevost to Count d'Estaing with a request from the General for a Passport in favor of Madame Prevost, her plate & effects. The Count had replied that his politeness so far as respected the Lady could not be questioned, but that he understood the Plate &ca. had been acquired in such a way from the Allies of his Master as induced him OCTOBER 24, 1779  to believe the General could not in honor & conscience expect to enjoy it-or something like this. The Sagitaire had taken the Experiment commanded by Sir James Wallace after a brave resistance, it is said that on board the Experiment were General Vaughan & about 20 other Officers, & Cash for paying the British Troops in Georgia, that dispatches had been found on board intimating an embarkation of 4000 Men at New York intended for So Carolina in consequence of which ten Ships of the line had been detached for convoying them in-this may account for the fleet which lately appeared at the mouth of Chesepeak. The Ariel, Fowey, & a sloop of 18 Guns, British Men of War, a large Ship with 2200 Barrels of Bread & flour, a large quantity of Beef & Pork, 4000 suits of Clothing &c. &c.-all the Enemy's Store & Transport Ships had fallen into the French Admiral's hands, besides many others Captured at Sea. Mr. Alexander Cameron formerly British Deputy, now, Superintendent of Indian affairs in the Southern district had prevailed on a part of the Cherokees to break faith with South Carolina, these had been severely chastised by General Williamson, their Towns & provisions totally destroyed & Cameron driven out of the Nation-the General had returned & would join General Lincoln with about 1000 Men on the 29th or 30th September. The Camps of the Allies in perfect health & harmony & every body in full prospect of repossessing Savanna & of having the British General, his Troops & the wrong Governor Sir James Wright prisoners of War within a week. Your Excellency well knows how to make proper abatements from such jumbled accounts-the bulk I believe to be true & there are no doubt many favorable truths untold. \""I have not heard (says my friend) from Colo. Laurens since he went to Georgia he commands the Light Infantry, but by Letters to others I learn he was well the 27th Septem. after the reduction of Savanna he intends to return to his General.\"" This is all I have received concerning Your Excellency's Aid de Camp, my friend adds that deserters from the Enemy came in daily. On Thursday last Congress were pleased to appoint me to go to the United States of Holland, when I am informed of the nature & extent of commands to be laid on me,(3)I shall be better qualified to determine on the propriety of accepting the Charge, be this as it may, I mean to begin my journey towards South Carolina on the 29th Inst.(3) There & in every other place where God pleases to lead me I shall continue to bear a grateful remembrance of Your Excellency's paternal care of my Country & shall count every opportunity of testifying my Love & Esteem for you an happy event.

Washington's letter dated the 21st Inst.(2) we learn that the Enemy have demolished and evacuated their posts of Stoney and Verplanks point, and retreated to New York. By intelligence of the 15th from Genl. Gates we learn there was reason to believe that the Enemy were about to evacuate Rhode Island and repair to New York where OCTOBER 24, 1779  it appears the Enemy are centering all their force in order to make the greatest possible defence against Count de Estaing and Genl. Washington. The Enemy have sunk several hulks of vessels in the channel at the narrows & have made strong works on Long Island Staten & Governors Island. Inasmuch as the season is far advanced we have no reason to be very sanguine about possessing ourselves of New York.

"
8056,dg014126,1779,Thomas Burke to the North Carolina Assembly,"""Thomas Burke to the North Carolina Assembly   [October 25 ? 1779] (1) Among the variety of Business which came before Congress from the begining of January '79 to the midle of August, the following Objects Seemed to your Delegates to be of highest Importance to the united States in general. The Army, Finances, and foreign affairs. The Votes and transactions relative to the two first are to be found in the Journals, Copies of which are transmitted to the Governor for the use of the State. I (2) presume therefore that your Delegates are not required to give any particular Information relative to them unless Some passages require Explanation, or their own particular Votes Stand in need of Justification. If Such be the Case, I hope and  OCTOBER 25, 1779  request that they may be Questioned on Such Votes and passages specially, praying leave to Suggest that any other mode would be tedious, difficult and unsatisfactory and Protesting that I am at all times ready and willing to give all the Satisfaction in my power to the Assembly in any mode which shall to that honorable Body Seem Most eligeable. I am aware that Some obvious remarks which will Occur on perusing the Journals require Answers and will Endeavour to give Such as appear to me true, and hope they will prove Satisfactory. Tis obvious that much time is Spent on unimportant Subjects, that many Questions of Order are debated and some of them perhaps decided in a manner that may appear extraordinary to Legislative Assemblies. The latter is Occasioned by the Nature of Congress which is a deliberating Executive assembly, to whose proceedings the rules of order Established for deliberating Legislative assemblies will not always apply without manifest Inconvenience and as utility is the principle which gives rise to all rules of order, So whatever rule appears to a Majority to be Contrary to utility must Necessarily be rejected as not order. It must be Confessed, and ought to be lamented that those Circumstances make the rules of order in that assembly very arbitrary and uncertain-hence frequent disputes arise thereon, much time and debate are wasted, and the decisions at length depend upon the Integrity of a Majority. Thus rules of Order Cease to be, what they ought, Common Checks upon Excesses; and, being always in the power of a Majority, if that Should be factious or Vitious will be unavailing against them, but always powerful Instruments in their hands. This Inconvenience Can only be remedied by fundamental alterations in the Constitution of Congress, which ought to be beyond their own power to alter except by unanimous Consent-but the present times afford not leisure for Such Improvements, and tis to be hoped that the Virtue of the present race will prevent any great degree of Injury, before a Season of Tranquility Shall arrive. The former arises also from the Imperfect Constitution Of Congress which cannot reject any Business, addressed to them by way of despatch through the President, before it has undergon Some Consideration. When Such applications respect the Interests of Individuals it too often happens that Some Member patronises the application, and a Debate Necessarily Ensues which consumes much time, for it must be Confessed that particular Interests are too frequently very Strenuously Contested and the very Effort to get rid of Such applications in order to make way for more Important Business takes up a great part of that time which ought to be Sacred to great and general Concerns. Your Delegates with great pleasure assisted in passing a resolution to Correct this Evil in Some Measure Vizt that on a motion for postponing no member Should Speak more than Once,(3) and they have had the Satisfaction of observing OCTOBER 25. 1779  very good Effects from it, the House being thereby enabled to come to a resolution for dismissing improper business, with much less Debate, and waste of time than heretofore. As the most Effectual remedy for this Evil, it is much to be wished that the Delegates in Congress were free from the Solicitations of Interested Individuals, or immoveably firm against them, either, tho much to be wished for, yet, Considering the frailty of human Nature, Can Scarcely be expected, and the remedy for this Evil like many others must be referred to Seasons of Sufficient Tranquility for fundamental Amendments . In general with respect to the army your Delegates relied on the approved Experience, Abilities and Virtue of its Illustrious Commander for all Military Enterprises and Operations. In what related to arrangements and appointments, they always favored whatever tended to make their Condition more Comfortable and Satisfactory, whatever tended to hold out prospects of future glory and Competence to the gallant and faithful Soldier. But they were careful to admit no Ideas of Power in the Military Order repugnant to, or interefering with the Civil Authority, nor Insolence to the Civil Magistrate of any State to pass with impunity,(4) and they always Opposed every attempt to exercise Arbitrary Acts of Power over any military person, always Stedfastly maintaining that a Soldier does not forego the rights of a free Citizen by taking arms in defence of his Country. That the rules of his Conduct, mode of his trial, and measure of his punishments aught to be found in the promulgated Civil and military Codes, to the former of which he has given the general Consent of a Citizen, and to the latter by Subscribing the articles the particular Consent of a Soldier. Your Delegates are happy in the Conviction that in all that relates to this important object they maintained principles, and observed a Conduct Consonant to the Ideas of their Constituents, of which they Consider as Cogent proofs the Several acts of assembly made in favor of that Useful, Virtuous and Meritorious part of our fellow Citizens who are Chearfully undergoing all the Dangers and distresses of Military Service for their Country and they beg leave to express their Concern that those acts are not in all things Executed so as to give the full Effect to the liberality of the assembly. With respect to finance your Delegates were of Opinion that the public Credit ought to be maintained by very Copious Taxation, well knowing that the ability to pay Taxes must always increase in proportion to the Increase of money, and much wishing that Taxes might have the Salutary Effect, of diverting much of that time which is now wasted every where in America in blameable Idleness, or frivolous Amusements, to Industrious Exertions for Increasing the resources of our Country. They also wished to Correct the abuses in the Expenditure of public Money, but I am Sorry today that such abuses are So Inveterate that they admit of no adequate Cure but from   Vigorous Exertions of the States to furnish the Necessary Supplies in kind according to their respective abilities. All the Efforts of Congress have been directed to the lessening of Expenditures, to the procuring of Supplies of money by Loans and Taxes, and by Such means to prevent further Emissions. But all their Efforts must prove Ineffectual, if Not powerfully aided by Similar Efforts of the States for Carrying their resolutions into Execution . Many States are availing themselves of the present plenty of money for the raising as much as possible by Taxes. The advantage of Such policy and the Injury of delaying Taxation until the Money becomes more difficult to be obtained, your Delegates presume are obvious, and cannot escape the Sagacity of the General Assembly. What relates to foreign affairs being preserved in the Secret Journals of Congress will require a more particular detail, and I will here give as full a relation as the Injunctions of Secrecy which [I] am under will permit. Premising, that tho I hold myself not at liberty to declare any thing which I have been enjoined to keep Secret, unless I perceive its tendency to be Injurious to my Constituents; or, unless I am particularly required by the Assembly to lay such matters before them without reserve, Yet in Such Cases I Consider the obligation I am under to my Constituents, Superior to any which can be laid on me by Congress.(5) But in the Conduct of Wars, and foreign Negotiations many things will Occur which if divulged might lose every beneficial Effect, and produce Consequences very Injurious to the general Welfare. Such it is to be presumed no one State would require to be divulged, unless their own peculiar Safety made it Necessary, and I am too well Convinced of the Wisdom, discretion and public Spirit of my Constituents, to doubt their permitting Silence on all affairs of Such Nature. The foreign affairs have been Considered in Congress under two general Heads-the State and dispositions of foreign Courts; the Conduct and Character of our foreign Ministers-and each afforded very Interesting objects, and produced long protracted Questions and debates. With respect to the Conduct of our foreign Ministers It was So Indiscreet that dissentions and Animosities had arisen amongst them which produced reciprocal Suspicions and Accustations. Nor had they the prudence to Suppress or Conceal them, on the Contrary, they Suffered them to break out into heats and altercations disgraceful to the Country in whose Service they were. The Consequence was, that they (lost the Confidence of the Court at which they resided and) became almost useless. Doctr F. & Mr Dean who principally conducted our affairs at the Court of Versails Seemed to act in perfect Harmony, and to be fully possessed of the Confidence of the Court. Doctor Lee who was Joint Commissioner with them, accused them both of peculation, and Criminal waste and misapplication of public money. Mr. Dean Accused  Doctor Lee of being Froward, proud, Supercilious, Malevolent, Suspicious to So unreasonable a degree as to take unfounded Conjectures for facts, and to draw from them uncandid and disengenuous Conclusions-with all, to be of a temper Sordid and disgusting- and by his Correspondence and Connexitions with British Subjects and Emissaries to have become Suspected by the French Court of Infidelity-and Doctor Franklin Considered the same Gentleman as laboring under a Disorder of his Understanding. The appointments of the other Gentlemen were found to have been Useless and their part in the Enquiries, and proceedings of Congress, being inconsiderable it Seems enough to Inform the Assembly that they were discontinued in office. The Congress made a very Minute and painful Enquiry Concerning all the allegations of the different accusers and accused, but So deficient were they in Matterials for affording Testimony that no Satisfaction Could be obtained with respect to the guilt or Innocence of any.(6) Mr Dean alledged that his accounts would very fully refute the charge of Mr. Lee, but that not knowing that he was recalled for any other purpose than to give Congress Information of the Political State of Europe as it affected the united States, and being desirous of giving them Satisfaction without delay, and of hastning the Departure of Count DeEstaing for America with the fleet under his Command, he did not take time to Settle them before he left France.(7) The accusations against him were founded upon Conjectures, Surmises and Inuendoes, and the Settlement of his accounts would Certainly prove either his guilt or Innocence, but they were in france, and all farther proceeding became impossible So that the Sense of Congress on the indisputable Merit of Mr Dean as our Assiduous, able, faithful, and Successful Minister Could not with propriety be given while he lay under So heavy a Charge as that of peculation. Doctor Franklin was involved with Mr Dean. The Charges against Doctor Lee were no better Supported, and he himself was not present to answer. Upon the whole it appear'd to your Delegates, and in their Opinion to a great Majority of Congress, that the Charges on all hands were much more the result of personal III will and resentment than of Calm dispassionate Observation and Enquiry. The Indiscrition of the Ministers and their Consequent Inutility were to your Delegates and many others perfectly Evident. They also thought that when Ministers of such high trust were accused of Such Enormities nothing less than a full and clear Investigation by putting the parties personally on their defence before their Country, and obtaining all possible light concerning their Transactions, ought to Satisfy the public. This was impossible unless the Ministers were present, and therefore your Delegates were of Opinion that they ought all to be recalled. Agreeably to this principle they Voted for the recal of Doctor Franklin,(8) but, they Confess, it was   with great reluctance. They had a high Opinion of his Merit and Services, and gave little or no Credit to the Charges against him- but they did not presume to think their Opinion of his Innocence to be Sufficient to Satisfy the public without a Trial. They are glad of this Opportunity of Explaining their Vote with respect to that able and faithful Minister, and venerable Patriot, and also to testify the pleasure they afterwards had when the Minister of France Informed Congress from the King that the appointing him Sole Plenipotentiary to his Court gave him the highest Satisfaction, and would engage his utmost Confidence.(9) But the Sentiments of your Delegates, and of many others in Congress were very different as to Doctor Lee. From his Letters, and from the concurring Testimony of many who were personally acquainted with him they Conceived him to labor under that Imperfection of Capacity which gives to trifles too much Importance, and to be of a temper So Suspicious and unconciliating as to embarass all public Business in which he might be engaged. They had also indubitable proof that he was not only denied the Confidence of the Court of Versails, but deeply suspected by them: and the Connection and participation of Councils and Sentiments, between that Court and the Court of Madrid were so well known to your Delegates that they Could not doubt of his Standing in the Same Predicament with both-and Consequently to be, not only, useless, but injurious at either. The proofs referred to are the following. In Debate on the Subject a Gentleman from Massachusetts Bay (Mr S. Adams) declared that he had it from the highest Authority, that Mr. Lee was not denied the full Confidence of the Court of Versails. One of your Delegates (Mr Burke) remarking this declaration, and observing that it was directly opposite to the Concurring representations of all who came from Europe, and to the general opinion as he was informed, of France and America he requested the Gentleman to name the authority he alluded to that other gentlemen might have an equal Opportunity of obtaing Such good Information which might prevent their giving their Votes to the prejudice of a gentleman who possibly might be a man of great worth, tho misrepresented through prejudice and popular Error. The Gentleman declined naming the Authority, and Mr Burke in Company with General Nelson a delegate from Virginia paid the Minister of France a Visit, in which the Conversation being introduced, the Minister delivered himself to the purport which is contained in a paper hereto annexed. Mr Burke reduced it to writing, and Comparing it with Mr Nelson both agreed that the Substance of the Conversation and almost the words were recited.(10) Other Delegates Impelled by the Same Motives made more direct application to the Minister and Mr Paca a Delegate from Maryland, and Mr Drayton a delegate from South Carolina, obtained from him an Extract of a letter from the Count de Vergens which Communi-  cated Certain dispositions, and transactions in European Courts to be Committed in Confidince to Congress, of which our own Minister were entirely Ignorant, and which in the Extract referred to accounts for that Ignorance by declaring that he feared Mr Lee and those about him. These several Testimonies were laid before Congress,(11) but to the great Surprise of your Delegates and many others the votes were, for recalling Mr Lee 4-against it four-and four divided. By this Division he still Continued Plenipotentiary to the Court of Madrid. Your Delegates are unable to account for this division on any other ground than that of a Secret Combination in his favor formed by his Brothers who had been Members of Congress for a long time preceding, but this, tho it obtruded itself on the observation and Conviction of your Delegates and many others in Congress, yet as it can only be the result of Conjecture, and from its Nature is incapable of direct proof it does not become your Delegates to Assert it as a fact, and therefore they only Suggest it as a Conjecture which forced itself on the Minds of many of the Delegates, and which obtained additional Force from many Circumstances that could not escape observation, particularly the following. It was observed that Several Gentlemen in debate threw out Suggestions that the House was divided into partizans of Mr Dean and Mr Lee, and that the Endeavour to recall the Latter was an attempt to Sacrafise him to the former. Your delegates heared those Suggestions with Indignation, and Considering all Individuals and their Interests as inconsiderable objects Compared to the public Service, and being firmly persuaded that Neither of those Gentlemen could any longer be useful, they wished to See both removed. A Motion was made by one of your Delegates (Mr Burke) for detaining the one and recalling The other for the purpose of Investigating more fully their allegations of Mr. Lee against Mr. Dean. This motion was lost by an equal division, the members voting against it who favored or made the foregoing Suggestions .(12) Upon the whole, your Delegates could find no Sufficient Cause proved for degrading any of the foreign Ministers tho they Saw plainly that none Except Doctor Franklin Could be any longer useful and even him they thought it right to recall in Order to give Satisfaction to the public by a trial, and that all of them, not excepting Doctr Lee, had some Merit, particularly unwearied attention and Industry. With respect to the State and disposition of foreign Courts Early last February the Minister of France in a private Audience informed Congress (13) by the special Command of his King That England had failed in her application to the Court of Russia for Succors-that peace had taken place between that and the Ottoman power under the mediation of his Master, that Austria and Prussia had also Submitted their differences to his Mediation, in which at his own request   he was Joined by Russia-That from all the Arrangements in Europe it appeared Certain that Britain could Obtain no alliance among the Northern powers nor had our Confederacy any thing to apprehend from thence. That the King of Spain had offerred his Mediation between Great Britain and France, declaring that if it should be refused or Evaded he would no longer Stand Neuter and See the Arms and power of France Injured and Insulted. That as a preliminary article the Indepen[den]ce of the united states of America must be Acknowledged. He in the name of his Master also recommended to the Congress to be prepared to take their place in a Negotiation for Peace which would probably take place, under such Mediation, and might be daily Expected, and to furnish their Ministers with an ultimatum, as moderate as possible; remembering always that the Events of War are uncertain, that peace is Exceedingly desireable as well to France as America-That nothing of Importance ought to be Committed to the former which could be obtained without, and That nothing ought to retard the latter which was not absolutely necessary to our Safety. That in the Cabinet of Britain there was as early as October '78 a great party in the favor of acknowledging our Independance, and that it was prevented only by the Hopes which the Commissioners gave of disunion amongst us, to excite and Continue which they had employed and rewarded Several Individuals in America. He also recommended Secrecy and dispatch that Spain might be properly informed of our resolutions and enable to press Britain to a decisive declaration in time to take part in the War and to Commence her Opperations with the then Ensuing Campaign. Also that as it was possible the Pride and Obstinacy of the British Monarch might still hinder the much wished for peace, we should be prepared to carry on the war against him with Successful Vigor, in order to which it was very adviseable to Come to a friendly understanding with Spain, and engaging her in alliance with us as well as with France, to obtain Effectual aid both of Force and Money from her, that in such Event we might obtain from her a Subsidy on very easy Terms which if prudently managed might restore the Credit of our Money-that the King his Master was prepared with all his force, which he would employ without reserve to force Britain into an acknowledgement of our Independence-That this was the only object which he proposed by the War, and when obtained he would chearfully lay down his Arms-But that he would assist with all his weight and lnfluence to obtain for us by Treaty any thing farther which we might require. In Considering this Important Communication the Congress were necessarily led to take a view of all the objects which were Interesting to the States Individually or Collectively-to Insist on what were Essentially Necessary to the latter was unanimously agreed to. But great difficulties arose Concerning Such as might be deemed pecu-  liarly important to Some, and remotely So to all. Almost every State could point out Such as were to her peculiarly Interesting, but the Importance of many of them to the whole depended on remote Contingencies, and the right to them was founded more on Casuistry, and Metaphisical reasoning, than on the received Laws and Customs of Nations. Your Delegates Considered that the State of America in general made Peace too desireable to be delayed for the discussion of Such rights, or for the obtaining of such objects, and very early fixed their resolution to observe a profound Silence with respect to all Such objects, and insist only on such as were Indispensably Necessary for the Safety of the whole. Thus to leave to the more vigorous growth of future ages to assert disputed claims while they would Secure to the present what might be necessary for fixing Deep the roots, and cherishing the National Strength to a prolific Maturity. Pursuant to this resolution they declined insisting on Some objects which were undoubtedly of great Importance to this and many of the Neighboring States, the delegates of Such States Concurring with them. The Delegates from Some very respectable States did not Seem Impressed with an equal Sense of the great Expediency of peace and insisted very Strenuously and pertinaciously on Making a Certain object (14) part of our ultimatum which was peculiarly Interesting to the States they represented, and which is far from being indifferent or unimportant to the whole. Some part of this object, (and in the Opinion of your Delegates Sufficient for the purposes of America for many ages if not forever) appeared to be involved in the general Rights of Sovereignty and Independance and So far every one was willing to Insist at all Events. But these claims Extended So far as to Interfere with the rights which must by the Law of Nations belong to britain after the war, and Such rights as Britain is always Jealous of in so a high a degree that She would make war at any time to prevent encroachments on them. The Delegates alluded to attempted to Support their claim to the Extended object on the right of Occupancy. (It appeared to your Delegates and to many others That Such Occupancy could not be an Occupancy of the united States, because their political Existance would not admit of it.)(15) Your Delegates and many others who could not perceive the Justice or force of their arguments Concluded that insisting on such an object would be, in Effect, refusing to make peace, and might even expose us to be deserted by our ally who might not think himself engaged to Continue in a State of Hostilities with a powerful Nation for such an object for his ally, and not chusing to risque the Continuance of the Calamities of War on the Success of reasonings which appeared to them futile, and which they were well persuaded would be wholly disregarded by Statesmen, they vigorously opposed the making of the object in the Extent required, an ultimatum. But being extremely desirous to gratify as far as they Could the States   who were peculiarly Interested, for whose People they have the highest respect, they Consented that it should be an ultimatum Provided our ally should be in Condition to Continue Hostilities for it in Conjunction with us. This passed the Congress by very general if not unanimous Consent but not being Satisfactory to the Delegates who contended for the object they moved to reconsider it and were Indulged. It was now the 24th of March, and every day for a Considerable time was expected to be the last which should delay this important Business. But tho' they and many others used their utmost Efforts to bring the affairs to a Conclusion yet it could not be Effected before the middle of August, (16) during all this time it was often postponed for Business which appeared to your delgates of far less importance, and they were Sometimes obliged to Concur for prudential reasons which the Sagacity of this Assembly makes unnecessary to mention. The Struggle was very arduous and pertinacious on both Sides, The one Considering a peace as inadmissable without an absolute acknowledgement of the right they claimed, and a Security for the undisturbed Exercise thereof, The other Considering the claim to all that Exceeded what was involved in the general right of Sovereignty and Independance as Extravagant and Insupportable, all, So involved, as Necessarily Secured by a Peace acknowledging that Sovereignty and Independance, and too well Convinced of the Expediency of Peace to Consent to its being delayed for objects of ambition or rapacity. The former availing themselves of all their Ingenuity and address to obtain resolutions of Congress, which, tho not apparently, might by [. . .] in Consequence prevent a peace until their favorite object Should be Secured, the latter firmly persuaded that the Sense of the great Body of the People through all the united States was with them, because Such must arise from their Interests and Circumstances that it was their Indispensable duty to prevent every obstruction to peace but such as were unavoidable, and that the direct operation of every resolution which should be passed on So important a Subject Should be plain and unequivocal were ever watchful to pervade every proposition, and by proposing Amendments, to Strip it of every Artificial Coloring until it was brought to the Simple Question \""Shall the War be Continued merely for that object?\"" As in this form it was impossible to obtain a Vote of Congress to the Affirmative, So when it was perceived that no Question Could be put but what must plainly come to this point those who Contended for making the object an ultimatum availed themselves of advantages which the rules of Debate and forms of proceeding in Congress gave them, and prevented the decision alltogether. Thus was much time wasted in Endeavouring to reconcile Opinions So Opposite on subjects of the highest Importance. At length it was rested on a resolve passed Early in the progress, that the object as far as it is supposed to be involved in the right of Independance Should  in no Event be given up, but no other Stipulations relative to it in a Treaty of peace were permitted to be a part of the ultimatum. Some resolutions were entered into for the better Securing the undisturbed Exercise of the right as above [limited?] in which your Delegates did not Concur, not being [convinced?] or that their powers Extended to the entering into Such Engagements as were proposed. (17) But it would be premature and Improper to mention the particulars of Such Engagements at present. Your Delegates hope it is Sufficient to inform the assembly that their dissent will appear on the Journal, and the State may avail herself thereof Should it hereafter be deemed Expedient. The Minister of France had a Second private Audience of Congress in July and then informed us of Some difficulties which prevented the Success of the Mediation of Spain which it required the Wisdom and Moderation of Congress to remove. The Congress resolved on the Measures which appeared to them the best for removing them, and if not too late, your Delegates have Strong hopes in their Success.(18) No Conclusive resolutions were entered into relative to the proposed alliance with Spain, while any of your Delegates who have now the honor of informing the assembly remained at Congress.(19) ""

Philadelphia Octor. 26th. 1779 I Shall for-bear, to attempt giving you a narration of proceedings in Congress further than to mention that I fear the large, nominal, Sums Calld. for, to defray the public expenditures, the ensuing year will be more than the people of New Hampshire will be able to pay, however as their Quota is one fifth less than heretofore, it may be a Temporary Easment to them. Sir you will perhaps Think it Strange when I asure you that if the States Should pay their Taxs. punctually at the Times perfixed, unless Something Can Speedily be done to reduce the prices of the Necessaries of life, regulate our finances, and retrench expences, The Treasury will Scarce be Supplied. The late Tragical Tumult in this City, was productive of Such Serious Consequences. The Committes have Since ceased their exertions to restrain the extortioner &c. whereby every article immediately doubled the price, which before was intolerable, to give you a Specimen, mens ordinary Shoes here are from 70 to 90 Dollars the pair, a yard of Cloth that formerly Cost from 13. to 15/0 Sterling per yd. is now from a 115 to £150 Currency per yd-and other things in proportion. How long, how long, Shall, or Can these things be Suffered or born with. These things, your prudence will forbid making Known, as the monopolizers & Speculators with you would avail himself of many advantages thereby. The last official News we have from Count D'Estaing is that he, with our Troops, had invested Savanah and were likely to be Successful &c-vid this days paper. The affair of Vermont is a matter of Serious Consideration for if I can Judge by present appearances, that District will finally be adjudged, either to N. Hampr. or N. York, and not to be a seperate Jurisdiction. It therefore becomes Necessary for the State of N. Hampr. to Exert every Nerve to prevent a State by her vast Extent of Territory, and Still Greater Claims, already Troublesome to her Neighbors and Tyranical to the last degree over all Such as are the unhappy victims OCTOBER 26, 1779  of their resentment-from Extending Jurisdiction as to Circumvolve the State of New Hampr. However I rest assured that the wisdom of the General Assembly is Equal to the importance of the undertaking, and it might Justly be Stiled Arrogance in me to pretend to point out a mode of procedure for them. My worthy friend Genl Whipple is able to give the fullest account of the most material Circumstances, and I have no doubt but his opinion will be attended to. I imagine there is a Copy of a proposed act (1) respecting the Grants Sent forward to Some Gent in the State which I am far from thinking will Suit a N.

8067,dg014137,1779,Nathaniel Scudder to John Stevens,"""Nathaniel Scudder to John Stevens   Dear Sir,(1) Philadelphia Octobr. 26th 1779 Being informed that you are again elected in Council, and presuming you will again preside therein, and consequently in all Probability be reelected to the Chair of the Joint Meeting, I presume to write to you on a Subject, which I know requires the greatest Delicacy, however my peculiar Circumstances and Feelings impel me to it; and I will freely rely on that Candor for which you are so distinquished, and that Friendship which I flatter myself you entertain for me, in the Use you shall make of this Letter; only requesting, that if any Person shall nominate me at the ensuing Election & persist in it, you will read such Part of it in joint Meeting, as you think will prevent my being at all balloted for-for, my Dear Sir, I think it would be equally hard on an old faithfull Servant to be balloted for, and, on Account of his particular Friends kindly withholding their Votes, loose the Election; or, after his earnest Sollicitations, to be excused from further public Service, to be elected and from the Peculiarity of his Circumstances compelled to decline the honor. I will only further entreat you to be assured, that this Address is not from a Presump- OCTOBER 26, 1779  tion that I should be again elected or even nominated; was it not for the partial & unmerited Attachment of some of my Friends; with whom I have conversed; more especially as I am daily more and more convinced of my great Unfitness in evey Respect (except in Point of Integrity and Application) for this arduous Task; and that there are many Men to be found in the State more equal to it. I now proceed to state my Circumstances freely to you, & I am not ashamed of them. I early entered into this Contest, firmly resolved never to retire from such Service as my Country should call me to, untill the Liberties of my Country (dearer to me than Fortune or Life) should be firmly established, or untill real Necessity should compel me to it. This Resolution was finally the only proponderating Circumstance in Favor of serving in Congress the last year, when I gave Way to the pressing Instances of many of the Members of our Legislature, and hardly was induced to Promise them that if I was again honored with the Delegation, I would devote as much of my Time to it as possible. This I have done, and beyond my Expectation shall be able nearly or quite to compleat my Quota of Attendance. This has added so much to the Reduction of the small remains of my private Fortune, to the Distresses & Uneasiness of my Family, to the Injury of my Childrens Education, that another Year's Attendance here would be ruinous. The following Declarations are made on the Veracity of an honest Man. First. I have during my public Service, for more than five years past, sunk much the greatest Part of my private Fortune, & do not repent it. 2dly. I have almost totally sacrificed a lucrative Business, by which and other Ways & Means I might have reputably made great Additions to it. 3dly. I have been under the Necessity ever since my Delegation to Congress and on Account of the Narrowness of my own Circumstances, to live in a Stile, in my own Opinion, really beneath the Dignity of a Representative of a free & independent State, and very very much below the Stile of the Delegates of most other States, having never been able to keep a Servant, and seldom a horse since I left Yorktown, and I believe the other Delegates of the State are in the same predicament.4thly. All the Wages I ever have received, or am to receive since my first Election into the Council of the State have little if any more than half paid for my Food & Raiment with other small contingent Charges, and I am ready at any Time to submit my Frugality and (Economy to the strictest Scrutiny. Indeed I must confess that I am much mortified when I reflect that the State has never to my knowlege given a public Dinner, nor have I myself in three Instances been able to invite half a Dozen of my most select Friends to a neat Family Dinner at my Lodgings notwithstanding innumerable Instances of Invitations from Members of Congress & other Gentlemen. I say not these things as the least Reflection on my Constituents, or under an Expectation of any further Compensation than my legal Wages for my past Services, but sincerely for the Benefit of the State, least that same Necessity,  OCTOBER 27, 1779  which now compels my Declination, may soon occasion other faithful Servants to retire from it's Service; when possibly their Places may be filled by ambitious designing Men or by others, who being Persons of like contracted Fortunes with myself may not perhaps so fully withstand those powerful lucrative Temptations, which here surround us, as I firmly boast I have done. I am sorry I have it not in my Power to copy this Letter; such as it is it must go, please to preserve it carefully till I see you. I am Dear Sir in greatest Haste, as Congress hour is arrived, but with great Respect & Esteem Your Friend & Hble Servant. Nath. Scudder ""

8085,dg014155,1779,James Lovell to John Adams,"""James Lovell to John Adams   Dear Sir Novr. 1st. [1779] Your Favor of Octr. 17th came this day to hand by the Post and contains such flattering Sentiments in regard to my subserving Your Mission as almost to intoxicate me into a Wish that I had not spurned much personal Honor and family Emoluments in pursuing a comparitively evident public Interest. But, nearly drunken as you have made me, depend upon it I am sober enough to distinguish between the Champaign with which my Regale began and the adulterated Cup which you hold out to me while you pledge yourself, in Case of future Correspondence, not to be in debt more than by the Difference in the intrinsic Value of the Letters will be unavoidable. Let me ask where you learnt such Language. It is not roman, it is not even french, and I am sure it is not such english as you were accustomed to NOVEMBER 1, 1779  talk before you travailed into strange Countries. Be that as it may, un peuegare, you recover your whole Self again shortly after, in the Affair of Mr. Iz.(1) I shall pursue yr. Injunctions. I sat about giving you some Idea of the Temper of Congress as to the Ultimata by extracting the Propositions & offered Amendments (2) but I found myself soon bewildered. You may by a little Conversation with our Friend SA (3) know more than a great deal of my Fatigue in the Way mentioned would convey. In short the great Difference sprung from our varying Quantum of Obsequiousness to the Dictations of a Foreigner as they were retailed to us through the mouths of either Fear or Roguery, and not from our being wide of each other in Opinion of our Rights, if we were in Condition to assert them or if our Ally would consent to join in a determined Assertion. But this said some must be quite on new Ground and not on the subsisting Treaties, for the whole End of these is the Assurance of our Independence formally or tacitly. And France to be sure would never think, at least would never insist that a common Right in the Fishery was included in our Independence in Matters of Commerce. For if this should be done, the Principle established would let in other nations which France & England would both chuse not to do. I am greatly pleased with the Confirmation by yr. travailed Experience to Sentiments springing from my own natural Temper-That the way to insure the lasting Regard of France is by showing independant Virility instead of colonial Effeminacy. Novr. 2d. The Bearer unexpectedly calls me to seal. I see my Correspondence with Portia is all over. She cannot write because I should see the mark of the Tear on the Paper. Heaven bless you both. J.L. [P.S.] I do not think it will be easy for me to send you the Vols. you wish by Way of Boston but if you can borrow a few Sets there I will be upon Honor to repay them as Oppy. serves and I will attend to chances from this River but I cannot promise 20 Setts.

Br. shod not be prevailed on either to cede or declare N Scota. independent the Priviledge of curing Fish on the Shores and in the Harbours of N Scotia be required.

8086,dg014156,1779,Nathaniel Peabody to William Whipple,"""Nathaniel Peabody to William Whipple   My Dear sir No. 5. Philadelphia 1st of Novr. 1779. I have the Honr. to acknowledge the receipt of your agreable favour of the 18th ulto. which Just came to hand per Post.(1) Tho your leaving Congress, was to me a very disagreable occurrence, and I exceedingly regret, being deprived of your Company, and assistance at this difficult and Critical Period, which, your Long Absence from home, and our Political Situation being so Circumstanced at that time, you Judged was a Necessary Event. Yet give me leave to assure you, the information of your Safe arival at Portsmouth has ministred no small degree of Solace to my mind, for I had been much Concerned lest the fatigues of the Journey, would have increased Some disorders you were Subject to. However as you give me no hint of that kind-expect the Tour might have the Contrary Effect-and hope you found Mrs. Whipple and all Connections in the most agreable Circumstances. In my letter No. 3 dated the 12th ulto.(2) I inclosed a Sketch, of proceedings on foreign affairs, Containg the most material Circumstances and facts relative to Some Congressional determinations upon the Great and fundamental Doctrines of Election & Reprobation, At the bar of which Tribunal it was Solemnly adjudged that no Patriotic efforts in the Cause of the Country, No Acts of Political or Relegious Virtue, Could be Esteemed Meritorious-When to the utter distruction and Reprobation of an honest man,(3) a faithful Servant, of the Public, One of the most perfidious of the Whole Tribe of Jesuits whose sole  NOVEMBER 1, 1779  views had been to divide the Councils of America, Bannish a Spirit of Republicanisim from her Sons, to introduce and Establish a General Aristocracy, or perhaps the domination of a British Tyrant, And who had wholly Joined himself to Idols, (and ought to have been let alone) was Elected to a most important office, Taken into the Bosom of the Beautiful, once Chast, Virgin, America there like a Vulture to prey, without Controul, upon her Vitals. These transactions, My friend, however orthodox they may be, are Malancolly Consideration. Thus Stood our foreign affairs till about the 21 of Octr. when it was resolved according to a previous order of the day to proceed to the Election of a Proper Person to Negociate a Loan with Holland &c. The Gentlemen in nomination were the Hone. H. L s and J. A s.(4) The Tall man from N.Y.(5) who, in Your hearing, has often offered to Sell his Vote, upon the Decission of important Matters, for a Pinch of Snuff, from first, to last in this affair, took every method to make the Appointment, and mode of Conducting it, so far as it could respect those Gentemen indellicate and disgustful-and I imagine with intent to Get rid of them both, by their refusing to accept any Public appointment, in order to make room for himself. Upon taking the Ballots they stood thus, viz N.H, M.B, R.I, NJ, P a, V , N.C, & S.C, were for Mr. L , and Ct, N.Y, & M.L. for Mr. A !! So Mr. H. L s was Elected agent to negoicate a Loan with the United Provinces in the Low Country &c for a Sum not exceeding 10 miln of Dollars, at a rate not to Exceed (6) per Cent per Anm. interest-Thus much for this time on that head. According to the order of the day Novr. 1st proceeded &c and Mr. H.L s was unanimously Elected Commissr. to negociate a Treaty of Amity and Commerce with the United Provinces in the Lower Countrys.6 After Long debates &c &c-yeas & nays &c. his Salary was fixed at 1,500 Stirling per anm. for Service & Expence-with liberty to appoint a Secretary with a Salary not to Exceed £300 Sterling per anm. I hope youll excuse these Pedling Sort of letters when I inform you that in order to keep up the Correspondance which is so agreable to me I am obliged to write in this way for want of intelligence that might be more agreable to you. The Most of the lies of the day are in the papers. Adieu my dear Sir, and believe me to be most Sincerely your friend and very Humble Servt, Nathl Peabody NB.

I hope the business will be Compleatly ended to the Southward in the first place. It is believed by some that the Enemy have Evacuated R Island; Appearances seem to indicate this; but no Authentic Accounts have as yet been recieved by Congress. I take the Liberty to inclose the last papers which Contain very little News; A Packet or two are hourly expected from Europe, which very probably may inform us of the Opperations in that Quarter of the World. It is feared, the Season is, or will be too far advanced, by the time the Count Compleats his Opperations to the Southward for him to proceed Northward; but he has Still Eight weeks before him. A Resolution of Congress passed Yesterday (1) will be transmitted to Your Excellency to be laid before Our General Assembly, to put a Stop to the further granting of Vacant Lands until the Conclusion of the war. The reason held forth for the adopting this measure, is the very great Emigration of people which will naturally follow the Measure, which I must acknowledge has some weight. But it is a well known fact that the Ostensible reason is, that the States at the end of the war, may Appropriate such vacant lands to the benefit of All the States in the union, to enable them to pay the Public debt. Virginia & No. Carolina Opposed this measure, and it is left to the wisdom of the Legislatures of the States similarly Circumstanced with Virginia, to agree, or not, with this Proposal. I have to request that Your Excellency will be pleased to send forward the Delegates to relieve us, it is impossible for you Sir, to conjecture how disagreeable it must be to the State to pay the extravagant expences we are at here; and how much more disagreeable it will be for us to require it. I have Called out of the Treasury more than the half of my Sallery & shall be obliged to Call for more to enable me to return to my family, where I hope I shall have the happiness to spend the remainder of my days in retirement; my time of life requires it. Genl. Washington is advancing by degrees towards New-York, to be ready to lend his aid to the Count D Estaing should he come thus far.

But we are sorry we are obliged to say that Congress were so determined to proceed upon this business agt the Rights of Virga. that on the next day, tho' the business of Indiana & Vandalia was an order of the Day, & we had no Doubts the Said Petitions wou'd be rejected-we discovered the Members for this business had changed their Ground & not only declined proceeding on the Resolution of the Committee, thereby meaning to retain that pretence for interferring in this Business-But were also pleased to pass the Resolution of the 30th a Copy of which is now subjoined to the other Proceedings.  NOVEMBER 4, 1779  Youll please observe that the ostenseable motives for this Resolution expressed in the preamble by the words much Mischiefs were understood to be the Clamours of Maryland & the discontented States of Jersey & Delaware-and the general Inconvenience of weakening the United States by encouraging Emigrations to parts remote from the defence agt. the common Enemy-the later assertion being thought improper for the public knowledge, was avoided & thought to be sufficiently expressed in the words before alluded to. We have been thus particular in the detail of this business, that your House being fully informed may consider this business on its true Principles without regard to the misconduct of Congress-and adopt such Resolutions thereupon as they may think consistant with the Interest of Virginia & the United States. We have the Honour to be, Sir, Yr. most obedt. & very huble Servts. C. Griffin Js. Mercer Wm. Fitzhugh (3) P.S. I beg the House to be informed that I was directed by the Comee. on my first Conference with them-to commit my objections to writing, & forbid to mention any thing of Charters or prior Treaties with Indians which Rule I adopted to prevent their having any pretence for going into the Merits of the Treaty of Fort Stanwix on which the Indiana Company founded their Claim.

8098,dg014168,1779,North Carolina Delegates to Richard Caswell,"""North Carolina Delegates to Richard Caswell   Sir Philadelphia Novr. 4th 1779 We have the honor of sending inclosed to your Excellency a copy of sundry Acts of Congress, in which we concieve the State over which you preside and that we have the honor to represent in Congress is both directly and indirectly interested; and on which we beg leave to make a few remarks. The principle on which the Indiana company found their Memorial is,(1) that the Territory which they claim is not within, nor subject to the Jurisdiction of either of the States; but to the whole United States in Congress Assembled. A principle which we humbly conceive, by no means admissable, it being against one of the principles of the general union. This controversy is not between two States; but between one State and individuals; therefore we are of opinion that Congress, more especially in an unconfederated state, has not jurisdiction and if Congress has no jurisdiction, consequently it was an improper subject for their deliberation, which was the foundation of the objection against committing it to a special Committee; nevertheless you may see that was overuled by a majority on the 14th of Septr. last. Two or three States objecting to balot for a Committee was the reason why that subject lay dormant until the 8th of Octr. at which time a Committee was appointed with an instruction to report first on the question respecting the jurisdiction of Congress; it being thought by some as a proper and necessary preliminary. You will please to observe how cautiously that matter was evaded in the  NOVEMBER 4, 1779  Committee's report, which brought on the question for recommittment in order that the Committee should pursue the direction of Congress. We need only refer you to the Journal of that day Viz the 29th of Octr. for the farther explanation of the report of the Committee. On the next day you may observe that to cut the matter short a sett of propositions were moved instead of the report, and were found to be in Order as appears by the Journal. On the whole it appears to us that there are great jealousies particularly respecting Virginia's extensive claim of Territory and generally of the other States under similar circumstances. We are induced to believe that with many the question respecting the justice or injustice of the claims of the Indiana and Vandalia companies is not so much in View as that of laying down some principle or pursuing such a line of conduct as may be most likely to obtain the main object, namely, that Congress shall have the disposal of all the unapropriated lands on the western frontiers of these States and that such lands may become the common property of the whole. We believe that at present the representatives of some States do not wish Maryland to confederate, hoping that by some means or other those States who Claim the back Lands may be prevailed on to surrender them. According to present appearances, Newhampshire, Massachusetts bay and Connecticut who formerly insisted strenuously on their claim to Lands Westerly, are indifferent about them. The Legislature of Maryland at their last Session advised their Constituents to give them explicit instructions on the subject of confederation, against the Session which is now setting. What effect that measure will produce is not yet known to us. These things we think our indespensible duty to communicate through your Excellency to the Legislature of Our State, as a subject worthy their serious attention; and we beg leave to reiterate our wishes that their Delegates in Congress may be seconded by being furnished with explicit instructions on that subject; as we apprehend it is very probable it may yet be a subject of serious debate in Congress. In the mean time we shall oppose to the utmost of our power every measure which appears calculated to injure our claim or violate the Charter in which our State has pointed out our Territorial Rights, and over which we have declared the right of our Citizens in Sovereignty. The good sense of our Legislature will give due weight to many reasons which they will concieve induced Congress to recommend it to Virginia to reconsider their late Act of Assembly for opening their Land Office. In our last (2) we inclosed a copy of the debit of Our State in the Auditor generals Office in which there was sundry errors. We have now the honor of inclosing another copy together with a Letter from Mr. Nourse to Mr. Sharpe explanatory of that matter.(3) NOVEMBER 5, 1779  We have the pleasure to congratulate Your Excellency on the evacuation of Rhode Island by the enemy on Monday the 25th Ulto. With the highest esteem & consideration, We have the honor to be, Your Excellencies Most Obt Humble Servants, Cornl. Harnett Wm. Sharpe P.S.

I hope never to have invincible arguments delivered to me by the Lips of consequential Sufferers to lead me to repent of having preferred the Public Good to my private Emolument on very singular Occasions. But strong Arguments I must expect to hear, for my own mind suggests them; and my Wants which prompt that Suggestion are trifling compared to what others connected in my private For- NOVEMBER 8, 1779  tune must experience. My Wants, too, may be easily removed by your Assistance, and that is secure on simple Demand. Know then, Sir, that it is totally impossible for me to keep myself decently clad by any purchases here without totally taking all my Income from my Family. Shoes are 85 Dollars, a Hat more that $200, Buff Breeches 200 and the making of every Thing boundless. I am not in absolute Want except of what the Girls call, Men's Small Cloaths & Stockings and Hatt. If Capt. Bradford or Messers. Otis & Henly have such Things and you will interest yourself to get them for me, I shall make a great saving in the difference of Exchange between Boston & this City of Sodom, by Procuring something of a Surplus in the Articles I may make a part turn out very Reasonable. For Instance in Knit Patterns or other Stuff for 3 pr. I may make 2 Cheap or get one for nothing. So in Hose 6 pr. would make 3 & 4 cheap. I have not ventured to say a Word of Linnen but have it I must and it would really be better to buy it in Boston than here even if dearer in the first cost, because my Wife or some of my former Schollars would save the making which here would be an Estate nominal. Mr. W. Greenleaf did me great Favor in the Shoe & Hose Way when I was there, it is not impossible that He may have good Opportunity now.

8114,dg014184,1779,Thomas McKean to John Adams,"""Thomas McKean to John Adams   My dear Sir, Philadelphia. Novemr. 8th. 1779. On my return from the circuit a few days ago I was honoured with your letter of the 20th Septemr. last, and proud to find that I was not forgotten by one I so much esteem. You must have had your difficulties in these times, I know, I too have had my full share of the anxieties, cares & troubles attending the present war. (1) For sometime I was obliged to act as President of the Delaware State and as Chief Justice of this; General Howe had just landed at the head of Elk River, when I undertook to discharge those two great trusts. The consequence was to be hunted like a fox by the enemy and envied by those who ought to have been my friends. I was obliged to remove my family five times in a few months, and at last fixed them in a little Log house on the banks of the Susquehanna above an hundred miles from this; but safety was not to be found there, for they were soon obliged to remove again, occasioned by the incursions of the Indians. In Decemr. 1777 I went again into Congress, where for some months the United States had but nine voices and thirteen members, sometime only Eleven, and their affairs almost desperate. When the war is over we shall talk of these matters more at large- Cur jubes me renovare dolorem.(2) Since the date of your letter I suppose you have been fully informed of what has passed in Congress respecting our foreign Ministers, and particularly yourself. You might have been Minister to Spain, which would have been a more permanent Appointment than that of Minister Plenepotentiary to negotiate a peace, but your friends had a greater regard to the interest of their Country than to your's; however I rest assured you will have peace (if to be obtained at all) on such terms, as will intitle you to the gratitude of that Country, and to secure such a proof of it as to render the present employment not only more honorable but more beneficial than the other. You have escaped the obliquy but not the jealousy of one of the parties in Congress, tho' the latter is almost done away. I have not been able to find that any of your Colleagues have censured you; they have been rather silent respecting you, tho' Doctor Arthur Lee considers you as an honest man and as his friend. In short he seems willing to submit his conduct abroad to your decision. Upon the whole I really think he has been not well treated either by Messrs. Franklin or Dean, or by Congress. His fate almost renders it dangerous to serve in a public character abroad. Do not my friend be discouraged by what I have said; difficulties, public and secret attacks, will eternally attend public Characters and high Stations. The man who discharges his Trust with fidelity & according to the best of his abilities will always have the consolation of his own mind (a consolation the world cannot give) and he may be  NOVEMBER 8, 1779  happy in the approbation of his country, but will never be miserable in the want of it-he will always also find a distinguishing, a worthy few, to support and applaud him. Doctor Franklin, I really believe, would have been recalled last April only for myself. The intention in some Gentlemen in Congress appeared to me to be the removal of all our foreign Ministers in order to make way for themselves. My fears were, that a change of men, at that critical period, would imply both in Europe and America a change of measures, and I was reluctant to give up old servants for new men, whom I could not so well confide in. Doctor Franklin still continues Minister Plenepotentiary at the court of Versailles, Colo. Laurens (the son of the late President of Congress) is appointed his Secretary. Mr. Jay is appointed Minister to the court of Madrid and Mr. Carmichael his Secretary. Mr. Laurens was appointed last Monday Commissioner to the United Provinces for the purpose of negotiating a treaty of Amity and Commerce, but particularly a Loan of money, and he has the nominating his own Secretary. Your's is the Post of danger and of honor; Our friend Mr. Dana is appointed your Secretary. Nothing more is yet done, but some Consuls must be appointed. You percieve the freedom with which I write to you. I correspond with none, except officially, but in this way, tho' I am induced to be more free with you, because, notwithstanding I hereby compliment myself, I am certain we have had the same views throughout this whole contest, the good of our country and the happiness of mankind; we have also acted openly and without guile. It will give me great pleasure to hear from you often, and when you are on t'other side of the Atlantic I will as frequently communicate what passes here.

8119,dg014189,1779,Cyrus Griffin to the Virginia House of Delegates,"""Cyrus Griffin to the Virginia House of Delegates   Sir, Novem. 9th. [1779.] I beg you will do me the honor to lay this letter before the house. I am at present alone in this important delegation; (1) perhaps abundantly more important than my Constituents suppose. A majority of states in Congress shew a manifest inclination to lessen the weight of Virginia in the general scale of the union; and the Continental Credit is already upon the very brink of ruin. At such a period the assembly are satisfied that my abilities and Influence are greatly inadequate to represent so vast a Country as Virginia, even upon the supposition I had the power of voting in Congress. I feel exceedingly for the rights of my Country, and the Welfare of America, and I hope to be excused when I express some degree of astonishment that at least three members are not sent forward to Philadelphia, and members too of the first abilities and character. After a great deal of heat and debate Congress have thought proper to pass a resolution relative to the Land office, which resolution and other proceedings were transmitted by the last post.(2) I am sorry to observe that so important a measure as that should have taken its origin from the Memorial of two private Companies claiming a large extent of Lands within the Bounds of Virginia to their own use and benefit, and offering a recompense to Congress of ten thousand pounds sterling for a confirmation thereof; and however as a member of the Virginia assembly I might be induced to make some compensation to the Indiana Claimants which they are very desirous to accept, and wish to acknowledge the Jurisdiction of Virginia and to defend the state against all opposition whatever, yet I think Congress have no business to interfere with such matters at the expence of our chartered rights, and the rights of an independant Legislature. When Virginia instructed her delegates in Congress to sign the declaration of Independency what did she mean by reserv- NOVEMBER 9, 1779  ing the sovereignty and internal Government of the state? No deception could be intended of any latent claim to extended Boundary; for Virginia ceded to Pennsylvania and Maryland and the two Carolinas all the Countries within their respective charters which might be supposed a part of her chartered territory and then adds \""the western and northern extent of Virginia shall in all respects stand as fixed by the Charter of King James the first in the year 1709 [1609], and the public Treaty of Peace between Great Britain and France in 1763.\"" Yesterday a letter was read in Congress from Colonel Brodhead with a late date at Pittsburg giving Information that some Inhabitants from the Counties of Yoghagania and Ohio had committed Trespasses upon the Lands of the Indians on the farther side of the Ohio River, which produced the enclosed Resolution.(3) With my affections to the assembly, I have the honor to be with great esteem &c.

The Period having long elapsed which the Count had assigned & the Engineers informg. that much more must be spent in regular approaches-and his longer  NOVEMBER 1 1, 1779  Stay being impossible, matters were reduced to the alternative of raising the Seige immediately or reducing the Garrison by Assault- the latter was agreed on and in the morning of the 9th the attack was made-it proved unsuccessful. We were repulsed with some Loss. Soon after the Count communicated his Intentions of raising the Seige, he could not be diverted from it as his Departure was become indispensible.

In our Service he has freely bled. I feel much for him-for while he is suffering the distresses of painful wounds, he has to combat the Torments of Chagrin.

We are extreamly sorry the expedition to Georgia (on which we had formed the most sanguine expectations of success) has ended so unfortunately.

It is unnecessary for us to inclose you Copies of the Acts of Congress on this subject, as they will be now forwarded to you by the President.

8140,dg014210,1779,William Churchill Houston to Caleb Camp,"""William Churchill Houston to Caleb Camp   Sir, Philada. 12 Novr. 1779. In my last (1) I was under a Misconception relative to the Embargo Law of the State of Pennsylvania. I find that by a transient attention to it, I accidentally mistook for an Act, a Bill printed in the Pennsylvania-Packet for publick Consideration, and which did not pass. The Embargo now in operation here is not conditional, but absolute as ours. It is my Duty to notice the mistake lest it should be instrumental in giving Impressions unfavourable and unjust. Every Day brings me fresh Uneasiness respecting the Supply of the general Treasury. The Expectation of Count D'Estaing's visiting our Coasts, in this Quarter, has created a Flood of Expense, and the Means of defraying it are narrowing fast. If the Taxes for the present year are not fully and punctually paid in, every Thing, but Hope, holds up discouraging Prospects. All the States must see the Necessity of Exertion, and I dare believe New-Jersey will not be behind the foremost. The Close of this Campaign is set down for the Era of Reformation in the Percentage-departments, to say no more, and es- pecially if we are so fortunate as to carry through a Limitation NOVEMBER 12, 1779  of Prices. Afterwards, it is to be confided, Expenditures will be much less. As to the Payment of the Taxes for 1780, I mentioned in my last that it was hardly to be imagined any monthly assessment or Collection could be made in our State, though if it were practicable it has it's advantages. It is rather to be supposed the Legislature will lay the Amount in two or three Payments, and collect the Taxes for Support of Government along with one or all of them. I have before mentioned the Case of two Payments. If three are preferred, being one Million twelve Thousand five Hundred Pounds each Payment, they come, at equal Intervals, the first of February, May and August. The Legislature may also probably consider whether Taxes are not more easily paid in the Spring than in the Summer, and lay more at that Season. There would also be another Advantage in this Policy, the Money will probably be more wanted at the Time these Taxes are calculated to begin, than towards the Middle or latter End of the Year. There is one clear and obvious Principle on which all Taxation ought to be rested, and if it could be laid as the Groundwork and extend through our Tax-laws, Payment would not only be practicable but light and easy; it is \""That every Man be called upon to pay in exact Proportion to his Ability, all Things considered.\"" The Practice of this Principle, I confess, can never be attained precisely, but it is a Point of Perfection to which Laws may be directed, and to which they may continually more and more verge. The nearer an Assessment approximates to this, the more just it is. Why is it not proper to estimate every Part of the whole aggregate Estate, be the Kind of Property what it may, according as it is of use and Emolument to the Owner or Possessour, and all Acquisitions currently arising from Advantages and Opportunities? This Maxim is practised upon in some of the States, and comprehended in the short Description of \""Taxing a Man according to his Faculty.\"" The whole Debt of the Union does not amount to one Hundred Dollars a head, and if set off on Scale of strict Justice, would not perhaps to the Poor be more than the Price of three or four Days Work on a Taxable. Our State, it would seem, has always been in the Custom of taxing Lands too deeply, and there are many Kinds of Property, and Sources of Wealth and Income which have never paid any Thing. I enclose for the Perusal of such as are curious, and have not seen it \""The Case of the Sloop Active,\""(2) which has produced a Dispute between Congress and the State of Pennsylvania. The Nature of this Case will be plainly collected from the printed Proceedings of the Court of Admiralty before which it was tried. I mention what further is necessary to give an adequate Idea of the Cause of Difference. In the Court of Admiralty the Jury gave one fourth to the Insurgents and three fourths to the Libellant and another Cruiser in Sight at the Time of the Capture. From the Decision, which is said to be   wholly on Matter of Fact, the Insurgents appealed. The Court of Appeals decreed the whole to them, and directed the Judge of Admiralty of the State of Pennsylvania to see their Sentence executed. The Judge refused, as the Law by which the Maritime Court is established in that State, allows an Appeal on Matter of Law only, and does not permit the Facts found by a Jury to be re-examined. Much Law-Ammunition has been spent on the Occasion, and the Difference is not yet adjusted. Certain it is that the Resolutions of Congress of 1775, on Admiralty jurisdiction, say, the Facts shall be established by a Jury. Lawyers say there is this Distinction between Trials by Jury and Trials by Witnesses, that in the former Case the Facts found are not re-examined, in the latter they are. Our Law for erecting a Court of Admiralty allows an Appeal in all Cases whatsoever, but it must be acknowledged that an Appeal on Matter of Fact from the Verdict of a Jury has not a good Sound. And yet Juries are too often worse qualified to decide in maritime Causes than any other. You have also a report of the Commissioners appointed by General Washington in April last, to settle a Cartel for the Exchange of Prisoners with the Commissioners of General Clinton. It has been already published in the News-papers.(3) It is with Pleasure I also send an Extract from the General Orders of the Commander in Chief of 29 July last. The Virtues of this aimiable Man as a Citizen are no less conspicuous, than his Spirit and Perseverance as a Soldier. Tomorrow will be published, by Order of Congress, the News from the Southward.(4) You will hear it with Concern. The raising of the Siege of Savanna is not so much to be regretted in itself, as the consequent Exposure of a large Extent of Country, the Inhabitants of which must unavoidably suffer before Succour can arrive to them. Let us however remember what has so often happened, that Confidence is the Road to Disappointment, and where our Prospects are least promising, from thence Success often comes.

8144,dg014214,1779,Henry Marchant to Nathanael Greene,"""Henry Marchant to Nathanael Greene   Dear Sir, Philadelphia Novr 12th. 1779 I recd. you Favour of the 2d Instant; and be assured that nothing could afford more Satisfaction than the open candid and confidential Sentiments you have expressed yourself in. They are such as I ever wished to live in the Enjoyment & free Communication of. I do indeed most heartily congratulate with you, Our Rhode Island Friends and Our Country in general upon the happy & important Event of the Evacuation of Newport & the Deliverance of the State NOVEMBER 12, 1779  of Rhode Island &c. I wish they were in no Danger of any future Invasion. What Effect the Disaster at Georgia will have upon the future movements of the Enemy I am at a Loss to conjecture. Yet I have great Consolation in this as in the Failure against Rhode Island, in a full Belief that it will eventually be for the best. Call it Accident, Fortune or what you will-I presume there will be found to have been the Wise Hand of divine Providence strikingly so-in these two Events. You will before this Reaches you have Major Clarkson, & Copies of the Dispatches which have been recd. from Genl. Lincoln. The Minister of France has had no Letters from Count De Staing. It is presumed he has sent Dispatches by Water. Col. Laurens I suppose is on his Passage by Water.(1) The length of Time since he must have sailed makes me doubtfull of his Safety. Our Attention is now drawn to the important Consideration of the necessary Steps for the Defense of South Carolina. I doubt not Genl. Washington's Thoughts are employed upon the same Object. In the mean Time, I hope the future Safety of Rhode Island will not be forgot, or entirely unassayed. I have had my Mind struck much in the same Manner as Yours has. I know a full Defence of that Town & Island must be attended with great Expence and much beyond the Abilities of that State to cope with. And how far The United States are at present competent to it I am unable to Judge-or how far the Importance of that Port to Us-& the Disadvantage it may be of to the Enemy should it be kept out of their Hand, may or ought, to induce a Continental Exertion is a Subject of great Importance, and which I could wish might be early discussed in the Cabinet and in the Councills of the Field with mutual Communications. Genl. Gates has now an Opportunity of forming his own Judgment & furnishing Materials for others to form theirs upon. I have one Wish, and that is that the most able Engineer might be sent there as soon as Possible to take a thorough View. For the present I would hope that a Defense agt. Ships, or a small Body of Land Force might be attempted. I believe from what I have seen done there, that might be effected with a little Expense comparative to the Importance of the Object to that State in particular, To the States in General-And to Our allies-whose largest Ships may there have a Safe & good Port. I hope the Contl. Force there may not be withdrawn without the most urgent Necessity. I have wrote the Governor (2) and some other Friends (3) my poor broken Sentiments upon This Subject and also upon a Line of Conduct That I believe ought to be adopted towards the Disaffected. I will venture one Thought to you upon that Subject. I know you will be able to make greater Improvements upon it than I can and to give greater Weight to Decisions that may be made in that State or Elsewhere. Those who have withstood every Act of Favour & Grace that have been tendered to Them thro' this Conflict, and have obsti-  nately persevered in their Attachments to the Common Enemy, whether by actually entering into Their Service-or by basely preferring their Protection and their Cause; will never be Our Friends whatever Appearances they may put on under pressing & necessitous circumstances. At least They will ever be ready to enter into Parties and Intrigues destructive of the Interest & Happiness of the United States. They will promote every Measure that shall tend to sow the Seed of Disunion amongst Us. They will-which is the Point I mostly aim at-when a Peace shall suceed to this War-Fall into a British Party, stir up Jealousies against the French, and distract the Minds of good People as much as possible. They will merge the Destination of Whig and Tory, into that of Gallican, and antigallican- and possibly in future Time raise their own Popularity upon the Ruin of the true honest Whig, whose gratitude will be lasting to the French Nation and whose Resentment Against Briton may not easily be assuaged. A line of prudence and Firmness ought to be adopted & if possible very similar throughout the States. A word more as to the present Intentions of the Enemy. It is thought most generally they will send a large Detachment to Carolina-may they not first attempt Virginia-and Maryland? While I was writing this, I was honored with yours of the 7th Instant by Coll Webb. I doubt not but Congress will early pay Attention to the Application which may be made. My Inclination will lead me in every Instance to gratify the wishes of brave and unfortunate Gentlemen when it may not be inconsistant with their greater Interest & the Honor and Safety of the States. My closest attention to the Subject when it comes on, I hope will lead me to a proper Determination as far as it respects myself, and I shall be happy that it may coincide with Your Wishes and the Feelings of those worthy & brave officers who conceive themselves so much interested in the Question. Should I find myself constrained to an opinion contradictory to those wishes I shall feel a sensible Reluctance in the Complyance with such a Duty. I am very sorry that any Dispositions made with respect to seperate Commands-or your appointment in the Staff should have deprived you of an Opportunity of doing Justice to your own Character in the Line. I was ever sorry you came into the Line-had I been present when it was done, as I have before told You, I should have opposed it. From what I knew of it, I was confident of the Difficulties in some Measure that would arise, I was doubtful whether in the Event it would be to your Interest, I knew however it would generally be conceived you had made an ample Fortune. I knew then there was not much of Character to be given-tho' much at Stake-and that You ran the Risk of sinking the Military Character into the Staff. My Friendship to You, & the Duty I owe the Publick will lead me-so far as may be in my Power-to assist in restoring you entirely again to  this Military Character. And to Such a Situation as you may be able to do Justice to Yourself and the greatest possible Good to your Country. But this I fear cannot speedily be done, at least not untill another year shall open upon us-And which I could wish may open with Peace, Liberty and Independence to these States. Our next authentick Intelligence from Europe may satisfy us upon this Subject. I am sorry Genl. Lincoln is not altogether so happy a Man, as you viewed him when you last Wrote. That Reflection in your Mind, I presume, as is natural, caused some of those Reflections as to your own Situation. May we not learn this Useful Lesson-That in whatever situation we are in, let us strive therewith to be content. Religion & true Philosophy teaches us so to be. I wish I could conform myself to it. Forgive this moral Digression, if so it may be thought. I expect Mr. Ellery Our very good Friend is now upon the Road for Congress to relieve me. I propose to set out by the 25th of this Month, and in Company with Mr. Wm. Redwood who goes to see how his Interests stand at Newport &c. If Head Quarters shall not be too far out of our Rout, I will endeavour to see you. However that may be, be assured I am yr. sincere Friend & humble Servt. Hy. Marchant P.S. You will excuse this Scrawl-I cannot submit to make a Copy of it. ""

By dispatches from Genl. Lincoln In Congress the Combined armies of America & France under Genl Lincoln & the Count de Estaing laid Seige to Savanna, Opened their batteries on the 5th of Octr. & Continued the Seige with little intermission untill the 8th of Octr. without bringing the Enimy to Surrender, and the time being elapsed which the Count had liberty to Stay, no alternative was left but to raise the Seige or attempt to Carry the Town by Storm-the latter was Concluded upon, the necessary preparations were made and in the morning of the 9th ulto. they attempted to Storm the place and were unfortunately repulsed with Considerable loss. Pre- NOVEMBER 12, 1779  cise returns are not transmitted but Genl Lincoln Says in his letter he had about 174 killed & wounded. Count de Estaing is wounded in two places, he behaved with great Spirit on the Occasion & appeared greatly Chagrined at the misfortune. Count Poulaski is killed & the loss of the French is said to be between three & four hundred killed & wounded. The French Troops have reimbarked on board their Ships & Genl Lincoln has retired to South Carolina & left the Enemy in possession of Georgia. The French army Consisted of three thousand, the troops under Genl Lincoln between one & two thousand. The Enemy, after Col Maitland Joined them, were about 3000 Strong. The Lord Reigneth, who will make us to know that the glory of our Salvation he will not divide with another. I beleive Such disappointments are necessary & that which now appears to be a Misfortune will prove the means of our final Safety. Your Excellency's letter respecting the monthly requisitions of the State of Connecticut has been laid before Congress & is Committed, (1) how Successful it will be am unable to determine, as almost every reason Suggested therein were urged by the Delegates in Congress against so large a Sum, at the time of making the requisition-however Shall do every thing in my power to have the Sum reduced. By Several letters recd. we were able to Satisfy Congress of our right to Set in Congress & now hold our Seats their althoug we have received no official Information.(2) Mr Sherman is returning home.

8146,dg014216,1779,William Sharpe to Richard Caswell,"""William Sharpe to Richard Caswell   Sir, Philadelphia Novr. 12th. 1779. Our great disappointment in Georgia is very disagreeable as well as the dangerous situation Charles Town is now in-the loss of which would sensibly be felt by No. Carolina particularly & all the states generally. The reasons why the former order; for the march of the North Carolina Brigade, was countermanded is so obvious to your Excellency that it needs no explanation.(1) To march Troops so far and with the necessary expedition must be extremely fatiguing, and yet I have no doubt that virtuous body of men will undertake and execute the orders with all the patience and fortitude of the Soldier. In case the Enemy send immediately a considerable reinforcement from New York to Prevost, the consequences may be very disagreeable. The Enemy at New York recieved despatches from their court, the 23d Ulto. the Contents of which has not yet transpired. Some suppose they have recieved orders to embark the greatest part of their Troops either to the West Indies or to Britain. It is true that there was a considerable appearance of an embarkation before they could have heard of the siege being raised in Georgia, a part of which is said to be homed for Halifax, particulars we have not heard. If wisdom was applicable to their Councils, we might have good reason to conclude they would repair immediately either to Europe or the West Indies and endeavour to hold something substantial and quit pursuing the shadow of conquering these States. A few days more will probably develope these things. I have the honor to send you inclosed an Extract of the Journal of Congress, a part of which will be sent officially by the President; I thought it best to give you a full view of what passed on that very interesting occasion, altho a degree of secrecy was judged necessary, and to which I take the liberty to add that three Continental Frigates will be immediately forwarded from Boston for the farther defence of Charles Town-If they arrive in time.(2) I have to give you the disagreeable news of the death of Mr. Hewes, whose remains was interred last evening.

Having so good an opportunity by Mr. Sheriff Johnston of Cumberland I now sit down to answer your favor of the 4th instant. Mr. Johnston will deliver you the printed Votes of the last Assembly, by which you will find that you have a right to draw for £4500 beside the former £1500, for the year ending the 3d Septemr. last: I believe the present Assembly will put the officers of Government on a more respectable footing than they have been since the Revolution. We must take Bail from the villains, who have uttered counterfeit emissions of our paper money since the 25th May 1778, but as the sum is discretionary, it ought to be very high. I have full proof that Thomas Bulla, whom we bailed at Lancaster, is deeply concerned, there being many charges against him. Mr. Laurens had engaged a Secretary before your Letters came to hand; a young Gentleman, who has lived with him these two years past, is now gone with him in that quality.(1) It would have given me great pleasure to have been able to have accomplished the wishes of your friend, but it was impracticable. Our disappointment in Georgia has somewhat deranged us, but Count D'Estaign's Efforts upon the whole have proved very beneficial; he was streightened in point of time, but before he was obliged to return to the West-Indies he agreed with General Lincoln to assault the Savannah on the 9th of October in the morning, which was done; but from a variety of untoward circumstances not uncommon on such occasions, we were repulsed, with a loss of 172 in killed, and wounded belonging to the American army; how many of the French we cannot learn, but Count Pulaski is killed and Count D'Estaign had two balls thro' him, that is flesh-wounds not dangerous. There are likely to be considerable changes in Congress, Governeur Morris & Francis Lewis Esquires are left out in New-York, your brother (2) and Mr. Wynkoop in our State, & some other Gentlemen in the other States. It seems the General Assemblies resent the treatment of Doctor Arthur Lee by Congress. Colo. Atlee tells me this was the cause in Pennsylvania.

What Services were performed by this Regt. during the Time I had the Honor to Command it, particularly on the fatal 27th of Augt. 76 You, Sir, as well as the House will find in the inclosed extract from my Journal.(3) Their Actions subsequent to the 16th of Novr. are more particularly within your own Knowledge. The three Pennsylvania Battalions were shortly after thrown into one Regiment, the Seeds of that dissipline they have in the Course of the war so often display'd, I flatter myself I had the Honor of planting. And was very happy in the Accounts given me by Col. Miles on his return to New York in January 1777 of my Countrys not having forgot me but that the Command wou'd be reserved for me, promising myself to have reaped at their Head, the Honors I flattered myself I was intitled to. A Regiment I am bold to say deservd as well the notice and consideration of those by whom they were appointed as any other in the Service. A Regiment by whose efforts in a great Degree was preserved our retreating Troops on the 27 of August. Least I should have been thought Vain I have hitherto suppressed any account of this days proceedings nor mentioned my many Dangers, losses, labours and sacrafisis of domestic Tranquillity in the service of my Country, a Recital of which I always viewed as a disagreeable Task, and inconsistent with the fine feelings of a Soldier. After my Release from Captivity-a long Captivity of 26 Months- No Vacancy then in the Army-I thought myself highly Honored by my Country when I cou'd not partake the Dangers of the Field, to be called to the Labours of the Civil Cabinet, in the great Councill of the Nation. Alas! How deceitfull are appearances. Instead of meeting, (as I flattered myself I meritted) the Applause of my Country, I have been cruelly disgraced and that in such a manner as adds insult to the injury, by the Grand Inquest of the State; without knowing my Crime or having publickly an opportunity of Vindicating my injured Honor.(4) I am now, Sir, to return to the Sweets of Domestic Life with a Consciousness of having to the utmost of my Abillities done my duty to my Country, whether in the Civil or the Military Line.(5)  I am Sir, with due Regard, Your most Obt., Hble Servt.

8158,dg014228,1779,Cyrus Griffin to the Virginia House Delegates,"""Cyrus Griffin to the Virginia House Delegates   Sir,(1) Philadelphia Novem. 16th [1779] On yesterday I had the honor to receive a resolution of the General assembly relative to the free navigation of the River Mississippi, the right of mooring vessels to the shores of the said River, the free navigation of the Gulph of Florida, a free port or ports in the Island of New-orleans, and the privilege of a consul to reside there.(2) In answer I am bound to let my Constituents understand that the honorable John Jay Esq. our Minister Plenipotentiary to the Court of Spain has already Sailed for that Country with positive Instructions in what manner this important business is to be conducted.(3) A part of the ultimatum stands thus-\""That if his Catholic Majesty shall accede to the said Treaties and in concurrence with France and the united states of America continue the present war with Great Britain for the purpose expressed in the Treaties aforesaid: he shall not thereby be precluded from securing to himself the Floridas; on the contrary if he shall obtain the Floridas from Great Britain these united states will guaranty the same to his Catholic Majesty; provided always that the united states shall enjoy the free navigation of the River Mississippi into and from the Sea.\"" Thus much for this part of the ultimatum, and most certainly it ought not to be generally known. \""You must endeavor to obtain some convenient port or ports below the 31st Degree of south latitude on the said River free for all Merchant vessels, goods, wares and merchandise belonging to the Inhabitants of these states, also a loan of five million sterling, and an subsidy in consideration of the guaranty aforsaid.\"" But if the assembly are of opinion something is still wanting for the welfare and safety of these states, in that case the other propositions can be made to Congress by way of additional Instructions to the said Minister, tho to my Judgment in our present circumstances and the absolute necessity of a foreign loan, there can be little proba[bi]lity of succeeding in such propositions.

NOVEMBER 16, 1779  The Principles of Equality in the Treaty between France and us being held up as a Model for future Treaties may betray negotiators into an Error; because tho' the Equality in regard to France & America is conspicuous, yet Partiality to France compared with other Powers has been established; particularly in the XIX Art. of our incorrect copy. \""On the contrary no Shelter or Refuge\"" &ca.(1) In the XIII article, same Copy, French and Americans shall enjoy reciprocal Rights in the respective Dominions.(2) The banished Americans cannot be allowed this under the Title of the Subjects of the King of Gr. Br. The respective States of our Union who have passed Laws in their sovereign, independent Capacity, will not consent to repeal them, for the Sake of readmitting into their Bosoms capital Villainy. This was hinted yesterday by 5th. Carolina and will produce an Instruction if you or we find it necessary. If I do not accomplish to send you by Palfrey or Foster the Orders & Credit you mentioned in yr. last I will most assuredly see that you shall not be without them. There is no trusting to Expedition in the Remittances of Funds by our Committees, nor indeed to Expeditiousness of any Kind here though we are reduced to a few now- the Gen'men for the most part taking themselves home to warm Lodgings, while the Drudges alas must sleep but few hours under slight Coverings & Alone.

8160,dg014230,1779,Henry Marchant to William Greene,"""Henry Marchant to William Greene   Sir, Philadelphia Novr. 16th. 1779 In my last (1) I enclosed Your Excellency a Resolution of Congress granting a Warrant in Favour of the State of Rhode-Island upon the Genl. Treasurer thereof for three hundred thousand Dollars, to be paid out of their Quota of Taxes. I now enclose your Excely. the Warrant. In a late appointment of Commissioners for the Chambers of Accounts I nominated Mr. N. Mumford and he was elected of which I have given him Notice.(2) How far it may be to his Interest I know not, or whether he may be more Serviceable within the State, or in this Appointment I am uncertain. I could wish that whenever  NOVEMBER 16, 1779  Our publick Accounts come to be settled there may be some Person near to explain any Difficulties that may arise. He will not, and by no means ought he to, be one of the Commrs. to settle & adjust them, as he audited them for the State by order of the Genl. Assembly; but, being present he may give much Light to those to whom the Accounts may be submitted for Settlement. However I had the publick Good in View in the Recommendation, as I looked upon him a complete Accomptant. At the same Time I conceived it would not be disagreable to the State, If they can dispense with his Service where he is. I was yesterday honored with yr. Excely's Letter of the 5th Instant;(3) and for the several Articles of Information therein I am much obliged. As to Capt. Tyler's Affair, I wrote Your Excellency before,(4) it was committed. No Report is yet made-And I am well persuaded that nothing will be reported in the least to the Discredit of the Doings of the Genl. Assembly. Too much Caution however I think cannot be used upon every great political Question. I have nothing to communicate of News but what may be in the enclosed publick Print-But I have still to assure your Excely. that I am Yours & the States most obedient & Very humble Servt. Hy.

No Circumstance Could interupt the Satisfaction I feel upon this, and every like, occasion, Equal to a Consideration of the Trouble it has given to a paternal friend, I have So much reason to Esteem. I am much obliged by the Several Communications in your letter- But have nothing worth notice to give in return, except what is Contained in the papers herewith inclosed where you will find the disagreable News from Georgia except a few Circumstances attending the Seige & assault of Savannah Not worth Publishing. Altho this Southern Campaign has gained us Considerable advantages, by Causing the Enemy to Evacuate Some of their important Posts, leave others in a Defenseless Situation, And in many instances diverted their Attention from the pursuit of Objects, that would have distressed many of our fellow Citizens-And the Loss we Sustained, all things Considered, is not Great, Yet the disappointment has materially Deranged our Plans for future military Operations. I wish to make Some observations respecting my Situation but must omit them  NOVEMBER 16, 1779  for the Present, as I hope Soon to be releived by Some person Comming on to take my Place agreable to the request in my letter to you by last Post. Mr. Langdon Sets off for home in two or three days,(1) And Nothing Could induce me to Tarry longer, but the disagreable Prospect of leaving the State unrepresented, at a time So Critical & important as the present day, when it woud be difficult if not impossible to make Congress to Transact business, if another State Should be left unrepresented.

8164,dg014234,1779,Nathaniel Scudder to Richard Henry Lee,"""Nathaniel Scudder to Richard Henry Lee   Dear Sir, Philadelphia Novr. 16th. 1779. Our Life is a strange Kind of checquered Work, one Day we rejoice, on another we lament; in one Letter we congratulate, in the NOVEMBER 16, 1779  succeeding one we condole. Alas! for the southern Disappointment! Indeed the same Day often exhibits a Medley of Mourning and Festivity, of Joy & Lamentation; witness the 11th instant, the Day after we received the melancholly Confirmation of the Repulse of the allied Armies at Savannah. On that Day the President of this State was elected and proclaimed, and on that Day the Funeral of our Friend & fellow laborer Mr. Hewes of North Carolina was attended with the usual mournfull Formalities. About 12 o'Clock the President of the State, Mr. Reed, was proclaimed from the Court House Steps, and a Feu de Joy fired on the Occasion; after which there was a Procession to & Collation at the City Tavern, the Bells chyming joyously &c. &c. About 4 o'Clock the funeral Procession of the Honble Mr. Hewes began, the Same Bells ringing muffled; and as we proceeded down Market-Street we had a fine View of the continental Colours displayed on Market Street Wharf in Honor to the President. When we arrived at Christ's Church we were entertained with the usual Service, and a very solemn funeral Anthem, after which the Body was interred. Scarce had the Attendants reached their Homes, before the Bells again unmuffled resumed their festive Sounds, with firings as usual, and the Evening closed with a grand Serenade at the governor's Door. Sic eminet; S sic transit gloria Mundi. I observe by the last Boston Paper that Mr. Samuel Stockton, who has for a considerable Time acted as Secretary to Mr. William Lee in various parts of Europe,(1) is arrived in that City from Amsterdam; I daily expect him here, and hope for much usefull Information from him, as from our former Intimacy I expect to find him unreservedly communicative. I doubt not he will be very able to unravle some of our foreign Mysteries. Congress is at present very thin, rarely more than 10 States represented, often but 9. Many important Businesses on Progress much as usual. What can the Neglect of your State be attributed to? Only one Member here for many Weeks.(2) Mr. Duane is again in the Delegation from New York-Goverr. Morris left out. Mr. Floyd in again, Mr. Lewis out-General Schuyler, Mr. Scot, Mr. Livingston & a Mr. Lommedeau added. Our old worthy Friend Mr. Sherman left out by Connecticut, this I think not a little ominous, as he is one of the Originals. In short, what with the Effect of Manoeuvre on the one hand, and of Necessity on the other, I fear, entre nous, both that State and New Jersey will next year appear in different Colours from what they have heretofore done. As for myself, sheer Necessity compels me to retire, and I have therefore so ordered it with my Friends as that I expect not even to be balloted for. My Time expires on the first of December, so that I shall be here only one Week after this.(3) I wish I may be happy enough to hear from you before I leave Philadelphia. To morrow at 12 o'Clock is fixed for the public Audience of the New Minister of France. There will be a public Dinner.  NOVEMBER 17, 1779  The Enemy received the first Account of our Defeat in Georgia from Philadelphia. They had a great Feu de Joy on Saturday last. We can learn Nothing of their intended Movements, tho' there is undoubtedly a capital Embarkation on Foot; I fear for Savannah, Charles Town or your Neighbourhood. I wish soon to hear you are returned to Congress. Make my most respectfull Compliments acceptable to your Lady and believe me to be with great Affection & Sincerity, your Friend & very Hble Servt. Nath. Scudder P.S. I am this Morning told Mr. Deane is going to Virginia to take his passage on Board a 50 gun Ship belonging to Beaumarchais now in your Bay.

The Legislature, we flatter ourselves, will be disposed to overlook any Defects in the Plan recommended by Congress compared with the Scope and Tenour of their representation, when they reflect that different States as well as Individuals, however they may coincide in the main Substance of a Measure, vary often in their Ideas on particular Parts, and also when they are informed that what we have now the Pleasure to transmit has passed with a great Degree of Unanimity. For the Sake of this and greater Expedition, Policy dictated to concede a little. From Appearances we think ourselves justified to say that the measure recommended will, in all probability, be universally adopted throughout the Union. The Date of Commencement is more distant than could have been wished, but when the remoteness of some of the States is considered, as also that many of the Legislatures are not sitting, and that the Limitations ought to take Place at the same Time every where, it could not well be gainsayed. Other Arguments also have been urged tending to shew that this will give fuller Efficacy to the Measure by giving People, an Opportunity to provide against Losses and Disappointments to their essential Prejudice. The ratio of the Prices to those current formerly, though by many thought too large, is set at a Limit which we hope will produce an easy Turn to the Tide of Depreciation, and make a further reduction in due Time more natural and practicable.

Congress is doing every Thing possible for the Assistance of the southern States, and we hope to be able to embark the North-Carolina Brigade, and any other Troops General Washington can spare on Board Count De Gras's Squadron in Chesapeak, which if effected will afford a speedy Reinforcement to your City, and save immense Expence and fatigue. I rejoice to hear some french Frigates are [yet] at Charles Town for it's present Defence; and I am of Opinion the Embarkation from New York will not take Place while the french Line-of-Battle Ships continue hovering on our Coast. We have indeed some Accounts from thence which say they have debarked a great Number of Troops, which they had put on Board. I am now, my Dear Friend, retiring to a private Life, this being my last Week in Congress;(2) but believe me I have no Idea of shrinking from any further Share in this important Contest-No Sir-I will continue to exert myself on all Occasions for the public Good, both by a spirited Opposition to all peculators & public Defaulters, and, if necessary, by again taking up the Sword, and even in the Ranks with those (over whom I lately held a high Command) exposing my Life, which with my Honor are almost all I have left to expose out of that List of Valueables, which when I early signed the General Association I solemnly devoted to the good of my injured Country. I know you pity me for the unequal Sacrifices I have made-I thank you for it. But I know that I have done nothing more than every honest man ought to have done; and I appeal to Heaven [. . .]nk Necessity alone which compels me [. . . ac]cept public Station. Congress has at Length adopted a set of Resolves whereby they recommend to the States a   general Limitation of Prices, so that no Labor or Country Produce shall exceed 20 Prices of the Year 1774. What the Effect will be Time only can demonstrate. We were yesterday, and shall be this Day [laying] a Plan for drawing upon yourself and Mr. Jay for 100,000 Sterling at 6 months sight-whether we venture a Leap in the Dark I know not; I rather [think] we shall-how would you like to meet with a Number of these Bills on your Arrival at Amsterdam. Desperate Diseases require desperate Rimedies. Mr. John Adams & Mr. Francis Dana accept the Appointment & will sail in a few Days. I thank you for your kind Expressions in Favor of myself and Family, and were it not that I fear to offend your generous Delicacy, I would in the most emphatical Language paint my Gratitude to you for that unmerited Attention you have paid me in Person and for the numerous Favors you have conferrd upon me and my Son-but I will not give you Par[ticulars.] I only wish to continue to share the Honor of [your] Friendship, and that my Son,(3) whom you have been [...] so kindly to patronise, may render himself worthy of your goodness and future Attention. He and [his] Sister join in presenting you their most respectfull Complements, and in wishing you a safe & prosperous Voyage. You have my most ardent Prayers for this and every other Success and Blessing [tempora]l & spiritual to which your most sanguine W[. . . as]pire. I shall esteem it a peculiar happiness to hear from you immediately after your safe Arrival in Europe, and as often afterwards as your important Business there will permit. I shall hold my Son attendant on your Commands at least untill the Beginning of the Summer; [In the] mean Time shall urge him to make every Improvement in his Power. If it be agreable to you, you will please to place your Letters to me under cover to the President of Congress, who can conveniently hand them to my Son-mine to you will come through the same Conveyance. And now, my Dear Sir, permit me to repeat my anxious Wishes for your future Wellfare, and to subscribe myself with the highest Regard, Your sincerely affectionate Friend, & most obliged Humble Servant, Nathl Scudder [P.S.

I do myself the honor to inclose two Acts of Congress which the assembly may perhaps consider as containing matters of some importance . The demands for money upon the Continental Treasury are great indeed. The different States must supply those demands, or the period will shortly arrive when the whole Continent may totter to its foundation, at least I fear a general stagnation must be the consequence. A Captain this moment from the West Indies confirms the account of a Boston paper, that a bloody engagement has taken place between the Combined Fleets and that of great Britain; the latter were severely beaten from superiority of numbers; two considerable ships destroyed, and three of the largest taken. The French lost one of their best which went to the bottom during the heat of Battle. From circumstances We give some credit to this account; and particulary as it does not come from the Southward. It is well ascertained that the great object of the Enemy in the present stage of the Contest is to get possession of Charles Town, and of consequence to secure the two southern states. To my Judgement the assembly ought to give the utmost assistance to prevent so great a misfortune even to the common Cause; but in particular as most assuredly the subsequent movements of the Enemy would tend to the state of Virginia-for the purpose of commanding the Chesapeak. I have the honor to be, with great respect, Sir, Your most obedient and humble servant. C. Griffin ""

The Question relative to the Crown-lands which you mention,(2) is never out of Sight; and I am more and more convinced must, for the Peace of the Union, be settled upon some different Principles. I am as fully convinced of the Weakness of the Claims as before I came to Congress, and not less doubtful whether they will ever tend even to the pecuniary Interest of those who set them up. Certain I am they will never promote, but will probably ruin their political Interest. It is not however the less just that we should have our Share of the Proceeds of those Lands; and here arises a Question which I recommend to your Consideration. Whether had we better contend for this on United or Confederated Grounds. [Mary]land says, as we are; others are of a different Opinion. I would be happy to hear your Sentiments on so interesting a Question, as I am far from being clear that the Charters of some States, or any Muniments by which they can justify a Claim, extend as has been too credulously supposed. It gives me much Pleasure to hear of the Success of the Loan in your County, and am persuaded if Gentlemen of Influence would equally exert themselves in other Places the Effect would be the NOVEMBER 27, 1779  same. But many rather set idle and wish that Things may go right, than put their Exertions to work to forward them. The Progress of Loans for a while in the present Exigency, is a desirable Object, but this pressing Crisis over, they had better be discontinued in future as being a disadvantageous way of raising Money. You speak of the Eligibility of foreign Loans to a moderate Amount; and I am fortunate to find you agree with my Ideas on this Matter. You know already, or will ere long that this is not a Subject dormant or untouched. But you hold with me I trust that it would not be best to go so far as to make one Tittle of Exertion at Home, and in our own Power, unnecessary. A domestick is preferable before a foreign Debt, unless the latter is contracted at considerable Advantage above the former. The Idea of interesting European Powers in our Favour, is worthy of the Attention of Statsemen. I hear little from my Friends at Mount Holly but am contented to be neglected, if the high Concerns of the State engross their whole Attention. Can you steal Half an Hour to inform me what is done and doing? The Army, the General writes us, is moving to Quarters, principally in New-Jersey. I hope this will be some Relief to our Militia. No News of much Importance, but a Report from the West-Indies that the English Fleet are worsted in the Channel. We wait for a Confirmation, as it has no Mark of Authenticity yet. If you spare Time to look into this [tent?] of Hurry, Squabbling and Noise, beg you will not pass by. Your sincere Friend and hble Servant, William Ch Houston ""

8212,dg014282,1779,Robert R Livingston to George Clinton,"""Robert R. Livingston to George Clinton   Dear Sir, Philadelphia 30th Nov'r 1779. I did myself the honor to write to you last week,(1) but missing the post you will receive that letter by, this conveyance, since which nothing material has hapned here, except that I find a violent inclination in most of the States to appropriate all the western Lands to the use of the United States, & in proportion, as they feel the weight of taxes, that inclination will increase, till I fear it will at last overpower us, unless we contrive to make a sacrafice of part to secure the remainder. This I think we may do to advantage now, while they treat our title with some respect. I would, therefore, submit it to your Excellency whether it would not be prudent for our Legislature to empower us to agree to make a north line, extended from the northwest corner of Pensilvania to the lake Ontario our western boundary, & from thence along the northwest shore of lake Ontario & the river St. Lawrence to the bounds of Canada, & from thence along those boundaries to the State of New Hampshire. This will secure Niagara to us, and the navigation of Lake Ontario. It will put our claim out of dispute, enable Congress & us to apply our Lands to counter secure our money. In every view this matter appears important to me. I wish our Legislature may see it in the same light.(2)We have already had one attack which we very fortunately warded, tho Virginia is unrepresented. The attempt convinces me of the risk we run by being too insatiable in our demands.(3)  NOVEMBER 30. 1779  We have not a word of foreign news except vague reports from the West Indies of a battle in the Channel, but nothing that can be depended upon. You may believe that we are very impatient for the Issue of so important a conflict. I am sorry to tell you that money has fallen below any thing that you can suppose. I need give you no other proof of it than by telling you that I this day paid £537 this money for a plain suit of cloaths, £21 for plain buttons to a servant's coat & putting them on, & 26 dollars for sawing a cord of wood; grain & country produce have even risen beyond foreign articles.(4) But still I do not despair of retrieving it if my plan sh'd be adopted & be well seconded by the Legislatures.

Reprinted from Clinton, Papers (Hastings), 5:382 83. 1 Not found. 2 In his January 7,1780, letter to Livingston, Governor Clinton responded: \""I agree with you, that it may be to our interest to give up a part of our western lands; if by this we may be able to enjoy the Remainder free from every claim. On this condition I would for my own Part be contented with the Boundary described in your letter.\"" Clinton, Papers (Hastings), 5:445-46.

Livingston of New York, 1746-1813 (New York: Harcourt, Brace & Co., 1960), pp. 118-19. 3 See John Jay to Clinton, October 7, 1779. 4 Livingston's accounts for his service as a delegate contain additional evidence of the impact of inflation during 1779-80. In claiming pay \""from the 19 November 1779 to the 27 September 1780 [less 20 'Absent days'],\"" Livingston listed the specie value of the dollars he had received at the Continental Treasury from January to September 1780, and for these transactions he recorded exchange rates of 40 for 1, 60 for I, 72 for 1, and 75 for I successively.

You inform me that the House have voted a tax of 5,800,000. I feel for many honest people on whom this Tax must fall very heavy; but I as sensibly feel the necessity of the punctual payment of the money. You mention a Commee to Settle with the Army. I am at a Loss what kind of Settlement you mean, & should be pleasd to be informed. Congress have increasd. the subsistance of a Colo. to 500 Dollars per Month & others in proportion;(2) this mode of relieving them was preferred to increasing their pay, as half pay for 7 years had been previously granted. A Petition of the Genl Officers NOVEMBER 30, 1779  [is] now before Congress which will soon be acted upon.

I am very sorry that the Business to which you refer has not been acted upon before this DECEMBER 1, 1779  time, as a state of suspense is very disagreeable & perhaps injurious, there are two Reasons which have occasioned the Delay, the one is the variety of publick Matters which in our present fluctuating State arrests the Attention of Congress; the other is, the Oppinion of Some Gentlemen in Congress that the Department is an unnecessary Expence, and that the Business would be done as well by the Inspectors of the Army. This oppinion has prevailed with the Commee. on your memorial who have made a Report accordingly. I am not well enough acquainted with the Numbers or the Duty of the Inspectors to determine whither the Business can be done to Advantage by them, or what is the Number or Expence of the Officers under you. I wish you would inform me of these Facts as the Report may lay for sometime.(2) I Am convincd. of your Integrity and Patriotism & am sure that you would not wish that the Publick should incure an Expence without receiving a Solid Advantage even if you were the Gainer. The Sentiments containd in your Letter relative to other matters I read with Pleasure but have not Leisure just now to Answer. I am Sr. with great Esteem your most obedt. Humbl Servt, Geo. Partridge P.S. The oppinion of Gentlemen to discontinue the Department of Musters does not in the least arise from want of confidence in the Integrity and Ability of the Officers on the Contrary I think of no Department in the Army, except yours, against which I have not heard many Complaints. N.B. You are not [to] determine from what I have said of the Report of a Commee that a new arrangment will take place, that is very uncertain. GP ""

They have been gone 10 Days and very unlickely for me about that time, Dr Weatherspoon and Dr Scudder, left Congress and I cannot leave Mr. Houston without leaving the State unrepresented.

This moment Congress have determin'd to leave Philadelphia (past 1 oClock) now debating about the time, next will be the Place. I do not imagine the Debates will be finishd this Day.

Lincoln.(1) Their number is about seven hundred rank & file. It is not altogether certain whether they will go by land or water, I rather think, the former. Genl. Washington holds the Virginia Troops in readiness to march there also; yesterday Congress sent advice for them to move on immediately.(2) Their number cannot be reckoned at more than 13 or 1400 as a large number of that line will have served out their time for which they were enlisted, in March next. Three or four weeks ago the enemy at New York had embarked 8000 Troops, but were countermanded, supposed to be in consequence of Count de Grass being in or near Chessepeak. Genl. Washington is of opinion that they are preparing to embark again; but cannot learn their distination. They have lately received dispatches from their Count, the contents of which has not transpired. We have repeated accounts of an engagement in the English Channel on the 4th of Septr., and that the combined Fleet was victorious; but not authenticated agreeable to our wishes. Our Army is busy Cantoning-one Divission on the east side Hudsons river-the Cavalry near Danbury in the border of Connecticut-the main body near the Scots plains on this side the river. It is supposed head quarters will be at Morris Town. It would be improper to mention to you on paper the number of Our Army-much might be said of their Virtue, good order & discipline. The collected force of the enemy in New York & it's vicinity is supposed to be upward of sixteen thousand. If they were enterprizing the consequences might be serious. Our Treasury is nearly exhausted-we have great dependance on the several States for its restoration. We are about to negociate, to the amount of £200,000 stirling in Bills of exchange on our Minister at Madrid & our Commissioner who is gone to Holland, from which we hope for some relief.

It is therefore humbly Submitted that It Should be proposed to their most Christian & Catholic Majestys Ambassadors, Agents, Governors or Commanders, that a fleet In Such force of both or either of said powers as would in all probability Insure a Superiority on the Coasts South of South Carolina over any british naval force which may reasonably be Expected In that Quarter, should be sent as Early as possible to Charles Town together with five thousand land forces to Operate In Conjuction with what American force may be In that quarter against the British in Georgia, that after having reduced or expelled the Enemy from that State, the Combined force should proceed to the reduction of the british Garrisons In East or West Florida as should be deemed most Expedient by the Contracting parties, And that having Accomplished this or faild In the operations the American troops Should be reconvoyed to Such of the united States as may be agreed upon Your Committee beg leave to Observe on that part of the paper delivered by Don Juan de Miralles which regards a Supply of provisions for the Inhabitants of the City of Havanna and Isle of Cuba, That It would be Improper to Make a pointed promise to furnish Such Supply In part or the whole until It is put beyond all doubt, that there will be a Surplus after the Army and Navy of the united States, and the fleet of our Ally are amply provided, That nevertheless, as an Inducement to procure a Spanish force to Cooperate with our troops In Georgia, If they cannot do It without an aid in point of provision, some risk Should be run and a dependance put on Extraordinary exertions to procure provisions In this Quarter for our own Army.

After much altercation I have at last, prevailed on Congress to consent to the Virginia troops proceeding to join you. The great impediment that has hitherto been in the way, was the long & difficult march & the hopes of procuring the aid of the French fleet as a Convoy, has suspended the determination for some time but convinced myself of the urgent necessity of an immediate reinforcement, & seeing no prospect of the so much to be wished for aid, I yesterday moved Congress to permit the troops to proceed by land, which after long, & warm debate was consented to. The Genl. was directed by a Resolve of the 4th Inst to put the Virginia line in motion for this place,(2) their being previously ready, I suppose they are so by this day. & in consequence of the Resolve yesterday, they will now continue their march with all possible expedition.

I have heard from several Quarters that the Legislature do not approve the Delegates drawing Money on Account from the Continental Treasury. Indeed I am a good Deal in the same Sentiment, And therefore have never done it. On this Footing I hope they will take the same Precaution. They did last year which was to entitle the  DECEMBER 10, 1779  Treasurer of the State to pay on aproved Account, without having it laid before the Houses for Approbation. The prodigious Exorbitancy of this City has brought me experimentally to know the Want of Money, and I must be under the Necessity of drawing in the recess. I can scarcely recollect so great a Dearth of News as at present. Every thing stagnant both at home and abroad. Our Dispatches in Congress are quite as barren as the Papers I have the Honour to enclose.

Perhaps it is from a like principle that I feel myself anxious to know the Complexion of publick Affairs in our State & the present Disposion of the People, especially as many interesting Events have taken place since I left it, such as the pressing Call of Congress for large sums of money-the Penobscott affair, a Regulating Act adopted & (as I am told) broke over-a new form of Government sent out &c &c. I tho't it rather strange that our Assembly should move for another Convention at Connecticut when our Regulations were crumbling to pieces. However at the Request of that Convention and the State of New Jersey, Congress have taken up the Matters and passed Resolves which you have doubtless seen. I wish to know your Oppinion whither a Genl. Regulating Law can now be carried into effect in our State after our late attempt, I own that I am doubtfull about the Matter, tho at the same time I think that at all events we must not flinch & leave our Sister States in the Lurch, as we were accusd. of doing in a similar case heretofore, and which is seriously remembered to this Day. It will not do to play the same game over again when the Convention Originated in our Court. I have not heard Whither the Assembly have taken any Measures to recruit our Regiments. It is an arduous Business in our present circumstances & I think ought to be early attended to; & also measures for clothing them. The North DECEMBER 13, 1779  Carolina & Virginia Troops are ordered to the Southward which (by the bye) I believe I should not have mentioned. The Report this morning is, that a Detachment of six or 8000 men are imbarking at N York their object is said to be either Virginia & the french ships there, or South Carolina. Another Report is that a Ship arrivd in the Deleware from France last night with Advice that the British & the combined Fleets are gone into their several ports, that the latter carried in with them the Duke, & British 90 gun ship, that no general Action had taken place.

Congress are employed in devising ways for supplying the Army at the least expence; for preserving the credit of our money; and defending the Southern States. The States I believe will be soon called upon to furnish such provisions, and other necessary articles for the war as they can supply with the greatest convenience, to be credited therefor in the quotas of monies to be raised by them respectively: (1) The Officers in the great civil departments of the Army, it is proposed, should hereafter instead of receiving commissions be paid by fixed Salaries &c &c.(2) The North Carolina Brigade are gone on for So. Carolina, and will be followed by the Virginia Troops. Our Intelligence from N. York is, that eight or ten thousand troops are about to embark. Their destination uncertain. I presume R. Island is not their object. The force is too great; and if so great a force should be employed in any other quarter there will not be troops enough to spare to attempt the repossession of that Island; so that I think our State will not be molested by the enemy this winter. We have late letters from Mr. Bingham continental agent at Martinico;(3) but not a word of news. No letters from our Plenipotentiary for some months past. The inclosed News-Paper will give you all the news we have. The Articles from Alicant I believe came to the French Consul here.(4) I wish they may be true. The destruction or capture of four of the enemy's capital ships would be a heavy blow indeed. All their dependence is upon the depretiation of our money. It is the great duty of every state to avert that mighty evil. The radical cure for depretiation is Taxation. I don't doubt but that our State will apply the remedy as far as it is in their power and do every thing within their exertions to produce a speedy and an honorable Peace. I am in great haste and as great respect, Yr Excellency's most obedt and most humble Servant, Wm. Ellery P.S. I hope your Excellency will excuse both the paper & writing.

He Insisted Strenously on the Equity of the Measure as did the Gentlemen from Maryland and Some others the Interest of whose Constituents lay or appeared to lay the other way, but they added If New York and such other States whose western bounds were Indefinite or were pretended to Extend to the South seas would be Contented with a reasonable western extent, It would Afford Satisfaction, prevent disputes and Complete the union, I answered that out of mere Curiosity I would wish to know their Ideas of 'a reasonable western extent, as they might widely differ from others, I was then Carried to the map and Mr. Sherman explained himself by drawing a line from the Northwest Corner of Pensylvania which is in lake Erie as laid down In the map thro the Strait which leads to Ontario and thro that lake and down the St Lawrence to the 45th degree of Lattitude for the bounds of New York In that Quarter. Virginia, the two Carolinas and Georgia he proposed be bound by the Alleghehany Mountains or at farthest by the Ohio to where It Enters the Missisippi and by that river below the Junction and he proposed that all the territory beyond the bounds I have mentioned and within the united States, should become the Joint property of the united States and to be in the disposal of Congress.

Under these impressions they have ordered a Considerable detachment from the grand Army to join the troops in Carolina; which together with the forces already there or on the way will amount to about four thousand men, exclusive of the militia of the southern States whom  DECEMBER 17, 1779  Congress have called for upon this Occasion. Congress have also Ordered three of their Frigates to Charlestown to be put under the direction of the Commanding Officer in that department. This force they conceive will make so powerful a diversion in favour of his Catholic Majesty's arms as to afford probable hopes of their being crowned with success. You will perceive, Sir, that any other co-operation with the troops of Spain is impossible while Savanna Opposes a barrier to a junction of our force. This from its present strength will not be easy for us to remove, till a more decided superiority in this quarter enables us to transfer a greater proportion of our Army thither, unless in the mean time the Governor of the Havannah shall think proper to furnish such aid, as when joined to the forces of the United States in that quarter will be sufficient to effect the purposes before mentioned. But as Congress are desirous of extending their Views still further, and Conceiving the Conquest of East Florida to be an Object of great importance as well to his Catholic Majesty as to these States, they have therefore directed me to inform you, and through you Don Juan de Miralles by whom the intentions of his Catholic Majesty are communicated, that they have given full power to their general Commanding in the southern department to correspond and concert with the Governor of the Havannah or any other person or persons Authorised by his Catholic Majesty for that purpose, such plan as can be agreed upon between them for carrying our Views into execution.(3) I am, Sir, directed further to inform You that though Congress cannot promise any Considerable quantity of provisions until the Army of the United States are supplied, yet as soon as this can be done every means will be used to furnish provisions for his Catholic Majesty's Islands and fleet. But in the mean time they Conceive that a large supply of rice may be Afforded by the State of South Carolina which Congress will readily aid the Agents of Spain in procuring.

I hope the Numbers of the Journals which your amiable Son has to deliver to you will prove duly consequent to those which you took with you from hence. I have already hinted to you the Risque into which the Secretaryship of the Embassy to France was thrown by Col. L's Nonacceptance.(1) Yesterday had been appointed for a new Choice, but passed without even a nomination, so that I hoped there would be some lucky offer of a Character in which Congress would see fit to unite for a Ballot. This morning, however, Mr. Mathews named G Morris, Mr. Ellery instantly named me, I named Col. Hamilton & Mr. Plater named Col. Steuart of Maryland. Having once intreated to have my Name taken back as you may remember, I was under a Necessity of remarking now that neither my own Opinion nor the Practice of Congress since that Period supported the Motives upon which I then proceeded-that I consented to let my name stand to Serve in Case in Necessity thro the Indetermination of Congress in regard to others. The mission is by no means my Wish. I find it will be painful to consent to accept it if it should be offered. One Thing, needless to mention, would be more painful. My predominating motives are of the preventive Kind. The members present are N.H. Peabody Mass. Gerry, Lovell, Holten, Partridge. R Is. Ellery  DECEMBER 17, 1779  Con. Huntington, Sherman, Ellsworth.

It is very doubtful to me whither Mr. Whipple will accept.(2) We are upon Measures to fill the Army & save Money. \""High Time\"" you may justly say. Genl. Green is desirous of relinquishing the Quartermastership but at a Time when there is no Forrage provided so that a Change would be dangerously critical at this day. The States must be called upon for Produce essential to the Army instead of Paper. I say nothing of News. Your Son will give you all that is passing. I must at this Hour of Midnight put a Fit of the Cholic into Bed. Heaven protect & prosper you by Land & Sea. Respectfully & affectionately Your Friend, James Lovell ""

"
8265,dg014335,1779,to William Livingston and Caleb Camp,""" to William Livingston and Caleb Camp   Sir Philada. 20 Decr. 1779 It is with reluctance I trouble you once and again on the critical Situation of Affairs at this Time. To cast round and examine the risques and Difficulties which stack up every where has a Tendency to send the Mind in every Direction for Succour. A Treasury without Money and an Army without Bread, is really alarming. I have already observed that the Failure of Supplies in the Staff-departments is unexpectedly great; but so it is, and the Question now is, the most immediate Means of providing against the worst of Consequences. In a Prospect so embarrassed, there is still however Hope and Encouragement, because the Means are among us, and the Mode of producing and applying them to the Exigency is not impracticable: and when the well-being, not to say Existence, of our Cause depends upon it, Importunity will be forgiven and every Exertion made. The Commissary General is now here; I have conversed with him fully. I write on the Evidence of his positive Declarations, that his Supplies are exceedingly small, and what he has cannot possibly get to Camp in Season to prevent an absolute Want of Bread. That the Army is already at short Allowance every where; in many Places totally destitute. It is not worth while to stand discussing Causes when the Effect is taking Place and the Moment calls for Interposition. I do not therefore wait at present to trouble the Legislature with Explanations, but do earnestly entreat, that, long as they have been together, they will not rise till Measures are taken to secure an immediate competent Supply of Flour, as far as it can possibly be had, and till a Plan is adopted to draw forth all the State can spare afterwards. In the request which went from Congress some Days since,(1) I could not but be of Opinion the Quantity was rather large, though it was not disproportionate to what was assigned to some others: however the Legislature can pretty well determine this Point. It is to be expected that what has always happened on similar Occasions, will again be the Case, that many who can spare will not, some for one reason others for another. Impressment has therefore  DECEMBER 20, 1779  become necessary, and in such Conjunctures, if in any, is justifiable. It is confessed to be an Evil, but the less of the two. If the Legislature cannot tarry to complete an adequate Plan, the Constitution of the Executive is such that, one would think, the best Citizen may feel himself perfectly secure in trusting it, even much farther, were it necessary, than an Extent like this which involves a little personal Property only. The Inconveniences which attend the Appointment of Agents in every County would seem to make four or five active intelligent Men preferable before the largest Number. Nor would this prevent the fullest Efforts of the disinterested and publick-spirited every where, or abstract from the Use of their Services. I am not capable to determine whether, at this Time, it would be best to put a Stop to the Continental Purchasers, though I suppose they are as numerous as ever, and do as little Good and receive as high Commissions. There is at the same Time a Danger from a Competition of Prices. The Allowance for the Flour till the first of February will probably be at the current, or however a generous Price, lest Complaint and Discouragement should take Place; and perhaps a Prospect of a falling Rate will induce a readier Supply. This representation has hitherto been confined to Flour, but I beg Leave to mention that Meat is not likely to be more plentiful, though there is a little Quantity more immediately within reach. Perhaps sufficient for some weeks without resorting to the salted, which is also dispersed and scanty. From the Commissary General I learn, that no considerable Purchases are making, his Deputies being out of Cash. I mention this as it may perhaps be thought adviseable to pay a little Attention to it also. It is unnecessary to detain you further than to explain a little more in Detail why so much Dependence is unavoidably placed on New Jersey, and their Interference more immediately requested. New York is nearly drained, not to mention that large Detachments of the Army are in that State; the Assembly of Pennsylvania are not together, nor could they be convened much, if any, sooner, than the Time to which they stand adjourned, and the Executive are not vested with Power adequate to the Object; as to the Supplies bought up in the adjacent States, they cannot be transported so as to reach the Army in Season, still less so, the Navigation of the Delaware being already interrupted. In the Southern Quarter a Post will be wanted for the Troops marching that Way. I enclose Resolutions of Congress of the 14 and 17 instant,(2) which have probably already reached His Excellency, the Governour from the President. Nearly all the radical Principles are adopted for a Change of those Systems which have so long been obnoxious to the People. I cannot but hope that the Alteration will be approved and useful. I have only further to beg Indulgence for the Liberties I have taken, with a sincere Intention to do what I thought right. Am, Sir, your obedt Servt, Wm Ch Houston  ""

8268,dg014338,1779,Roger Sherman to Jonathan Trumbull Sr,"""Roger Sherman to Jonathan Trumbull, Sr.   Sir Philadelphia Decr 20th. 1779 Your Excellency's Letter to Congress respecting the lessening the States Quota of the monthly Taxes, and retaining the money raised on the last continental Tax was referred to a Committee who report as to the first that it would be attended with great difficulty and inconvenience to alter the Quotas, of any of the States-and that the State of the continental Tresury will not admit of a compliance with the latter. They have reported to allow continental pay and rations to Militia raised for the defence of the State. The report has not been acted on by Congress, tho' I have moved Several times to have it considered. I Supposed it will be accepted.(1) There are very great complaints of the want of money in every department, and Congress depends wholly on the Several States for Supplies except what comes in to the loan offices. Warrants will be drawn on the Several States for the Monies that will become due by the first of January, and unless they are punctually answered very disagreable consequences may be expected. I was not here when Congress resolved not to Emitt Bills of Credit beyond the amount of two hundred Million dollars, but what remains of that is not near Sufficient to discharge the debts contracted by the Commissaries & Quarter Masters. Some Warrants have been already drawn on the State Treasuries And if there is not a very vigorous exertion of the States to aid in procuring Supplies not only of money but provisions the Army cannot be kept together. Congress has resolved to call on the Several States for their Quotas of the Supplies in kind, that are Necessary for carrying on the war, and to Credit all articles of the Same kind & quality at the Same prices, and other at proportionate prices. The Estimates and quotas are now preparing and as Soon as any State agrees and is prepared to procure its quota all purchases by Commissaries and Quarter Masters in Such State is to be discontinued. As to the quota of the monthly taxes, if Connecticut had not Suffered any by the Enemy its just Quota would not have exceeded 1,400,000 dollars, and North Carolinas ought to have been the Same whereas but 1,000,000 dollars per month is required of that State. I have heard of no complaint from any State except Connecticut as to the apportionment and Several of the States if not all have actually  DECEMBER 20, 1779  passed laws for raising the money-So that it would be difficult to alter the proportions; if the Honble Assembly of our State dont think proper to raise the whole I Should think it would be best to raise about 1,400,000 dollars per month and trust to Supplying the deficiency by Economy in expenditures, or Some other way. Col. Wadsworths resignation of his Office of Commissary General is accepted-and Col. Blaine is appointed but has not given his answer, & Col. Wadsworth and his deputies are requested to continue until a New one is ready to transact the business. General Green has requested leave to resign the Office of Quarter Master General, but it is not Yet granted. Jonathan Trumbull junr Esqr is Elected a Member of the Board of Treasury, the other members are present, transacting the Business and are very desirous to have him joyn them. I dont learn that he has yet given an Answer. I Suppose he has been duly notified of the appointment, I wish he may accept it. The Salary tho' it Sounds high is really low as prices are at present, but it is the intention of Congress that the Members of that Board Should have adequate Salaries. I hope we Shall before long return to our old Standard of Lawful money. A Committee consisting of a member from each State reported to recommend to the Several States to revise their laws making the paper currency a tender, and frame them So as to Prevent injustice to Debtors or Creditors, but it has not yet passed Congress.(2) For copying the resolutions recommending a general limitation of Prices the Secretary omitted that, approving the doings of the Hartford Convention, the whole are contained in the enclosed Paper-those resolutions passed nem. con. the good effect expected from them is to reduce the prices to a level in all the States, with expectation that by the operation of Taxes they may be kept So, and even reduced below the limitation. We have had no official Accounts from Europe Since the Minister of France came from thence. The Enclosed papers contain our latest Accounts from London. The Secretary Says that he transmits the Journals of Congress monthly to each State. Mr. Ellsworth arrived here last Wednesday. Mr. Huntington and he are well. I want to return home. Wish Col. Dyer or another of the Delegates would come as Soon as possible-we ought to have three at least constantly attending. The Assembly of Pennsylvania have passed a resolve to apply to the Assembly of Connecticut to Submit the Controversy respecting the disputed territory to be decided agreable to the Articles of Confederation.(3) I wish that controversy and every other of like kind were Settled right, but doubt whether this is a Suitable time to have it duly attended to. I am with the greatest respect, Your Excellency's humble Servant. Roger Sherman ""

These are mistakes of the French which the translator could not correct. As the delegates of the Massachusetts-Bay have given information to their State perhaps it may not be necessary to publish an advertisement on this occasion. If it should be done all the concerned can be notified at the same time. But of this as well as the mode of giving intelligence to Mr. Wood and the other Seamen your excellency is a proper judge. The Cry for money from every department is so vehement and peremptory, that unless the Treasury is very soon supplied the most alarming consequences will take place; therefore I hope that our and the other States will with all possible dispatch collect what may remain uncollected of their taxes. Congress are at their wits end. Unless taxation and loaning, expecially the first, goe on briskly, notwithstanding all our successful efforts, we may be undone. We are now at the very pinch of the game, if I may so express myself. If we can but supply our army a few months, without further emissions of money, the game is our own. We then can at our leisure, and as may be most just and convenient, appretiate our currency; and thereby force the enemy to make peace with us, whose whole dependence now is that our army will disband for want of supplies, and that we shall sink under the load of multiplied emissions of Paper  DECEMBER 21. 1779  Bills. The motives to vigorous exertions are great & pressing, I hope that the exertions of the several States will be proportionate. We have nothing new. I am with every sentiment of respect, Yr.

Several applications has been made to us as Delegates by persons from our State, to assist them in getting their friends out of prison here, that they might Remove them to the State of New York, which by their Extraordinary Solicitations we have been Induced to do; tho with great Reluctance, as we did not know whether it would be agreeable to you or not. (1) They have given Bonds for the Delivery of those Prisoners to the Commissioners at Poughkeepsie, or Albany. I hope they will fulfill their obligations. As we are at a loss to know whether it is proper to have them Removed from this State or not, we would beg if Such a Step is improper you would be pleased to Signifie it by a line; lest there Should be Some other application of a Similar Nature, and we be Induced to assist them without knowing whether it would be agreeable to the State or not. One obligation I enclosed to you a few Days Since by one Shearer it is against (Frear & Baker) the other is herewith Inclosed which I hope will Come Safe to hand. Congress have Resolved to Remove from this place the 1st of May next But have not yet Determined on the place where they will Remove to. You will not be surprized at their wish to Quit this City, when you are informed of the amazing Expense of Living here; Beef in the market Current at 3 Doll's pr. lb; pork four; wood 100 lb pr. Cord; flour 100 lb pr. hundred w't, and other things in proportion; it Seems as if the Devil was with all his Emmisaries let loose in this State to Ruin our money, and they, the authorities of this State are So Slow in the Collecting their taxes, that it will have but little Effect towards preventing it. However Critical and Difficult our Situation may be, yet it Cannot be improper you Should know it. Long Since Congress Resolved to DECEMBER 21, 1779  Stop the father Emition of money; Relying on the Taxes to be Raised in the Several States for Money to Carry on the war, with the Small Sums which they Expected to get by loaning. But alass what is our Situation! Our Treasury nearly Exhausted, Every Department out of Cash, no Magazines of provision laid up, our army Starving for want of Bread, on the Brink of a General Mutiny, and the prospect of a Spedy Supply is very Small. This is a meloncholly Situation and would give our Enemies great pleasure if they knew it. Under these Circumstances the grand Difficulty is to know what can be done for Relief, And it appears to me that if the Several States does not take on themselves to draw forth the Supplies for the use of the army, by a tax on the necessary articles, or Some other mode that may be in their power, God only knows what will become of us next Campaign; our army Cannot be kept together. But I'll Conclude the disagreable tale & Subscribe my Self your most Obed't & humble Serv't, Wm. Floyd Reprinted from Clinton, Papers (Hastings), 5:424 26. 1 In his January 6 reply to Floyd, Governor Clinton discouraged efforts to return captured New York Loyalists to the state. \""Except in some particular Instances where Persons have been previously captured by the Enemy & constrained to enter into their Service,\"" Clinton explained, \""it will be most agreable that they Continue under the Direction of the Comm'y Genl. of Prisoners, for Exchange & treated in every Respect as the other Prisoners of War. From Experience, we find that those who have joined the Enemy & have deserted from them & returned to the Country, are by no means profitable Members of the Community & we have no Reason to expect that those who we have made Prisoners will prove better. Besides, it is an Indulgence they are by no means entitled to & may serve as an Encouragement to others to be guilty of the like Treasonable Practices.\"" Ibid., p. 443.""

The present exigenci admits not of the least delay, it is therefore hoped that you will procure & forward with all possible expedition as much flour as can be obtained in your State which shall be passed to your Credit in part of its Quota lately called for and due care will be taken that Justice be done to the State. I am Sir &c, S.H. President (2) DECEMBER 21. 1779  ""

8272,dg014342,1779,James Lovell to Samuel Adams,"""James Lovell to Samuel Adams   Dear Sir Decr. 21 1779. This day your Favors of Novr. 23d & Decr. 2d to me, and one of the latter Date to Mr. Gerry & me came to Hand.(1) I am not a little pleased as well as honored by the Fullness of the Ballot which you mention. But you say nothing of a certain Resolve which is innuendoed in the following Letter. Copy Honble Delegates of Massachuts Boston Decr. 2d. 1779 Dear Sirs Before this reaches you, I imagine you will have recd. from the Secretary the Appointmt. of Delegates for 1780 in Congress; and as the Assembly have determined that the Delegates shall attend in Rotation, I request the favor to know yr. determinatn. with respect to yr. future Attendance, as it will influence my Conduct; if I do not hear from you, I shall set out so as to be at Congress the first Week in Jany. and attend there 3 months & then return home, as that will be the proportion of Time allotted me. I am now in the Assembly, Table covered with Papers & much Business, that I can only add, that my best wishes ever attend you for the perfect Enjoyment of health and Happiness, & am with real Esteem, Dear Sirs, yr very humble Servant, J. H.(2) As to myself I cannot comprehend how the rotatory Form of 3 months is calculated, nor is it essential to know, because the Probability is great that I may be on the Road when he himself is. For you must know that upon finding Goveur.(3) was named and was solicitous to be with Doctr F (4)in the Place of Laurens who declines, I did not insist upon my Name being struck off the List on which Mr. Ellery had put it in Consequence of Mr. Mathews naming Gr.3 I, however am so averse to going that I named Mr. Hamilton the Aid of Gl. Washington and Mr. Plater named a Col. Stewart. The House may do as they please I shall be satisfied allways but one. I declared my Unwillingness to go if the House appeared to be unembarrassed about another. This is a Situation quite ineligible to me, but I have not been chusing. I have been submitting to Situations for several years back. DECEMBER 21. 1779  If I do not go abroad, I cannot tarry here unless the State allow in some Proportion nearly resembling the Rise of Expences to me. You will be as much astonished when you come this Way as if you had not known Philadelphia last spring. The Example of 65 dollars for a pr. of Gloves that were high in Boston, at one, formerly, though Deerskins are plentier here than there may serve for a Clue to other Things. 10 & 12 Dollars for Butter is a Pretence for ruining Board. Murmur & Discontent must be the Consequence of the Taxation, for there certainly is not Currency enough circulating, for such Ratios of Demand. I will not say any Thing of the Wants of the Army at this severe Season, The Letter is bad enough already. Yr affectionate, J .L. [P.S.] Affairs of the nature of Capt. McNeilles have multiplied. Thompson & Saltonstall have made Applications,(5) but painful as the Condition of Individuals may be we have mightier Claims in too great number before us now to admit even of a prophesy when the former will be considered. We want immediately, four times more than all in the Treasury. We are dependent on the most strenuous Exertions of the States. I suspect Combinations of the speculating Kind against all our Expedients especially against that of our drawing Bills of Exchange. As to the Point of starving the army New York alone will prevent it, if only She can be certain that the Accounts of the Supplies from different States will be put on a just Ratio. But how can she give out her Produce at 12 or 15 or even 26 prices if this and other States have 50, 60, & 70, to be liquidated by Taxes hereafter imposed in the Citizens of New York in full Quota. I yesterday presented yr. Compliments at the Minister's. You have a Return in Kind. In the present Stage of Uncertainty you will be cautious of writing to me what may go into wrong hands. J.L. ""

8273,dg014343,1779,Thomas Burke to Joseph Reed,"""Thomas Burke to Joseph Reed   Sir Philadelphia Decr. 22d. 1779. The difficulties under which our affairs are now laboring cannot have escaped the attention of General Reed, A Gentleman So eminently trusted and respected by his Country, and whose Vigilence and abilities in her Service are so universally acknowledged and admired. Nor is it possible, but that his mind must have often been employed in Search of remedies for Evils So pressing and alarming. The Ideas of Such a mind may well be presumed to be important and a wish to call them out for public advantage will not, I hope, be deemed reprehensible. I wish for their assistance on an affair which now, officially employs my attention,(1) and I shall venture to request them without further apology. The Quarter masters and Commissaries tell us that our Army will be in great distress for forage and provisions-and at the Same time Say that enough is within reach, if Money could be had to pay for them. Under our present mode of Expenditure it is not possible to say, how much money will be Sufficient for this or any other public purpose, and no Expedient can be fallen upon for obtaining a present Supply without Committing, or degrading the public Credit. Congress have, at length resolved to call on the States for Specific quotas as well as quotas of money, but Some time must elapse before this, I hope, radical remedy can be applied with full Effect. To make provision for that Interval is extremely Necessary and highly Important. Our Immediate Supplies of Forage and provisions must come from the States of Pennsylvania and Jersey, and perhaps Delewar, New York and Connecticut. I am persuaded Some Efforts might be made by the Magistrates of those States which might Extricate us from our present difficulties, and give time for the general Contributions to Come in for our future and more regular relief. If such be practicable I doubt not it will be undertaken with alacrity, and Congress ought, and I doubt not will enter into the most liberal engagements to give Indemnification, and to make the burthen be equally born by the whole union. I request you Sir to Communicate to me your Ideas as well with respect to Such Efforts as can be Immediately made by the other States in the Vicinage of the Army as that over which you preside, and also as to the Engagements Congress ought to Enter into in return. My request is, as from an Individual to a Gentleman, in his private Character, but one whose Station and abilities enable him to give Satisfactory, and important Advice and Effectual aid towards Executing Measures which may be adopted in Consequence thereof. I am Sir, with unfeined Esteem and respect, your obdt. Sevt. Thos Burke ""

8274,dg014344,1779,Robert R Livingston to John Jay,"""Robert R. Livingston to John Jay   Dear John Philadelphia 22d Decr 1779 I am told there will be an opportunity of sendg. this to you, I wish therefore to embrace it tho as I know not how safe the conveyance may be, I shall only deal in general. You who know the share that you have in a heart too susceptible of tender emotion will easily believe the pain it gave me to find no token of your friendship, no farewell line at this place, where I hastened immediately after my election (1) with the pleasing, tho distant prospect of seeing you here. I discovered that a Letter that I had entrusted to Duer's care did not reach you till after your embarkation, & took up another Letter which I had given to the Govr. to forward to you, written immediately after the recd. of your's, which by a strange blunder of your brother, & the negligence of Benson was not till delivered in a week after it came to Kingston tho' I was there everyday.(2) By this time I flatter myself that in conformity to the wishes of your friends, you & yours are arrived, settled, & recovered from the fatigues of your voyage. A new world is opened to you, & how gay & pleasing so ever the prospects may be which it affords, you will meet with no mercy if you do not look back upon the friends you left in this, they have participated in the pains & dangers of your voyage, it is but just that they shd. share your pleasures. Things here remain much in the state in which they were when you left us. The campaign has ended without any thing decisive, & our Army is at present in a better state as to numbers & discipline than it has been at any period during the war, And upon the whole the ballance has been greatly in our favor, if we except the unfortunate attempt upon Savannah of which I dare say you have particular accts. by the brave, but unfortunate, Count De Estaing who has arrived before this time if his evil genious has not continued to persecute him. The Enemy seem desirous of availing themselves of their success, & as we are informed, are about detaching from 8, to 10,000 troops which are already embarked as is supposed for that quarter. They have not yet sailed owing to their ignorance of the Station of Count De Grass, who was said to be in Chesapeak bay tho' he has, as the Chevalier informs me, arrived at Dominique, & the rest of his squadron at Martinique, some what injured by a storm. We have a report  DECEMBER 22, 1779  in town that Pencola is taken by the Spanish troops,(3) I have not had leisure to inquire in to the truth of it tho from circumstances with which you are acquainted I give some credit to it. This is a wandring letter but I wish to crowd every thing in it which I can trust to paper that may serve to amuse you. Coll. Lawrance has resigned his secretaryship & tomorrow we are to have a new election, tho as I beleive none of the persons in nomination will be elected, at least not yet. They are Lovel-Morris- Coll. Steward put in nomination by Mr Plater & Coll Hamilton. Floyd has very improperly namd me, agt. my express declarations, both in publick & private that I wd. not accept it, & has obstinately refused to withdraw his nomination.(4) I mention this that you may not be surprized if you see me stand upon the list without a vote (for I think I shall be able to carry the State against myself) nor argue from it, that I wish to have the place, or that I want interest to obtain it-one of which I know, & the other believe to be untrue. Duer is likewise a candidate tho he has not yet been named (5)-nor will he venture upon it till he sees whether Morris fails which I believe he will. I shall endeavour to support him, but at present, Lovels interest is the best, tho', I imagine not sufficient to bring him thro'. My plan wd. be considering all things & the character of the two Ministers to send Mr. Carmichael to France & Morris to you, who best know his trim, how far this will succeed I know not. I could wish to settle a cipher with you that I might for the future write with more freedom than I can now dare to do. For want of which I must close after desiring you to remember me most affectionately to Mrs. Jay, the Coll, & Mr. Carmichael. I write nothing about your friends, as Caty will tell you by this conveyance that they are all well. I wd. copy this but for two reasons-1st Because I am too Lazy-2d Because finding me unchanged in my negligence, you may argue from thence that I am equally unchanged, in the sentiments of affection, with which I always have, & hope ever to continue to subscribe myself, Dear John, Your friend, Robt R.

8275,dg014345,1779,the Chevalier de La Luzerne,"""the Chevalier de La Luzerne   Sir. Philadelphia 22d Decr 1779. I did myself the honour to wait upon your Excellency this morning in order the more fully to explain to you the difficulties which obliged Congress to apply to Mr. Holker on the subject of supplies- But was so unfortunate as not to find you at home. Your Letter with which I was this day honoured affords me an opportunity to resume the subject & to assure you that nothing but the most urgent necessity & the express request of Genl. Washington could have induced Congress to make the application (1) At least if I may judge of the general sentiment by that which I feel on this occasion-for tho thro' the perfect confidence I repose in yr. Excellency I could overcome that reluctance which we have to discover our weakness more especially if it can be traced back to causes which it was in our power to forsee & guard against, Yet I could not so easily bring myself to make a demand which may have the most remote tendency to embarrass the affairs of those whom we have so many reasons to wish to serve. Your Excellencys Letter has greatly added to my difficulties not only by shewing the need that his majesty may have for these supplies but by the very polite & friendly manner in which you consent to sacrafice yr interest to our necessities. Under the influence of these sentiments I have requested the Comy. to exhaust every resourse rather than make any demand for the provisions shiped by Mr Holker, But to consider them as a deposit which nothing short of the ruin of our army shd. reduce us to apply to any other use than that for which they were originaly intended. Shd. we however find ourselves compelled to make the request your excellency will do me the justice to believe (as far as I am personally concerned in it) that it will be with a reluctance which nothing could conquer but my firm perswation that our interests are too nearly connected to be indifferent to our great Ally. There can be no doubt that the demands of the merchants to whom the ships belong will be satisfied by Congress. I flatter myself that am too well known to your Excellency to leave you the least room to doubt of my using my most strenuous endeavours with Congress to replace what your regard to our necessities may induce you lend from your stores. I have the honour to be with the sincerest profession of respect & esteem your &c.  DECEMBER 22, 1779  ""

The Dependence for money & most of the Supplies is now on the Several States & Drafts are now making on our State Treasurer with others for Large sums which I know we must be illy able to discharge after our Penobscot Loss &c however every exertion is necessary to maintain our Army and to Convince the Enemy that we do not depend for emitting money to it. Requisitions have been made on States for a present supply of Flour which I trust will be complyd with but have not heard what is done. The Inlistments of two thousand of the Massts. Troops will expire by the first of April next, & others at various Periods in the Spring & Summer as only about 15 or 16 hundred of our Quota were ingaged for the War, I mean of noncommissioned Officers & privates. Some other States have a Larger proportion for the war. There is some Danger in writing particulars least the Letter should fall into bad hands, but I think it necessary to give some information to those whom I know are disposd to exert themselves, to remove every Difficulty & to improve every information to the public Advantage . I design to be with you some time this Winter as I trust is expected from what passed before I left Boston. We are daily expecting Genl Hancock as he informd us that we might about this time.(2) ""

When I came here (1) I found our money depreciated beyond bounds and Congress taken up in finding out ways and means to remedy the evil. Before my arrival they had adopted the plan of recommending a limitation of prices to the different States, a place from which I do not promise myself much relief as I am apprehensive it will not be generally adopted. In the mean time they are busy in forming other Schemes of Finance, the foundation of which are loans both foreign and domestic. From these schemes likewise I fear nothing advantageous will arise. We have found it dangerous from experience to tamper with our money. Every step hitherto taken to appreciate it, having had the contrary effect. If we could check the expense in the departments of the Commissary and Quarter Master, I believe it would be a radical cure and until we do this, I shall think all other schemes useless. In order to do this, Congress seem determined to call on all the states for a certain part, of their Annual Quota of Continental Taxes, in kind, to be deposited in proper Magazines by such officers and at such places as the different States may think proper to direct. Upon the success of this plan, our salvation seems to me to depend, as by these means we should be able to do without a set of men who have taken care to amass most princely fortunes, at the same time that they have loaded us with debt and difficulties. I could descend to particulars on this subject, but it would carry me beyond the bounds of a letter. Thus Sir, I have endeavoured to give you an Idea of the present views of Congress, from which you will see that our situation is critical-as much depends on the measures we adopt.  DECEMBER 23. 1779  This letter is not designed for the public Eye, but merely to shew you how sensible I am of your friendship, and in return to request the favor of a line whenever leisure and opportunity permits.

8302,dg014372,1779,Cyrus Griffin to Ephraim Blaine,"""Cyrus Griffin to Ephraim Blaine   Wednesday [December, 1779] (1) C. Griffin's Compliments to Colonel Blaine-would be exceedingly obliged to him to order one Barrel of Beef and one of pork to be made up in the best manner for the table use of C.G.-he did not intend to have troubled the public officers in this way, and finding it impossible to maintain his house at the market prices without absolute destruction, solicited to return home, but the state not granting his request, he is obliged to have recourse to some few Articles from the Continent. C. Griffin has also recd. from time to time a few Barrels of Flour, but so unlucky as never to get but one that was good, and which was intended for another Member of Congress- therefore if Colonel Blain will also order one Barrel of the best flour and a few bushells of rye meal, he would take it a particular favor. C. Griffin's Direction is third street, near Lombard street. C.G. is obliged to pay all market expenses out of his own pocket, but whatever the Continent furnish, the State of Virginia will reimburse, which makes a very great difference in so ruinous a place as Philadelphia. However C.G. does not mean to encroach at all upon the Provisions allotted to the real subsistance of the army, but would sooner spend every shilling of his own Fortune. ""

Give me leave to hope that on serious Consideration you have determind to Accept your appointment, or at farthest will soon come to that determination . (1) Your Assistance, believe me, is much wished for & wanted in that Important department. The other two members Messers Foreman & Gibson have accepted, & entered upon the duties of their Office some time since. Alltho, the present nominal salary is of uncertain value, there is no doubt a decent Support will be allowd the members of the Treasury board. You Justly mention difficulties & Embarrassments, but my dear Sir let me Ask are there any difficulties Existing equal to what you & I expected when this Mighty Controversy began. I hope Sir Soon to hear of your Acceptance & wish for the pleasure to hear it from your own mouth. I have long been in the Sentiments you express, of the necessity of fixing a Standard for the currency, and am confident were it once fix'd it would remove many difficulties, but a free people must feel before they will unite in the necessary measures. I have ever been of one Opinion with regard to a regulating Act & now find my Sentiments coincide with yours on that Subject, but I find one Consolation very necessary in public life, that is to believe or at least act as if I did fully believe there are many wise men who can Judge better than myself on Important Subjects, & I have the happiness generally to unite in promoting their determinations, as  JANUARY 3, 1780  far as duty requires in any Sphere I am called to act in I am Sir with great Respect, your Obedient humb servt, Sam.

(1) We had not a Line from Doctr. Franklin. The Vessel bringing the Letters was sent, I suppose, by Gillon of 5th. Carolina, because almost all the Letters were for that State, tho the Leaden-Mass was directed to Congress. I have before said that I am astonished not a Line comes from you respecting either Vermont or the regulating Convention now sitting here. It is not less surprizing that we have only a Certificate of Election without any Reference to former Instructions.(2) You know that in the Cases of Georgia & North Carolina it was Determined that the Appointment of several Delegates to represent a State, without any specified No. for a Vote supposed Each one competent. New York demands that Priviledge. Virginia is now represented by one. And I believe every State must oeconomize, The Expence having become intollerable! I was vexed at ours and made Enquiry of Col. Floyd who is at Mrs. House's but I was far from bettering myself. He is charged forty times 40s for himself & 40 times 20s for his Servant and finds himself with every Thing but Bread, Meat & Lodging. Wood alone is an Estate. The Minister of France is incessant in his Invitations to dine in short weekly periodical. We have never invited him but once for which I dare say we shall have pd. 1000--600 of it & more being for the bare Dinner. We must either totally refuse his Invitations or be seemingly his Table Pensioners-or go into at least monthly Expence. This on a public Score. But what is to become of me on a private? I have been drawn on from one Fright of Prices to another till total Shabiness has come upon me. Indeed it is a Wonder I hang together, having bought one Suit & one Hat in 3 years. This latter hessian le haut being gone beyond Decency I am asked 400 Dollars.300 for a pr. of Leather Breeches-125 for Shoes-a Suit of Cloaths 1600-that is not 16 pr. of shoes but it is enough to stance my Children unless the State have raised the Allowance for Time & Service to some nearer Proportion to the Expences which they pay for my Sub- JANUARY 21, 1780  sistance here-or consider my decent Cloaths in the Line of my Charge of Expenditures.
