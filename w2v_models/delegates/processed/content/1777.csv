 JANUARY 1, 1777  My dear Sir Baltimore Jany 1. 1777 I am determind to omit no opportunity of writing to you although I have very seldom of late receivd a Letter from you. Your second Favor came to my hands a few days ago, inclosing Copies of Papers from Spain. I am much obligd to you for them. Our Affairs in Europe look well, and additional Measures have been taken here, to establish them in that Part of the World on a solid Foundation. I assure you, Business has been done since we came to this place, more to my Satisfaction than any or every Thing done before, excepting the Declaration of Independence which should have been made immediately after the l9th of April 75. Our Ministers abroad are directed to assure foreign Courts, that notwithstanding the artful and insidious Representations of the Emissaries of Britain to the Contrary, the Congress and People of the United States are determind to maintain their Independence at all Events.(1) This was done before the Success of our Arms in Jersey, of which you will doubtless have receivd Intelligence before this Letter will reach you. Generals Sullivan and Green commanded the two Divisions. The Enemy had before made Lee a Prisoner; but we have convincd them that great as his Abilities are we can beat them without him. I now think that Britain will make a contemptible Figure in America & Europe, but we must still make our utmost Exertions. Pray let the Levies required by our State be raisd with all possible Expedition. By this Conveyance you will have a Resolution vesting large Powers in General Washington, for a limitted time.(2) It became in my opinion necessary. The Hint I gave you some time ago I still think very important. Genl Gates arrivd here the day before yesterday. I have conversd with him upon it. He told me he had conceivd it before and wishes the Measure may be tryed. It requires Secrecy and Dispatch.(3) Lt Colo Stuart will set off tomorrow with Directions to proceed as far as Boston to purchase ordnance and other Stores, if they cannot be procured elsewhere. He is General Gates Aid de Camp & is very clever. I wish you would take Notice of him.(4)  But I am now called off. Adieu my Friend.  ""

  Honble. Sir Baltimore 1 January 1777  Congress relying on your wisdom and integrity, and well knowing the great importance of the case, have appointed you their Commissioner to negotiate a treaty of friendship & commerce with the Court of Spain. The idea of Congress on this subject you will find in the instructions of Congress sent by this opportunity to yourself and the other Commissioners at the Court of France. Your Commission for this special service we have now the honor to inclose you.(1)  We are with great Respect & Esteem, Honble. Sir, Yr. most obedt. & very huml Servts.

  My dear Sir Baltimore 1 Jany 1777 I have just Time to inclose You by the Express now going off, a Copy of the Letter recd from General Washington.(1) The middle States are roused from their late supine State, & are exerting themselves to reinforce the Army; I hope a proper Spirit will be exercised on this Occasion & the Enemy be driven from the Jersies. The General makes no Mention of the Corps that accomplished this affair, but I believe You will find them to be principally our Countrymen; I wish not to see Distinctions made, but think that to raise a laudable Emulation Justice ought always to be  JANUARY 1, 1777  done to enterprizing officers & Men. Great Commendations are given to the officers & Men (by General Gates who is here unwell) Which were sent the last Campaign to Ticonderoga. I wish they may know that their Conduct has done them Honor.  We cannot be too attentive to raise the new Levies & attach Men to the Service by supporting the Credit of the Continental Money, paying, Cloathing, Arming & subsisting them well. Let Us exert Ourselves to these purposes, & in twelve Months with the Blessing of God I doubt not We shall see the Independence of America established on a Foundation that cannot be shaken by the Arms of Tyranny. Pray recommend to the Inhabitants of the Country to supply the Commissary with Vegetables & Vinegar; from Want of these thousands have died in the last Campaign. The adjournment of Congress to this place I confess gave me pain, but the air is so much more exhilirating that Some capital Measures touching our Foreign Affairs have been taken which I think will be very serviceable, & I hope it on the whole will prove serviceable. I congratulate You on this Success of our army & salute You with the Compliments of the Season, being Sir, with much Esteem your very sincerely, E Gerry  P.S. The Tories must be exported; Bonds will not answer the purpose, prisons We have not a sufficiency, & they are not worth hanging. I observe in a very good Act of yours the Word \""Colony\"" is again used. Does it not look like Diffidence in your Right to the Terms of an \""Independant State?\""  ""

  Sir, Baltimore, Jany lt. 1777 I am to acknowledge the Receipt of your several Favours to the 27th Ulto. Your Letter of that Date, containing the very agreeable Intelligence of the Success of the Continental Arms under your Command, was last Night delivered to me by your Aid de Camp Colo. Baylor, together with the Hessian Standard.(1) I entertain the most pleasing Expectation that our Affairs will henceforth assume a better Complexion. Your Account of the Behaviour and Spirit of the Troops gave the highest Satisfaction to Congress; and manifests a Disposition which may prove the Forerunner of future Success. Considering the unfavourable Temper of the Men, broken by Fatigue & ill-Fortune, the happy Event of the Expedition appears the more extraordinary. But troops properly inspired, and animated by a just Confidence in their Leader will often exceed Expectation, or the Limits of Probability. As it is entirely to your Wisdom and Conduct the United States are indebted for the late Success of their Arms, the Pleasure you must naturally feel on the Occasion, will be pure and unmixt May you still proceed in the same Manner to acquire that Glory, which by your disinterested and magnanimous Behaviour you so highly merit.  I enclose to you a Copy of Resolves transmitted to Genl. Schuyler relative to the Northern Department, and also sundry other Resolves relative to your own immediate Department, which are all the Congress have come into since I wrote you last.(2) I have forwarded to all the States Copies of the Resolves vesting you with the Powers, which I had the Pleasure of transmitting in my last, accompanied with Letters explaining the Reasons on which Congress acted in that particular.(3)  From the enclosed Resolve you will percieve Congress have determined that a Horse, properly caparisoned, be presented to your Aid de Camp Colo. Baylor, and to recommend it to you to promote him to be a Colonel of a Regiment of Light Horse. As the Congress have been pleased to entrust me with the Execution of this Resolve, I must beg you will do me the Favour to give Directions to the Quarter Master, or other proper Person, to purchase as handsome a Horse for this Purpose, as can be found. The Reason of my making this Application, is an Information I had received that some Light Horse were taken at Trenton, and are to be publickly sold for the Benefit of the Soldiery. Should this be the Case, I must further ask the Favour of you to give Directions at the same Time to purchase one or two for my own Use. The Money shall be immediately remitted whatever it may be. I should be glad to know what Kind of Horse Furniture you think the most proper, as I would by all Means wish to procure the best, but without your Advice & Assistance, am apprehensive I shall not succeed. If the Horses are to be had, be pleased to  JANUARY 1, 1777  order them to be sent to me and every Expence shall be paid arising thereon.  This Recommendation of Colo. Baylor I doubt not will meet with your approbation, and that on his Return from Virginia, you will give him a Commission with such Pay as you shall think suitable and Adequate.  Wishing you very sincerely the Compliments of the Season, I have the Honour to be, with every Sentiment of Esteem & Regard, Sir, your most obedt. & very hble Servt. John Hancock Presidt  [P.S.] I shall Send you the Letter Books by the first safe hand.(4) By this oppory. I send you four Bundles containg two hundred Commissions, the rest shall immediately follow.(5)  ""

  My dear Hewes Baltimore Jany 1, 1777 I was favoured with two letters from you by Capt. Allon. I lament your hard fortune, and unless some measures are immediately taken to prevent the infamous practices of the Privateers, America will soon be in a state of general confusion-one Part warring against another, and the defenceless Southern colonies become a devoted prey to their more formidable Eastern neighbours. I laid your letter relative the Capture of the Brig Joseph before the congress without any embellishment or reserve. The New England Gentlemen, felt the force of the Imputation but considered it as too general. I have an order that our President should write the President and Council of Mass'tts requesting to make an immediate enquiry after the Vessell and the Pirates who have taken her, secure her and them & report immediately to congress. I have also procured a reference of your letter to the marine Committee, who I hope will take some spirited JANUARY 1, 1777  resolves to avenge the Injury done you and to prevent the repetition of such unjustifiable depredations. Morris is not here, but I have requested him in a letter which I wrote him yesterday enclosing yours to correspond with me upon the subject and exert his utmost endeavours to interest Congress in favour of your Application, by a publick epistle to our Honours. This is all which can be done at present, when I hear more particularly from you I shall prosecute every expedient to improve such information to your benefit.(1)  The Congress upon Part of G. Howe's Army advancing within 9 Miles of Cooper's ferry, by the advices of Mifflin and Putnam removed to this dirty infamous extravagant hole, where with all possible oeconomy we live at the rate of 50/ per day, Every necessary of life being double what they cost us in Philadelphia, & before we left that every thing was enormous.  In a letter which accompanies this I send you an account of the signal success obtained at Trenton. It has already had a fine effect upon our recruiting service, one Reg't whose term of Enlistment was expired having reenlisted to a man since that Event. It has operated the contrary effects on our Enemy-as from what we can learn they are Pannic Struck. Certain it is that 2000 which were at Bordentown moved towards Princeton with great Precipitation and carried off all their Stores with them.  The State of General Washingtons Army is pretty nearly as follows.  Of Lees detachments brought from the East Side of Hudsons  River about----------------------------------- 2300 effective men Other continental Regiments-------------------2700 Genl Cadwallader with 1200 Militia -----------1200 Genl Ewen perhaps as many-------------------1200 Militia come in & coming in very fast since the battle will make perhaps ----------------------_2000 10000 With these Genl Washington will I imagine again enter the Jersies and attempt to drive the Enemy back to New York. Should he succeed Your cause is safe, and my apprehensions about Philadelphia at an end. Howe has about 12,000 in the Jersies, Headquarters at Brunswick & the principal part of the army collected there, most of the outposts are called in, they have a small force at Princeton. Genl Washington is at Newton in Bucks County, where a plot was formed against him and his family, happily defeated by an early discovery of the Tories Intentions.  Lee's Capture surprizes us all. He was taken about 2 miles from his army where he had stopped to write answers to dispatches. A man in the neighbourhood immediately rode off to Brunswick 25 Miles distant, gave information, 80 or 90 light horse were immediately dispatched under the command of Col Harcourt who arrived about 10 oClock in the morning and surprised Lee and his Aid de Camps, 6 in number, at the writing table. A guard of 10 men which men unfortunately at a little distance from the house were cut off from communication with the Genl. Lee was   seized & denied the privilige of taking his Hat or Shoes. One of his Aid de Camp's was wounded in a small conflict they maintained in defence of their General. He was taken to Princeton-thence to Brunswick & then I hear very indifferently used, they intend I hear to send him to England. Stockden I hear is taken by the Enemy 8 Miles from his own home, carried to Brunswick & there confined to close jail.(2) Andrew, Will & John Allen are gone over to the Enemy. Dickinson a little questionable, but I will not believe him guilty till I have much better evidence of his Guilt than at present. There are several frigates cruizing on Delaware. Several intended for the Southward. So much for news.  I think myself rather hardly used that notwithstanding my many letters to Convention I have not a single line from them. Am or am I not a delegate? Penn writes me that he has obtained Assurances of being sent here, but expresses himself doubtfully of You and me; that he has interested himself in your and my favor. As to the latter he might have spared himself the Trouble. If the Services I have rendered Carolina in a publick Character will not secure me the unsollicited unanimous reappointment of my Country I want it not, I court not further fatigue, I am worn out with the duties of the Office & nothing under Heaven but a wish to promote the Cause of liberty should have kept me from my family and my own private Concerns till this.(3)  Adieu My dear friend. Remember me affectionately to our friends at Edenton. Shew this to Iredell & Jones & any body else who will excuse the precipitation with which I have scrawled it & consider that I have thrown this crude Inteligence on paper, in the midst of a publick Assembly & ten thousand things to divert my attention. Yours truly, W H  [ P S ] Besides the force aforementioned, Genl. Heath has retaken Fort Lee, & Hackinsack Town, with some stores & a few prisoners. Heath has about 2000 with him.  ""

  Sir,(1) Baltimore, 1 Jany. 1777 Your Favour of the 30 Novr came to hand last Evening for which I most sincerely thank you. I wrote to you the 15 Nov. which I hope you have recd.(2) Your observations of the Necessity of establishing a respectable Army are in my Judgment Very Proper. Congress have empowered Genl Washington to raise 16 Battalions in addition to those already granted and 3,000 Cavalry. Also have given the Genl a Power for six months to conduct at his Descretion the operations of the War, establish magazines, call upon the Militia when necessary, regulate every Department in the Army, Displace and appoint any officer below the Rank of Brigadr. Genl. &c. In a Word the Whole of the Military Department is put into his Hand for six Months. Upon this that the Preservation of the Civil Liberties of the People, at the present Time, depends upon the full Exertion of the Military Power. An Embargo for six months is laid upon salted Provisions.(3) For other matters of publick Intelligence referr you to the enclosed I hope We may obtain further advantages agt the Enemy in the Jersys. The Congress is this moment going off. I have only to say that We must have an Army, to carry on a War without one is a New Peice of Business. That they ought to be provided for in the best manner, and that without discipline they will not be serviceable and that if We can once bring one into the Feild, they will be much better provided for, disciplined and governed than they have hitherto been. In a Word I believe if We can get an Army it will be a good one-more happy themselves and more Beneficial to the Publick than any we have yet had.  Great Complaints are made that the Assemblys have appointed great Numbers of Very insufficient officers and have neglected the most apparent Merit.  Your kindness for me particularly exacts my Gratitude. I wish I was less sensible of the Injury I have recd. Any but those who have exercised Power to answer sinister Purposes to my Injury I can easily forgive, but JANUARY 1, 1777  these men I hope may deserve not only my Forgiveness but that of their Maker. I am at no Loss as to what they deserve. But God forbid that the Villany shall ever induce me to relax my Endeavours to serve my Country as farr as I am able. I saw the Baseness of these Mens Design and the Effect of my own undertaking in a good Degree contrary to my own Opinion I undertook, and therefore ought to suffer.

I hope We may flatter ourselves that further Advantage will be soon obtained in that Quarter. I have not yet heard what the Troops which went to R Island are about but I hope there Designs will be frustrated. Nothing of consequence from the Southward.

  My dear Sir Baltimore Jan 2 1777 It has been altogether from a Regard to your Safety that I have restraind myself from continuing on My part that Correspondence which you were obliging enough to indulge for several years. I know very well that your Avowal of and warm Attachmt to the Cause of Justice and truth, had renderd you exceedingly obnoxious to the Malice of the British King & his Ministers, and that a Letter written by a zealous Asserter of that Cause, and addressed to you, while you was in their Power would, if intercepted, have brought upon you the Resentment of that cruel & vindictive Court. But I cannot omit this opportunity of writing to you after so long a Silence, to assure you that I am still most heartily engagd according to my small Ability in supporting the Rights of America and of Mankind. In my last Letter to you near two years ago,(1) I ventured to give you my opinion, that if the British Troops then in Boston should attempt JANUARY 2, 1777  to march out in an hostile Manner, it would most surely effect a total and perpetual Separation of the two Countrys. This they did in a very short time, and the great Event has since taken place, sooner indeed than I expected it would, though in my opinion, not so soon as in Justice it might, & in sound Policy it ought. But there is a Timidity in our Nature which prevents our taking a decisive Part in the critical time and very few have fortitude enough to tell a Tyrant they are determind to be free. Our Delay has been dangerous to us; yet it has been attended with one Advantage. It has afforded to the World a strong Proof that oppressed & Insulted as we were, we were willing to give Britain time to recollect herself, and correct her own Errors. We are now enduring in the sharp conflict, confiding that righteous Heaven will not look with an indifferent Eye upon a Cause so manifestly just, and so interesting to Mankind. You are now called to act in a still more enlarged Sphere. Go on my Friend in the support of Liberty Virtue. You already have the Applause of virtuous Men, and may be assured of the Smiles of Heaven.

Deane, Franklin, & Lee, and wait their orders; when they discharge you, you are to return with the utmost diligence to America, & put into the most convenient port to the Southward of the Delaware.(1) We think Chincoteague, or some other on the back of the Eastern Shore, the most likely for avoiding men of War and would therefore have you attempt getting into one of those ports; when arrived you must leave the schooner under the command of your mate, and bring the dispatches yourself to Congress, wherever it may be Sitting. You are before you set out for Paris, to consult with Mr. Morris, or the above Gentlemen, whether your vessel will not be most likely to escape  JANUARY 2, 1777  the enemy by sending her to some other port to meet you on your return; if this should be their opinion, you are to give orders to your mate accordingly. You are also to deliver your pig iron to the order of those Gentlemen, and take from them such a quantity of military stores as will ballast your vessel. The Safe delivery of the dispatches, with which you are entrusted, & the obtaining answers to them, are matters of such immense consequence to the continent that We cannot too strongly recommend to you the avoiding all vessels, that you may see, either outward bound or on your return. You are also to avoid as much as possible, falling in with the Headlands & Islands, as it is most usual for Men of War to cruize off such places.  The Dispatches will be delivered to you in a Box, which you must put into a bag with two shots, that in case of falling in with an enemy, from which you cannot escape, you may be prepared to sink them which on Such an event's happening, we earnestly insist on your doing.

Washington yesterday for the purpose of paying the Bounty of Ten Dollars to the Troops that reinlist for Six Weeks, at the same time we told him the letters shou'd be sent forward directly and we did not doubt of the necessary supply of money being sent him soon as possible. You will please to observe our Fund is almost exhausted. Mr. Commissary Wharton called on us this Morning for Sixty thousand Dollars; we granted him forty JANUARY 2, 1777  thousand with a promise of more when that is expended. Mr. Wharton has now drawn from us 80,000 Dollars, 50,000 we lent the Council of Safety (which they are to repay when your supply to them comes up), 50,000 are Sent to Genl. Washington, so that only 20000 remains out of which we have made some payments; however we shall draw on the Loan office as occasion may require & we think it might be adviseable to lodge a further Fund of 200,000 Dollars with Mr Mease to be ready for any exigencys that may happen. As the Generals letter gives you the State of his army we need not add on that Subject except to assure you that he will gather daily Strength in militia. Sincerely do we wish that this may be the last time that American Militia will be called forth to the Field, for it is a measure thought the most destructive that could be devised.  The Enemies Ships still remain in our Bay & we fear they will do immense damage by intercepting numerous necessary supplys. Capt Hammond has discharged 47 Prisoners in consequence of Mr Morris's letter to him,(2) part of them are come up & Mr Bevan with the rest are on the Road, when he arrives we shall know the terms on which they have been dismissed. The Randolph, Hornet & Several other Vessells still remain at the Piers waiting some favourable opening to push out. Lt Colo Johnson & Major Frazer of Waynes Pensylvania Battalion called on us this morning, they say the men in that corps are as good Soldiers as any in America, but will not reinlist on any other Condition than being permitted to return home. Those terms being granted them and complied with they have no doubt of getting every Man & they, the officers, wou'd prefer them to fresh hands. We told them Congress had this matter before them upon the representation of Genl Schuyler &c, but they pressed us exceedingly to mention the matter to Congress & Urged in favour of the Pensylvania & Jersey Troops being sent down soon as possible, as the Garrison can easily be maintained by the Eastern Militia untill the New Regiments are formed & ordered up again.

Capt Doughty will go off the 4th or 5th with 400000 Dollars, & the Loan Office Certificates will either be sent by Express or under his Care to each of the New England Commissioners, who will also receive the necessary Directions.I will move in the Morning for a Warrant on the Loan offices of Connecticut & Massachusetts for 300000 Dollars, in your Favour, which answers all that is mentioned in your Letter relative to Business.(1) I am informed that in the New York Paper is the Copy of a Letter from the C. G. to a Memr of Congress wherein Colo Reed is censured; I have not seen it, or heard to whom it is directed-but shall not be surprized if to myself.(2)  I congratulate You on the Success of our Arms at Trentown; Our Men embrace every favourable oppertunity to give Tests of their Courage, & should be ever indulged in their martial Inclinations. The Regiments in the Detachment that attacked the Enemy were Reeds, Poor's, Starks, N.H.; Glover's, Sergeant's, Hutchinson's, Patterson's & Graton's, M.B.; Durky's, Ct.; Varnum's, R.I.; Stone's, Maryd.; & Reads, Weadons, Lauson's, Scot's & Buckner's, Virga., making in the whole 2500. The public should be apprized hereof, that by doing Justice to the brave, they may Excite them to nobler Acts & raise a laudable Emulation, free from Envy & Boasting, thro out America. JANUARY 2, 1777  The Lexington a Continental Frigate of 14 Guns arrived here this Morning from Cape Francois after having about ten days since been captured by a thirty two Gun Frigate. The officers were all taken out & about twelve or fifteen Men put on board her by them but the Wind being high they lost one of their Boats & were unable to add to this Number, in Consequence of wch. the Crew of the Lexington retook the vessel & arrived here with the following Cargo: 1400 Ells Cloaths & Coatg., 500 Ells Flannel & 300 of Oznab., 1 bbl. Salt petre, 200 thousand needles, 636 thousand pins, 366 reams paper, 386 Blankets, 12 3/4 Tons Sulphur, 5000 Flints, 500 stand arms with Bayonets, 7 1/2 Tons Lead & 8 Tons powder.(3)  I remain sir with much Esteem your Friend & humble serv,  E Gerry Jany 3d. The Order proposed in the first part of this Letter having passed Congress is now enclosed. I think it will be necessary to inform yourself from the Loan Office Commissioners who of them is or may be best supplyed with Money & inform the Treasurer that he may send an order accordingly.  In the Evening. I am just come from a Visit to our good Friend General Gates who is on the Recovery, which will doubtless give You pleasure. I suspect that a mercenary party at Albany have endeavoured to gravel you in supplying the Army, & find that at certain Times when there should have been two Months (or six Weeks at least) provisions in the Garrison, there has been only a Supply for the same Number of Days. This is a Matter of serious Concern, as the Enemy by investing the Garrison at such a Time, would oblige it to give them Battle upon their own Terms or retreat by the way of the new Road to the N E States. Pray inform me whether You can establish a Magazine of provisions at Bennington for an Army of 10000 Men three Months & keep up the usual Supplys notwithstandg opposition & without the assistance of the Albany Gentlemen; & if not, whether it would be a good plan to direct a certain Quantity to be provided in or near Albany by the York Convention or General Schuyler to supply the Militia that may occassionally come in, or answer any other Demands that may be found necessary during the next Campaign? & also what Quality of provisions & Quantity should be thus ordered? I think your powers & connections may render this needless, but as it can be done without interfering in your Department, if You think there is the least Chance of it's being necessary & advise thereto [it] shall be adopted. The Bearer brings the Certificates to the Commissioner of the loan offices in N England.  ""

The enclosed Resolves will inform you of the Measures Congress haw taken relative to the Northern Army, a Copy of which I have forwarded to Genl. Schuyler.(1) I transmit to you a Copy of the Circular Letter which Congress ordered to be sent to all the States, in Consequence of their vesting the Commander in Chief with the large and extensive powers I enclosed to you in my last.(2)  I am this Minute informed by Captain Boyce of the Marines, who was on Board the Lexington, that she was taken by the Pearle Frigate off the Capes of Delaware. The Weather proving extremely bad, only seven Hands were put on Board. In Consequence of which the Lexington's Crew rose; and having taken Possession of her, have brought safe into this Harbour. She is loaded with Powder, Arms, & dry Goods. I shall order her to be immediately unloaded, & dispatch her as fast as possible.  I must ask the Favour of you to send me by the next Express, Half a Ream of good Writing Paper, two Pounds of the best Sealing Wax, a Box JANUARY 2, 1777  of Wafers, and three Hundred of the best Quills.

  Dear Jefferson Baltimore Jany 2d 1777 Colo. Zane delivered your Letters to me in this Town, and as I had it not in my power to execute what you desir'd, I gave them to him and desir'd he would negotiate the Bill and transact the other business, which he promis'd to do.  Our affairs have had a black appearance for the two last months, but they say the Devil is not so black as he is painted. We have at last turn'd the Tables upon those Scoundrels by surprize, as you will see by the enclos'd paper. It was very unfortunate for us, that Ewing and Cadwalader could not get over the River, for it is almost certain, that they would have surprized a large Detachment of Hessians at Mount Holly, and most probably they would have taken the greatest part of them. The Number of prisoners exceeds what the General makes them by 500. He is always very moderate. Could we but get a good Regular Army we should soon clear the Continent of these damn'd Invaders. They play the very Devil with the Girls and even old Women to satisfy their libidinus appetities. There is Scarcely a Virgin to be found in the part of the Country that they have pass'd thro' and yet the Jersies will not turn out. Rapes, Rapine, and Murder are not sufficient to rouse the resentment of these People. If they be not sufficient provocations I dispair of any thing working them up to opposition. Your friends John, Andrew and William Allen are with General Howe; and Dickeson is they know not where, but it is imagined that he is on board the Roebuck. This Gentleman, after giving his Vote repeatedly in Congress, for the emission of Continental Money, wrote to his Brother not to receive any of it in payment for his Debts, and his Letter was intercepted by the Council of Safety.(1) What does he deserve?  The Allens have humm'd themselves finely, for when they went to Howe, there was very little doubt, but he would shortly have been in possession of Philada., as indeed he might, had he play'd his Cards well; but now I am in hopes that will not take place, and that they will be treated as they deserve. There are some of the vilest Rascals in the City and Neighbourhood of Philadelphia that ever existed.  The General was inform'd a few nights ago, that a conspiracy was form'd by some people in Bucks County near his Camp to kidnap him as poor Lee was, but he has more prudence than to be caught in that manner, however the disposition of the Inhabitants of that County appears to be inimical to our cause, which you knew before. Adieu,  Thos Nelson Jr.  [P.S.] You dont like long Letters more than myself.  Our little friend Hopkinson has suffer'd greatly by these Free booters; They have destroy'd all his furniture, Cabinet of Curiosities and his fine  JANUARY 3, 1777  Harpsicord, which I am told was the best that ever came to America. You Have little chance for the Tellescope. Old Weatherspoon has not escap'd their fury. They have burnt his Library. It grieves him much that he has lost his controversial Tracts. He would lay aside the Cloth to take revenge of them. I believe he would send them to the Devil if he could, I am sure I would. Thus endeth the postscript.  ""

  Sir Philada. Jany 3d. 1777,10 oClock A.M. An Express arrived here this morning with the enclosed letters from Rhode Island, the one from Mr Tillinghast informs the arrival of the Alfred at Boston & of her Prize Ship the Millish at Port Bedford, those to Mr. Ellery may probably give you the State of the Enemies Forces at Rhode Island & the letters directed to Genl. Lee, Mr Morris opened as knowing & in some degree being entrusted with his private affairs, and if they were on Publick business (which proves to be the case) the Contents ought to be known. The Express that brought these letters was dispatched by Governor Cooke, therefore we suppose the letters to Mr. Ellery are of Consequence.(1) As none that we have opened made it necessary to incur the Charges, and as he is jaded as well as his Horse, We have told him to wait the return of your answer to this, when Mr Ellery or your instructions respecting him shall be Complyed with.  We are this moment in the utmost state of Anxiety as we have reason to think an engagement was Commenced this morning the decision of which will have the most important Consequences to all America. Capt James Nicholson (of the Frigate Virga.) came down from Trenton about an hour ago & says that Genl Mifflin & Genl Cadwallader joined Genl. Washington yesterday in the forenoon, that he immagines a plan of attacking the Enemy had been Concerted & was to have been executed this day, that Ld Stirling's and Colo Hands Brigades had been sent from Trenton on the Road to Prince Town yester forenoon and that about one oClock they fired the alarm Guns, about three miles from Trenton where they met the Enemy who pressed on them with Superiour Numbers and these two Brigades supported a retreating engagement from that time untill Sunset when they joined our main army which had taken Post & was drawn up on the high grounds on this side Trenton Bridge. The loss of the Two Brigades Capt Nicholson thinks was inconsiderable, he saw but two or three wounded men come in & dont immagine the whole loss can amount to 100 men. He says our Troops must have suffered much from the severe Cold of last night. They have been much harrassed & cou'd not get comfortable sleep whilst the Two armies were so near, the advance Guards not 100 yards from each other. No Certainty of the Enemies numbers but from what he saw, he judges they might be 6 to 7000. This morning he heard them engaged and he is in hopes that the attack was made by our People. He says it was the opinion of some of our General Officers that they shou'd make the attack this morning, and at all events he thinks they will be obliged to beat the Enemy or be cut to pieces, for there is not a Boat or Canoe between Trenton & Burlington and if they attempt a retreat he thinks the Enemy will press on them to their destruc- JANUARY 3, 1777  tion. Thus sir, We are waiting the Event of this most Important Action and write what we think that we may be prepared to give quick dispatch to the Express after we hear farther. The Council of Safety are dispatching up the Gondolos again & other Craft to be ready for such Service as may offer & it is a happiness that the old Ice is gone & no new made. We hold ourselves in readiness to do whatever Circumstances may require from us & happy indeed shall we be to give you good news at the close of this letter.  It is now 6 oClock in the Evening. We have waited impatiently all day for fresh accounts from Trenton, but no person has come in from thence since Capt Nicholson but Mr. Tod the Coachmaker who is one of the Light Horse of this City. He says he left our Camp at 2 oClock this morning and cannot give us any further Acct than Capt Nicholson has already done He says also that he heard only 10 Canon fired this morning but there are others who insist they heard a brisk canonade from daylight [to] 10 or 11 oClock, this is said both in Town or Country, in short Sir We are very sorry to send of an Express with these imperfect Accounts, but We fear if we do not this night inform you of what we have heard, you may be alarmed by Travellers with reports that will give the Congress immense pain. Therefore we dispatch this express & keep another ready for the morning, begging you will not be uneasy untill you hear from us, for be the event good or bad you shall be informed when any thing to be depended on comes to our knowledge. At this time we must observe that if we had met with any severe check, there wou'd have been numbers in, to tell the news. If we get the better, all will be willing to share the glory to the last and not fly to tell us what is passing. If we remain formidable nobody will be dispatched to tell us it; therefore the longer we remain in suspence the more favourable may be our conjectures.  Sorry we are to Close this letter with one disagreable piece of intelligence. Capt Hallock late of the Brigt Lexington appeared here a little while since he was taken by the Pearle Man of War in a Gale of Wind which was too high for the Enemy to take proper possession of her they sent a Midshipman & seven men onboard, took out Hallock, his Lieutt & some other officers for that night, intending to secure her better next morning but she parted & Hallock thinks his officers had retaken & carried her into some other port. He took a Brigt from the Bay of Honduras & ordered her for the first safe Port. We are mortifyed exceedingly at this affair but if Genl Washington drives back the Enemy from Trenton we will seek revenge & with great respect remain Sir Your obedt Servants.

  My Dear Sir, Baltimore 3d Jany 1777  I some time ago desired you to look for two fast sailing vessels of about 60 to 80 tons to send here for iron and flour for the use of the Navy since which I am instructed by the Marine Committee to desire that you will immediately send two vessels to this place for those articles.(1) I hope there will be no difficulty in chartering them, this will be a considerable advantage to the State of New Hampshire as great part of the flour may be disposed of if it should be wanted as undoubtedly will be the case. You'll address these vessels to Messrs Saml and Robert Purviance, merchant here who will give them all possible dispatch, you have liberty to ship in each of them from two to three thousand dollars value in such articles as will best suit this market of which you will be informed by the Price Current inclosed by your govt.  By this conveyance, you'll receive directions from the Secret Committee, to load a ship with masts for France if you can purchase one suitable for masts.(2) This is an article that will be very acceptable there at this time, as  JANUARY 4, 1777  in all probability that nation is at the eve of a war. You will also be desired to send two small vessels to St Peters if you can procure suitable cargos for that market. I am apprehensive you'll want money by the time you get through this business, which will be sent you so soon as you let me know what sums you'll want. I wish to be constantly advised of your proceeding and of your wants that I may keep them supplied. The last letter I rec'd from you was of the 25th Novr.(3)  Since my last the Lexington arrived here from the Cape. She was bound to Philadelphia but was taken by the Pearl frigate of 32 guns off them Capes, who took out all the officers and put on board 7 or 8 men but the roughness of the weather prevented their taking out the people which were about 70 in number who under cover of the night brought her off and arrived safe here with a very valuable cargo of powder, arms, woolen goods &c. There is also another brig arrived here from the same place and same sort of cargo amounted to 200.000 livres. The last account from the army was 29th ulto. They were then following the enemy and hope they'll not stop till they have either destroyed them or drove them out of Jersey. The whole number taken at Trenton was about 1100-among which were 7 field officers-a few more such day's work as that of the 26th will cause our stocks to rise. It's now between 2 and 3 o'clock A.M. and I can hardly see. You'll therefore excuse this scratch. Your friend &c, Wm Whipple  ""

  Sir, Baltimore Jany. 4th 1777 Inclosed is a Letter to your Honor which was handed to Me by a Gentleman of the Secret Committee, who told me at the same Time that it came via South Carolina, and that the 21st of Oct. Preparations for War were making in France, but your Letter will doubtless furnish you with Intelligence on that Subject.  Since my last (1) nothing remarkable hath occurred. Several more of the Hessians who were posted at Trenton have since the late glorious exploit of Genl Washington been found skulking in cellars and other hiding Places among whom are One Lt Colonel and a Deputy Adjutant General, so that the whole Number when the Genl. wrote last, which was JANUARY 4, 1777  the 29 or 30th of Decr., amounted to about One Thousand. This important Manceuvre hath given great Spirits to the good People in the Jersey and Pennsylvania, and they are flocking from those States to Genl. Washington. Some of the Militia too from the Lower Counties, from Maryland and Virginia are repairing to Philadelphia. Our Army by the last Accounts had rerepassed the Delaware and were in full Pursuit of the Enemy, who had deserted all their Posts on that River. Some of our Troops were within five Miles of a Body of Hessians, who had, its said, a hundred Waggons loaded with Stores &c with them, who, with their Stores, will in all Probability fall into our Hands; at least their Waggons, as our Men can doubtless move faster than they, will be taken by Us; and our main Body was within Eleven Miles March of the Enemy. Every Thing on the West Side of the North River wears now a brilliant Aspect. Genl. Heath hath entered Hackinsack and taken all the Stores amounting to a large Quantity, a few British Troops who had been left there to guard them, and some Tories. I am now confident that We shall drive the Enemy out of the Jersey. I am extremely anxious to hear how Affairs are in our State. The late masterly Stroke at Trenton, which would have been capital if the Ice had not prevented the execution of the Genls Plan in some of its Parts, will I hope animate our and the neighbouring States and urge them on to some noble Enterprize, against the Enemy in our Quarter. Much depends upon vigorous Efforts this Winter. Large Bodies of Militia will I trust be there as they are here collected and collecting, and make a bold grand Burst on the Foes to our Happiness. Seize the Opportunity which a Division of the Force of our Enemies hath given Us. Reinforcements, unless France should effectually interpose and prevent it, will infallibly be sent over in the Spring or early in the Summer. Therefore let me repeat it, seize the Occasion which the ill Policy of the Enemy presents. Burn the hostile Fleet, and drive the Enemy from Rhode Island if it be possible.  The Express, which will deliver this to you, carries the Loan Certificates to New York and the New England States. I hope this Plan for stopping the Progress of Depretiation will meet with Encouragement from our and all of the States. It gives me great Pleasure to find that our State hath appointed a Committee to consult with Committees from the other New England States upon Measures to prevent Depretiation and Monopolization. I know no better Way to effect the first than by lessning the Quantity of Paper-Bills, nor the latter than the State of Connecticutt hath pursued. Monopolizing especially at such a distressing Time as this is most certainly highly criminal, and demands severe Punishment; and the Blood in the political System ought to be kept pure and incorrupt. From the Depretiation of our Money, and the Obstructions of Commerce, those Articles which are imported are risen to an astonishing Height, and every other Article keeps Pace with them. I thought   that Philadelphia was the dearest Place that ever I knew. Baltimore exceeds it. On this Account, on Account of its Distance from the Scene of War, and on Account of its being the dirtiest Place I ever saw, I most sincerely wish myself back to Philadelphia, which I left with great Reluctance. By a Letter which I receiv'd from Newport on the 6th of Dec. I am led to hope that my Wife and Children have escaped from Newport. If they should be Prisoners I hope you will promote their Freedom.

  Sir, Baltimore the 4th of January 1777  We have thought the expence of an Express warranted to carry you the inclosed, some of the contents demanding the most serious attention, & the quickest possible change in the situation of things that made those observations necessary. It is very true that we have exerted ourselves, but in some instances we have been unfortunate, and the difficulty of getting ships and seamen is certainly very great. However, you will see that ballances are against us, and considerably so, both in the West Indies, and in Europe. That in consequence of this, our credit is hurt, at least, with Mr. Schweishauzer who seems unwilling to go an inch beyond what he has in hand. Good often springs out evil, and so, by the Friendship loosing her topmast, she made for Chesapeake and is safely arrived here with her cargo, which might have fallen into the enemies hands if the Brig had kept on for Delaware. We shall take care of this Cargo here, but the Vessel we wish your advice & assistance about.(1) We are agreed to charter her again if this can be done on terms that you approve, and here she may be immediately loaded, with Tobacco at least, and ordered to the place where you judge remittance to be most wanted. Will you Sir do, and advise us in this, what you think best. The Captain of the Friendship will wait here until the return of this Express. You will see the advance made by our Agent for arming the Brig. The books of the secret Committee are not here, nor any of the papers, so that we are illy fitted for conducting the business properly.  Mr. Gillon having imported into So Carolina, on his contract, 37,550 lbs. of Gunpowder, 500 stand of arms & 620 bushels of salt, we have paid him for the present £3500 this currency, for his part, upon account. We learn from Colo. Harrison that a Ship sometime loaded by his son in James River remains for want of seamen.  Richard Henry Lee  Fra. Lewis Wm. Whipple P.S. We inclose you an order on Meade & Co. for £481.7.11 Pen. Cury. The Post coming in just now we shall send these dispatches by her.

I am glad to hear that People are well inclined to lodge their Money in this office, as it is putting their Money to the best publick use, and also will be a Means of preventing a Redundancy of the common Circulation.

This Severity May be (as I understand in many Instances it has been) a Means of convincing the unbeleiving of the Cruelty of the Power which oppresses Us.  Congress have directed Three Thousand of Cavalry and Sixteen additional Battalions of Infantry to be raised together with a Number of Artillerists, and have passed other Resolutions relative to the .Army which they judged necessary to give it the greatest Energy, so that no Impediment or delay might prevent the fullest Exertions of the Military Power which Regulations you may Soon be more particularly informed of, as well as of the Reasons on which they are founded.

  Sir Philada Jany 5th. 1777, 10 oClock We have no doubt but our last letter by express will cause the Congress to be very anxious for further Accounts. Since that letter was dispatched we have remained entirely in a State of the most anxious expectation, always keeping an express ready to carry you any News that we cou'd write with certainty but as we have no certainty to this hour you will please to accept of the Substance of current reports brought down by various persons & which in general have gained belief here. We told you in our last that Genl Washington had drawn up his Army & taken post on the Hills on this side Trenton Bridge. He caused large Fires to be made & kept up and haveing recd certain intelligence that Genl Howe with a considerable reinforcement was on his march from Prince Town to join the Main Body at Trenton he decamped in the middle of that night, made a forced march & met Mr Howe about Maidenhead or at Quaker Bridge, gave him Battle, put him to the rout & took 500 to 700 Prisoners, pushed forward, took possession of Prince Town and 8 ps. of Canon, with a Number of Officers & the 40th Regiment & this Morning we are told he was still pursuing and determined to push on to Brunswick where are all the Enemies Valuable Stores &c.  That part of the Enemies army that possessed the part of Trenton on the other side of the Bridge never discovered Genl Washingtons march untill they heard the engagement. They then took possession of all the Heights and remained under Arms untill about Eleven oClock, when they marched of by the Penny Town Road, in order as is supposed to get on the other side our Army & join their Genl Howe. Genl Putnam march'd from hence yesterday with about 600 men, 500 follow to day & more are coming in every hour. We hear various reports of Genl.

  Sir Philada. Jany 5th. 1777  We embrace the opportunity of Mr Leman & Mr Penrose two Gentn of the Light Horse to forward Seven Packets that came to our hands from Congress last Night. These Packets contain sundry resolves of Congress & a Number of blank Commissions.  The uncertain rumours of your Excellency's Success between Trenton & Prince Town and at the latter place, leave us in a most anxious State of suspence hoping every moment to be relieved therefrom by an express with dispatches from you.  We informed Congress of your situation on Thursday Evening at Trenton & prepared them to expect some important event, consequently they will have an anxious interval of Suspence as we now have.  The Continental Brigt Lexington, Cap Hallock, was taken by the British Frigate Pearle, Cap Wilkinson, but the Wind blowing hard & the Sea Running high they cou'd only take out Capt Hallock, his Lieutt & other principal officers & in lieu of them they put onboard an officer & 8 Men with orders to keep Company untill morning. Before that came Our People onboard the Brigt rose upon the British, bore away & have carried her Safe into Baltimore, by which means further supplys of Military Stores & Cloathing are secured as there is onbd Powder, Lead, Muskets, Blankets, Cloths &c. The Andrew Doria Prize is also arrived safe here. We suppose her late Commander Capt Jones must be given up for Cap Hallock who is come up from the Pearle under Parole.  Waiting impatiently for important News from you & with the best wishes for a Continuency of Success We remain Your Excellencys Obed Servants, Geo Walton  Geo Clymer Rob Morris ""

  Dear General (1) Baltimore 5 January 1777  Nothing could have happened more opportunely than the drubbing you have given the Hessians at Trenton. God grant the blow may be followed up until you expell these Robbers from the Jersies at least. If they do not get severe castigation for their late maneuvres in Jersey, they will sophisticate all Europe with lies. The genius of America seems now to be awakening from profound sleep. Let the moment be improved for making a vigorous and decisive impression. We have had several valuable arrivals lately with powders, woolens and arms. More are daily expected. But you seem now to have got into a shorter and surer method of obtaining these things by stripping the enemy. I heartily approve the plan. I am still of opinion that the Spring torch will light up a general war in Europe, but still we should be prepared to receive the enemy in every quarter. Both in public and in private as little should rest upon externals as possible.  Will you please to tell our Major Parker that I will forward his commission by the first good opportunity. Congress has adopted the European plan in offering six Hessian field officers for Gen. Lee. If it is not accepted, I hope a noble feud will take place between these foreigners and their British Allies.  I am, as of old, your affectionate friend, Richard Henry Lee  ""

  Sir Philada. Jany 6th. 1777 12 oClock We wrote you a few lines yesterday by Mr Murdock stating the Current reports as they then appeared to us. Since some alterations appear & we shall give you the present State of intelligence as we have just received it from Mr John Brown a Young Man of good Credit who was in the Action near Prince Town. He says that on Thursday Evening Genl Washington took post as mentioned in our former letters on the Heights on this side Trenton Bridge, that about 12 oClock that night, Genl Cadwalladers Brigade (to which Brown belongs) had orders to march, the rest followed, that they took a Circle & came into the Prince Road & about a mile on this side of that Town they found a party of the Enemy had posted themselves very advantageously, behind a Fence, their artillery in an orchard & a large part of their number so covered by a Hill that they cou'd not be hurt. The Philada associators being in Front were exposed to the first Fire of the Enemy. They were very eager & run up a Hill before they were formed. The artillery played so hot on them that they got into Confusion & retreated down the Hill again, there formed, marched up in good order, attacked & broke them, they pursued into Prince Town & found this party Consisted of 600 men. We took 140 Prisoners there, killed in the action & on the Road & at Prince Town about 100 Men & the Rifle Men who pursued the scattered remains of the Enemy brought in about 40 Prisoners. We took five Field pieces, a Howitzer, a Considerable Number of Blankets & as many stores of different kinds as our Waggons cou'd carry off. The Genl. did not think proper to make any stay at Prince Town knowing the Force of the Enemy left in his Rear to be very considerable and fearing to bring on a general Action whilst his Troops were so extreamly fatigued. They had neither Victuals nor Sleep from the time they quitted Trenton, & all their bagage left behind so that they were suffering extreamly with Cold, Hunger & Fatigue. In this Condition they pushed on untill they Crossed Mill Stone Creek & then leaving the Brunswick Road, they crossed to Somerset Court House a place distant about 7 to 9 Miles from Brunswick where they halted & staid that Night (Friday Night). On the March to this place a good many of our People got scatterd & parted from the army. Mr Brown was one of these, got lost in the Woods & almost famished & at length after meeting relief at some Country House he found some of the Enemy had got between him & our People, therefore he made back for this place. He says Genl Mercer & a Colo Yates of Virginia are killed, also a Capt Shippen of Mari[land]. These are the only officers of distinction lost on our side that he knows off & about 15 Privates. The Enemy had killed a Colo, a major, two or three Captains & about a dozen officers taken as he was told. He says that our army were in excellent Spirits JANUARY 6, 1777  notwithstanding their Fatigue and he understood that Genl Heath was at Morris Town with a considerable number of Troops and was to join Genl Washington on Saturday, when they were to Surround Brunswick & attack it in all quarters. This is nearly the substance of Mr Browns account. You may fully depend that what he relates is exactly what he has seen & heard being a Young Man of Veracity. Capt James Nicholson has also just returned from Trenton again, he confirms all the above particulars having heard them at Trenton from other persons that had come in there. He adds also that an Express was come down from Genl. Washington to Genl. Putnam & pushed on from Trenton to Bordentown where he expected to meet him yesterday, & by the enclosed letter from Genl Putnam you will perceive he Crossed yesterday to Burlington & the Force he has with him; more are following constantly. Capt Nicholson further says that the Enemies Troops that lodged in Trenton on Thursday night, pushed for Prince Town soon as they missed our army, that they were greatly fatigued & harrassed & that the Country between Trenton & Prince Town was full of Stragglers that cou'd not get on fast enough that they generally quitted the Road, got into the Woods and lost themselves & were divided into small parties of threes & fours, some of which came into Trenton & surrendered whilst he was there & the Country Militia having begun to rise was picking them up & bringing them in very fast. Those that surrendered said great Numbers of their Countrymen wou'd come in if they knew how well they wou'd be treated. It is now said that Ld Cornwallis Commands the Main Body of the Enemy consisting of between 4 & 5000 that was at Trenton & that Genl Howe is at Brunswick with about 3 or 4000. Genl. Washingtons Force we do not know but it was judged by Mr Brown to be 12,000. We think that is impossible, however he says the Country is undoubtedly rising & that he will gather Strength every day. Genl Heath is said to have from 3 to 7000 but we have no Certainty respecting him. The bearer of this who came express from Boston says he heard Genl. Heath was at Pecks Kill. Upon the whole, we are in a state of much uncertainty & anxiety, but hope soon to be agreably relieved from it, our Militia come in daily. Colo Flemings Battalion is near at hand, part of Cooks is already here, the Jersey Militia turning out and our army will grow too formidable for the Enemy be the Event at Brunswick what it may. We know Congress will be anxious & soon as we can give it, they shall have information of what happens.  We opened the dispatches from Boston but finding our interposition unnecessary we send on the Express with these dispatches & this letter. You will find enclosed the Copy of a letter from Major Hubley & thereby learn the success of Major Mifflins expedition. You have also enclosed a letter from J. Trumbull, D. paymaster Genl. at Albany. Capt Hallock & his officers will go down to day to the Lexington but they must not go   out in her unless an exchange is made. We are in haste having detained the Express whilst we wrote this account but always, Sir, Your & the Congresses, most Obedt Servants, Robt Morris  Geo Clymer Geo Walton ""

  Sir, Baltimore Jany 6th. 1777  I have the Pleasure to enclose you sundry Resolves, Copies of which I have forwarded by this Express to Genl. Washington.  Genl. Lee's Situation has become rather critical and dangerous, as it is not improbable from Genl. Howe's Treatment of him, that he intends to bring him to Trial for Desertion. Mr. Eustace, his Aid de Camp, who arrived here last Night, says that Genl. Lee sent two Letters to Genl. Howe, both which were returned unopened, and enclosed under a Cover directed to Lieutenant Colonel Lee.  If Genl. Washington's Flag to enquire in what Manner he was treated and a spirited Remonstrance, should he have found it necessary to send one, have been dispatched, I am in Hopes, they will have a proper Effect, and induce Mr. Howe to lay aside all Thoughts of trying him, if he ever really entertained such Views. The late Success of this Gentleman has emboldened him to pull off the Mask; and he now openly assumes the Character, & copies the Manners of a Military Tyrant. His Treatment of Mr. Stockton is, to the last Degree shocking and inhuman, if Report is to be depended upon; and the Congress have so far paid Attention to it, that they have thought proper to direct Genl. Washington to make Enquiry into the Matter.(1)  Your Favour of the 3d inst. I recd. yesterday at two O'Clock in the Afternoon, and this morning laid it before Congress, who approve highly of your sending the Information it contains and are infinitely anxious to hear the Event. It is now one O'Clock P.M. and no Express as yet arrived; a Circumstance, which, in my opinion, augurs well. I have the Honour to be, with Sentiments of Esteem, Sir, your most obed. & very hble Servt.  John Hancock Presidt. [P.S.] Please to order the Letters Inclos'd to be deliver'd. You shall always have exact Copies of the Resolves which I send to the General, you have them now Inclos'd.(2) JANUARY 6, 1777  Jany.7th. We have an imperfect Acct. by the Post of the Engagement at Trenton-and are anxiously waiting for Particulars. In Hopes of receiving them, I have detained the Express till this Morning.  The Resolution sent you some time ago respectg the Magazine at York, is superceeded by the subsequent Resolve ordering one at Carlile.(3)  ""

  Sir, Baltimore Jany. 6th. 1777 The enclosed Resolves, which I have the Honour of transmitting, call for your immediate Attention; and I am to request you will take Measures in Pursuance thereof, as soon as possible.(1) Genl. Lee's Situation seems to to be extremely dangerous and critical; and from Genl. Howe's Behaviour to him, it is highly probable, he will be brought to a Trial for Desertion. Genl. Lee, it is said, by Mr. Eustace his Aid de Camp, having addressed two Letters to Genl. Howe, received them both back again unopened, and enclosed under a Cover directed to Lieutenant Colo. Lee. I hope the Flag which Congress ordered to be sent to make Enquiry into the Manner in which he is treated, has been dispatched, and a Remonstrance in Consequence of it, should the Information you have received of his Treatment, have rendered that Step necessary.  You will please to propose an Exchange of the six Hessian Field officers for him, & at the same Time make Enquiry whether the Report which Congress have heard of Mr. Stockton's being confined in a Common Jail by the Enemy, has any Truth in it, or not.(2)  By a Letter which Congress yesterday received from Mr. Morris we are informed that Genl. Cadwallader, with the Troops under him, had joined your Army-that the Enemy were at Trenton-- that the two Armies were divided only by a Creek, and that a General Engagement was hourly expected. In the mean Time, Congress are infinitely anxious to hear the Event; and humbly hope, that Victory has declared in Favour of those, whose sacred Cause should inspire them with Ardour on every solemn appeal to that Being, who hateth all Injustice, Tyranny, and oppression. I have the Honour to be, with every Sentiment of Esteem & Respect, Sir, your most obed. & very hble Servt. John Hancock Presidt  P.S. If the Desire of Congress to procure Genl. Lee's Exchange cannot be effected, and the Enemy, preferring the Gratification of Revenge to the  JANUARY 6, 1777  Civility they owe their Hessian Auxiliaries, determine to keep or to abuse him, it will be very agreeable to Congress that their Determination, with the enclosed Resolve, be made known to the Hessians as fully as possible. To secure Genl. Lee as effectually as may be from personal Insult & Injury, Congress have come to the present Resolution; (3) which you, Sir, are desired to convey to Genl. Howe with all convenient Dispatch.(4) It will be very agreeable to Congress that the Hessian Field Officer intended to be exchanged for Colo. Ethan Allen be sent to notify it to Genl. Howe, taking his Parole to return in a fixt Time, if Colo. Allen is not returned in his Place. It will fall within the Wish of Congress if Colo. Rohl, or one of the Hessian Officers, should be also sent with the Flag proposing the Exchange of Genl. Lee; but the propriety of it is submitted to you.  Jany. 7th. We have had an imperfect Acct. of the Engagement at Trenton, and anxiously wait for further Particulars. It was in Hopes of receiving them that I detained the Express till this Morning.  ""

  Dear Sir Philada. Jany 6th. 1777 I am favoured with yours of the 2d Inst and had much joy indeed, when I found the Lexington was arrived, because She wou'd be a mischievous Enemy, altho a very good Friend in proper hands.  I have directed the Captain & Officers to proceed down to Baltimore immediately judging they will be wanted in fitting her out again. Cap Hallock can also distinguish the Goods that are for Account of the Public from those on Other Account. I thank You for the promised care of those that are for me which I suppose to be the property of Mr. Ceronio at the Cape. I wou'd have them delivered to Mr. David Stewart to whom I give orders respecting them. Capt Hallock & his Officers are under parole and JANUARY 6, 1777  I judge the Capt of the Pearle wou'd agree to release them from that Parole on giving him back his midshipmen and Seamen from the Lexington, if this is approved I will send onboard the Roebuck & propose it [to] Capt Hamond from whom I received a polite letter, copy whereof I transmit to Congress.(1) The Sloop Race Horse (Prize to the Andrew Doria) is now come in, I mentioned in a letter to Congress sometime since a desire to fit this Vessell out in the Service & I wish you wou'd procure such an order & that Lieut Dun whose birthright it is, be appointed to Command her, he is the oldest Lieutt in the Service & Capt Biddle & Capt Isaiah Robinson with whom he sailed give him the Character of a good Officer. This Prize being an armed & Commissioned Vessell of War belonging to King George, the Officers & Seamen of the Andw Doria are entitled the whole as also to a Bounty on the Guns & Men which I will see to have justly settled and if the Congress order the Sloop to be fitted I will order the purchase of her when Condemned. No Tidings of the Sachem yet. I fear she will not escape the Enemy for they are very thick on our Coast & have already taken several good Cargoes from us. They are so posted that Capt Biddle cannot possibly get past them and as this place seems now pretty secure I am not so anxious for him to run the Risque, as formerly, but had they come here with the British Army I was determined to have made a bold attempt to push out every Vessell we had here & so given them the only chance that was left. However we shall now get time to finish the whole whenever our Tradesmen return but at present we cannot go on for want of them and I have sent the Boats of our whole Fleet up the River to be ready to assist our army in Crossing the River shou'd any misfortune happen them. I wish most sincerely that our Tradesmen was [here?], we might finish the Two Galleys & send them [to] molest the Roebuck & her Companions in the Bay, however as we cannot perform all we wish let us do what we can & when Genl. Howe is got the better of, we will turn our thoughts again to Marine affairs.  At present the Land Service affords us ample employment & will do so untill something decissive happens. One of my letters to Congress wou'd inform you when Mr. Smith returned & the success he met on opening his Office, but you must know I prevailed on two Gentn that were going to N England with Considerable Sums of money to give Mr Smith the money & take Loan Office Certificates as this wou'd put the thing in motion, and to prevent their being disappointed I gave them letters to the Continental Agents requesting their assistance in procuring these Gentn money for those notes whenever they might want it.(2) I finally promised if they cou'd not succeed in getting money in that Country for the Certificates that I wou'd send it to them from here. The rest I got People to lend and as I find some People who have money & wou'd lend it dont choose to have their names appear as lenders, I will take the Certificates   in my name & then pass them for their money, [. . .] my Dr Sir I will promote this business by all means in my power. I am perfectly satisfyed to have Alderman Lee joined with my Brother in the Continental business being convinced it will promote the Public good but at the same time such Commission or Compensation shou'd be allowed as will be sufficient for two instead of one, and I am confident they will both earn what they are to receive. The quantity of Tobo we shou'd ship to France ought to have no limit & sorry I am that the Vigilance of our Enemies, the Scarcity of Ships & Seamen with many other Causes keeps us from making the necessary progress, but our difficulties in this respect are almost insurmountable. I think we shall be in debt in every quarter, We must owe money in Martinico, St Eustatia & Cape Francois and I wish to remit to these places instantly if possible. We must be heavily in debt in old France if Mr Deane succeeds & whether he does or not we shall otherways be in debt if the Goods ordered are shipped. As things are now Circumstanced the Chance of getting out Merchant ships is against us, but I wou'd propose sending the Lexington & all our small Cruizers into the West Indias with orders to Carry their Prizes into the French Islands & send proper Powers to Mr Bingham &c to sell these in all cases that are clearly within the Laws of Congress, and in all probability these vessels will pay of your Debts & provide fresh Funds for further importations. If you approve of this Idea get the Congress to grant Mr Bingham a Commission or to empower the Marine Committee to give him instructions suited thereto, it may be very usefull & cannot hurt us in any shape.  I am now at the 7th & have recd the letter from the Secret Committee of the 4th and Congratulate you on the safe arrival of Capt Welsh, whom I had given up as taken by the Enemy. Capt Vicary who sailed with him is carried into New York. I am called upon by all the agents I have employed in the purchase of Tobacco for more money and must send it to them, but I think it is much better it shou'd be sent from Baltimore than that I shou'd send it from hence where money is so much wanted & daily called for, the purchase is considerable & really amounts to a great deal of Money and if we can but get the Goods to Market which in due time I hope we shall, it will make our affairs easy. As I judge it will be too troublesome to the Committee to divide this money amongst my Correspondents I propose sending down an Order in favour of Mr David Stewart & then I will give him directions to send by express the Sums necessary to each & I immagine it will require 80 to 100,000 Dollars to compleat the orders I have given them at different times which amot to several thousand hhds of Tobo. the particulars of which I cannot ascertain here as my papers are out of Town. I will write to the Secret Committee on this Subject when I draw the bill & am in haste, Dr Sir, Your Obedt hble servt. Robt Morris JANUARY 7, 1777  ""

The Measures that have been taken to prevent the Enemy from penetrating the Country, and for expelling them from our State give Me vast Satisfaction.

I therefore repeat part of that letter which is to desire you to send two vessels of 60 and 80 tons each to this place for iron and flour addresed to Samuel and Robt. Purviance. The iron will be wanted for the ship and the inhabitants will be glad of all the flour that can be spared from the public service. You have liberty to send in each vessel to the amount of 3000 dollars on the public acct in such articles as will best suit this market of which you may form a judgment by the price current enclosed and please to send me one Quintal best dun fish in each vessel. I believe a few Quls. of fish of an inferior quality for sale would do very well as there is none to be purchased here. By the same conveyance and under the same date of my last you'll receive a letter from the Secret Committee desiring you to purchase a ship and load her for France with masts and such other articles as you can procure suitable for that market, also that you charter two small vessels provided you can procure suitable cargoes for St Peters Newfoundland for the purpose of procuring woolen and linen goods for soldier's clothing and canvas for tents. If this letter comes first to hand you'll immediately set about this business as no time should be lost. My last inclosed you an account of a successful attack at Trenton on the 26th ulto since which our army have been vastly increased by the Militia and some regular Troops. The last authentic accounts are that the enemy's main body were advanced to Trenton and our's on this side Trenton bridge preparing for a general attack, a very heavy firing was heard the next morning being the 3d inst so that no doubt some great event has taken place before this hour, indeed some letters from Philadelphia say that the enemy are retreating and our people pursuing and have got as far as Princeton. However, an express is hourly expected, so I may have the pleasure of closing this with some very agreeable intelligence, but as the scene of action is between us it's probable you'll have earlier intelligence than I can give. This year my friend is big with mighty events, nothing less than the fate of America depends on the virtue of her sons, and if they have not virtue enough to support the most glorious cause that ever human beings were engaged in, they don't deserve the blessings of Freedom.

  Dear Sir, Baltimore Jany 8th 1777 I have several times referrd you to a Hint which I gave you in a Letter not long ago, and which I have not thought it prudent to repeat, lest by an Accident my Letter should be intercepted.(1) I have still the same opinion of the Importance of this Affair; but having conversd with General Gates who is now in this Town, upon that and other Matters, we have concluded upon a more sure Way of effecting it, than that which I proposed to you. I wish therefore, if you have already communicated it to any of our Friends, you would injoyn them to close Secrecy, and that it may be even forgot by them till the Event of it shall be known to the World.  I am much pleasd to find that the New England Troops have so great a Share in the Honor of the late Action at Trenton. Genl Gates speaks very highly of the Militia you sent him the last Fall. He applauds greatly their Zeal for the Cause, and particularly their Readiness to tarry in the Service after the Expiration of the Term of their Inlistments in November, and he tells me he gave them an honorable Discharge. I have not the Pleasure of knowing Genl Brickett, but he mentions him to me as a worthy good officer.  We have further good Accounts from our Army, which are credited although they are not yet authenticated. I verily beleive that the Incursion of the Enemy into the Jerseys will in the Event be much to our Advantage, and that this Campaign will end gloriously on our side. I never will be sanguine in my Expectation, for I know the Events of War are uncertain; but there seems to be an enterprizing Spirit in our Army which I have long wishd to see, and without which we may not expect to do great Things. The same enterprizing Spirit also takes Place here. We have done Things which I would not have flattered myself with the least Hope of doing a Month ago. This Express will carry to the Council a Resolution which I presume will be communicated to you of Course.(2) Hereafter I will give you a very particular and good Reason why it is not communicated to you in this Letter.  We understand that by the Enemies Treatment of General Lee there is a Design to try him as a deserting officer and take away his Life. Congress have directed General Washington to acquaint General Howe, that if this is his Intention, five of the Hessian Feild Officers now in our Hands together with Lt. Colo Campbel will be detaind and sacrificed as an atonement for his Blood, should the Matter be carried to that Extremity; and this Resolution will most undoubtedly for my opinion be executed in full Fate.

The British Forces it is said Crossed the Rariton on Saturday Night & the Hessians  JANUARY 8, 1777  were to follow on Sunday morning. We observe the General is extreamly cautious in his letters & gives only such intelligence as he is pretty certain of, there are others in his Army, that write with less restraint & say that in a few days the Jersey's will be cleared of the Enemy, that Genl Heath & Genl. McDougal were expected to join our Army very speedily with considerable reinforcements, and it is reported that Genl McDougal has Killed & taken prisoners sixty Waldeckers near Newark. Genl Putnam is also on his march after them & we hear he is considerably reinforced by New Jersey Militia. Colo Fleming is arrived here with about 200 of the 9th Virginia Regiment the remainder he expects this Night. We shall order them Cloathing & money to discharge their arrearages & then to march up for the army. Nothing further occurs at this time except that we are always, sir, Your obedt hble servts,  Robt Morris  Geo Clymer Geo Walton P.S. The enclosed Note from the President of the Council of Safety recommends Mr. Lewis Pintard of New York as a proper person to reside there as agent for Prisoners & We believe he is so.  ""

  Dear sir Baltimore Jany 8th. 1777  Since you left Philadelphia many important Events have taken place in the Council as well as the Field; those that are publick you are undoubtedly informed of, the others I shall hint as they occur to my Mind.  Congress have ordered arms & Equipage for 3000 Horse & 150 brass Field pieces to be imported without Delay. The General to expedite Business is invested with Great Powers, which are to continue six Months unless sooner revoked by Congress, & are confined to the person of G. Washington; amongst other Things he is to raise, establish, & appoint the Officers for 3000 light Horse & as many of the Train; to officer &r raise sixteen new Batalions, which in Addition to 94 before ordered make 110 of Infantry; wherever he is, to take whatever he wants for the Use of the Army, from those Who shall refuse to supply him for continental Currency, & profer the same, to the Amount of the apprized Value of the Goods taken; to displace any officers under the rank of Brigadier & to fill up their places, as well of officers in other Departments. Three Magazines of military stores are to be provided, in Virginia, Lancaster in Pennsylvania, & Brookfield in Massachusetts. A Committee is JANUARY 8, 1777  appointed to prepare a Report for regulating the Business of the Boards of War, Commerce, Admiralty, Treasury, Ordnance & Indian Affairs, & for conducting them by Gentlemen not Members of Congress. I wish to have your Sentiments fully on each of these six Departments with an Arrangement of the several officers & their respective Powers. Further the Treaty is revised & Applications are made to [France] (1) for the Loan of two Millions Sterling in Specie & a supply of 100,000 stands of Arms; Commissioners are to be sent to the Courts of Madrid, Prussia, Vienna & Tuscany; Doctor [Franklin] to the first The Commissioners are instructed to inform their respective Courts, that Congress are informed of the insidious & artful Designs of the Court of G Britain to represent them, & the Inhabitants of these States as having an Inclination to return again to the Domination of his Britannic Majesty, & that it is the Determination of both the Government & People at every Event to maintain their Independence. The Commissioners at the Courts of [France] & [Spain] are to use every Means in their power to procure a Declaration of War against G. B. & as an Inducement to propose to the first, that all the Trade between these States and W I Islands shall be carryed on in [French] & American Vessels: to offer provisions to the Amount of 2,000,000 of Dollars & six Frigates of not less than 24 Guns each, at the Expence of the United States for carrying on Expeditions for reducing to the Government of [France] the British West India Islands (& all other Assistance in our power as good & faithful Allies;) to propose by the united arms of [France] & the States to deprive G Britain of any share in the Cod fishery by reducing Nova Scotia, Newfoundland & Cape Breton, & when the same shall be accomplished it is further proposed that the Fishery shall be enjoyed by [France] and the united States to the Exclusion of all other Nations whatever, Newfoundland to be divided between [France] & the States & [Breton?] annexed to the States. The Commissioner at the Court of M[adrid] as an Inducement for declaring war are to propose to his C[hristian] Majesty the assistance of the States to reduce the Town & Harbour of Pensacola, & annex the same to his Territory & Government; & if the King of Portugal has caused any of our Vessels to be confiscated, to engage in behalf of the States that War shall be declared against the sd King, if the Measure is approved & will be supported by both the Courts before hinted. All the Commissioners are to sollicit the Interpositions of the several Courts for preventing further Embarkations of Foreign Troops to America & recalling such as are now here.(2) General Washington is to offer six of the Hessian field Officers in Exchange for General Lee, & if General Howe refuses this, to inform him, that these with a favorite British Officer in our Custody shall share the same Fate as the General; of whose Sincerity by the by I think there is now no Reason to doubt. This Resolution will at all Events be carryed into Execution, if I can form any Judgment of the Firmness of Congress, for the General not being in the actual Service of G Britain  JANUARY 8 1777  cannot be considered as they are desirous of representing him, a Deserter from their Army, he had doubtless a Right to give up a pension allowed him for Services heretofore performed, & having done this evidently ceases to be a servant of or connected with the Crown & could not as an officer be called to Duty; he had therefore as good a Right to engage in the Service as any Inhabitant of these States & will be so considered by Congress. Upon this Head I shall be also glad to have your opinion, since the Consequence may be a War without Quarter & the greatest Care should be taken to proceed on Justifiable principles which I think We are in this Case evidently pursuing.(3)  The Reduction of Fort Cumberland & Destruction of the Dock Yard & Magazines at Halifax are objects of great Importance; & if Matters are well conducted, they appear to me to be feasible. The Gentleman wch You sent to Mr. Adams has been before Congress, & they have come to a Resolution That the Council of Massachusetts B. be impowered to attend to the Situation of the Enemy in that Quarter & when they are of Opinion that an advantageous Attack can be made, to raise, subsist, officer & pay a Body of Men not exceeding 3000 for carrying on the Expedition in the Course of the Winter or early in the Spring, to prepare & convey to any parts of the eastern Counties of Massachusetts Sufficient Magazines of military & other Stores, & to draw on Congress for Money for these purposes (4) General Gates is here & is well acquainted with Mr. Allen's Father as well as himself, the former by Mr. Allen's Account is a half pay officer, he himself was a Member of the Assembly & says he left the province to avoid taking the Oath of Allegiance. His Wife, Family & Effects are now in Nova Scotia, & therefore it may be necessary to be on our Guard, & take other Measures to gain Intelligence least We be decoyed into a military Trap!, which an Enemy experienced in the Arts of War will be continually attempting. You will undoubtedly see some Members of the Council & push the Matter as far as may be prudent; It is supposed that the Militia of the eastern Counties wch cannot be brot into the Field will readily engage for 3 or 4 Months to accomplish this plan, that if the Information of Mr. Allen \""that the Enemy there are not above 800 Strong\"" should be confirmed, the Matter can be conducted with such Secrecy as to take the Enemy by Surprize, that if they have Intelligence of our Intentions after Orders arrive in the eastern Country to embody the Men, Time will not admit of their receiving Reinforcements before the Expedition is carryed thro, that Stores can be conveyed without any suspicion of this Kind previous to the Order for raising the Levies, by pretexts which Massachusetts Inhabitants are dexterous to fabricate & that General Washington who has a Copy of the Resolve will furnish a General if wanted.  Congress since their Removal from Philadelphia are exceedingly spirited & united; I was against leaving it but hope they will never return to that Sepulchre of Genius & Enterprize. The Nabob S & N Carolina continue to be Antipodes to the rest, & to sharpen Steel whetstones are necessary. I  think the Intention of the Enemy next Campaign is to press N England in every quarter, & that by proper Exertions they will be foiled with their intended Reinforcements. The Support of the Credit of our Money is the only Difficulty that rests on my Mind, & I doubt not it will be soon removed. Pray communicate to the Speaker, Major Hawley & Colo. Orne with my best Respects such parts of the Letter (if Opportunity offers) as You shall think proper & believe me to be sir your assured Friend & hum sert, E Gerry  P.S. We are in Expectation of important Intelligence from the Jersies, should our Arms be successful we shall push on this Side for driving the Enemy from N York; pray follow the Blow from N England & press them by the Way of Kings Bridge With your new Levies. I doubt not they will be stirred at Newport. Doctors Morgan & Stringer are dismissed from the Service in Consequence of the Clamours of the people, & their Misconduct.  ""

This Gentleman it seems is a Member of the Congress in Georgia, and under that Character, is secretly supporting by every Act in his Power, the Designs of the British King & Parliament agt. us.(1)  The United States of America have hitherto suffered extremely from the Misrepresentation of their Enemies; but much more from the Baseness and Perfidy of their pretended Friends. I have it therefore in Command from Congress to request that you will cause the said George McIntosh to be immediately apprehended, and take every other Step in this Matter, which shall appear to you to be necessary for the Safety of the United States of America.

  Dear Sir, Baltimore Jany 8th. 1777 Your two favor of the 29th ulto. and 2d Inst.(1) I have had several Days and should have answer'd them sooner, but have been very unwell ever since Friday last. I have taken my last Dose I hope to Day and that I shall be about again to-morrow; I do not know that I have been so vex'd with my self for some time, as I am for not informing you that the secret Come. of Cor[respondenc]e has bot a fast sailing vessel which is now ready to sail for Nantes, and is only detained for a Certain acct of our Generals success. Faulty as I am, you must give me some little Credt. when I tell you it proceeded from my not doubting your geting the Information from  JANUARY 8, 1777  Picture of The Henry Fite House JANUARY 8, 1777 57 the Secret Comme who are not able to answer the Letters they recd on the subject of trade without your assistance. They have Receivd Volumes from Pliarne & Compy. who must think strangely of you if they do not get satisfactory answers to them, which I am sure they will not do, as the answer I [was?] deliver'd could not contain the tenth part of it, which lead to the enquiry whether you had been inform'd of the Vessels going or not. Besides the dispatches that will go by the above Schooner, we have others prepared for Buchanans ship which it is expected will sail to day, or tomorrow. We have not heard a Word of Pirates on this Coast, if any appear you shall most assuredly be advised as soon as the acct reaches us. I will forward the money to Ben when you shall please to order it, and I get a good oppy.(2) I fancy he will soon want it, as he writes me Tobacco rises fast, he has been oblig'd to get up as high as 20/ for some fine Crops, driven to it by Pleasants, who is buy[ing] all the good he can lay his hands on at that price, for the Torey Quakers in your Town.  I wish Congress may remove back with all my Heart, for I am most cursedly Vex'd with this Place, indeed I had like to have been so with Philada. Nothing but the little circle of acquaintance I had there prevented it but this tryal of Baltimore will make me (if possible) set a much greater Value on them but on the Town most certainly, however I am told the Yankeys are against it, if so we go not, they Rule as absolutly as the Grand Turk dos in his own Dominions. I could give you an instance of it, but it must not be committed to Paper.  The arms were order'd to the head of Elk for two Reasons, one that they might be in a place of Safety, the other that the Virga Regiments might be sure of good arms. They are to leave their own behind them, and expect to be furnish'd at that place and I know they had rather carry them with them and appear in Character, than go like no body knows who, however if they get them I am content, but I doubt their doing it, as I see Towers has deliver'd them all to the Council of Safety. God grant that Philada may be a place of safety, I think it will, if the Life of our worthy General is preserved, but I tremble for him, every officer complains of his Exposing himself too much. Your Letter to the President wch came to hand yesterday releived us from great anxiety, there were such number P[urvianc]e and R[ush] Lies circuiated that we knew not what to think, particularly as we had not a Word from you. We are now in high Spirits waiting for a Confirmation of what you write, with Glorious additions, but know my Dear Sir I have my moments of Fear, dispell them quickly I beg of you. I never was better pleased than to find your People turning out as they do, I wish a little Spark could be sent here. All is either Confusion or Languor, or what may be worse. The Colony has never yet been represented. How could the man I Loved and Respected turn Rascal, I knew his Principles of Politics were not quite right, but I expected his objections would be soon done away, and that he  would be again returned to us, but alass I have been totally mistaken in him, he was ever mark'd, you know I must mean A.A.(3)  O that if of yours, if we are but Honest in Publick Councils & can look at the Paragraph mark'd thus X and find it answered.  I most sincerely thank you for your kind wishes to see me again at the Hills, I generally appropriate some moments on Sunday to that Place let me be where I will, but in this infernal Sink I scarcely think of any thing else, there is not even a Tavern that we can Ride to for Exercise and amusement within 15 miles of the Place, I mean such as a Gentn can dine in with Comfort. My Compliments to Walton. I have Recd his two Favors (4) and would write to him but really have nothing to say that can either give him pleasure or amusement. I have a wish that his Country was Represented, but alass it is not, you may as soon change the Devil into an angel of Light as a C-t man into any thing else. He should not if I could help it stay where he is if he could be of Service here, but as he can not I leave him to assist you and to Toy away a Leasure Hour now and then with his Fille de Joy.  I am much oblig'd to my Friend Mease for the Sugar and for geting the Chairs, how we shall get them I know not without he can prevail on his Good Friend Jonathan Mifflin to take them on board one of his Shallops. I am, Dr Sir, your affect Hble Servt, Benj Harrison  P.S. Ben seems to wish himself clear of his Place. Will his Resigning it be any Prejudice to his Commission Business; if not I shall approve of his doing it, he will be able to attend the latter more closely.

3034,dg00649,1777,Robert Morris to Silas Deane,"""Robert Morris to Silas Deane
  January 8, 1777 I am now arrived at the 8th of January 1777 without having had any oportunity of dispatching this Letter, as there are constantly 6 or 8 sail of the Enemies ships cruising in our Bay and off the Capes where they have taken many of our inward bound vessells & effectually blocked up all those we have in this Port. This detention affords me the pleasure of giving you a detail of what has passed since the 20 Decr. when the above was written & thank God the picture will be more pleasing to you as the  JANUARY 8, 1777  Reality has been to me. You'll observe in my former narative I left the Enemy posted at all the little Towns & Villages in New Jersey that afforded them good quarters, ready however to form an attack agst this place whenever the Ice should afford them a Bridge across Delaware. I then gave it as my opinion, this was a favorable disposition to attack them in. It seems Genl. Washington thought so too & meditated a heavy blow agst. them-such it would have proved had this plan Succeeded intirely & such has proved that part in which he did succeed. Orders were given to Genl Cadwallader (posted at Bristol with this City's associations) to Genl. Ewing with a body posted at Trenton Ferry, to cross Delaware on Christmas night when Genl. Washington himself crossed about 9 miles above Trenton with about 2400 & instantly marched them down for this place in two Divisions by different Roads. His design was to Surprise the Garison in this place before daylight, but the weather being extremely Cold, the Ice in Delaware retarded his boats & they did not reach the Scene of action untill 8 oClock but as they were attended by a most severe No. East Storm of hail, Rain, Snow & wind, the Surprize was compleat. There was 4 Regimts of Hessians commanded by Colonel Rholl stationed here. Their advance guards made some Resistance to our advance parties & alarmed the main body time enough for about 3 or 400 & 70 Light horse that were here also to get over Trenton Bridge & make off. The remainder had drawn up, but both Divisions of our army coming on them at the same time by different Roads they Surrendered, there was 918 Prisoners that thus Surrendered with the Colours of the 4 Regimts., 6 field pieces and Considerable Bagage & stores, those that made off by way of the Bridge would have been taken by Genl. Erwing could he have Crossed at the Ferry, but the Ice made so fast & that place is so dificult when there is Ice that it was not possible as he did all that Men could do to get over, therefore some, but not the whole of the flying party did escape, many have been taken since & our Prisoners from that Expedition amounts to 1100 or 1200. Colonel Rholl died of his wounds & some other officers were Killed with about 40 privates, we did not lose a Man & had only Capn. Washington & two Privates wounded. General Cadwallader got over about 1000 men of his party but the Ice made so fast on him that he could not get over the artillery nor the Remainder of his Force & was obliged to bring back those that had Crossed. His object was to have Surprized the Posts at Mount Holly & then to have marched up the River whilst Genl. Washington marched down that they might Surround all the Troops Cantoned at Burlington, Bordentown & their Vicinity. This plan was well Laid & had not the Ice prevented would have been well Executed. Genl Washington finding those material parts frustrated & knowing the Enemy's Strength to be vastly superior to that with him at Trentown recrossed Delaware & brought off the Hessian Prisoners, field pieces, Stores &ca. However he  found himself in a few Days reinforced with a good many of the Militia & determined to follow up the Blow he had struck-he crossed again to Trenton, ordered Genl Cadwallader to Cross at Bristol and directed Genl. Putnam to forward from this Place all the associators, Militia & others troops that he could muster. The Enemy were exceedingly alarmed by what had been done to Trenton & broke up their Quarters in all the parts of the Jerseys below that place, marching with precipitation back in the Country towards South Amboy, but at Cranbery they Received orders & filed off towards Brunswick. During this Time General Howe sent all the reinforcements he could from New York & whilst Genl. Washington was collecting his whole force at Trenton [the] Enemy were doing the same at Brunswick. On [...] the 2d Instant our Army was Colected and had Concerted some plan of operations when Intelligence was brought that the Enemies Main Body were on their March [to] attack them at Trenton. Genl. Washington [dispatched] a Brigade under Ld Stirling to amuse them & in [. . .] he drew the whole army (that Brigadier excepted) [over] the Bridge of Trenton & took post on the Heights [on] this Side the Creek that runs through that Place. [He] posted his artillery advantageously and waited the Return of Lord Stirling's Brigade, which met [the] Enemy & kept up a warm fire against them [still] retreating from about one oClock untill Sunsett [when] they entered & Marched through Trenton. The [Enemy] pushed them very hard & Killed near 100 of our [men] at the Bridge which they attempted to Cross, but [so soon] as our own people were over the Compliment was [. . .] return and equal, if not a greater slaughter, made [amongst] them. They were Broke & retired, each army then mounted their Guards within 100 yards of each other [and] a bloody battle was expected the next day. Our people possessed that part of the Town where the small number of houses stand & they had not Covering sufficient, therefore they made large fires to [keep them] Warm for the weather was severely Cold & they [very bad]ly cloathed. Genl Washington had received inteligence of] the Enemies numbers & found them Superior to his own. [They] consisted of regular troops, under good Discipline, well Cloathed & excellently armed, His, were chiefly Militia, badly armed, III provided with Cloathing & accoutrements, under no dissipline & very few of them had ever Seen a Gun fired in Anger, behold him Now [in] this most Critical situation and Consider the Conseq[uences of] a Genl action. The only regular Troops he had with him had a right to go off because the Terms of their Inlistment expired the day before, if those departed the Militia would have been dishartened & mouldered away [to no]thing and had that happened it would be impossible ever to [get] them together again. If he gave battle or waited to be [attack]ed he could not promise himself the Least Chance of Success, being beaten his army would instantly disperse and leave this Province at the mercy of the Enemy. The Boats with [which] he Crossed   Delaware were above Trenton on the Pennsylvania Side and it was Impossible to Cross. If he [retre]ated towards Borden Town the Enemy were invited to follow & his Raw Troops would be totally dispirited, whereas at this time every man thought himself a Caesar. Thus surrounded with dificulties and dangers attended with Consequences terrible to think of, He determined to strike a bold Stroke that might disconcert the Enemy and gain him time to place himself in a better posture. He knew there was at Prince [Town] a party of not more than 2000 men with Cloathing, [stores] & bagage, that at Brunswick was the Chief of [their] Stores & Bagage but badly guarded. He Called a [Council] of the Genl officers, told them his Situation and proposed decamping and by a forced march thro the woods round Trenton to Surprize Prince Town in the morning. This was agreed to and orders given accordingly. About 12 oClock the whole army was in Motion not knowing where they were going and a guard of about 500 Men left at the Bridge, totally ignorant of this movement (except the Commanding officers) the Fires had all been made up afresh before the march & the intire bagage of the Army sent off for Burlington so that few of [the] Soldiers took with them even their Blankets. The [Enemy] never discovered this Movement nor did our own Guards [at] the Bridge untill the morning, when our army had passed Maidenhead on their March to Princetown some Troops posted at Maidenhead saw them & dispatched advices to Princetown & preparations were made for receiving us. About a Mile & a half on this side that place the Enemy had taken post very advantageously, consisting of three Regimts of British, some broken Hessians & highlanders & a small party of Light horse, a small action ensued between them & our advanced Party, in which both sides exemplified great Bravery but the Enemy were forced to give way to Superior Numbers, with the Loss of 50 or 60 Killed, as many wounded and 140 prisoners. Our Army pushed on took possession of Prince Town with some field pieces, 100 oxen, a number of sheep, a quantity of blankets, Bagage & stores, Killed here some more of the Enemy & made more prisoners. Their whole loss on this occasion suposed to amount to about 600 in killed, wounded & prisoners. The general's original design was to Surprize Brunswick also, but his troops were totally unfit either to undertake any new Exploit or to Sustain another action for a great part of the militia had been Constantly on a March for near 36 hours during which they had never eat, drank or slept in a manner to afford them the Least refreshment.  The enemy's army at Trenton under Command of Lord Cornwallis did not miss our army for some time as our guard at the Bridge gave 'em a Canonade before they went off, but when they found Genl Washington had decamped and heard the firing towards Prince Town [they] were in the utmost Consternation & immediately made hearty March after them, Genl. Washington knew they were Coming & not being in a Condition to  face them, [took] up some Bridges to impede their March, & [struck on] the one Side of Somerset Court House, where he halted [all night.] From thence he marched to a place called Pluckamise, thence to Morris Town where he was resting and refreshing his troops the 7th Instant for I am now at the 9th and have Just recd dispatches from him. Ld Cornwallis anxious for the Safety of Brunswick pushed for that place & now Genl. Howe is Collecting all his force that was scattered in New Jersey to that point General Washington at the same [time] will be reinforced as I Expect by Generals Heath & McDougal but [their] numbers I dont know. I think Genl Howe's [whole] force in New Jersey does not amount to more [than] 8000 men, he has lost in Killed, wounded and taken above 2000 since Christmass & our loss in atchieving this consists in Genl. Mercer dangerously wounded, Colonel Haslet & Potter killed a few other inferior off[icers], and these with all the Privates will not amount to 150 men. These Treats [feats] have turned the Scale. [The] Militia of this Place, Maryland & Jersey begin to turn out & think themselves good Soldiers but this winter Campaign is very severe on their being [. . .] and badly provided agst. the inclemency of the Season. They Know their Enemies are warmly cloathed and well provided, however they have stood it surprizingly [well]. Since the 25th the Eastern States are also turning out, [and?] seem bent on driving the Insurgents off Rhode Island, and it is also said they have a design to attack New York whilst we keep them employed in New Jersey. Thus you see the face of affairs is greatly changed since I began this Letter, but the Campaign is not yet finished. I wish it was, because Congress have now taken very spirited & effectual measures to render our Army and arms more formidable, by the extensive powers they have vested in Genl. Washington and I cannot but regret his want of Leisure to begin a Reformation that is extremely necessary. Indeed, they [have voted] him to raise & officer 16 Batons. of Infantry more than formerly ordered, also 3000 Light horses, a fine Corps of artillery & engineers &c &c. Thus whilst we have strength & are excerting [it], let France join us & she will be well seconded and suported, but if fresh importations of foreign cut throats are permitted to come over our Men will be wasted, our Finances exausted, and France lose the Glorious oportunity of assisting the opressed & of gaining the advantages of a Comerce that has [enriched] Great Brittain to a Degree that astonished [all] Europe. Measures are taking to reestablish the Credit of our Money which I doubt not will be attended with Success, but you must exert yourself to procure us timely aid in this virtuous struggle, in which we seek only to keep what belongs to us, [and] to maintain those rights which God gave, Great Britain long Confirmed but would now ingloriously rob us of.(1)  ""

  Dear David, Baltimore, Jan. 8, 1777.  Three days ago I received your favour of the 20th past, with pleasure. I must tell you a trifling circumstance. When I cast my eye on the back of it, I thought it was somebody that wrote very distinctly and neatly, and did not think of you, till I saw with satisfaction your name at the bottom. There are, however, still some small inaccuracies-be ambitious of improving every day.  Just about the time I received your letter, I had given to Col. Nayler letters for Mr. Smith and Fanny (1) and yourself, all wrapped in a parcel for Mr. Smith. In my letter to him, of a sheet of paper, I gave a very full and particular account of our flight from Princeton, and the situation of your mother as well as myself. She is at Pequea-I hope well, but I have not heard from that place since I left her. We carried nothing away of all our effects, but what could be carried upon one team. Benjamin Hawkins drove your mother in the old chair, and I rode the sorrel mare, and made John Graham drive the four young colts. This I write least the letter should miscarry, but have not time to repeat the whole detail. In the close of that letter, I had the pleasure of writing that General Washington had gone over the river at Trenton, surprised and taken a great number of Hessians. Since that time he has been in the Jerseys, and though we have not a letter directly from himself, yet letters from Philadelphia have made us believe that on Thursday night last he deceived the enemy at Trenton, made a forced march, met Lord Howe at Stonybrook, defeated him, took about 700 prisoners, and afterwards took Princeton, and is still pursuing the enemy towards Brunswick.(2) If before this letter is sent off a further account comes, you shall have it....(3) J.

  My dear Sir Baltimore Jany 9 1777 I have every Day for a Month past been anxiously expecting the Pleasure of seeing you here, but now begin to suspect you do not intend to give us your Assistance in Person. I shall therefore do all that lies in my Power to engage your epistolary Aid. You will by every Opportunity receive my JANUARY 9, 1777  Letters, and, I dare say, you will be so civil to me as to answer at least some of them.  I have given our Friend Warren, in one of my Letters to him, the best Reason I could for the sudden Removal of Congress to this Place.(1) Possibly he may have communicated it to you. I confess it was not agreable to my Mind; but I have since alterd my Opinion, because we have done more important Business in three Weeks than we had done, and I believe, should have done, at Philadelphia, in six Months. As you are a Member of Congress, you have a Right to know all that has been done; but I dare not commit it to Paper, at a Time when the safe Carriage of Letters is become so precarious. One thing I am very sollicitous to inform you, because I know it will give you great Satisfaction. If you recollect our Conversation at New Haven, I fancy you will understand me, when I tell you, that to one Place we have added four, and increasd the Number of Persons from three to six.(2) I hate this dark mysterious Manner of writing, but Necessity requires it.  You have heard of the Captivity of General Lee. Congress have directed Genl Washington to offer six Hessian Field officers in Exchange for him. It is suspected that the Enemy chuse to consider him as a Deserter, bring him to Trial in a Court Martial & take his Life. Assurances are orderd to be given to General Howe, that five of those officers together with Lt Colo Campbel will be detaind, and all of them receive the same Measure that shall be meted to him. This Resolution will most certainly be executed.  We have this Day passd a Recommendation to the Council of Massachusetts Bay of a very important Nature. It will be sent by this Express to the Council, to whom I refer you for a Perusal of it.(3)  Our Affairs in France and Spain wear a promising Aspect, and we have taken Measures to put them on a respectable Footing in other Parts of Europe; & I flatter myself too much if we do not succeed.  The Progress of the Enemy thro' the Jerseys has chagrind me beyond Measure, but I think we shall reap the Advantage in the End. We have already beat a Part of their Army at Trenton, and the inclosd Paper will give you a farther Account which we credit, though not yet authenticated. The late Behavior of the People of Jersey was owing to some of their leading Men, who instead of directing & animating, most shamefully deserted them. When they found a Leader in the brave Colo Ford, they followd him with Alacrity. They have been treated with savage Barbarity by the Hessians, but, I believe, more so by Britains. After they have been most inhumanly used in their Persons, without Regard to Sex or Age, and plundered of all they had without the least Compensation, Lord Howe and his Brother (now Sir William Knight of the Bath) have condescended to offer them Protections for the free Enjoyment of their Effects.   You have seen the Power with which General Washington is vested for a limitted Time. Congress is very attentive to the Northern Army, and Care is taking effectually to supply it with every thing necessary this Winter for the next Campaign. General Gates is here. How shall we make him the Head of that Army?  We are about establishing Boards of War, Ordnance, Navy and Treasury, with a Chamber of Commerce, each of them to consist of Gentlemen who are not Members of Congress. By these Means I hope our Business will be done more systematically, speedily, & effectually.(4)  Great and heavy Complaints have been made of Abuse in the Director Generals Department in both our Armies. Some, I suppose, without Grounds, others with too much Reason. I have no Doubt but as soon as a Committee reports, which is expected this Day, both Morgan and Stringer will be removd, as I think they ought.  To the Eighty Eight Battalions orderd to be raisd, Sixteen are to be added, which with Six to be raisd out of the Continent at large will make one hundred & ten, besides three thousand horse, three Regiments of Artillery and a Company of Engineers. We may expect fifty or sixty thousand of the Enemy in June next. Their Design will still be to subdue the obstinate States of New England. It was the Intention that Carleton should winter in Albany, Howe in New York and Clinton at Rhode Island, that with Reinforcements in the Spring, they might be ready to attack New England on all sides. I hope every possible Method will be used to quicken the new Levies, and that the Fortifications in the Harbour of Boston will be in complete readiness. Much will depend upon our Diligence this Winter.  The Attention of Congress is also turnd to the Southward. Forts Pitt and Randolph are to be garrisond, and Provisions laid up for 2000 Men, Six Months. By the last Accounts from South Carolina we are informd, that late Arrivals have supplyd them with every thing necessary for their Defence.  I have written in great Haste, and have Time only to add that I am, with sincere Regards to your Lady and Family, very cordially, Your Friend, Samuel Adams  P.S. Dr Morgan and Dr Stringer are dismissd without any Reason assignd which Congress could of Right do, as they held their Places during Pleasure. The true Reason, as I take it, was the general Disgust and the Danger of the Loss of an army arising therefrom.  ""

  Gentlemen Baltimore 9th January 1777 Captain Hammond having been detained longer than we expected, furnishes us with an opportunity of giving you the information we have since our last received from the Army, thro a Committee of Congress left at Philadelphia; for we have yet had no regular accounts from General Washington.  On the 2d instant, General Washington having received information that the enemy were on their march to attack him at Trenton, ordered two brigades of militia to advance and annoy them on the road leading from Princeton to Trenton, who falling in with the enemy about 3 miles from the latter place, engaged them, but being overpower'd by numbers, made a retreating fight until they joined the main body who were drawn up on the heights west of a bridge that divides the village of Trenton nearly in two parts. The enemy attempting to force the bridge were repulsed with loss by a body of men with artillery placed there to receive them. In the mean time some batteries being opened on the heights soon drove the enemy from that part of the Town possessed by them. Thus the affair ended for that evening. But General Washington having received intelligence that Gen. Howe was in person coming up to join his army with a strong reenforcement, directing fires to be made on the heights to deceive the enemy, decampt at midnight and made a forced march in order to meet Mr. Howe and give him battle before he joined his main body. About 3 miles short of Prince Town, the van of our army fell in with 600 British Infantry strongly posted behind a fence, and upon a hill, with artillery. They were attacked, & after a smart engagement, routed, having lost 280 killed and taken prisoners; among whom, one Colonel, one Major, several Captains and subalterns were slain, and about 20 Officers made prisoner. The fugitives were pursued thro Princeton where our Army halted a while. In this affair 6 pieces of artillery with abundance of baggage fell into our hands. At Princeton, it was learnt that Gen. Howe was not with this party, but that he remained at Brunswick with 3 or 4 thousand men. There being a considerable force in the rear, and our Men greatly fatigued with their march, and their baggage chiefly behind (it having been sent to Burlington) the General proceeded to Sommerset Court house that evening, a little to the Westward of the road leading to Brunswick, and about 7 or 9 miles from that place. Here we understand he expected to be joined by a body of 1500 or 2000 fresh troops, and that his intention was to attack Mr. Howe in Brunswick. On Friday morning, when the enemy at Trenton missed our army, they returned towards Princeton, but it seems, they left 3000 Hessians behind them, who following afterwards, were so fatigued with travel, and want  JANUARY 9, 1777  of food, that numbers were left on the road, and were straggling about the country in threes and fours. Many were taken by the Country people and brought in prisoners, many came to Trenton and surrendered themselves. The militia of Jersey are rising generally, and it was thought few of these Hessians would get back again. This is the present state of our information, and we hourly expect a well authenticated account of the whole, and of much greater successes. We shall endeavor to give you the speediest account of what shall further come to our knowledge from good authority. The above relation is taken from a Gentleman who was in the action, and who the Committee write us, is a person of sense and honor. The General has been too much engaged to write, & we suppose waits the final issue.  We most earnestly wish you success in your negotiation, and are with perfect esteem, honorable Gentlemen, your most obedient and very humble servants,  Benja Harrison  Richard Henry Lee P.S. In the engagement near Princeton we lost 15 privates, one Colonel, and Brigadier Gen Mercer, a very good officer & a worthy Gentleman.  In secret Committee.  ""

  Dear sir Jany 9th 1777 We received your Lordships letter of last night (1) and have communicated the Contents to General Ewing who commands here at this time, also to the council of Safety,(2) and altho it seems to be our unanimous opinion that General Howe will not play such a desperate game as to push for this place under present circumstances, still it may be most prudent to act as if that were his design. Genl. Ewing will therefore give immediate orders to All the Troops that are in this city to march for Bristol from whence the Commanding officer will be directed to correspond with your Lordship, also with Genl. Washington & Genl. Putnam &c, and as more Troops come in they will be Sent forward. Here is the 9th Virginia Regiment commanded by Colo.

We shall be happy to hear that a Speedy recovery may enable you to take the Command of this Force to which every  JANUARY 9, 1777  addition shall be made that is possible. The Commissary will be ordered to forward Provision and Ammunition, but Cloathing and other Necessarys are so wasted and destroyed by Militia that all the Magazines of Europe would hardly keep them supplied.

  Sir Philada. Jany 9th. 1777  We have just received the dispatches from Congress delivered herewith to Colo. Hartley, & having received Copies of the Resolves of Congress therein enclosed to you, we cannot help saying they have been liberal in their offers to regain Genl Lee, and altho we have not only a high opinion of his merit & abilities as an Officer but also a personal regard for him, yet we are apt to think we shou'd have opposed these offers had we been in Congress, at least some of us are of that opinion. However this is not to the purpose at present. We observe that Congress direct you to propose an agreement whereby prisoners may be supplyed with provisions at the Expence or upon the Credit of the States. We recommended to Congress to appoint an Agent of their own to attend the Prisoners & see justice done them and to prevent their enlisting with the Enemy & if this is not done the plan will be incompleat, as we are inclined to believe our People suffer by the peculation of the Commissarys that have the care of them, & not by the allowance ordered by the Commander in Chief. We think such an agent might be admitted on each side, under parole not to give intelli- JANUARY 9, 1777  gence. We suppose the Report about Mr Stockton to be totally false but your Excellency will no doubt know that matter perfectly. As you will have Occasion to send in a Flag to Genl Howe we beg leave to suggest the propriety of writing to Lord Howe respecting the Ill usage our prisoners suffer onboard the Prison Ships in New York and particularly we cou'd wish his Lordship to be informed that the Officers & Seamen taken onboard British Merchant Ships have not been considered as prisoners of War in this place, but have always been left at liberty to dispose of themselves as they thought proper without restraint, and have very generally got passages to different parts of Europe. On the Contrary we find such of our People as are taken onboard Merchant Vessells are either made to work onboard the Men of War or detained onboard the prison Ships under intollerable Ill usage & no distinction between Master, Mates, Foremast Men & Negroes which surely is an unnecessary cruelty on Men who are taken from an innocent pursuit of a Maintainance in that line in which they were bred. We dont know how they Treat their Captives out of Merchant Ships carried into the Eastern States, but immagine the same conduct is observed as here & unless Ld Howe will do the same by ours, it is time to retaliate by forcing some to work onboard our ships of War & committing others to Goal or putting them onboard Prison Ships &c. There are now two very honest Masters that sail out of this port, detained onboard the Whitby Prison Ship, Capt Thos. Bell, & Capt Jacob Getshius. If his Lordship will not release them on the principles proposed, Mr. Morris will engage to send two British Masters for them if sent here on parole and will be much obliged to your Excellency to propose it. Bell has been very useful heretofore & shou'd not be left to suffer, therefore we hope you will excuse us for troubling you with these matters.(1) The Movements of both armies in New Jersey are again become very interesting & we wait impatiently for further Authentic intelligence. In Consequence of letters from Genl Stephen & Ld Stirling we have requested Genl Ewing to send forward all the Force now here & what may come in, up to Bristol & Trenton Ferry to guard the passage of the River shou'd it be attempted by the Enemy & that the Commanding Officer shou'd give you Constant intelligence of his Strength.  For the Committee of Congress I am your Excellencys obt Servt, Robt Morris  P.S. Your dispatches of the 7th are just come in.(2) Mr. Byers is here & shall be set to work immediately.  ""

  Dear Sir, Baltimore 9th January 1777 I have no doubt but that Mr. President inclosed you with his last dispatches the printed account of General Washingtons success at Trenton. The number of Hessian prisoners there made, do not fall much short of 1100. Since that event we have had no regular account from the army, but from a Committee of Congress at Philadelphia we have the accounts brought into Philadelphia by a number of persons and believed there, in substance as follows. The British forces stationed at Brunswick, Trenton, and other places in New Jersey, hearing of the success at Trenton, collected and marched towards that place to attack our army, now strengthened by the junction of all its detachments and by several corps of Militia. Gen. Washington ordered two Brigades to advance on the Princeton road and interrupt the enemies march. About 3 miles from Trenton they met the enemy and being attacked by a much superior force, were compelled to retreat, which they did slowly keeping up a retreating engagement until they joined the main body drawn up on the heigh grounds on this side a bridge that divides the village of Trenton nearly in two parts. The enemy attempting to force the bridge were received by Gen. Mifflin with the Philadelphia militia and a number of Field pieces, who drove them back with great loss, and some batteries being now opened on the heights commanding the enemies part of the Town, they were soon obliged to quit it with loss. The armies still continued posted opposite each other until midnight, when Gen. Washington (having received certain intelligence that Gen. Howe was on his march in person, with a large reinforcement to join his army ) having previously directed large fires to be made to deceive the enemy, decampt, made a forct march that night to meet Gen. Howe, met with him at a place called Quakers bridge, gave him battle and routed his troops, taking from 6 to 800 prisoners. Pursuing the fugitives he entered Princeton where a number of Officers, 6 or 7 field pieces, and the 40th Regiment were taken. The British army that remained at Trenton knew nothing of General Washingtons design until they heared the firing next morning, and then, having possessed themselves of the heights for some time, they retreated towards Brunswick along the Pennytown road, a circuitous, western way, leaving the place of engagement on the right hand a good distance. This extraordinary motion denotes panic, because their direct rout to the scene of action was along the road to Princetown, as thus (1)  The account goes on-That our Army was pursuing from Princeton to Brunswick, where the enemy had large Stores kept. We know that Gen. Heath with above 3000 men is about Hackingsack and Colo. Ford with 1500 Jersey militia is before him in the way to Trenton. This is the posture we understand things to be in, and we wait in hourly expectation of receiving authentic intelligence of the total rout of the enemies army in JANUARY 9, 1777  Jersey and their disgraceful evacuation of that State. Thus we bid fair to derive great advantage from what we once apprehended would injure us extremely, the dispersion of our army. The enemy knowing we had no army, and trusting to their Tory intelligence that no forces could be collected, had divided their troops in such a manner as to expose them to ruin from Militia only, or chiefly so; for excepting about 1500 Eastern troops, the same number of Virginians, about 200 of Smallwoods Marylanders and a broken Pennsylvania regiment, the rest of Gen. Washingtons army is Militia. Another valuable consequence will result from this success, it will prove to our enemies that America, without an army, is formidable in its militia. For sudden exertions, the Militia certainly do well, but they cannot bear the continued discipline of camps and campaigns. This certainty makes it of the last importance that our regular Army should be assembled with all possible dispatch, and such you will find to be the sense of Congress by their requests to the several States for this purpose. Our wicked Enemy to Freedom & all its friends, are actually preparing to try Gen. Lee by a special Court Martial. For it seems, that in order to be aided by a court martial that Gentlemans resignation of his commission was not accepted. We have sent to remonstrate with Mr. Howe on this subject, to demand Gen. Lees enlargement on his parole, and to assure that the same infliction exactly that is applied to Gen. Lee, shall directly be applied to 5 Hessian Field officers and Colo. Campbell their favorite Engineer who shall be reserved for that special purpose. We have offered 6 Hessian field Officers in exchange for Gen. Lee. I heartily wish you the compliments of the season, and am with great esteem dear Sir your most affectionate and obedient servant, Richard Henry Lee [P.S.] Be pleased to let the scheme of lottery be published in our papers that people may be prepared against the Tickets are sent.

  Sir. Philadelphia January 9th 1777.  I have the honor to transmit you herewith a letter from the Honb Mr Ellery who desires me to give you an account of the battle of the 3 inst. which he supposes to have been fought at Trenton.(1) Common fame had been too busy and magnified the transactions of that day by private in- JANUARY 9, 1777  telligence to Baltimore far beyond the reality. I take it for granted Mr Ellery has given you the situation of the 2 armies on Thursday evening the 2d instant as I transmitted to Congress an exact account thereof. That night Genl Washington (not choosing to risk a general action the next morning) decamped with his whole army except a guard of 500 men so privately that even that guard did not miss him, and by a forced march in the night he got between Trenton and Princeton leaving the main body of the ennemis army waiting at the former place, in the expectation of attacking him there, for they had taken post within cannon shot and placed their out guards at each end of Trenton Bridge within 100 yards of each other. In the morning our guard were astonished to find their commanders gone. The comr of the Guard cannonaded the enemy awhile to amuse them and then followed the baggage of our army which he brought to Burlington. When the ennemie found the Americans gone and heard a firing between them and Princeton they were in the utmost consternation, got under arms, took possession of the heights expecting to be attacked and waited untill they were undecieved, when they marched fast as they could for Princeton. The firing they heard was an engagement between three regiments of British, some broken Hessians and Highlanders and our advance party within a mile and a half of Princeton in which this small body of the enemy behaved very well but were soon routed with the loss of about 50 or 60 killed and abt 100 taken prisoners. Our people pushed on to Princeton where they killed and took a number more with some field pieces, blankets, baggage, cattle, sheep and stores.  The Genls original design was to have surprized Brunswick also but his troops were quite exhausted with hunger, thirst and fatigue; many of them had not slept, eat or drank for 36 hours, numbers of them were almost naked and in short they were not in a condition to undertake any new exploit or to wait an attack from an enemy superior in number. Less fatigued and better provided the Genl therefore quitted Princeton, took up some bridges to impede the enemy and went aside to Somerset Court house where they rested that night. He is since got to Morris town where I hope he is greatly reinforced by Genls Heath and McDougal. Genl Howe is collecting his forces together and their armies are again become very interesting. The enemies loss at Princeton was not less than 600. At Trenton on the 26th 918, and at various times consequent of the action of the 26 inst-300. Since the action of Princeton several more parties and stragglers have been brought in by Militia so that upon the whole their loss in killed, wounded and prisoners must be considerably more than 2000 In N Jersey and I hope to hear soon of further success. My time being much taken up in public business you will excuse me for not being more particular and I have the honor to be, Sir, Your honor's most obedient servant, Robert Morris.  ""

  My Dear Bror. Baltimore 9th Jany 1777 I have not receiv'd a line from you since my arrival at Philadelphia which was on the 24th Octor last, since which the Fortunes of our army have been various, accounts of which have undoubtedly long ago reached you. The Sourse of all the evils that have happen'd us is the short inlistments, it was owing to this cause that the Enemy made such advances in New Jersey. They being well inform'd of the scituation of our army took the advantage when the time of Inlistments expir'd & oblig'd Genl. Washington with a handful of men to retreat over the Delaware they keeping possession of Trenton which is about 30 Miles from Philad. The Enemy also sent a Party of about 1000 Men to Burlington about 17 miles from Philad. & had possess'd themselves of all the Towns & Villages in Jersey from Hackinsack to Burlington committing the most Horrid raviges wherever they passed. All this did not move the People to turn out to stop these destroyers of their Country. In short it was generally thot that they wod get possession of Philad., many in that City being ready to receive & it's probable invited them. In this Scituation it was thot most prudent for Congress to adjourn to this place where I arriv'd the 17th Decr. Since I left Philad. several Regiments from Ticonderoga & from the Eastern side of Hudsons River have join'd Genl. Washington, a considerable number of Melitia & Southern troops have also join'd him & on the night of the 25th he cross'd the Delaware above Trenton & surpris'd a Body of Hessians in that town most of which he Brot off as You'll see by his Letter which I suppose will be in all the Papers before this reaches you. Since this enterprise he has had several skirmishes in which he has been Victorious. By the last accots. he was on his march from Princetown to Brunswick & if he does not suffer the Enemy to out General him I am in no doubt he will utterly destroy Howe's army. This will be, in that case, a glorious begining for the Year 1777. However the Fortune of war is uncertain, Victory may again change sides, be that as it may, I am always prepared for the worst, being ready at the same time to meet the smiles of fortune. JANUARY 9, 1777  You have no doubt heard of Genl. Lee's being taken. By the Proceedings of the Enemy with him he is to be try'd as a deserter having in time past held a Commission under the Tyrant of Britain. Congress have directed that six Field officers in our Possession shod be offered in exchange for him, & have inform'd Howe that whatever treatment Lee receives shall be exactly observ'd towards them. If Poor Lee shod be Hang'd, the Law of Retaliation will most assuredly be executed in turn, they are accordingly order'd to be closly confined. Every accot. from abroad are as favourable as we could wish. The British Tyrant is using every art with all the Courts in Europe to gain them to his Interest but his schemes have hitherto been unsuccessful especially with the only two that can be serviceable to us viz France & Spain. Among other things his tools have Confidently asserted at the Court of France that an accommodation was made between him & America which our Commissioners at that Court have possitive orders to contradict. I can't conceive the Reason that I have no Letters. The last I Receiv'd was under the 25th or 27th Novr. Has every body in New Hamr forgot me or what can it mean I am a greater stranger to whats doing there than I am to whats doing in Georgia. I shod impute it to some obstruction in the Post office were it not that the Gentn from Massachusetts have letters every week. I suppose You are now retir'd to winter Quarters; pray let me know how your Plantation goes on; what do you think of a few Hessions next summer as settlers? Those that have been taken are exceedingly Pleas'd with Captivity & I believe wod Gladly settle in the Country. I suppose we have now from 1500 to 2000 of them & hope by the time this reaches you, You'll hear of as many British, in the same scituation. If Mr. Howe meets with the treatment that I expect he will in New Jersey He'll be oblig'd to call his Troops from Rhoad Island. I have wrote a long letter but what it contains I don't know nor have I time to look over it, it being almost one o'clock & the Express who carries it goes off early in the Morn, must therefore wish a good night & Happy New Year.

  Sir Jany 10th 1777 You have herewith a letter from his Excellency Genl. Washington which is the latest Account we have from that quarter. We have not understood before that Genl. Mercer is a prisoner and immagine there is some mistake in that matter, because Dr. Potts visited him after the Enemy had passed JANUARY 10, 1777  through Prince Town. Therefore if he is now prisoner they must have sent back a party to make him So. You have also a letter herein from Mr Palfrey and another from Mr Huntingdon expressing their great want of Money, in consequence of which we have got back the 50,000 Dollars which we lent to the Council on Safety, drawn on the Loan Officer for 50,000 more and this morning have dispatched a waggon under the Escort of Captain John Chew and his Company of Kent County light Horse with 100,000 Dollars to Mr Palfrey at Newton. Thus you will see our fund is nearly exhausted as the loan Officer has no Certificates by him. Several Captains appointed by the State of New Jersey to recruit Companys to serve during the war meet with Success but want money, the confusion in that Country prevents their being regularly supplied and as that service of all others Should be most promoted, we have and shall supply those that produce proper Credentials, which we hope will be approved of. You will please to receive also enclosed herewith two Letters from Ld Stirling, and One from General Stephen. Upon the receipt of these Yesterday, we communicated them to Genl Ewing and the Council of Safety, requesting the General to Send Colo. De Haws with all the troops now in the City to Bristol and Canton them from thence along the River, to order the Commissarys of Stores & of Provisions to send forward Sufficient supplies and to direct the Commanding officer to correspond constantly with Genl Washington and the other Generals that have Seperate Commands informing them of his Strength, that they may order him to March on if the Enemy do not look this way. As fast as the other Troops come here they shall be sent forward, but there begins to be a great want of Muskets, Cloathing, Accoutrements and all sorts of Necessarys. All the troops that pass through this place are in totall want of every Article, and altho we have aimed at keeping Blankets, the best Muskets and Cloathing for the new Recruits these things are delivered out either by Orders of Commanding Officers, Council of Safety or one Authority or another. Pray Heaven that American States may never more be obliged to call Militia to the Field. It is the most ruinous, destructive, expensive way of supporting a war that human invention can devise.  Our River is full of floating Ice here & must be fast above, so that Genl. Howe has a Bridge Ready if he chuses to March this and there is but little to stop his progress.  We cannot conceive however that he will make so rash an attempt in the present state of things for altho we admit he may with great ease get here, yet we don't know how he could Support his Army nor See any chance of their ever getting back again. Nothing can Support an Apprehension of their coming but the experience we have had of their rashness and folly in Other Movements. As fast as we receive intelligence it shall be communicated to Congress. We have agreed with a person to Superintend the Building of a Magazine at Carlisle, he is to go up there next week to seek for proper stores, employ persons to quarry it, and fix on the  best Seat for it. We shall address him to Mr Wilson whom we hear is gone thither, but on this Subject we beg leave to Suggest to Congress that it might be much safer, both on Account of Accident and Enemies to have two Magazines for Powder of half the Size of that ordered, one at Carlisle and the other at Reading, the expence not much encreased thereby. We have sent Capt. Isaac Coran who has been the director of the Elaboratory for twelve Months past to bring the Men that have worked under him from Fish Kill hither that they proceed to establish the Elaboratory Congress have directed, and desired him to wait on Genl. Washington in his way for Such instructions as he might think proper to give. We mentioned sometime ago the waste and destruction that were going forward in the Continental stables here.(1) The more we enquire into that Matter the more ruinous we find it, and the business is now in Such a state of Confusion that we hardly know how to remedy it. Our Opinion is that no Such thing as a Continental stable should ever have existed. General Mifflin when he proposed it and established it we well know meant to Save mony, but the experiment will prove destructive to the last degree. The Horses after being worked to the Bone, become neglected because it is nobodys business to take care of them, the Feed is stolen, wasted and destroyed, because nobody can tell who is intitled to it, and who is not, every Officer in the service Crams his Horses into the Public Stables and calls him Continental, every Team that is hired and ought to find their own feed, say they are Continental and demand it as a right from the Public. Mr Hiltzhimier does all he can to prevent waste, imposition and abuses, but they threaten his life and to burn his Stables. We sent him a Gaurd and they were as bad as the waggoners. Enclosed you have a Copy of the return he has made and of his note to us. In short if the Present Campaign was closed we should think it would be best to sell all the Continental Horses and waggons, shut up the Stables and encourage private people to provide the public with them on hire by good prices, for then the Horses would be taken care of and the feed not be wasted. and these are now very material objects. We are sir, Your Obedt serts.  ""

  Sir Philada. Jany 10th. 1777 The enclosed four drafts of Rd Caswell Esqr. Treasurer of No Carolina on the Continental Treasurer have been presented to us for payment, but as we Conceive they shou'd first meet the approbation of Congress, they are sent for that purpose. The holder of them desires to receive the money here & if you direct it they shall be paid out of our Funds, he seems  JANUARY 10, 1777  very impatient for his money & hopes the bills will be returned for payment immediately. The 9th Virginia Battalion is nowhere & in want of a paymaster. The Colo recommends Mr Robt Foreman to that office as you will see by the enclosed Note. The Colo wants money to pay off their arrearages but seems embarrassed for want of a paymaster. We shall advance him the Sum of Ten Thousand Dollars which is Short of what is due to the Regiment & he must be accountable for the same. We have also advanced Colo Antill one Thousand Dollars for the recruiting service, he wants more, and the New Jersey recruiting officers all are in Want. These officers all agree that Men enlist very fast and we hope there will soon be a respectable army, but we must have more money or quit the Committee room. It seems Genl Mercer was put under parole by a Surgeon of the British army & therefore Considered as a prisoner.

To you, the Congress have submitted the Propriety of making an Attack on the Province of Nova Scotia with a View to destroy the immense Quantities of military Stores that are there deposited to be employed against us (1)  I need not particularize the vast Advantages, or the Glory, resulting from this Expedition should it be happily carried into Execution. Nor need I suggest Motives to stimulate you to undertake it. Being fully convinced that if shall appear to you practicable and calculated to advance the Interest of America, you will most certainly adopt it, I shall only add, that the Destruction of above Half a Million of Stores must be a Severe Blow on the Enemy, and may possibly prove a principal Mean of ridding our Country of those cruel Foes, who, with impious Hands have been spreading Ruin and Desolation over it, to the utmost of their Power.

  Dear Sir Philada. Jany 11th. 1777  I have written you a long letter on the present State of public affairs (1) & intend this on Commercial matters. Your favour dated Paris 30th Septr. last is the only one I have from you (2) and from the tenor of it I judge that several of yours to me & mine to you must have miscarried. I have long been aware that you wou'd suffer vexation for want of remittances & have often told the Committee so, yet such has been our Situation & Circumstances it was not possible to mend the matter. In a former letter I told you of the several Captures of ships & Cargoes intended for different parts of Europe to provide you with Funds. Our Ports were shut the greatest part of the Summer & now again when we expected them certainly to be open, the Enemy are Cruizing at the mouths of our Bays and along the Coast with more industry than ever. I have told you in my other letter that the Eastern States had little fit for exportation to Europe, their Fisherys being prevented there is no Oil, Fish, whale Bones &c as formerly, they are not employed in making Pot & Pearle ashes as usual & in short there is nothing for an European Market but Masts & Spars from New Hampshire, some little Bees' Wax & Flaxseed in Connecticut & Rhode Island. The Secret Committee gave orders to Mr Langdon to Ship Masts & Spars on the Public Account & to John Bradford Esqr. at Boston to purchase such Prize Goods as wou'd serve for remittance. They Commissioned Mr Shaw at New London to buy Flaxseed &c but all to little purpose. Mr Langdon has done something the rest have not. At New York nothing cou'd be done you must be sensible, indeed Genl Washington was obliged to stop? for the use of the Army some Cargoes that Mr. Livingston & Mr Lewis had shipped there. Here we were blocked up the best part of the Season and lost several Valuable Cargoes intended for you. Indeed the principal part of our Trade was obliged to be carried on in small Vessells & these Were hardly sufficient to pay for the necessarys we imported from the West Indias. In Maryland & Virginia we have been buying much Tobacco & as fast as Vessells cou'd be got to carry it to Market JANUARY 11, 1777  they have been sent off but they are very Scarce in all the States to the Southward of this, and Seamen, Cordage, Canvass & other materials still more Scarce. To send them from one part of the Coast to another was extreamly hazardous whilst our Enemies Cruizers covered the Seas in their very track. However we have been obliged to adopt this mode & buy or charter Prize Ships in N England to go in Ballast for Virginia, Maryland & Carolina. Whether they will get safe in or not is very doubtfull but if they do, we hope you will still be provided in the Course of this Winter with satisfactory remittances for we have many thousand hogsheads of Tobacco ready & that Article of all others will make the best remittance. From Carolina they had no Trade at all untill very lately that some small Vessells have gone from hence with flour & Iron to them & some few French Men from the West Indias have ventured thither, however the Committee have lodged Funds & orders with Messrs. Levinus Clarkson & John Dorsius to Ship largely in Rice & Indico, and if they can get Ships this will be done, the same from Virginia & Maryland, and from hence when we can but our River is now full of Ice & our Bay pestered with British Men of War. In short you may perceive clearly that it is absolutely necessary the French shou'd send us aid in the naval line. A few Line of Battle Ships under our direction last summer wou'd have totally destroyed Ld Howes fleet & Transports & a few of them next Summer will command our Rivers & Bays so that Ships may get in & out. When once at Sea they must take their Chance & that we are content to run, but whilst they can ride securely masters at the mouths of our Rivers & Bays it is next to impossible to escape and so we have found it. These Considerations induce me to wish you may have negotiated some loans with the French Court that they may become so interested as to send their men of War in order to Cover their own Remittances. We did not find it necessary to direct Remittances for you into Holland as France cou'd draw on Lisbon, Cadiz &c equally well, but unluckily little has arrived for them to draw. I am very sensible of your difficulties and I think those you are Connected with must be sensible of ours and that they will exert themselves to get them removed, however I wish you may have Negotiated a loan & shipped the Goods and Stores you mention for the West Indias that we may get em from thence in small fast Sailing Vessells unless you cou'd send them out in Men of War of the Line. In the late Confusion & alarm at this place I sent all my Books & papers out of Town where they still remain so that I cannot at present have referrence to what I wrote you the 5th June, but I am much concerned that you depend on Insurance being made here. This business has been totally dropped this Summer for altho the Underwriters might otherwise have been willing to Continue it, yet the ample employment every body have found either in public or less hazardous business, induced them to lay it onside, and as things are now Circumstanced it wou'd be impossible to pre-  vail on them to take it up again in this City. New York is in the Enemies hands, so that there is no place but Boston where there is the least chance of getting Insurance done & even there they are not fairly got into their geers again. I hope my Brother has Communicated to you what I formerly wrote him on the Subject of Insurances & that you will have got them done in France or Holland on whatever property you may have Shipped this way.  As yet nothing has arrived nor do I know of any thing you have shipped being taken. Capt. Morgan was taken near Cape May & is but just discharged from the Man of War.(3) He tells me he had but little Goods onboard & that the dispatches were all Sunk. The Young Man that was passenger with him is still detained at New York a Prisoner. I suppose it was by him you wrote respecting the Loan I had mentioned &c. Shou'd you have engaged in a plan of sending out Goods to the Value mentioned & we are tollerably lucky in getting them in, great things will be done, they will sell for enormous prices and I will invest the money in Tobacco, Indico, Rice &c which shall be shipped back fast as possible. The things intended for your Family I suppose were onboard Capt Morgan but have not come to hand. I shou'd have been proud to had an opportunity of sending them forward. I had the pleasure of seeing one of your Brothers here some time since who told me all your Family were well.  Tobacco is to be sure a fine price in Europe and I hope we shall benefit thereby before long both for the Public & in some degree for ourselves also. Shou'd you obtain a French Fleet to come out here, then will be the time to Speculate and I wou'd have you to charter & send out some Ships with Salt for Virginia, Maryland & this place to carry Tobacco back. My Brother will Conduct the Business & you & he must fix the Concern or Shares, but if no fleet, send no Ships, let us wait & look further first. The Congress give me too many employments & heap vastly too much on me for any Man living to do as it shou'd be. If they had left me to manage their Commercial matters & those only I cou'd have done great things, but instead of that all their active business is pushed on me, much against my judgement altho inclination prompts me to do what I can in any line that promotes the Service of my Country.  I wish for time & opportunities to write you much oftner than I do and I am also very impatient to hear from you again being Dr sir, your obedt Servant, Robt Morris  ""

With respect to any purchase you have made on Speculation in which you have interested me or did intend to interest me, I am content to abide by what you have done and reposing unlimited confidence in your judgment and integrity, I agree that you proceed in such speculations as I formerly proposed to the extent then mentioned, and I will send you money to pay my quota fast as you advise me of the Sums necessary. Thank God I think our City is now perfectly safe and as I think the British Troops must soon evacuate all New Jersey, our intercourse will become free & open again. In the mean time if you are obliged to advance Money or borrow it, to pay my part of the purchases I will chearfully pay the interest. The Congress have appointed myself & two other Members that happened to remain here a Committee to Conduct the Continental business in this place & plenty of it we have & are like to have.  I gave Mr. Alexr Rose & Mr N. Eveleigh of South Carolina letters of introduction to you. These Gentn deposited considerable sums of Money in the Loan office here & took with them the Continental Loan Office Certificates bearing interest. I persuaded them to this measure supposing they wou'd readily get money for the Notes in all or any of the Eastern States, but I depend on you to prevent their being disapointed of which however I hope there is not any danger, but rather than they shou'd suffer I will send them the Money from hence on notice that it is necessary. I am very happy to learn the Alfred is arrived in your Port & her Prize at Bedford in Dartmouth, the Cargo of that Prize will be particularly usefull to the States at this time as the recruiting Service for the New Army goes on very fast. The Wolf is sailed from Virginia with a Cargo of Tobo for Curracoa & I hope will arrive safe.

  Dear Sir Philada. Jany 12th 1777 I have been possessed of your obliging favr. of the 2d Ulto a considerable time,(1) but being too much pressed with public & private business to permit my being a regular correspondent it is needless to apologize. You undoubtedly must have been acquainted with the Rapid progress made by our Enemies through the Jerseys and the danger to which this City has been exposed for some Weeks past and you will have heard of the removal of Congress to Baltimore in the midst of pannic. This step has been highly censured by many of their Friends and undoubtedly lost them the confidence of some valuable Men.  I confess for my own part I am not amongst the number of those that Censure them for this hasty measure, for when it is considered that the Enemys Troops were within a very few miles of us & no apparent Force sufficient to oppose their progress, it surely was time for a public body on which the support of the American cause so much depended, to provide for their safety. Meer personal safety I suppose wou'd not have induced many of them to fly, but their Security as a body was the object. Had any number of them fallen into the Enemies hands so as to break up the Congress America might have been Ruined before another Choice of Delegates cou'd be had & in such an event they wou'd have been deemed criminal & rash to the last degree. Most of them dislike their present Station & complain horridly, particularly those you esteem, but it seems some others who generally carry their points, like their quarters & are for staying. I suppose it answers some of their purposes and I have but one objection in the world. They have appointed Mr Walton of Georgia, Mr Clymer & myself a Committee to transact all Continental business that may be necessary & proper in this place. The business of this Committee engrosses my whole time & increases daily, so that I am now the weriest Slave you ever saw and wish them back to be relieved.  I wish to Heaven they had removed from hence last winter. If they had, Pensylvania wou'd long since have had a wholesome constitution, its Strength might have been drawn into proper exertion & her Capital wou'd never have been made to tremble. What has happened is the fruits of that winters Cabals. Our Constitution is disliked, the People divided, unhappy, and consequently weak, the power if any there be, is placed in improper hands and in short the people seem to loose one day, the Confidence they placed in leaders of the day before.  Where it will end God only knows. Dickinson & A. Allen have given mortal stabs to their own Characters & pity it is the wounds shou'd penetrate any further, but they were men of property, Men of fair private Characters & what they have done, seems to pierce through their sides into the Vitals of those who have similar pretentions to Fortune & good Character. The defection of these men is supposed to originate in a desire JANUARY 12, 1777  to preserve their Estates & consequently glances a suspicion on all that have Estates to loose. I pity them both exceedingly. Dickensons Nerves gave way & his fears dictated a letter to his Brother advising him not to receive Continental money. His Judgment & his virtue shou'd have prevented this act of Folly, I call it such because I believe his Heart to be good & regret much that his exalted Character shou'd be degraded, by what cou'd hardly be called a crime at the time he did it, but he thought the Game was up. A Allen deserves a better fate than he will meet with. Aimiable in private character and deserving of the Felicity he has heretofore enjoyed he has rashly sacrificed it by a hasty resolution. He has long thought it impossible for us to withstand the power of Great Britain & he complained of that Conduct amongst ourselves which has been loudly censured by America's warmest advocates & frequently exposed by the keen sentences of Mr. Jay. However nothing can justify the step he has taken & it seems wrong to paliate it. I will therefore only say I am most sincerely sorry for him. I removed my Family & some of my effects in the heat of our Fright but determined to stay by the City to the last moment. Very happy have I been since, in this determination, as it is fallen in way to be very usefull on many occasions, both to this State & to the Continent, and in every instance I have exerted myself to the utmost. Congress are Sensible of it and have approved all my doings, altho I acted for a considerable time without their Authority. I join in all your Sentiments respecting our good Friend Duane and if I had not been well convinced how III used he was by that cursed piece of Slander I shou'd not have troubled him with it, nor shou'd I have sent it when I did, but having heard he was coming to Congress, I thought it my duty to prepare him. I have a letter from him on the subject and think he treats it very properly by despising the report & its author or authors. I wish to heaven the affairs of your state wou'd permit both your attendance at Congress, believe me you & others are wanted there. There is a leader there that you do not like and as I understand they have the rule of the roost totally since their removal to the Southward. Pray shew this to Mr Duane & tell him the next bit of leisure I get shall be devoted to answer his two letters.  I do not pretend to give you any acct of military operations as I suppose you get them from day to day. What a glorious change in our prospects. Pray heaven Continue our Success and grant me an opportunity of Congratulating you on regaining the City of New York. I have not heard from Mr. Deane for sometime past & fear he will complain for want of remittances & Intelligence. These Damnd Men of War plague us exceedingly & have taken many of our Vessells, but we must persevere untill we gain success. I am Dear Sir, Your affectionate Friend & Servt,  Robt Morris ""

  Sir, Philadelphia Jany 12th 1777 As you would undoubtedly hear of the unhappy situation of this City for some week's past, you would naturally suppose that to be the only cause why you did not hear from me. When the British troops made such a rapid progress through the Jerseys and got within a few miles of us, the Congress thought proper to remove to Baltimore. At that time I sent my family, my books, papers and considerable effects into Maryland but having still a great value here and being desirous of spiriting up our people, all in my power, I determined to wait until the last, happy in having done so, as I have had an opportunity of being very useful both to this country & the general cause. The Congress knew this well, and have appointed myself and two others that remained here, a Committee with full powers to transact all Continental business that may be proper and necessary here. I mention this as an apology for not having wrote you sooner, for I do assure you, the business of that Committee engrosses so much of my time that I cannot attend my own business. The letters I rec'd from you in answer to my proposals for speculating in prize goods &c &c are in the country with my other papers and such variety of business has gone through my hands since that I do not perfectly remember their contents, but think you had made some purchases which I very much approved at the time and wished you to proceed, being certain that goods bought with judgment at moderate prices must answer very well.(1) I continue of the same mind and authorize you to proceed not doubting your utmost care and attention as to quality and prices as well as to the safety of the goods after bought. I wish also that you would buy a good prize vessel, double decked and pick up a cargo for her suitable for France, dispatch her for Bordeaux consigned to Messrs Saml and J H Delap with orders to make sale of both vessel and cargo provided that vessel can be sold for a sum equal to her first cost which I am in hopes will be very reasonable. You'll put in a prudent, careful master and send her away soon as possible because I think the risk of the voyage inconsiderable during the winter. I do not particularize the articles to compose this cargo because I don't know what you can get, but masts, spars, oak plank, beeswax, pearl and potash, fish, oil &c &c are wanted in that country and will answer well if laid in at moderate prices and unless this can be done, I would drop the plan altogether, but if it can be executed reasonably the sooner the better and the value of vessel and cargo not to exceed three thousand pounds lawful money. You'll tell Messrs Delap to hold the proceeds in their hands subject to my orders and if they cannot sell the vessel to send her back to you with a cargo of salt. You will want money to execute this business and I am in hopes can supply yourself by drawing on me. You may depend JANUARY 12, 1777  the bills shall be punctually paid but if that will not do I will furnish you with money from hence from time to time the sums you may write for.

The Danger of employing Persons in the Post Office Department, either as Riders or Deputies, whose Principles are unfriendly to the American Cause, being both great and obvious, the Congress are anxious to prevent it, if possible. With this View they have passed the enclosed Resolve,(1) in Consequence of Information that some Persons have been engaged in that Department, whose Disaffection might probably lead them, either to betray the Dispatches committed to their Care, or to pay so little Attention to their Duty on the Road, as not to arrive in due Time.

Colonel Steward who was with you in the Jersies gave me an Accott. of your Scituation, & of the loss of your fine horse, I really pitied your Case, but knew your Fortitude and the prospect of a speedy Union to your Family would induce you to Surmount all Difficulties, and to press forward to the Goal with unremitting Diligence, and wish this Letter may meet you safe at home enjoying the Felicities which you have long been a stranger to, & which I am very Confident you there found equal to your wishes, as I Trust you found your Family happy in health, & doubly so on your Arrival. I Beg my best Respects to Mrs. Paine, & to all Friends with you.  My Scituation upon Leaving Philada. was really distressing, you well know the State of my Family at that time, a Wife but Nine Days in Bed, a little Infant just Breath'd in the World, a large Family & considerable Effects, all to take Charge of, in the Winter Season, cold Houses to put up at, & such a Number of passengers on the Road, doubtful whether I should even obtain Shelter, & among Strangers too. All these Circumstances with many others, needless to mention, plac'd me in a Scituation truly distressing, & indeed is what I cannot Describe tho' I severely felt it. But by the Kind hand of Providence I pursued my Journey and arriv'd at this place without any accident, & my wife & little one & indeed all of us bore the Journey far beyond my Expectation. On my arrival I had no house prepar'd, Mr Purviance was so obliging as to Take us in, & we Remain'd there Ten Days, & we were Treated by him & his Lady with the utmost Civility, in short I never met with more Civility in my life, free from Ceremony, & Desirous of making our Stay Agreeable. Mrs. Purviance a Polite, agreeable Lady, I Respect the Family much, their Civilities will ever endear them to me. I at length got to housekeeping; but the Change was disagreeable enough; from Mr. Purviance's in a good part of the Town & among Friends, to my own & the only one I could get, in a Remote place among Whores & Theives, I had not been Forty eight hours at my house before it was Rob'd, the Theives took out a Trunk with Linnen, Books, papers, some hard Money &c, but the Money was Recover'd & part of the things, that I am oblig'd to keep a good watch lest they should Take every thing out of the house. I long to Return to Boston, I think it my next Turn; I have just Rec'd the new Delegation; some of you must Come on here, for three are oblig'd to be constantly present or the Representation is Destroy'd. I brought your Trunk safe here, & have it with my things in my own house. subject however to be stolen with mine; I will Embrace the first good oppory. to Send it to  you, there is a Vessell here from Boston, if she Returns I believe shall send it, tho' if a prospect of Sending Money soon I shall prefer the Land Carriages. I have lately sent Three Expresses to Boston, you will of course know from them every thing passing in Congress, the last carried a most important Resolve which I am witheld from committing to Paper, but you have a right to see, to the Council I must therefore Refer you.(1) The late Successes of Genl Washington in the Jersies have given a most favourable turn to our affairs, you will undoubtedly know every particular, as early as we, that it will be needless to mention them, but in general the Enemy are Retreating, & by an Express this moment Rec'd it is said they have Cross'd the Rariton, but I hope Genl Putnam will meet them, who is gone the Amboy Road; had not our Troops been so Fatigu'd as to prevent their pushing into Brunswick; and they had gone on, they would have taken not only the Troops & Stores, but £70,000 Sterlg. in the Military Chest, however I hope we shall still get it; in short, My Friend, I think we are in a clever way; the Safety of Genl Lee is insur'd by these Movements, for we Recd an Accott. they were preparing for his Trial at New York, & he would no doubt have been Executed. They have, since the late Success at Trenton, treated our Prisoners very differently, have Releas'd many, among others Mr Carpenter late Barber at Boston who has been so long Confin'd at Halifax & York, he is now here in my house; & Col. Ethan Allen is now walking the Streets of New York, & is to be Exchang'd. I hope soon to be able to give you a good Accott. of things. The Resentment of the Jersey Men is Rais'd, & they are turning out well, & so are the militia in general in Pennsylva.

  Dear Sir Baltimore Jany 13th 1777  I would apologize to you for the trouble I give you, did I not know your readiness to countenance every person, who steps forth to relieve America from the distresses that threaten her. This will be deliver'd to you by Capt Thos Nelson who is going up to join his Regiment under General Washington. He is Brother to the young Gentleman whom I recommended to you the other day. To the honor of this family be it spoken that there are but three Children, Sons of aged Parents, and they are every one of them in the Regular Service, and are now on their march to the Jersies. This Gentleman may perhaps want a supply of Cash sometime hence; You may render him an essential service by answering his drafts, which will be punctually paid at sight.

  My Dear Sir Baltimore 13th Jany 1777 Since my last we have had accots of many Skirmishes in Jersey in which our Troops have been Victorious. We lost about 20 men at Princetown on the 3d inst among which was some Brave officers. I don't recollect their names except Coll Hazet of Delaware & Major Morris of the Phila Militia. Genl. Mercer was said to be among the slain but it seems he was only wounded & like to do well. He had 5 Bayonet wounds. About 100 of the Enemy were killed in this action & 3 to 400 taken. We have kill'd & taken more than 2000 since Chrismas. Our loss since that time does not exceed 40. The last accot from the Genl. was the 7th inst. He was then at Morristown & the Enemy no where to the westward of Brunswick. I am inclin'd to think that the Humain Mr. Howe is sick of his Winter Campaign & I fear will escape with the Remains of his Army into York. The Ravages committed by the Enemy have had a most excellent effect on the people of Jersey. The Militia now turn out with great spirit & Harrass the Ravagers of their Country in every quarter. I fancy the Tyrant of Britain has been Premature in confering the Dignity of Knighthood on his Humane Dispenser of Pardons. His Popeship seems to be in a fair way to lose all his Lauralls. The Hessian Officers complain much that they shod be distinguished as Plunderers, when, they say, the British Troops Plunder more than they do. I believe the truth is they both endeavour to excel in what they know will recommend them to their Commander in chief.  I am really at a loss to account for my not receiving any intelligence from N. Hampshire. I am as great a stranger to what is doing in that state as to what's doing in the moon. How goes on your recruiting service? What officers have you for the new army? It is of the last importance that the new Leavies should be Compleated without loss of time. The greater our exertions the sooner we shall put an end to this destructive war.  Business goes on with spirit since we have got out of the Putrid air of the Sodom of America. Several Prizes have lately arriv'd here. The Delaware is again clear of the Enemies ships. I suppose they were call'd in for the protection of York, for it seems the Present inhabitants of that City were exceedingly alarm'd at our late Success.  I shall set out for home in about a fortnight unless I am reelected. In that case I shall have no objection to continuing here till the coming season will admit of traveling with more comfort then at present. We have various reports from Rhode Island but no authentic advices.  My Colleague (1) is well & desires his Compliments to you. We agree very well in sentiment, but, Inter nos, N.H. is oftener div---- d than she used to be. My Regards to all Friends & be assured that I am with every Sentiment to Esteem, Your Friend &c, Wm.

  Sir Philada . Jany 14th . 1777  Having taken a Copy of the enclosed address from the Convention of New York to their constituents & given it to Mr. Lewis Weiss to translate into the German Language with orders to Print immediately One thousand Copies of it, we send you the original not doubting but it will be JANUARY 14, 1777  very pleasing to Congress as it has been to us. We recommended Mr Weiss to preserve in his translation the Spirit of the original if possible. The Convention of New York if we remember right desired 300 Copies in Dutch. We mean to send you 2 or 300 Copies to be Circulated amongst the Germans of Virginia & Maryland & the rest to be dispersed amongst those in this province & altho the Convention may publish it in their State, yet few of their publications may reach the rest of America & we wish for orders to publish it here either in News papers or in a pamphlet as may be judged best. You have herewith a letter from Genl. Washington of the 9th,(1) there are later accounts in Town & every day brings fresh intelligence of the Capture of Prisoners or bagage &c. However it is certain the Enemy are Collecting their Force at Brunswick & we must not expect they will close the Campaigne in the disgracefull Style it now wears for them, if they can help it, & we are of opinion they are meditating some blow against Genl. Washington or this place. This opinion is Coroborated by the Account Capt Thos Bell gives us. He was taken at Sea & carried into New York, and after some time got leave to go onshoar where he had an opportunity of seeing & hearing what passed. He says the affair at Trenton came on them totally unexpected and alarmed 'em exceedingly. They ordered all their troops from Long Island except those under Command of Oliver Delancy & about 500 under Govr. Montfort Brown that they nearly swept all away from N York as he does not think there is 1000 left in that place. He left that place last Wednesday & that day a Gentn who had no suspicion of his coming away (for he ran away) told him they were collecting all their Force at Brunswick on purpose to route & brake up Genl. Washingtons army. He learnt also from the Master of a Transport that formerly used this place, that he with many other Transports was ordered up the Sound to Rhode Island to bring down 5000 Troops from thence & he saw the Ships go up the sound. I have sent this Intelligence to Genl Washington informing him that Capt Bell is a Man of Veracity & certainly heard what he relates, but does not aver it of his own knowledge.  I send you herewith a Newspaper brought by Capt Bell who says most of the Men of War are out Cruizing and he understood were to keep our Coast all Winter, they have taken many Prizes & we fear will do us much mischief.  You have herewith a letter Capt Bell brought from a French officer (to RM) who he says is a Count, a very Gentleman like man that was taken in a Sloop bound from Bourdeaux with Powder. This Gentn had dispatches from Mr Deane which he threw overboard, there is a translation of his letter also. This Gentn thinks himself extreamly ill used by Ld Howe, resents it highly & carrys himself very high when he sees anybody belonging to him.   We enclose herewith a kind of Memorial from the Chevalier Devernijou, a Young Gentn that was with General Lee when taken. He signalized himself at that time by the resistance he did make & the strong desire he shewed to defend the General. We ordered him a months pay advance as Capt of Horse to which Genl Washington has appointed him in those now raising in Connecticut. Congress will please to direct whether any Compensation must be made for his losses and this matter deserves serious attention as there will be other applications of the same kind. The French officers alledge that their Monarch makes good the losses his officers meet with in Battle. Genl Gates no doubt will be able to give good Council on this Subject, our officers shou'd be encouraged, but the States must be taken care of. We are told Colo Houssicker is in New York wearing a black Cockade, here he wore a red one. There are bad reports & Suspicions respecting him.  We are sorry to inform you of the Death of Genl. Mercer, which Major Morris (Genl Lees aid du Camp) says happened as he came through Prince Town. We have daily reports of partys taking Prisoners & baggage in the Jerseys. The Militia of that State are certainly turning out, but we hear such of ours as have been out six Weeks talk strongly of returning. We are daily obliged to grant Money for the recruiting service as well as for other public purposes & unless a fresh supply is sent up to Mr Mease we fear being run aground. We have given him another order on the Loan office for 50,000 Dollars, but believe they are not all there yet. With the greatest respect we remain, Sir, Your obedt.

The Marks of Regard you are pleas'd to mention as contain'd in the few hasty Lines I Sent you are very far short of what I early Express'd after I had the pleasure of a Connection with you, & be assur'd, Sir, in whatever Scituation I may hereafter be, or however distant from you, it will be a pleasureable circumstance to continue and keep up a Correspondence, not only in the Commercial & publick Line, but in a solid, friendly & free intercourse of Letters, and without hesitation I shall tell you, that hereafter I shall take the Liberty of a Friend, [. . .] all Freedom in Addressing you, as Business will Admit, and shall be Ambitious of being Reckoned among the List of your Real Friends.  I exceedingly approve your Conduct with respect to the Ships in your River, & think your officers discover'd the Spirit of Men, at same time your interference under the then Circumstances was absolutely necessary, I dare say your disposition of the several Arm'd Vessells after you are fully convinc'd of the removal of the ships from your Capes, will fully meet the approbation of Congress. Without the least appearance of Flattery I can assure you your whole Conduct since our Flight is highly approv'd, & happy I am that you Remain'd. Many agreeable Consequences have Resulted from it, and your continu'd Exertions will be productive of great good. I must therefore beg you will continue as long as you can, tho' I sincerely wish you a happy Sight of good Mrs. Morris, but I fear your departure from Philada. might Occasion a Relaxation that would be prejudicial. I know however you will put things in a proper way, indeed all depends upon you; and you have my hearty thanks for your unremitting Labours. The Publick are much Indebted to you, & I hope to see the Day where those publick Acknowledgments shall be made you.

I have only two Rooms below, & one of them [I was] oblig'd to let my Servants occupy. In point of Convenience I wish to Return to Philada. which brings me to the hint in your Letter. I think Sir, that as the Printing presses are here & set to work, & as money is so exceedingly wanted, & a Removal just at this Time would occasion so great a Delay, that it would not be prudent to think, unless thro the greatest necessity of a Removal at present, nor untill the last of March. By that time I hope we shall be able to return or to fix upon some other place for our Residence, that must depend on Circumstances. As things have turn'd out I am very sorry we Remov'd at all, & indeed I think we were full hasty enough, it damp'd people much, but your Continuance there & Conduct  ing Business there will give a spring, & Join'd to the Influence of our successes will make up for the flight of Congress.

  Dear Sir Carlisle 14th Jany 1777  Congress see, at last, the Propriety of distributing the executive Business of the Continent into different Departments, managed by Gentlemen, not Members of Congress, and whose whole Time and Attention can be devoted to the Business committed to their Charge. Measures were adopted, when I left Baltimore, for making the necessary Arrangements.(1)  There is an Office, which, I believe, would be of considerable Use to the Public, if properly discharged. I will describe to you my Ideas of it.  The Duties of the Officer should be-to manage all Admiralty Causes, on Behalf of the Continent, in the Courts of Admiralty and Appeal, where the Congress sits-to conduct all Enquiries and Prosecutions instituted by Congress-to give his Opinion upon such Questions in the civil and maritime Laws, and the Law of Nations as shall be stated to him, for that Purpose, by Congress, the Board of Admiralty, the Board of Commerce, or the Committee of secret Correspondence-to draw, or reduce to Form public Instruments, when required by Congress, or the Boards, or Committee aforesaid.  Several other Duties will naturally fall to his Share, which cannot be enumerated, nor comprised under any general Head.  The Propriety of the first Article is obvious. I shall suggest one advantage, that will probably result from it. It will be of Importance that the Laws and Practice of the Courts of Admiralty should be brought, as soon and as well as possible, into a System. By the Intervention of Juries, which are unknown in the Admiralty Courts of other Countries, this is rendered a Matter of much Delicacy and Difficulty. The uniform Practice of one, whose Duty and Business it would be to make this Subject his particular Study, wou'd be of considerable Use. All conversant in Courts know that they receive a Tincture from the Practioners as well as from the Judges. JANUARY 14, 1777  The second Head of the Duty of this Officer is, in my Opinion, absolutely necessary. Enquiries must be had into the Management of public Affairs: Prosecutions also must be instituted against public Officers, who are accused of mal-conduct. When a Committee is appointed for such Purposes; it is every Body's Business to manage Matters-you know the Consequence-it is no Body's Business. The Friends of the Person accused think themselves, and are thought by others, justified in doing every Thing in his Behalf. It is troublesome-it is disagreeable, without having an official Obligation and an official Justification, to undertake the Task of Prosecutor, to manage the Examination of Witnesses who appear, to direct others to be sent for, who, from the Course of the Testimony, are discovered to be capable of throwing Light upon the Subject, and to take many other Steps, without which the Matter cannot be sifted to the Bottom. The Result is, that Things are Superficially passed over, without Satisfaction to the Public, to those who make the Enquiry, or him, concerning whom it is made; provided he has been innocent. An Officer, appointed to manage Enquiries and Prosecutions, on Behalf of the Public, would prevent these Mischiefs.  The third Branch of the Duty of this Officer is by far the most important. I hope the United States will never be involved far in the Maze of European Politics, but it is incumbent upon us to know something of them, even to steer clear of them. Every Letter from our Commissioners at foreign Courts-almost every Resolution of Congress about foreign Affairs will bring into View some Principle of the civil or maritime Law, or of the Law of Nations. It is impossible for Members of Congress, however enlarged their Genius, and however extensive their Knowledge may be; accurately to investigate Subjects of this Kind amidst the Hurry of so much other Business, which likewise demands their Attention. Treaties are considered, in Europe as a Kind of Science. In our Transactions with European States, it is certainly of Importance neither to transgress, nor to fall short of those Maxims, by which they regulate their Conduct towards one another.  All States as far as I know, have an Office similar to that which I have described. It includes Part of the Office of Advocate General, and Part of that of Attorney General in England.  If your Sentiments upon this Subject correspond with mine, you will mention it to Congress. If they agree to institute the Office; and no one offers for it better qualified, in your Opinion, than myself; I will be obliged to you for proposing me. My Reading and Course of Studies have been such as, in some Measure, to prepare me for it. One Thing I can engage-that no Pains nor Industry shall be wanting on my Part, to qualify myself as fully for it as possible.  I have expressed myself with all the Openness of a Friend to a Friend. I would not mention the Subject, if I did not think it of Consequence. I would not mention myself, if I did not think I could be of Service in this   Line. I have not been so unsuccessful in private Life, as to be obliged to obtrude myself upon the Public.  You will make such Use of what I have written as your Judgment and your Friendship shall tell you is proper.  I am, Dear Sir, Your very humble Servant, James Wilson  P.S. I presume you are now at Baltimore: if at Philadelphia I will be obliged to you for a few Lines on the Subject of this Letter.(2) Direct your Letter to the Care of Mr. William Null Mercht in Baltimore. If I should be still here when it comes to his Hand, he will forward it to me.(3)  ""

  My Dear, Baltimore 14t Janry. 1777 As I have Wrote to you so lately as the 1t and 5t instant, I have little more at present to acquaint you with, than that by the Blessing of God I am well. To hear from me I well know will be a Satisfaction to you, tho I JANUARY 14, 1777  can easily beleive from my own Desire to hear more frequently from you and the Family than I have done of late. My last Letter was from Mr Lyman of the 21t of Novr wherein I have any particular acco of your own and Family Wellfare. But I trust that a merciful Providence takes care of, and Protects you and them. As I am by my Situation acquainted with most of the Oppertunities of Writing to the eastward, so I generally Embrace them, and I Wish my Friends would in Return Write to Me as often as they can.  As all Material Intelligence comes at present from the Eastward it is probable you will have an earlier Intelligence of what is going on [in] the Jerseys than I can inform you of. In the late Skermishes at Princtown &c it seems the Enemy sustained a Loss in killed, Wounded and Prisoners of about 5 or 6 hundred, the loss on our Part Very inconsiderable. The Enemy were by the last Acco. collected at Brunswick, Genl. Washington about 20 miles Northerly from them at Morris Town. The Enemy would not continue long in that Situation, so that We may soon expect to hear farther Action in that Country. We have no News from R. Island since the Enemy landed there.  I hear that Oliver has lately gone Home, and that there has been a Colledge Vacation on Acco. of their not having a Steward to provide for the Scholars, but I hope that Inconveniency is before now remedied, as I should be sorry that he should lose any time, and Wish he might be under the best advantages for Improvement.  I Wish these troublesome Times were over, that We might injoy those peacefull and happy Days which We have formerly done. But this I do not Wish for till the Rights of the Country are fully secured. How long a hardened unjust Foe will Maintain the Controversy God only knows. Well Satisfied I am that the Force which they now have in this country will be Very unequal to Subdue it.

  Sir, Baltimore Jany. 15th. 1777.  Since writing yesterday I have Nothing further in Charge from Congress, but to transmit the enclosed Resolves, by which you will find, that  JANUARY 15, 1977  they have adopted such Measures as if properly and vigorously executed, cannot fail to establish the Credit of the Continental Currency, upon which, every Thing depends.(1) The-Depreciation of our Money has been for some Time past, a growing Evil; but I trust a Foundation is now laid by Congress for putting a Stop to it.  Our Anxiety to hear from the Army still continues-and no Wonder; as the Movements of the two Armies, may produce Events of so great Moment, as to be attended either with the Ruin of our Army or the Salvation of America.  General Schuyler has wrote in the most pressing Terms for Steel & Nail Rods; and I am to request you will comply with the enclosed Resolve, and forward the Quantities therein mentioned, to the Northern Department, as soon as possible.(2)  I have the Honour to be, with great Respect, Sir, your most obed. & very hble Servt.

  Dear Sir Baltimore 15 Janry 1777 I have been favoured with your letter of the 7th Inst,(1) and as it principally related to the business of the Ordinance Board, I am now to inform you that the members who at Phila. constituted that Committee are at present absent, and from the pressing applications of Generals Washington, Schuyler, & Col. Knox for Cannon, the Congress has appointed Messrs. Haywood, Whipple & self to that department, a department that is quite new to us and therefore cannot be executed with the precision we could wish, especialy as Mr. Paine (the former Chairman) has taken with him all the documents relative to that board.(2)  Pursuant to the aforesaid applications, Congress has directed the Committee to procure Ten six Inch Brass Howitzers, forwarded to Tyconderoga as soon as may be.(3) We are therefore of opinion that Mr. Byers be immediately employed in casting those Howitzers, and the Council of Safety at Phila. be desired to agree with him upon the best terms they can, but should Mr Byers for want of proper Moulds or by other obstructions, be incapable of casting Howitzers, in that case, he should be employed in casting as many brass Field Pieces as he may be furnished with Mettle for that purpose.  The. proposals made by Messrs Imbert & Co. we have carefully perused; but from the present distance of Place and other cogent reasons, we are at a loss in giving a satisfactory answer, but imagine that either Mr Imbert should be here to make his Contract, or that he be reffered to the Council of safety at Phila. in behalf of the Congress for the same, as that Board must be more competent Judges of its practicabillity than we can be at this distance, especialy as such a Foundery will be erected upon JANUARY 15, 1777  a large Scale. We think also the following Queries should be previously investigated, Vizt Where is the Foundery to be erected so as to be most convenient for the supply of Sea Coal. From Whence is the supply of Mettle to be obtained. What number of Brass Cannon of certain Sizes, can be delivered in any given time; and at what Price per pound &c, they furnishing all materials, or (versa visa) We furnishing them.  In their proposals they ask what price we will give in Government Contracts. It is customary to know first what price they ask. However as the General Officers are very urgent with Congress, that an ample train of Field Artillery be provided for the ensuing Campaign, we could wish a contract of this kind might be effected, therefore if you think Mr Imbert & Co. equal to this business He should be prevailed with to come here.

  My Dear Sir Baltimore 15th January 1777 My last was the 7th inst since which I have not rec'd any of your favors, though I am in anxious expectation of a letter from you every  JANUARY 15, 1777  post. I hope you'll find no difficulty in procuring the two vessels to send here for iron and flour. Several vessels have lately arrived here from different parts of New England and have brought a considerable quantity of sugar which has made the sale of that article rather dull but I don't find the price to be lowered though other articles in the price current enclosed in my last will meet a much quicker sale. I hope you'll be able to fit out the vessel ordered by the Secret Committee; many vessels are wanted to export produce from the Southern States and if you can purchase 3 or 4 besides those already ordered at reasonable prices you will do a very acceptable service. I suppose you will want money; shall therefore send what remains in my hands of the 20,000 per first opportunity; if you want more you must let me know it and I will endeavor to forward it.  The last accounts from General Washington was the 7th inst. He was then at Morristown about 28 miles from Brunswick where the enemy's main body lay. He was forming some plan to attack the enemy. There had been many skirmishes in which our people had been victorious. We have killed and taken of the enemy since Christmas upwards of 2000 and the utmost that we have lost does not exceed 40. The ravages committed by the enemy in Jersey has had a most excellent effect; the inhabitants now turn out with spirit and breathe vengeance against the ravagers of their Country. The British Tyrant's humane Dispenser of Pardons it seems had cantoned his troops out in the several towns from Burlington to Elizabeth Town with orders to the officers of the several posts to collect all the provisions and forage allowing the inhabitants so much as they supposed necessary for the-subsistance of an ordinary family-the remainder they were to consider as a magazine of the enemy and seize for the King- thus we see how those miscreants commonly called Torries are to be treated by their good friend. I heartily wish all the States would follow the good example of their oldest sister Virginia and banish all those wretches.(1) I enclose you papers which contain some things that ought to be spread thro' the States among which is the Address of the Convention of New York. This piece is printing in the German language.(2) The Crisis is a most excellent thing. I wish the author was more at leisure that the world might benefit more by his speculation.

  My dear Sir, Baltimore Jany 16 1777 We receivd a letter a few days ago from the Council of Massachusetts Bay, requesting a Sum of Money for Payment of a Bounty to the Troops to be raisd in that State. Accordingly three hundred thousand Dollars are ordered for that Purpose, which will be forwarded to the Paymaster in Boston as soon as it can conveniently be done.(1) In the Mean Time I hope our Assembly will advance if necessary, for the Levies must be made at all Events.  I observe that our Assembly have made it necessary that three of their Delegates should be present & concuring in opinion, before the Voice of our State can be taken on any Question in Congress. I could wish it had been otherwise.(2) Three only of your Deligates are now present. It may so happen at other Times. One of them may be sick. He may be on a Committee or necessarily absent on publick Business, in which Case our State will not be effectually represented. While I am writing at the Table in Congress, a worthy Colleague (3) is unavoidably employd on Business of the Publick at home, and the two present cannot give the Voice of the State upon a Matter now in Question. Were all the three present, one of them might controul the other two so far as to oblige them to be silent when the Question is called for. But I only mention the Matter, and submit, as it becomes me, to the Judgment of my Superiors.  Major Hawley and my other patriotick Fellow Labourers, Are they alive and in Health? I have not receivd a Line from any of them, excepting my worthy Friend Mr Nath Appleton, whose Letter I will acknowledge to him by the first opportunity. My Friends surely cannot think I can go thro' the arduous Business assignd to me here, without their Advice & Assistance. I do not know whether you ever intend to write to me again. Assure the Major from me that a few more of his \""broken Hints\"" would be of eminent Service to me.(4)  You cannot imagine how much I am pleasd with the Spirit which our Assembly discovers. They seem to have put every County into Motion. This forebodes in my Mind that something great will be done. I have not, since this Contest began, had so happy Feelings as I now have. I begin to anticipate the Establishment of Peace on such Terms as independent States ought to demand, and I am even now contemplating by what Means the Virtue of my Countrymen may be secured for Ages yet to come-Virtue, which is the Soul of a Republican Government. Future Events, I have learnd by Experience, are uncertain; and some unlucky Circumstance may before long take place, which may prove sadly mortifying to me. But no such Circumstance can deprive me of the Pleasure I now enjoy, of seeing at a Distance (not I beleive very long) the rising  JANUARY 16, 1777  Glories of this new World.

  Sir Philada Jany 16th. 1777  We wrote you yesterday by Colo Grayson,(1) since which the dispatches herewith sent, have come in from Genl. Washington, Genl. Schuyler & Colo Wayne,(2) and we have particular pleasure in seeing General Heath mentioned as moving towards New York, it has been long reported, but now we can depend on it. Colo Hartley who brought this letter from the General, says the Enemy was obliged to burn some of the Houses in Brunswick for want of Fuel and he gives us room to suppose it will not be long before another stroke is struck. The Enemy allow that the movement of our Army from Trenton & the blow at Prince Town, was most excellent Generalship. Mr Morris has a letter from Colo Wood that mentions his & Colo Waynes Regiments being obliged to lye under half Worn out Tents in the severest Cold Weather on the 15th & 16th Decr in so intense Cold, that three of his men & four of Colo Waynes were froze to Death in their Tents & the Ice made Six inches thick in two Nights.  We observe there is not 1000 men fit for duty in that Garrison & their times expired, but as we expect they are relieved or soon will be, by fresh men we beg leave to suggest that our Weakness in that Post might be best covered & they diverted from any attack on us, by our People striking a sudden Blow against them. Albany & all the Country round it is famous for Slays & Sleds and we have no doubt but General Schuyler cou'd with ease collect a sufficient Number to carry 1000, or 1500 Men across the Lakes, with such Stores, Provisions & Artillery as may be necessary, the JANUARY 16, 1777  quantity of these need not be very considerable because the movement in Slays will be very rapid & the sole object of this expedition shou'd be to burn all the Enemies Vessells in the Lake which we apprehend may be effected with ease & when once done, let them return. The Surprize of the Enemy will prevent their following. We hope this matter may deserve attention & if the plan be adopted some Sea officers might be found here that wou'd be usefull. Congress will excuse us for troubling them with our thoughts, we shoud do it were we with them. We have the pleasure to inform you of the safe arrival of the Sloop Sachem, Capt James Robison, from Martinico, but the letters are not yet come up, so that we know not what stores or advices she brings. You shall be informed soon as possible. The Men of War having been chasing her about the Coast for ten days past, but she slipt in at last & we believe is got into Morris's River from whence we shall order up her Cargo in Waggons. You have herein the Copy of Capt Jones's Acct of his last expedition in the Alfred, he is a fine Fellow and shou'd be constantly kept employed. If the Congress please I will propose to him one or two expeditions & leave him to take his Choice of them. The Enlisting business goes on firmly but we fear the fitting out of Militia will drain all our Magazines & distress us again when the new Army get together, however we have the pleasure to enclose you Copy of a letter from Messr. Abm Livingston & Mr Turnbull two young Gentn sent by the Secret Committee to procure cloathing in the Eastern States, also one from Mr Otis, which are pleasing.

  Sir Baltimore 16th Janry. 1777 I was favoured with your letter of the 1st Inst together with sundry resolves of the Honbl the Convention, and their printed Address to their Constituents, all which I have communicated to Congress and they highly approve of your measures.(1)  I am directed by Congress (at their expence) to get a sufficient number of those Addresses reprinted here, in order to be disspersed through this, and the southern States, as also a number to be struck off in the German  JANUARY 16, 1777  languge, 300 Copys of the latter to be forwarded to the honbl Convention at Fishkills. As there is no Press with Types for the German languge in this Town, I have this day sent one Copy to the Council of safety at Phila. requesting them to get it translated into that languge, and when printed to send the first 300 Copys to you, the rest to be disspersed through that, and the neighbouring States.(2)  Permit me Sir to repeat my sentiments on the necessity of having the State of New York fully represented in Congress, which has not been the case for many months past, and tho' Congress in their collective capacity has ultimately the public good in view, yet such is the depravity of human nature, that partiality will often (and perhaps impreceptably) influence the minds of individuals when the interest of a particular State is immediately concerned.  I have the pleasure to inform you that Congress has seriously considered your late application relative to Cloathing the Troops raising in your State, and they have promised to exert their utmost abillities to effect that necessary business. In September last Congress requested the legislatures of the several States to appoint in their respective States a Commissary for the purpose of purchasing all necessary Cloathing and in November the Secret Committee sent off two Agents (one of them Mr Abm. Livingston) with instructions to confer with those Commissaries in each State, as far eastward as New Hamshire, to assist in the purchasing & procuring said Cloathing, to make returns of the quantity & quality both to Congress & Genl Washington, to be distributed to such Troops as shall be inlisted upon the new establishment but we have not as yet received any advice from those Gentlemen.(3)  On the 12th last month when I left Phila., there was in the hands of Mr. Hayman Levy, purchased by order of your Commissary Mr. Curtenius, shirts, stockings, &c, amounting to upwards of 211000, with orders to send them to Mr VanElvendorph at Esopus, but such was the confusion among the Citizens of Phila. in moveing their Effects, that it was impossible for me to procure Waggons. I therefore obtained a press Warrant from the Council of safety, & delivered it to the Waggon Master Genl., & I have been since informed they were met with upon the Road to Minnisynk, should be glad to know If they arived.  I have the honour to subscribe myself, Sir, Your most Obedt Humbl Servt, Fras Lewis  P.S. On the 15th Capt. Rogers arived here in the Armed Vessell Montgomery belonging to your State, with two Prizes vizt. a Brigt. & Schooner, the former with 3000 bushels salt from Anguilla, the latter with a valuable Cargo of salted Beef, Pork, Hams, Linnens, Woolens, sail Cloth, Cheese, Shoes, spices, Port in hampers, Beer, Pease &c bound from Hallifax for Nw York. The Salt is claimed by a person of this Town as his property, said to be on freight. Upon Capt Rogers's applying to me for advice, I immediately employed a Proctor to file a Libell & prosecute to Condemna-  tion. I have supplyed Capt.

When the General is acquainted with the Distribution of the Arms &c among the Militia passing thro' Philadelphia he will take the proper Steps to prevent the Persons to whom they were furnished from carrying them off as their own Property on their Return from Camp. This is too often practised, & has superadded to the real Want of Arms an artificial Scarcity, & is one among the many & ruinous ill Consequences attendant on the Militia Scheme. Could the Arms be drawn out of the Hands of the Militia & put into those of the regular Troops it would be a great Point gained & this the General when properly informed will be able with his usual Prudence to effect. The Board have been told that there were a great many supernumerary Arms at Camp.

  Sir Philada. Jany 17th. 1777 The enclosed letter of the General (1) came to our hands about an hour ago, and gives the latest Accounts we have from that quarter. Colo Housicker whom we mentioned in our last in an unfavourable point of light, has just been with us & gives such an acct of the manner in which he was taken & the cause of the Enemies favourable treatment of him as in our opinion wipes off the suspicions that many People had entertained of foul play. He is under parole and says all the Continental officers & Prisoners that are able to walk are coming from New York on parole. We are under an absolute necessity of pressing Congress to send up a large supply of money, the calls on us for payments of various kinds increase every hour, what you sent us has been exhausted long since. We have drawn all that was in the Loan office and are sorry to say it does not flow so freely in there as we expected. Many People that had sums of money by them, sank it into the Country at the time of the late fright & have not brought it back again. Others who are disposed to lend their money to the public say they cannot afford to do it. They live on the interest of their money and so great a reduction as one third of their income when the expence of living is doubled, renders it impossible for them to lodge their money for 4 per Cent. Indeed we find this complaint extends over the Continent and are fearfull the Loan may not be so successfull on that Account. Widdows & Orphans suffer heavily on this occasion. Their money is paid in, they must keep it for opportunities of placing it at 6 per Cent because they cannot subsist on four but were the Interest fixed at 5 per Cent they wou'd still put in their money rather than loose time in waiting for private securities. In short various arguments may be offered in favour of five per Cent being allowed but the most essential one is that 5 per Cent will command the money & we fear four per Cent will not. If an addition must be made, the sooner the better & let it be extended to all the Certificates already Issued or hereafter to be Issued. We are now borrowing on our private Credit to repay the money in a few days, therefore must press for speedy & ample supplys. We are called on by the Genl., by Commissarys, by recruiting officer, Waggon Masters, paymasters & in short are surrounded by claimants of one sort or other and the business must not stop or be starved.(2)  You have enclosed herein the Copies of some letters respecting about 200 Indians from different Nations that want to hold a Treaty at East Town. The assembly of this State, the Council of Safety & Mr. Walton from us are now in Conference on this Subject. We propose that each shou'd send a deputation to the proposed Treaty & if so Mr Walton will go on that service Sc call in Colo Geo. Taylor of Northampton County one JANUARY 17, 1777  of our Colleagues to his assistance. We suppose some presents will be wanted & Congress will please to signify soon as possible their pleasure on this Subject both as to Mr Walton & Mr Taylor, & in respect of presents, with any instructions they may think proper. If any such come in time they shall be obeyed. If the Treaty is to be held soon & no orders We shall deem our powers sufficient to Authorize the above proposed deputation with liberty for them to Concur with the assembly & Council of Safety in such measures as may promote Friendship & preserve Peace with the Indians and be most likely to Conduce to the general Welfare of America.(3)  We have the pleasure to inform ,you that a Brigt Jamaica Packet, Cap Wickes, after running the most imminent risque of being taken by the Roebuck in several attempts to get into our Capes, & passing through a smart fire from her lower Tier, by the Bravery & good Conduct of the Captain has escaped & is got into Chester River in Maryland. This is one of the Vessells that was Stopped in Hamburg by Mr Mathias the British minister there. We dont yet know what her Cargo Consists of but expect it is valueable. She was intended to bring 1000 bbls powder, some Brass Canon & muskets, but are apprehensive it has been the Condition of her releasement that those articles shou'd be taken out of her, & if so she will have Considerable quantities of Ravens & Russia Duck, Oznabrigs, Drillings & other German Goods. The Captain writes that he wou'd take Horse & come up here soon as he had got the Vessell & Cargo safe to Chester & you shall be informed all particulars soon as we know them. No further Account from the Sachem yet. We are now at the morning of the 18th, have received your dispatches by Pluckrose the Express & shall send the Packet to the Genl by the first officer going to Head Quarters. No further news.

You know Sir that by a late resolve of Congress the General is to fill up all vacancies in the Continental troops that shall happen for six months from the date of the resolve. I have recommended it to the Major to get a letter from you and the council, with one from Colonel Harrison, to the General in his favor, and if he is very intent on success, to carry them himself.(1) I think this will not fail to procure him the commission he desires, and in the meantime the Lieutenants and Ensign may be recruiting the company. We have not heared from General Washington since the 5th instant when he was at Morris Town in West Jersey, about 20 miles from Brunswick where the enemy keep their head quarters. But a Gentleman who arrived here yesterday, and who passed thro our army at Morris Town on the 8th says the men were in high spirits, that he thinks they were 12,000 strong, that they were under marching orders and they were supposed to be going towards Elizabeth Town, which is between the main body of the enemy & New York. That Gen. Heath was to join them on the 9th with between 2 and 5 thousand men. That the Jersey militia had many skirmishes with the British troops and always beat them. That he met large bodies of militia on march to the Jersies, whence he concluded that the enemy must either quit that State soon or be exposed to great danger by remaining there.

  My Dear Sir, Baltimore 21 st Jany 1777 Last Sunday I rec'd your favor of the 26th ulto by Mr Betten. I assure you it was a great rarity-you refer me to several letters which have not come to hand which I suppose is owing to some defect in the Post Office. The postmaster has lately had a rap which I hope will produce good effects. I have obtained an order in favor of the State of New Hampshire for 100,000 but as there are large demands on the Treasury at this time I don't think it possible to send Mr Betten away in less than a week, if so soon.(1) By him I shall send the money you desire. I have rec'd no directions from you to pay Mr Wharton. I enclosed you Capt Smith's receipt for 2700 dollars for the schooner Friend's Adventure-he happened at Philadelphia in a very unlucky season, Congress being then about adjourning to this place and I was so exceedingly engaged in the business of Marine and Secret Committees that I could not pay that attention to Capt Smith that I should otherwise have done, however I hope he arrived with you safe. I wish to be infomed particularly how you go on, both in the Marine and Commercial departments. I was in great hopes you would have had guns from Connecticut for the Raleigh, but you say you have no prospect of them. No answer has been received from Governor Trumbull on that subject though I have long expected it. I am doing every thing in my power to procure them here and if my endeavors had not been so often baffled should think I had a fair prospect of success. I hope you are going on with preparations for the 74. Our removal hither has disconcerted matters, so that I have not been able to procure the dimensions but expect them from Philadelphia every day. In the mean time I hope the timber will be Procured and every other necessary that you can collect and I hope by the time this reaches you the vessels I mentioned in some of former letters will be on their passage here for iron &c.  We are in hourly expectation of some interesting intelligence from the army; by the last advices they had nearly surrounded Brunswick where the enemy were confined to a very small compass and much distressed for fuel and forage; it is also reported that Howe has ordered his troops from Rhode Island. It's said Cornwallis was going to carry the intelligence of the ravages they had made to the Tyrant and actually had his baggage on board when the news of the surprize of Trenton arrived at York. This and what has happened since puts a very different complexion on their affairs and I suppose will stop their Herald. Excuse this scrawl as I am in very great haste, yours &c, Wm Whipple  [P.S.] I shall write by Betten.  ""

I am not able to give you the least Advice in the Conduct of any Business, your own Prudence in the Direction of it I have no doupt of.

  Sir, Philadelphia, 23d January, 1777. The enclosed letter from the paymaster General, with a copy and extract of letters from his Deputies, came to hand this morning, which agreeable to his request, we send forward by express. Congress must certainly be fully convinced of the necessity of keeping the military chests constantly and amply supplied; and that a neglect of it may be productive of the most ruinous consequences.(1) We therefore would submit it, whether this matter should not command the attention of Congress in preferance to any other. Besides the exhausted chests in the military department, the empty fund at this place must be attended to. Though we are hopeful, after a while, that the Loan-Office in this state will keep it in a tolerable credit.  General Mifflin arrived here last night, and informs of a Skirmish which happened two days ago between a foraging party of the enemy about a thousand in number, and a less number of our Militia, in which the latter were successful; having killed about 20, and taken double that number prisoners; together with a number of English waggons and horses, and a large quantity of provisions which they had ravaged.  JANUARY 23, 1777  Generals Gates and Lord Stirling set out this morning, with the remainder of the Virginia Light Horse, to the Camp at Morris-Town.  We have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient Servants.  [P.S.] Since writing the above the enclosed letter from Mr Harrison, the Genls Aid du Camp, was recd by Mr Morris, & we have advised that Ld Stirling depart this morning & Genl Gates remain to arrange & forward the militia through this place. The Muskets, Blankets &c being almost exhausted it is a business of much difficulty to move the militia forward from hence as they expected to be equipped compleatly. Genl Mifflin will have abundant employment in his own department & cannot be taken off, as Commanding Officer without doing much injury to the service. He Calls on us loudly for money & large Sums he must have, the recruiting service is every hour calling for money & it is our constant study to work from hand to Mouth by giving each applicant a little & promising him more speedily. We find by Genl Mifflin that Capt Nicholson does not Count Numbers well, Genl Putnams force being far short of what he said it was, however we still think the Public Stores need not be moved, but wish your orders on that head.(2)  A report is just come that we have taken New York.

When present we have all the dispositions in the World to do the same things, but sometimes you know human frailties will predominate & then the best disposition & clearest understanding must give way for the moment Untill recollection takes place of passion & temper. When in fact we grow sensible of the error, and being convinced this is only the weak side of Human Nature, we are not much displeased with our friends or ourselves for discovering the Face of Clay. You make me exceeding happy as you may readily suppose by your approbation of my Conduct in Public business and I candidly assure you I saw the necessity of the times put a good face on all things & believe in the day of Tryal I have the good fortune to revive many drooping Spirits, at least the People here tell me so & some from Baltimore assure me of the same thing. I wish much to see my family. I want to see the Congress & some of the Committees I find want me, therefore I must come soon, but not till something is done in Jersey to put a fixed Complection to the Campaigne, the Generals now here say I must not depart & General Washington says I must stay, therefore it must be so, for a while at least, but when I do come I think I shall not bring Mrs. Morris to Baltimore. She is comfortably settled & that is not to be expected where you are, sorry I am that you have any Complaints on this score. We must have you up here again by & by. Mrs. Hancock, Miss Quincy & the little Philadelphian must not be fugitives in so uncomfortable a place if we can once assure them of peace, plenty & protection here, and I flatter myself that will soon be the case, but I shall not urge the return of Congress for the reasons you assign, sooner than they can move with Convenience. How comes it that you are so exceedingly greedy after News and discover so much impatience when we are silent. Have we ever failed one moment in telling you any thing that happened either good or bad after we cou'd clearly ascertain it. Have we not told you to be easy that you shou'd have information fast as we got it, but still this won't do. We must send to tell you nothing has happened. Why it is impossible to do that, you must be sure that is the case when you dont hear from us & not mind the Cursed lies that are eternally hatching in every mile of distance between Head Quarters & Congress. Was we to write you all the lies of the day we cou'd do nothing else.  I shewed Mease the paragraph respecting him & if he dont tell you how to address him write to Mr. James Mease Master Taylor of America & he will Correct the error if any there be. We dont go to the Oyster House for there is no Oysters, thanks to King Georges ships & the Ice, but I pay my devotions at the Hills most religiously every Sunday with Nesbit, Bache, Mease, Walton, Clymer &c &c &c &c. Here are not any Sperm  Candles in this City, but Mustard you shall have. I must either stop or get another Sheet, inclination says do, but time says no. Adieu. I am Yours etc. Robt Morris  ""

  Sir, Philada. Jany. 23. 1777  I take the liberty to enclose herein a copy of a letter from my friends Messrs Hewes & Smith of Edenton in North Carolina wrote from Hallifax in that State the 13th ulto by which you will see they have most unjustly been plundered of a part of their property on the High Seas, the only ostensible reason offered by the privateer or rather piratical Captain is that they are Tories, a most villainous assertion made to cover the baseness of the Asserters Conduct.(1) Mr. Hewes is a member of Congress, and has been so from the first-a warm & steady Friend to America, a zealous and steady Supporter of its interests & Independence, his partner Mr. Smith is a man of merit equally attached to the liberties of his Country, tho' not so much employed in public Councils. Perhaps if we do not begin in time, and bring such offenders to Justice, we may bid adieu to all security of property, for we shall have no leisure for other employments than a search after retaliation. Mr. Hewes is still in No. Carolina, but soon expected back to Congress, where he will represent this matter fully. In the mean time I hope you will keep a look out in all the ports of your state for his vessel and if found put in a claim, Commence an action against the Privateer & do every thing necessary to support both one & the other, informing Mr. Hewes or me soon as possible and all things necessary to support you therein shall be complied with.

  Pha Jany 24th 1777. In all the Transactions of America nothing has given me more Concern than that kind of irregular Conduct on bd the Am. Privateers that savours more of Moorish Piracy than Christian Forbearance. We have already many Instances that ought to be reprobated and the perpetrators brot to a Condign Punishment if the United States of America means to preserve a National good Character.  One I have menttione]d to the Committee of Secret Correspondence because there was an open violation of the Laws of Nations and a palpable Insult on our real or pretended good Friends the French.(1) Others have happened in Violation of the Authority of Congress and the Ships & Cargoes belonging to the States of America have been seized on Frivolous pretences and sent into their own Ports, those Insults have been overlooked because the States have probably not suffered any great Loss as the Property has reverted to them & the Captors have been supposed to act from good Motives &c but what shall we say for these Plunderers when Individuals, honest Industrious Men, Friends to the Freedom & Independence of America lose their Property Credit & reputation by these Depredations, & the Misrepresentations they make to Cover their own Villainies, indeed my good friend if we do not take some effectual measures to punish the guilty and put a Stop to this kind of Arbitrary Thieving we shall be Sharers in their Guilt and probably incur the suspicion of being Sharers in the Plunder.  I am led into these remarks by a letter from our Friend Hewes who has had two Vessells taken on the high Seas by Am. Privateers on no better pretence than the Captains pretending the Owners were Tories, the last of them is particularly ment[ione]d and described by Mess. Hewes & Smith in their letter to me of the 13 Decr a copy of which is enclosed, and when Congress have leisure I wish you would propose some Salutary Measures to put a Stop to these Growing Evils.(2) I think the Captains & owners of Privateers shd give Security in very large Sums, and every State be answerable to those who grant Com[mission]s to, this wod make the latter cautious & villains wod find it difficult to deceive them, something I am sure must be done unless we wish to plunder one another & lay all the World under Contribution as a lawless Set of Freebooters, which God forbid shd ever be the Characteristicks of the Country I love.

  My dear Julia, Baltimore Jany. 24. 1777.  I had rode but a few miles before the badness of the roads, the difficulty of the ferry, and the lazyness of Diamond convinced me that you had acted very wisely in determining not to accompany me to Baltimore. But upon my arrival here I was thankful that you did not share with me in the trouble I met with in procuring tollerable lodgings. At present I am accommodated in a room lately occupied by Mr Sergeant which I must abandon as soon as he returns which will be in a few days. The rain which fell yesterday has rendered the Streets so very muddy that they are impassible to women. No ladies are seen abroad but in carriages. It will be eno' of the expence of living here to tell you that Mr. Middleton After keeping his family at a tavern for a while at the rate of £100.0.0 a week was obliged for want of agreeable accommodations to send them to Annapolis thirty miles from this place. I have been told since my arrival here that our Assembly intend to leave me out in the next appointment of delegates as a punishment for opposing their new government.(1) Welcome this storm of popular rage! I shall kiss the rod that Smites. I never was so weary of public life, & never languished more for the Sweets of domestic life than since I parted last from you. You wished me a great deal of pleasure and frolicking at Baltimore when you bid me farewell. Alas! my heart sickens at the sound of what is commonly called pleasure. In this State of banishment from home & you, the music of Coralli would serve only to encrease my melancholly. To exchange a whole house for a single room, to request instead of commanding when the most trifling favor is wanted, and above all to give up a most affectionate wife for the society of strangers. To lay aside freedom, ease, and unbounded confidence in conversation for constant restraint, and formality, are circumstances that illy agree with a man of my age & disposition.  My brother (2) lodges in a tavern and perfectly harmonizes with me in complaining of Baltimore. My next letter I hope will be written in a better humor, and contain an agreeable acct. of the people to make up for the badness of the place. They are said to be very kind to strangers.  Adieu my dear girl. Much love to Mrs. Montgomery & the family. Leave your letters to me at Dowdle's tavern at Christiana bridge and they will come safely by the post. Yours-yours-my dear Julia.

By your Letter it appears that you have been inform'd, General Putnam has with him at Princetown a Body of Men not less than 6000, and that there are in Philadelphia three thousand. Upon this Representation, it is the opinion of the Board that it will not be prudent for you to remove any of the Stores, at least, until you shall hear from Congress which will meet on Monday next.(2)  Congress have appointed Mr. Thomas Butler Armourer, and he is gone to settle his Family affairs & will be at Philadelphia in about ten days.(3) You will however get the Arms repair'd with all possible Dispatch & not detain the Men for want of them until his arrival with you.  Inclosed is a Resolve of Congress which the Board desire you to have printed & sent to all the Departments where Militia are employd.

You are perfectly right in your opinion of the propriety of dispatching accounts of the events of this Campaign, and the more so, as the Loan on which you rely for supporting our credit under the failure of remittances, will probably depend upon Mr. Deanes receiving Congressional answers to what you may remember he wrote upon this subject. We approve entirely of the several orders you have given as mentioned in your letter of JANUARY 25, 1777  January the 14th. With respect to the West India Ship mentioned by Mr. Jarvis, we would refer you to what had been done on the subject of purchasing Vessels and Cargos to the eastward before we came from Philadelphia, but if you think that not sufficient, and the information you may receive of the enemy being retired, shall induce you to think the risk not too great, we willingly leave this matter to your discretion, and wish you to write Mr. Jarvis as you shall judge most conducive to the public good. With respect to the purchases you propose to make at Philadelphia, we are willing likewise to leave them to your judgement, as you are more in the way of being informed touching the station and movements of the enemy. The obligation that rests upon us to remit is certainly very strong but the danger of loss may be so great as to overcome it, since all that falls into the enemies hands will not only fail of remittance, but add strength to those we would wish to weaken as much as possible. As the rice from Georgia is otherwise to be disposed of, we give up the scheme of moving the Indigo here, and you may, if you please, ship it from Philadelphia. We must depend on memory, not having the books here, but we wish you to reflect, if the time is not near when a Frigate was by agreement to convoy goods here that were to be shipt by Mr. Merkle to the W. Indies ! We have but faint recollection of this business, you undoubtedly remember the thing, and we only mean to turn your attention to that subject.(2)  We have not yet conversed with Mr. Fitzsimmon about the Friendship, but should it happen that we do not agree with him, we shall endeavor to get a Cargo here for Mr. Curson as you propose.

  Sir Philada. Jany 26th. 1777 The enclosed letter from the General (1) came in last Night by Mr. McClenaghan one of the Light Horse of this City, who says that the day after he recd it, he heard a heavy Canonade succeeded by a long & smart platoon firing; from the direction & distance of the Sound he judges that Genl Sullivan who had about 3000 Men with him, must have marched from Elizabeth to Bonum Town & there been met by the Enemy which brought on this engagement. He stopped at a place about Seven miles from Brunswick & saw there a Woman who said She had just come from thence & that the Enemy's light Horse had rode into Town in a good deal of Confusion for a reinforcement. This Circumstance & no bad account having yet come gives a favourable cast to this affair and We hope soon to transmit you an agreable account of it. Mr Clenaghan says the Streets of Brunswick have above fifty Horses lying in them that have died for want of Forage, & those taken from them showed they have been Starved.  The Generals Question respecting Small arms, deserves much attention, all that have lately been imported have been put into the hands of Militia both here & in the Eastern States, and altho very considerable quantities may reasonably be expected this Winter, yet their arrival is very uncertain whilst the Enemies ships line the Coast, and as there now is undoubtedly more than sufficient of Good Arms in the Country some efficacious Method shou'd be adopted to draw them into Public arsenals from whence they may be taken as wanted either for the use of the army or Militia & at such arsenals Gunsmiths might be employed to repair & put them in good order. If one or two arsenals were established in each State & every Militia Man obliged to deposit his arms there when not in  JANUARY 28, 1777  service, it wou'd go great lengths towards curing the present evil, which is intollerable for as the practice now is, the Militia of America wou'd drain the Magazines of all Europe. Mr Walton sets off this morning for East Town to the Indian Treaty. Colo. Geo. Taylor was down here & we have prevailed on him to go with him, but we have not recd any instructions from Congress relative to this Treaty, if any do come they shall be sent after them by express. We observe in one of the Resolves of Congress Mr Lewis is directed to have the address of the Convention of New York translated & Published in the German Language & as we had wrote the Congress that we had undertaken that business here, we consider this Resolve as a reproof, therefore shall take care not to be so officious again, the Work of translating however is done & we believe either in, or ready for the Press.(2) The Delaware continues too full of Ice for Ships to Sail which is a pity as Capt.

Jany 28th. 1777  We have received Your letter of the 24th Inst. with Sundry Resolves of Congress to which shall pay due respect in all that regards us, an express shall be dispatched after Mr Walton & Mr Taylor unless we meet other JANUARY 28, 1777  Conveyance. The Council of Safety & they provided presents for the Indians before they set out & the Acct. thereof may be settled on their return. We shall duely attend to Mr Butler when he comes & have already directed Mr Commissary Towers to give him every information & assistance the nature of his duty may require.  Genl. Mifflin informs us it is absolutely necessary that a Riding School be opened here immediately for the purpose of breaking the Horse &c. We believe he is right and Congress will please to signify their pleasures. He wishes us to buy a Dutch Church that is to be sold here, as he thinks it well Calculated for the purpose & when done with, will be worth the money it costs, whereas if one is to be built it will cause delay & Expence that may by this purchase be saved. We are ready to give any assistance in our power to this business. We are glad to find 200,000 Dollars is coming up, but as every department are applying to us for money this will not last long and unless you raise the Interest we fear the Loan Office will not bring it in fast as we cou'd wish & shall want. We have not recd any regular account of the affair at Bonum Town mentioned in our last, but flying report says our People proved the Weaker party & were obliged to retire after Killing & wounding a good many of the Enemy. They also took some Waggons & it is also reported that another Skirmish happened on Friday more favourable to us. The Militia that have already served Six Weeks are now coming in, and as Mr. Dallam paymaster to the flying Camp is still here we have desired him to settle & pay their accts, at least such as the Council of Safety do not settle with. We sent him the Copy of Resolve of Congress 14th Inst. & ordered that he shou'd know it to be stricktly complied with before payment, that he shou'd be mindful to stop all advances & oblige the officers to swear to their Muster Rolls, so that we hope justice only will be done.  You will find herein a letter from Colo De Gainault who was taken with Genl. Lee. He complains of Ill usage & wants more money, hard money cannot be got here. We took infinite pains to Collect some for Genl Lee, appointed two Gentn to go round the City and declared the purpose it was intended for, but they cou'd not get sufficient to pay what Mr Morris borrowed to send Genl Washington. The answer generally given was that they had sent their money into the Country.(1)  We have the honor to remain, sir, your Obedt hble servants,  Robt Morris Geo Clymer P.S. We have procured the Steel & Rod Iron for Genl Schulyer & it will be sent immediately.(2)  ""

  Gentn . Philada Jany 28th . 1777 I have this day rec'd the enclosed letter from Mr. Bingham, & as our River now promises a speedy opening I shall send him a supply of News papers & intelligence.(1) It may also be proper that you do it from Baltimore and if you approve taking a person into pay for the purpose of Collecting News, News papers, Political Publications & writing a Diary of Public transactions I will try to find a fit person & engage him in this Work, so very necessary; for we find by experience it is impossible for Members of Congress to do these things regularly & constantly whilst they have so many other dutys to mind. I have recd the Copy of a letter from Mr. Deane that was taken but was preserved without the Captors ever coming at the Contents, it is as follows (2)--  \""Dr Sir Bordeaux Septr. 17. 1776 \""I shall send you in October Cloathing for Twenty thousand Men, thirty thousand Fusils, one hundred Tons of Powder, Two hundred Brass Canon, Twenty four Brass mortars with shell, shot, Lead &c in proportion.

The only doubt is whether, that Kings declaration & shutting up his Ports against us, will justify us in the Eyes of the World or in other Words, whether he has given us sufficient cause to declare War on him & his Subjects. If he has we shou'd not hesitate, the bait is tempting & that insignificant Nation can do us no harm. Our River is now nearly clear of Ice and I propose pushing out Captn. Biddle.(4) I do think we cannot employ him & the small Vessells better than to send them to Martinico for the Stores mentioned in Mr Ds letter, and I will send out the Indico now here as a remittance towards paying our Debts in that Island.  I have engaged a proper person to carry your dispatches to France & send him out in a French Ship that if she once gets out to Sea will appear as if She had loaded in Martinico & she is actually French property, which gives a fine chance of going safe.

  My dear Betsy Baltimore Jany 29th. 1777 Yesterday I had the Pleasure of receiving two Letters from you by the same hand, dated the 9th and 22d of December. And just now a Letter  JANUARY 29, 1777  is deliverd to me from my Friend Mr Bradford, dated the 13th of this Month, wherein I am informd that you was then in good Health and Spirits. If you had not told me that you had written to me Six Letters since I left Boston, I should have suspected that you did not keep a good Look out for Expresses which come this Way. I have now receivd only four of them. The others may possibly have fallen into the Hands of the Lords Protectors of America There is one Way in which you may probably make up the Loss to me, and that is by writing oftener. I assure you, it would not be troublesome to me to receive half a Dozen Letters from you at one Time.  You tell me you was greatly alarmd to hear that General Howe's Army was on the March to Philadelphia. I have long known you to be possessd of much Fortitude of Mind. But you are a Woman, and one must expect you will now and then discover Timidity so natural to your Sex. I thank you, my dear, most cordially for the Warmth of Affection which you express on this Occasion, for your Anxiety for my Safety and your Prayers to God for my Protection. The Man who is conscientiously doing his Duty will ever be protected by that Righteous and all powerful Being, and when he has finishd his Work he will receive an ample Reward. I am not more convincd of any thing than that it is my Duty to oppose to the utmost of my Ability the Designs of those who would enslave my Country; and with Gods Assistance I am resolvd to oppose them till their Designs are defeated or I am called to quit the Stage of Life.  I am glad to hear that the Winter has been in a remarkable Degree so favorable in New England, because it must have lessend the [. . .] (1) been increasd [. . .] (2) the Poor, is in holy Writ coupled with him who oppresses them. Be you warm and be you cloathd, without administering the necessary Means, is but cold Consolation to the miserable. I am glad you have given Shelter to Mrs A. who had not where to lay her Head. She deservd your Notice, and she has more than rewarded you for it in being, as you say she is, grateful. Whenever you see a poor Person grateful, you may depend upon it, if he were rich he would be charitable. We are not however, to seek Rewards in this Life, for Deeds of Charity, but rather imitate the all merciful Being, of whom, if I mistake not, it is said in Scripture, that he doth Good to the Evil and unthankful. There is indeed no such Thing as disinterrested Benevolence among Men. Self Love and social, as Pope tells us, is the same. The truly charitable Man partakes of the Feelings of the wretched wherever he sees the Object, and he relieves himself from Misery by relieving others.  I am greatly grievd for the Loss we have met with in the Death of Mr Checkley. From the Account you give me of the Nature & Extent of his Disorder, I conclude he must have died before this Time. He was indeed a valueable Relation and Friend. Have you lately heard from your Brother at St Eustatia?  We have no News here. The Events which take place in the Jerseys must be known in Boston before you can be informd of them from this Place. There is a Report that a Party of the Jersey Militia fell in with a larger Party of the Enemy, killed about twenty and took a greater Number Prisoners besides fifty three Waggons and Provisions. This is believd. It is also said that General Heath has taken Fort Washington. If it be so, we shall soon have the News confirmd.(3)  ""

  [January 29, 1777] I am now at the 29th Jany. without [having] had an oportunity to send away this very long Letter, our River having been full of Ice since the 9 or 10th Instt, however there is now an appearance of its becoming free again & several vessells will be pushing out altho the Men of war still Keep hovered above the Capes & I fear will do us much mischief [by] taking inward bound vessells-but this we cannot [help] unless France will send us a fleet of Line Battle ships & then we will teach him better manners. Genl. Washington still remains at Morris Town with his Troops cantoned or rather posted round Brunswick in such a manner as to teaze and [harrass] the Enemy extremely. They possess no other [parts] of New Jersey at this time, then Brunswick, Amboy & the Comunications between  JANUARY 30, 1777  them. When they want forage they are obliged to send out very large parties and always meet some Loss, in short never a Day passes but we take some prisoners, kill & wound some of their Men and our people have taken from them a Number of Wagons, horses, Cattle, sheep, Bagage &c. It is a sad thing to depend on [Militia] for the defence of a Country as we find by ex[perience] our people go out but for a short time & [by this means] Genl. Washington's army is eternally shifting some Joining and some Leaving him so that it is [hard for] him to know his own Strength and he must remain in this disagreeable Situation until the new enlistments are Compleated. Thank God they are going on very [fast] now, as our late Successes have given [new] springs to the Service. Genl. Howe has about [7000] Men at Brunswick & he has ordered a Reinforcement from Rhode Island where the New England Militia are collected ready to attack the Guards he shall leave there. Genl. Heath has marched down towards New York with this body of Militia & some few Regulars & taken Fort Independence with 400 Prisoners. We have reason to fear more he has retaken fort Washington and that we probably may expell the Enemy from New York. In short the face of things is totally changed, the spirit of the Whigs is up, the tories hide their heads, the money is regaining its Credit but not so essentially as it ought. This can only be effected by your procuring us the assistance of a fleet to protect our trade, and when we get plenty of goods the money will rise in volume as the prices decline. I have determined to send Capt. Thomas Bell to France for the purpose of delivering you a Letter from the Committee of Correspondence & this Letter also, the Newspapers for a Considerable time back. By him I write a Letter to my brother respecting the mode of employing Capt Bell after he has delivered his dispatches in which I hope for your Concurence & that you will become a party concerned.

  Sir, Baltimore Jany. 30th 1777. The Time of Congress, since my last, hath been principally taken up in devising Ways to prevent the Depretiation of the Continental Money, and to provide for the future Army. The Resolves ordered to be transmitted to the several States must have reached you before this, which renders it unnecessary to give the Substance or transmit Copies of them.(1)  Govr. Trumbull hath transmitted the Doings of the Committee of the New-England States to Congress. They will be taken up to Morrow, and I don't doubt approved.(2) JANUARY 30, 1777  A Letter sent by Mr. Jarvis to the Secret Committee respecting his furnishing our State and the Massachusetts with Arms taken out of the Hancock and Adams, and desiring to know whether they approved his Conduct or not, and how in the future he was to act in similar Instances, was by them laid before Congress a few Days ago. This brought on a severe Inquiry into the Propriety of Rhode-Island's asking for those Arms, a Review of her former Conduct respecting the Cannon &c &c as well as into the Propriety of the Conduct of Agent Jarvis. After a smart Storm, the Conduct of the Agent was approbated. I hope our State will take special Care that the Arms be returned as soon as the Necessity for taking them shall cease.(3)  Before this reaches you, you will have heard of the Success of our Arms at Princetown as well as Trenton. Our scouting Parties have since been successful in many Instances; the principal you will have in the inclosed Hand-Bill, which at the same Time gives an Account of the taking of Fort Independance &c, on which I heartily congratulate you. A Cannonading and Platoon firing was heard a few Days ago near Elisabeth Town, where a Detachment under Genl. Sullivan was posted. From some Circumstances I am induced to believe that our Detachment hath come off victorious I hope to hear of something clever from our State soon. Now is the Time to strike decisive Blows. The British Army are divided, and their Ardour is damped, and ours enhanced by our late Successes. It is a good old Proverb to strike while the Iron's hot, when it will yield to the Stroke. Our Affairs are in a fine Way at present, and if We do but push our Success the Contest will be decided this Winter; but if we should not embrace this golden Opportunity, Reinforcements will be sent over in the Spring, the War be protracted to the great Loss of the Lives and Properties of the Inhabitants of the United States. Therefore I will hope that the Troops collected in our State will not remain inactive this Winter, but exert themselves and make some capital Stroke on the Enemy.  I should be extremely glad to have an Assistant. I am afraid I shall be worn out by such a long continued attention. The Assembly I hope have chosen another Delegate. If they have I intreat that he may come on immediately; and I could wish for an Augmentation of Salary for Reasons I have already mentioned. Heartily wishing for a speedy Expulsion of the Enemy from our State. and for your Honor's Health and Prosperity I continue to be with great Esteem, your Honor's most obedient humble Servant.

  Sir Philada. Jany 30th. 1777  You will find herein a letter from the General (1) & sorry we are to find the report of the Capture of Fort Independance contradicted. It is surprizing that we shou'd be so much in the dark respecting what passes on the other side the North River. Flying reports of successes there, have come to Town this very day but seeing so many falsities are Circulated we shall not trouble you with them. We are amazed at what the General says respecting his Army. Militia are constantly fitting out & going from hence, what becomes of them afterwards w e dont know as the complaints for want of men Continue and we urge their being dispatched from hence all in our power. Colo Humpton is just come in from the Jersies & informs us that 3 to 400 Prisoners lately landed from New York at South Amboy are so weak & sickly that they cannot get along and the People on the Road are carting them to each others Houses to get the burthen of them from one to another. He adds that they perish for want of Physick & food having no officer to take the least care of them nor any money to purchase with. We sent for Doctr Shippen & have desired him to employ a proper person to go over & look after these poor Creatures and procure them such nourishment & succour as they may stand in need of, which we think Congress will approve of, as they wou'd not suffer those who have been fighting their battles to perish for want.  We shall send the General Copies of the Commissarys returns of military stores in this department agreable to the desire of the Board of War and give him such other information respecting Powder as we can.  A ship is arrived in this River with 8 to 9000 barrels of Salt from Cadiz. A letter of the 7th Novr. to Mr Morris says there is an appearance of a general Rupture in Europe, a fleet had sailed from Cadiz just before this ship and when the Captain comes up we shall probably get some further acot of it.

  Dear Sir, Baltimore January 30th 1777 It is with much pleasure I inform you that our affairs in the Jersies wear as favorable an aspect as we could possibly [hope fo]r. And if the militia remain with the General un[til the othe]r recruits get up, I verily believe the business of [the campaign] will be nearly finished for the] winter. Wonder[ful as it m]ay seem, yet it is fact that our great successes in Jersey since the 24th of Decr. have been obtained by an army chiefly irregular, and much inferior in number to the regular force of the enemy. JANUARY 30, 1777  And the Army that now so greatly and so ignominiously distress the British force at Brunswick is inferior in number to the one it now confines to the Brunswick hills. The Committee of Congress at Philadelphia tell us a report has come there of an engagement between Gen. Sullivans detatchment of the army near Brunswick and a strong detatchment of the enemy. The issue not certainly known but they say a person immediately from Brunswick relates that the British light horse came in much confusion from the field of battle to that Town calling for a reenforcement. We therefore hope hourly for good news from that quarter, nor are we without hopes of good accounts from N. York. We know they were in a very defenceless situation lately, and if the motions of Gen. Heath are not too slow, so that reenforcement may come from Rhode Island or be sent from Jersey for the defence of N. York, he will go near to free that City from the Tyrants Troops. We have no late news from Europe except by the way of Hallifax, where the report is, that a War between France & G. Britain is inevitable, and the B.

  Sir January 30th 1777 I have undoubted intelligence that there are not any men of war at the Capes indeed as an evidence of it a large Ship is come up the Bay, I therefore think it highly proper that you proceed to Sea immediately, and as you have now more men considerably than you had when I gave your last orders, I think proper to recall those and instead thereof you must observe the following Instructions.  You are first to make returns to the Board of Assistants of all the Stores in each department, that your Boatswain, Gunner and other officers may account for what is under their respective care and the same with provisions. Return also a compleat List of your officers and men on board, but as I would wish you not to loose one Moments time in getting out to Sea these returns can be made out as you go down and may be sent up from the Capes therefore you are to make the best of your way down the moment the Ice will permit, and I expect the Hornet and Fly will be in readiness to go down with you. If so you had best keep them ahead to look out. (Several Merchantmen will also go down with you, and you are to convoy them fairly off to Sea and keep with them for a few days if possible, soon as you find yourself fairly out at Sea, you will no doubt try the Ships Sailing and I expect she will perform wonderfully in that way, you will of course exercise your Men at the great guns, and prepare them for Action soon as possible.  The Marine Committee now at Baltimore have instructed Commodore Hopkins \""to fit out the two Continental Frigates Warren and Providence with all possible expedition, and to order them forthwith to proceed on a Cruize upon the enemies ships of war that are interrupting the commerce of the United States from the Harbour of Newport to the Capes of Virginia and they are to take, burn, sink, and destroy all such of the enemies Vessels as they shall fall in with.\"" (1) These are the Instructions for those Ships and therefore I think they must be proper for you and for your encouragement in this service I must observe that there are no Cruizing Ships an over match for you except the two Deckers, for altho you think JANUARY 30, 1777  you have not seamen enough yet that is just their case, except the Roebuck there is none of them halfmanned, therefore you have only to avoid two Deckers or engaging when there is more than one in sight. Any of their other single Ships you need not fear, especially if you can persuade your men to board, remember what a glorious exploit it will be, to add one of their frigates or 20 Gun Ships to our Navy, in a few days after you get out and if the Randolph has but Heels I think you can and will do it, you will then get seamen plenty. If your ships sails remarkably fast you may take libertys with them, If she does not be more cautious and try to find out her trim. I shall send a Copy of these Instructions to Congress and it is possible they may send fresh orders to you, which shall be lodged with Henry Fisher at Lewis Town, and the light House will be Ordered to shew a large white sheet when they have any orders for you and find a frigate in sight.(2)  Should any unfortunate accident befall you destroy these orders rather than let the enemy get them, and you will as opportunitys occur transmit us Accounts of your proceedings. You'l observe that many merchant Vessels are expected in with valuable Stores to this port, therefore you'l afford them all possible protection and had best keep in their tract as long as you can.  I wish you would send me signals by which you may be known, in case we should send out any of our small Cruizers to look for you, also to deliver to the other frigates that may go from hence Rhode Island &c. You will be careful of the Randolph, her Stores and Materials, kind to your officers and men, but observing Strict discipline, humane to your Prisoners, and send your prizes into safe ports.  With the best wishes for your Success I am Sir, Your obedt. sert, Robt Morris V. P.  ""

  Sir, Baltimore Jany. 30. 1777. If the tender Acquaintance I have with you will not justify the freedom I am about to take in recommending a young gentleman of distinguished merit to your patronage, I am sure a regard for the credit of your corps will excuse me. The young gentleman is a graduate of the New Jersey College, and is intimately acquainted with those branches of knowledge with [which] are connected with the Science of War. He possesses moreover JANUARY 30, 1777  military talents, has great industry & ingenuity, draws well, and has given proofs of real courage. He is now a third lieutenant in a company of Artillery, but has the Offer of a company of infantry from the State of Maryland. As his genius & inclination both mark him for the Artillery, he is willing to give up his offer of a company of infantry for a company of Artillery in your brigade. You will I am sure esteem him a great acquisition. I should have informed you before that his military talents receive great lustre from the purity of his morals, and from the agreeableness of his manners. He is a perfect little Gentleman. His name is Ebenr. Finley.(1) He is the third Son of the late Dr. Finley the president of the College of New Jersey.  Please to communicate the event of this application to me as soon as possible, and it shall immediately be communicated to Mr. Finley.  I am Sir with great esteem, your most Obedient, Hble Servt,  B.

The Enclosed paper contains our latest accounts from the army in New Jersy. This week we received by express a Copy of the resolutions of a Convention of Committees of the four New England States lately held at Providence. They have recommended Measures for Supporting the Credit of the Paper currency and for raising an army for defence of the State of Rhode Island. They have also recommended to the Assemblies to fix the prices of a number of Necessary Articles & have agreed on a farther bounty to encourage the Soldiers to inlist in the new army. The measures have been adopted by the Assembly of Connecticut. Congress has assigned to Morrow to consider them. A resolution passed to Day allowing Mr. Kirtland 444 2/5 dollars for his Salary as missionary to the Indians and a further Sum of 300 dollars for his extra Services and expences as Chaplain, and Indian Interpreter.

  Dear Sir, Baltimore, 31stJanuary, 1777. I have received your favour of the 17th instant, and am concerned to find that the appointment of Colo. Warner should give umbrage to any gentlemen in our State.(1) When it was moved in Congress, several objections were made to the motion; it was at length put to the vote, when a majority appeared to be for the question. This I can venture to assure you, that in all debates of this kind, Congress seems determined to put all disputes between individuals, and even between States, about property, out of sight; as debates of this kind the last year, between the States of Connecticut and Pennsylvania, took up the whole attention of Congress, to the great detriment of the service, and to but very little effect. I am well satisfied in my own mind, that Congress has not the least idea, as a collective body, of suffering any State to be dismembered, whatever the secret views of individuals may be. But permit me to say, that to leave our State so long unrepresented in Congress is a fault; when I observe to you that the four New-England States always keep a full representation; when, in some debates, those States may be injured who are not represented; Congress has often complained to me of this neglect, and indeed urged it in  JANUARY 31, 1777  Photographic reproduction of Goddard Broadside of the Declaration of Independence  their public resolves, but to no effect hitherto; I hope the Convention will speedily remedy this evil. I have for these six weeks past been the only member to represent our State in Congress. Let me beg you would make this known to the Convention, and believe me to be sincerely, Dear sir, Your very humb. servt. F. Lewis.  MS not found; reprinted from Journals of N.Y. Prov. Cong., 2:378.  1 The New York Committee of Safety was apprehensive that by appointing Col. Seth Warner, who was identified with the \""Green Mountain Boys,\"" to command a regiment in New York, Congress was encouraging the separatist aspirations of Vermont. On June 30 Congress emphatically denied that it had appointed Warner for this reason. Ibid., 1: 775-76; and JCC, 8:510.

  Dear Sir, Baltimore, 31st Jany. 1777. My last was of the 16th inst. to the Honourable the Convention, in answer to your favour of the 1st current. I therein advised the urgent necessity of sending a sufficient number of Delegates to represent our State in Congress; myself being the only member attending for above six weeks past, our State has been deprived of their vote on questions, in my opinion, of some consequence; and although Congress endeavours to avoid partiality as a collective body, yet it will imperceptibly steal into the minds of individuals, perhaps, without their thinking so. Permit me to observe that the four New-England States are always represented.  My last informed the Convention of the arrival of the armed sloop Montgomery, Capt. Rogers, with two prizes, vizt. a brigantine and schooner in this harbour. I have procured libels to be filed against both, and the 10th day of February was appointed for trial. I shall assist Capt. Rogers to obtain condemnation, but learn that the brigantine's cargo, consisting of about 3000 bushels of salt, will be claimed as the property of an inhabitant of this town. The schooner's cargo is valuable, and as some articles, vizt. cheese, &c. are perishable, I have obtained leave to land the cargo under the care of the Continental agent for this State. I am informed there is woollens sufficient to clothe a battalion, which I shall reserve until I receive the orders of Convention; there is also about 2400 sterling worth of fine Irish linen, much too fine for soldier's shirts; these I would advise to have sold here, together with such other articles not suitable for the troops, as they will in my opinion, yield a better price here than elsewhere, and the sailors will want money. I have advised Capt. Rogers to fit out his sloop for another cruise, as soon as possible. Should you order any of the articles to your State, they must be conveyed by land, as two English frigates with two tenders are lying at the capes. JANUARY 31, 1777  At foot you have an abstract of the schooner's cargo, collected from the cockets, the invoice being destroyed.  I have the honor to be, sir, Your obedt. humb. servt. F. Lewis Schooner Hannah's Cargo, vizt:  12 barrels and 10 half barrels of barley.  23 tierces, 26 barrels, 7 ankers, 25 firkins beef.  21 casks raisins, say 21 casks.  1 cask neats' tongues.  4 tierces and 19 barrels peas.  36 kegs pickled tripe.  5 firkins butter.  33 coils cordage.  15 hhds. beer.  30 bundles sheathing paper.  1 hhd. glassware.  4 cross cut saws.  1 puncheon and 1 barrel shoes.  7 bales woollens.  1 puncheon 2 boxes and 3 bales woolens.  1 bale osnaburgs.  6 bales and 33 loose bolts canvas.  1 barrel pork, 1 cask lampblack.  2 cases mustard, 1 box spices. 1 case buttons and trimmings.  1 case pickles, 3 chests Florence oil.  3 bundles twine.  112 cheeses, 1 keg nails.  50 hampers red port wine.  1 pack cinnamon.  2 boxes pipes, and a parcel of oakum.  N.B. Several of the woollens and linens being wet, it became necessary to open them.  Brigantine Minerva's Cargo.  3000 bushels salt, and 1 puncheon rum.  P.S.

  Sir Baltimore 31st Jany 1777  The Removal of Congress to this Place, & the Interruption occasioned thereby in the affairs of the Treasury, have prevented an early Reimbursement of the Money applyed for by the State of Massachusetts Bay. An Order was obtained at Philadelphia for £50,000 lawful, which with 300,000 Dollars for supplying the military Chest of the eastern Department, & payrnent of the Bounties to the new Levies of your State, will be sent from hence in about ten Days.(1) We have obtained an Order on the Loan Office at Boston for £50,000 in Addition to the Sums already mentioned, which will be sent by the president & compleats the £100,000 required by the State.(2) We are concerned to find that the Interest on the Certificates must continue at the Rate of 4 per Cent, being fully persuaded that this unreasonable Oeconomy will impede the Success of the Loan, & burthen the Continent with a greater Expence by the Depreciation that will result from further Emissions.  The Measures wisely adopted by the Convention of the New England States are transmitted to Congress by Governor Trumbull, & a Day is appointed for considering the same, when a similar Mode for giving Stability to the Currency will probably be recommended to the southern & middle Departments of the Continent.(3)  We think it necessary to suggest to the honorable assembly, that in Consequence of the Commission with which they have lately honored us, providing that \""any three or more\"" of their Delegates shall be present to make a Representation, the State has been several Days unrepresented & Congress has once been obliged to adjourn.(4) The Inconveniences from the first cannot be better stated than by mentioning, that the Question on raising the Interest of the Certificates was lost by the Indisposition of one of the Massa.

  Dear Sir Philada . Jany 31 st. 1777  I am exceedingly uneasy at a letter received last night from my Friend Mr. James Duff of Cadiz respecting my Brother. He tells me that he had regularly Corresponded with him from the time he arrived in Europe untill he went over to England & that from that time he never answered his letters altho they contained business of moment and I am likely to suffer considerably by the Neglect. He adds that his expences were growing very extravagant & in short gives me reason to suppose his Conduct is not right. Circumstanced as I now am with him You may suppose this gives me a most serious alarm. He had been Frolicksom & foolish many times as a Boy, but as I never knew him to depart from principles of honor & integrity in his wildest days, I never entertained a doubt of his becoming an excellent Character in the progress of his Manhood. These Considerations and the good accounts given of him by all my Friends in Spain & Italy induced me not only to commit to his care my own private business in which he is a partner, but to recommend him to the Superintendancy of the Public business as you will have seen heretofore and I know also that he has good mercantile abilities if he will but exercise them properly. However this letter from Mr Duff alarms me most exceedingly as it will make me most unhappy if the Public business shou'd have suffered by this appointment. I have hopes that on receiving my letters he wou'd instantly repair to France, consult you in all things and act under your guidance. If this shou'd be the case I shall be happy, if it is not, much shall I feel on the occasion, however I give you this notice of my alarm the moment I have received it that either his neglect & or abuse of the Trust reposed in him, if any there be, may be remedied the soonest that is possible and I am to inform you that the Secret Committee have agreed to join .Alderman William Lee Esqr, late of London, now supposed to be in France, with my Brother in this Commission. Therefore you can immediately give him Notice of it and letters authorizing him to Act will follow this immediately; at present there is not time for it, neither are the rest of the Secret Committee here. I have by this Conveyance wrote to my Friend Mr. John Ross of this place now in Europe (I expect in France) giving him a full account of this affair and authorizing him if he finds my Brother to have been faulty, immediately to get from him all letters & papers that regard the Public or my own business together with a Power of atty from my Brother to Act in his name & behalf until such time as a proper arrangement shall take place. Mr. Ross unluckily is a Scotch Man, but he is a Staunch American or I am much deceived. He was manv years my Neighbour. We have done a great deal of business together and I know him to be a capable steady merchant, regular and punctual, therefore I most cheerfully commit my own affairs to his guidance & the Public will benefit by any direction he may have in theirs. I recommend this Gentn  JANUARY 31, 1777  to your Friendship but as to Politics you'l use your own discretion in trusting him or not as he is from North of Tweed, but I am confident he is a fast Friend to the interest of this Country, indeed it is his own interest to be so. Shou'd Mr Ross be in France when you receive this he will do the needfull immediately; if he is not there you will take the proper care of all public effects untill he comes. .\t the same time I must flatter myself with the hope that my present fears are needless. This will be delivered you by Capt Thos Bell whom I have sent over with the Public dispatches to you (Gentn Commissioners) and herein you will find enclosed a letter directed to my Brother left open & dated the 29th Inst.(1) before I had any reason to doubt his Prudence. By this you will find I have procured Capt Bell a Commission for a Privateer & that my Friend Mr Jno Maxwell Nesbit is to be interested therein to the Amount of One Thousand pounds Sterling and myself to the same amount & that we proposed you & my Brother shou'd make up the rest of the concern to compleat such a Cruizer as you shou'd deem best calculated for success. If my Brother is doing what he ought to do and has your approbation to his Conduct he may still go on with this business. If the reverse Mr Ross can do it well or you may appoint any other person that you think proper, but as Capt Bell goes so long a Voyage for this purpose & you have encouraged the plan he must not be disapointed. I have Shipped some Tobacco by the ship he goes in consigned to Messrs. Pliarne, Penet & Compy with orders to sell it to the best advantage and to comply with your orders to the amount of One Thousand Pounds Sterling which is to pay for my interest in this Privateer. Mr. Nesbit says he has some bills but not enough for his share, he expects to have some money in my Brothers hand from a former consignment & he will send forward other effects soon to make it up. He is a Man of honor & Fortune and may be depended on, therefore do not let him be disapointed & to prevent it I have now directed that Messrs. Pliarne, Penet & Co shou'd Account with you for the whole net proceeds of 86 hhds of Tobo by this Ship which I hope will neat above £20 stg per hhd. If Mr Ross fits the Privateer you can transfer this order to him, if my Brother does it transfer it to him & if the whole is not wanted only take so much as is required leaving the remainder with Messrs Pliarne, Penet & Co for future orders. There are four hhds of Furs onboard this Ship also consigned to these Gentn. They are for Public account and the net proceeds to be remitted to you. Originally they were ordered to My Brother as well as the Tobacco but I have altered the orders to Messrs Pliarne.& Co without mentioning the cause. Youl observe that the Cargoes that have been dispatched from America for Europe consigned to the order of Mr. Thos. Morris have all been directed to Messrs. Pliarne, Penet & Co at Nantes, Messrs. Saml & J.H. Delap at Bourdeaux & one to Mr. Andw Limozin at Havre de Grace, unless he has fixed other agents in those & other Ports since he received his appointment. Therefore you can readily come at all that have arrived for if he has attended his duty he  will know and give acct thereof. If he has not the Cargoes & his letters must remain with the above Houses unless they have sent the letters & made the remittances to you, and in that case you will deliver all the letters that regard my Houses private Concerns to Mr Ross, also any money or effects that may have come into your hands in consequence of them. I put 100 hhds of Tobo. on their acct onbd the Ship Aurora from Virginia & 50 hhds onbd the ship Farmer, Capt Dashiel, from Maryld both for Nantes directed to Messrs Pliarne & Co. but Consigned to the order of Mr Thos. Morris. The rest of the Cargoes were on Public account. I hope to be relieved from this state of anxiety I am suddenly thrown into by the imprudence of one that I am very desirous of serving and have taken much pains to make a valuable good Man. God send he may yet turn out such. I beg my Compts to Doctr Franklin. I am impatient to hear of his safe arrival and shall be very happy w hen that good News reaches us. I am with sincere Regard & esteem Dr sir, Your affectionate Friend & Obedt hble servant, Robt Morris  P.S. If you have made any Commercial engagements in which I am interested you may depend on punctual compliance on my part and I shall push away remittances on Public Account fast as possible.(2)  ""

  Sir Philadelphia Jany. 31. 1777 All the Letters I have written you since we parted to this Date have been in that stile of Affection, which I was in hopes you would ever merit. Sorry I am indeed to suppose there is any Cause for Changing it & the only alleviation I can have of the trouble you now perplex me with, will be to find that your Conduct will be less blameable than at present I have reason to suppose. Your friend Mr. James Duff writes me the 1 7th Novr. that you had Corresponded with him regularly from the time you arived in Europe until your arival in London, but from that Period you had never answered his Letters, altho some of them were on business of Consequence respecting the Brig. Grenada Packet, Voyage which for aught I Know remains in that Port to this hour waiting for your Answer. He says also that you had nearly expended his Credit in your favour on Messrs. Herries & Co. for one thousand Pounds sterling & that they hinted to him you had beside other resources. These Circumstances & your total Silence to me, give me the most horrid presages of what I am to expect. Nevertheless it is possible that my friendly Letter, & the unlimited Confidence I repose in you, may have drawn forth the virtuous part of your Constitution into Exertion, & you may have stepped forth & done your Duty to the Public & to your friends; happy will it be for us both if you have but when I look the Contrary way the Picture shocks all my feelings & I cannot bear it. Your follies as a boy I always forgave, expecting one day to see you despise them, & reap the fruits of your Abilities; but if you have introduced them into the European World in the Character of man and a merchant, I fear it will all be over & that your future prospects must be Gloomy indeed. This goes under Cover to my friend Mr. Jno. Ross, whom I have requested to join you immediately after the recipt of it, to examine strictly into your Conduct & if he finds you have either abused or neglected your Duty in the Public or Private Trusts I have reposed in you, that he should immediately receive from you all the Public & Private Letters you have received from me, from our House, from the Secret Committee, or from any other Persons in consequence of the business you have been charged with and I now strictly Charge & injoin you to deliver them all up to him & to grant him a Power of Attorney to act & do what may be right in all those affairs JANUARY 31, 1777  that have been Committed to you. I desire you will deliver him up all the moneys, or Effects that you have in Hand of ours, my W. M. Co., or mine & the accounts, Bonds, Bills or Notes of those with whom you have deposited any part thereof & I also desire that you will write Letters to our Several Correspondants in England desiring them to settle their accounts with him instead of you, informing them that you are about to return.

  My Dear Friend Philadelphia Jany. 31st. 1777 I have now the unhappiness to address you on a subject that distresses me exceedingly. You may probably be acquainted with the cause, but Twas not until last night, when I recd. a Letter from our Mutual friend Mr. James Duff of Cadiz informing me that my Brother had regularly Corresponded with him until he arrived in London, & from that time he never Answered his Letters, although they were wrote in the Warmest stile of Friendship, & one of them Contained particularly some matters of business, respecting the Voyage of the Brigt. Grenada Packet waiting at Cadiz for his reply which he never gave. He adds that his Expences had Amounted to near 21000 Sterling taken up on the Credit he had given him & that besides this Messrs. Herries on whom he drew seemed to think he had other resources, & it seems all our Correspondents have complained they could never see him. These are alarming Circumstances, to which I may add my not having heard from him since he left Marseilles altho I have seen those that saw him in London, & frequently heard of him. His Letters from Cadiz, Gibralter & Marseilles with the good accounts given of him by all our friends in that quarter, induced me to believe he had discarded all his follies, & I determined to win him to the pursuit of his own good, by placing an intire Confidence in him. I do not even now entertain any doubts of his integrity, but if his weakness is so prevalent, that no dependance can be had on him, I must 'een get him back here & let him go into our Army. My dependance is now upon you my good friend; wherever you are when you receive this Letter, I beg you will Post away immediately to him. If he be in France examine into his Conduct to the  JANUARY 31, 1777  very bottom, and if you find he has received my sundry Letters & those of the Secret Committee, examine Closely what he has done in Consequence of them. Should you find those Letters have brought him to a proper Sense of his Duty, & that he is acting as he should do, then Confirm him in the Practice of it, but if on the Contrary you find he has in this neglected or abused the Trust I have reposed in him either Public or Private, in such Case deliver him the inclosed Letter of this date & oblige him to deliver you all the Letters I have wrote to him both public & Private. Let him also give you a Power of Attorney to act in all those affairs in his Stead, or on his behalf. Get from him all the Money or Effects he has whether Public or private & send him Home to me by the first Conveyance that you think safe. Should he have been led into this foolish Conduct by the Apprehensions of blame for having spent too much money, I can readily overlook that, provided he has since discharged his Duty to the Public & to our House, of which you will be able to judge & must Act accordingly. But even in that Case I wish you to remain in France, and either join him in the Prosecution of such business as I shall procure for you, or else send him here, where he can be exceedingly useful to me, & you act for him in all things until I can arrange matters properly in Consequence of this very heavy disappointment. I shall mention my fears to Mr. Deane & if you are not in France will desire him to take Care of the Public affairs, but Ours, W.M. & Co. I rely on you altogether for, and am Dear Sir, Your Affectionate Humb Servt. Robt. Morris  P.S.

We are told here the Troops have left Rhode Island & burnt Newport. How true this I do not know, but it is Certain they had embarked part of the Troops there before a Mr McCleary lately from thence came away, wherefore I expect it will soon be known where they are to reinforce.

Putnams Force at Prince Town was too Sanguine I will mention it again and be governed by their orders for I confess I think such JANUARY 31, 1777  removal at this time woud have a bad effect & retard many usefull operations.(1) I take the Liberty to enclose you the Copy of a letter from Hugh Wallace Esqr of New York to Mr Nesbitt here and hope it may be in your Excellencys power to Save his property for altho he has the misfortune to differ from us in Politics yet if he does not take an active part I conceive it is not right to Confiscate his property. I do [not?] know any such instance hitherto. Here are Capt Jones & several other people in this City that want to go into New York. I wish they was there for they poison our peoples minds daily. I think it best to send Jones in on parole because Capt Hamond sent up Capt Hallock of the Lexington on those terms & if Your Excellency thinks proper I will propose an exchange between those two. The other persons we don't hold as prisoners being taken in Merchantmen but I wou'd put them all under parole & send them by Crosswix to South Amboy & let them Cross from thence. I think it can do no harm, & they do much mischief here. Amongst the Number is also Mr. Palmer Commissary of Provisions &c under Mr Chamier who will get in Exchange a Capt Deane asked for by the Councill of Safety or any other you please to Name, or return back. I have a Ship arrived in our Bay with 10000 bushels of Salt but unfortunately she is run aground. I am sending down assistance & hope to Save her. By her I got King George's Speech & you Will find a Copy enclosed.(2) I have no doubt of a Rupture in Europe this next Summer & his Majesty seems to entertain some doubts about it. With the warmest Wishes for Your Success I am sir Your obedt Servt.  Robt Morris P.S. I laid your letter respecting the arms &c delivered to associators before the Council of Safety & your plan must be adopted.  You will please to receive herewith Mr Commissary Towers's returns of Arms & Ammunition & we will Continue to furnish you with them.  ""

  Dear Sir Philada. Jany 31st. 1777 Do not blame me for letting so much time elapse before I reply to your favour of the 14th Inst. for I have many good reasons to plead in excuse but one insurmountable one may suffice; I really cou'd not do it. Agreable to your desire I have considered the plan of the office you propose and the first view convinced me of its utility, but here am I a very slave, far from Baltimore and consequently unable to promote what I wish, for it  JANUARY 31, 1777  is a subject that will not do for a Public letter. When I shall join the Congress, or when they will return here is quite uncertain but this you may assure yourself that my judgement approves the plan & my Friendship prompts me to comply with your wishes and if it ever lies in my power I will most readily convince you of this truth. I think Hooper wou'd be a proper hand to broach this plan and if Jay & Johnston attended the Congress they shou'd back it. This may happen before long and I shall rejoice to see it, for I am told our assembly do not intend you shall be in the New List of Delegates.(1) I am too busy to attend or I wou'd Contest the matter warmly altho I well know, that the Honesty, merit & ability which you possess in so eminent a degree wou'd not be sufficient pleas against the previous determination of a Strong party for that I am told is the case.

  My dearest Julia, Baltimore Januy 31 1777. This is the 4th letter I have written to you since my Arrival in this place. I have received One from You which gave me great pleasure. In my former letters I gave you a general Acct. of my Situation. I shall now add to it, that after spending a week in the house of a Mrs. Orrick in a room formerly occupied by Mr Seargeant I was obliged to look out for other lodgings upon Mr. Seargeants return. I am now very comfortably situated with a Mrs Payne. Mr Seargant was so much pleased with my landlady and the accommodations which her house afforded that he has left his old quarters, and now lodges with me. There are a number of boarders in the family. One of them is a young French Officer. His history in one particular is very remarkable. He is one of one & twenty children, 18 boys & three girls. They were all born of the same father & mother, and are all now living. Happy family! I shall be better satisfied if the same can be said [of] me as was said of the prophet of old \""That I walked in the fear of the Lord, and begat sons & daughters,\"" than if it were inscribed upon my tombstone that I governed the counsels, or commanded the arms of the whole continent of America. JANUARY 31, 1777  Every article of provision-cloathing and the common conveniences of life are 100 percent higher in this place than in Philadelphia. I pay 50/ a week for my board, and 2/6 a day for my horse. I cannot reconcile these prices with the plenty of provisions for man & beast with which this part of the country abounds. The market contains besides the ordinary provisions found in the Philada. market a great variety of fish and wild fowl.  The town of Baltimore contains about 1000 houses-most of them large & built with brick. It is divided into two parts distant from each Other about 3/4 of a mile. Both divisions are situated upon Petapsco river about 15 miles above Chesapeak bay. The water of the river is a good deal Brackish, and even the water of the pumps & wells in the town is not wholly free from a Saltish taste. The town used to contain near 5000 inhabitants before the present war. You will be surprised when I add to this account of Baltimore that the first house in it was built not more than 30 years ago. It has for some years past vied with Philadelphia in commerce, and bids fair for being the most wealthy spot on the continent.  I expect to set off tomorrow to pay a visit to Dr Howard an old fellow student of mine in the College of Edin[burgh].(1) He lives 15 miles from this place. I have as yet contracted no acquaintances with the inhabitants of the town. I associate only with delegates, & attend only to the business of the congress.  I forgot to inform you before that when the acct. came to the congress of your Papa's harsh treatment by General Howe, they immediately ordered General Washington to remonstrate against it, and to threaten to inflict similar indignities upon some tory prisoners.  My pen and paper are intollerable. I hope to write to you more fully by the next post. Love to all Mr Montgomery's family. Adieu my dearest- yours-yours-yours, B Rush  ""

  My dear Sir Baltimore Feb 1st 1777 The Proceedings of the Committees of the four New England States have been read in Congress, and are now under the Consideration of a Committee of the whole. They are much applauded as being wise and salutary.(1) I had heard that one of your Delegates at that Convention had written a long Letter to his Friend and Confident here; and hearing it whisperd, that the Massachusetts State had disapprovd of those Proceedings, I was led to ask the Gentleman who had receivd the Letter, concerning it.(2) He confirmd it; and said, that not only the Trade, but the  FEBRUARY 1, 1777  Landed Gentlemen in the House of Representatives were sanguine against it. I beggd him to let me see his Letter; but he refusd in a kind of Pet, telling me it was a private Letter. I was left to conjecture, whether I had been really impertinent in asking a Sight of his Letter, or whether the Contents of it were such as it was not proper for me to see. You will easily conceive what a Scituation one must be in here, who having receivd no Intelligence himself, of the Sentiments of his Constituents, is obligd in vain to ask of another, upon what Principles they have disapprovd of a Measure (if indeed they did dissapprove of it) upon which he is called to give his own Opinion. But it is difficult to account for means peevish humors, and it is generally not worth ones while to attempt it. You see, my Friend from this Instance, the Necessity of your writing to me oftener. When I was told upon the forementiond Occasion, that I would be intitled to see the Letters of Another; whenever I should be disposd to communicate those which I receive my self, I could have said truly that I had scarcely receivd any. Two only from you in the Space of near four Months. But I have no Claim to your Favors, however much I value them, unless perhaps upon the Score of my having not neglected to write to you by any opportunity. Your omitting of late even to acknowledge the Receipt of my Letters, I might indeed construe as a silent Hint that they were displeasing to you. But I will not believe this till I have it under your own Hand.  While I am writing, your very acceptable Letter is brought to me by Mr Lovell.(3) You therein speak, as you ever have done, the Language of my Soul. Mr Adams tells me you are President of the Board of War; I am therefore induced to recall what I have just now said, which you may construe as an implied Censure for your not having written to me oftener. I am sure you must have a great Deal of Business. I am not sorry for it, for a Reason which I need not mention. I pray God to preserve the Health of your Body and the vigor of your Mind. We must chearfully deny our selves Domestick Happiness and the Tranquility of private Life when our Country demands our Services.  Give me Leave to hint to you my opinion, that it would be a Saving to our State in the Way of Supplys, if the Board of War would consign the Cargoes which they order here to a Mercht of good Character rather than to the Masters of the Vessels. Possibly there may be some Exceptions. But I have Reason to think that a Cargo which arrivd about a Fortnight ago, consisting as I am told, chiefly of Rum and Sugar which were scarce Articles, was sold at least 30 per cent under what it would have fetchd, if it had been under the Direction of a Person acquainted in the Place, and Flour is purchasing by the Person who bo't the Cargo, and I suppose expects an Allowance therefor, at an unlimitted Price. I am perswaded, if you had by a previous Letter directed a Cargo to be procured, you might have had it 20 per cent cheaper. If the Board should be of my Mind, I know of no Gentlemen whom I would more freely recommend than Mess  Samuel and Robert Purviance. They are Merchants of Character, honest and discrete Men and warmly attachd to our all important Cause. But I get out of my Line when I touch upon Commerce. It is a Subject which I never understood. Adieu my dear Friend. Beleive me to be yours,  S A P.S. I forgot to tell you that, a fair occasion offering, I movd in Congress that the Eldest Son of our dearest Freind Genl Warren might be adopted by the Continent & educated at the publick Expence. The Motion was pleasing to all & a Come is appointed to prepare a Resolve. Monuments are also proposd in Memory of him & Genl Mercer whose youngest Son is also to be adopted & educated.(4) But these things I would not have yet made publick.(5)  ""

  Sir Baltimore in Maryland 1st Feby. 1777 As we shall write you shortly again our attention at present will be confined chiefly to your favor of Decemr. 6th 1776, in which you mention the misconduct of Capt. Patterson. We have laid your letter before Congress, and they have appointed a Committee to consider of the most proper steps to be taken in this business, that speedy and condign punishment may be applied to Captn. Patterson, when his crime shall be duly enquired into & established, The Congress having an utter abhorrence of all irregular & culpable violation of the law of nations, and that friendship & respect, which they entertain for the French Nation. We wish you would communicate this to their Excellencies the Governor & General of Martinique.(1) Congress has referred the matter of remittance for discharge of the obligation you & Mr. Harrison have entered into, to the State of Maryland, from whence you will no doubt receive remittance as soon as the British Ships of War now in Chesapeake Bay will permit. It is a singular misfortune to us, and very injurious to the Commerce of France, that we have not two or three line of Battle of Ships, which, with our Frigates and armed Vessels would keep open our navigation in despite of Great Britain, but at the present, one heavy Ship affords protection to two or three Frigates, that would otherwise be easily removed, and they place themselves so as to shut up the entrance into our principal trading States.  Prior to the Declaration of Independence, as it was not certain how soon our quarrel with Great Britain might be at an end, our Armies were enlisted for short periods, and Genl. Howe having received information FEBRUARY 1, 1777  of the time, when the Troops would have it in their power to go home, seized that opportunity of marching through the Jersies. But his Career was stopt at the Delaware, and he has since paid severely for that visit. Since the 24th Decemr. the enemy have lost more than 2000 Men in killed & made Prisoners.  They have been obliged to recal their Troops from Rhode Island to defend New York from the attack of an army under Genl. Heath, and their whole forces in the Jersies is now collected on the Brunswick Heights, where they are nearly surrounded by General Washington's Army, and where they are greatly distressed for forage, fuel, and other necessaries.  They are mouldering away by deaths, desertions & captivity so that we hope to give a good account of this part of their army, before the Winter is over.

His Majesty gives no such assurance this year of Peace as he did the last but rather seems to think it necessary to be prepared for War at Home.(1) I am sorry to add the ship with Salt is on shoar in our Bay.  The Board of War have given us their opinion that the Public Stores shou'd not be removed from hence, but this opinion being founded on  FEBRUARY 1, 1777  intelligence of the Numbers with Genl Putnam that exceeded greatly the reality we Still wish for further orders on this respect. We have no further advices from the Camp, since our last letter & therefore continue in opinion ourselves that it wou'd be impolitic to remove them untill some event shall point out more Strongly a necessity for doing it, however the orders of Congress Shall be implicitly obeyed. We have recd. 200,000 Dollars & lodged it with Mr Commissary Mease.(2) The paymaster Genl. Mr Palfrey has drawn on us for near 30,000 of it already not knowing of the sum gone forward to the Camp.

The dangerous Nature & Tendency of this Insurrection, require that the most vigorous and effectual Measures be immediately taken to suppress it. I am therefore to request you will comply with the enclosed Resolves of Congress for this End. Should the Exertions of your Militia FEBRUARY 1, 1777  be apprehended to be ineffectual, the Congress on your representing the Matter to them, will readily order any additional Assistance that shall be thought necessary.(1)  I have wrote to Genl.

It will be a very fortunate Point, and contribute greatly to the Tranquility of that Country, should you be able to apprehend the Leaders of this Faction, and secure them agt. any similar attempts for the future.  The Flames of Rebellion may be easily extinguished by spirited & timely Exertions at first-but if suffered to spread, the Work will become more difficult and hazardous. It is therefore highly necessary that your Movements should be as quick & as secret as possible; and from your Zeal in Behalf the American Cause and the Repose of your Country now disturbed by the Insurrection of her Enemies, I have no Doubt of your exerting yourselves in a becoming Manner on this Occasion.

  My dear Sir Baltimore February 1. 1777 It was with singular pleasure I read your two last very friendly letters,(1) and long before this I had gratefully acknowledged the receipt of them, if I had not met an insuperable obstacle in a fever which at this moment locks me up in my Chamber. After an Illness of several days an Impatience to be in Congress drew me out in a very wet day. The Consequences were what any man in his senses might have expected, a Relapse, & had I not been fortunate in a Physician I perhaps had been measuring my length and breadth under ground a situation bad enough indeed, but bad as it is surely preferable to being above it for any time in this worst of all possible places. I am now recovering, & God willing propose moving southward in a few days.(2) Nelson by advice of a Physician goes to morrow, He is in a bad state of Health. Harrison is still ill & unless he is more attentive to Exercise & Regimen I fear the consequences will be serious. With one united voice we ascribe this Catalogue of Ills to this place. I declare to you the Congress presents such a scene of yellow death like faces, that you wou[ld] imagine Rhadamanthus (3) had shifted his quarters & was holding Court in Baltimore. I believe were it the case he would soon be glad to get back to his friend Pluto's regions. I have eased my Stomach. When Fancy is exhausted in blackness of description, when you are disposed to abuse my Carolina spare every figure of Rhetorick & compare it to Baltimore.  I congratulate you upon the new face which our affairs have assumed in the Jersies under every difficulty that a military genius could possibly have to struggle with. General Washington sometimes almost without an army, at best with one composed of raw undisciplined troops, impatient of Command & vastly inferiour in numbers to the Enemy, has been able to check a victorious army, with every thing that could afford a probability of Success, thundering at the very gates of the Capital of America, to change their Course, & is now pursuing them in turn to the only spot which they have possession of in America. Will Posterity believe the Tale? When it shall be consistent with policy to give the history of that man from his first introduction into our service, how often America has been rescued from ruin by the meer strength of his genius, conduct & courage encountering every obstacle that want of money, men, arms, Ammunition could throw in his way, an impartial World will say with you that he is the Greatest Man on Earth. Misfortunes are the Element in which he shines, They are the Groundwork on which his picture appears to the greatest advantage. He rises superiour to them all, they serve as foils to his fortitude, and as stimulants to bring into view those great qualities which in the serenity of life his great modesty keeps concealed. I could fill the side in his praise, but anything I can say cannot equal his Merits or raise your Idea of them. FEBRUARY 1, 1777  I lament, my dear Sir, the very small representation which America presents in Congress. The members will soon be reduced to the number of 22, how unequal to the importance of its councils! I am sorry to say that I think they already savour of the truth of an Observation contrasted to that in holy Writ \""That in the multitude of Counsellors there is Wisdom.\"" Some of the middle and Southern colonies have much to answer for in their want of representation. It is a Crime however which carries its own punishment with it, & if there are two Interests in America, that must necessarily prevail which always has its advocates on the spot to promote it, while the other is deserted by those whom every tie of honour, Duty & publick virtue should induce to a different conduct. New York, Delaware, Maryland may almost as well desert the Cause as so lamely support it by their appearance in its publick Councils.(4) I have the next delegation of your State much at heart & should be very sorry that any change should take place to the exclusion of Wilson. He is a Character some what particular, but after a long and pretty intimate acquaintance with him I am extremely deceived, if pure Integrity & love to America, a just and generous Attachment to the State which he represents, a strong natural Capacity improved by extensive reading & retentive memory where cool Judgment has matured & digested what he has read are not the genuine Characteristicks of my friend Wilson. His removal from Congress in my opinion would work an essential political Evil. Ross has I think acted unexceptionably. Now and then He takes a whimsical turn, perhaps a wrong one, but to do him Justice he does not persist in it. He is too much of a Character not to be excentric. He is a sincere friend to the Cause & I think is independent in his Notions. Pardon this intrusion into internal local policy; I have the publick good in view which must prove my Apology.  I am much pleased with our Success against the foraging party, & the more so from General Dickinson having had the Command. He has laid up a kind of Reputation as a patriot & an officer which will be sufficient not only for himself for life but upon which his Brother the Farmer may make draughts to repair that loss of Credit into which a constitutional weakness of nerves has betrayed him & in which I sincerely believe his heart had no share.  What is the Policy of quartering Soldiers upon the Inhabitants of your City. Was not this one of the great evils which the bill of Rights was intended to remedy in the executive power of the British Constitution. Was it not a grievance that we clamoured loudly against when Subject to G.B. I wish it may not lead to reflections injurious to our Cause & give disaffected men reason to complain who have hitherto growled without it, & have in vain wrecked their Inventions to sully our glorious Cause and call forth the Censure of the World upon those who support it. I would not wish wantonly to sport with man's feelings. There will be a time & I hope it is not at a great distance when the distinction of Whig & Tory  FEBRUARY 2, 1777  will be lost & resolve itself into the common Appellation of Citizens of the Indept States) all political grudges will die away & harmony & happiness cement the whole. I wish that no wounds may be made among ourselves that time & common Interest may not at last heal. In so great a Convulsion Sacrifices must be made but it has been the policy of every wise Legislator to found the Change of Government in lenity & forbearance. I have been led to this out of the way Speculation, from having heard that your Council of Safety had barracked Soldiers upon your Citizens & Trusted the execution of it to Melchor. I know your feelings will help me to an excuse for thus trespassing again upon Internal policy. I wish some expedient could be fallen upon to put our monied matters in a proper train. The demands upon us at present are immense & must continue so, like beginners in every thing else we want Oeconomy or rather want System. Unless officers are appointed competent to the management of our funds, we must be ruined. From a false parsimony in saving hundreds in salaries of proper Officers we are sporting away Millions in the want of them. I wish the Loan Office may suceed at 4 per Cent. The Southern Colonies will not consent to raise it. They consider the Eastern Governments as in possession of almost all the Continental Currency, & the rise to (5) as only a prelude to a higher demand & that in proportion to our necessities.5 But I have already trespassed too far upon your patience & proved to you perhaps that my Head has had its share of my fever. I will trouble you no farther than to say I shall be happy to hear from you while I am in Carolina, & to assure you on paper which I hoped to have done in person before I left this part of the Continent that Absent or Present I am & shall ever remain Your's with the truest Affection, Wm Hooper  ""

My Horses performed extremely well.  Baltimore is a very pretty Town, situated on Petapsco River, which empties itself into the great Bay of Cheasapeak. The Inhabitants are all FEBRUARY 2, 1777  good Whiggs, having sometime ago banished all the Tories from among them. The Streets are very dirty and miry, but every Thing else is agreable except the monstrous Prices of Things. We cannot get an Horse kept under a Guinea a Week. Our Friends are well.  The continental Army is filling up fast, here and in Virginia. I pray that the Massachusetts may not fail of its Quota, in Season.  In this Journey, We have crossed four mighty Rivers, Connecticutt, Hudson, Delaware, and Susquehannah. The two first We crossed upon the Ice, the two last in Boats-the last We crossed, a little above the Place where it empties into Cheasapeak Bay.  I think I have never been better pleased with any of our American States than with Maryland. We saw most excellent Farms all along the Road, and what was very striking to me, I saw more sheep and more flax in Maryland than I ever saw in riding a like Distance in any other State.

  Honble. Gentlemen Baltimore 2 Feby. 1777 You will receive inclosed copies of our letters of the 21st and 30th Decemr., and of the Resolves of Congress accompanying them. It concerns us not less than we are sure it will you, that you should have heard so seldom from us, but the vigilance of the British Cruisers has prevented our most earnest solicitude for this purpose. The manner in which they now conduct their business proves the necessity of the request made by Congress for the loan or sale of a few Capital Ships. The entrance into Delaware & Chesapeak being narrow, by placing one 40 or 50 Gun Ship for the Protection of their Frigates, they stop both our Commerce & our Correspondence. Formerly their Frigates protected their Tenders, but now that we have Frigates, their larger Ships protect their Frigates; and this winter has been so uncommonly favourable that they have been able to keep the sea undisturbed by those severe gales of wind so usual off this Coast in the winter season. If we had a few line of Battle of Ships to aid our Frigates, the Commerce of North America so beneficial to ourselves & so advantageous to France, would be carried on maugre the opposition of Great Britain. As we have not received any of those military Stores &  FEBRUARY 2, 1777  Cloathing promised by Mr. Deane, ue have much reason to fear they have fallen into the Enemie's Hands and will render a fresh supply quite necessary. Except Mr. Deane's favor of Septemr. 17th which is but just now received, and that of October the 1st, we have not heard from him since the summer, so that we have been as destitute of European, as we fear you have been of true American Intelligence.(1) The inclosed papers will furnish you with authentick accounts of our successes against the enemy since the 24th of Decemr. They have paid severely for their visit of parade through the Jerseys, and these events are an abundant proof of British Folly in attempting to subdue North America by force of arms. Although the short inlistments had dispersed our Army directly in the face of an hostile force, and thereby induced a proud enemy to suppose their work was done, yet they suddenly found themselves attacked on all sides by a hardy active Militia, who have been constantly beating up their quarters, captivating and destroying their Troops, so that in the six or seven last weeks they have not lost much fewer than 3000 Men, about 2000 of whom, with many Officers, are now our Prisoners. Instead of remaining cantonned in the pleasant Villages of Jersey, as the inclosed authentick copy of Mr. Howe's order to Coll. de Donop (the original of which fell into our hands by the Colonel's flight from Burdenton) will shew you, that General vainly expected would be the case, they are now collected upon the Brunswick Heights, where they suffer every kind of distress from want of Forage, Fuel, and other necessaries, whilst Genl. Washington's Army of Militia so environs them, that they never shew their faces without their lines, but they get beaten back with loss and disgrace. Being thus situated, we have reason to hope, that this part of their Army (and which is the most considerable part) will by the end of winter be reduced very low by deaths, desertion, & captivity. Genl. Heath, with a body of Eastern Troops, is making an impression on New York by King's Bridge, which we understand has obliged the Enemy to recal their Troops from Rhode Island, for the defence of that City.  The regular Corps, that are to compose the new Army, are making up in the several states as fast as possible; but Arms, Artillery, Tent Cloth, & Cloathing will be greatly wanted. For these our reliance is on the favor & friendship of his most Christian Majesty. If you are so fortunate as to obtain them, the propriety of sending them in a strong Ship of War must be very evident to you Gentn. when you know, our Coasts are so covered with British Cruisers from 20 to 50 Guns, though but few of the latter. We believe, they have not more than two Ships of 40, and two or three of 50 Guns in their whole Fleet on the North American Station; and these are employed, one of them to cover a Frigate or two at the Capes of each Bay, whilst the rest remain at New York.  We beg leave to turn your attention to the inclosed propositions of Congress, and we doubt not you will urge their success with that zeal &  careful assiduity, that objects so necessary to the liberty & safety of your Country demand.  We are exceedingly anxious to hear from you, and remain with particular sentiments of esteem & friendship, Honble Gentlemen, Your most obedt & huml Servts.

  My Dear Bror. No.1 Baltimore 2d Feby 1777 I now acknoledge the receipt of your Several favors. One of the 28 Decr. was handed me the l9th Jany. by Mr. Betten, one of the 12th Novr. & another of 23 Decr came to hand the 26th Ulto. & one of 8th Jany by FEBRUARY 2, 1777  Mr Lovell I receiv'd last evening. I have been thus Perticular that you may know if any Miscary, for which purpose I shall in future persue your method in numbering my letters, & 'tho have wrote you two or three before shall call this No. 1. You seem to lament the loss of Forts Washington, & Lee, I only lament that our Genl. shod attempt to hold those posts. When I came through the army, the intention was to evacuate them, but some strange infatuation it seems afterwards alter'd the wise determination, however I am inclin'd to think we shall loose nothing by it in the end. As to the retreat thro' New Jersey, I am convinced it was ordered by Providence for our advantage, for no measures that could have been taken by us, wod so effectually secure to our interest the inhabitants of that Country; as the Ravages committed by the Enemy, some accots. of which will soon be published. I have seen a letter in the hand writing of the Tyrants dispencer of Pardons, to one of his Hessian Butchers directing him to seize all Provisions whereever he could find it leaving only what in his opinion shod be sufficient for an ordinary Family, which his agent faithfully observed, for after plundering every thing that he could carry off & destroying what he cod. not carry off, he gave them Protections for themselves, Properties, that being in his opinion sufficient for an ordinary family. No doubt he knew his masters will. It was given out in General orders that if a man was found with a gun in his hand not having an officer with him, he shod be immediately hung up, so if a poor fellow was to go in search of a Squiril or Partrige for his dinner after being plunder'd of all his Provision & shod be so unfortunate as to fall in with any of these plunderers he is to be hung up on the first tree. This is British Humanity; this is the treatment that all America wod have experienced had they submitted to the Yoak of the Tyrant, nay much worse must have been expected if we are to judge from their conduct to those People that have been in their Power, for Rapes, murders, & every other Species of Cruelty that these worse than Barbarians have exercised on the poor inhabitants, Beggers all discription.  I am very glad to hear that there is an imbargo on Privateers, as I think it may be productive of good consequencies, but cannot think with you that there shod be a total stop put to this Business.(1) The authority of the several states may do it, as they find the exegency of affairs require it, but it will by no means do for Congress to undertake that Business. We must be very careful not to put more Power in the hands of Congress than is absolu[te]ly necessary, for the good of the whole we shod always bare in mind, the natural fondness that all mankind have for Power, & therefore shod deal it out as sparingly as possible. It gives me great Pleasure to find your public Business goes on so smoothly. I hope you'll have some Salutary Laws for the Punishment of Traitors. It is high time that was done for our internal Enemies do us much more mischief than all the force that Great Britain can bring against us. A strong oath of allegience to the state shod be administer'd to every person in the least  FEBRUARY 3, 1777  suspected, abjuring the authority of the King & Parliament of Britain or any other power not deriv'd from the People. When these measures are taken & the Laws faithfully executed we shall soon have things in a good way. Affairs abroad wear a very favorable aspect, we are in daily Expectation of very interesting Intelligence from our Commissioners at the French Court & I hope it wont be a great while, before we hear from those at some other Courts, but these are matters that you must be very carefull who you trust with for the Present. Measures are taking by Congress & I hope will be taken by every state to give stability to the Currency. Congress seem more firmly united than ever, & I am sensible the Removal from Philadelphia has a very good effect, 'tho I by no means approv'd of it at the time. I think on the whole our affairs look well, the Principle object is to raise the new Army, that being compleated & proper measure taken for the Security of our Trade, we shall be in a scituation, under the Smiles of Heaven, to Establish Liberty, & Happiness.  J. L. writes that he shall put some Business into your hands, which I suppose he has done before this time.(2)  Dr. Brackett has favor'd me with a letter (which I receiv'd only a few days ago tho it is dated 2d Decr) which I shall answer soon but believe shall not be able by this opportunity. Give my very affecte Regards to all Friends & perticularly commend me to our Mother who I hope injoys as much health & Happiness as her advanc'd age will admit off. I am You very Affecte Bror.(3) Wm Whipple  ""

  Baltimore Feby. 3. 1777 This Day has been observed in this Place, with exemplary Decency and Solemnity, in Consequence of an Appointment of the Government, in Observance of a Recommendation of Congress, as a Day of Fasting. I went to the Presbyterian Meeting and heard Mr. Allison deliver a most pathetic and animating, as well as pious, patriotic and elegant Discourse. I have seldom been better pleased or more affected with a sermon.  FEBRUARY 3, 1777  The Presbyterian Meeting House in Baltimore stands upon an Hill just at the Back of the Town, from whence We have a very fair Prospect of the Town, and of the Water upon which it stands, and of the Country round it. Behind this Eminence, which is the Bacon [Beacon] Hill of Baltimore, lies a beautifull Meadow, which is entirely incircled by a Stream of Water. This most beautifull Scaene must be partly natural and partly artificial. Beyond the Meadow and Canall, you have a charming View of the Country. Besides the Meeting House there is upon this Height, a large and elegant Court House, as yet unfinished within, and a small Church of England in which an old Clergyman officiates, Mr. Chase, Father of Mr. Chace one of the Delegates of Maryland, who they say is not so zealous a Whigg as the Son.  I shall take Opportunities to describe this Town and State more particularly to you hereafter. I shall inquire into their Religion, their Laws, their Customs, their Manners, their Descent and Education, their Learning, their Schools and Colledges and their Morals. It was said of Ulysses I think that he saw the Manners of many Men and many Cities, which is like to be my Case, as far as American Men and Cities extend, provided Congress should continue in the rolling Humour, which I hope they will not. I wish however, that my Mind was more at rest than it is, that I might be able to make more exact Observations of Men and Things as far as I go.  When I reflect upon the Prospect before me of so long an Absence from all that I hold dear in this World, I mean all that contributes to my private personal Happiness, it makes me melancholly. When I think on your Circumstances I am more so, and yet I rejoice at them in spight of all this Melancholly. God almightys Providence protect and bless you and yours and mine.  ""

  Dear Sir Baltimore Feby. 3. 1777  After a very tedious Journey, through the severist Weather, and over very bad Mountains, in one Part of it, and perfect Mortar, in the other Part, I am arrived in good Health, and Spirits at Baltimore.  Congress is Sitting, and by the best Information I can obtain from our Friends, are very well united and much more Spirited than ever.  The Recruiting Service goes on, as every Body tells me, from Boston to Baltimore, very well, and it is here said, in Virginia. I cannot sufficiently express the Sense I have of the indespensible Importance that our State Should be the earliest and most exemplary in compleating our Quota. It may be depended upon, that our State is the Barometer at which every  FEBRUARY 3, 1777  other Looks. If the Mercury rises, there, it will rise in every other Part of the Continent, if it falls there, it will fall every where.  By all that I can gather, the British Ministry have Sollicited for Cossacks. The Swiss is doubtfull, But it is the opinion of a Man in England whose Intelligence has heretofore proved extreamly exact, that the Ministry will be able to obtain near Twenty thousand Recruits in England, Scotland and Ireland and Germany. If this Conjecture is right there is great Reason to Suppose that they will not Venture upon so dangerous a Step as that of procuring Siberians. Their late great Successes will in their opinion render them unnecessary. But in all Events, it is our Wisdom, our Prudence, our Policy, our Cunning, our Duty, our every Thing to destroy, those who are now in America. They are compleatly in our Power and if We do not embrace the opportunity, We shall not only in dust and ashes repent of our sloth, but it will be but Justice that We should Suffer the wretched Consequences of it. I am Sure, our brave New Englandmen can break the Force of Newport-and even the main Body at Brunswick May be imprisoned. But an Army is wanting. Dont let it be wanting long.  Congress will do and have done what they can-but if the States will not execute the Plans and Resolutions of Congress what is to be expected?  New England, I find is now in higher Estimation than it has been. Our Troops have behaved nobly, and turned the Fortune of the War. Pray let us keep up our Credit, as I am sure We can. Adieu my dear Friend.  ""

  Dear Sir Baltimore Feb. 3. 1777 It may not be a Mispense of Time to make a few Observations upon the Situation of some of the States at this Time.  That Part of New York which is yet in our Possession is pretty well united, and pretty firm. The Jerseys have recovered from their Surprize, and are lending as much assistance as can well be expected from them. Their assembly is now Sitting, and are Said to be well disposed to do what they can. The Assembly of Pensilvania, is also Sitting. They have abolished the oath which gave so much Discontent to the People, and are gradually acquiring the Confidence of the People, and opposition has Subsided. The :Delaware Government have formed their Constitution, and the Assembly is now Sitting. Maryland has formed its Constitution and their Assembly now Sitting in Consequence of it, are filling it up. There is a Difficulty in two of the Counties, but this will last but a little while. In Virginia Governor Henry has recovered his Health, has returned to Williamsburg, and is proceeding in his government with great Industry. N. FEBRUARY 3, 1777  Carolina have compleated their Government, and Mr Caswell is Governor. In Virginia and North Carolina, they have made an Effort for the Destruction of Bigotry which is very remarkable. They have abolished their Establishments of Episcopacy so far as to give compleat Liberty of Conscience to Dissenters, an Acquisition in favour of the Rights of Mankind, which is worth all of the Blood and Treasure which has been and will be Spent in this war. S. Carolina and Georgia compleated their Governments, a long time ago. Thus I think there are but three States remaining which have not erected their Governments, Massachusetts, N. York and New Hampshire.  These are good Steps towards Government in the State which must be introduced and established before we can expect Discipline in our Armies, the Unum necessarium to our Salvation.  I will be instant and incessant, in season and out of season, in inculcating these important Truths, that nothing can Save Us but Government in the State and Discipline in the Army. There are so many Persons among my worthy Constituents who love Liberty better than they understand it that I expect to become unpopular by my Preaching. But Woe is me if I preach it not. Woe will be to them, if they do not hear.  I am terrified with the Prospect of Expence, to our State, which I find no Possibility of avoiding. I cannot get an Horse kept in this Town under a Guinea a Week. One hundred and four guineas a year for the Keeping of two Horses, is intolerable, but cannot be avoided. Simple Board is fifty shilling a Week here, and Seven Dollars generally. I cannot get boarded under forty shillings, i.e. five dollars and a third a Week for myself and fifteen for my servant-besides finding for myself all my wood, Candles, Liquers and Washing.  I would send home my servant and Horses, but Congress is now a moveable Body, and it is impossible to travell and carry great Loads of Baggage without a servant and Horses, besides the Meanness of it, in the Eyes of the World.

  Honble Gentlemen, Baltimore 3 Feby. 1777 The number and vigilance of our enemies hath prevented us hitherto from sending the enclosed Despatches through these southern ports And since it is of the last importance to the American Cause that these letters should reach their destination with all possible dispatch, We beg the favor  FEBRUARY 3, 1777  of you, Gentlemen, to cause the quickest Sailing vessel that to be directly engaged on continental account to carry the Packet No. 1 directly to France. We wish the Captain to be a man of secrecy and discretion, that without disclosing to any one his destination or his business, he may immediately on his arrival repair by post to Paris, deliver the letters with his own hand to the Gentlemen they are intended for, or to any one of them, receive their answer, and be governed by their directions touching his return and the port he is to come to.(1)  We meet with so much difficulty in the business of Remittance, that we are desirous this vessel should take with her such Merchandize as she can conveniently without injuring her sailing, but by no means occasion any delay. For this purpose the Secret Committee send a letter to their Agent which You will please to convey to him,(2) that he may while the vessel is fitting, prepare a small cargo for her.  The Merchants in Nantes on whom we send a letter of credit for the Captain, will inform him where to find either, or all of the Gentlemen, to whom the letters are addressed in Paris.

  Dear Sir Baltimore February 3d. 1777 The impossibility of getting intelligence at present thro' this Bay, has obliged us to send an Express to the Council of Massachusetts, requesting they will immediately dispatch a quick sailing Vessel with letters to the Commissioners The only Vessel we had sent from hence for this purpose, is now shut up in a small Creek below by the Men of War four of five of which are now in this Bay, as we are informed, & some of them as high as Smiths Point, mouth of Potowmack, they have taken Buchanans ship as she went down.(1) We have reason to suppose that these are the ships that lately block'd up the Delaware, and that they are brought here by the fugitive Guthridges' and the Tories on the Eastern shore of Maryland. The latter are numerous, and we apprehend have informed of a quantity of Provisions preparing there for the Troops which they mean to assist in getting to the Enemy.  We are doing all we can in this slow place to get armed Vessels down to obstruct this wicked design. In the mean time would it not be highly proper to send out immediately the Sachem or Race Horse, or both to the Capes of Virginia to notify coming in Vessels of their danger, and also  FEBRUARY 3, 1777  to suppress any Tenders that they may have out to intercept Vessels coming in, whilst they think themselves secure from interruption from hence by the large ships covering the passage of the Bay opposite Potowmack. Captain Isaiah Robinson is as perfectly well acquainted with our Bay that he could in a swift sailing Vessel not only give notice to Vessels bound in, but come in himself, suppress their Tenders, and, regardless of the bigger Ships run into a thousand places of protection and security where they cannot molest him, taking care of the Counties of Somerset, Worster and an adjoining Maryland Eastern shore. If you approve this Plan can it not be immediately executed? (2) I am inclined to think your Bay is open now, and that it is a good opportunity to push Biddle and the other Vessels out on the business you mention. We shall keep the letters you sent us for France until we can get an opportunity here, when we propose sending out the Lexington.  Bradfords' Journal of the 29th of January contains a very accurate account of the late Military Manouvres in the Jersies, it will be well to send three or four copies to the Commissioners and by all means let some go by this Express in the Packets for France.

I wish some ingenious Pen might be employd. The Contest with America, it seems, is now confessd by the British Monarch to be \""arduous.\"" I think he greatly deceives himself, if he does not expect it will be more so. Indeed he sees it; for we must, says he, \""at all Events prepare for another Campaign.\"" \""If their Treason is sufferd to take Root, much Mischief will grow out of it-to the present System of all Europe.\"" Here we have the Authority of a King's (not a very wise one I confess) to affirm, that the War between Britain and the united States of America will affect the Balance of Power in Europe. Will not the different Powers take different Sides to adjust the Ballance to their different Interests? \""I am using my utmost Endeavors to conciliate the unhappy Differences between two Neighboring Powers.\"" If he is still using his Endeavors, it seems, the Differences are not yet made up. \""I continue to receive Assurances of Amity from the several Courts in Europe\""-But he adds \""It is expedient we should be in a respectable State of Defence at home.\"" If he has such Assurances of the Continuance of Amity in Europe, why is it so expedient at this time to be in a respectable State of Defence at home? Surely he cannot think the American Navy yet so formidable, as to demand this Caution. Or is he at length become wise enough to attend to a good old Maxim, In Peace prepare for War. By his prefixing a \""Notwithstanding\"" to his \""fair Prospect,\"" and his being manifestly hard pressd with \""the present Scituation of Affairs\"" in America, I am led to conclude, that he looks upon his \""Assurances of Amity\"" as the mere Compliments of a Court; and that he strongly apprehends, the Quarrel he has plungd himself into with America hath excited a Curiosity and a Watchfulness in some of the Powers of Europe, which will produce a contrary Effect.

He was pilot to the fleet under Lord How, & brought them into Hudson's river, was consulted by the Admiral concerning certain Expeditions which he had in contemplation, which Ferns declared to be unadvisable because of the late season. A communication was carried on between the Tories in every State and New York & a traffic of gold & silver for continental money. Mr. Cornell added the adventurers in this traffic. Two from North Carolina had lately dealt to a considerable amount, & I fancy reside in or near Newbern.  I intend hereafter to trouble you with a letter every post, & shall give my sentiments of the different political principles which I shall perceive to actuate the several States, the measures intended to be pursued, the intelligence we receive & the important decisions in Congress. I find a considerable jealousy is entertained of the Northern States, I know not how justly; at present I must refer you to Mr. Hooper who is much better qualified to give you satisfaction on all these matters than I am. Our situation here is unsettled, uncomfortable, & incredibly expensive. These circumstances will I doubt not occasion another adjournment of Congress. Mr. Hooper takes with him all the newspapers, & some copies of the King's speech; you will doubtless see them, & I need not suggest any reflections; they will readily occur to you, & you will foresee greater events than have yet distinguished our struggles.

I have the honour to be sir, with due respect, & sincere Esteem, Your very obed. serv't, Thos Burke  Feby 5th. This day it was resolved in Congress that Col. Nash should be appointed a Brigadier General, that he should proceed to the western part of our State, & expedite as much as possible the recruiting service, & that the several Battalions of Continental Troops in North & South Carolina should join General Washington as soon as may be after the fifteenth of March.(2) It was proposed to request your assistance in forwarding the recruiting business, but we observed that you were already sensible of the necessity of such an exertion of your interest & influence, & being so well inclined to serve to your utmost power the cause of America, there was no need to remind you of it.

From my family since Novemr. My pleasure is much increased by the additional circumstance of the People of Eliza. Town being able to Attend public Worship without interruption; as I had heard and believed Our Church & your house were both burned by the Enemy. I must now suppose the Acct. not true or you would not have omitted mentioning it. I wrote you upwards of two weeks ago by Dr Witherspoon(1) who set off for a Sight of Princeton and hath not returned; in that I ventured a large Draft on you for intelligence. I earnestly wish to know the State of our Country and of our Friends, which I have not yet been able to Obtain. Two Armies, one of which the most Savage known among civilized nations, must have Spread desolation through the Country which an age can Scarcely recover. I feel for their distresses, and wish I could think them at an end, but this is beyond my expectations. Great Britain undoubtedly hath contracted for a large Numr. of Rusians which will pay us a Visit next Summer unless Prevented. Our General cause will I think Nevertheless Obtain a Support, he that setteth up states doth not, usually put them down in a Year, and I doubt not but by the Providence of God we shall be enabled to withstand our Foes. A Union or aliance I believe is now forming for our Support. France, Spain & Prusia, and perhaps Sweden will unite in it, the Independance of America hath catched the Attention of Europe, and all Commercial States are wishing for a share of our Commerce. France & Spain are exerting their utmost efforts to prepare for War, our Flag is wore in their harbours, and our Vessels protected, our Prizes where carried in Secured for us, and the duties on American trade chiefly taken of. All intelligence from France & Spain as favourable as we can expect, the great Obsticle with those kingdoms were apprehensions of a Reconcilia- FEBRUARY 4, 1777  tion between Britain & us, these were raised by Lord Stormont & Mr Wedderborne and some American Renegadoes. They are now removed. We have the kings Speech which you have or likely soon will see, his majesty seems to Speak somewhat faultering, and tho' he hath friendly assurances from his Neighbours yet he thinks it necessary to provide for defence at home.  Your enquiry after the pay of the Staff must at present be satisfied by being informed the same is under consideration of the board of war & will I expect soon be reported. The pay of Chaplain was raised last July to 33 & 1 or 2 thirds of a dollar. You are Sensible in Settling the pay of Officers we must Attend to it in general & cannot come up to the Merit of some particular persons who are found to fill the office, when multitudes scarcely deserve the reward allowed. I most heartily wish you could have the appointment of paymaster added to that of Chaplain but I fear to mention it as it is contrary to Established Rules, but can it be done with propriety it shall not be neglected.  There are now four or five Men of War in this Bay, as well as some in Delaware. They greatly Annoy our trade. The two lower Counties of Maryland on the Eastern Shore & Sussex on Delaware, give us much trouble; they are mostly disaffected and are encouraged by the Men of War near them. Measures are however taking for Suppressing them, but this will necessarily stop forces who would otherwise soon join Genl Washington, which by his Letters he seems much in want of. Many are Surprized at the Divided State of our Army dispersed through the Jerseys, they seem to be in the same posture as the Enemy were when Attacked at Trenton & Princetown. Genl. Heath we can hear nothing of, it was said he had taken Fort Independance but this is now contradicted. Yesterday was observed as a public Fast through this state, I heard Mr. Patrick Allison Preach, and was much pleased with his performance. I am in hopes he will be prevailed with to publish it. In the Evening a Kitchen or Stable or both belonging to a public house in this town took fire & was consumed the main building preserved but much damaged, this house had been taken up & used through the day in frolicking & dancing which at night ended in a blaze.  This is one of the most horrible places I have seen, the poorest of board a dollar a day for diet & Lodging, Wine 12/ a bottle, rum 30/ per Gall., horse keeping 3/6 per day, these people might be pictured with hooks on every finger sure to catch something if you come near them.  I esteem myself greatly Obliged by your readiness to procure a place for my family; If the Enemy leave Brunswick this Winter I shall not care to improve my own place next Summer, but would chuse to hire it out and hire a place for myself prety far back as far at least as Black river, or if I could buy a place of about £500 Value good for grazing I should have no Objections to it, but I believe the Extravagent rise of Land will prevent my purchasing.   Febry. 5th. The above I wrote last night. I shall now only add, that this day I moved Congress to give you the appointment of paymaster in Addition to that of Chaplain, this was opposed as Contrary to the former Resolves of Congress, which however in one Instance hath been broken through; Congress, Sensible of the important service you have rendered our Common Cause manifested a great readiness to take proper Notice of your Zeal & industry and Accordingly Apptd. a Committee to consider & reward the same.

  Sir Philada. Feby 4th. 1777 We received the enclosed dispatches (1) yesterday by private conveyances & now send them forward by Post. We cannot help adding to what the General has said of the want of Money, that the demands here are so numerous that the last 200000 Dollars you sent us are nearly gone. The Commissary of Provisions required 60,000 dollars yesterday, The Director of the Hospitals 10,000. Mr Palfrey has drawn several orders on us for near 50,000. We had to repay 10,000 that we had borrowed beside making advances to numbers of the recruiting Officers for that Service which we think essential & we are also supplying Mr Dallam with money to pay off the Militia that are regularly discharged from Camp after having done their duty there. The Board of Assistants to the Marine Committee are now getting the Tradesmen & others to Work on the Frigates & other vessells of War here & will want Money for that department, hitherto it has been supplyed by drawing all the Continental share of Prize money out of the Agents hands & that Fund is exhausted for present. The Quarter Master General will have very heavy demands for his department. The Commissary of Provisions will be calling daily for heavy supplies whilst they are forming Magazines and in short when we reflect that you cannot have much of the last five million unappropriated & that what does remain is to be printed & signed at the very time it is wanted, That your dependance afterwards is to be on a Loan with which the People who are to lend are not Satisfied & on a Lottery the Success of which is by no means certain & that in addition to all these disagreable circumstances the war must inevitably be carried on at four times the expence that has been spent before on Acct of the great addition to your Army in Horse & Foot & on Acct of the high prices of every thing wanted or rather of the depreciation of the Value of your Money. All these things being duely considered & it is high time they were so, What is to be done? (2)  We hope the Congress will excuse us, but we see an absolute necessity for the utmost & speediest exertions. You must raise the interest of the Loan Office at least to 5 per Cent, many think & probably it may be the  FEBRUARY 4, 1777  most effectual & best way to fix it at six per Cent which will instantly remove all objections. You will get what money can be borrowed & You will want it even if instead of the seven Milion voted you shou'd be offered twenty. This year will cost nearer 40 million than twenty & where is it to be got if early & effectual means are not taken. The addition of interest will make no heavy addition to the public debt & it is paid to the inhabitants of America, so that in fact the Country is not a bit the poorer and the debt be increased. Not so with what you borrow abroad, there the Interest is an Actual loss to America & here you have voted six per Cent which necessity alone cou'd or will justify, but the necessity of borrowing Money at home is equally great, at least so it appears to us.  The Removal of Congress from-this City, had a pernicious influence on the Credit of their Money. You will Consider Philada from its Central situation, the extent of its Commerce, the Number of its artificers, Manufacturers & other Circumstances to be, to the United States, in the Circulation of their money, what the Heart is to the Human body in Circulating the blood. The Continental Currency is perpetually passing & repassing through it for Commercial & other purposes and it carries with it from hence, wherever it goes some proportion of value to what it bears here. This is now verifyed, for since it sunk here, the depreciation is gradually extending to the extremity. We are of opinion the Congress may now return with safety & that they cannot be disturbed by any new attacks on this side September by which time we shall certainly have an army able to meet & Cope with the Enemy wherever they please. We ground our present opinion of safety to this City on many recurring Circumstances, but principally on the Enemies want of Horses to move the necessary Stores, provisions, Forage, Artillery &c &c for such an undertaking. They have not Numbers sufficient & what they have are unable to do the duty, neither can they Subsist what they have. They will not undertake such an Expedition by Water for they have not men enough to hold New York & attack this place at the same time. If they depend on assistance from Quebec they cannot get those Troops here by Sea sooner than August & as to reinforcements from Europe they must be more difficult to be had & later in coming this year than last & so in each succeeding year whilst they are mad enough to carry on the war. If this reasoning be right, the Congress may return with safety and we immagine it does not require Arguments to prove that the general interests of America requires that they shou'd return if possible. Where you now are, you have not, nor can you possibly have that immediate assistance to the various departments of your business, that can at all times be commanded here. The preparations for next Campaigne are now beginning. [They] are immense. This place we see plainly already must [be] the nursery for them; the objects are so important that you shou'd be on the spot and have them under your inspection. For our parts we feel the weight of the applications made to us on  this head & foresee that if the Congress do not remove a Committee at this place will have the heaviest burthen of any in America. We are convinced that your return here will give confidence to your army & Credit to your Money and as it is our opinion we think it our duty to offer the same to Congress only requesting that no member who hears this read, may allow himself to suppose us influenced by Local attachments, which is sometimes suspected, and of which we cou'd readily acquit ourselves by a single declaration was it necessary.  The Commissary of Military Stores Colo Flowers wants the determination of Congress whether the Elaboratory is to be established at York Town or not, he thinks the Ground on which the buildings are to be erected shou'd be purchased & wishes for instructions on that head, in whose name is it to be held &c? It falls within his department to provide Musquets, Carbines, Pistols, Swords & all military Accoutrements. He is trying to arrange that business and desires to know whether he shall Contract with the different manufacturers in this branch, especially for what will be wanted to fit out the Horse, we think he ought.  The Randolph Frigate is on her way down the River with several Merchantmen under Convoy, the Hornet & Fly attending them and we hope they will get safe out. That being once accomplished we shall be impatient to give you good accounts from Capt Biddle. We take the liberty to enclose Mr Jewells Account for the Inspection of the Treasury Board & if passed they will please to give us orders for payment.(3)Mr Young the sadler has frequently called on us for the Answer to his Acct sent down sometime since. Be pleased also to deliver the enclosed Memorial to the Honble Delagates of So Carolina, and receive for amusement a New York paper herewith. With perfect esteem & regard, We are sir, Your most obedt hble servants, Robt Morris  Geo Clymer [P.S.] The General officers that are here & those that have been here lately, all agree that the business to be done in this & the two ensueing months will be of such extent & of so great Consequence that Congress shou'd be on the Spot if possible, but if they dont choose to remove they shou'd make an addition to this Committee of several very clear headed sensible active members capable of going through the business.  Since writing the above, Genl Mifflin informs us you have given him an order on Mr Smith the Loan Officer who has not a farthing to give him, therefore his whole operations must be at a stand untill he can be supplied. R.M.  P.S. Enclosed is the Instructions to Cap Coren a mast[er] said to be [a] usefull Officer, with a recommendation from Genls Gates & Mifflin respecting his Rank & pay which we believe ought to be complied with,   the sooner it is determined the better.

  Dear Sir, Baltimore Feby. 4th 1777 Nothing material having occured since I wrote you last in the military way, this serves chiefly to inclose you the Tyrants speech, which is a curious crafty piece of business. Curious it certainly is to find a Man on so public a situation anouncing to the world his utter disregard of truth. Crafty it may be called, because of the mode taken to prove our good usage. He would have the world conclude that this good usage has been of his shewing, and therefore our ingratitude great in proceeding as we have done. The Court Logic seems clearly this-The American improvement in Arts & Arms shews they have been well used, it shews I have used them well, and therefore they are wicked in deposing me. Or in other words-George the second used the Americans well. George the 3d has abused them extremely. Therefore they are criminal in opposing George the 3d. The visit paid us by the British Ships, and, as we hear, the number of small craft they have seized in our narrow waters, prove incontestibly the disadvantage we shall forever be exposed to while we are in want of Marine force. Had our Gallies been in good order and fit for business, the Barges and small Craft of the enemy would never have dared to attempt the Capture of Vessels in our shallow, narrow waters. And I will venture to affirm that if we had 8 or 10 such Gallies as Congress have built in the Delaware, to carry 4 thirty two pounders each with 10, 6-pounders 8: 100 men Not less than a Squadron of Line of Battle Ships would venture up our Bay.

  Dear Sir Philada Feby 4th. 1777 Your favour of the 7th Ulto came safe to hand.(1) Timothy Jones is certainly a very entertaining agreable man, one wou'd not judge so from any thing contained in his cold insipid letter of the 17th Septr. unless you take pains to find the Concealed beauties therein.(2) The Cursory observation of a Sea Captain wou'd never discover them, but transferred from his hand to the penetrating Eye of a Jay the Diamonds Stand Confessed at once, it puts me in mind of a Search after the Philosophers Stone, but I believe not one of the followers of that Phantom have come so near the mark as you my Good Friend. I handed a Copy of your discoverys to the Committee which now Consists of Harrison, R.H.

I shou'd never doubt the success of measures Conducted by such able heads as those that take the lead in your Convention, I hate to pay Compliments and wou'd avoid the appearance of doing it but I cannot refrain from saying I love Duane, admire Mr. Livingston & have an Epithet for you if I had been writing to another. I am stationed here with Mr Walton of Georgia & my Colleague Mr Clymer as a Committee of Congress for transacting all Continental business that may be proper & necessary at this place. Abundance of it we have & I believe we dispatch about 7/8ths of that damn'd trash that used to take up 3/4ths of the debates in Congress; and give them no trouble about the matter, but we have this day wrote them pressingly to come back. Whether they will or not is uncertain as I am told some of them are attached to the place, others execrate it. I do not Condemn their flight from hence as I shou'd have done had I been at the distance you are, but I cannot spare time to explain myself for I write in haste & proceed to unfold a little business I want to trouble you with.  Major West the nephew of my Friend Will West was taken Prisoner at Fort Washington. He had made a kind of bargain with Mr Elliot late Collr. of New York to get exchanged for Mr. Jauncey junr. and I represented the matter to Congress, who very wisely passed the inclosed Resolve,(3) the agreement was that if Major West cou'd make interest with Congress, Mr Elliot cou'd do the needfull with Genl. Howe to affect this exchange, at least so I understand it. West is an Active good Officer, & has great interest in our back Country that wou'd enable him to recruit fast. Mr Jauncey I fancy may as well be in N York as Connecticut and I wish you wou'd forward this business of exchange if you think it right. My Compts to Mr Duane & Mr Livingston and I hope they will join you in it.  I wish you had done with your Convention. You are really wanted exceedingly in Congress. They are very thin, Hooper gone off with a  FEBRUARY 4, 1777  Fever, Tom Nelson with an appoplictic complaint. When I say gone off I dont mean to the other World, only to another part of this, one for Virginia & other for N Carolina. Harrison has barely weathered it, but he is mending. T.

  [February 4, 1777] (1) Upon motion in Congress whether the meeting held by the four New Engd states by deputies at Providence Decemr 25 1776 was a proper one and whether it did not stand in need of the Approbation of Congress to make it valid.  It was said by Mr Saml Adams. That a right to assemble upon all occasions to consult measures for promoting liberty & happiness was the priviledge of freemen-that it was contested by govr Hutchinson & that it was dreaded only by tyrants.  Mr Richd Henry Lee. It was said on the same side of the Question that we were not yet confederated-therefore no law of the union infringed.  Col: Wilson on the negative said that the design in the committee of the 4 New England States in sending their proceedings to congress was to demand their approbation.  That the same was clearly intimated by the tenor of the appointments from Rhode Island and Connecticut-that the committee had commanded, and countermanded continental troops-that the said troops FEBRUARY 4, 1777  were to be paid by the continent-therefore that the business the Committee transacted was wholly continental and of course required the approbation of Congress.  Mr John Adams said that he lately travelled thro' New Engd. & that he was sure that the approbation of the congress of the meeting would give pleasure to the committee and their constituents. That their meeting was founded in necessity, that Altho' we were not confederated the same principles of equity &: reason should govern us as if we were united by a confederacy-that the four New England states bore the same relation to the congress that four counties bore to a single State. These four counties have a right to meet to regulate roads, and affairs that relate to the poor, but they have no right to tax or execute any other branch of legislation. In like manner the four New Engd. States, or any Other four States have a right to meet upon matters wholly indifferent, but they have no right to touch upon Continental Subjects-that the committee from the 4 New Engd. States have touched upon continental Subjects, therefore the meeting stands in need of the approbation of the Congress.  Dr Rush. The desire of independance is natural not only to individuals but to communities. There was a time (near 200 years) when it was wrong to say a word agst. the dependance of the colonies upon Great Britain. A time came when it was equally criminal to enforce that dependance. The time may come & probably will come when it will be the interest of the united States to be independant of each other, but I can conceive of no temporal punishment to be severe eno' for that man who attempts to dissolve, or weaken the union for a century or two to come. I admire the proceedings of the committee assembled at Providence. They are full of political virtue & wisdom, and I think the other States will act wisely & virtuously in proportion as they resemble them. But I think the meeting is full of great and interesting consequences, and should be regarded with a serious & jealous eye. Their business was chiefly continental, and therefore they usurped the powers of congress as much as four counties would usurp the powers of legislation in a state shd. they attempt to tax themselves. The committee have in one instance in regulating the price of goods counterred an express resolution of congress, and lastly tho' the meeting was necessary and no injustice intended or done by it to any state, yet it becomes us to remember that arbitrary power has often originated in justice & necessity.  This question was decided by a majority in the Committee of the whole house in the affirmative, but in the negative a few days Afterwards. It was reconsidered Feby 13rd.(2)  ""

  Sir Philada. Feby 5th. 1777 I have frequently received your letters advising me the particulars of your several Cruizes. and with pleasure assure you that the Contents in every instance have been very acceptable, always entertaining & in many parts usefull. These letters I have from time to time communicated to the members of the Marine Committee all of whom express their satisfaction with your Conduct. You wou'd no doubt expect an answer from them to your proposal for a Cruize this Winter on the Coast of Africa,(1) and such they intended to give you long since, but the confusion occasioned by their removal from this City to Baltimore & the multiplicity of business that has unavoidably crowded on every member of Congress, put it out of their power to give that attention to your department that they wou'd always wish to carry into every American Concern. Thus Circumstanced they never doubted but your Active genius wou'd find usefull employment for the Ship you Command, as you were so near the Commodore & cou'd go cloathed with his Authority & they have not been disapointed for you have in this way made a most usefull & successfull Voyage to Cape Breton & thence to Boston. Major Frazer passing through this City (which I have never left) sent me an account of that Cruize  FEBRUARY 5, 1777  which appeared to be in your own handwriting. Pleased with your Success, I transmitted it to Congress and wrote that, if they pleased, I wou'd point out an enterprize or two for you to undertake & leave the Choice to yourself; this was agreed to, and my present design is to fullfill that promise.(2) When I made it, I had in view either to gratify your desire by undertaking an expedition as you proposed to the Coast of Africa, or to gratify my own by undertaking what I think will prove a more usefull one & nearer home. I have pretty good information that there is Stationed at Pensacola only two or three Sloops of war from 10 to 16 Guns, and that at that place there is not less than 100 pieces of Brass Artillery which our Armies are much in want of. These insignificant Sloops of war lie there in perfect Security or now & then take a Cruize along the Coast of Georgia & Carolina. Shou'd they be met with they will inevitably become your prizes. Shou'd they be out of the way Pensacola may become the more easy prey. It is true that Governor Chester has been trying to put that place in a posture of defence, but he has no Troops and the inhabitants will never defend it, therefore my plan is that you shou'd take the Alfred, Columbus, Cabot, Hamden, and Sloop Providence, proceed first to the Island of St Christophers where a sudden & unexpected attack will carry that place being very defenceless. There is a Number of Canon & Stores there, as well as merchandize of various sorts that we are in want of and I fancy you will make a considerable booty. This however is not what I have so much in View as to alarm not only the Inhabitants but the whole British Nation. It will oblige the ministers to provide for the Security & protection of every Island they have & by that means they must divide their Force & leave our Coasts less carefully guarded. From St. Kitts (where your stay must be short) you can proceed down to Pensacola. I apprehend the best passage might be down the South side of Hispaniola & then you might give an alarm to the North side of Jamaica by putting into some of the outports there, cutting out their Ships &c in all which however you must be expeditious or their Fleet will be after you. Shou'd you decline meddling with Jamaica the best passage will be down the No Side of Hispaniola, through the Passage of Cape St Nicholas & Cape Maize & then down the So Side of Cuba. When you arrive at Pensacola it may be well done to send a Brigt & a Sloop to Cruize off the mouth of the Mississipi so long as you remain in that quarter but they shou'd wear English Colours & never go so near into the Balize as to be known for any thing but English Cruizers. There is at this time not less than £100,000 Sterlg Value in goods up that River the remittances for which will come away in the months of March, April & May, in Indico, Rice, Tobacco, Skins & Furs, so that this alone is an object worthy of your attention, but as I have said before, destroying their Settlements & spreading alarms, shewing & keeping up a Spirit of Enterprize that will oblige them to defend their extensive possessions at all points is of infinitely more Consequence to the United States of America than all the Plunder that  can be taken. If they divide their Force we shall have elbow room & that gained we can turn about & play our parts to the best advantage which we cannot do now, being constantly cramped in one part or another. It has long been clear to me that our infant Fleet cannot protect our own Coasts & that the only effectual relief it can afford us is to attack the Enemies defenceless places & thereby oblige them to Station more of their Ships in their own Countries or to keep them employed in following ours, and either way we are relieved so far as they do it. I do not pretend to give you any Account of the Coasts or Harbours, Strength of Fortifications or mode of attack, for I cannot doubt your being well acquainted with these things, knowing as I do that you have been a Commander in the West India Trade & at any rate your appearance will be unexpected, the enemy unprepared, they have no Troops and the very sound of a Great Gun will frighten them into submission. Govr Chester will no doubt know where the Brass Artillery are deposited and be glad to surrender them as a ransom for himself & his Capital. When your business is done at Pensacola you may give them an alarm at St Augustine, but here they have some Troops and you must be carefull of your men. I think you shou'd carry with you as many marines as possible for they will be usefull & necessary in all your Land Excursions. The Southern Colonies wish to see part of their Navy and if you find it Convenient & safe you might recruit & refit at Georgia, South or North Carolina, there make Sale of such part of your Prize Goods &c as wou'd be usefull to them, learn where was the safest Port to the Northward & then push along to such place of safety as might be necessary for refitting & remanning the Fleet. Shou'd you prefer going to the Coast of Africa you have the Consent of the Marine Committee, but in that case I apprehend you only want the two Ships & Sloop Providence. Remember it is a long voyage, that you cannot destroy any English settlements there, and that if you meet any of their men of War in those Seas they will be much superiour to you in Strength &c. You may it is true do them much mischief, but the same may be done by Cruizing to windward of Barbadoes as all their Guinea men fall in there. However you are left to your choice and I am sure will choose for the best. Shou'd there be a difficulty in getting all the Vessells fully manned with so many Seamen as you may think necessary, take the more Marines & you will get Seamen from Prizes in the Course of your Voyage. It is a Standing instruction from the Marine Committee to the Commanders in the American Navy to be carefull of their Ships, the Materials & Stores, to use well their officers and men, preserving however strict discipline, to treat Prisoners with Humanity & generosity, and to keep them advised of their proceedings as frequently as Circumstances will permit.(3) Wishing you the utmost Success, I am, Sir, Your Obedt hble Servant,  Robt Morris V. P. of the Marine Committee   P.S. If you get the Brass pieces land them in the first port in these States & have them valued.  ""

  Gentlemen, Baltimore Town Feby 6. 1777, Thursday Noon Congress are very anxious, that some immediate Steps should be taken by our State, not only as to the person of Captain Patterson, but as to  FEBRUARY 6, 1777  the Payment of the Engagement entered into by the Continental and your Agent. Capt. Patterson is viewed as a pirate, and after Examination, if the facts should appear to You to be well founded, it may be well to consider, if it would not be proper to send him to Martinico for Trial there, by the Law of Nations.(1) If our State shall pay the Value of the Vessel & Goods seized by Patterson, would it not be proper to inform the Governor of Martinique that the whole would have been returned, but for the Risque? If no Remittance can be made but by produce, it will be an equal Risque to send back the Vessell. Could not Mr. Morriss pay the Money for our State? An opportunity of writing will present itself in a few Days. Would it not be proper for our State to write a Letter, disavowing the Conduct of Capt. Patterson, and engaging Payment as soon as possible, & mentioning the Men of War in our Bay, which may delay the Remittance.  Mr. Zachariah Campbell, in a Letter from Vienna, of 1st Inst. writes to his Brother Capt. Campbell \""That the Tories in Sussex, Somlerse]t & Wor[cester] Co[un]tys, have been assembling for some days, they have 250 Men collected at Pantens Mill, about 9 Miles from Salisbury, and 'tis reported they have three Field pieces which they received from the Roebuck, with some Men, with Intention to seize the Magazine, & destroy the property of the Whiggs. Coll. Dashiell is now at Salisbury with what Whiggs he could collect, about 130, & is to be reinforced on Monday, by eight Companies from this County.\""  Captain Nicholson's Tender brings accounts that there are three Men of War in the bay, one at the Tangiers, one at Smiths Point, and one in the middle, & that it is reported some Men, with two Field pieces are landed from the Roebuck.  Congress has ordered Colo. Wm. Buchanans Battalion, which was ordd to Camp, to march with Colo. Gist & some armed vessells to prevent any Communication from the Ships, and to prevent their plundering.(2)  I suggest my fears of a Difference injurious to the service, if Genl. Hooper should march on this Business. Colo. Gist will not submit to be commanded by that Gentleman.  I beg Leave to remind the Board of the Opinion of General Gates to the necessary Orders respecting the Fort here.  Several Recommendations have gone from Congress to our State. I hope they will be duly attended to.  If Advice Boats are not sent outside of the Capes, several of our Store Vessells may fall into the Hands of our Enemies.  The post is not come in-no News.

  Dear Sir: Baltimore, 6th Feby, 1777 (1) The events of war having not been considerable lately, this is chiefly intended to enclose you the British king's speech to his Parliament, which you will see in the News paper. Skirmishes are daily happening between our troops and the foraging parties of the enemy, in which we seldom fail to beat them and take their forage. Their numbers are this way daily decreasing, and the survivors in great distress for food and feed. The many horses we have taken from them are emaciated extremely. If our new army can be got up in good time I hope we shall deal effectually with these Tyrant Tools. Mr. Page writes us that a Vessel has arrived with you that brings continental soldier's cloaths.(2) I hope that these being put on the backs of your new recruits, will greatly forward the new inlist- FEBRUARY 6, 1777  ments. That the troops should expeditiously join the General is a point so clearly necessary, that I am sure you will promote it with all your power.  I am, very affectionately yours, Richard Henry Lee.

The Prices of Things here, are much more intollerable than at Boston.

And I fear that after a Time the Evils will break out with greater Violence. The Water will flow with greater Rapidity for having been dammed up for a Time. The only radical Cure will be to stop the Emission of more Paper, and to draw in some that is already out, and devise Means effectually to support the Credit of the Rest.  To this End We must begin forthwith to tax the People, as largely as the distressed Circumstances of the Country will bear.

  Feby 7 1777 Motion in Congress that the President write to every State excepting Virginia and Masschusetts Bay recommending a fuller representation, proposed to leave out the Exceptions, passed in the Negative. Amendment proposed that when ever any State was unrepresented the President Should write requesting a full representation. Agreed by a Majority. Motion to be reconsidered. Amendment proposed that when ever any State was represented by less than three President should write &c. Rejected. Question upon the whole as amended Nos 5, Ayes 4, 1 Divided.  In this Debate the States fully represented insisted on the Exceptions that it might appear they had no need of a Memento. Several other States insisted that no state ought to be permitted to Corrsmit a Vote in the General Council of the States to less than three. That less nor even that Number would Supply Committees. It was answered to the first that every State had made her representation as best Suited her Circumstances, that many were unable to spare or Support One more Numerous. That each was best Judge how many of her Citizens she would Trust, and to what length She would Trust them. That there was no need of publicly calling on them for a representation more full because they already wished the same thing but found it Inconvenient to be Effected. That therefore those who had any representation at all had [already] done what their Circumstances permit [. . .] for greater Exertions. To the Second that the represe[ntatives of] the States who had few refused nor [....] That the weight and Trust were certainly too great for any one person but it was an evil that Could not at present be remedied, and therefore it must be born. That requiring three to form a Quorum would Embarass several States and leave Such State often without any representation at all, because if any Accident prevented the attendance of one, the Vote was Necessarily lost,  FEBRUARY 7, 1777  and any state would prefer a vote by one of her Del[eg]ates rather than No Vote at all.  North Carolina (having only one Delegate present) urged that the arguments Cavilled at the Insufficiency of One Delegate for so Important a Trust were sensibly felt by the Delegate who already tho' but a very few days in Congress found his Experience and abilities far Inferior to his Duty, but this was not the fault of his Country who could not prevail on her abler men to undertake a Business so arduous and Inconvenient. That she had Indeed appointed three but never Expected that they should be always in Service at Once, because the (Duty was too Heavy for one) absence was too long from their private Families and affairs and she had not Funds to support a greater Number. That One who Expected to have been here was prevented by Illness.(1) The other had Just departed and after long attendance was permitted to return home.(2) That the Single Representation of that State was the Misfortune of the Delegate on whom all, Incompetent as he is, the burthen of so high a Trust had fallen and also the misfortune of his Country who in the absence of his more able Colleagues could not be so well served. That Considering it as a matter which Each State had an Exclusive right to Judge of the Delegate could not agree that Congress should at all Interfere with it. That having Just informed the Congress that one of the [delegates had been?] permitted by his Country to return, and that the [consequence] is that only two would be in Service the Delegate Considered the ammendment relative to three is implying a Censure on his Country and he must therefore protest against it. The Intention to Censure was disclaimed.  ""

  Sir Philadelphia Feby. 7th 1777 Your Letters of the 21 December & 17th January to the Marine Committee (1) are with me and I have great pleasure in acknowledging on behalf of that Committee your Zeal and attention to the Public business. The tiding contained in those Letters was very acceptable and I was particularly pleased with Captain Jones's success. By this Express I send him  FEBRUARY 7, 1777  orders for an other Cruize,(2) but by an expression in one of your Letters I imagine he or you have wrote to the Committee and proposed altering the Ship Alfred, that Letter must have passed through here without coming to my hands and the Committee have said nothing to me about it. Should they give any Orders that contradict mine let them be obeyed but if nothing contradictory, Captain Jones will abide by what I have wrote him. I have observed that you frequently did propose discharging those Vessels that were fitted out as Cruizers by General Washington and the Committee were always of your opinion but some how or other in the multiplicity of business and in their late confusion they omitted to give you orders. Now Sir, as I know it was their desire to have those Vessels paid off and dismissed the service I will venture to authorize your doing it and shall send the Committee a Copy of this Letter which you may deem a proper authority: But as I have mentioned in another Letter your employing one of those Vessels to carry the dispatches to France, you must either keep that one in pay or buy her, which I should much prefer, and if any of the rest of them are good Vessels, suitable for Cruizers I should think it best to buy them and continue them in the service, especially as I suppose some of the Commanders and Officers have merit to deserve a continuance in the service: but I am utterly against continuing them on hire and so I think are all the Committee. You may inform Mr. Turnbull that altho the Congress wish by all means to procure the Public Stores on the most reasonable terms possible, yet they cannot desire to injure One part of the Public service for the sake of another, and that the Honest Tars ought to have fair play in the sales of their Prizes. We don't wish to take any advantages of them but would chuse he would guard against monopolizers, Forestallers and combinations of that kind.

  Dear Sir Philada. Feby 7th. 1777 I have already wrote to you two or three Official letters this morning & now come to treat of what Concerns myself & my Friends.(1) The only private letter I have of yours unanswered is dated the 16 Decr. which indeed does not require any reply and you wou'd learn by a letter I wrote you FEBRUARY 7, 1777  sometime since that I suspected some of yours to me must have miscarried. Indeed it was clearly so, as you wrote respecting the purchase of a Vessell, as if I had been previously made acquainted with the Circumstances which I never was. I long to hear from you in answer to my letter of the 24 Decr. & think it is now high time. Untill such Answer Comes I can say nothing respecting any purchases or Speculations you may have made, except that I deem myself bound by my orders & shall chearfully acquiesce therewith. I wrote you lately respecting a Brigt Called the Joseph, Capt Mosely, belonging to my Friends Hewes & Smith of Edenton No. Carolina.(2) It seems she was taken by a Privateer from Newberry Port, the Papers are now before Congress and I suppose will be transmitted from them to your President & Council. Whilst I was writing this letter Mr. Josiah Hewes of this City Brother to Mr. Jos. Hewes of No. Carolina called on me with Copies of the Sundry papers that are laid before Congress, all of which I transmit you herewith together with Mr Hewe's letter to his Brother, and really if your State do not take up this matter as they ought & procure effectual remedy & redress for the Injuries already done & to prevent the like in future, We may bid adieu to our Union, and submit at once to the Galling Yoak of Great Britain, for that will assuredly be the Consequence of these Piracy's on one another. This is the Second Vessell Mr Hewes has had Treated in this way & it is intolerable. You never informed us when his other Brigt the Fanny, Capt. Tokely, sailed, I shou'd be glad to know that, & what measures you took with Capt Payne who seems to be the Owner of the present Pirate. The papers sent relative to this affair are, Capt Moselys affidavit respecting the Capture, a Memorial & remonstrance from the State of No Carolina to the State of Massachusetts Bay, a letter from their President to the Presidt of Massachusetts, a Memorial from the State of No Carolina to the General Congress, a letter from their President to the President of Congress, an Invoice & Valuation of Vessell & Cargo, Jos. Hewes his letter to his Brother Josiah Hewes & also an extract of Hewes & Smiths letter to me, by which you'l see they ultimately fix their dependance on me to procure justice & take care of their Interest but what shall I say as to their Brigt supposing her to have arrived safe. It surely cannot be possible that any judge has or ever will condemn her, she must then most probably be waiting for orders. I make no doubt but Congress will write spiritedly to your State on this Subject, and in the mean time you may be pleased to Communicate these papers to them, remonstrate against the owner & comm[ande]r of this Privateer for this Act of Piracy, Claim Vessell & Cargo with Damages, Sue them for the whole & Pro[secute] the Captain if it can be done as a [. . .] a Rascall deserves hanging without [. . .] such Villains as this that disg[race . . .] & will ruin our Cause, if Mr. Payne [. . .] same person that took the Fanny I [. . .] a premeditated plan to Seize every [. . .] & he shou'd be prosecuted Accordingly [. . .] or Letters of Marque in which these [. . .] away & they never be entrusted with any again. Value put on   the Vessell & Cargo is not equal to what they wou'd sell for here at this time & had she performed her voyage they wou'd have sold higher in No Carolina.  Shou'd this Vessell & Cargo be in your Port I think the Owners of the Privateer shou'd be Condemned to deliver her up to the Owners in No Carolina, that they shou'd pay the full Value for every thing embezzelled, that they shou'd pay for loss of time, Wear & tear, that a master & hands shou'd be hired to carry her to Edenton in No Carolina, the Vessell & Cargo to be insured there & the Owners to pay all the Cost. This I hope you will have done & send her to the Owners soon as possible. They want Vessells in North Carolina, having Cargoes waiting for them, therefore it will not do for them to sell her. They [. . .] want Salt, Bark & all the other articles there [as much] as they can anywhere. In short all [I can say?] on this Subject is, that if you get the [. . . let] her be well fitted with Sails, Rigging and [. . .] valued before she sails & send her to [Messrs. Hewes] & Smith at Edenton with as much of [. . .] as you can get, put in a good honest [master]. Insure the value of the Cargo & advise [. . .] she is to sail & when she does sail.

  My Dear Sir Baltimore 7th Feby 1777 I have receiv'd your favor of 2d Decr but not 'till the 26th Jany.(1) What occasions this delay in the posts I know not, but suppose the fault must lay with the Post Master Genl. He has lately had a Rap, which I hope will have a good effect. I am sorry there is such Backwardness in Col Longs Regiment to March, but its what I always feared. I hope the new army will soon be rais'd, for this Method of calling out the Militia to march such a distance, is the most ruinous plan that ever was invented. I am sorry you want any thing to keep up your Spirits. I shod think the Glorious cause in which we are ingaged is sufficient for that purpose. The prospect of laying a foundation of Liberty & Happiness for Posterity & securing an Asilum for all who wish to injoy those Blessings is an object in my opinion sufficient to raise the mind above every misfortune. The loss of Forts Washington, & Lee, is not I hope to be imputed to Treachery, or Cowardice, but rather to want of Experience. This defect time will supply, & the enormous ravages commited by the Enemy wherever they have pass'd will teach the People wisdom, & inspire them to Noble Deeds. FEBRUARY 7, 1777  The Principle objects of attention is, to raise & supply the army, & prevent the Depreciation of the Currency. The last is the most difficult, but I hope not impracticable. The proceedings of your convention at Providence, has been transmited to Congress by Govr Trumbull & in general highly approved of, but the recommendation to issue money on interest universaly condemn'd. I hope there will be no need of Issuing any, but if that cannot be avoided, I sincerely wish the evil may not be accumulated by adding interest. I cod wish N.H. had followed the example of her neighbouring sister states, in laying a large tax. That is certainly one of the wisest steps that can be taken, nothing in my opinion can tend more to establish the Currency & the People never can be better able to pay a tax then at Present. I hope a recommendation will soon go to the several States to sink the money emited by them as soon as possible. There is more unanimity in Congress than ever, the little Southern jealosies have almost subsided, & the Dickinsonian Politics are Banish'd. J Adams & Lovell are arriv'd from Massachusetts, an exceeding good representation from Virginia, a new member from N. Carolina (one Mr Burke) who I think is the Best man I have seen from that Country. Business goes on smoothly within doors & I am told the recruiting service goes on Briskly without. By Private letters from Spain of 17th Novr there seems to be no doubt of a general war in Europe. On the whole I think affairs wear a favorable aspect, tho' we have heard nothing from our Commissioners but are in daily expectation of very pleasing Intelligence from them. France, Spain, & Prussia, its probable are meditating some grand plan. I believe we may as well ceade Hanover to Prussia, and give Great Britain to France; what think you of this scheme? I suppose you have seen the British Tyrants speech, but least it may have escap'd you I inclose it. I dont know how it may strike your fancy, but it pleases me much. He now thinks the contest Arduous & notwithstanding the assurances of [neutrali]ty from the several Courts of Europe he thinks it necessary to take care of himself. I fancy the wreck begins to see his danger. Authentic accots of the cruelties exercised by the Enemy in New Jersey are collecting & will soon be Publish'd. We are now sending off about 600 men to suppress a Tory faction in two of the Counties of this state on the Eastern shore; this business I expect will soon be effected when the troops are to march on to join Genl Washington. Three men of war now lay in Chesepeak Bay who have taken several vessels one in perticular outward bound, with a load of Tobaco for the Public accot.  It is a long time since I received a line from N.H. The latest was by Mr. Betten which were dated in Decr. It gives me great pain that Mr. Betten shod be so long detain'd, but there was no possibility of avoiding it, the Treasury being almost empty, & the most pressing demands from all Quarters, so that we have been in a perplex'd Scituation, but have now got pretty well over those Difficulties, there being only one demand of consequence now on the Treasury. I wish the accots may be sent forward  FEBRUARY 8, 17 77  and a requisition for more money as soon as possible, so that the money may be forwarded when an opportunity offers. I have given it as my opinion to the President that he advance 400 Dollars to Mr. Betten and charge it to the state of N.H. and he (Mr Betten) to be accountable to the state for that sum, the whole of his expences will then be a fair charge against the Continent. When do you think of coming this way again? I shall not be able to stand it above three months longer, & Col. Thorton seems determin'd to return home in May, so I hope you'll get a good Colleague and relieve us the [beginningl of May at farthest. If you give me timely notice of Your coming, I'll meet you half way. I already find the want of exercise notwithstanding I have had a ride of 100 miles within two months. This place is so intolerable muddy there is no such thing as walking, & I have really no time to ride.  Please to give best respects to Docr.

  1777 Feb. 8th Motion for offering 6 per cent in the Loan Office.(1)  For it, was argued the necessity of money for carrying on the war, which four per cent had not yet procured: the expediency of borrowing on this interest to prevent farther emissions, & of alluring moneyed men to embark in our interest.  Against it, that the public, being the only borrower, must get the money at the interest already offered, if there was any to be lent, that those who withheld money, only did it in hopes our necessity would compel us to give a higher interest, & that they would withhold it as long as they had any prospect of forcing us to offer higher interest, that the interest would be a heavy & unequal burthen on the States, because those who now possess the money would lay the rest under a heavy tax under the name of interest: that there was little money to be borrowed, because men speculated, & found they could lay it out to better advantage, that the necessity for money made it more expedient to seek a more certain resource.  The Delegate of North Carolina could not be satisfied that Loan-Office certificates, & bills of credit, when both had the same security for their redemption, were not in effect the same thing: he therefore thought Loan certificates an other emission in bills of an other denomination, with this unjust inequality, that one part of the community would thereby be taxed to the others. He also thought that much money would not be borrowed on them at any interest, unless it was for the more convenient purposes of exchange, & he thought it would give our Enemies too convenient a machine for affecting our hopes & fears. He would vote against a Loan altogether if it were now the question, & the same reasons induced him to vote against the increase of interest. Question put, Aye 5, No 5. Aye-New Hampshire, M. Bay, N. Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia. No- Rhode-Island, Connecticut. North Carolina, So Carolina, Georgia.  ""

  Feby 8th [1777] An adjourment to Philadelphia was moved for and postponed.  FEBRUARY 8, 1777  A Resolve was moved for offering 6 per cent Interest in the Loan Office. The Debate took up greatest part of the Day, and the determination was postponed at the request of Connecticut.  The Arguments chiefly were that money was absolutely Necessary for Carrying on the War, that four per cent which was already offered could not procure it and it was therefore Necessary to Increase the Interest. That this mode was more eligeable than a farther Emission because it would draw out of Circulation that Superfluous quantity which Occasioned the Rise of all prices. That the alluring monied men to embark in one Common Interest with the other orders of men would greatly add to the security of our Independence.  In answer it was urged that the Offering a higher Interest would not more certainly procure the money, for those who had it to lend would find no borrower but the public-and those who had not would not lend it on any Interest. That the Interest would be an Accumulating Debt (if it could be borrowed) under which the Country must Sink. That the States would be very unequally burthened because those who now possessed the greater part of the Money would lay the other States under a heavy Tax to them under the name of Interest. That [when] there were in the Country no money Lenders [every] Man found that every day's Occurrences [offered him] Opportunities of laying out his money to much greater advantage. That however Necessary the money might be it was still the more Necessary to fall on some Expedient that might procure it with certainty. That the Increase of Interest having been tried in many States without Effect very Clearly proved money was not to be borrowed.  North Carolina urged that it was a clear Truth that money was Necessary. It was equally clear that it was adviseable to prevent further Emissions, and to reduce the quantity in Circulation if it was possible to Effect it. The Delegate declared that when he offer'd his thoughts before that Illustrious assembly he did it with the greatest Diffidence and deference that he should not trouble them with any on so abstruce and Intricate a Subject as the present, but that he perceived the matter had not Struck any other in the same point of View that it did him. That he felt himself Oppressed with the Weight of the Question, and having the misfortune Singly to have the vote of one State to give he wished to do it on Established Principles, and the clearst Conviction. He therefore beged their Indulgence and candor if he should offer objections which had been answered in some former Debates (for there had been many on that Subject) which he had not the Good fortune to Hear. He urged that he had not been able to derive any Satisfactory Information from the Debate that the money could be had by way of Loan on any Interest, or that money raised by way of Loan would not be a further Emission in Effect. That he perceived that there were few or no money lenders in the Country, [. . .] that Farmers and Gentlemen speculated, and reserved their [money] for purchases, and Merchants, always relyed on employing (1)  ""

  Dr Sir, Baltimore Febry 8. 1777 I lately heard the Assembly of New Jersey had met but cannot learn where, am therefore unable to give a proper direction. The four New England Colonies have had a meeting of Committees from their Legislatures to consult measures for their mutual defence & for regulating Trade & Commerce. Their proceedings are before Congress, and I expect will soon obtain their Approbation, and recommendation will thereupon be sent to N. York, N. Jersey, Pensa. & Maryland to appt. Comees. to meet at Phila. for the purpose of regulating the Price of all Articles of Trade &c. The Southern States will also be desired to meet for that purpose. Those matters if passed you will soon have notice of.  I am much alarmed with Genl. Washingtons Procla. of the 25th Jany. He hath assumed the Legislative & Executive Powers of Government in all the states. I moved Congress to pass a Resolution I produced for preventing its fatal Consequences and the establishing such a precedent. My motion was Comtd. and is now before the Come.(1) I hope our Legislature will take proper Notice of it, whatever issue it may have in Congress and not tamely Submit their Authority to the Controul of a power unknown in our Constitution. We set out to Oppose Tyranny in all its Strides, and I hope we shall persevere.  A Regulation for providing Carriages for the Army & to prevent as much as possible the Custom of impressing hath long been before Congress, Comtd. & recomtd. and so it remains.(2) I Wish you will not delay passing a Law for Regulating impresses of this kind. The Devastations of New Jersey by the Enemy will I think make it Necessary to prevent Cattle &c running at large, as fences on the main road are mostly destroyed and cannot soon be made and I think, no person ought to be compelled to fence agst. street Cattel at any Time. Mr. Sergeant talks of resigning and Mr. Stockton by his late proceedure cannot Act,(3) I wish their places may be Supplied by such as will be reputable to New Jersey, not only by their integrity but Abilities.  The Tories in the two lower Counties of Maryland on the Eastern shore & Sussex on Delaware, are very troublesome and Collecting forces Aided by several Men of War in Delaware but more Especially in Chesopeak Bay. The Militia & two Continl Regiments are marching Against them.  I expect Congress will soon remove from hence to Lancaster, tho' it is not yet determined-if that should happen I shall be greatly perplexed  FEBRUARY 8, 1777  with the Chests. One Chief reason for removing is the Extravagant Price of Living here, the Poorest of board without any Liquor a Dollar a day, housekeeping 3/6 or 4/, Wine 12/ a bottle, Rum 30/ per Gall. and everything else in proportion and likely soon to rise. I am Dr Sir, with great Regard to your House, Your Obedt. & Humble Servt.  Abra. Clark P.S. The Price of living I only gave you as a piece of intelligence & not to Opperate in our favour, as upon Recollection I feared you might look upon it as interested.

  Dear sir, Baltimore Feby. 8th. 1777 I have the pleasure of informing you that your letter to Congress of the 4th instant (1) produced a Motion this day for adjourning to Philadelphia. After some debate it was resolved by a majority of one state only not to put the Question.(2) One state was accidentally unrepresented for a few minutes or it would have been carried in the Affirmative. The principal design of this letter is to request that you would urge the necessity of our returning to Philada. in your next letter. By our Absence from Philada. we not only depreciate the money there, but we likewise depreciate it by our residence here. The Scarcity of Artificers-the want of a sufficient number of boarding houses-the constant accession of Strangers who have business with the Congress and who create a fluctuation in the quantity of provisions brought into the town have rendered the price of living, and transacting business of all kinds three times as high in this FEBRUARY 8, 1777  place as it is in many parts of the continent and nearly twice as high as in Philadelphia. But there are Other considerations which ought to influence us. Our return will have the same effect upon our politicks that General Washington's late successes have had upon our Arms. Its Operation perhaps may not be confined to the Continent. It may serve our cause even in the Court of France.  Your letter produced another Motion in Congress of greater consequence than the one just now mentioned, namely to raise the interest of money received into our loan offices to 6 per Cent. It produced a very long, and serious debate. The question was postponed 'till Monday next at the request of Connecticut. There is good reason to believe from the part the several states took in the debate that it will be carried in the Affirmative by a majority of two or three states. Col. R H Lee has changed his mind upon this Subject, and was one of the warmest Advocates for raising the interest upon the floor.  We live here in a convent. We con[verse] only with One another. We are precluded from all opportunities of feeling the pulse of the public upon our measures. We rely upon the Committee of Philada. to feel it for us-and we expect once more to hear thro' you how it beats upon the  Subject of returning to Philadelphia. From Dr Sir your most humble Servt, B.

  Feby. 10. [1777] On motion to raise the interest of money to 6 per cent for loan office tickets,(1) it was said in the negative- 1 That there was no other way of laying out money.  2 That loan office tickets are the same as money, and therefore in case of the want of money new emissions are equally proper.  In the affirmative it was said by Mr Sergant, That loan office tickets would be confined only to one State.  By Mr. Jas. Wilson, That Bonds, lands &c. were transferrable as well as loan office tickets, and therefore the argument of their being the same as money is without force. That the money lenders had all their money paid in to them, that 3 millions had been received by the usurers in Pensylvania all of which was probably in thier hands, and that if the interest was raised to 6 per cent it wd. procure money.  Mr John Adams. That loan offices tickets would not circulate because they bore an interest. That Massachusetts Bay in the last war emitted 50,000 in notes bearing an interest of 6 per cent which were immediately locked up and withdrawn from the circulation even tho' gold & silver was plentiful among them. That new emissions would only encrease the difficulty, that the continent would bear only 7 millions. That Unless the interest was raised, the money holder would employ his money in speculation in buying lands, and in monopolising goods, by which means the necessaries of life were enhanced in thier price.

  My dear Sir Baltimore Feb 11. 1777 I beg Leave to inclose my Account of Expences from the 26th of April 1775 to the 27th of August 1776 amounting to .(1)  I intended to have laid it before the House of Representatives when I was last in New England, but the sudden Adjournment of the General Assembly in September, & my Hurry in preparing for my Journey hither after its sitting again in October, prevented my attending to it.  When I sat off from Lexington after the memorable Battle there, I had with me only the Cloaths upon my Back, which were very much worn; those which I had provided for myself being in Boston, and it was out of my Power then to recover them. I was therefore laid under a Necessity, in order to appear in any kind of Decency, of being at an extraordinary Expence for Cloathing and Linnen after my Arrival in Philadelphia, which I think makes a reasonable Charge of Barrils, Leonards and Stills Bills in my Account.  It may perhaps be necessary to say something of the Charge of Horse hire in the last Article. When I left Watertown in September 75, two FEBRUARY 11, 1777  Horses were deliverd to me out of the publick Stable by order of the Honbl Council, for my self and my servant. They were very poor when I took them, and both tired on the Road as you will observe by my Account. One of them afterwards died in Philadelphia, which obligd me to purchase another in that City; and with this Horse I returnd to Boston the last Fall. His being my own Property, having purchasd him without Charge to my Constituents, I think gives me a Right to make a Charge of horse hire, which is left to be carried out in a Sum whch shall be thought just and reasonable. Mr A tells me he is obligd to pay seven pounds 10/ for the Hire of each of his Horses to Philadelphia. The other horse I left at Boston (being worn out) to be disposd of as should be judgd proper.  I shall take it as a Favor if you will present the Account to the Honbl House, and acquaint the Committee to whom it may be referrd, with the Reasons of the Charges above mentiond; and make any other Explanations which you may judge necessary. Mrs A has the Vouchers, to whom I beg of you to apply for them in Person, before you present the Account. I wish it may be settled as soon as the House can conveniently attend to it. If an Allowance for my Services is considerd at the same Time, which I have a particular Reason to wish may be done, you will please to be informd, that I sat off from Lexington or Worcester, on the 26th of April 75 and returnd to Watertown on the 14th of August following. And again I sat off from Watertown on the first of September 75 and returnd to Boston on the 27th of August 76.  I have troubled you with this Epistle of Horse hire & Shop Goods, at a Time when, no doubt, your Attention is called to Affairs of the greatest Concern to our Country.

The Packets No. 2 I detained here & shall send them by the first Vessell. My reason for doing this was because I think they will leave this long before the others can get to Boston.  A Ship is just arrived from Nantes with Salt, the latest letters by her are dated the 16 Novr., at least those are the latest I have seen or heard of, there is none from Mr Deane, and Doctr Franklin cou'd not possibly be arrived at that date.

Of this I will Consider & Act for the best, but if in the mean time I receive any orders they shall be punctually obeyed. You had best send up dispatches to go by her both for Mr Bingham & for Paris.

  Dear Sir Baltimore Feb. 12. 1777 The Certificates and Cheque Books for the Loan office, I hope and presume, are arrived in Boston, before this Time, and notwithstanding the discouraging accounts which were given me, when I was there, I still hope that a considerable sum of money will be obtained by their Means.  It is my private opinion, however, that the Interest of four per Cent is not an equitable Allowance. I mean, that four per Cent, is not so much as the use of the money is honestly worth, in the ordinary Course of Business, upon an Average, for a year-and I have accordingly exerted all the little faculties I had, in endeayouring on Monday last, to raise the Interest to six per Cent.(1) But after two days debate, the Question was lost by an equal Division of the States present, five against five. New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay, New Jersey, Pensilvania and Virginia on one side, and Rhode Island, Connecticutt, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia, on the other. Here was an Example of the Inconvenience and Injustice of voting by States. Nine Gentlemen, representing about Eight hundred thousand People, against Eighteen Gentlemen representing a Million and an half nearly, determined this Point. Yet We must not be Startled at this.  I think it my duty to mention this to you, because it must be astonishing to most People in our State, that the Interest is so low. I know they are at a Loss to account for it upon any Principles of Equity, or Policy, and consequently may be disposed to blame their Delegates, but you may depend upon it, they are not in fault.  I tremble for the Consequences of this Determination. If the Loan offices should not procure us Money, We must emit more, which will depreciate all which is already abroad; and so raise the Prices of Provisions and all the Necessaries of Life, that the additional Expence to the Conti- FEBRUARY 12, 1777  nent, for supplying their Army and Navy, will be vastly more than the two per Cent in dispute. Besides all the Injustice, Chicanery, Extortion, oppression, and Discontent, which is allways occasioned every where by a depreciating Medium of Trade, I am much afraid of another Mischief. I fear that for want of Wisdom to raise the Interest in Season, We shall be necessitated within a few Months to give Eight or Ten Per Cent, and not obtain the Money We want after all.  I have been so often a Witness of the Miseries of this after Wisdom, that I am wearied to death of it.  Had a Bounty of Twenty dollars a Man been offered Soldiers last Time, it would have procurd more than the enormous Bounties that are now offered will procure. Had Government been assumed in the States Twelve Months sooner than it was it might have been assumed with Spirit, Vigour and Decision, and would have obtained an habitual Authority, before the critical Time came on when the Strongest Nerves of Government are necessary. Whereas now, every new Government is as weak as water and as brittle as Glass.  Had we agreed upon a Non Exportation, to commence when the Non importation commenced, what an immense Sum Should We have Saved? Nay very probably We Should have occasioned a very different House of Commons to be chosen, the Ministry to have been changed and this War avoided. Thus it is. You who will make no ill use of these observations may read them, but the Times are too delicate and critical to indulge freely in such speculations. It is best I believe that no mention Should be made, that the Rate of Interest has been again debated, lest Some Saving Men Should withold their Money, in hopes of compelling the Public to raise the Interest. If the Interest Should never be raised, those who lend in our State, will fare as well as others: if it Should, the Interest of all will be raised, that which is borrowed now, as well as that which shall be borrowed hereafter. I Sincerely wish that our People would lend their Money, freely. They will repent of it, if they do not. We shall be compelled to emit Such Quantities, that every Man except a few Villains will loose more by Depreciation, than the two Per Cent. Not to mention again the Scene of Anarchy and Horror, that a Continuation of Emissions will infallibly bring upon Us.  The Design of Loan offices, was to prevent the further Depreciation of the Bills, by avoiding further Emissions. We might have emitted more Bills promising an Interest but if those had been made a legal Tender, like the other Bills, and consequently mixed in the Circulations with them, they would instantly have depreciated all the other Bills four Per Cent, if the Interest was four, and more than that too, by increasing the Quantity of circulating Cash. In order to prevent these Certificates from Circulation and consequently from depreciating the Bills, We Should give them Such Attributes as will induce Men of Fortune and others, who usually lend Money, to hoard them up. The Persons who usually lend Money  are 1. Men of Fortune, who live upon their Income, and these generally chose to have a Surplusage to lay up every year, to increase their Capitals. 2. Opulent Merchants, who have more Money than they choose to risque, or can conveniently employ in Trade. 3. Widows, whose Dower is often converted into Money, and placed out at Interest, that they may receive an annual Income to live upon, without the Care and Skill which is necessary to employ Money advantageously in Business. 4. Orphans, whose Guardians seldom incline to hazard the Property of their Wards in Business. 5. A few Divines, Phisicians, and Lawyers, who are able to lay by a little of their annual Earnings. 6. Here and there a Farmer and a Tradesman, who is forehanded and frugal enough to make more Money than he has occasion to spend. Add to these 7. Schools, Colledges, Towns, Parishes and other Societies, which Sometimes let Money. All these Persons are much attached to their Interest and so anxious to make the most of it that they compute and calculate it, even to farthings and single days.  These Persons can get Six Per Cent, generally, of private Borrowers, on good security of Mortgages or Sureties.  Now, is it reasonable in the State to expect that monied Men will lend to the Public at a less Interest, than they can get from private Persons? I answer yes, when the Safety of the State is not in doubt: and when the Medium of Exchange has a stable value, because larger Sums may be put together, and there is less trouble in collecting and receiving the Interest and the Security is better. But the Case is otherwise, when Men are doubtfull of the Existence of the State, and it is worse still, when they see a Prospect of Depreciation in the Medium of Trade. All Governments in Distress are obliged to give an higher Interest for Money, than when they are prosperous.  The Interest of Money, always bears Some Proportion to the Profits of Trade. When the Commerce of a Country is Small, in few Hands, and very profitable, the Interest of Money is very high. Charles the fifth was necessitated to give twenty four Per Cent, after wards it fell in Europe to Twelve, and since to six, Five, Four, and Three.  I think I never Shall consent to go higher than Six Per Cent, as much as I am an Advocate for raising it to that, and in this I have been constant for full Nine Months. The Burthen of Six per Cent upon the Community will very soon be heavy enough. We must fall upon some other Methods of ascertaining the Capitals We borrow. A depreciating Currency, We must not have. It will ruin Us. The Medium of Trade ought to be as unchangeable as Truth: as immutable as Morality. The least Variation in its Value, does Injustice to Multitudes, and in proportion it injures the Morals of the People, a Point of the last Importance in a Republican Government.(2)  ""

  Feb'y 12th [1777] Maryland & Pennsylvania were very solicitous to procure a vote of Congress approving a Meeting lately held by Committees appointed by the four New England Governments, to the end that this approbation might imply a right to disapprove. It occasioned very long & interesting debates. At length the general opinion was that Congress had necessarily a right to inquire into the cause of any meeting, & to require to know what was transacted at any such meetings, & also to require an explanation of any thing that was dubious, & satisfaction for anything that was alarming to the whole, or any one of the States; that this right necessarily existed in their power to take care each for his respective State, that no in jury happened to her from without. But that Congress had no right to prohibit meetings, or censure them if the transactions in them were not injurious to others. The Delegate of North Carolina refused to say what his State could not do, declaring he thought she could do every thing which she had not precluded herself from by plain & express declaration: to yield up any of her rights was not in his power, & very far from his inclination. That by the Law of Nations she had a right to demand a satisfactory account & explanation Of any transactions of one or more States, & she had appointed him to watch lest any injury should come to her from without. In this he would use his best endeayours.

  Feb. 12th to l9th. 1777 Several days of this week are consumed in debates on the appointment of General Officers. The debates were perplexed, inconclusive, & irksome. The Delegates of several States were desirous of fixing a rule of promotion, & several were offered & rejected. Maryland, Virginia, & North Carolina desired that each State should recommend Officers in proportion to the men they furnish: three Battalions, one Brigadier; nine, one Major General. This was rejected. It was then proposed to promote General FEBRUARY 12, 1777  Officers as they stood in rank, & rejected. To all the rule a saving was added, that the Congress might deviate from any, in favor of merit eminently distinguished & generally acknowledged.  North Carolina argued that some rule should be observed, & entered on the Journals. That the Congress would be an object of very jealous apprehension, unchecked & unlimited as it is, if the officers of the army held their honor at the precarious pleasure of a majority. Officers hold their honor the most dear of any thing. Setting them aside when they were entitled to promotion would wound that honor very sorely. Their attention would therefore be entirely to that authority which had so much power to wound it, or to cherish it. This policy was always observed by Monarchs, & the end was to keep the Army dependant on them: but such policy was unbecoming in Congress, who ought to give no room for jealousy. The rule of succession is most familiar to officers & therefore most agreeable to them: but the proportion would give greatest satisfaction to the States, & the satisfying them was of greatest importance, & ought to be adopted.  At length it was proposed to resolve, that regard be had to the rank, to the quota, & to merit. It was agreed to, but no notice was taken of it in the nomination or appointments. N. Carolina did not vote for Major Generals: because the Delegate found, no rule was observed, & he knew nothing of the merit of any Officers in nomination, & did not choose to give a vote in Congress, for which he could give no reason.(1)  ""

  Dear David, Baltimore, Feb. 12, 1777.  Though I wrote you from Pequea lately,(1) and have not since heard from you, I could not omit saluting you by Mr. Baldwin. I have heard from Jos. Lane that you are well, and that you are lusty and grown much. That is a pleasing but very inconsiderable circumstance, compared with the accounts I had before, and confirmed by him, of your applying diligently to your business.(2) I wish you to be sensible how much joy I have  FEBRUARY 12, 1777  had from this information, and therefore often repeat it. My first concern is that you should fear God: and as about the new year, had we been at Princeton, I should have taken an opportunity to deal particularly and seriously with you and Fanny, as you know; so now that you are at a distance, I pray you to remember that the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom; and that it is now high time for you both, personally to renew your baptismal engagements, and solemnly give yourselves to God-I pray earnestly that he may renew you in the spirit of your minds. Next to the one thing needful, you know I am chiefly concerned for your improvement in useful knowledge, and fitness for the duties of active life; and I am persuaded by the taste you have taken, you will find the highest pleasure and the greatest honour by attending to your duty....(3)  Let this letter be common to you and Fanny, and to nobody else.  I am, dear David, Your affectionate father,  Jno. Witherspoon.  MS not found; reprinted from Christian Advocate 2 (October 1824): 444.  1 While staying at the home of Rev. Robert Smith, a relation by marriage, in Pequea, Pa., Witherspoon had written the following letter to David on February 2:  \""I doubt not you have all been sufficiently anxious about us, since the incursion of the enemy into New Jersey. I have just written to Mr. Smith the substance of what can be said of our present situation. I have been at Princeton, and find that by Mr. Montgomery's care, not many of my books are gone, and but little of the standing furniture is destroyed. John Goodman has been exceedingly careful and faithful about the farm; so that upon the whole, though I was the object of the enemy's distinguished hatred, I have escaped, through divine goodness, much better than I expected. I wrote in a long letter to Mr. Smith, from Baltimore, how we set off, bringing one wagon load of effects, and driving the four colts-they have been billeted in the neighbourhood here. Our sheep are all destroyed. There are, I think, old and young, fourteen of the cattle saved....  \""Your Mamma is well, and remembers you kindly. I need hardly tell you that our greatest comfort now is to hear of the welfare of our children. I t gives me unspeakable pleasure to hear that you apply to your studies, both in teaching and reading. You will find a vast advantage in the French now, for there are multitudes of Frenchmen come over, and almost every body is ambitious of learning the French. I am often employed as interpreter to those who come to the Congress, and have many visits from them. See, my dear child, that you lay the foundation of every thing that is good in the fear of God. Next, learn to improve time well, and be regular in the distribution of it.  \""I received your letter of the 20th of December on the 4th of January, but had just before written to Mr. Smith, you and Fanny. Be as accurate as possible in writing your letters, and take pains to improve your hand. I wish Fanny may employ herself this winter in something useful, and not spend the whole time in visiting and amusement....  \""James is aid de camp to General Maxwell, and if his life is spared, will be sufficiently provided for in the army. He was well the last time I heard from him. I shall expect to hear from you regularly by post to Baltimore, where I am going immediately.  \""I have been making inquiry into the conduct of the enemy, which has been dreadful. At Trenton they killed Mr. Roxburgh, Presbyterian minister at the FEBRUARY 13, 1777  Forks of Delaware. Though he fell down on his knees and begged his life, yet they pierced him through and through with their bayonets, and mangled him in a most shocking manner. Some of the people at Princeton say they thought they were killing me, and boasted that they had done it when they came back. But this is uncertain-the fact of his death and the manner of it is beyond all doubt. I must write a few lines to Fanny, and am, with my best respects to John Smith, Dear David, Yours, &c. Jno.

  Dear Sir Baltimore Feby 14. 1777 I received your agreable Scrawl of Jany 10th, & having decyphered it shall preserve the alphabet to explain your next. The Figures I am not yet Master of, there not being others to compare them with so that I am uncertain with respect to the Date whether it was the 10th or the 18th.(1)  I fully agree with You in thinking it necessary, that the Measures recommended by the Convention of the N E States for \""preventing Monopolies & Oppression\"" must at all Events be adopted. Trade it is true will regulate itself in ordinary Times & with a fixed Medium, but when it happens that a Community can be but partly supplyed with the Necessaries & Conveniencies of Life, it must be evident that without some Regulations the Merchant or Trader will have an vmbounded power to demand of the Wealthy what portion of their Interest he pleases for his Commodities & that these will not only be unreasonably plundered of their Money, but that the Distress must altogether fall on the poor who will not be able to relieve their Necessities untill all who have more property are fully satisfied. Add to this the Disadvantages of a fluctuating depreciating Medium & It is evident that the publick from Want of such Regulations must be loaded with Enormous Debts by Demands that will increase in proportion to the Extortion of the Merchants & Traders mentioned. Another Reason wch may evince the Necessity of such Laws [is?] when we consider that Foreigners have not only supplyed Us wth their Commodities at a most extravagent advance, but at the same Time have procured our produce at a much lower Rate than it was ever before sold at, whereby with a single Cargo a person may have secured to himself an independent Fortune. The Execution of such Laws are undoubtedly difficult but it being the Interest of such Multitudes to assist their operations, the Result will undoubtedly be diligently watched. We have sent two  FEBRUARY 14, 1777  Millions in Loan office Certificates to the NE States, but I doubt of Success with the Interest offered of 4 per Cent. We have also sent them half a Million of Dollars to pay the Bounty which will probably reach You e'er this. The Lottery Tickets are left with the Manager; why they are not sent to all the States, I know not, but shall move for Enquiry.  I should be sorry to hear of the loss of Ticonderoga but have no great Expectations from Fortifications of any Kind, if We are superior without, the Enemy will be soon subdued within, & the reverse must necessarily happen unless We preserve the Superiority mentioned.  I am glad to hear of the brass Foundery. Nothing is more essential than a good Train of Artillery & I hope You will push this Measure with vigour (2)  With respect to the Howitzer I agree with You both in their Usefulness on board Ships & in Fortifications, & cannot entertain a Doubt that Congress mean to have them procured at all Events; if there should be Time T will propose to Congress your Query & Transmit it with this Letter, otherwise I think You had best proceed & send them on agreable to former order.  Congress since their Session in this place have given General Washington large power, which You have undoubtedly seen as they were transmitted to the several States. They have augmented the Army to 116 Batalions, & order'd 2000 Horse & as many of the Train to be forthwith raised. D[r]. F[ranklin] is to go from F[rance] to the C[ourt] of M[adrid] & many other Measures with respect to foreign applications for Subsidies, & Treaties with other European powers, have taken place.

3250,dg006266,1777,Benjamin Rush s Notes of Debates,"""Benjamin Rush's Notes of Debates
  Feby. 14. 1777. Upon the question whether the Congress should recommend to the States to adopt the plan for reducing and regulating the price of labor, manufactures, imports, and provisions which had been adopted in the four New England States.(1)  It was said in the negative by Mr Jas Smith. That such a recomendation would interfere with the domestic police of each State which were of too delicate a nature to be touched by the congress.  Dr Rush. I am against the svhole of the resolution. It is founded in the contrary of justice, policy & necessity as has been declared in the resolution. The wisdom & power of goverment have been employed in all ages to regulate the price of necessaries to no purpose. It was attempted in Engd. in the reign of Edward II by the English parliament but without effect. The laws for limiting the price of every thing were repealed, and Mr Hume who mentions this fact records even the very Attempt as a monument of human folly. The congress with all its authority have failed in a former instance of regulating the price of goods. You have limited Bohea tea to 3/4 of a dollar, and yet it is daily sold before your eyes for 30s. The Committee of Philada limited the price of West India goods About a year ago. But what was the consequence? The merchents it is true sold their rum, sugar & molasses at the price limited by the committee, but they charged a heavy profit upon the barrel, or the paper which contained the rum or the sugar. Consider sir the danger of failing in this experiment. The Salvation of this continent depends upon the Authority of this congress being held as sacred as the cause of liberty itself. Suppose we should fail producing the effects we wish  FEBRUARY 14, 1777  for by the resolution before you. Have we any charecter to spare? Have we committed no mistakes in the management of the public Affairs of America? We have sir. It becomes us therefore to be careful of the remains of our Authority & charecter. It is a common thing to cry aloud of the rapacity & extortion in every branch of business & among every class of men. This has led some people to decry the public uirtue of this country. True sir there is not so much of it as we could wish, but there is much more that is sometimes allowed on this floor. We estimate our virtue by a false barometer when we measure it by the price of goods. The extortion we complain off arises only from the excessive quantity of our money. Now sir a failure in this Attempt to regulate the price of goods will encrease the clamors against the rapacity of dealers, and thus depreciate our public virtue. Consider sir the consequence of measuring our virtue by this false standard. You will add weight to the Arguments used at St James's to explode patriotism altogether, & by denying its existence in this country destroy it forever. Persuade a woman that there is no such thing as chastity, & if there is that She does not possess it, and She may be easily seduced if She was as chaste as Diana. Sir, The price of goods may be compared to a number of light substances in a bason of water. The hand may keep them down for a while, but nothing can detain them on the bottom of the bason but an Abstraction of the water. The continent labours under a universal malady. From the crown of her head to the Soal of her feet She is full of disorders. She requires the most powerful tonic medicines. The resolution before you is nothing but an Opiate. It may compose the continent for a night, but She will soon awaken again to a fresh sense of her pain & misery.  Col: Richd Henry Lee, in the affirmative. Mr President, The learned Doctor has mistook the disorder of the continent. She labours under a spasm, and Spasms he knows require palliative medicines. I look upon the resolution before you only as a temporary remedy. But it is absolutely necessary. It is true the regulations formerly recommended by Congress were not faithfully carried into execution, but this was owing to the want of regular governments. New & regular governments have been instituted in every part of America, and these will enable all classes of people to carry the resolutions into execution.  Mr Saml Chase, in the Affirmative. Mr President, This is a necessary resolution. It is true if failed formerly in Philada. because it Abounded with tories. But it succeeded in Maryland. It must be done. The mines of Peru would not support a war at the present high price of the necessaries of life. Your Soldiers cannot live on their pay. It must be raised unless we limit the price of the cloathing & other articles necessary for them.  Mr. Seargant-negative. The price of goods cannot be regulated while the quantity of our money and the articles of life are allowed to fluctuate.  This is & must be the case with us, therefore we cannot regulate the price of anything.  Col James Wilson, negative. Mr President, I differ from the gentleman from Virginia about the possibility of carrying the resolution before you into execution. The modern governments I am sure have not half the vigilance or Authority that the conventions & committees formerly had, and yet these failed in this business. Connecticut where the influence of good laws prevail greatly, adopted this plan with diffidence. There are certain things sir which Absolute power cannot do. The whole power of the Roman Emperors could not add a single letter to the Alphabet. Augustus could not compel old batchelors to marry. He found out his error, and wisely repealed his edict least he should bring his Authority into contempt. Let us recommend the resolution to the consideration of the states only without giving our Opinion on it, that they may discuss it with unbiased minds. Foreign trade is absolutely necessary to enable us to carry on the war. This resolution will put an end to it, for it will hang as a dead weight upon all the operations of external commerce.  Dr Witherspoon, negative. Sir, It is a wise maxim to avoid those things which our enemies wish us to practise. Now I find that our enemies have published the act of the asembly of Connecticut for regulating the price of necessaries in the New York paper in order to shew our distress from that Quarter. I believe the regulations would be just, if the quantity of money and the scarcity of goods bore an exact proportion to each Other. But the price of goods is by no means proportioned to the quantity of money in every thing. The encrease of price began 1st upon the Luxuries 2ly Necessaries, 3rd manufactories & 4ly grain, and Other produce of the earth. Now the reason why it has reached the grain &c last, is owing to their quantity being plentiful & to an overproportion of money. Remember laws are not almighty. It is beyond the power of despotic princes to regulate the price of goods. Tea & Salt are higher in proportion than any Other Articles of trade owing entirely to their price being limited. In Pensylvania salt was limited to 15s but was sold for 60s per bushel, while at the same time it was sold in Virginia where there was no limitation for 10s a bushel. I fear if we fail in this measure we shall weaken the Authority of Congress. We shall do mischief by teaching the continent to rest upon it. If we limit one article, we must limit every thing, and this is impossible.  Mr John Adams, Negative. Perhaps I may here speak agst. the sense of my constituents, but I cannot help it. I much doubt the justice, policy & necessity of the resolution. Its policy & necessity depend upon its practicability, and if it is practicable, I beleive it will be unjust. It amounts to the same as raising the value of your money to double its present value & this experiment was tried in vain even in the absolute goverment of France. The high price of many Articles arises from their scarcity. If we  FEBRUARY 15, 1777  regulate the price of imports we shall immediately put to stop to them for ever.  Dr Rush. Sir, It has been said that the high price of goods in Philada. arose from the monoplies, and extortion of the tories. Here I must say the tories are blamed without cause. A similar Spirit of Speculation prevails among the Whigs in Philada. They are disposed to realise thier money in lands, or goods, But this is not owing to any timidity or disaffection among them. They fear the further depreciation of your money by future emissions. Stop your emissions of money & you will stop Speculation, & fill your treasury from the loan Offices. I beg leave to inform Congress that the committee of Philada. was supported by the country people in thier Attempt to regulate the price of West India goods, but were notwithstanding unsuccessful. Now sir, the country people are equally concerned with the merchants in keeping Up the price of every thing, and in eluding laws for reducing them. I am not apt to reply to words much less to play upon them. The gentleman from Virginia has miscalled the malady of the continent. It is not a Spasm, but a dropsy. I beg leave to prescribe two remedies for it. 1 Raising the interest of the money we borrow to 6 per cent. this like a cold bath will give an immediate Spring to our affairs-& 2 taxation. This like tapping) will diminish the Quantity of our Money, and give a proper value to what remains.  The resolution was amended. The plan of the 4 New England states was referred only to the Other states, to act as they tho't proper.(2)  ""

Either original Sin is divisible or indivisible. If it was divisible every descendant of Adam and Eve must have a Part, and the share which falls to each Individual at this Day, is so small a Particle, that I think it is not worth considering. If indivisible, then the whole Quantity must have descended in a right Line, and must now be possessed by one Person only, and the Chances are Millions and Millions and Millions to one that that Person is now in Asia or Africa and that I have nothing to do with it.

  Feb. 15th. [1777] Yesterday was consumed in desultory debates upon a report of a special committee upon the proceedings of the four New England Governments above mentioned, & it was recommitted. This day it was brought in under a form agreeable to what was the sense of the House on what was yesterday considered. At first it expressed the opinion of Congress, that the proceedings were founded in justice, policy, & necessity, & merited the warmest approbation. The second declared neither approbation nor opinion except particularly relating to the New England Governments, because of their peculiar circumstances, but proposed laying it before the other States for their imitation if they thought proper, avoiding as much as possible any expression that might suggest to the States that Congress approved or disapproved. In this form it passed without a negative; & it was voted that several States should be advised to confer with each other on this subject: viz New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, & Virginia: North Carolina, South Carolina, & Georgia.(1) Nothing very remarkable happened in this debate except that Virginia insisted  FEBRUARY 15, 1777  Photographic reproduction of Resolves on the New England Convention  on being connected with Maryland, & refused to be connected with the Southern States. The Delegates present from Virginia were Richard Henry Lee, Francis Lightfoot Lee, & Mann Page, all residing on Rapphanock & Potowmack rivers. The Delegate from North Carolina represented that great part of the exportation of North Carolina was through Virginia, that her market was therefore in that State, & that she ought undoubtedly to be consulted in regulating the prices since she was so much interested therein: that it [was] unjust & ungenerous in Virginia to endeayour to regulate them without her, & evidently shewed she was willing to do what would affect the interest of North Carolina without her knowledge or consent. Virginia persisted, & the vote passed for her conferring with Maryland &c.  The question was now proposed for the conference of the Southern States. The Delegates opposed it, alledging that their articles of exportation would be always very low, by reason of the danger & difficulty of exporting: that none had provisions to spare but North Carolina, & her market for them being chiefly to Virginia, she was precluded from regulation in that article by the regulation made in Virginia, of which as she would have no notice she could not accommodate herself thereto, & her Delegate declared she had too much vigilance & sagacity to make any regulation, since it might preclude her from taking advantage of circumstances to defend herself from injustice of her neighbour Virginia: that since Virginia chose to confer with other States in making regulations which might affect North Carolina, & refused to confer with her where her interest was so nearly concerned, Virginia was entitled to no attention from North Carolina, & she ought to believe it in the power of her citizens to avail themselves of all advantages which circumstances might throw in their way. The Question put-all voted for the conference of the Southern States except their own Delegates.(2) R.H. Lee privately told the Delegate from North Carolina, that he need not be disturbed on this occasion, because Virginia could make no regulation but what must affect herself. The Delegate replied that it was arrogantly assuming to judge of her affairs, & affect them without her consent: it was taking advantage of her situation to be the arbiter of the commerce of North Carolina, & it was shewing an entire disregard to her interest & circumstances, & leaving them entirely to depend on the decisions of the Northern States, without even being consulted. The Delegate declared he thought this such an instance of contempt & disregard in Virginia, that he could not but receive it with indignation.  ""

I should be glad to be informed as early as possible what Sum will probably be collected among Us; and what the Sentiments of the Assembly are on the Interest which Congress have ordered to be given for Money borrowed by them. It seems that the Committee of the States of New England tho't the Interest of Four per Cent sufficient for the Purpose, and meant when the States should borrow Money to emit it at five per Cent, thinking that there was the Difference of One per Cent between continental and colonial security. As there may possibly be a Question about Increase of Interest hereafter I should be glad to be informed how high the Assembly thinks it would be proper for Congress to go in Order to answer their Purpose of collecting Continental Dollars by Loan Office Certificates in our State; for by their Sentiments I mean to be governed. At present it Stands at Four per Cent and I hope that an Increase of Interest will never become necessary; for thereby the Public Debt would be enhanced. Its continuing at four per Cent depends greatly upon the Encouragement that the Assemblies of the Several States shall give to the Loan Office. Our State will I dont doubt pay as they have ever done a due Regard to the Resolutions of Congress; for it is her Interest to stand well with the superintending Power of these States. Congress have taken into Consideration the Doings of the Committee of the New England States, and have approved of the Measures taken for the Defence of the State You Govern, of the Regulation of the Prices of Articles of Produce &c, and have recommended it to the other States in the Union to take such Measures for regulating and fixing the Price of Provisions &c as they may think expedient. They approved also of the Embargo; but disapprove of the Emission of Paper Money by the States. This is, as well as I can recollect, the Substance of the Resolves, for they past this Day and I have not been able to get a Copy of them. They will be published; but as I know it will give the State great Pleasure to be assured that Congress approve of the Measures taken for its Defence, as that Approbation involves in it the Idea of paying the Expence thereof, I cannot forbear giving you the earliest Intelligence of it.(1)  A Question of considerable Importance was started on considering the Doings of the Committee. A resolve was moved for in some such Form as this-Resolved that as the Communication between Congress & the New England States was interrupted, and the State of Rhode-Island was threatend with an Invasion or actually invaded Congress considering the Necessity of their taking Measures for their Defence approve of their  FEBRUARY 15, 1777  Meeting &c. The Advocates for the Motion went upon this Principle that none of the United States have a Right to meet without the prior or subsequent Approbation of Congress; those that took the other Side of the Question asserted that any Two or more of the States have a Right to meet for the Purpose of consulting upon Matters relative to themselves; and after a long metaphysical Debate which took up Part of three Days Congress were equally divided. All the Members agreed that the Meeting was right considering the Circumstances; but split upon the Question of Right hinted at.(2)  The Two Armies remain in the same Situation they did. Ours at Morris Town and the British Army at Brunswick. There have been lately two or three Skirmishes, in One of which We should have defeated the Enemy and taken a Number of their Waggons had it not been for the Cowardice of a Colo. Buckner of Virginia. However We did not loose a Man, but the Enemy by the Account given by the Country People had their Colonel Commandant killed and a Major wounded, and between 20 and 30 Privates killed. In another altho' the Enemy's Detachment consisted of upwards of 2000 with 8 Field Peices; and ours only of 700 without a Field Peice; yet it seems that after repeated Brushes, they retired about a Quarter of a Mile from the Enemy, made a stand and the Enemy withdrew. We lost an Officer or Two and about 12 Soldiers. The British it is said suffered most. Our Army on the East Side of Hudsons River have been compelled by the Inclemency of the Season to retire to White Plains. The Enemy have suffered greatly for Want of Forage and are like to suffer more. There is no Danger of their attempting to pass the Delaware very suddenly. Congress talk of returning to Philadelphia. I hope my next will be dated at that City. I shall rejoice when I get near the Scene of War, and out of this expensive dirty Town.  I wait with Impatience to hear something clever from our State. The last Account from thence is very disagreeable. A Mr. Nesey hath sent a Story to the Marine Committee something like this, that the Diamond Frigate ran ashore upon Warwick Neck, that Commodore Hopkins ordered the Sloop Providence, upon receiving this Intelligence down the River, that after firing some Shot into her Stern the Sloop returned to the Fleet, that the Diamond after lying aground 36 hours, if I remember aright, got off, that the Wind was fair to run down the River, and therefore the Diamond could not receive any Assistance or Support from the Brit[is]h Fleet, and that our Fleet lay at Anchor and suffered the Diamond to go off, altho' they were but 6 Miles distant from her. I cannot believe this Account because I cannot believe that the Commander in Chief of the American Navy would let an Opportunity slip by him so favorable for taking or destroying a Frigate, and so favorable for acquiring Glory; nor can I believe that the Army would suffer a Ship to ly aground so long  unattacked when with Two or Three Field Peices they might blow her to Peices.(3)  I don't hear any Thing about an additional Delegate, nor a Word about the Resolve of Decr. fixing the Salary of the Delegates. A Delegate ought to be appointed, if it is not already done, and I am sure not a Member of the Assembly who considers the amazing Rise of Board and every Article of Life will think it unreasonable to alter that Resolve and raise the Salary from that Time. It may be relied on that I should never have dropt a Word about it, if I had thought it competent.  Heartily wishing for the Prosperity of the State of Rhode Island, the Success of our Cause and the Establishment of Independency I continue to be with great Respect, Yr Honor's most Obedt. humble Servant,  William Ellery P.S. The Money for the Bounty of our new Levies is sent to the Paymaster of the Eastern Department.  ""

3256,dg006272,1777,John Hancock to Samuel Langdon,"""John Hancock to Samuel Langdon
  Gentlemen, Baltimore Feb. 15 1777 I am honoured by a letter from the Revd. Mr President Langdon by Mr Hall, of December 16 which I received Feb. 7 [. . .] Inclosing several resolutions of the Hon. Board of Overseers, with the subsequent votes of the Corporation of Harvard College, of which I was once respected as a member.(1) I am much obliged to the President for the compliment in the latter part of his letter, as to my publick conduct unconnected with the college, but in justice to my own reputation, as interested and concerned in the government of that society, and being intrusted with their funds by their unsolicited and unexpected appointment, I am constrained to say that the other parts of the President's letter as also of his letter of April 30th, 1776,(2) with the votes of the Board of Overseers and the votes of the corporation consequent thereupon, carry such a severe and unmerited censure on me, that I think I am justified in requesting an explanation. I am in the first place called upon by the President for an immediate compliance with the resolves of the overseers. The overseers require a delivery of all papers, obligations, etc, to such person as the corporation shall appoint for that purpose, and adjourn till the first Wednesday in Jany. for the purpose of receiving and examining my accounts, with a dependence that by that time those accounts would be laid before them. The corporation in consequence appoint Mr. Hall to proceed wherever Mr. Hancock may be and receive the bonds, etc. Have I ever, Gentlemen, refused to comply with the requisitions of the overseers or have I not ever paid an implicit obedience to all their requests? The time to which the overseers adjourned for the liquidation of my accounts was elapsed before I received the summons by Mr. Hall, and next, the direction to Mr. Hall to proceed wherever Mr Hancock may be, these circumstances carry an implication, highly disreputable to me. Surely I did not run away with the Property of the College, No Gentlemen, I served it. I could have wished that the particular situation of my affairs & my own constant attention to the business of my Department had prevent so sudden an application at least that I should not have been so suddenly dismissed without even the privilege of resigning, If I had been disposed to resign. I received a letter in October from Mr. Bowdoin on this subject, and wrote him an answer, inclosed to Mr Bant, acquainting him that I would send the papers as soon as possible,(3) the different turn to our affairs after that, and the danger of travelling, with the additional business in Congress in consequence of the retreat of our Army, prevented my attention to that business: since that letter I have heard nothing, till Mr. Hall's arrivall, and altho' I have been obliged to improve nights for the purpose, I have complied with the requisition and have sent down the bonds to my regular attorney Mr William Bant in Boston, a gentleman for whose integrity, capacity and honour, I will be answerable. I have FEBRUARY 15, 1777  sent him also a list of the bonds as examined by Mr. Hall, my secretary & myself. Mr. Bant will wait on you at such time & place as you shall please to appoint for the examination and reception of the bonds, if found right you will please to give him duplicate receipts for each bond with the sum and amount of the svhole, unless you should choose to continue them in his hands to follow your direction, he acting under me in the appointment you made of me for the office, but if you see fit to dismiss me, for I cannot resign under the present circumstances, you will of course receive the bonds, and give him a receipt, in which case I shall employ some more nights in completing my accounts & forwarding it to Mr Bant, that he may make a final settlement. I think it proper now to mention to you, that I have no demand upon you, neither shall I make any for the salary as Treasurer, or any expense I have been at, & further to inform you that I have given directions to Mr. Bant to pay every Iota of expense that shall arise in consequence of Mr. Halls journey; I have paid him here, his whole expense from his leaving you to this day, & Mr. Bant has my orders to pay the remainder, and I have asked Mr. Hall to exhibit his accounts to Mr. Bant for payment, as I cannot suffer it to be said that the College lost one farthing by me, tho' it gain nothing by me. I have been happy in the company of Mr. Hall, my situation and the obligation I am under to be very assiduous in my attention to the business & calls of my department, must apologize to him that I have not been more attentive to him, and must apologize to you that I have not more early dispatched him. I have ever had a most sincere regard for the seminary in which you preside, I will never prejudice it, but unless permitted by an explanation, I shall never trouble it.  I have the honour to be with sentiments of esteem, Gentlemen, Your ( injured ) most obed. & hum Set. J.H.  [P.S.] I am apt to think there are a few more Bonds in another package of papers which I will not now detain Mr Hall for, as I shall send them to Mr Bant, by a careful hand who goes in a few days. I have never unpacked any of the papers until since Mr. Halls arrival.  ""

  Honble Gentlemen, Baltime Febry. 15th. 1777  The Honour confer'd upon me by Appointing me one of your Delegates in the American Congress, as it is a very distinguished one, so it has always been cherish'd by me with the greatest Satisfaction. I am led therefore by Duty and Inclination to Discharge the Trust Reposed in me, untill the Period Arrives when it will Devolve into the hands of those who gave it. But there are some Circumstances which Oblige me to Solicit your Indulgence in permitting me to Return to Boston for a short time.(1)  It cannot be unknown to you, Gentlemen, that very soon after my Appointment to a Seat in Congress, I had the honour of being call'd to preside in that Assembly, in which Department I have endeavour'd to Execute the Arduous and extensive Business Annexed to it, in the most faithfull manner, and to the best of my Abilities, but whether with Reputation or not, my American Brethren, as they must finally Determine, to them I willingly submit my Conduct. This much however I may Assert, that I have spared neither Attention or Labour to Satisfy the wishes of Congress; and so unremitted has been my Application to the Duties of the Chair since my Appointment to it, that I have never been Absent a single hour.  Such close Confinement both in Congress, and out of it, having at length considerably impair'd my Health, and feeling it decline every Day, I am induc'd to Ask your Consent to Visit my Native Country, with a view to spend a few Weeks, in hopes the Benefit of the Ride, and Relaxation from Business will Restore my Constitution and Relieve my complaints.

  Dear Joseph Halifax Monday February 15. 1977 Here I arrived late yesterday after a most fatiguing Journey all the way on Horseback from Baltimore hither. An unremitting attendance upon congress all day and upon committees on Evenings during the solitary representation of North Carolina by degrees impaired my accustomed stock of health and at length brought on a fever which for several days baffled the Skill of Doctor Wirzinthale and the power of medicine. It had a crisis which proved fortunate, I took the advantage of an Intermission and resumed my seat in Congress & Relapse was the Consequence & I had very nearly measured my length under Ground in that worst of all terrestrial places, a situation bad as it is yet preferable to being above it long in that wretched place. I have not yet recovered, I was broiling in a fever all last night & I can scarce muster strength to get on horseback tho I propose to go on this day.  Burke came to my relief on Saturday the first day of February and your express delivered me your packet about two hours before Burke appeared. Your Express with the fatigue of his Journey and from other causes found himself much indisposed and from this and his apprehension of the Small pox was averse to proceeding to Philadelphia. Fortunately, the next morning two congress expresses set off, one for Philadelphia to return the next Saturday-the other for Boston to return as soon as might be. Your letters for Philad I gave to the former & wrote R Morris who was there & your Brother to dispatch answers by the return Express under Cover to Mr Hancock for you. Your Letter to the Governour of Mass'tts went by the Boston express. I gave directions to Mushraw to call upon Mr Hancock on Saturday for any letters which might come to him for you & if any were not arrived to wait till they did & then proceed immediately to Edenton. I apprized Mr Hancock of this measure so that no mistake can occur in the Conduct of it. Your letter to the President &c were layed before Congress, a Committee at my request appointed, & by Mushraw as soon afterwards in a letter by Burke you will know the Result.(1)  Freeman Payne whom you mention as the owner of the Privateer is a fellow who was employed in Rh. Island by the State of South Carolina to recruit Sailors. They intrusted him with a Sum of money which he applied to his own uses in the purchase of a privateer. He has preyed upon all the World & is said now to be worth 30,0002 the fruits of his pious labours. I prevailed upon the N Eng. delegates to write long ago to Boston; as yet they can hear nothing of the arrival of the Privateer or his plunder. FEBRUARY 15, 1777  The North Carolina Regiments as well the 6 in So Carolina as the three new ones here are ordered to join G Washn. as soon as it can be effected.(2) He is distressed for want of men, has not I fear 7000 & many of those are militia when the Enemy are 10,000 Strong & are prevented attacking him only from want of Cannon.  A Col Buckners Cowardice prevented our getting possession of 3 Rgts of the Enemy & perhaps 100 Waggons loaded with provisions. His Lieut Col Josiah Parker fought like a Hero, killed the Col Commandtan]t of the Enemy & the second Col & would have totally routed them if Buckner had come up to his assistance with 400 Men which he had with him while Parker maintained the unequal conflict with 200 agt the whole force of the Enemy. Buckner ran off it is said, He is of Virginia, is under Arrest & I think will have the honor of dying by a Bullet tho not in the Bed of Honor.(3)  The French begin to shew their teeth. They have spared us 200 brass Cannon, 30,000 Musquets, 100 Ton of powder; Salt petre & 1/2 Million of livres. Genl Coudray is coming out with several of the French Nobility. Dean (entre nous) says if We hold out this Summer, France must declare for us in the fall. I inclose you George's Speech. See he trembles for his Kingdom-but I can no more. You may shew this to my friends Johnston, Iredell & Smith to whom give my love. If they & you can read it you have the Advantage of your affectionate, Wm Hooper  [P.S.] I furnished your express Mushraw with 10£ proc. or 25 Cont dollars, remember it in your settle with him. Below is the Copy of a Resolve (4) which concerns Mr Johnston, the Govs Warrant should be sent immediately & the board of War will send on the Money.  I forget to tell you that Fras. Nash was made a Brig. Genl & is to go to the Northward.(5) Write me to Wilmington immediately. I will send you the Resolve as to our Troops as soon as I can get any one to copy it.

  Sir Philadelphia 15th February. 1777 I hope this will soon be delivered to you after despatched from hence as I have received directions from the Marine Committee at Baltimore to send you on a different service to that which the Orders I gave you before you left fort Island directed.(1)  With this you will receive Letters for William Bingham Esqr the Continental Resident at Martinico and you are immediately to proceed for that Island and deliver said Letters, the purport of them are that he should ship on board your ship, a quantity of Arms, Ammunition, Cloathing and other Stores that we suppose will be lodged there previous to your Arrival. If you find that Mr. Bingham has it in his power to comply with this requisition, you are forthwith to receive on board all such stores as he may desire and return with the utmost expedition to the Coast of America in order to get them landed in some safe place, from w hence they can be transported by land to our Armies or Magazines. These supplies are exceedingly necessary for the service of the ensuing Campaigne and you cannot render your Country a more essential service than by bringing them soon and safe in. Should it so happen that these expected Supplies are not arrived at Martinico or that Mr. Bingham has but A Small portion of them, you may take on board what he has and then proceed to St. Eustatia, first consulting with Mr. Bingham on the propriety of this measure. At St. Eustatia you will call on Mr Samuel Curson, Mr. Corneilus Stevenson and Mr Henricus Godet with the letters herein and if they have any of the expected stores receive them on board & should these make quantity or value sufficient return to America from thence, but should you be disapointed here also, you will then proceed to the Island Curacoa and deliver the enclosed Letter to Mr. Isaac Governeur; and should you find at this Island Mr John Philip Merkle of Amsterdam who Will be at Mr Governeurs; you may consult with him and Mr. Governeur whether it is better to take him and his goods on board the Randolph or to ship his goods on board other fast sailing Vessels to come on the Coast under your Convoy; and do therein what shall seem best to them and yourself, but be sure to bring them Safe. Should it so happen that Mr Merkle is not at Curacoa, nor any of his goods you will then proceed to Cape Francois and deliver the Letter herewith to Mr Stephen Ceronio. If he has goods or Stores receive them on board, but failing of sufficient there you will go to the Mole St. Nicholas, deliver the Letter herewith to Mr John Dupuy, take in what he has to ship, and then make the best of your way back to the Continent.  As you command the first American frigate that has got out to sea, it is expected that you contend warmly on All necessary occasions for the honor of the American flag. FEBRUARY 15, 1777  At every foreign port you enter salute their forts and waite on the Governor, General or Commander in Chief, asking the liberty of their ports for the Ships of the United States of America. Take care that your people do not molest their Trade nor Inhabitants nor in any shape disturb that good understanding we have with them.  Should you take any prizes in the West Indies that are bona fide British property within the discriptions of Prizes as laid [down] by Congress, you may send them into Martinico to the care of William Bingham Esqr.-to St. Eustatia to the care of Saml. Curson junr. Esqr.-at Curacoa to Mr Governeur-at the Cape Francois to Mr Ceronio, at St. Nicholas Mole to Mr John Dupuy, observing that if any part of the Cargoes suit the consumption of the West Indies, and not consisting in such articles as are wanted here, the Agents of the Prizes may make sale of all such goods and apply the Neat proceeds to the purchase of such supplies as we are in want of, and we will pay here that part of the amount that appertains to you, your officers and Crew, but the Ships must be sent to some port in these States for Condemnation with a Compleat Inventory of what has been taken out, any Prize you take that you think may be disputed or appealed for, must be sent for the States without breaking bulk. The Agents at each place will make the necessary supplies for the charges and expences of your Ship, but you are not to pay any Custom House fees or duties any where. You must encourage as many Seamen as possible to enter on board your Ship at every port you enter and from every prize you take. As the British Men of War on the West India stations are not often well manned, it would give great eclat to our Naval service if you can make prize of one or more of them, and if so you will do well to tempt some of their best Warrant officers such as Boatswains, Gunners, Quarter Masters and their several mates to enter our service, for we would wish you to bring both these and plenty of Common Sailors home to assist in Manning our other Ships of war. When your errand to the West Indies is compleated, you'l observe it is mentioned already that you are to return to some safe port in these United States of America. The uncertainty of the fate of war makes us cautious of saying positively which shall be the best port. There is little doubt but this will be the most convenient to receive the Stores at, being most Centrical and probably not very distant from the Scenes of Action, and as you are well enabled to defend yourself against most single ships, and capable we hope of outsailing any of the enemies it appears that you might venture to call at Cape Henlopen or Cape May for intelligence without incurring the charge of rashness, and we will endeayour to keep out some small Cruizers about the time you are expected to give you information. To these you'l shew the Signals mentioned in your letter of the 6th instant to me but least you should forget to keep a Copy I shall repeat that \""you are to be known to small Cruizers by a White Jack at the fore top mast head and a pendant over it.\"" Shew this same Signal to the Light House and we will send down   orders there to answer it by a White sheet if All is well, but to hoist English Colors if you are in danger, and as it is probable some more of the Continental frigates may be out and Cruizing on the Coast, I shall enclose you herein some Signals by which Continental frigates may be known to each other by day or by night, as Copies shall be furnished to each of the Captains and you will duely observe your part of them.

  Dear Sir Philada. Feby 15th. 1777 I am favoured with your letters of the 8th & 11th Inst. & am very sorry the Congress shou'd persist in an error, that experience shews plainly to be such. I was at the pains to get two Gentn going to Boston with a large  FEBRUARY 15, 1777  Sum of Money to deposite it in our loan Office & take Certificates bearing four per Cent interest rather than the money. To induce them to do this I told them none had been yet sent to the Eastern States & they wou'd readily obtain the money for these Notes as they wanted it, but to guard against disapointments I gave them letters to the Continental agents requesting their assistance if necessary & telling them the Gentlemen must not be disapointed because they had taken this step to promote the public Service & under my assurance that they shoud not suffer by it. Mr Bradford writes me from Boston that it will be extreamly difficult to obtain money for those notes (about 60000 Dollars) because the Treasurer of that State is taking in all the money he can get & giving Treasury Notes for it at six per Cent. Here the People who are willing the Continent shou'd have their money refuse it possitively because they cannot afford to reduce their income, especialy as the price of living is more than doubled, in short if the Congress do not embrace this measure at once they are undone, every department of Public business is in want of money, they cannot make it fast enough & if they will not borrow on the terms other People do, what must follow. When four per Cent was agreed on I was in favour of it, only, because I thought the immense summ in Circulation wou'd oblige the great holders of it to lodge it in the Public Funds and be glad to get it there, but now that experience shews us our Credit is not well established, that our money is greatly depreciated, and at the same time our Necessitys are daily encreasing, I wonder upon what principle it is that any Gentleman can expect a supply by loan equal to those necessitys. I am told the Southern States object & think they shall pay the Interest & the others receive it, but this is a phantom, whilst they Continue to raise such Valuable Commodities as Indico, Rice & Tobacco, they will Command their share of the Riches of the Continent and discharge their debts with more facility than their Neighbours. I cannot urge further than I have already done in the public letters from the Committee, the return of Congress to this City lest we be suspected of motives that I treat with great Contempt. Philadelphia Can do as well without as with the Congress, but I am Confident they cannot do as well out of as in it. For my own part I mean in all my Conduct to promote the general Interest of America & lay onside local attachments except in such instances as they become a duty. My inclination prompts me to decline a public Station, but being called on I cannot gratify myself, when the consequence will be to deserve blame from the Worthy part of those that are embarked with me in this Cause & you may depend I will not spare my exertions to Serve & Save my Country.

  My Dear Sir, Baltimore 15th Feby 1777 My last (1) accompanied the money from the Marine Committee viz 42,000 dollars, but as this goes by Express to Boston it may come first to hand. The last letter I rec'd from you was 27th Decr.  There are still a number of the enemy's ships in Chesapeak Bay though some vessels do get past them both inward & outward bound and some have fallen into their hands. It will be prudent to order the vessels you send this way to call in at some of the inlets between Cape Henlopen and Cape Charles w here they may get information of the enemy's ships. Delaware Bay is at present open, but there is no knowing how long it will be so. The Randolph is sailed and the Delaware will sail soon and the Virginia from this place in about two weeks. A ship is arrived at Philadelphia from France, but brings no public letters; but a private letter of the 9th Novr. says France and Spain are making the greatest preparation for War ever known; England is also exerting every nerve to get a formidable fleet at sea. Holland has likewise ordered 12 ships of the line to be got ready as soon as possible. These things justify an opinion that a general war is not far off. The Tyrant of Britain's speech tells us he is endeavoring to conciliate matters between Spain and Portugal so we find that dispute is not yet settled. I hope a few days will bring us important and agreeable intelligence from Europe. That I may soon have it in my power to transmit you such as will expel every anxious thought is the wish of your very sincere friend and humble Servant, W Whipple  [P.S.] Congress begin to talk of removing to Philadelphia again. I think it probable they will do so shortly.  ""

  My dear Sir Baltimore Feb. 16. 1777 A few days ago, a small Expedition was made by the Authority of this State aided by a Detachment of Continental Regulars, to suppress the Tories in the Counties of Somerset & Worcester on the Eastern Shore of Chessapeak, where they are numerous and have arisen to a great Pitch of Insolence.(1) We this day have a Rumour that one of their Principals, a Doctor Cheyney, is taken and we hope to hear of the Business being effectually done, very soon. In my opinion, much more is to be apprehended from the secret Machinations of these rascally People, than from the open Violence of British and Hessian Soldiers, whose Success has been in a great Measure owing to the Aid they have receivd from them. You know that the Tories in America have always acted upon one System. Their Head Quarters used to be at Boston-more lately at Philadelphia. They have continually embarrasd the publick Councils there, & afforded Intelligence, Advise and Assistance to General Howe. Their Influence is extended throughout the united States. Boston has its full share of them, and yet I do not hear that Measures have been taken to suppress them. On the Contrary, I am informd that the Citizens are grown so polite, as to treat them with Tokens of Civility & Respect. Can a Man take Fire into his Bosom, and not be burned? Your Massachusetts Tories communicate with the Enemy in Britain as well as New York. They give and receive Intelligence, from whence they early form a Judgment of their Measures. I am told they discoverd an Air of insolent Tryumph in their Countenances, and saucily enjoyd the Success of Howes Forces in Jersey before it happend. Indeed, my Friend, if Measures are not soon taken, and the most vigorous ones, to root out these pernicious Weeds, it will be in vain for America to persevere in this generous Struggle for the publick Liberty.  General Howe has declared that he intends that General Lee shall be tried by the Laws of his Country. So he is considerd as a Deserter from the British Army-You know the Resolution of Congress concerning this Matter. It is my opinion that Lt Colo Campbel ought immediately to be secured. He is to be detaind as one upon whom Retalliation is to be made. FEBRUARY 16, 1777  Would you believe it, that after the shocking Inhumanities shown to our Countrymen in the Jerseys, plundering Houses, cruelly beating old Men, ravishing Maids, murdering Captives in cold Blood, and systematically starving Multitudes of Prisoners under his own Eye at New York, this humane General totally disavows his own winking at the Tragedy, and allows that a few Instances may have happend which are rather to be lamented.  Congress is now busy in considering on the Report of the joynt Committees of the Eastern States. A curious Debate arose on this Subject, which I have not time now to mention. I will explain it to you in my next. Adieu my Friend, S A  ""

  Sir Baltimore Feby. 1 6th 1777. My last to you was by Mr Hooper, & I suppose you have received it long before this.(1) I then announced my intention of troubling you every post & I now sit down in order to perform, in some part, my promise.  Of the political principles of the respective States I am not yet able to speak very clearly, for they are kept as much as possible out of view. I conjecture however, that all are under some apprehensions of combination in the Eastern States to derive to themselves every possible advantage from the present war, at the expence of the rest. I am not yet satisfied that there is any combination amongst them. I rather think that they only combine when they have one common interest, which is seldom the case, & I am sure this is not peculiar to them. On some late questions I observed they divided: one was relative to the interest to be paid on Loans, another relative to meeting of several States. In the sequel of this letter I mean to give you an abstract of the debates on these questions,(2) & therefore shall say no more of them here. But, sir, I am more concerned to find that Pennsylvania, Maryland, Jersey, & some others are exceedingly jealous of the states whose bounds to the westward are yet unascertained, & I am much mistaken if they do not upon all occasions endeayour to fix very extensive powers in a mere majority of Congress in order to get resolutions unfavourable to the claims of such states entered into. To be more explicit, I believe they will endeayour by degrees to make the authority of Congress very extensive, & when it shall be fully established & acknowledged, to make such a party in it as will pass resolves injurious to the rights of those States who claim to the South Seas. You will see by some  FEBRUARY 16, 1777  matters in the abstract of debates which I shall subjoin, that this conjecture is not quite void of foundation. I am clearly of opinion at all events that those States who, like ours, have such claims should be explicit in declaring they will give no power to their Delegates to bind them in any thing that regards their Bounds.  I am not yet able to be particular with respect to the measures intended to be pursued. We are endeayouring to forward, by every expedient, the recruiting service, & also the putting our Frigates to sea. Our greatest difficulty is in supplying the Treasury. This requires the nicest management. If we go on emitting money, the quantity in circulation so enhances the prices of things, that we shall only make more money without being able to get for it more commodities, & it will, of course destroy its own purpose. The Loan Office is at length considered as little better than new emissions, & a Tax seems the only adequate expedient. There is a plan under consideration for this purpose: when it shall be determined I will be more explicit. You will receive from the President a copy of some transactions in the New England Governments, together with the Resolutions of Congress relative thereto. You will perceive that the intention of sending them to the diffierent States is to suggest to them to fall on methods something similar, if they see it proper & necessary. Tho' no States are more in need of such regulations than where the armies march through, yet they opposed it, under the pretence that regulating prices would be impracticable; but a majority of Congress were of opinion that it might be rendered so far effectual as to prevent engrossers, & forestallers, & speculators, who purchased in hopes of a rising price, & thereby rendered necessary articles very scarce, & difficult to be obtained. For my thoughts on this subject, I will refer you to the abstract of debates, that is so far as regards our own State. I indeed have no great opinion of an attempt to regulate prices in a country where the holders are under no necessity of selling; but knowing our own State u as not much interested in this business, I voted for it, in order to damp the practice of speculative monopoly which prevails in all the Northern States. You will see in the abstract my reasons for not approving it in ours. I really feel myself much displeased at the disregard Virginia shewed to our interest in this matter, & I believe, were I a member of your assembly I should move that she might be desired to avow or disavow the conduct of her Delegates in Congress. But this I need not urge to you, who are so good a judge of her interest, so jealous of her honour, & so careful to maintain her rights.  We have just received some very agreeable intelligence from the army, but I expect it will be in the paper before I can close this letter; If not I will procure abstracts & enclose them to you. There are some Tory disturbances on the Eastern Shore of this State, & the Civil Power do not seem to proceed with sufficient vigour against them. There [are] some   Troops however sent against them, & I suppose my next will contain something final relative to them. I take abstracts of all the important debates in Congress, principally with a view of transmitting them to you. I think it right that my country should know how I give her voice, & upon what principles I determine for her. If I am right her approbation will not only determine me, but others also to proceed with firmness. If I am mistaken she, only, can correct me, & by correcting me inform others more fully of their duty. I doubt not the candor of my countrymen, they will believe I act for them to the best of my judgment, & where that judgment errs I am desirous it should be better instructed by them, or if they find it defective & unfit for their service, 'tis surely right they should have an opportunity of substituting a better in so important a trust.  The intelligence above mentioned is in the paper; it is that under the Philadelphia head, February the 15th, but I am sorry to tell you it is contradicted by later accounts. We have received authentic intelligence from London that Chesapeake Bay is next campaign to be the seat of war, & the enemy mean to land first on the Eastern Shore. The Tories in Somerset & Worcester are broken, & the persons who chiefly excited them are taken prisoners. The Congress have resolved to adjourn on Tuesday from this town to Philadelphia, to sit there on the Tuesday following.(3)  I have the honour to be, Your Excellency's most obed. serv't, Thos.

  Dear Sir Philadelphia Feby. 16th. 1777  I wrote you a few lines the 12th Inst. by Mr Sargenton's Sloop. That Vessell happened to arrive here in the midst of our fright when I advised Mr Blaquiere to send her down to Wilmington from whence the Cargo might be sent over Land to Baltimore or Lancaster in case of need he did so, and remained there untill our Panic ceased and the Enemy were driven back to Brunswick. He then came up here again & finding me so exceedingly engaged that I coud not possibly pay due attention to his business, he got the Assistance of Mr Daymon and they have transacted it.  When you went away I thot. my time woud not be so engrossed but that I might as usual manage Commission business, however I see it is impossible especially with such troublesome people as French SuperCargoes &c. Therefore I now request you will not give yourself the trouble to sollicit any Coms. business for me as I chuse to decline it unless what I do for you and such persons as former Connections oblige me to, indeed Coms. are not worth accepting when a person can employ his spare time to so much greater Advantage as I can now. I must also request you to spare me all you can in the Introduction of French Officers to me, I do not speak their Language and being so exceedingly employed as I am the time they take from me in Visits & Applications can very ill be spared and is really very troublesome to me. Coud I speak the Language & had spare time it woud be a pleasure but it is now too much the reverse. I know very well you cannot avoid it sometimes and I shall always pay attention to them when you do recommend. Hitherto I have got all of them Appointments but really they are flocking over in such Numbers from every Port & by every Ship that I dont know what we shall do with them (all this in Confidence) and when you recommend any of them to the Secret Com- FEBRUARY 16, 1777  mittee of Correspondence dont put those letters under my Cover but given them directed to the Committee or else they fasten on me at once. In this way each member will have his Chance for the Trouble. I have rendered Mr Blaquire all the assistance he wanted and when the other Sloop arrives will procure her a Commission if requested, I shall now proceed to answer such parts of your several letters as require it.  Your letter of the 31st October covered Invoice & bill of Loading for an Adventure per the Sloop Molly, Capt. Conway, Consigned to Messrs. Jenifer & Hooe which we approved of in a former letter and have now the pleasure to enclose herein a Copy of the Account Sales and we place to your Credit 21354.4.3 this Cury for your half Net Proceeds, Messrs. Jenifer & Hooe have also requested us to Credit you for some other Sums which shall be mentd. by & by. I never saw Monsr. Nesmoi mentioned in your letter of 21 Octr. and you may suppose from what I have already said that I am not sorry to lose these Commissions.  By Mistake we charged Coms. on our joint Adv. by the Esperance, Capt. Prejent, which is rectifyed by Crediting you £20.0.6 this Cury. as your draft of the 3d Decr. in favor of Messrs. Jos. Russell & Sons was made for the purchase of a Brigt. & Cargo on our joint Account. I have Charged your account current here £391.10.0 this Cury. for one half the Amount and the other half is charged in our Martinico Account with you 8250 Livres half the Sum you recd for said draft. Your Bill of the 31 Octr to Aaron Lopez for 1680 Dollars is charged to your account current in £630 this Curry. being drawn on your own account, your draft of 6th Novr. in favor of Capt. Young being drawn on our joint Account I charge you in the Martinico Account Livres 43,570.17.6 being half of what you recd. for it and in your account current here £1987.6.5 this Cury. being half the Amot. of what it amounts to here Your Draft to Mrs. Abigail Cowell is placed to your account current as you desire £80.12.6 this Cury. You may depend that all your drafts on us shall be paid and I woud have you draw for our joint Account whenever you can Crediting half in Martinico & half in Philadelphia Account.  Your draft in favor of Vanbibber & Crocket is also placed to your own account as you desire in £255 this Cury. I have closed the Sales of Goods per the Independence, Capt Young, & Credit you £1477.11 this Cury. for your half Net Proceeds and shall try to settle the Sales of Goods by the Reprisal & Sachim if I can to send by this Conveyance. I will also send you a Sketch of the Martinique & Philada. account current as they now stand on our Books in order that you may compare them with yours & point out any Errors or Omissions. I am sorry you did not send forward the Bills for £1000 Stg. to Messrs. Geo. Clifford & Teysett of Amsterdam as I find they woud be very useful to me there and I hope you have been able to make out very well for Funds as I find your little Privateer has taken a   Guinea Man with 353 Slaves as I am informed here, however if you have made Use of the Bills you must charge them to the Committee here as you propose.  You will find the Adventure by the Sachem the most profitable by far and the Medicines sold very high indeed I think the Adventure to Charles Town will answer finely if it arrives safe there & back again of which there is a good Chance and you will do well to keep the Vessell continually running in that Service. I am sorry to inform you the Sloop Morris, Capt. Willson, is taken by the Men of War in Chesapeak Bay and of course the 141 bbls of Mr. Bealls Powder is lost, the Maryland Sloop with 121 1/2 bbls got safe, the Men of War going from hence to Chesapeak Bay will be the Means of losing us many Vessells as they will all think of pushing in there instead of this place in consequence of the Reports you had that this City was in the Hands of the Enemy &c. However the Virginians have sent out Boats to Cruize outside of the Enemy's Ships to give Notice to inward bound Vessells and some to the West Indies to let you know the Change of circumstances.  I have wrote to Mr J H Norton of Wmsburgh to ship you a quantity of Tobo. on account of the concerned in Mr Beall's Adventure sufficient to pay all the charges & expences on it and the same to Mr Stephenson in St. Eustatia we hope we may be more fortunate with the rest than with that by the Morris. The Invoice of Goods Consd. me by the Sachem are not yet sold they soon shall be and a Bill remitted for the Net Proceeds but the Exchange is enormously high.  If you Charter any French Vessels to come here, Molasses, Rum, Coffee, Sugar & all West India Produce are enormously dear. We have not recd. any letters for Capt. Cowell when any come they shall be forwarded immedy. shoud you send any Prizes here I shall do the needful & be glad to see them. I observe you have parted with 1/3d of the Edenton Brig to Mr Webb which is well and I will write to him at Edenton confirming him your plan except that instead of going with the Tobo. to Dantzig I shall recommend his stopping at Marstrandt, a Free Port in Sweden. He can there look about him and find out the best Market and instead of settling in Dantzig he had probably better fix in this place as more convenient. He can have access to all the best Markets in that part of the World either to buy or sell and in case of a French War may Charter Swedish Ships to carry Goods to St. Eustatia or Danish to St. Croix or as you say to St Lucia. The Coms. on the Brigts Voyage must be given to Messrs. Hewes & Smith for Mr Webb did not buy a Cargo for her altho he might sell what he brings for No. Carolina Currency which is in bad Credit among themselves.  I observe the Cornelia & Molly's flour woud be a dull Sale, this Article will be very scarce in America. Our last Crop of wheat was the worst ever  known and the Consumption of our Army with the destruction made by both Armies is immense, Common flour is 22/6, Supr fine 27/6. You will observe I was guided by Mr Prejent in sending the Esperance to Guadaloup & to Bassaterre, if he does but send that Ship back with a Cargo of Molasses and she gets in we shall do great things indeed. I thank you for the Intelligence respecting the Charming Peggy, Capt Cunningham, in which I am deeply Interested and had given it up for lost. If you do not send us the Molasses by the Cornelia & Molly you ruin us; 100 hhds of that Article at this time is worth £10,000; we look for that Brig & Mr. Meade's Ship every hour. That letter of Mr Braxton's is a very unfortunate one and I fear poor Merkle may suffer by it. I cannot think what the Devil carryed Meredith to Guadaloupe. If you can do us any service in that Affair I shall be very thankful for it and so will Mr Braxton whom Fortune has persecuted lately with unrelenting Cruelty. He has had a very noble House burnt by Accident with very valuable Furniture &c. I am very sensible how necessary it is you shoud be well supported with remittances and as desirous of sending as you are of receiving them, indeed I fear you may have been destressed but at the same time it has not been in our power to do what we wished, you must be sensible that with a River full of Ice, our Bay full of Men of War & Gen Howe at our Gates, woud not admit of the usual attention to business or the same facility in doing it, but I now hope to make you a little easier on this Subject after awhile at least perhaps Mr Prejent may have contributed to procure you Funds before this time.  I expect before this reaches you will have recd £1000 Stg. Value in Goods from Mr Schweighauser in Nantes probably some from Mr Delap in Bourdeaux, Mr Limozin of Havre de Grace & perhaps from Mr John Ross or Mr Deane, in short if you have, this Opportunity & the Independence will afford good Oppertunities to bring a part of them here others will also present and if we have but Luck on our side much Money will be made if any Medicines &c have arrived from Mr Cathalante hurry them here among the first for they will be much wanted by the Publick.  The Sloop Independence carries you a Quantity of Indigo & Flour and I shall try to send you a Quantity of Rice, Tobo. &c. but we send all our Tobo. Ships to Europe direct as it answers much better there and the Voyage not more hazardous than to Martinique. I have desired Mr Inglis to send a little Schooner from the Eastern Shoar with Tobacco & Corn to your Address and to write for such Goods as will answer best in that part of the world. I am a very long time without any letter from my Brother and very uneasy at it. He was in London the last Accounts I had of him and whether he has been laid hold of by the Ministers or infatuated with the pleasures of that City I don't know, but unless you hear  FEBRUARY 17, 1777  from him in a very satisfactory Style dont write him any more letters or Consign him any more Goods untill I am satisfyed of my present doubts. Mr John Ross of this place will be in France, he is known to Mr Schweighauser, Messrs. Delap &c. and is a punctual Intelligent careful Merchant and a Correspondence between you may be useful.

They are actuated by Resentment now, and Resentment coinciding with Principle is a very powerfull Motive.

  My dear Sir Baltimore Feb. 17. 1777  I have the melancholly Prospect before me, of a Congress continually changing, untill very few Faces remain that I saw in the first Congress. Not one from South Carolina-not one from North Carolina, only one from Virginia-only two from Maryland, not one from Pensylvania- Not one from New Jersey, not one from New York-only one from Connecticutt, not one from Rhode Island-not one from New Hampshire and only one at present from the Massachusetts.

FEBRUARY 17, 1777  I have the Pleasure however to see every day, that the Governments of the States are acquiring fresh Vigour, and that every Department is working itself clear of Toryism, Timidity, Duplicity and Moderation. New Jersey was never so well represented as it is now. Pensilvania, whose assembly will maintain its Ground have the last week appointed a New Delegation, every Man of whom is as firm as a Rock.

  My dear Sir, Baltimore in Maryld. 17th Feby. 1777 The papers that go with this to yourself and the other Commissioners, are so full on the subject of news that it is not very necessary for me to say much on that subject here. There scarcely comes a post but brings us an account of some skirmish in which the enemy get beaten, and driven back (without their forage) within their lines on the hills near Brunswick, where their distress we know is very great. This has been a most fatal winter Campaign to our enemies, and unless some change happens in their favor, which cannot be seen at present, it bids fair to be abundantly more so yet. Upon the whole, notwithstanding the contemptible Ministerial boasts in their Gazettes, and in Parliament, the great force they sent here has cut a most pitiful figure indeed. In humanity they figure still worse than They do in arms. Their ravages in the Jersies, until They were checked and driven back, beggars all description. Rapes, Murders, and devastation marked their steps in such a manner as would have disgraced the Savages of the Wilderness. The old English esteem for valor seems quite done away, and in several instances where young Americans displaid heroic spirit, and happened to fall in to their power, they have butchered them in cold blood in a most cruel and barbarous manner. They have been so frequently shameless in this way, after remonstrance has been in vain made to Gen. Howe, that the patience of our Soldiery is exhausted, and it appears as if no more prisoners will be taken, until Mr. Howe & his people learn the practice of humanity. I have received two letters from [ ....] (1) But he thinks strongly in favor of Great Britain. Was it not the most unrelenting and cruel persecution of us that forced us from her, and are we not compelled upon the clearest principles of self preservation to seek from Strangers what our kindred denied us? Must a great Continent be buried in ruin because the people of England cannot rouse from a lethargy which suffers the most abandoned of Men to trample upon the rights of human nature? It is decreed above, and we are parted Forever. Every Friendly American Nerve will now be strained to procure the active interference of France, by which, under God, the liberty of North America must be secured. Mr. Lee's stewart at Green Spring (Fauntleroy) has behaved so ill during our absence, that I have removed him, and got a Manager from Hanover (a John Ellis) who I believe will do well. I purchased a quantity of Oznaburgs from Philadelphia for the people this winter, and they make their own woolen & Cotton Stuffs. I hope the time will shortly come, when we may correspond more openly, fully, and freely; in the mean time, cannot you send me by return of Captain Johnson two pounds of the best Jesuits Bark prepared? You know how necessary that medicine is for me, and I know that it is not to be had here on any terms at present. Let Mr Lee know as much of this letter as imports him.

Farewell & send me a long letter by return of this vessel.  I am exceedingly uneasy about my poor Boys & beg of you to get them to me in the quickest and safest manner.  ""

  Baltimore in Maryland Feby. 17th. 1777 Honorable Gentlemen In Secret Committee of Congress  We have the honor to enclose you a Resolve of Congress that is of great Importance to the public Service,(1) which has suffered considerably the last Fall, and during this Winter, by the insufficient manner in which our Soldiers vuere clothed. Having found much Delay heretofore in getting Cloth made up, the Congress desire that 40,000 compleat Suits of Soldiers Cloaths may be sent. In giving directions for the making these Cloaths, it may be necessary, Gentlemen, to inform that both the Coats and Waistcoats must be short skirted, according to the dress of our Soldiery, and that they should be generally for Men of stouter make than those of France. Variety of Sizes will of course be ordered.  The Eastern Ports are generally entered with so much more Safety than the Southern, that we recommend the former for these Goods to be sent to, giving Orders to the Captain to inform Congress immediately of his Arrival, either by Express or by personal Attendance. We expect this Letter will be delivered you by Capt Johnston, Commander of the Lexington armed Vessel,(2) and as the Congress are very anxious to hear from you, it is probable Capt. Johnston will not remain long enough in France to get either Cloth or Cloaths in any quantity, but since it is necessary for the health of the Soldiers to cover them from the Dews of summer it will be of great Advantage to send a considerable quantity of Blankets and Tent Cloth by the Return of the Lexington, with Stockings, Flints, & Muskets with Bayonets. The Soldiers Cloaths and the Cloth should be so contrived as to reach North America by the month of September at furthest.  We are with esteem, honorable Gentlemen, your most obedient and very humble Servants. Richard Henry Lee  Fras Lewis Wm Whipple ""

  Dear Sir, Baltimore, 18th Feby. 1777. I have repeatedly wrote pressing letters, backed by resolves of Congress, for a full representation of our State, but have as yet not been honoured with an answer.(1) Permit me still to remind you, that in my opinion, our State may suffer for the want thereof; for instance the General has recommended to Congress the promotion of three major-generals from brigadiers, and ten brigadiers from colonels; and has given in a list of some persons as a hint to Congress. The mode and persons has occasioned many days' debate, and is this day to be brought on again, and notwithstanding many declarations to the contrary, Colonial prejudices sway the minds of individuals, that each State appear interested in the debates, for promotion in the line of their respective States.(2) From this, sir, you may judge how the State of New-York is circumstanced, having no vote in this and many other weighty points, and which I hope the Honourable Convention will speedily rectify.  I informed you in my former letters, that Capt. Rogers of the Montgomery private sloop of war, was in this port with two prizes, one of them with a quantity of woolens, linens, &c. which wait your directions for their disposal; as we are informed that three British ships of war with tenders, are cruizing in Chesapeake bay, to assist the tories on the eastern shore of said bay. Congress has thought fit to send down all the armed vessels (of which the Montgomery is one,) to suppress the insurgents, which they have effected, and I expect Capt. Rogers up in a few days,  FEBRUARY 18, 1777  when shall give him all the aid in my power to fit his vessel for another cruise.  I am also to inform you that Congress have appointed the 25th instant for the day on which they will adjourn to the city of Philadelphia, so that the Delegates you shall send to Congress may meet them there.(3)  I have the honour to be, sir, Your most humble servant,  Fra.

The letters you refer to I have not seen-viz those to the Secret and Marine Committees. I shall pay due attention to them when I know their contents. The letter you refer me to concerning the guns from Connecticut is not come to hand. I am therefore in the dark about that matter. This I know that Governor Trumbull was desired to  FEBRUARY 19, 1777  spare the guns he had provided for the ship built in Connecticut to the Raleigh, provided others could be procured in season for the Trumbull and as I have heard that Capt Manly has been in Connecticut after guns and have since heard he has guns for his ship, I suspect there has been some underhand dealing in this business and think the villainy should be brought to light, therefore hope you'll spare no pains to get to the bottom of it-in order thereto it will be necessary to know of Govr Trumbull at whose request they were spared to Manly.  Congress are about returning to Philadelphia. I believe they will adjourn thither next week. Till then I do not expect to have it in my power to send you the dimensions of the 74 gun ship, nor do I suppose it indispensably necessary at present, as the timber may be getting and other materials preparing while the workmen are employed on the other ship.(2) I am exceeding fearful of the vessels you are sending to this place and Virginia, as there are several ships now in Chesapeake Bay who have taken many vessels, but I have no order to direct them to be stopped but shall take the earliest opportunity to consult the Committees and write you fully on the subject.

  Gentlemen Baltimore Feby 19. 1777 The events of war have not since our last furnished any thing decisive. The enemy's army still remains encampt upon the Hills near Brunswick & our troops still continue to beat back their Convoys insomuch that we understand their horses die in numbers and we have reason to believe that the difficulity of removing their Stores, Cannon &c will be insuperably great until the opening of the Rariton furnishes a passage by water for their return to N. York. The American Army, is not numerous at present, but the new levies are collecting fast as possible, and we hope to have a sufficient force early in the field. We hear by a Speech of the King of Great Britain to his Parliament, that much money will be called for, no doubt to prosecute the war with unrelenting vigor. That we shall op- FEBRUARY 19, 1777  pose with all our power will be certain, but the event must be doubtful until France takes a decisive part in the war. When that happens our liberties will be secured, and the glory and Greatness of France be placed on the most solid ground. What may be the consequences of her delay must be a painful consideration of every friend of liberty and Mankind. Thus viewing our situation we are sure it will occasion your Strongest exertions to procure an event of such momentous concern to your country. It is in vain for us to have on hand a great abundance of Tobacco, Rice, Indigo, flour, and other valuable articles of Merchandize if prevented from exporting them by having the whole naval force of G.B. to contend against. It is not only for the interest of these States, but clearly for the benefit of Europe in general, that we should not be hindered from freely transporting our products that abound here and are much wanted there. Why should the avarice & ambition of G.B. be gratified to the great injury of other Nations?  Mr. Deane recommends sending Frigates to France to convoy our merchandize, but it should be considered that we have an extensive coast to defend, that we are young in the business of fitting ships of war, that founderies for cannon were to be erected, the difficulty of getting seamen quickly, when Privateers abound, as they do in the States, where Sailors are chiefly to be met with, lastly our frigates are much restrained by the heavy ships of the enemy, which are placed at the entrance of our Bays, in short, the attention of Great Britain must be drawn in part from hence, before France can benefit largely by our Commerce. We sensibly feel the disagreeable situation Mr. Deane must have been in from the receipt of the Committee's letter in June and the late date of his own letter in October, but this was occasioned by accident, not neglect, since letters were sent to him in all the intervening months, which have either fallen into the enemies hands, or have been destroyed.(1) From the time of Dr. Franklin's sailing, until we arrived at this place, the Ships of war at the mouth of Delaware, and the interruption given the post, added to the barreness of events prevented us from writing when we had no particular commands from Congress for you.  Mr. Bingham informs us from Martinique, that he learned from a Spanish General there on his way to South America, that the King of Spain was well disposed to do the United States Offices of friendship, and that a loan of money might be obtained from that Court. As the power sent you for borrowing is not confined to place, we mention this intelligence, that you may avail yourselves of his Catholic Majesty friendly Designs. Perhaps a loan may be obtained there on better terms than elsewhere. We expect it will not be long before Congress will appoint Commissioners to the Courts formerly mentioned and in the mean time you will serve the cause of your Country in the best manner with the Ministers from those   Courts to that of Versailles. Earnestly wishing for great news, and quickly from you, we remain with friendship, and esteem, Honble Gentlemen &c, B. Harrison R. H. Lee  P.S. Congress adjourns this week back to Philadelphia.  ""

  Dear Sir, Baltimore Feby. 19. 1977 I am extremely obliged to you for your last favour and much pleased with the spirit of your letter. I am as sure as of my existence that if our large Gallies were manned, gunned, and fitted, that the navigation of our Bay would receive no interruption.(1) I wish our Government would consult their Sister Maryland about this business, and with joint council and united strength, immediately equip such a number of strong Gallies as to free our Bay from these piratical incursions. Experience has proved the efficacy of these Vessels in small waters, and in the way of surprise against the largest Ships. They are cheaper than Ships, and rigged Ship fashion will be well understood by our Navigators. They are the best batteries, because they are movable ones, and the circumstance of drawing little water, peculiarly fits them for the shallow waters on our coasts. I pray you Sir to exert your influence to obtain the speedy use of the valuable Vessels, the surest defence, and the cheapest we can employ. The events of war are at a stand until our new Army can assemble. The enemies horses are nearly all dead for want of forage, and this is withheld from them by our feeble force, which is wisely and bravely employed to watch and defeat every foraging party that descends the hills of Brunswick. How unhappy it is and how disgraceful to America, that a Continent of Freemen should suffer 6000 men determined upon their ruin, to winter upon a hill in their Country! But yet it is so, and every exertion of Congress, the most urgent calls from them on every part, has been ineffectual to procure the destruction of these foes to human freedom ! For heavens sake Sir press forward our Quota, that we may early in the Spring, or before the Winter is over, do something effectual with these our determined enemies. That a war in Europe is not far off, is very clear to me. The Tyrants speech strongly suggests it amidst his fears of alarming his deluded people. We every day expect the Vessel that carried Dr. Franklin, to return, & by her we hope for the most agreable accounts. However, on these I would not place our reliance. FEBRUARY 19, 1777  We have means enough, if wisely improved, to secure us against every wicked attempt to destroy our liberties. Procul a Jove, procul a fulmene. Your Brother & Sister were inoculated three days ago, and must of course remain here until their recovery. Congress have determined to return Philadelphia next Wednesday. In the recess, I shall carry Mrs. Lee to Virginia that she may be indulged with the sight of her children whom she longs to see after 6 months absence. Farewell dear Sir,  Richard Henry Lee [P.S.] Remember me to all friends. Mr. Wythe is amongst my chosen few.  A number of Seamen lately put on shore from Com[modore] Hotham say that the Men of War are greatly afraid of our Gallies. Let us cultivate this passion by ordering our best appointed Gallies to lurk about them, & in calms or thick weather to annoy them with all imaginable spirit & address.  ""

You should have sent me half a dozen Authenticated Copies of the Resolve-it went by the Fly to the Randolph which will carry it to Martinico. A Copy Certified by myself goes by the Independence & you had best send me some more for other opportunitys.  In Consequence of the Resolves of Congress and an Order from the Marine Committee I have sent down the Schooner Musquito yesterday with two Months provisions to the Fly which was then lying at Rheedy Island and I sent down Orders to Capn Warner immediately to proceed to the Capes and give notice to the Light House to make the Signal for Capn Biddle whenever they saw a Ship in the offing.(1) I told him to keep Cruizing every day in the Offing and told him the Signal Biddle would make to be known by. Each Night I told him to run in under the Land to prevent the Enemys Ships from Cutting him off. By this means he will be sure to meet the Randolph as she will come in sight of the Light House on purpose to learn if there be any fresh Orders for him. Capn Warner will then deliver the Sundry orders and despatches I sent for Capn Biddle and they will part, the Fly to Cruize off the Capes of Virginia and the Randolph for Martinico & herein I enclose a Copy of the Orders I sent him and of the sundry letters relative to his Voyage, which I hope will meet approbation, and as they relate in some degree to the Marine Department I think you had best lay them before the Marine Committee or if you think necessary before Congress, because there are other Vessels will soon go for Martinico, and if any part of which I have written is disapproved counter orders will probably arrive in time.  I hope Biddle will send us a Galeatea, a Pearl, or a Camelias before he leaves this Coast.(2) Pray desire the Marine Committee if they are not coming up to Send me Orders respecting the Delaware. I have wrote General Washington to Send her Marines, and as it will be difficult manning her, I think she had best Sail soon as ever she has enough of men to work her, proceed to Windward of Barbadoes and Cruise untill she Manns herself from Prizes and then go to Martinico for supplies to return her with. The Washington May be Managed in the Same way, but there is no Guns for the Effingham therefore I think she had best load and send her to France to be compleated. And I dont know how it happens but there is no Guns made nor making for that ship.

  Feby 19.1777 Upon the question for referring the appointment of three major generals to the general officers of the army(1) it was said in the negative.  Dr Rush. \""I have heard the congress more than once called a republic. I love to realize the idea, and I hope it will inspire us with the virtuous principles of republican goverments. One of the most powerful & happy commonwealths in the world Rome called her general officers from the plough & paid no regard to rank, service or seniority. We have of late been successful it is true, but I despair of our country being saved 'till the instrumentality of military wisdom & virtue are employed for that purpose, and these can never be had 'till we use a sovereign power in calling them forth where ever we find them. It is no purpose to talk of the practice of despotic princes. They promote acording to seniority it is true, but they possess an absolute power of recalling, disgracing, or breaking their general officers as soon as they make them, and we find they are fond of exercising this power upon the least neglect, inattention or want of Success. The case is different with us. A general may lose a battle or a province, and we possess no power to recall or to displace him. If the motion is passed I shall move immediately afterwards that all the civil power of the continent may be transferred from our hands into the hands of the army, & that they may be proclaimed the highest power of the people.\""  (Mr. John Adams.)Dr Wetherspoon. \""Mr President, I am against the motion. It will produce faction, and disputes among your generals. I once left the honors of the college over which I preside to the choice of the senior class, But it produced so much confusion & ill blood, that I was obliged to resume that power again, and have since exercised to the satisfaction of my pupils as well as my own.\""  Col Richd Henry Lee. \""I wish the learned Doctor would distinguish between the practice of children & men. Our generals would certainly make a judicious choice, and would not be governed by the principles which actuate boys at School.\""  Mr. John Adams. \""Mr. President, I differ from the gentleman who spoke last. There are certain principles which follow us thro' life, and none more certainly than the love of the first place. We see it in the forms on which Children sit at Schools. It prevails equally to the last period of life. I am sorry to find it prevails so little in this Assembly. I have been distressed to see some members of this house disposed to idolise an image  FEBRUARY 19, 1777  Portrait of Benjamin Rush  which their own hands have molten.

This we shall find the next difficult thing to preventg. the depreciation of our money. I have no fears from the resignation of Officers if junior Officers are preferred to them. If they have virtue they will continue with us. If not, their resignation will not hurt us.\""  ""

  My Dear Bro. Baltimore l9th Feby 1777 My last was by Mr. Betten who set out the 10th inst since which nothing has happen'd this way worth mentioning. Several of the Enemies Ships are still in this Bay (Chesapeak) who do us great mischief, as but few vessels bound to this place or Virginia can escape them but as the Delaware is at present open many vessels get in there. By accots receiv'd from all Quarters a European war seems inevitable, but I hope the prospect of our being in some measure reliev'd by our Enimies having other objects to attend to will not in the least degree abate the ardour in the several states necessary for raising the new Army. We at this time Ought to have 50,000 men in the field, indeed half that number just now wod put our affairs in an exceeding good scituation, But I greatly fear the Enemy will get some capital advantages before we shall have a sufficient body of Troops to oppose them. I am extreamly anxious to hear how the recruiting service goes on to the Eastward, having heard nothing from thence, since your's of 8th Jany from Boston. One of the Frigates has sail'd from Philaa, another will sail very shortly from thence & one from this place if she is not Stopd by the Enemies ships in the Bay. Congress have come to a determination to return to Philaa next week so you may Expect my next will be from that place. Pray let me hear from you often & inform me how matters go on. Decisive measures ought to [be] taken with our internal Enemies; they do us much more mischief than People seem to be aware of. It is not possible that any man in America can be in a state of Nutrality at this time, I therefore hope effectual measures FEBRUARY 20, 1777  will be taken to prevent farther mischief by those Pests to society.

  Feb'y 20th [1777] A Committee on a letter from General How to General Washington reported,(1) that five Hessian Field Officers, & a Col. Campbell should be confined in order for retaliation, & that they should have copies of the resolutions & letters relative to this matter, in order to manifest the reluctance of Congress to this severity: which became necessary, being the only means whereby they could teach their enemies to regard the Law of Nations & the rights of humanity.(2) Some severe epithets were prefixed to enemies in the report, & they were objected to as unbecoming the dignity of Congress. A debate ensued in which some Gentlemen pointed out the impropriety of a bold, figurative style in public Instruments, & the beauty & propriety of simplicity. R.H. Lee, of Virginia (as usual) insisted strongly on retaining the epithets, because they expressed only what our enemies really are, & urged that the best writers always used such terms on the like occasions. The Delegate from North Carolina observed that simplicity of style was true beauty, & dignity, in the language of public bodies. Embellishments of splendid epithets & figures, if proper at all, FEBRUARY 20, 1777  were only for rhetoricians & such as write (3) for amusement, that he could wish our Energy might appear in our Actions, and that our Language might be simple and unadorned. He said he admired the Peasants of Switzerland who in their Struggles for Freedom were as Remarkable for Modesty in their Language, as for Vigor in their Exertions, that he wished the Congress would Imitate them in both. On the Question the Exceptionable passage was expunged. The Debate now turned on the Question whether the Law of Nations u-as proper to be mentioned. Some Gentlemen Argued that it was improper to apply it to the proceedings against General Lee because they proposed trying him by the Laws of his own Country, but others Insisted that they had no power to try him more than any other Prisoner by those Laws. Many Distinctions were attempted which I did not understand. At length the North Carolina Delegate declared he thought all Laws were (4) to be laid aside but what both Parties were subject to in Common, these were only the Laws of Nature and Nations. The Municipal Laws of all Countries at War were Silent with respect to the mere Transaction that relates to, or u ere the Consequence of War. That it was the proper Policy of Britain still to regard the Americans as Subjects and to Insist on the Execution of the Municipal Laws, but it was the proper policy of America to maintain that the American States stand in no other relat[ion to] Britain than as an Independant Empire at War with her, and therefore that the Law of Nations alone ought to be observed between them, that retalliation is the only Instrument whereby Nations can Compell the Observance of that Law, and America ought therefore firmly to retalliate when the Law of Nations was Violated. The Question was carried in favor of the Insertion of the Law of Nations.  ""

  Gentlemen, Baltimore Town Febry. 20th. 1777.  I am sorry to inform You that the Report of the Engagement on Fryday week is without any other Foundation than a little Skirmish, which the General barely mentions in his Letter to our Committee in Philadelphia.(1)  FEBRUARY 20, 1777  Congress are anxiously expecting a Reinforcement to our brave and worthy General from the new Levies. Above Six weeks ago Congress directed General Smallwood to take a Tour thro the State, and exert his Influence in Raising our Quota, and they called on all our public Bodies, and every Friend to America to yield him their assistance.(2) I mention this because Congress flattered themselves with great Success from this Measure, & it is said it has been neglected.  A little Attention to our public Affairs, and the State of our Army will convince any Man that the most vigorous Exertions are necessary and must be adopted to procure our Quota. I shall not enlarge on this important Subject. I beg Leave to call your immediate attention to it, and if a Moments delay can be granted, be pleased to consider the following Extract of a Letter from Genl. Washington to his Friend Colo. Harrison, of 12 Instant.(3) \""With great Truth I can add, that Heaven alone knows upon what principle they (the Enemy) act, or by what Means, they are kept quiet. That we are not able to make the least Stand, if they move, is as clear as the Sun in its' meridian Brightness. Whilst You are at an Expence equal to the Maintainance of a large Army, & expect that We are very strong, We have scarce Men enough to mount the Common Guards.\""  I thought this Intelligence necessary for your Information, but the Communication of it to our General Assembly must be made with every Caution of Secrecy.

  Sir, Philadelphia, 20th February, 1777 After I had finished the business with the Indians at Easton,(1) I went to visit our Army in New-Jersey, which I found small, but in good spirits; and, from its advantageous situation, I have the best hopes that the enemy will be confined to their present circle during the remainder of the winter. But I observed one thing while I was at the different posts in the army, which calls for the immediate attention of Congress. It is the want of money. \""Why does not Congress supply the army with money?\"" is the general cry. I will venture to assert that, unless this matter is attended to and remedied, without loss of time, the most important ill-consequences will be the issue. Nothing less, I will even venture to predict, than a dissolution of the army.  I am not unapprised of the real cause of the present low state of the Treasury. The experiment of borrowing money at four per cent has been  FEBRUARY 20, 1777  fairly tried; and the event evidently proves that money can not be got without a higher Interest. In my opinion then, the Interest must be either raised, or the principal surrendered into the hands of our Enemies. For, most assuredly, the whole great cause of this Continent, which we have been so long supporting thro' a multitude of difficulties, depends upon our exertions at this crisis. If it should ever be decided against us, it will be within a few months; and it infallibly will, unless the Commander in chief is supplied with cash.

  My dear Sir [February 20, 1777](1) Yesterday Congress proceeded to the Promotion of General Officers. There was much Difficulty and Delicacy in settling the Principles, on which the Promotions ought to be founded. I expresed my Sentiments in Favour of adhering to the Line of Seni[ority adopt]ed, by Observations which I will not repeat [at present?] to you, that, if it was proper to deviate [from that line], you were the officer, in whose Favour the alteration ought to be made. Lord Stirling, General Mifflin, yourself, General Stevens and General Lincoln were chosen Major Generals. I need not express my Satisfaction at your Promotion. I feel peculiarly pleased that I have seen the Event take Place before I leave Congress.  I am exceedingly hurt that our deserving Friend General Thompson was passed over: It is Misfortune sufficient to be a Prisoner. I am, however, willing to believe that the only Reason, with many Gentlemen, for omitting him was an Apprehension that a Promotion would increase the Difficulty of his Exchange.  If you have not already engaged yourself, you will much oblige me by appointing Billy Bird your Aid de Camp. You will recollect that, when he first entered into the Service, I was solicitous he should be formed under you. You know [however, of his] Activity: He is young: But he is far from [being perfect] in Sense and Judgment. If he is not [yet exch]anged; I hope his Exchange will soon take [place.

  Feby 21 1777 A letter from General Lee requesting a Committe of Congress to be sent to New York to whom he might, with Permission of Lord and General How, impart Something of great Consequence to himself and of no less, in his Opinion to the public.(1) His letter was in very pressing Terms. It was the General sense of Congress that no Conference ought to be held with any but Embassadors properly authorised by the Court of Britain to treat of Peace. That Lord and General How could have no Powers on such a Subject by virtue of their Commissions which was particularly Limitted by Parliament to other Purposes. That any Conference with them would be Impolitic and degrading-degrading because beneath the Dignity of Congress to Treat with persons whose very Powers supposed them objects of their Dominion, and even of their Mercy-Impolitic because it would give an Opportunity of circulating Stories in the Courts of Europe that the Congress were on Treaty of Reconciliation with Britain and by this means suspend for sometime their Intention of befreinding us. But it was also agreed that the Congress ought to give every possible attention to General Lee's personal Safety. The Difficulty was in the mode, some being of opinion it ought to be by permitting any person he pleased to go and Confer with him on any matter relative to his private Business others that it ought to be by ordering the General to send an Officer for that purpose.(2) At length the Congress came to a resolution to Direct3 General Washington to Inform General Lee of the measures they were taking for his safety, and to request him to inform them of any thing which they could farther do, but that they could not think it Consistent with the Dignity of Congress to send a Committee to Treat with him on any public Business.

  [February 21, 1777 ] (1) Congress received a letter Feby 20th 1777 from Genl Lee (2) a prisoner in New York (written by permission of Lord & general Howe) requesting a conference with two or three members of congress upon matters of the last importance to himself, & in his opinion to America, upon which it was said by  Dr. Rush. Mr President, In considering of the propriety of this request it becomes us I to attend to the present situation of the court of FEBRUARY 21, 1777  Britain, 2ly to the conduct & charecters of Lord & general Howe, and 3 to the conduct, & charecter of general Lee. 1 The court of Britain is alarmed with the fear of a French war. They wish to terminate the present war in America by a negociation as well as by the sword. They have no terms to offer us. They mean only to deceive & divide us. 2 Lord & genl Howe were chosen as fit instruments for seducing & deceiving the colonies. They have practised many Arts for that purpose. Witness the conference they extorted from the congress thro' Genl Sullivan last summer. They have been told by the reinforcement of tories that lately joined them its effect upon the people of America, & they expect thro' a better instrument (Genl Lee) to produce greater & worse effects by a conference with the members of congress set on foot at their request by the general. 3 General Lee with all his great qualities possesses the weakness of being easily imposed upon. His charecters of men are dictated by caprice or passion. I have seldom known him give a true charecter of any man. He is fond of negociations & conferences He tried to bring about an interview with Genl Burgoyne at Cambridge for that purpose. He urged a second interview with Lord Howe last summer. I believe Gen Lee to be honest & sincerely attached to our cause, but some people suppose he threw himself in the way of being taken prisoner. Considering all these things I maintain that a compliance with the general['s] request would be impolitic, & highly dangerous to the union & safety of the united States.  Mr. Jno Adams. Mr President, I am against the proposed conference. It will do mischief. The last conference with Lord Howe did no good. The Whigs were alarmed with it, and the tories complained that the reason why it did not end in a negociation was because improper men were sent, and because the congress did not relax eno' from its dignity. I admire Genl Lee for his military talents, but he possesses an unbounded Share of Vanity. This Vanity led him to correspond with Genl Burgoyne-and induced him to propose himself as one of a committee to confer with Lord Howe. His Lordship has no terms to offer us. The kings Speech is decisive against us. It lets loose all the dogs of war & corruption upon us, But it carries a remedy to its terrors along with it- it holds out the probability of a war wth. France.  Mr Chase. I am against the conference, but I move for the publication of Genl Lee's letter to the congress in order to satisfy our constituents who have heard that it contains propositions of peace.  Mr. Middleton. I am against the conference for the reasons that have been given. Lord Howe has made use of Genl. Lee as a decoy duck to take in the colonies. I am against the publication of the General['s] letter to the congress, Unless you publish with it his letter to Genl Washington in which he requests the company of his Aid de camp and his dogs.  Col Harrison. I suspect Lord & General Howe have offered Genl Lee his life on condition of his bringing About this conference which is de- FEBRUARY 22, 1777  signed to betray us into a negociaton. It will suspend our military Operations, and injure us in the court of France where our Commissioners are now soliciting an Alliance for us. The last conference with Lord Howe had this effect. Let us suppose that he means only to confer with us about his private affairs, and let us pass a resolution declaring our determination to support him & our willingness to hear & transact any thing that related to his safety or interest.  This resolution was unanimously agreed to.  ""

  Dear Sir Baltimore Feb. 22. 1777 I had this Evening the Pleasure of your Favour of the fourteenth instant, and a great Pleasure it was, as it was an Evidence that my old Friends were beginning to recollect me.(1) I have been So long absent that I Seemed to have lost all my Correspondents in the Army.  It would be, at all Times an obligation upon me, to hear of the Motions of the Armies, and of our prosperous or adverse Situations, of our good or ill Success.  The Account you give of the good Behaviour of our Countrymen is very pleasing to me, but it is equally So to hear of the good Behaviour of the Troops of any other State in the Union. It is good Behaviour that I wish to hear of, and it is quite immaterial to me where the officer or Man was born or where he lives, provided he behaves ill. The sordid Prejudices, which are carefully fomented, and the malicious slanders, which are industriously propagated, I both despise and detest, if Contempt and Hatred can exist together.  In Truth, my old Friend, I wish to hear, more than I do, of the Vigilance, Activity, Enterprise, and Valour of Some of our New England Generals, as well as others. What is the Army at Providence about? What FEBRUARY 22, 1777  is become of the Army at Peeks Kill, or on the white Plains? What Numbers have they? Are We to go on forever in this Way? maintaining vast Armies in Idleness? and loosing the fairest opportunity that ever offered, of destroying an Enemy compleatly in our Power? We have no Returns of any Army. We know not what Force is on Foot any where. Yet We have Reason to believe that our Constituents are paying for a very great Force.  Posterity will never blame the Men. They will lay all their Censures upon the General officers. All History has done so, and future Historians will do the same. The general officers, if they understand themselves, and have a Suitable Code of military Laws, will make a good Army, if you give them human Nature only, to work upon. It behoves you all then to look out. I dont mean this as a Censure, but as a Stimulus. I hope to hear from you, often, and wishing you as many Laurells as you please, I remain, Your Friend.  ""

  Sir, Philada Feby 22d. 1777 We are much Concerned at the necessity of writing you in a Stile so different to what we have lately used respecting the removal of Congress  FEBRUARY 22, 1777  to this City, but an Express arrived late last Night from Genl. Washington with advice to Genl. Gates that the Enemy have received very considerable reinforcements in New-Jersey & that Genl. Howe & Lord Percy arrived at Brunswick last Thursday with a Number of Troops & some heavy artillery.(1) This latter circumstance indicates offensive War & it is possible they may have it in View to move this way altho' we cannot Conceive how they are to bring those Canon or sufficient Provisions, Forage & Stores for such an Expedition unless they depend on driving Genl Washington from his Posts & supplying themselves in the unravaged parts of New Jersey. It has often been reported & some of the Tories have said with Confidence that a Number of Gondolo's have been built or are building at New York. If this be true it is possible they may mediate an attack by Water & think of overpowering the Gondolo's of this State so as to get the Command of the Chevaux de Frize & then transport their army across Delaware. This is meer suggestion founded on the Impossibility of their Crossing the River without such aid. We shall therefore give the Council of Safety Notice to be prepared & such Continental Vessells as are here shall be on the Watch ready to give their assistance. Upon the whole we don't think the Enemy can move this way suddenly & rather imagine their first view must be to drive Genl. Washington from his Posts, Seize Horses & Forage, which being effected they may turn their longing Eyes this way. Therefore as the fate of War is uncertain We dispatch this in haste hoping it may be with you before Congress is adjourned & we think under present appearances they had better remain untill the real design of Mr Howe is made evident. This Moment we have recd the enclosed from Genl Washington & send it forward immediately that you may see his opinion of things.(2) We shall now give orders for having the Public Stores in readiness to be removed, but cautiously avoid giving any great alarm. We are more uneasy at the scene of innoculation lately introduced amongst our New Troops than at any other thing as it makes us weak & will keep us so for some time. With the utmost respect & Esteem We remain, sir, Your Obedt hble servts,  Robt Morris  Geo Clymer ""

Feby 22d. 1777 We have dispatched an express to Congress this morning with your letter of the 20th which will be with them in time to prevent their adjournment next Tuesday from Baltimore. We have had a Conference with the Council of Safety and after Communicating to them the intelligence Contained in your Excellencys letters to Genl Gates and that to Congress We requested them to give immediate orders for putting all their Force by Water into the best posture they possibly can, we also advised their Collecting such of the Militia as have not been in actual service into such readiness, as to be subject to immediate orders, this can be done without giving any alarm, or at least any general alarm. Genl Gates will station proper officers at New Town and give orders respecting the Boats on the Jersey side of Delaware, the present Cold Weather has made so much Ice in the River & Creeks that they cannot be brought over, therefore if any sudden movements of the Enemy make it necessary, they must all be destroyed. We read with much concern one paragraph in your Excellencys letters to Genl.

We have complyed with  FEBRUARY 22, 1777  your wishes in every instance & done all that our situation wou'd enable to promote the public Service in every line that came under our Notice. 'Tis true that our judgment was against removing the public Stores from this City since your success at Trenton & Prince Town for various reasons that are not necessary to enumerate at this time, but not depending on our own judgement or inclination, We stated to Congress your recommendations on that Subject & our opinion with some reasons in support of it & they were pleased to order them to remain untill other events shou'd happen that might make a removal necessary & now Sir that You again recommend this business, We will give immediate orders to every department to hold the Stores in readiness to be carried away at an hours warning. Thus much we thought necessary to say in our own defence, assuring your Excellency at the same time that no board ever did or will pay more attention to your recommendations than this Committee.

  Dear Sir Baltimore Feby. 22. 1777 The question for raising the interest of our loan office tickets to 6 per cent. was attempted again the day before yesterday in Congress but was lost as formerly by a division of the States. Every post and express that arrives brings us complaints of the want of money, and asurances of the impossibility of getting it as the low interest of 4 per cent. These complaints are echoed daily from every corner of the room but to no purpose. The States that oppose the raising of the interest are Rhode Island, Connecticut, North and South Carolinas, and Georgia. Maryland is divided. It is worthy of notice here that only seven members of the congress who represent five of the above States decided the above question, contrary to the inclinations of not less than 17 members who represented the States that voted for raising the interest, and who represent at least 2/3rds of the people of America. This unjust mode of representation I hope will be altered in the confederation. If it is not it will end sooner or later in the ruin of the Continent. We shall attempt the important question once more before we adjourn to Philada. If we fail we are undone. Another emission of money will in my opinion be a public fraud which no State-necessity can justify. The loss of two or three provinces would not hurt our cause half so much as the news of our bankruptcy.  The Congress have concluded unanimously not to send a deputation of their body to General Lee.(1) The present distracted situation of the Court of Britain, the characters and conduct of Lord and General Howe, and the disposition which Genl. Lee always shewed for negociations, and conferences with the General Officers belonging to the british Army induced the Congress readily to adopt a suspicion that the royal Commissioners had suggested the maneuvre in order to suspend our military operations, and to divide and deceive the States. This suspicion was rendered the more probable from the circumstances of this, being about the time in which our Commissioners at the Court of France will urge the necessity of a speedy declaration in our favor, and which can only be prevented by the news that we are negociating with Great Britain. It is well known the conference with Lord Howe last summer had well nigh ruined our interest at the Court of France. The Congress have passed a resolution that will we hope satisfy the General that while we are jealous of our honor, we are determined to neglect nothing that concerns his safety, or private affairs.  We have yesterday appointed Colonels Poor, Glover, Patterson, Varnum, Wayne, Dehaes, Muhlenberg, Weedon, Jno. Cadwallider and Woodford Brigadiers General. Lord Sterling, with Messrs Mifflin, Sinclair, Steven and Lincoln are Majors General.  FEBRUARY 22, 1777  I am Dr Sir with great respect, Your most obedt Servant, B. Rush ""

  My Dear Sir, Baltimore 22d Feby 1777 I have receiv'd your favor of the 15 Ult. The intolerable delays & uncertainty of the Post has prevented my writing so often as I should otherwise have done, but I hope an effectual remidy will spedily be apply'd to this evil when our correspondence will meet with less interruption. I am sorry your Health will not admit of your returning to Congress. My Colleage (1) seems determin'd on taking his departure in May, at which time I am very desirous of returning also. In short no pecuniary advantage wod induce me to tarry even to the end of that month. I therefore hope to have leave to go home the beginning of May. After repeated requisitions of Genl. Washington, Congress have made a number of Genl. Officers. The Gens Proposal is that there shod be a FEBRUARY 22, 1777  Major Genl. to every three Brigades and a Brigadier every three Regiments. He also propos'd three Leiut Genls but this I believe will not be speedily complyed with as its the general opinion in Congress that the Senior Major Genl. may answer the purpose for the present. Five are added to the list of Major Genls. and ten to the list of Brigadier. Among the latter is Col. Poor who was strongly recommended by Genl. Gates as well as by the Commander in Chief.(2) This will make a vacancy in your late arangement which I hope will be well fill'd. I only wish that real merit may influence the choice. I am fearful that sending men off in small Parties will be injurious to the recruiting service, as sending part of a company will backward the inlistments to compleat it. I hope proper care will be taken to send good Surgeons as much depends on them. Morgan & Stringer are both displac'd, & the Medical Department will be put on a very different footing from what it was last Campaign.(3) You are sensible of the necessity of a reformation particularly in that department & I hope great care will be taken in the appointment of Regimental Surgeons. I also hope proper measure will be persu'd by each state to furnish their respective Soldiers with cloathing for notwithstanding every method that can be taken by Congress, there will be but a scanty supply unless the different states pay particular attention to their own men.  Inclos'd is a copy of a letter from Genl. Lee which gave me no small uneasiness when I first heard of it least some might think it expedient to comply with the request, but to my great joy when it came before Congress there did not appear one advocate for the measure, it evidently appearing to be a scheme of those incendiaries (the two Howe's) to amuse & slaken our measures, but they are disapointed! Lee at the same time wrote to Genl. Washington desiring him to send one of his aids de camps to him & his dogs which I suppose the Genl has comply'd with. Soon after Lee was taken Genl W was directed to offer six Field officers for him, that being the price of a Major Genl. and at the same time to assure Howe that the treatment that Lee receiv'd shod be exactly retaliated on them, which promise I hope will be religiously adher'd to! (4)  Nothing material has lately happen'd in the army. We hear frequently of small Skirmishes in which we always have the advantage. The Enemy are closly confin'd to Brunswick & are put to great difficulties for forage &c but our army is not strong enough to attack them. The Southern troops are daily joining the Army, & all that have not had the small Pox are inoculated in their way. I cod wish that measure were adopted with the Eastern troops. I think it might be done without loosing much time. We are still anxiously expecting Intelligence from Europe. The Randolph is at last gone to sea & the Delaware I expect will soon follow her. The Virginia is nearly ready also but I have nothing of the Frigates at the Northward. Congress have determin'd to adjourn to Philaa next Tuesday so you may expect my next will be from that place. In the meantime be  FEBRUARY 23, 1777  assured that I am with great Respect Your very affece Friend & Hume Sert, Wm. Whipple  ""

  1777. Feb. 23.  Took a Walk with Mr. Gerry, down to a Place called Ferry Branch, a Point of Land which is formed by a Branch of the Patapsco on one Side and the Basin before the Town of Baltimore on the other. At the Point is a Ferry, over to the Road which goes to Anapolis. This is a very pretty Walk. At the Point you have a full view of the elegant, splendid Seat of Mr. Carroll Barrister. It is a large and elegant House. It stands fronting looking down the River, into the Harbour. It is one Mile from the Water. There is a most beautifull Walk from the House down to the Water. There is a descent, not far from the House. You have a fine Garden-then you descend a few Steps and have another fine Garden-you go down a few more and have another. It is now the dead of Winter, no Verdure, or Bloom to be seen, but in the Spring, Summer, and fall this Scaene must be very pretty.  Returned and dined with Mr. William Smith a new Member of Congress. Dr. Lyon, Mr. Merriman, Mr. Gerry, a son of Mr. Smith, and two other Gentlemen made the Company. The Conversation turned, among other Things, upon removing the Obstructions and opening the Navigation of Susquehannah River. The Company thought it might easily be done, and would open an amazing Scaene of Business. Philadelphia will oppose it, but it will be the Interest of a Majority of Pensilvania to effect it.  This Mr. Smith is a grave, solid Gentleman, a Presbyterian by Profession-a very different Man from the most of those We have heretofore had from Maryland.  The Manners of Maryland are somewhat peculiar. They have but few Merchants. They are chiefly Planters and Farmers. The Planters are those who raise Tobacco and the Farmers such as raise Wheat &c. The Lands are cultivated, and all Sorts of Trades are exercised by Negroes, or by transported Convicts, which has occasioned the Planters and Farmers  FEBRUARY 23, 1777  to assume the Title of Gentlemen, and they hold their Negroes and Convicts, that is all labouring People and Tradesmen, in such Contempt, that they think themselves a distinct order of Beings. Hence they never will suffer their Sons to labour or learn any Trade, but they bring them up in Idleness or what is worse in Horse Racing, Cock fighting, and Card Playing.  ""

  Feby 24th [1777] A Letter from General Washington was read Informing Congress that General How and Lord Piercy had come over from New York to Brunswick with a reinforcement of Troops and heavy Artillery, that he apprehended the Enemy Intended to enlarge their Quarters and procure Forrage in Jersey or to march towards Philadelphia, that he was not in a Condition to prevent either.(1) The Congress went into a Committee of the whole hereupon-and General Washington was ordered to call to his aid all the Continental Troops under General Heath on the North side of the River, and all that were in Providence, to write letters to all the Collonels in the States North of Maryland ordering them to send the recruits to Join him as fast as they were raised, except such regiments as were destined for the Northern Department.(2) The Board of War was ordered to write similar letters to all the other States North of North Carolina, and the State of New York was requested to supply the place of General Heath with Militia.(3) New Jersey and Pensylvania were also requested to reinforce General Washington with Militia from each.(4)  To this report of the Committee of the whole was subjoined a Declaration of Congress that it was their Intention to reinforce the General so as to enable him not only to Curb and Confine the Enemy within their present Quarters but with the Blessing of God Entirely to subdue them before they are reinforced. This pompous Paragraph was very much Condemned by some Gentlemen as an unworthy Gasconade-and it was warmly debated. North Carolina observed that Threats were unbecoming a Private Gentleman, and much more unbecoming a Political (5) Body, That this pompous boast if not realized would render the Congress exceedingly ridiculous, and there was great reason to fear it would not. That our vigor ought to appear by Efforts, not Words, that at best it was a useless superfluity and ought to be expunged. The Question was put and Jersey, Pensylvania, North Carolina and South Carolina voted for expunging, the rest for retaining.(6) N.B. Maryland was not represented.(7)  FEBRUARY 24, 1777  There appeared upon this whole debate a great desire in the Delegates (8) of the Eastern States, and in one of New Jersey to Insult the General.

I shall very soon become as clamorous an Advocate for order, Subordination, Government, and Discipline, as ever Philanthrop was,(2) indeed I am already.  I am extreamly mortified that those worthy Men, who Staid for Six weeks, from the 1 of Jany, were obliged to go home unpaid. If I could explain to those honest Men the true Causes of this, they would acquiesce but I cannot. But they will be paid.  Am glad to hear that the Army in Brunswick, are in a good Way. I hope We shall demolish them. We must. We will. Twenty thousand Men are not necessary for this. But I hope never the less, you will have that number and more by the Time you mention.  I wish I could learn what Forces you have, at Morris Town, Chatham, Elisabeth Town, Princeton &c &c &c.  What has Heath done? How many Men has he?  What has Spencer done?  I hope there will be Enquiries, sometime or other, into the Conduct of our Armies from Long Island to this Moment.

  Feb'y. 25th. [1777] This day there was a very interesting debate on some amendments proposed to a report of a Committee, appointed to consider of some means for preventing desertion; but the main question was concerning the jurisdiction of Congress & the States. The decision was postponed. The debate lay chiefly between Mr. Wilson, of Pennsylvania, and the Delegate from North Carolina. The opinion of a great majority was with the latter; but it was not deemed prudent to decide.(1) N.B. This is all that I can now transmit: but as you know the opinion of your Delegate on such questions, you can judge the opinion of Congress: & for this reason it is that I mention that a majority was in his fayour.

  Feby 25th 1777 The Question of Interest was again debated and postponed.(1) A Report was taken up relative to Deserters. It stood Originally a recommendation  FEBRUARY 25, 1777  of Congress to the several states to Enact Laws Empowering all Constables, Ferry keepers and Freeholders to take up persons suspected of being Deserters and Carry them before any Justice of the Peace. An Amendment was moved the purport of which was that the Power should go Immediately from Congress without the Intervention of the States. Many Gentlemen were inattentive and it passed. The Delegate from North Carolina desired to be informed if he might enter his Protest against it. He was informed by the Chair that he could not, he then desired to have his dissent entered on the Journal declaring he was not Apprehensive of any Injury from it in the State he represented because he knew it would never be there observed, the People too well knowing the Maxims of their Government, but that as it was as much as his Life was worth to Consent to the Congress exercising such a Power, he desired that he might be able to prove from the Journals that he did not. He said it appeared to him that Congress was herein assuming a Power to give authority from themselves to persons within the States to seize and Imprison the persons of the Citizens, and thereby to endanger the personal Liberty of every man in America. A motion was now made for reconsidering. On the reconsideration the Debate lay chiefly between Mr Wilson of Pensylvania, and the North Carolina Delegate. Mr. Wilson argued that every object of Continental Concern was the subject of Continental Councils. That all Provisions made by the Continental Councils must be carried into execution by Continental authority. That the Army was certainly a Continental object, and preventing Desertion in it was certainly as necessary an object as the raising of it. That nothing could be more necessary to prevent Desertion than to take Effectual Measures for apprehending deserters, that this Power must necessarily be in the Congress, and that they certainly had Power to authorise any persons in the States to put them in Execution. That the Power of taking up deserters was in every Soldier and officer of the army, and that the Congress might make any Justice of Peace in any state such an officer and thereby give him that Power, and if by making him an officer they Could give him that Power, they surely could without. That the officers and soldiers of the army were certainly not subject to Laws of the states. That this was no more than what was every day done in appointing Commissioners to purchase provisions and other things under the resolves of Congress. That the Congress had always directed their resolves to be put in Execution by Committees of Inspection and it was never denied that they had Power.  The Delegate of North Carolina answered that he admitted Continental objects were subjects of Continental Councils-but denied that the provisions made by Continental Councils were to be enforced by Continental authority. That it would be giving Congress a Power to prostrate all the Laws and Constitutions of the states because they might create a Power within each that mush act entirely Independent of them, and might act directly Contrary to them. That they might by virtue of this  Power render Ineffectual all the Bariers Provided in the states for the Security of the Rights of the Citizens for if they gave a Power to act Coercively it must be against the Subject of some State, and the subject of every state was entitled to the Protection of that particular state, and subject to the Laws of that alone, because to them alone did he give his Consent That he hoped the Gentleman would not Insist on this Principle which in its nature was so very Extensive and alarming That the states alone had Power to act Coercively against their Citizens, and therefore were the only Power Competent to carry into execution any Provisions whether Continental or Municipal That he was well satisfied no Power on Earth would ever obtain Authority to act Coercively against any of the Citizens of the state he represented except under their own Legislature; unless it was obtained by Violence That his fellow Citizens were struggling against unlawful exertions of Power, and they would submit to them from no Authority That he admitted the army to be a proper object to be governed and directed by Continental Councils, and that it is proper the Congress should provide for punishing Desertion, and that Desertion was a very [great] evil, but that who is a deserter or who is not is a Question that must be determined previous to any Punishment, and who ever can determine it has a Power over the Life and Liberty of the Citizens for as much as any man may be accused of Desertion but every one accused may not be Guilty That if the Congress has the Power to appoint any Person to decide this Question the Congress has power unlimited over the Lives and Liberties of all men in America and the Provisions so anxiously made by the respective States to Secure them, at Once Vanish before this Tremendous Authority However proper it might be for Congress to punish Desertion it was Necessary for the states to prevent arbitrary and unjust punishments and Imprisonments of their Citizens, and unless some mode were provided for trying the above Question every man was liable to be imprisoned at the Discretion of Officers and servants of the Congress No power could be Competent to this but such as is created by the Legislature of each state, and if any Question related to the internal Polity of a state it certainly was this which Involved all the Rights of the Citizens personal Freedom He would not speak for other states, but for his own he would declare that the Constitution had anxiously provided that no man should be Imprisoned or in any Degree Injured in his Person or Property but under the authority of the Laws of the state It was a fundamental Maxim well understood there that no Magisterial Authority could be given but by the Legislature, and none could be exercised beyond what was expressly laid down in the Laws The Congress certainly could not give a Power within any State to hear and Determine offences or to seize and Imprison the Persons of the Citizens. Yet most assuredly the Power Contended for was no less, unless every Deserter was branded in the Face so that it could be determined without [doubt] who was Deserter and who was not. He was sorry to   hear the Gentleman Say that the Officers and Soldiers of the Army were not Subject to the Laws of the States, and hoped the Gentleman would retract it, for assuredly the army must always be in some State and might be in every State, and if they were not Subject to the Laws of the respective States, it would follow that a powerful Body of men within any State might violate with Impunity all the Rights of the Citizens and Subject them to the worst of Oppressions This being Contrary to all the purposes for which men enter into Society, the admission of it must dissolve all Society and Government, and being peculiarly detested by the Americans who were struggling at the risque of Life and property against Oppression, it never could take place among them, until they lost al[l] Common Sense, and all Love of Freedom That the Power of taking up deserters if it was in every officer and soldier it did not follow that every officer and soldier might call whom he pleased a deserter and Imprison and punish him as such, that there must be a Power to determine whether deserters or not, and the Congress could give no such Power without giving authority to some Individuals within the states to exercise Magisterial Discretion and subject the Citizens to that discretion He could not conceive a State Independant if any Power could do this except their Internal Legislature who had their authority for that purpose from the People He would declare firmly it could not be done in North Carolina by any other, if their Bill of Rights and Constitution were of any Effect, and not meer waste paper, for they provided that no freeman within the state should be in any way or Degree restrained of his Liberty or damaged in his Property except under the Laws of the state to which his Consent must be given, because every freeman had a Voice [in his?] I,egislature  That in North Carolina no Military Officer could act in any civil department whatever, and he believed they could not in any state where Government was Established, yet if it were otherwise his civil authority must be derived from the state and not the Congress, and the rules and Limits whereby it was to be exercised must be expressly laid down by the state and could not be altered or extended by the Congress unless they had a Power over the Internal Laws of the states which Power never would be given, and no one pretended to That the Difference was manifest between giving Commissions to purchase within the states, and giving Magisterial authority That One was only empowering some Individuals to exchange Money for Commodities in fair Contract which each party must previously agree to, here was not the shadow of restraint, but was founded on the most liberal Idea of Consent No Contract being valid unless all the Transactions are bonafide Consented to by all the Contracters, and it was every day done by Individuals of the states the most remote, and unconnected with each other, that the other was enabling Individuals to hear and determine accusations against other Individuals, to pass Judgment, and to Subject them to punishment, which surely was the  highest act of Dominion, and could be Justified only by the Laws of the State which had the Consent and authority of the People (here he Illustr[at]ed by quoting the case of the Negro Somerset) . That it was true the Congress directed their resolves to the Committees of Inspection to be put in Execution, but surely it must be remembered that the Congress recommended to the states to appoint such for that purpose and the states did appoint them accordingly. Their authority was certainly derived from that appointment, and not from the Congress in North Carolina, the matter was beyond dispute for the resolves which Constituted Committees expressly empowered them to execute the resolves of the Continental Congress.  Mr. Wilson in reply admitted that he laid down the Principle too largely, and that when he said the officers and soldiers were not subject to the Laws of the States he meant only that in their Military duty they were subject only to the Congress. He did not directly answer the arguments from North Carolina but argued ab inconveniente that the Power was Necessary. He said if the States alone were competent to this Power it would follow that no deserter could be punished or apprehended but in the State where he inlisted, and Consequently by keeping out of that State he was sure of Impurity. That this was in Effect declaring that desertion could not be punished and consequently that the army might be immediately disbanded. That he did not Contend for giving the Power to Justices of the Peace &c. as such but as Individuals proper to execute the resolution. He moved to amend by taking out the words suspected of being, which would leave it deserters which he hoped would remove all objections.  Mr R.H. Lee (2) from Virginia said it was a Misfortune to be too learned, that he could see no more in it than he saw every day in the Newspaper which was advertising and offering a Reward for Deserters and this was certainly exercising no Magisterial Power.  Mr J Adams from Massachusetts confessed the motion passed him without his attention, that he was inclined to think from what passed that the articles of War must be enacted into Laws in the several States, and he believed the officers thought so or they would proceed with greater vigor.  The Delegate from North Carolina rejoined to all three. To Mr Wilson. That Necessity was never to be admitted as an argument for assuming a Dangerous and improper Power tho it might be admitted as an Excuse for some particular unlawful exercise of authority and then the Necessity might appear striking and Inevitable to the Power which Judges and Excuses the act. That otherwise the Plea of Necessity would Subvert all restraints laid on persons instrusted with [power and] authority, and always had been used by Tyrants for [that] Purpose. Instance Ship money, dispensations, and the present oppressive Proceeding of Britain. But even that Plea had no foundation here. The States were Competent to enact   Laws for the apprehending deserters, and there surely was no reason to doubt but that they would on a recommendation for that purpose. That the Inconvenience the Gentleman mentioned was Imaginary. It would not follow that desertion could not be prevented or punished altho it should be admitted that the states alone were Competent to give the Power of arresting suspected persons, and trying the Question deserter or not. Nor could it be concluded from this that deserters could be apprehended nowhere but in the states where they enlisted. That desertion was a Crime and like all other Crimes to be punished wherever it should be Committed, and by the Power who had Competent Jurisdiction. That the Crime Once Committed the offender might be apprehended in any state and removed to the Jurisdiction who had power to punish, but every Individual who might be Apprehended had a right to call for the Interposion of the state where he was Apprehended to Enquire whether he was a person liable to suspicion and whether the restraint of his Liberty was lawful or not, but the Power to Interpose in this manner could only be derived from the Internal Legislature [so?] the Power to arrest must be derived from the same source, or it would follow that the Citizens of each state might be restrained of their Liberty by an Authority not derived from themselves which could not subsist with freedom and Independance. Tis plain from these Considerations that desertion was no more secure of Impunity than Murder, for in both the offender must be arrested by Virtue of an authority derived from the state where found, and each must be tried by the Competent Jurisdiction and punished according to the Laws of the Community against which he offended. The amendment would [not] remove [the] objection because whether the word suspected was in or not [the objec]tion must remain the same. No one could be more than [suspected] before conviction, and the Question of Guilt or Innocence must be determined somewhere previous to punishment.  The Distinction between Magistrates as Magistrates, and as persons proper to execute resolves was incomprehensible. If any thing render them more proper than freeholders it was what distinguished them from Freeholders which certainly was being Magistrates, and what but their authority as Magistrates rendered them fitter for Executing the resolve? Twas surely their Power that was considered as rendering them more fit, and whence could they derive their Power but from their Quality as Magistrates? In fact it was an attempt to Convey authority from the Congress to the Magistrates of the states, which would Involve the Personal rights of every Citizen and which could be derived from no Power but the People of the respective states.  To Mr. Lee. The Difference is certainly very perceptable between offering reward to any Individual who shall apprehend Deserters and Subject them to the proper tribunals for deciding Concerning Guilt or  Innocence (for the advertisements could have no other Effect) and Impowering persons in the States to decide this Question, and to Imprison and remove out of the State in Consequence of such decision. The One was no more than Inviting people to run the hazard of an action for being mistaken, and to be dilligent in looking out for deserters by hopes of the reward, but the other was giving Power to Exercise discretion in deciding Guilt or Innocence, and Consequently of freedom and Imprisomnent, and Eventually Life and Death. That in the latter case no remedy could be had for the Injury, if the Congress could give the Power because the Magistrate must decide Judicially, and must be subject to no punishment for being Mistaken because every Judge undertook to use his best endeavors to discover Truth, but did not promise to be Infallible but the states would undoubtedly punish the Magistrate for acting without Jurisdiction, which would prove they did not admit the Power of Congress.  To Mr. Adams. The Congress was Impowered by the several States to levy an Army, and to conduct the War and the Government of the Army was Incident to that Power. The army could not be governed without rules and such rules were the articles of War which the Congress undoubtedly had a right to make, and every Soldier was particularly bound to submit to them, because he Consents to be governed by them, and tried and punished by them not by representatives merely but by actual person Consent, for they are read to him at the time of Inlistment But the Power of Congress could not extend to subject any other but such as enlisted and personally consented to the articles War, and it was the Duty of the states to Interpose whenever the Question arose whether Soldier or not, because otherwise their Citizens might be subjected to Martial Law against their Consent-and whenever any soldier apprehended the Courts martial exceeded their Jurisdiction he had a right to bring the matter before the Civil Tribunal of the state where he was because other wise the Military might become absolute and Independant of the Civil Authority.  During this Debate Mr. Wilson Instanced a Case where the Congress had Committed a man by their own Authority, and no objection made.  The Delegate from N.C. declared he was sorry to hear it, but would excuse it because he would suppose some special Circumstances of Necessity. He declared had he been present it should not have passed without Opposition and he hoped it never would be repeated for since no Power could call the Congress to account if they could Imprison, they might do the greatest wrong without any remedy, and the Liberty of America would be at the mercy of a Majority in Congress which might not Exceed five members because nine states make a Congress, and there are more than five represented by a single member.   The Question for adjournment to Philadelphia was carried in the negative.(3)  ""

I am sorry to hear from a Marblehead Whig, that the Tories are suffered to take the Lead; surely Skill is not wanted to regulate these unworthy people, & oblige them to promote the Cause from wch they wickedly have answered. The noble Steed (some of whose ordinary Qualities they seem to partake ), becomes a most useful Animal when properly disciplined; & neglected or enlarged soon contracts a Disposition troublesome, & refracting, however I think it will not be long before they'll receive their Quietus in America. By Letters from Mr Dean in France, the powers of Europe were expecting a formal Annunciation of our Independance at their respective Courts.(1) He thinks a general War in Europe inevitable; & to confirm the Intention of France, our Agent in the West Indies informs us that he saw a Letter from his most christian Majesty desiring the Commanding Officer at St Domingo (Who having been a considerable Time on that Station had requested Leave to return) in the most pressing Term to remain there till further orders as he would be immediately wanted to take the Command of a considerable Army in that Quarter.(2) This the officer has chearfully accepted. I have communicated to Messrs Samuel & Robert Purviance, the  FEBRUARY 25, 1777  part of your Letter that relates to them; & the Delegates of the Massachusetts B. having some Interest in their Hands belonging to the State, will probably have no Objection to the taking Mr Purviances Draught on You for such a part as he may want to fulfil your order, & endorsing the same to the assembly.

3337,dg006353,1777,Thomas Burke s Notes of Debates,"""Thomas Burke's Notes of Debates
  Feby 26th [1777] The Question came on again relative to Interest on Loan Certificates and (1) it was determined to give the Six per cent, Connecticut assenting and giving a Majority, because it drew Georgia with it.(2) There was an attempt to extend the Interest to the Certificates which should be given in payment of Lottery prizes, but it was rejected. The debates were long and troublesome, but unimportant. North Carolina was always against the Increase of Interest because the delegate Considered it (3) a resolution to carry on the war at 6 per cent Interest rather than four, and that any sum of money which might be Accumulated in the great cities even if they could be borrowed at six per cent yet the advantage arising from that acquisi[ti]on by no means Compensated for the increased interest at which the War must be carried on.  The question was put in the morning for an adjournment to Philada. All the Southern Delegates were against it except Georgia who always votes with Connecticut. The reasons were given that so much business of Consequence was before the Congress it was improper to suspend that Business by an adjournment at so busy a Season, that the weather was so bad, and several states so Circumstanced there was very little probability of the Congress meeting at Philadelphia in several weeks, that the General was of Opinion that the Enemy Intended an attack on Philadelphia and if they attempted it he had no force to stop them. In fine that it would be foregoing a certainty of doing Business for a very great uncertainty. For it, the only reason of any weight came from the Board of War which was that for want of Mechanics and Waggons the Business of their department went on very heavily at Baltimore. This was answered by observing that an adjournment would cause an entire suspension of that and all business, and there was no probability of an early meeting at Philadelphia. There was a peevish altercation on the Matter, and the delegate from North Carolina moved (4) to put off the Question on behalf of the Colony. A fierce debate insued. J. Adams, Doctr Witherspoon, Mr Wilson, Mr Sherman and some others alledged that it must be defered to a Majority whether the rule could apply to this case, and in short whether the Colony (5) should be permitted to exercise the right of postponing the Question. R.H. Lee with great perspicuity and force of Argument urged the violent Impropriety of putting such a Question at a time when a State attempted to avail itself of a Privilege reserved to each by the Original (6) Rules of the  FEBRUARY 26, 1777  Congress which Certainly formed its Constitution (7) and that if the rule was thought inconvenient the proper way would be to let the state first avail itself thereof and afterwards Consider the rule and alter and amend it if thought Necessary. F.L. Lee observed that the rule was originally intended to prevent a Majority from deciding on any matter with too much precipitation and if it was to be submitted to a Majority when it was proper to apply the rule, or when a State might avail itself of it, the Majority would always determine against applying it at all. Mr Haywood from S. Carolina urged that he thought it a very extraordinary kind of proposition to submit to a Majority whether that Majority should be checked by a Power absolutely reserved for that purpose in the Constitution of the Congress. The Delegate from North Carolina declared that he would enter into no Debate on the subject whether he should avail himself of a right which was reserved to every state in the Original Constitution of the Congress: that those rules must have been entered into by Common Consent, and nothing but Common Consent (8) could dispense with them, that if a Majority of Congress could vote away the rules of the Congress which Common Consent had Established they were a Body bound by no rule at all and only Governed by arbitrary discresion, that if this was the case no state was secure, a Majority might vote that two, three, four or five states should form a Congress, altho the present rule required nine, that the votes should not be by states but by voice Individually. In short any the smallest Number of the Delegates might take upon them the whole Authority of the Congress, that putting the right of the state to the Question was assuming to exercise an arbitrary tyrannical discretion and if it was done he should Consider it as a most violent invasion of the right of his State which he would endeavor to resent as became him, that if the Question was at all put he should be at no loss how to Conduct himself That he would always to the best of his Judgment make a prudent use of any privilege with which he was Invested, but he hoped he should always have firmness enough to do it maintaining the smallest Privilege of the state he represented. That gentlemen were exceedingly Mistaken if they deemed him a Man who would tamely suffer any (9) Invasion or encroachment on its Rights. That if that Assembly proceeded to so arbitrary and Tyrannical an exertion of Power he would Consider it as no longer that which ought to be trusted with the Liberties of their Fellow Citizens, and he would shape his Conduct accordingly. The Delegates of New Hampshire, Maryland, Virginia and South Carolina Joined in this very strenuously insisting that it was a most violent and arbitrary Act of Power to put any Question at all on this matter-and the others (some Individuals among them being of Opinion also with N.C.) perceiving the determined resolution of N.C. to withdraw from Congress if any such Question should be put, they waived their Opposition, and he exercised his right.(10)  ""

I wonder that you should hesitate about my Approbation of your Flight. It would have been worse than Death to you to have been exposed to the Insolence of the Tories. They would have triumphed more at your Captivity than Sawney and his Auditors did when they bid the Gates of Trinity lift up their Heads that they might enter in and devoutly curse the Friends to the Rights of Mankind.  The Time is fast approaching when the proud Hierarchy will sink like a Milstone never to rise any more; when the Sons of Freedom will triumph over the Minions of arbitrary Power. What tho' We should sacrifice our Peace and Interest for a Time, the Cause is worth our Lives. We leave to our Children, to Posterity the most inestimable of all Blessings. This Consideration supports and will I hope support me under all the Calamities I may be called to encounter in the glorious Struggle in which we are engaged.  I inquired of Dr Witherspoon, after your Son, when the good Doctor was obliged to quit the Jersey; but could get no Information concerning him. Indeed I never heard of him until I received your Letter. I lament  FEBRUARY 26, 1777  with you that he hath been drove from his Studies; for he is an agreeable promising Youth and bids fair to be serviceable to Mankind. I left Philadelphia the 13th of Decr. When I shall return is uncertain but I believe it will be soon; for Congress have the Matter of a Removal thither in Contemplation. When I go there I will see him if he should be there, and give him my best Advice, and hope you will do my Children the same Kindness. Philadelphia is so near the Scene of War, that I am suspicious it will not be favorable to his Studies; for the Muses fly from the Din of Arms. However History may be read and French may be learned without that close and uninterrupted Attention which the severer Studies of Mathematicks and Philosophy demand.  It grieves me to hear that the Continental Seamen have not been paid their Wages and Prize Money. Repeated Orders have been given to the Agent to have it done. The Congress are fully sensible of the Importance of having a respectable Navy, and have endeavoured to form and equip One; but through Ignorance and Neglect they have not been able to accomplish their Purpose yet. I hope however to see One afloat before long. A proper Board of Admiralty is very much wanted. The Members of Congress are unacquainted with this Department. As One of the Marine Committee I sensibly feel my Ignorance in this Respect. Under a mortifying Sense of this I wrote to you for Information in this Matter. Books cannot be had here; and I should have been glad to have been pointed to proper Authors on this Subject when I should be in a Place where Books may be had. Let me know whether it would suit you to be a Member of a Marine Board. I suppose Congress will institute One with a suitable competent Salary, there Residence to be I presume at Philadelphia. I should be exceedingly glad to be serviceable to you or any of the Friends to Liberty.  Since I wrote the foregoing I have seen and conversed with Dr. Witherspoon about your Son.(1) He tells me that he left your Son, the 20th of January at Prince-Town, that he hath the Use of his Books, that at that Place, he can better learn French, pursue other Studies, preserve his Morals and Health, than at Philadelphia. I am intirely of his Opinion. It is true that he may be again driven from Prince-Town; but he is without any Incumbrance, may easily take his cloaths, and push off on the Approach of the Enemy. He might too be drove from Philadelphia if he should reside there. So that upon the whole I think, with the learned Dr that Prince-Town is the most eligible Place. We have nothing new. The Enemy we hear are reinforced and it is thought that by their having dragged some heavy Cannon to Brunswick, and some other Circumstances that they mean to make a Movement; but what their Object will be is uncertain. Congress are taking Measures to reinforce Genl. Washington, until the regular Army shall be muster'd. Inlistments go on as fast as could be expected; and I hope that we shall early  in the Spring have a very respectable Army in the Field, and (2) [an] Army sufficient to vanquish our Foes.(3) Reprinted from Publications of the Rhode Island Historical Society 8 (January 1901), pp. 201-3, and ""

  Sir Philada. Feby 26th. 1777 The Sundry dispatches sent herewith arrived this morning and as General Washington is so very Urgent respecting the removal of all the Public Stores we shall urge the execution of the orders issued by us for that purpose last Week, altho we Still think there are insuperable obstackles to General Howe getting into this City but whilst our General is so strongly of opinion that an attack on this place is Meditated, it wou'd not be right for Congress to come here.(1) This is an unfortunate situation. Congress shou'd be here to superintend abundance of business & yet circumstances turn up at the instant they were coming, that make it imprudent. Your distance from us is too great & much Public business is retarded by it. The Expresses are frequently stopped at Susquehannah, Public officers totally at a loss for instructions in many departments and every department in constant want of money. We are amazed that Congress shou'd so peremtorily refuse to raise the Interest of money when it is so very evident to every body out of doors that it is the only measure left to supply them with money, now is the time to do it for shou'd you wait untill some fresh disaster to our Troops or some important Success of the Enemy raises again the hopes of Tories & fears of Whiggs, then comes your offer at six per Cent without producing any other effect than to make your Credit still worse than it is already and in the end you will be obliged to give ten instead of six per Cent for money to carry on the war. We cannot help mentioning this important matter very frequently as we conceive Congress are not so fully informed of their own Necessitys as we are. We conceive we do our duty in telling them of it and if  FEBRUARY 26, 1777  future Ill Consequences arise by this plan not being adopted, the error does not lye at our door. We think as the Congress has passed a Vote to remove from Baltimore they wou'd be better situated at Lancaster than where they are, as it is but one days journey from hence & no interrupted Ferry between, this move & raising the interest wou'd be very eligible measures at present and we have Stopped the Waggons from going down until your pleasure is signifyed.  Please to deliver the letter herein directed to Mr Morris, to the Committee of Secret Correspondance. We have the honor to remain with the utmost respect, sir, Your Obedt Servants,  Robt Morris  Geo Clymer ""

  Sir Philada Feby 26th 1777 We have this Night received from Congress the dispatches sent herewith. By these you will see the promotions that have taken place and that no deputation of Members of Congress are to meet Genl Lee, who I suppose will be much disapointed but surely he shou'd have pointed out more clearly the design of his request, as the consequences of complyance or even of the refusal may be important.(1) It wou'd appear from what we have lately heard that Genl. Howe intends sending him to England which we shall be sorry for, as such a measure may possibly involve in its consequences more destruction than either side really wish for. We have recommended to Congress either to remain where they are, or if they do remove to let it be to Lancaster which we think wou'd be much more convenient than Baltimore. The Public business meets great obstructions from their distance and the difficulties of getting dispatches backwards & forwards, they are exceedingly retarded by bad roads & the frequent stoppage at Susquehannah Ferry & in our oppinion when they did move they shou'd have gone to Lancaster, if they remove again before Genl. Howes designs are clearly evinced or frustrated, it shou'd be there. We Issued orders last Week to have all the Public Stores in readiness to remove from this place and are now urging to every department the propriety of carrying those orders into execution not only so far as relates to their being in readiness but as to the actual removing of them which we shall insist on in complyance with your repeated requisitions on this head.

  Sir Philada. Feby 26. 1777 I wrote you very lately on behalf of the Committee of Secret Correspondance(1) then & still at Baltimore, I then sent you a letter from them (2) & herewith is another. That letter I hope will be delivered you by Cap Nichs Biddle before you receive this, but the time when he may appear is very uncertain as he was out on a Cruize w hen those dispatches were sent in search of him. I then told you the situation of our affairs but some little alterations have since taken place.(3)  You will have seen by former advices that Kind Providence gave a change to the affairs of America on Christmas Night when Genl Washington begun an attempt to surprize Trenton which he effected the next morning & took Prisoners three Hessians Regiments. Soon after by a Master Stroke of Generalship He surprized, took & destroyed three other Regiments chiefly British at Prince Town. All this was done with Militia, a kind of Troops not to be depended on in a general Action in the open Field against a large, regular & well disciplined Army. Genl Washingtons experience taught him this lesson & his abilities enable him to make the proper use of such Troops as he has, therefore his aim was to change the Seat of War & draw the Enemy into a part of the Country favourable for the kind of War he knew was best for him & accordingly after the two Feats at Trenton & Prince Town he marched his small Army to Morris Town a Hilly Country in the Upper parts of the Jersey. The Enemy knowing their Stores were all lodged at Brunswick were obliged to follow him to secure that place and they were obliged to abandon all their other posts in the Jerseys for fear of having their Communications cut off, as happened at Elizabeth Town, Newark & Hackinsack where their parties & Guards were taken Prisoners. They therefore Seated themselves at Brunswick, threw up works there & at Amboy, thus the Shoars of Delaware were freed of them & the Citizens of Philadelphia relieved from their apprehensions of loosing their City this Winter. Genl Washington holds his Head Quarters at Morris Town, but has established posts all round Brunswick & altho they are superiour in Numbers, & our Army consists still chiefly of Militia, yet the Enemy are so penned in that they cannot move a Mile out of Town without being Attacked. They have lost a greater number of Horses & are much distressed for Forage to Subsist those they have left, therefore they send out Forageing parties once or twice a Week consisting of 2000 to 3000 Men. They are always attacked by some of ours and generally loose more or less Men, Waggons, Horses &c. Thus our people have continued to gall & harass them ever since they took Shelter within their lines at Brunswick & this is the Game Genl. Washington must wish to play untill our New Enlistments are compleat and the Men Embodied. In the Mean time the Enemy are grown sore & impatient under such rough usage, they are meditating some stroke  FEBRUARY 26, 1777  and continue publickly to threaten this City, whether they can execute their threats or not time alone can shew. Genl Howe is now at Brunswick in person and having ordered thither a large reinforcement from Rhode Island part of which are arrived, he may if he pleases move from Brunswick to Trenton provided he has Horses & Waggons sufficient left to Hall the Artillery, Stores, Forage, Provisions & bagage necessary for such an attempt which I very much doubt, and still the difficulty of Crossing Delaware occurs, beside that Genl Washington wou'd fall on his Rear and cut off his Communication with New York. Upon the whole I think the Enemys Situation is not what they wou'd wish, neither is ours what I wish it to be. Our New Enlistments go on briskly but the Men must be cloathed, Armed, embodied & in some degree disciplined before they can be formidable. Untill that is compleated our dependance is on Militia who will not be subject to severe discipline & they Consume & waste our Stores ten times more than our regular Troops. However if Genl. Howe gives us a little more time he will find himself in a bad box. The worst circumstances in our affairs at this period is the situation of Tyconderago which from the same fountain that all the disgrace America has yet suffered, is near being lost. I mean the short enlistments. It happens unfortunately that the times for which the Garrison that has held that post all winter were enlisted is expired & they have left it with only about 500 men. Therefore shou'd Mr Carleton Meditate a winter Expedition against that place as he has given out, he will probably succeed and at the same time I must tell you that very effectual measures are now taking to strengthen & support it, so that if Genl Carleton keeps off for a summer Campaigne he will be too late & make no better hand of it than he did last year. You will see by the News Papers sent herewith that the several States are getting into the exercise of Government. When that is fairly effected they will be able to suppress the Spirit of Toryisme & nothing else is wanted to make the American Arms vigorous & successfull. I shall not have time to write so full an acot of our affairs to the Commissioners at Paris as is Contained herein, therefore Request you will send them a Copy of this letter and both they and you will make proper use of the Contents promulgating what ought to be publickly known & suppressing the rest, as I give you things fairly as they stand for your & their own information.(4)  The Enemies Ships Gall us Confoundedly, they have taken a number of Valuable Vessells from us, however in spite of all their Vigilance we have got many Valueable supplys in this winter and still hope for many more. They have several Cruizers in Chesapeak Bay that stop the Trade of Maryland & Virginia at this time, but they will be tired of it by & by. They have left us at liberty here awhile & we are making the best use we can of the opportunity. I am sir, Your obedt hble servant,  Robt Morris  P.S. We have good Accounts from Tyconderago this day & I think they indicate strongly that we have not much to fear in that quarter. Genl. Howe I believe is determined to attack this place & he may succeed but if he does it will be his ruin in the end, however a deep snow is fallen that makes vastly against his movements and the chance is still much in our fayour. We hear this day of Doctr Franklins arrival in France. Yours &c, R M  ""

We are getting the Caroline (a ship of 600 hogsheads) ready with all expedition, and propose ordering her to Mr. Stephen Stewart to load, because he says that about 400 hogsheads of his purchase are not of quality to venture being kept. The Brig we purchased will be ordered to Messrs. Hunters, and we think of directing a small Ship to Rappahannock that we are agreeing for with Mr. Dugan which lays now at Dartmouth, and which we have proposed to charter on terms reasonable enough for the Continent.(3) We think it wise to inlarge our purchase of tobo. before the rage of excessive demand contaminates Virginia as it has done this and the Northern States. With this view we have desired Mr. Thomas Jett a Merchant of established reputation at Leeds Town in the Northern Neck to purchase one thousand hogsheads on the most reasonable terms he possible can.

  [February 27, 1777] The Question for adjournment came on again and Virginia, South Carolina and Maryland strenuously opposed it as exceedingly impolitic and Improper. Their arguments were very Conclusive but entirely ineffectual. North Carolina only observed that he would give his dessent on such Terms as might make an Impression on the memory of the Gentlemen present, that he would spare this could he enter it on the Journals but since he could not he must provide by this means for his Defence, in case he should be Impeached hereafter for any thing passing in Congress, he must expect to call on the Gentlemen as Witnesses how he voted, since he could not produce the Testimony of the Journals. That he was sorry to perceive that a predetermined Majority was as much a Ratio ultima in Congress as in the British Parliament. That he was no way anxious for FEBRUARY 27, 1777  the personl safety of Congress, he believed if they were all killed or Captivated public Business would Suffer no other Injury except the delay until other members could be chosen, that he knew his Country had much better men than himself; and he believed every State has as good as any in Congress, but he would give his Negative for the plain reason that it was very Imprudent to put a certain stop to Important Business, and run a very precarious hazard of resuming it again even after an Interval of some Weeks which would be an Inevitable delay. The adjournment was carried, for it M.B., R.I., Connecticut, N.J., Pennsylvania, Georgia; against it New Hampshire, Maryland, Virginia, N. Carolina, S. Carolina.(1) The same day Mr Chase from Marsland offered a resolution for entering all the Proceedings whether passing in the negative or affirmative on the Journals, and the Yeas and No's if any state required it, also that the Congress doors should be opened, except on particular Occasions, and all Debates held in public. He was Seconded by North Carolina who observed it was very proper the Congress should have the public check on them, and that as every member was liable to be impeached by the State he represented, it was a Justice to him and to the State that his votes should be entered on the Journals, that the state might be furnished with Testimony to prosecute, and the delegate with Testimony to defend himself--postponed.(2)  ""

  My dear Sir, Baltimore Feby. 27th 1777 My brother Delegates are of opinion that the inclosed papers may avail you something in settling some disputes about rank that may come before you, and therefore it is sent.(1) Congress never did anything in this matter, as the business was put into other hands. I realy think that when the history of this winters Campaign comes to be understood, the world will wonder at its success on our part. With a force rather inferior to the enemy in point of numbers, and chiefly militia too, opposed to the best disciplined troops of Europe; to keep these latter pent up, harrassed, and distressed-but more surprising still, to lessen their numbers some thousands by the sword and captivity! All this Sir must redound to your glory, and to the reputation of the few brave men under your command. But whilst I wonder at your success, I am realy astonished at the supineness of the people, to suffer your army to be so thin, whilst a cruel, implacable enemy is in the Country, and have providentially put themselves in the way of destruction, if the numbers of people that are not far off, would turn out for the purpose! We have done every thing in our power to hasten up the new Levies, and strengthen your hands, but the want of arms and cloaths, with the small pox obstructs and delays us prodigiously. Industry and patience will I hope surmount all obstacles, and at length collect an army together that will bid defiance to despotism, and secure the liberties of North America. About a fortnight ago, I received a letter from London, written by a well informed friend, which contains this paragraph and is dated Octr. 9th last. \""The war is likely to go on another year, in which case Cheasapeak Bay will be the seat; a plan for that purpose has been laid before Ld. Geo. Germaine & it is said is approved. The Eastern Shore is the first object, or place of landing.\"" This letter reached me just as three or 4 large Ships came lately into our Bay, and the Tory rising on the Maryld. Eastern Shore seemed to denote the beginning of this plan. But since, we learn that the Ships are gone & the Tories dispersed. My Informant is however so good, that I cannot help thinking something like a diversion, at least, will be attempted there next Campaign. I cannot think they mean to relinquish their grand plan of joining their Canadian with Howes army. This consideration has ever made me wish that Ticonderoga, and the avenues leading to Canada, were well attended to, that the vigilance and Military talents of Gen. Carleton may be disappointed.  We are informed by our Agent in Martinique (2) 7th of Jany. that a Spanish General, in a Frigate bound to S. America, called at that place in distress, sought opportunities of assuring him of the King of Spains good will to assist these States, and that a loan of money might be obtained from that Court. He further said that a land and Sea force was gone to South America, where hostilities were before that time commenced with  FEBRUARY 27, 1777  Portugal. The French finances are low, but the Spanish are not so, and the opportunity is so tempting that I think a general war in Europe unavoidable. At least, I hope so. I have sent you inclosed, the translation of a letter from Doctr. De Bourg to Doctr. Franklin which lately came to the Committee of Secret Correspondence. It furnishes much useful information, and evidences the old Gentlemans strong attachments to our cause. He is a Philosopher, a Physician, and a friend to America-And his interest at Court very considerable.  I have now to ask your pardon for this long letter, it is against my plan of not disturbing you, but perhaps it may be excused as I do it but seldom.

I shall now point out employmt. for the Brigt that will probably be more agreable to you than the other, it is this; fit her out instantly, put onboard some of the Wines & Porter you mention with a little Rum, Sugar &c no great Value perhaps £500 to £600 Lawfull Money at most, dispatch her immediately for Virginia with orders to the Captain to go up James River to Colo Banisters Mills & from thence send an Express to Colo Carter Braxton at Cherry Cook near New Castle on York River Virginia. Mr. Braxton will immediately give orders for receiving the Goods he brings & to have him loaden with flour with which he may proceed back to your address. I have Perfect confidence both in Mr Braxton & you, and am therefore convinced the business of buying & selling will be managed to the best advantage on both sides. This business if you please shall be divided into thirds, one third your Acct., one third Mr Braxtons & one third mine, that is if he agrees to it. If not it shall be half your Acct & half mine.

These two Vessells if lucky may keep you supplyed with flour all next Summer and the price in Virginia will be cheaper than here or at Balto. The Cargoes shall each voyage be charged at the Current price there whether it be more or less than my Contract which being for 10,000 barrells will lead me into a heavy advance of money & I ought to get some thing by it. You will no doubt get carefull good Skippers that know your Coast well & if they go far enough off before they stand in for Virginia Capes I think there is not much danger, but beside this Concern I shou'd like also to have another Vessell if to be bought reasonably to execute the Georgia & Martinico plan and hope you will expect the whole, and in order to supply you with present Funds for my part I send you beside the Two thousand Dollars already mentioned Loan office Notes for Four Thousand Dollars bearing Interest of 4 per cent. I expect the Continental Interest must be raised to six per Cent as your State & others give it, therefore I cannot doubt but these Notes will command the cash when wanted, you will therefore keep them for my Acct. until you invest the money as above directed & then you'l Credit me for the Interest due to that time. Shou'd you not make any other purchases you'l keep the Notes for my Acct. untill further orders. I am advised from Balto. that the British Ships of War have left Chesapeak Bay; if so its likely they will visit ours again. I am sir, Your Obedt hble servt, Robt Morris  ""

  Dear Sir Philada. Feby 27th. 1777 You will receive herewith Copy of a letter I wrote you the 11th Jany on Commercial matters, also Copy of one dated 31st Jany respecting my Brother. The Contents of both are hereby Confirmed and I am sorry it is not in any power to own the receipt of any fresh letters from you or him. The state of suspence I am left in makes me very uneasy especially on his Account, however I must wait with patience to have my doubts cleared up & hope it will be done more to my satisfaction than my present (doubts) fears suggest.  I have not received any Goods from you or him, neither have I heard of any being sent by you either for this place or the West Indies. If you have from any cause that I am unacquainted with Neglected doing it, you may have leisure to repent hereafter that you missed so fine an opportunity of making a Fortune. The prices of all Imported Articles have been enormously high. I coud have sold any quantity of European Manufactures for 500 to 700 per Cent and bought Tobo for 25/ to 30/ per Cent. It is not yet too late, but Goods are becoming rather more plenty & Tobacco is rising, but there is plenty of room to make as much money as you please and if insurance could be obtained in Europe it might be reduced to a certainty even if you gave a premium of 5 per Cent which however is vastly too high. I think some good hand might be found to go over to London & manage such Insurances there. They love high premiums & will insure any thing for money but this woud really be to their advantage as I dont think we have lost above a fourth or at most a third of the inward bound vessells. I am sorry to tell you there are now two or three British Men of War in Chesapeak Bay. They have taken the Ship Farmer, Cap Dashiel, which had on board 500 hogsheads of Tobo on the Public Account & 50 hogsheads on my Acct was bound for Nantes Consigned to Messrs Pliarne, Penet & Co. They have for the present blocked up several others there but we shall get them away by & by. Some ships have lately got away from hence and we shall keep waiting all opportunities to push remittances to you. I do not like to enumerate the different Concerns going forward because it opens our designs to the Enemy shou'd the letters unfortunately fall into their hands.(1)  At present I will not enlarge but in hopes of hearing from you soon remain, Dr sir, Your affectionate Friend & Servant, Robt Morris  ""

  Dear Sir Philada. Feby 27th. 1777 I have your fayour of the 22d Inst.(1) which wears a very serious countenance and the opinion I entertain of the Strength of your Judgement and propriety of your observations, creates doubts in my mind which I confess I had discarded, as to the safety of this City. From various accounts I have been taught to believe that the Enemy have since Christmass lost so many Horses, are in such want of Forage, and their remaining Cavalry so worn down, that the defects in this department alone wou'd render any Movement of their Main body impossible without strong reinforcements. If such be their situation, a reinforcement of men without fresh & large supplys of Horses, waggons & Forage, wou'd only embarras them, and oblige 'em the sooner to quite their present station, and probably this may still happen, but when I find you so very Urgent to have the public Stores removed from hence, knowing as you must, that the expence & loss or Waste arising by such removal, amounts almost to the same thing as a total destruction of them It serves to convince me I have been misinformed as to the real state of the Enemy with respect to Horses, Waggons & Forage, especially as you don't say one Word of their deficiencys in these articles that I remember. I have therefore complyed litterally with your wishes & the Committee have given orders to every department to remove all Stores not immediately wanted, as fast as they can.  It seems to me however that the Enemy will be pressed with very great difficultys in their designs on this place. Allowing some degree of truth to their want of Horses, Waggons and Forage, those wants will be infinitely more felt since the late fall of Snow than before, for the Snow before it melts will exceedingly impede the motions of the stoutest Horses. They will require more dry food as nothing can be got from the sod and the difficulty of obtaining such food, as I apprehend, will be greatly encreased by your parties particularly the Rifle Men. When the Snow melts it will render the Road totally impassible for the Carriages must then be dragged through mud instead of Snow, in short my Dear Sir I cannot help conceiving that General Howe's situation somewhat resembles that of a strong Bull in Trammells, sensible of his own strength, he grows mad with rage & resentment when he finds himself deprived of the use of it. The Bull may not so well understand the causes of his disapointment & therefore may be more patient & I fancy if my picture has any resemblance to the truth patience wou'd be of great use to the  FEBRUARY 27, 1777  British Commander. If you find him embarrassed in these trammells provided by kind Providence I hope you will be able to teaze & harrass him untill our New Enlistments shall put him in your power, or oblige him to take shelter onbd the Shipping provided for that & other purposes.  I do not like to be too sanguine & yet it is very necessary in a Contest like this we are engaged in to view the best side of the Picture frequently. Remember good Sir, that few men ever keep their feelings to themselves, & that it is necessary for example sake that all leaders shoud feel & think bold in order to inspirit those that look up to them. Heaven (no doubt for the noblest purposes) has blessed you with a Firmness of mind, Steadiness of Countenance and patience in sufferings that give you infinite advantages over other men. This being the case you are not to depend on other Peoples exertions being equal to your own. One mind feeds & thrives on misfortunes by finding resources to get the better of them, another sinks under their weight, thinking it impossible to resist and as the latter description probably includes the majority of mankind we must be cautious of alarming them. Under this Idea I have been backward about removing the public stores, well knowing that a panic is sooner caused than retrieved, and I confess myself much hurt at finding you concerned. Your admonitions on that score were not attended to; during our greatest alarm here and when our prospects were of the worst, when my inward feelings were most wrung, I put a good face on things and was then Convinced it was of infinite use. I hate deception and cannot wish anything like it shou'd ever escape you, but I really think if the bright side of our affairs were sometimes to be painted by your pen or sanctifyed by your name it wou'd draw forth the exertions of some good men sooner than distress does from others. I hope you will excuse me for this stile of writing which almost amounts to the confidential. Was I sure of such being received in the same light in which I write it, I shou'd lament to you the absence of many great good & valueable Men from Congress, for if great care is not taken, that Body, so respectable from the Nature of the appointment, the Importance of its objects, and the respectable Characters of its heretofore individual Members, will loose great part of its Weight & Consequences in the Eyes of our own People. We have now to lament the absence from the Public Councils of America, of a Johnson, a Jay, R. R. Livingston, Duane, Deane, W. Livingston, Franklin, Dickenson, Harrison, Nelson, Hooper, Rutledge & others not less conspicuous, without any proper appointments to fill their places, and this at the very time they are most wanted, or wou'd be so, if they had not very wisely supplied the deficiency by Delegating to your Excellency Certain powers that they durst not have entrusted to any other man. But what is to become of America & its cause if a constant fluctuation is to take place amongst its Counsellors & at every change we find reason to view it with regret? However this is deviating from my own plan. I am holding up the wrong side of the picture, altho I am one of those People  who think the best part of the Community will ultimately swim at top, notwithstanding others get uppermost during the general jumble, and I can see the way to liberty & happiness through the Cloud or mist before us. I beg your pardon for takeing up so much of your time & remain Your Excellencys most Obedt & very hble Servant,  Robt Morris P.S. I venture to tell Mr Tilghman here that I recd his letter & sent the enclosure to his Father. I hope my letter herewith to Genl Lee may go in safe & the Money be pd to him.  ""

  My dear Colonel, Baltimore Febry. 28. 1777 I was well pleased to find by yours of the 21st Jan. that you were in good health & spirits; may you long continue so. You will no longer accuse the Congress of timidity, when you know it has adjourned to meet next week in Philadelphia,(1) and I assure you it is as much in Genl. Howe's power to come there now, as it was when we left it. He has bro't a large reinforcement from Rhode Island, & has now at least [ ] men in the Jerseys; Genl. Washington, has not above 4,000, the greater part militia most of the troops for the new Army, as yet collected, being under inoculation. Our worthy genl. has indeed made a most glorious winter campaigne. He has never had above 5000 men, tho three times that number have often been under arms, marching to & from the Camp; militia like. It will hardly be beleived in Europe, that it cou'd be contrived,  FEBRUARY 28, 1777  with such a handfull or raw militia, to gain such great advantages over 7 or 8000 well appointed regulars. However if Mr. Howe makes use of the present opportunity, we may suffer a good deal. Our hope is, that the small number & leaness of his horses, will make it difficult for him to move his artillery; in which alone they put their trust. Indeed it will be some time before we shall be able to take the feild, with any thing of a respectable Army, for the militia has not only exhausted our treasury, but plunder'd us of arms, blankets & every other necessary which was provided for the new Army. We have many good vessels abroad to repair the damage but it cannot be done soon; so that we must continue for some time longer, to scramble thro' our difficulties. These little alarms will habituate our people to look danger & distress in the face, for, all things consider'd, we may think ourselves well off, if at last we are victorious after suffering much more than we have done. I do not mean to doubt our being victorious, but we may suffer much, unless France & Spain give us a little respite. This we have some reason to expect, for our last intelligence was from our Agent at Martinique, a large Spanish armament was gone to S. America. The Genl. put into Martinique & inform'd him that he might be assured hostilities were by that time commenced against the Portuguese. He often took occasion to assure him of the friendship of his Master for the American States, & that he wou'd assist them in any manner that might be most serviceable. The Agent likewise saw a Letr. from the K. of France to the Genl. of the Islands, who had some time before sollicited leave to return home; in which the King conjures him, by his regard for his Country & love of Him, to remain there to take the command of his Army which wou'd soon require an Officer of the greatest abilities. We soon expect authentic intelligence from France, which will enable us to judge with some certainty of this matter.  I hope you will continue vigourously to counteract the despondency, which I am sorry to hear you say, prevails in Virginia. She is consider'd as the most spirited state in the Union, & I hope will maintain the character her Sons have acquired immortal honor abroad; 'twou'd be a pity, it shd. be tarnished by any timidity at home.  Goddard you will see has published your paper, I wish it may have a proper influence upon whom it may concern. He shall send you his Gazette. As I suppose you cannot have the benefit of the papers I send to Mt. Airy, as usual, I have sent you several in which you will find many things to please & divert you. Genl. Lee lately wrote to Congress, desiring a comtee to confer with him on his & public affairs. It was consider'd as a sneaking trick of Howe's, to hold out the delusive idea of treaty & reconciliation & thereby throw a langour upon our preparation; and therefore instantly & unanimously rejected.(2) But the tories are making their use of it, by asserting that honorable terms of peace have been offer'd us, but surely our people will not always continue to be  the dupes of these infamous wretches. Our best respects to Mr C., Lady & family. Adieu my dear Col. Francis Lightfoot Lee  ""

I hope by this time a Sufficient force are at  FEBRUARY 28, 1777  & on their march to Ticonderoga for the defence of that Place, Congress are very sensible of the importance of it, and have done every thing in their Power to render the post secure. What remains to be done remains intirely with the executive, which is to raise the men & direct their operations. I suppose all the Troop from N.H. will be order'd to the Northward, Col. Poor is promoted to the Rank of Brigadier & I suppose will have the immediate command of those Troops. This Gentn is highly recomended by the Genls under whom he has serv'd & I hope will do Honor to his Country.  No accounts yet from our Commissioners at Foreign Courts. The last advice from France was 25th Octo by which there seems to be no doubt of a Europian war. Our agent at Martinico writes that he had seen a letter from the K of F to the Genl. of Hispaniola (who had asked leave to go home) desiring him to tarry as he wanted an experienced officer to command his Troops in America.(1) We have many hints of this sort which discovers that both F. & S. are dispos'd to break with Britain. A Spanish Genl. in his way to Cuba call'd at Martinica, & while there took every oppor of confering with our Agent & assur'd him that his Master wo'd do every thing in his power to serve the United States & only waited for proper application which (inter nos) I expect has been made before this time. In short our affairs so far as relates to foreign Powers wear as favorable an aspect as we can Expect. The greatest difficulty we have to incounter is to keep up the credit of our Currency which must be done by Taxing the People, & clearing the Country of its Enemies, for those people who are commonly call'd Tories do more mischief in that way then we are aware of.

I am at last got to think more about my own Expences than any Thing else. Twenty dollars a Cord for Wood. Three Pounds a Week for Board, meaning Breakfast, Dinner, and bed-without one drop of Liquer, or one Spark of light or fire. I am lost in an ocean of Expence. Horse feed in Proportion-five hundred Sterling will not pay my Expences for this year-at this Rate.(3)  Pray make every Body who has Money lend it, that Things may not grow worse.  The loan office in this Town is very successfull.  ""

  Sir, Philadelphia March 6th. 1777 A Mr. Jackson, One of the Managers of the Continental State Lottery, called upon Me this Morning, told Me that he was going to the Eastern States with Tickets, and desired Me to recommend to him some suitable Person or Persons, in our State, with whom he might lodge a Number of them for Sale.  I told him that your Honor was better acquainted with proper Persons than myself, and would readily point him to them. Agreeable to his Request I therefore Recommend him to your Notice and beg that you would advise to whom to apply.  As a State Lottery is one of the Measures that Congress hath taken to put a Stop to the Torrent of Depretiation, I hope it will be countenanced and encouraged by the State of Rhode Island and that the Loan-Office too will be patronized and promoted. The Interest on the Loan-Office Certificates was lately raised to Six per Centum, which I should think would be a sufficient Inducement to Money-Lenders to lend their Money; especially when it is considered that if large Sums of Money can be borrowed it will tend greatly to check the sinking Credit of Continental Money, and thereby benefit them as well as others. Congress have Resolved that the Paper Bills issued by the States might be received at the Loan-Office and exchanged for Certificates; and that the Bills so received should remain there, and go as far as they might towards the Payment of the continental Debt due to the respective States;(1) and accordingly Letters to this Purpose have been transmitted to the Keepers of the Loan-Offices in the several States. I mention this the more particularly; because it will probably prevent Congress from ordering the Commissioner of the Loan-Office in our State to issue Notes for the Payment of the Debt due to it, which is a Mode pointed out by you in Case it should be impracticable to supply Messrs. Greene & Hoell with the Money asked for.(2) I returned here the Day before yesterday. The Weather hath been so bad as to prevent Members enough from coming up to make a Congress. As soon as they meet I shall use my Influence to procure an Order on the Treasury for the Money; but not with any Hopes of Success at present; for there is not more than a Million Dollars in the Treasury, and that Sum is already mortgaged. I wish  MARCH 6, 1777  I had been notified of the Intention of the State to send Persons here for Money, before they had sent them. In that Case I would have advised to postpone the Matter until the Five Million of Dollars which are ordered to be struck should have been completed. However I will do all I can in this as well as every Matter directed by the State of Rhode Island &c; and hope I shall be able to get some Money altho' I utterly despair of obtaining a Quarter Part now of what is due. The President will I presume transmit to you the Resolves recommending it to the States not to emit more money; nor borrow at a higher Rate of Interest than Six per Cent, &c &c.  I am much obliged by the Information you have given Me; and should be glad to receive at least the Substance of all public Acts as soon as may be convenient after the rising of the Assembly; for beside the Disadvantages which may follow from Ignorance, it is a Shame for a Delegate not to be able to tell what is done in his own State.  We have nothing remarkable from the Army in the Jersey. In a Skirmish, last Sunday Week, between 800 of our Men and the Reinforcement from Rhode-Island, consisting at least of 1700, some say upwards of Two thousd. Men, our Troops had much the Advantage. We killed 50 of the Enemy at least and wounded in Proportion, took it is said a few Prisoners and a small Matter of Camp Equipage, with the Loss on our Side of only 3 or 4 Men. Some Accounts say that We killed and wounded 504: but this I believe is beyond the Truth. I rejoice to hear that General Spencer is meditating an Attack on Rhode Island. I wish that he may collect force enough to make it successfull. It is of great Importance to take Advantage of the divided State of the British Army.  I continue to be with great Esteem and Consideration, Yr. Honor's most obedt. hble Servt. William Ellery  P.S. I write under a great Head-Ach occasd. by a bad Cold, in great Haste and upon such Paper as I could get at my Lodgings, therefore I hope I shall be pardoned. I hope my new Colleague will come on as soon as possible.(3) W E ""

  Dear Sir, Philada. March 6th. 1777 I am honoured with yours of the 2d Inst.(1) The good opinion you are pleased to entertain of me makes me very happy because there is no mans opinions I reverence more and that very circumstance is at the same time the source of trouble in my mind as you force me to abandon that Idea of Security which I was desirous of maintaining. It is truely lamentable that we have never been able to this day to Conquer that Land, a mental error made in the outset, by short enlistments, it was not untill Conviction of the absolute necessity of it Stared every man in the Face that the wholesome measure of enlisting for three years or during the War, cou'd be carried in Congress & since it was carried there, it meets with insuperable obstacles raised by the former practice, for the Bounties, high wages & short Service has Vitiated the Minds of all that Class of People & they are grown the most mercenary beings that exist. Dont confine this observation meerly to the Soldiery but extend it to those who get their livings by Feeding & entertaining of them, these are the Harpies that injure us much at this time. They keep the Fellows Drunk whilst the Money holds out, when it is gone they encourage them to enlist for the sake of Bounty, then to drinking again. That Bounty gone & more money still wanted, they must enlist again with some other officer, receive a fresh Bounty & get more Drink &c. This Scene is actually carrying on here daily & does immense injury to the recruiting Service, but still I hope our New army will be got together before long, at least so many as will enable you to put a good Face towards your Enemies and if that is accomplished I think they will not Venture this way. At present it seems to be their object and in your situation I really do not see what is to prevent their taking possession of it, unless the want of Horses, Forage &c retards their movements or renders it impracticable for them to come on. In the mean time the public Stores are removing, and Congress have adjourned back to this place, many of the Members are come up & the rest on the road. I dont expect they will make a House sooner than Monday, but your late dispatches shall be delivered to the President soon as he arrives. I wish with you Sir that they had Complyed with General Lees request, and when I sent forward those dispatches to Baltimore I wrote my Sentiments to some of the members & altho it wou'd have been inconvenient for me and I urged not to be appointed on that errand yet I wou'd have gone rather than he shou'd have been disapointed. Whether they will take up the matter again or not I don't know, but I much doubt it as from the little conversation I have had with some of the members now here they seem very averse to it. However I expect this matter as well as the  MARCH 6, 1777  Confinement of the Hessian Field officers will at least be referred to the Consideration of a Committee in Consequence of your letters on the Subject and if I can influence a Complyance with your wishes it will give me pleasure for my own Sentiments coincide with yours exactly in these two points. At the same time I must hint to you what I take to be one of the most forgive arguments that probably has been used in Congress against this Measure, I have not heard that it was used, but as it occured at the Court of France shou'd they hear as they undoubtedly wou'd that to myself on reading Genl Lee's letters, I mean the effect it may have members of Congress Visited Genl Lee by permission of the British Commissioners. The meeting with Ld Howe at Staten Island last Summer injured Mr Deane's negotiations much & retarded supplys intended for us (2)  ""

  Honored Sir Philadelphia March 4th [i.e. 6] 1777(1) The Congress adjourned from Baltimore last Thursday to meet in this City yesterday (2) but a Sufficient Number of Members did not come in to proceed to business. It was found very inconvenient to set at so great a distance from the Seat of War especially at a time when a new army is forming. Orders have been lately Issued to reinforce the Army in New Jersy by calling in all the new recruits, and the neighbouring Militia. The reason given in the resolution is \""The Congress being earnestly desirous to Strengthen the Army under General Washington's immediate Command So as to enable him not only to curb the Enemy & prevent their ravaging the Country & obtaining any supplies or provisions or forage, but by the Divine blessing totally to Subdue them before they can be reinforced.\"" (3)  It appears to me that a vigorous exertion at this time might be attended with very happy consequences, if not totally put an end to the war, for by the best accounts the enemy are in great want of many necessaries, and much dispirited, and tis thought if they were closely pursued with Superior or equal numbers they would be obliged to Submit. Congress never gave any orders at any time not to risque a general Battel as was reported last Fall, but always left that matter to the discretion of the Commanding Officers. Congress has considered the resolutions of the Committees of the four New England States, approves of the measures for the Defence of Rhode Island, and those recommended for the Support MARCH 6, 1777  of their paper currencies, but do not think it advisable to Issue Bills on Interest. I think that would have no good effect, it might Interfere with the continental loans & would in my opinion burthen the particular States with a useless expence. The evils occasioned by the fluctuating and exorbitant prices of things is very sensibly felt here. Congress has referred the considering of the doings of the New England Governments as to fixing the prices of articles, to the consideration of the other States, recommending to them to appoint Commissioners to meet for that purpose & to adopt Some plan to remedy the evils aforesaid. The middle States from New York to Virginia inclusive are to meet the third Tuesday in this month.(4) Congress has Agreed to allow 6 per cent per annum on any monies borrowed or to be borrowed on loan office Certificates being informed from Massachusetts and Philadelphia that money could not be obtained on a lower Interest, moneyed men being unwilling to lower their incomes when the prices of all necessaries are greatly increased. The best way to preserve the Credit of the currency & render the price of articles Stable is to raise the Supplies for carrying on the war by Taxes as far as possible, & the rest by loans. It Seems to be the present opinion of the Congress that there be no further Emission of Bills than what is already ordered if it can possibly be avoided, and that the most effectual measures be taken to Support the Credit of those already emited. Accordingly a Tax is recommended to the Several States, and as the rule to determine the Quotas is not yet Established by the legislatures of the Several States (which is to be done by the Confederation) each State is called upon to raise as large a Sum as circumstances will admit, with an Engagement to allow Interest at 6 per cent for what any State may raise more than its Just Quota of the whole Sum that Shall be raised.(5)  I suppose the expences of the current year will not be less than twenty million dollars, but perhaps more unless the enemy's Army Should be subdued before they can be reinforced or a diversion given to the British Arms by a war with France. I wish that I could furnish your Honr with printed copies of the Journals of Congress to this time; but notwithstanding the utmost endeavours of Congress to have them printed here, they have by one excuse or other been delayed, sometimes the printers complain of the want of paper, at other times their workmen are obliged to go with the Militia into the Field. Orders have lately been given to the Committee to agree with some printer who will perform the work.  Your Honr has doubtless been informed of the promotions lately made of General Officers in the army. Previous to the choice the Congress resolved, \""That in the appointment of General officers due regard shall be had to the line of Succession, personal merit, and the number of troops raised or to be raised by the several States.\"" (6) We mentioned Brigadiers Wooster and Arnold as candidates for Major generals on the two first principles, & Brigadier Wadsworth and Colo Huntington, who were   both recommended by General Washington, as fit persons for Brigadiers; but the last principle prevailed to pass them all by-viz, That Connecticut had more General Officers than in proportion to the number of Troops furnished by that State.  By a letter from Mr Dean dated Octr 25th, no authenticated account of these States having declared themselves independent had been received by him, so that nothing material had been transacted by him, except Some contracts for Goods. We have accounts in the newspapers that Doctr Franklin arrived in France the 7th of December last, but Congress has not received any Letters from him since his arrival. By the best accounts from France & Spain they are disposed to favour our cause.  I wish to know your Honrs opinion what would be most agreable to our State as to providing for the Sick in the army, whether to have it done by Congress or each State to provide for their own troops, & whether Doctr. Turner would not be a Suitable person to be recommended as Director of a Hospital on the East side of Hudson's River, or where ever else the N.E. Troops may be stationed, or whether any other person in either of the N.E. States would be more Suitable or acceptable for Such an appointment We were Honored with the receipt of one of your Honor's letters at Baltimore, but my papers not being here I cant refer to the date wherein your Honr mentions that it will be most Agreable to the other Gentlemen Delegates for two of them to come together. I think it would be well to have a fuller representation at this time, and as but two, & part of the time but one has attended for a considerable time past, if four Should attend for Some time, the expence would not be more than if three had attended the whole time.  Doctr. Jackson, one of the Managers of the Lottery of the united States by whom I expect to send this, is on a Journey through New England to dispose of the lottery tickets. He requested me to recommend to him Suitable persons in Connecticut to receive a number of them for Sale. I accordingly recommended Thaddeus Burr Esqr. in Fairfield County, Samll. Bishop Esqr. in New Haven & John Lawrence Esqr. in Hartford and took the Liberty to refer him to your Honr to advise him to Suitable persons in the Eastern counties. I me[ntioned] Doctr. Smith for Litchfield County.  I am, very respectfully, your Honrs Obedient, humble Servant,  Roger Sherman P.S. General Wolcott is well.  ""

They have frequent Skirmishes, and the Enemy generally come off second best. Whether We shall stay long here is uncertain. If We remove it will not be far.  This will go by Dr. Jackson one of the Managers of the Lottery. I hope it will find you all well.  I conjecture you have cold Weather and snow enough. We had at Baltimore last Saturday and Sunday a deep Snow and very sharp frost, such as froze over the Susquehannah, and obliged Us to ride up 15 miles, to cross the River at Bald fryars. We found a deep snow all the Way to this Place.  Maryland and Pensilvania, have at last compleated their Governments. Mr. Johnson is Governor of the first and Thomas Wharton Jur. of the other.

It gives me great Pleasure to find that you have received so many Letters from me, altho I knew they contained nothing of importance. I feel a Restraint in Writing like that which you complain of, and am determined to go on trifling. However, the Post now comes regularly, and I believe you may trust it.  I am anxious and impatient to hear of the March of the Massachusetts Soldiers for the new Army. They are much wanted.  This City is a dull Place, in Comparason of what it was. More than one half the Inhabitants have removed into the Country, as it was their Wisdom to do-the Remainder are chiefly Quakers as dull as Beetles. From these neither good is to be expected nor Evil to be apprehended. They are a kind of neutral Tribe, or the Race of the insipids.  How may possibly attempt this Town, and a Pack of sordid Scoundrels male and female, seem to have prepared their Minds and Bodies, Houses and Cellars for his Reception: but these are few, and more despicable in Character than Number. America will loose nothing, by MARCH 7, 1777  Hows gaining this Town. No such Panick will be spread by it, now as was spread by the Expectation of it in December.  However, if We can get together Twenty thousand Men by the first of April, Mr. How will scarcly cross Delaware River this Year. New Jersey may yet be his Tomb, where he will have a Monument very different from his Brothers in Westminster Abbey.(1)  I am very uneasy that no Attempt is made at Rhode Island. There is but an handfull left there, who might be made an easy Prey. The few invalids who are left there are scattered over the whole Island, which is Eleven Miles in length and three or four wide. Are New England Men such Sons of Sloth and Fear, as to loose this Opportunity?  We may possibly remove again from hence, perhaps to Lancaster or Reading. It is good to change Place-it promotes Health and Spirits. It does good many Ways-it does good to the Place We remove from as well as to that We remove to-and it does good to those who move.  I long to be at Home, at the Opening Spring, but this is not my Felicity. I am tenderly anxious for your Health and for the Welfare of the whole House.  ""

  My Dr sir, Philada Friday Evening March 7th. 1777.  Congress have once more Ventured to this Town, where I shall be glad to hear from you when Opportunity Presents. I have Nothing interesting either to the Public or yourself to Communicate. I was in hopes before this to have been able to inform you Congress had to some purpose considered your extraordinary Services. The Comme. apptd. for that purpose reported a reward for you, not great, but such as would have been useful to you at this Time. Congress allowed your Merrit and desert but seemed loath to make a pecuniary reward, and recommitted the report, desiring the Come. to keep it for the Present to see if something worthy for them to give & you to receive would not fall in the way.(1) Some began to think it right to Suffer you to hold the Office of Paymaster to that of Chaplain and they Agreed to raise the Chaplains pay to 40 dollars-but nothing is yet determined. I can assure you of nothing but that you have some hearty friends in Congress, and would have more were you not a Presbyterian Clergyman. If any thing arises I hope it will be Acceptable, but till it does come don't Appropriate it. Nothing is more uncertain than a dependance upon public bodies. They are moved like the wind, but rather more uncertain. I shall watch for a favourable gale.  We have a report Circulating here that the Army is about removing from N. York upon some intelligence from England. I wish it may be true but doubt it. Some think Genl. Howe is yet determined to Visit this City, but I cannot persuade myself he will venture across the Delaware when all the Militia of Pennsa are at home and ready to oppose him, & a troublesom set of People behind them. If the report of the Action in Woodbridge last Sunday week be as reported it is much in our favour, however I flatter myself the Enemy will not tarry much longer in the Jerseys. Forces are Collecting from all parts to disturb their quarters there, tho' I believe they have not a Supply of Provisions to carry them to Europe if they were disposed to go.

  My Dr Friend Phila. Friday evening March 7th 1777  I have at length heard from you, your favour of March reached me this day. Your long Silence I can readily account for when you tell me  MARCH 7, 1777  Photographic reproduction of Abraham Clark's Motion on Washington's Proclamation  of your Purchass removal &c after the repeated removals of Mrs Dayton. I once thought Mrs Dayton in danger of falling into the Enemys hands, she seemed determined to brave danger but I find She was also capable of fear, at least in her last remove to Black River. It however gives me great pleasure to hear you found them safe tho' not quite so commodiously Situated as on Golden Hill. You are now so Safely Roosted at such a distance from busy scenes I fear I shall not have the Pleasure of seeing you soon. You tell me of your Loss, but seem to think it a matter I shall not think worthy of Notice. I assure you sir I heartily feel for you & all other Sufferers in our Cause, a True Patriot is compassionate and Humane. You think you are the greatest Sufferer in the State. I saw Peter Skenck yesterday who assures me he lost at least £4,000, and many have lost their all.  You tell me you might inform me what you have been doing &c but for certain reasons refrain. You have been unfortunate in the Line of Promotion happening from certain Circumstances. Last Summer Several Promotions were made. Mr Maxwell was proposed by the Canada Commissioners as a person deserving of particular Notice. You had been placed in a obscure part of the world and Genl Schuyler had never mentioned you as having done any thing good or bad, he is alway Sparing of Praise. However, tho' I highly esteemed Mr Maxwell I did not think him altogether qualified for a Genl. and proposed you. N. York joined me, but the Delegates of Jersey Divided between you two and thereby neither Obtained it then. Towards fall I was at home Sick when Genl Maxwell was apptd. as I am told, by desire of some Jersey Delegates then present; (1) this apptment gave N Jersey two Generals Ld Stirling having been apptd. before, and this is more than our Quota. You stood in Nomination at the last promotions but we could not with any face insist upon another. I esteem Genl. Maxwell and am rejoiced to hear of his behaving well last Sunday Week at Woodbridge tho' before I find he was not greatly esteemed by a Certain General. You ask my advice with regard to yourself. Your Chance of promotion soon you may judge from what I have above related.(2) I assure you I never was fond of your entering into the Service, I most earnestly wished you employed in the Civil Line. This was prevented long ago by your averseness to it, or your timidity. We really want you more in this way than the Military, but how to effect it I cannot tell; If you should now decline the Service I fear it would place you in an unfavourable Light with the Public, and to remain Idle will neither be profitable to you or the Public, that upon the whole I cannot advise you how to Act. You enquire how Jonathan can get his Commission, this you can Obtain from Genl. Washington, he hath the Commsns. to give out and also the nomination.  I came to Philadela. last Tuesday evening. Congress Adjnd to meet here last Wednesday but a Sufficient Numr. to proceed to business have not yet come in unless they have got here this evening. Our Assembly is Sitting at Haddonfield about 7 Miles from hence. By a Letter recd. this  day from the Speaker I am desired to Attend them a few days and shall go to morrow If I can leave Delegates to represent our state in my absence, otherwise stay till I can, as I am not sure there is any but my self in Town. When I shall have an Oppertunity to visit Eliza. Town I cant say, I have not seen any of my family since Novr. and shall not I believe very soon.  Our Friend Mr Caldwells Services I am particularly Attentive to, but the wheels drag heavy, a Presbyterian Clergyman is not with some a Popular Name, and tho' I have the assurance of Congress in his favour I can promise Nothing but my best endeavours.  You say some of our Eliza Town Gentry want the Genl. to alter his Proclamation. It must render any man Unpopular to Speak in favour of those who joined the Enemy & took Protections, but I think the Genls. Proclamation a Violation of our Civil Rights and Ventured to call it in Question in Congress. My Motion was committed to a Come. who reported favourable of the Procla. but foreseeing their report would be contested they desired that the same might lie for Consideration. That I suppose was with design that it should never be called for, and I suppose never will unless I do it, for it is Notorious the Genl. directly counter Acted a Resolve of Congress of the 9th of March last, Strictly forbidding any officer to impose or require Any Oath of the Inhabitants, and he requires An Oath of Allegiance to the United States when such An Oath is absurd before our Confederation takes place, Each state requires An Oath to that Particular State, in many other instances the Proclaa. is exceptionable, and very improper, and I believe was the Production or at least set on foot by some too much in the Genl's. Good Graces. He is too much incumbered to attend to every thing, and tho' I believe him honest, I think him fallible.(3) My Paper suffers me only to Add, that I am with great regard most Affectionately yours &c, Abra.

  Gentn. Philada. March 7th. 1777 I have wrote you several letters & sent you dispatches from Congress & Committee of Correspondance by Mr. Reed who will probably be longer in reaching you than this but he goes by a much safer Conveyance as I apprehend.(1) The Congress have adjourned from Baltimore to this place again but I think rather at an improper time as it appears to me that Genl  MARCH 7, 1777  Howe is now forming another expedition against this place and I shall not think this City safe whilst the principal part of its defence depends on Militia, and altho our New Army has been recruiting a Considerable time yet we do not find them so forward as coud be wished. The want of cloathing &c keeps them back a good deal, but we are spurring them on as much as possible. I do most sincerely hope you will negotiate the Loan & send out the Articles Wanted as we might then have leisure to make remittances with greater security than we can if done precipitately. We have bought considerable quantities of produce in various parts & shall export it as fast as the times, Seasons & Enemies Ships will permit. This you may depend on, and the Produce of this Country if it coud once be exported freely will soon discharge the Debt it may be necessary to Contract.

  Dear sir. Philadelphia March 9. 1777 I had last Evening the Pleasure of yours of March 3 by your Brother.(1) to whom in his Business to this Place I shall give all the assistance in my Power. In whose favour the Ballance of Letters lies, I cant Say; but if I am in debt, in Point of Numbers it must be because Some of my Remittances have miscarried.  I am not yet entirely convinced, that We are playing a desperate Game, tho I must confess that my feelings are somewhat less Sanguine  MARCH 9, 1777  than they were last June. This diminution of Confidence is owing to Disappointment. I then expected that the Enemy would have Seen two or three Bunker Hills, between the Point of Long Island and the Banks of the Delaware River-two or three such Actions would have answered my Purpose, perhaps one alone.  I have derived Consolation however, from those Disappointments, because the People have discovered a Patience under them, greater than might have been expected. It was not very Surprising to me that our Troops Should fly in certain Situations, and abandon Lines of Such extent, at the Sudden appearance of a formidable Enemy in unexpected Places because I had learn'd from Marshall Saxe, and from others that Such Behaviour was not only common but almost constant among the best regular Troops. But there was Reason to apprehend, that the People would be Seized with such a Panick upon such a Series of ill success, that in the fright and Confusion whole States would have revolted, instead of a few paltry Individuals, whereas every State has stood firm, and even the most confused and wavering of them have gained Strength and improved in order, under all this Adversity. I therefore do not yet despair.  You Say you \""are Sensible I have not the most exalted opinion of our Generals.\"" From this Expression I Suspect, that Some busy Body has been endeavouring to do Mischief by Misrepresentation. Be this as it may, I am generally so well Satisfied in my own opinions, as to avow them.  I dont expect to see Characters either among the Statesmen or the soldiers of a young and tender State like ours equal to Some, who were bred to the Contemplation of great objects from their Childhood in older, and more powerfull Nations. Our Education, our Travel, our Experience has not been equal to the Production of such Characters, whatever our Genius may be which I have no Reason to Suspect to be less than that of any Nation under the sun.  I dont expect to see an Epaminondas to be sure, because in the opinion of Dr Swift all the ages of the World have produced but six such Characters, which makes the Chances much against our seeing any such. When such shall appear I shall certainly have an exalted opinion.  Notwithstanding this I have a sincere Esteem of our General officers taken together as a Body, and believe them upon the whole the best Men for the Purpose that America affords. I think them Gentlemen of as good sense, Education, Morals, Taste and Spirit as any we can find. and if this opinion of them is not exalted enough I am sorry for it but cannot help it. I hope however that my opinion as well as that of the World in general will be somewhat more sublimated before next winter. I do assure you that two or three Bunker Hill Battles, altho, might be as unsuccessfull as that was would do it. I lament the Inexperience of all of them and I am sure they have all Reason to lament  mine, but not to disguise my sentiments at all, there are some of them, particularly from New England that I begin to think quite unequal to the high Command they hold.  It is very true that Success generally marks the man of Wisdom, and in Some Instances Injustice is done to unsuccessfull Merit: But still it is generally true that success is a Mark of Wisdom and that Misfortunes are owing to Misconduct. The sense of Mankind has uniformly Supported this opinion and therefore I cannot but think it just. The Same Sense has uniformly attributed the ill Success of Armies to the Incapacity or other Imperfections of the General officers, a Truth which I have Sometimes presumed to Hint to some of our General officers with whom I could make so free. There Seems to be Justice in this because the Glory of Successfull wars is so uniformly attributed to them.  I shall join with you, very chearfully, in burying past Errors, and in wishing to concoct and execute the most effectual Measures to free America from her cruel oppressors.  You ask why G. Lee is denyed his Request? (2) You ask, can any Injury arise? Will it reflect any Dishonour upon Congress. I don't know that it would reflect any dishonour, nor was it refused upon that Principle. But Congress was of opinion that great Injuries would arise. It would take up too much Time to recapitulate all the Arguments which were used upon occasion of his Letter. But Congress was never more unanimous. than upon that Question. Nobody I believe would have objected against a Conference, concerning his private affairs or his particular case. But it was conceivable that a Conference should be necessary upon Such Subjects. Any Thing relative to those might have been conveyed by Letter. But it appears to be an artfull Stratagem of the two gratefull Brothers to hold up to the public View the Phantom of a Negotiation, in order to give Spirit and Courage to the Torries, to distract and divide the Whiggs, at a critical Moment when the Utmost Exertions are necessary to draw together an Army. The Words of the Count La Tour,(3) upon a similar occasion, ought to be adopted by Us. \""Remember that now there is room neither for Repentence, nor for Pardon. We must no longer reason nor deliberate. We only want Concord and Steadiness. The Lot is cast. If we prove victorious, We shall be a just, free and Sovereign People: if We are conquered, we shall be Traitors, perjured Persons and Rebels.\""  \""The Princes of the Union were not diligent enough in preparing for war. They Suffered themselves to be amused with Proposals of accommodation, they gave the League time to bring together great Forces, and after that, they could no longer brave it. They committed the fault which is very common in civil wars viz that People endeayour to save appearances. If a Party would save appearances, they must lie quiet, but if they will not lie quiet, they must push Things to an Extremity; without keeping any Measures. It rarely happens, but that otherwise they are at once both criminal and unfortunate.\"" Bailes Life of Gustavus Adolphus.(4)   But further. We see what use G[eorge III] and the two Houses make of the former Conferences with Lord How. What a Storm in England they are endeavoring to raise against us from that Circumstance.  But another Thing. We have undoubted Intelligence from Europe, that the Embassadors and other Instruments of the B. Ministry at foreign Courts made the worst Use of the former Conference. That Conference did Us a great and essential Injury at the French Court you may depend upon it. Ld. How knows it-and wishes to repeat it.  They meant farther to answer opposition in England, and to amuse foreign Nations by this Maneuvre, as well as the Whiggs in America, and I confess it is not without Indignation, that I See Such a Man as Lee suffer himself to be duped by their Policy so far as to become the Instrument of it, as Sullivan was upon a previous occasion.  Congress is under no concern about any Use that the disaffected c an make of this Refusal. They would have made the worse use of a Conference. As to any Terms of Peace, look into the Speech to both Houses, the answers of both Houses, look into the Proclamations. It is endless to enumerate Particulars which prove that the Howes have no Power but to murder or disgrace Us.  The Retaliation that is to be practiced on Lees account was determined on when I was absent, so that I can give no account of the Reasons for that Measure. Yet I have no doubt of the Right. And as to the disagreeable Consequences you mention, these I hope and presume will not take Place. If they do, they will be wholly chargeable on the Enemy. The End of Retaliation is to prevent a Repetition of the Injury. A Threat of Retaliation is to prevent an Injury, and it seldom fails of its design. In Lees Case, I am confident, it will secure him good Treatment, if Lees Confinement is not strict, that of Campbell and the Hessians ought not to be. The Intention was that they should be treated exactly as Lee is.  Our late Promotions may possibly give Disgust. But that cannot be avoided. This delicate Point of Honour, which is really one of the most putrid Corruptions of absolute Monarchy, I mean the Honour of maintaining a Rank Superiour to abler Men, I mean the Honour of preserving a single Step of Promotion to the service of the Public, must be bridled. It is incompatible with republican Principles. I hope for my own Part that Congress will elect annually all the general officers. If in Consequence of this some great Men should be obliged at the years End to go home and serve their Country in some other Capacity, not less necessary and better adapted to their Genius, I dont think the public would be ruined, perhaps it would be no Harm.  The officers of the Army, ought to consider that the Rank, the Dignity, and the Rights of whole States, are of more Importance, than this point of Honour, more indeed than the Solid Glory of any particular officer. The States insist with great Justice and Sound Policy, on having a Share of the General officers, in some Proportion to the Quotas of Troops they are to raise. This Principle has occasioned many of our late Promotions,  and it ought to Satisfy Gentlemen. But if it does not they as well as the Public must abide the Consequences of their Discontent. I shall at all Times think myself happy to hear from you, my dear sir, and to give the Utmost Attention to whatever you may suggest. I hope I shall not often trouble you to read so long a Lurry of small Talk.  ""

  My Dear Bror. No. 4 Philadelphia 9th March 1777 My last was by one of the Managers of the Lottery who its probable will be detain'd some time on the Road, by his Business.  The last letter I receiv'd from you was under the 22 Jany in which you mention the Conduct of a certain Friend of ours, which I must confess wod surprise me, had I not been previously acquainted with his disposition. I much approve of Your sentiments respecting Sinecures; as I have ever look'd on them plants of venality so I shall ever use my utmost endeavors to prevent their taking root. I shall write that Gentn my mind on this subject. You mention Masts, I make no doubt that will be a very considerable article of export both to France & Spain. I wish to be inform'd of the price they were formerly procur'd at, and what the contracters were allowed & everything respecting them as perticular as possible. In geting this information you must be very cautious not to raise a Suspicion in those you inquire of that you have any thing lucrative in view, least they counteract my schemes. I also wish you wod make inquiery what Cargos can be procur'd for Europe, whether oil, Pot, or pearl ashes or any quantities of furrs is to be had and at what price. As for Lumber the value is so trifling that no price abroad will support the expence of sending it to market, unless some articles of more value can be procur'd to make the most considerable part of the Cargo.  You mention your design to order a few Barrells flour in one of the vessels to be sent to Baltimore. I hardly think it worth your while to run the risque with a view to make a profit by it as it will cost at least 3 dollars besides the Charges. I have never yet heard who is appointed to manage the Loan office in New Hampshire nor what probability there is of pro- MARCH 10, 1777  curing money in that way, for the States. I suppose some will come in as the Interest is rais'd to 6 per Cent. I wish to be informed as often as possible what success the office meets with, also what probability there is of raising money by Tax, every measure ought to be taken by the several states to prevent depreciation. I arriv'd here the 6th inst & expect there will be members enough in town today to make a house. We have many reports of Genl. Howes preparing for some movements. It seems he has collected the Greatest part of his Strength at Brunswick. Some say he intends to visit this City. If that shod be the case, I see no great difficulty in his geting here, but if he does, he is unavoidably Ruined. I have therefore too good an opinion of his Generalship to suppose he will attempt so Hazardous an enterprise.  The inclosed letter I began at Bal[t]imore as youll see but did not recollect it till I had wrote this and as there is some thots in it not express in this I inclose unfinish'd as it is to save time,(1) for I assure you I have very little to spare, tho' that need not discourage you from writing for I can always find time to read Letters. I shod be exceeding glad to know all the proceedings of your Legislative body & hope some decisive measures will be adopted by them to free the Country of its Enemies. Your affecte Bror.

  My Dear Dear Dolly: Philadelphia 10th March 1777 My detention at the Ferry & the badness of the Roads prevented my arriving here untill Friday Evening.  I put my things into Mr. Williams' house, and went in pursuit of Lodgings. Neither Mrs. Yard nor Lucy could accommodate me. I then went to Smith's and borrowed two Blankets & returned to my own house; soon after which Mrs. Smith sent me up a very handsome supper, with a Table cloth, Knives & forks, plates, salt, a print of Butter, Tea, double refined Sugar, a Bowl of Cream, a Loaf of Bread &c &c. Here I have remain'd and shall do so waiting your arrival. Indeed Mrs. Smith oblig'd me much. I however lead a doleful lonesome life. Tho on Saturday I dined at Dr. Shippins'. He desires his Regds., he is as lonesome as I. On Saturday I sat down to dinner at the little table with Folger on a piece of Roast Beef with Potatoes. We drank your health with all our Baltimore friends. Last night Miss Lucy came to see me, & this morning while I was at Breakfast on Tea with a pewter tea-spoon, Mrs. Hard [Yard] came in She could not stay to Breakfast with me. I spend my evenings at home, snuff my candles with a pair of scissors, which Lucy seeing, sent me a pair of snuffers & dipping gravy out of the Dish with my pewter tea spoon, she sent me a large silver spoon and two silver tea spoons-that I am now quite rich.  I shall make out as well as I can, but I assure you, my Dear Soul I long to have you here & I know you will be as expeditious as you can. When I part from you again it must be a very extraordinary occasion. I have sent everywhere to get a gold or silver rattle for the child with a coral to send but cannot get one. I will have one if possible on yr coming. I have sent a sash for her & two little papers of pins for you. If you do not want them you can give them away.  MARCH 10, 1777  However unsettled things may be I could not help sending for you as I cannot live in this way. We have an abundance of lies. The current report is that General Howe is bent on coming here, another report is that the Mercht's at New York are packing their goods & putting them on board ships & that the troops are going away, neither of which do I believe. We must, however, take our chances, this you may depend on, that you will be ever the object of my utmost care & attention.  I have been exceedingly busy, since I have been here, tho' have not yet made a Congress, are waiting for the South Carolina gentleman.(1) If Capt. Hammond is arrived with any things from Boston, You will have them put in the Waggons and brought here. If she should not be arriv'd leave the Receipt with Mr. S. Purviance & desire him to receive the things and send them to me. The inclosed Letter give to Mr. Newhouse, one of the Waggoners, Send for him & let him know when you will be ready. I hope you will be able to pack up all your things quickly & have them on the way & that you will soon follow, be careful in packing and do not leave anything behind. Let Harry see that everything is safely stored in the waggons. I send Mr. McCloskey, he will be very useful. I am confident Mr. & Mrs. Hilligas will assist you, pray my best Regds. to them. I have not had time to go to their house but intend it today & shall write Mr. Hilligas by the Post. Young Mr. Hillagas got here on Saturday, he is well, he delivered me your letter & one from his father. I was exceeding glad to hear from you and hope soon to receive another Letter. I know you will set off as soon as You can. Endeavor to make good stages. You may easily lodge at Mr. Steles' at Bush the first night. It is a good house. However I must leave those matters to you as the Road must in great measure determine your Stages. I do not imagine there is any danger of small-pox on the Road. Wilmington is the most dangerous, but go on to Chester. I want to get somebody cleaver to accompany you. I hope to send one to you, but if I should not be able, you must make out as well as you can.  11 March.  I will write by the Post tomorrow. I can't add as I am now call'd on. I hope no accident will happen. Inclosed you have a few memo. as to pack'g &c which I submit to your perusal.  My best regds to Mr & Mrs. Purviance, Capt Nicholson & Lady, Mr. Luce & family & indeed all friends. My love to Miss Katy, and tell her to Ransack the house & leave nothing behind. The Waggoners will attend you at all times. Remember me to all the family. May every blessing of an Indulgent providence attend you. I most sincerely wish you a good journey & hone I shall soon, very soon, have the happiness of seeing you. With the utmost affection and Love, My Dear Dolly, I am yours forever John Hancock.  [P.S.] Doctor Bond call'd on me, Desir'd his complements. He will inoculate the child as soon as it comes.  Mrs. Washington got here on Saturday. I went to see her. She told me she Drank tea with you.  Let Harry take the Continental Horse, Saddle & Bridle, that I left at Mr. Purviance's & tell Mr. Purviance to charge his keeping in his public credit. If Capt Hardy returns the Horse I lent him with the Saddle & Bridle he must also come. Get the heavy waggon off as soon as you can, that they may be here as early as possible as we shall much want the things after you get here. I have got your bundle safe with the Petticoat, Table Cloth, I have not sent it as I thought you would not want it.

  Dear Sir Philadelphia March 11, 1777  Yours of the 7th instant, I just recd.(1) Am glad to find the Post begins to do its Duty, and that Intelligence is like to be more regular.  I doubt whether the Enemy have at Amboy and Brunswick so many as near 10,000 Men. But are they not posted in Smaller Numbers at other  MARCH 11, 1777  Places? Cannot these Places be attacked or Surprised? We must continually harrass them. As to their marching to Philadelphia, this is in an high degree improbable. If they leave Garrisons in Amboy and Brunswick, they will not have Numbers. If they evacuate those Places, Troops are coming from all Quarters. They will not attempt Philadelphia, without a large Army by Land, and a formidable Fleet in the River. They must wait for Reinforcements for this.  I assure you, We have never had a Return, since I have been last in Congress. It grieves me to hear you Still complain of the Want of Discipline. It is surely high Time to learn Wisdom. Are the officers dead to all Sense of Duty, and common Prudence? Every officer ought to be hanged, who does not discipline his Men every day.  A great General will order officers the best Skilled in military Discipline, to make his Troops perform their Exercises regularly, to make them encamp and decamp and in general to keep them inured to all the military Functions. He will frequently be present at all these Exercises, and will establish good order every where to which his Presence will contribute as much as his Capacity.  I have learned from Marshall Saxe, and universal History, as well as the fatal Experience of the last Campaign a great deal of Contempt for Forts, and much more for long Lines. Heaven grant We may not again depend upon Such Reeds. Is it not criminal to hint at any fault at Fort Washington? I am as little pleased with the commanding officer at that Fort, as I am with the Generalship that lost it, with 2600 Men in it. Why was not a General officer in it? Why was it not defended like Bunker Hill? Do officers think that these Things are to be forgotten? Or that Vengeance will always sleep? As to the two officers you mention, I wish they were converted into Select Men. Yet there is no very conspicuous Difference between them, and many others that my opticks can discern.  You promised me to keep a Journal, and send it me. It would give me great Pleasure, and much Information which I want. We have made Lincoln a Major General. I wish to know how it is liked and how he behaves. I wish We had better Materials than We have, but We must use the best We can get.  ""

  Sir Philadelphia March 11th 1777 Our adjournment from Baltimore has put all our proceedings to a stand, & our unsettled situation has prevented my writing to you as often as I  MARCH 11, 1777  Portrait of Thomas Burke  at first intended. I believe you have no cause to regret it, for I have had nothing to communicate worth your attention.  The more experience I acquire, the stronger is my conviction, that unlimited power can not be safely trusted to any man, or set of men, on earth. No men have undertaken to exercise authority with intentions more generous & disinterested than the Congress, & none seem to have fewer or more feeble motives for increasing the power of their body politic. What could induce individuals, blest with peaceable domestic affluence, to forego all the enjoyments of a pleasing home, to neglect their private affairs, & at the expence of all their time & some part of their private fortunes, to attend public business under many insurmountable difficulties & inconveniences? What but a generous zeal for the public? And what can induce such men to endeayour at increasing the power with which they are invested, when their tenure of it must be exceedingly dangerous & precarious, & can bring them individually neither pleasure nor profit? This is a question I believe can not be answered, but by a plain declaration, that Power of all Kinds has an irresistible propensity to increase a desire for itself. It gives the passion of ambition a velocity which increases on its progress; & this is a passion which grows in proportion as it is gratified. I hope Sir, you will pardon me these reflections. I know they have not escaped you. But I find my attendance in Congress, short as it has been obtrudes them on me every day. Great part of our time is consumed in debates, whose object on one side is to increase the power of Congress, & on the other to restrain it. The advocates do not always keep the same side of the contest. The same persons, who, on one day, endeayour to carry through some resolutions, whose tendency is to increase the power of Congress, are often on another day very strenuous advocates to restrain it. From this I infer that no one has entertained a concerted design to increase the power; the attempts to do it proceed from ignorance of what such a being ought to be, & from the delusive intoxication which power naturally imposes on the human mind. This latter inevitably leads to an abuse & corruption of power, & is in my humble opinion the proper object of political vigilance & jealousy. This is what will insensibly produce combinations of the States, & such combinations will be fatal to the liberties of many. It is of little moment to know what are now the subjects of political speculation. No State is in a condition to cherish projects of future ambition; but situation & comparative strength will always suggest such projects, & the powerful & conveniently situated will cherish them when they can. This will always be the case so long as man remains what his nature has determined him to be. Nor will human virtue be a sufficient security against it; on the contrary I am very suspicious that our greatest danger will arise from that source. The present is the period of public virtue & spirit: it is also the Era of inexperience. Simple nature walks almost without disguise. That profound dissimulation covered by an appearance of the most unreserved frankness, always inseparable from the  accomplished political negotiator, is unknown amongst us, & must long be unknown, because it is to be acquired only by the most assiduous application, & long attentive exercise in the habit of it. Courts are the only schools where it can be learned, & we yet have them not, & probably shall not have them very soon. Every man's soul now stands forth; & in every one you read in very legible characters, that the State he represents is more wise, virtuous, or powerful than any other, & therefore ought to dictate to the rest. Where the more palpable advantage of power is wanting, each, in his own imagination supplies the superiority in wisdom or virtue; & this, I believe, in time will be realised. For conscious strength begets a security which relaxes the more painful efforts of wisdom & virtue; while conscious weakness spurs them to their highest mettle. But, strength, Sir, irresistible strength must in the end overcome all opposition. The more powerful States by combining, can doubtless subjugate the more feeble, & opposition will but rouse them to more effectual efforts. I own, Sir, I am under no apprehensions from the New England States. Their situation & natural disadvantages will prevent their becoming formidable if uncombined with others. Their situation is remote, & in a manner detached from the other States, especially ours to the Southward, & nature has in general denied them a fertile soil. Their principal resources will always be in commerce & fisheries. This indeed will give them ships & seamen; but they can not support the one, or fit out the others, without the assistance of other States, & other States can not be excluded from fishing & navigation. Their strength may indeed be competent to internal defence, but, I believe, not to foreign conquests. I think the most formidable combination would be Massachusetts, Pennsylvania & Virginia. The first has power sufficient to overawe & consequently to direct the other three New England States. The second could equally influence Jersey & Delaware. Virginia would be formidable to her Southern neighbours, & Maryland. New York could not resist a combination of Pennsylvania and Massachusetts; Maryland must fall a sacrifice to Pennsylvania & Virginia. Against this powerful confederacy, I fear, we should not be able to hold out long; & yet North Carolina seems to me best calculated to check the ambition of Virginia. I can not help, Sir, apprehending that any resolution of Congress, wherein the three formidable above mentioned States concur, must be carried into effect, even if it tended to annihilate the Independence of other States, & divided their Territory. I have said that virtue would increase or give birth to this danger. Thus I explain myself. The virtue most cultivated will be that which will most distinguish a man in the State in which he resides. The grandeur & preeminence of that State will be the favourite passion of every man in it. A zealous love for that grandeur & preeminence, & a capacity to promote it, will be what must best distinguish & recommend any individual in it. In a word, patriotism in America must always be partial to the particular States. Patriotism to the whole will never be cherished or regarded, but as it may be con-  ducive or necessary to the other. The first will be the passion of the heart the second the idea of the understanding, & whenever our common danger is at any time removed, or even relaxed, the latter will lie dormant, while the active principle of the first will exert its greatest energy. No man can rise to eminence or distinction but through the favor of his particular State; because he must be obscure until that points him out: & no man can acquire that favor by any other means than convincing them that their wishes will always be the first object of his attention,1 not to mention that natural prejudice which every man living has in favour of his own country, & the community of which he is a member, & which the most attentive & liberal education is not able wholly to remove. In this particular all men are & ever will be national.  These & many other considerations make me earnestly wish that the power of Congress was accurately defined, & that there were adequate checks provided to prevent any excess. I am also exceedingly desirous to have particular instructions relative to some heads which I shall enclose to you, to be laid before the Assembly. One thing now embarrasses me very much. It is this. Whenever any matter wherein the authority (2) of Congress is contested is debated, it is usual to lay it over undetermined. By the rule of secrecy you know I am not at liberty to communicate any thing before it is determined, & therefore can not consult the State upon it. In these cases all our time is lost, for nothing is entered on the Journals, & nothing therefore can give testimony hereafter that such points were contested & even rejected by a majority, as is indeed the usual case.  Relative to the measures intended to be pursued by Congress, I have nothing new to add. They are endeavouring at a foreign alliance, & have some hopes of success: they will increase as much as possible their naval force, & are using every endeayour to recruit a strong army, to take the field early in the spring. Their endeavours in this respect will be ineffectual, if not earnestly seconded by the States. I have no doubt, Sir, of your particular attention to this important object. I am often suggesting to Congress that the Civil Power of the States is the best instrument for calling forth their proportion of exertions in this or any cause: but they hear with reluctance any thing that looks like the interposition of such a power in military affairs, tho' no one will venture directly to oppose or reject it. I need not repeat to you my own thoughts on this subject: you have often heard me deliver them, & I have not yet changed my opinion.  With respect to intelligence, I will enclose you the papers, & any thing not contained in them I will subjoin.  I inclose you an abstract of the debates in Congress on every question of any consequence that has been determined in Congress since my last. By these you will see what has been decided, & why. You will from them also better judge of the various opinions, or rather the fluctuations of opinion in Congress. This is an evil from which nothing but experience, & a better constitution of Congress can deliver us. My own opinions, being  those in which my country is particularly interested, I wish her to be fully informed of. To you, Sir, her principal guardian, I shall submit them with all the simplicity of unadorned truth; & where they are reprehensible I wish them to be reproved.(3) The last matter in the abstract will show you, that even thus early men so eminent as members of Congress are willing to explain away any power, that stands in the way of their particular purposes.(4) What may we not expect some time hence, when the seat of power shall become firm by habit, & men will be accustomed to obedience, & perhaps forgetful of the original principles which gave rise to it. I believe, Sir, the root of the evil is deep in human nature: its growth may be kept down, but it can not be entirely extirpated. Power will one time or other be abused, unless men are well watched, & checked by something which they can not remove, when they please.  This State is very unhappy at present; so powerful a party opposes the new Constitution, that I fear the Magistrate will not be obeyed. I am told Doctor Franklin persuaded them, by a simile, to reject a second branch of the Legislature. He said two branches would resemble a waggon with two horses at the tongue & two at the tail, who by pulling opposite ways would keep the machine still. I think the simile would have been more apt, had it represented four horses yoked to the tongue, whose business it is to assist one another in pulling on the plain, & up hill, & through all difficult places, but in going down hill the two hindmost should oppose the motion of the machine, & prevent its running too fast, to the prejudice of the horses themselves & all concerned. This simile of the Doctor's is said to have kindled the present flame. One can hardly suppress the reflection, that the people who could be so much influenced by it, were wonderfully competent to frame Constitutions !  Our expenses here, Sir, are incredible: every horse is ten shillings a day, & every thing else in proportion.(5)  ""

Cong., 2:409.  1 This resolve does not appear in the journals of Congress. The journals were not maintained daily between Congress' February 27 adjournment in Baltimore and March 12, when a quorum finally was available in Philadelphia. Since Secretary Thomson did not return to Philadelphia and resume keeping the journals until March 24, the entries for March 14-23 were kept by President Hancock and his secretary, Jacob Rush. Although the journal for March 12-13 is in Thomson's hand, he must have made these entries after the fact and on the basis of rough notes kept by Hancock and Rush, since according to his own testimony (in an April 22 letter to Washington) he was not in Philadelphia at this time. Immediately after the entry in the journal for February 27 stating that Congress was adjourning to return to Philadelphia, there is a notation by Hancock listing some orders Congress issued on March 24. Hancock must have entered these orders under the former date because they were issued in response to a report of the Board of Treasury that was delivered during Congress' recess.

  Sir, Philadelphia 11t March 1777  Mr. Hancock has delivered me your Letter to him, and desired me to Return an Answer to it, and it might be proper for me to notice to you that the Mode of Application at the Marine Board is thro the Delegate of that State from whence the Application arises. Mr. Perkins came to this City and was here informed of the Adjournment of Congress to it which prevented his going forward. When Congress left Baltimore they directed that a Sum of Money should be bro't forward but it has not yet arrived. That no delay might be suffered in your Business I obtained an order for Thirty Thousand Dollars on this Loan Office but upon Application for the Money, find it intirely Exhausted tho the Payment into it of late have been liberal, and previous orders unanswered will prevent my receiving of it there for some time-but as I think that it will not be many days before the money comes from Baltimore I shall retain Mr Perkins for the present. You may undoubtedly expect that Sum to put forward the Frigates which  MARCH 11, 1777  you and Mr Cotton have to Build. and such other future advancements as may be necessary.(1)  As to the Draught or Discription of the Frigate which you are to Build, it has of late been neglected to be sent, the Committee have left it, to the Discretion and Emulation of those employed in the several States to Rival each Other in the Perfection of Building.

  Gentlemen, Baltimore, 12th March, 1777. I wrote you the 16th, 31st January, and 18th February, addressed to the President, since which I have been honoured with his of the 13th February,(1) directing several articles to be purchased out of the Montgomery's prizes, for the use of the State, which it was not in my power to execute for the following reasons, vizt. Upon an application of Congress, setting forth that as several hundred recruits for the new battalions were daily coming into this town from the States of Virginia and Maryland, in order to reinforce Genl. Washington's army, and these being destitute of proper clothing, &c. it would be absolutely necessary that the several articles captured by the Montgomery, and suitable for the soldiery, should be applied here; and requested my assent, which I peremptorily refused. The next day it was moved in Congress that an order should issue appointing four persons to appraise all the woollens, linens, &c. suitable for the soldiery, captured by the Montgomery armed vessel. Upon the motion being read, I objected to the proceeding as partial, and gave the following reasons: that as the property was, on condemnation, vested in the State of New York, together with the captain and crew of the Montgomery, and that the latter insisted on having their property disposed of in the customary manner at public vendue; and urged the evil that might attend such a precedent, especially as I had directions from your Convention to purchase those articles, and forward them to you for the clothing your troops, when they (the Congress) well knew, that the State of New York, in its present circumstances, had no port open through which they could introduce any supplies. But, maugre all my objections, the question was put, and carried nemine con. for the motion, and four gentlemen of this town appointed appraisers.(2)  MARCH 12, 1777  The members of Congress having left this a few days afterwards, by adjournment to Philadelphia, the appraisers when met, declared themselves inadequate to the appointment, being totally unacquainted with the value of those goods; which, together with the captain and crew's opposition to that mode, produced an agreement between the parties, that all should be sold at auction, except the woollens and coarse linens, which the Congress was to take at the rates of a dollar currency for what cost one shilling sterling, for the woollens, and 4s. 6d. per yard for the coarse linens; the rest of the cargo that sold at vendue, I compute upon an average, went off at about one thousand per cent: as a specimen, yard wide Irish linen, that cost 2s. 8d. per yard sterling, sold for 24s. currency per yard; a dollar is 7s. 6d. Cordage sold at £14 5s. per cwt.  I forgot to mention that in answer to my arguments against the motion, Congress availed themselves of a letter from General Washington, advising them that the Convention at Fishkill had there stopped (as I think) thirty-six wagons laden with clothing for the army immediately under his command. He says, \""indeed I cannot blame them, knowing their distressed situation.\"" However, of this a handle was made to obviate my objections.(3)  The sale of the schooner's cargo is now completed. In short, such was the exorbitant prices which these goods sold at, that I was deterred from making a considerable purchase. Add to this the difficulty of procuring conveyances, which are all employed in transporting the Congress's stores, the member's baggage, together with that of the new battalions on their march to Head-Quarters, I have only bought a few casks of barley, some coils of cordage, and the four x cut saws, thinking they might be of service with Genl. Schuyler at Albany; and these perhaps I may be obliged to leave behind for the public, for want of conveyance.  The trial of the brigantine laden with salt, is to come on on Tuesday the 18th inst; I believe she will be acquitted by the Admiralty court, being claimed by an inhabitant of this town; if so, Capt. Rogers intends appealing to Congress, as it appears by the register and papers found on board, that she was owned in Ireland, and bound to N , which the claimants pretend was only for a cover.  Capt. Rogers has his sloop almost ready for the sea, and intends sailing as soon as the brigantine's trial is over, but informs me that himself and crew are entitled to a moiety of all captures: upon my asking him for his articles, he told me that his agreement was verbal, i.e. to be upon the same footing with armed vessels fitted out by the Congress, which were originally one-third for the captors; but that previous to his taking these two last prizes, Congress had extended it to one-half. As this is contrary to the tenor of your last letter, I shall cause the distribution of the prize money to be deferred, until I receive your further instructions on this head.(4)  Our State being still unrepresented in Congress, it was thought necessary I should remain here a few days longer to transact some business in the  marine department. In that time I shall get the sales of the prizes, &c. completed, and set off for Philadelphia; from thence transmit you the accounts. Please to furnish me with your directions in the disposal of nett proceeds; and permit me again to remind you of having our State represented in Congress; it has suffered by the omission. I am respectfully, gentln., Your very humbl. servt., F. Lewis.  MS not found; reprinted from Journals of N.Y. Prov.

  My Dear Sir Philada. Mar. 12th. 1777 Yours of January 22d did not come to hand till the 26th of February at Baltimore, after our resolve to return to this city. Here I arrived last Wednesday, and omitted writing to you by one opportunity, expecting another of greater dispatch, wherein I have been disappointed. Laugh not at this circumstantial detail. It is produced altogether as an opiate for my own sensibility. For I well recollect how much pleasure the receipt of your kind letter gave me; and I remember it to have been the first enjoyment of the kind which any one had afforded me after I left Boston. And therefore it was that I felt a guilty flutter, upon taking up my pen just now, to do what ought not to have been omitted thus long, without Reason; which I was trying to give to myself in the first lines above.  The Business, which deprived me & mine of your good Company in Boston, has robbed me also in Baltimore, at times, of my customary pillow visitor. But I have such a hope of things being now in a proper train, that sweet Sleep will resume the place which sour Care has occupied for a season. Cannon & amunition are in forwardness for Ticonderoga: and some new levies are actually arrived there. So that, if it is not already invested, we may be well prepared for a spring-attack. The lake was not frozen at our last information; nor did the small pox prevail in the garrison, tho' there was some appearance of that distemper.  The Enemy in the Jersies have been long liable to be destroyed by any considerable Army of vigor. I am not able from any regular returns to say what number we have had; and you are as good a judge as I can be as to spirit.  High expectations have been formed here of good news from Rh. Island, where there can be only a small inimical force. But a letter which I have just recd. from Providence puts an end to those expectations.  MARCH 12, 1777  It is plain that we must look for another summer's bloody work. And, tho' I cannot say it is absolutely certain that there will be forreign diversions in our favor, yet I think the appearances of such an event are many & encouraging. As to supplies of arms & cloathing-there is no doubt but we shall be well off in a few months, even to a surplus. But, we must set out with what can now be collected by industry in each state of the Union, by purchase or loan or impressment.  It is judged altogether impossible for Howe to move this way by land for want of forrage & horses: The quantity and number of which ought to be accurately ascertained, in secret modes of intelligence by our General.  Confusion to the wretches who broke in upon your intended rural scheme of life! Historians, Poets & Painters unite to direct us from noisy Capitals to country Retirements for the greatest felicity within the allotments of this habitable Planet. I had often formed wishful prospects of spending some future part of my Days as a farmer, before old age should unfit me to set an industrious example in that course of life to my dear Boys. But I was obliged like you to make a proviso for my beloved partner, \""if it should be her choice.\"" For, without an union of sentiment in such connexions, no alteration of an habitual course of living could be crowned with felicity. May the Scenes of war, rapine & murder, from which, in generous patriotic resolution, you have scorned to hide yourself, be soon at an end! And may they eventually, in contrast with the future fulfilments of your former rural plan, be productive of a vast encrease of happiness.  In Baltimore I had the satisfaction of dieting in the same family with Coll. Whipple. Here, we have taken lodgings together. This circumstance tends much to alleviate the great vexation which is the product of my mission to this part of the Continent. Our landlord is Mr. Geo. Duncan of Boston. But it is the landlady which determined me in this land of strangers. Tell my Friends and Polly Middleton's Friend that Mrs. Duncan formerly was a Ran, the pretty daughter of Parry. The marked words, simple as they appear, caused many a fat laugh for your charming wife some years ago. Though past years and the laughing irritability peculiar to them will not return, yet let us hope together for a lengthy series of more rational pleasures, calm & philosophical in our after course, thro, what the splenetic call, \""this Vale of Tears.\""  The Remnant of this Sheet will suffice to contain in words the Profession of an affectionate regard for you and your dear Hannah, which no extent of seperation from you can alter, and which is really heightened by my misfortune lately threatning to cut me off from all opportunity of asserting myself Your Friend & h. servt, James Lovell  ""

Should you make any Prizes going or coming, send them into the safest Ports, addressed to the Continental Agents where they arrive. If you carry them into the West Indies you may order perishable commodities or those suited for the Country to be sold provided the property is indisputably Prize, agreeably to the discriptions of Congress, but the Vessels and other parts of the Cargoes must come to the Continent for condemnation.  It is a Standing Instruction of this Committee to all the Navy that Prisoners be used with humanity and kindness and that you pay due attention and obedience to the printed Instructions of the Navy Board.

  Philadela. March 13th. 1777. The bearer Mr Elmer waits upon your Excellency to desire you'l propose (by a flag) to Genl Howe the exchange of some British or Tory Prisoner for John Gibbon taken by the Enemy at Mount Holly last Decemr. Whether you have any Prisoners taken by your Militia I cant  MARCH 13, 1777  say. If you have the exchange can readily be effected. Mr Elmer was about moving Congress to make the Application, but this would have been improper. They only do it in particular cases for Officers of distinction Others are Comprehended in the General Cartel. It is Customary for the Commander in Chief or other Genl officers of the respective States to Nego[t]iate Exchanges for their Militia or Inhabitants.  Mr Elmer came here but today, till which Time I have been alone and could not leave Congress to Attend the Assembly, being unwell & the weather unfavourable I did not think it prudent to go today, and I am told the assembly propose to Adjourn tomorrow, which will make a journey there unnecessary. Dr. Witherspoon went last week to Prince Town & hath not returned. Mr. Serjeant is also there, he Sent his resignation to the Assembly, but it seems they either believe he did not intend resigning or they will not accept it.

  Philadelphia March 14. 1777 Congress has been sitting several Days and proceeding upon Business. I have been in Town above a Week and have spent much of my Time, in making Inquiries after the cheapest Places in Town for Board and stabling. I have at last removed my Horses from a stable at six and six Pence a Night, to another at three dollars a Week each. So that for the future I am to pay only six dollars a Week for Hay and Oats for my Horses. Oats they must have here, for the Hay is such as our Horses cannot live upon, nor indeed their own.  I am this day to remove my Quarters, from three Pounds a Week for myself and thirty shillings for my servant, to another Place where they vouchsafe to keep me for forty seven and six Pence, and my servant for twenty shillings.(1) I shall then live at the cheapest Lay.(2) Cheap indeed!  What will become of you, I know not. How you will be able to live is past my Comprehension, but I hope the Regulation of Prices, will be of Service to you. I dont know whether I have mentioned to you in any former Letter, that I sent you a Barrell of burr flour from Baltimore, by Captn. Harden, in your Uncles Vessell. I hope she is not taken.  I wish to hear often from you. Believe the Post may be now trusted. Believe me to be more yours, and more anxious for your Welfare than any Words can express. The Government of Pensilvania is taking Root downwards, and bearing Fruit upwards, notwithstanding the Squibbs in the News Papers. They are making Treason Laws and Militia Laws, &c.  The Jersey Government is making a Militia Law too. The People of that State will be all soldiers. They are exasperated, to a great degree, at the Treatment they have received, and are panting for Revenge. The Quakers too are inflamed with Resentment. They say, that they were used worse, than any other People.  In a Time of Warr, and especially a War like this, one may see the Necessity and Utility, of the divine Prohibitions of Revenge, and the Injunctions of forgiveness of Injuries and love of Enemies, which We find in the Christian Religion. Unrestrained, in some degree by these benevolent Laws, Men would be Devils, at such a Time as this.  Prattle for me to my little Friends. Give them my best Wishes, Blessings and Prayers.  ""

  Philadelphia [March 14,] 1777 (1) There was a Debate on the Subject of Retaliation soon after the arrival of the Congress at Philadelphia, occasioned by a suggestion of General Washington that our Circumstances made it impolitic to use such Language, the Enemy have a superiority over us in Captive Officers at least six to one. That there is still subsisting an agreement for exchange which the resolutions of Congress for retaliation might violate.(2)  Some extraordinary Opinions were thrown out by Mr. Loval and Doctor Weatherspoon, tending to the Doctrine that we were bound by no such agreements no longer than we found them convenient. Several Gentlemen denied this Doctrine, but maintained that the Enemy's treatment of General Lee was an infringement on their part, and the agreement was therefore become void.  North Carolina vehemently opposed the Doctrine alledging that it violated all public Faith, and was in a word declaring to mankind that we ought never to be trusted. That it was good policy even abstracted from all moral Consideration, to keep inviolate the Faith of Nations, because on that alone was founded all compact between them, that to a young Country the reputation of Fidelity was as Essential as that of Immaculate Chastity to a Young Beauty, the Smallest blot in either must sink the Subject forever in the Estimation of mankind. That if the Cartile (which he was not informed of) was violated by the Resolutions of Congress, he was clearly of Opinion that they ought to be rescin[d]ed. The Debate now turned on the Question whether the Treatment of General Lee was an infringement. The Facts produced to prove it were the Confinement of the General under Custody of the Provost at New York, and the Evasions of General How to the Question whether he should be considered as a Prisoner of War or not. North Carolina was of Opinion this did not amount to a Direct Breach, but that a Categorical answer ought to be demanded and the Enemy informed that a refusal would be deemed a Breach, but that all farther proceeding was premature.  The Congress were of a Different Opinion, and it appeared some days afterwards that General Washington thought of it in the same manner with the Congress.(3)  ""

  Sir, Philadelphia Mh. 15th. 1777. I have the Pleasure to inform you that, beyond my Expectation, I have procured a Resolve of Congress, in favour of our State, for an Order upon the Auditor General for Two hundred thousand Dollars, upon the Loan Office for Sixty Thousand Dollars, and upon the Treasury for One hundred and forty thousand Dollars to be paid out of the new Emission order'd to be issued.(1) Before Congress left Baltimore they order'd a Million of Dollars to be deliver'd to the Auditor General Subject to Draughts from Congress.(2) The Money is on the Road, and so soon as it arrives The Order upon him will be paid and your Commissrs. dispatch'd.  I received a Letter Yesterday from Saml & Robt. Purviance dated Baltimore March 10th. 1777 inclosing a Letter to Me from your Honour, which they say they had received that Morning by Capt. Timothy Coffin who was addressed to them by our State for a Load of Flour & Bar Iron. That they should load & dispatch him as soon as possible, but from the present extreme bad Condition of the Roads it was very difficult to bring Flour or any thing else to Town, therefore Produce would come in but slowly for sometime, That you had sent a General Order on Mr Hillegas the Treasurer, for as much as would load the Vessel. Mr. Hillegas, says he can't pay it without a Warrant on the Order specifying the particular Sum. As this can't be known until the Vessell is loaded, that they shall when that is done, transmit me the Order to obtain a Warrant for the Value shipp'd and close with desiring me to give your Honor the earliest Notice of Coffin's Arrival. I do it, Sir, with great Pleasure; and shall pay them by an Order upon the Treasurer, who will continue at Baltimore some Time, for so much as the Loading &c shall amount to, to be paid out of the 140,000 Dolls. for which I have an Order upon him as before mention'd.  We have nothing remarkable. The President recd. a Letter last Evening from Col. Wayne at Ticonderoga dated the 2d March. Every thing was in Peace. He mentions how the Enemy were posted in Canada, and in doing that says that the famous, now infamous Paoli commands at One of them.(3) There are Two British Grenadiers in Town who lately deserted from the Army in the Jersey, they say that the Enemy were in Want of fresh Provisions & Forage, & that there was a red Fever among the Hessians which proved very mortal. From this and other Accounts of the Want of Forage, and from the Loss and Incapacity of their Horses for Service for Want of Food I hope and conclude that they will not be able to move from Brunswick until We shall have collected an Army sufficient to attack and demolish them. I am impatient to hear of an Attack upon Rhode Island. I hope nothing will prevent it. A successful Attack there would be of infinite Advantage to the Common Cause.

The green Grass, which begins to shew MARCH 15, 1777  itself, here, and there, revives in my longing Imagination my little Farm, and its dear Inhabitants. What Pleasures has not this vile War deprived me of? I want to wander, in my Meadows, to ramble over my Mountains, and to sit in Solitude, or with her who has all my Heart, by the side of the Brooks. These beautiful Scaenes would contribute more to my Happiness, than the sublime ones which surround me.  I begin to suspect that I have not much of the Grand in my Composition. The Pride and Pomp of War, the continual Sound of Drums and Fifes as well played, as any on the World, the Prancings and Tramplings of the Light Horse numbers of whom are paraded in the Streets every day, have no Charms for me. I long for rural and domestic scaenes, for the warbling of Birds and the Prattle of my Children.(1) Dont you think I am somewhat poetical this morning, for one of my Years, and considering the Gravity, and Insipidity of my Employment. As much as I converse with Sages and Heroes, they have very little of my Love or Admiration. I should prefer the Delights of a Garden to the Dominion of a World. I have nothing of Caesars Greatness in my soul. Power has not my Wishes in her Train. The Gods, by granting me Health, and Peace and Competence, the Society of my Family and Friends, the Perusal of my Books, and the Enjoyrnent of my Farm and Garden, would make me as happy as my Nature and State will bear.  Of that Ambition which has Power for its Object, I don't believe I have a Spark in my Heart . . . (2) There [are] other Kinds of Ambition of which I have a great deal.(3)  I am now situated, in a pleasant Part of the Town, in Walnutt Street, in the south side of it, between second and third Streets, at the House of Mr. Duncan, a Gentleman from Boston, who has a Wife and three Children. It is an agreeable Family. General Wolcott of Connecticutt, and Coll. Whipple of Portsmouth, are with me in the same House. Mr. Adams has removed to Mrs. Cheasmans, in fourth Street near the Corner of Markett Street, where he has a curious Group of Company consisting of Characters as opposite, as North and South. Ingersol, the Stamp man and Judge Adrniralty, Sherman, an old Puritan, as honest as an Angell and as (stanch as a blood Hound) firrn (as a Rock) in the Cause of American Independence, as Mount Atlass, and Coll. Thornton, as droll and funny as Tristram Shandy. Between the Fun of Thornton, the Gravity of Sherman, and the formal Toryism of Ingersol, Adams will have a curious Life of it. The Landlady too who has buried four Husbands, one Tailor, two shoemakers and Gilbert Tenant [TennentJ, and still is ready for a fifth, and well deserves him too, will add to the Entertainment. Gerry and Lovell are yet at Miss Leonards, under the Auspices of Mrs. Yard.  Mr. Hancock has taken an House in Chestnut Street, near the Corner of fourth Street near the State House.  March 17.

I am alone from the State of New York, as Mr Lewis is not yet come up, and it being of the utmost importance to that state as well as individuals thereof, for whom I have the highest esteem, I have declined risquing the event of so important an affair, untill on a full and equal Assembly the justice of it may have its proper consideration and effect.  Mr Robert Morris has very friendly, and chearfully, offered me all the Assistance and advice in his power. From the abilities and influence of this Gentleman I anticipate every success that could be wished-and doubt not you will be of the Same opinion with myself when you are informed by the members of the Convention that have attended Congress, how much the Sentiments of Mr. Morris have the influence they aim at.  Tho' justice and impartiality should be the ruling principle in every publick Assembly, yet when Interest, ambition, or any such motives interfere, such is the depravity of human Nature, that they are apt to be biased, and when a majority is to determine a question, tho the Cause may be just, there is reason to dread the event; and this is the principal reason for my delaying the bringing on this Affair.  You may depend Sir, I will be watchfull to introduce your Letter and the subject of it into Congress upon the first dawn of a favourable chance for its success, and then, as it will be supported by such powerfull influence as I have mentioned, I think I may give you an assurance, that tho' not Speedily, yet eventually, it will terminate in a manner agreeable to your wishes.

  Sir, Philada. March 17th. 1777. I have the Honour to transmit you sundry Resolves of Congress of a very important Nature, to which I beg Leave to solicit your Attention.(1)  The Congress having had your Letters of the 1st and 6th Inst.(2) under Consideration, have come to the enclosed Resolve on the Subject, by which you will perceive they decline making any Alteration in the Resolve of the 6th January,(3)and that it was not their Intention that Colo. Campbell should experience any other Hardship than such Confinement as is necessary to his Security for the End they had in View when they passed that Resolve.  The obvious Distinction made by Genl. Howe in his Treatment of Genl. Lee who is notoriously committed to the Custody of the Provost and denied his Parole, while our other Officers are admitted to it, was the Ground on which Congress proceeded when they passed that Resolve, the Intention of which was to shew, that in Proportion as Severities against him were increased, the same Treatment should be exercised on six Field Officers.  The Principle of Retaliation was early adopted by the States of America, and if adhered to, will be the most likely Way to prevent our Enemies from making Distinctions, which have no other Foundation but the Gratification of their Revenge, Gen. Lee having an undoubted Right to every Indulgence that our other Officers Prisoners among them may receive.  I have wrote the Governor and Council of Virginia, and likewise to Colo. Stephen on the Subject of the enclosed Resolves.(4)  The Congress have endeavoured to put a Stop to Foreigners coming over to America to enter the Service, not only by directing the Committee of Secret Correspondence to write to the Agents abroad to discourage them from such Views, but by declaring that they shall not be employed, unless they are well acquainted with our Language.

The expence of living here is beyond all Bounds. Everything has risen more than double since you left this. Unless some effectual stop can be put to the sinking Curr[enc]y I dont know what will be the Consequence, & how that is to be effected I cannot devise, unless by taxation. Why has not N.H. adopted this measure? She is exceedingly fond of following the example of Massachusetts & Connecticut; in some things why not in this? Which in my judgment is the wisest they ever set her.  How goes on Your recruiting service? Have any Troops marched yet for Ticonderoga, that post is of great importance to the Eastern States, therefore demands their particular attention. Some are still apprehensive of an Attack on this City, but I must confess I am not one of those, for was the Enemy to make such an attempt, or were they to succeed so far as to get possession of the City, they must be Ruined. This is so evident that I think they will not make the attempt.... Our Army is still small but increasing, and I hope will be in a condition to drive the Enemy out of N.

Your Letter is well written & quite free from bad Spelling so that I hope by pains and practice you will write a good & fair current hand. I do assure you this will be a very good Service to you & indeed would of itself at this time and place procure you a handsome Livelyhood. At the same time I have the pleasure to say that Fannys Letter is just as well spelt & rather the more neatly written of the two. I have given her my Advice which she will communicate to you & you must tell her all that follows of News.  Your Mother was well by the last Accounts which were written these few Days. I was somewhat apprehensive for her after Mrs. Smiths Death & would have brought her away but as she could not go home she chose to stay where she is. Your Brother John has been ill these 4 Weeks of the Rheumatism which has reduced him a good deal. He is here still in the house & mostly in bed but we think him out of Danger & he has been up a little this Day. He lies now by me in the Room & Sends his kind Love to you all. I hope it will please God to recover him wholly in a little time but till then it is uncertain what plan will be followed for his Employment. He will have Business as soon as he is capable of it. I saw a Letter lately from James to his Uncle & conversed with Lewis Morris this Day who left him hearty & well on Friday last. I understand he is very happy with General Maxwell who is a Man of Spirit & who has been the chief man who has directed the Skirmishes against the Enemy. I was at Princeton from Saturday Se'enight till Wednesday Morning last. Your uncle is well. Old Mr. Serjeant is dead of the small pox. Judge Stockton is not very well in health & much spoken against for his Conduct. He Signed Howes declaration & also gave his Word of honour that he would not meddle in the  MARCH 17, 1777  Portrait of Richard Stockton  least in American affairs during the War. Mrs. Cochran was sent to the Enemies Lines by a flag of Truce and when Mr. Cochran came out to meet his wife he said to the Officers that went with the flag that Judge Stockton had brought Evidence to General Howe to prove that he was on his Way to seek a protection when he was taken. This he denies to be true yet many credit it but Mr. Cochrans known quarrel with him makes it very doubtful to candid Persons.(1)  I think I wrote before of the state of my property.(2) John Graham has been a very faithful servant. He has threshed and sold above a hundred Bushels of wheat Since the Enemy fled & could he get hands would soon sell all that remains. I ordered all my books to be put up in boxes & sent to the Country lest the Enemy should come that Way again but at present we are entertaining hopes that they will not come this Way at all. There are also about 300 Bushels of my Potatoes left which I have directed to be sold. Probably I will go again to Princeton the End of this Week to see further about my affairs.  Letters are just come from Dr Franklin who arrived safely in France the 8 of December but had not been in Paris when he wrote. Things however promise very well from that Quarter.(3)  I believe I wrote you that Dick Stockton and a large party were taken by our People. Mr McDonald is come back & taken the Oaths to the State of New Jersey & behaves well.  I shall leave this Letter open till to morrow & then if possible write another to Mr Smith & add what further occurs to me. I suppose you understood by my former Letters that I have no Objection to your visiting us this Spring with your Brother & Sister and I have not a Glimmering of hope that we may get your Mother to Princeton by that time. Hitherto every body has expected the Enemy to push this Way but now it begins to be judged that their intention is to go up the North River to effect a Junction with Carlton if possible which was the last years Scheme. If so it will be a happy Circumstance for us & I hope no loss to the public. You see my Dear Boy how I look pleasurably upon your writing to me with long Letters.

But I am under Such Injunctions and Engagements to communicate nothing relative to foreign affairs that I ought not to do it: and if I was at Liberty, Such is the Risque of Letters by the Post, or any other Conveyance, that it would be imprudent. Thus much I may Say, that We have Letters from Dr Franklin and Mr Deane; both agree that every Thing is as they could wish, but the Dr had but just arrived, had not been to Paris, and therefore could know nothing of the Cabinet. The noted Dr Williamson is arrived full of encouraging Matter, but what Confidence is to be put in him, or what Dependence to be had on his Intelligence I know not.(2) Franklin, Deane & Williamson all agree in opinion that a War will take Place. The Reception that is given to our Privateers and Merchantmen, in every Part of the French Dominions is decisively encouraging. Weaks who carried the Dr, took two Prizes, Persons enough offered to purchase them, without Condemnation or Tryal, and to run the Risque of the Illegality of it. Perhaps they may be ransomed. Thus much you may depend on, that you may have any Thing that France affords, in the Way of Manufactures, Merchandize or Warlike Stores, for Sending for it. I can go no further as yet. Congress has done as much as they ought to do and more than I thought they ought to have done, before they did it.  I will hazard a prophecy for once, and it is this that there will as certainly be a general War in Europe, as there will be a Kingdom of France or Spain. How soon it will be, I wont precisely determine but I have no more doubt that it will be within a year to come than I have that it will be at all.(3)  Enclosed you have a Newspaper, which when you have read I wish you would send to the foot of Penn's Hill. I am, my Friend yours &c.  ""

  My dear Miss Scollay Philadelphia March 18 1777 Your Favor of the 11th of Feby by Mr Bromfield did not reach my hand till yesterday.(1) I admire your Fidelity to our departed Friend. discovered in your unceasing anxiety for the Education and future well being of his Children. A few Days before I left Boston in October last. I had an opportunity of conversing with one of the Mr Warrens upon the Subject. I told him what we had proposd for Miss Betsy- but there seemd to be a Difficulty in removing her from the Place where she had been invited to live, upon the Score of Friendship to her late Father. and had been treated with so much Civility and Kindness. With Respect to the youngest Son and Daughter, I mentioned my strong Desire that they might be continued under your Care; and that Means might be contrivd to have the  MARCH 18, 1777  eldest Son sent to Dummer School. I informd him that Master Moody was a Man of great Benevolence of Heart, and that his warm Affection for the Father, would be a powerful Motive with him to employ the utmost Attention in the Education of the Son. I urgd these things with as much Freedom as so delicate a Subject would admit of. He expressd his Obligation, and spoke of you in Terms of great Respect and Friendship, which inducd me to hope that the Interview would be attended with happy Effects. You know how engagd I was in a Multiplicity of Affairs during my short Stay in Boston. I wishd for opportunities of rendering more substantial Service to these Orphans, but it was not then in my Power.  While I was in Baltimore an opportunity presented of making a Proposal, which, if agreed to, would be honorary to my Friend and beneficial to his Son.(2) General Mercer having been slain in Battle, or rather barbarously murderd, a Motion was made in Congress for a Monument to be erected to his Memory, and that his youngest Son should be educated at the Expence of the Continent. I did not think my self partial in judging that the Services and Merit of General Warren considerd as a Patriot or a Soldier were not inferior to those of General Mercer, and therefore added to the Motion, that the same Honor should [be] paid to his Memory and that one of his Sons should be educated. I proposd the eldest. It was agreed that my Motion should be first enterd on the Journal, and a Committee was appointed to consider of them both. Congress soon after adjournd to this Place. The Gentlemen of the Committee are not all of them arrivd. I am perswaded it will be agreed to in the Committee, but as the Determination in the House may be uncertain, I think it best that it should not be made known abroad, till we see the Event.  Dr John Warren is now in this City. I have conversd with him. I freely offerd my opinion that the eldest Son should be sent as speedily as possible to Dummer School and the two youngest Children remain with you. He heard my opinion with great Candor and said he thought it a good Proposal, and mentiond you with great Respect. With Regard to Betsy, the same Difficulty which was started in the Conversation with his Brother, labourd in his Mind. It is indeed a Difficulty. I observd to him that she was in a critical Time of Life, and that I was well assured that the utmost Care would be taken of her in your Fathers Family. He was of the same opinion, and thought it best that the three Children should be kept together. As the Conversation passd in the Time of the sitting of Congress, I was obligd to break off sooner than I should otherwise have done, not without sanguine Hopes that these Matters will be concluded agreeable to your Mind. Such a Conclusion, I think will be most conducive to the Wellfare of the Children of my much valued absent Friend. The Doctor will leave this Place for Boston today. I have not Leisure now to write by him to my friends but expect to have an opportunity by Express in a few Days when I expect to forward this. I shall then acknowledge a Letter I lately receivd from your Father. Please to present my friendly Regards to  him and his Family, and to Mr Savage for whom I have long had a cordial Affection. Pray tell him that one of the South Carolina Gentlemen was so obliging to me as to forward his Letter to his Son with his own by a safe hand.  Our Friends will be glad to hear that we have this Day receivd a very agreeable Letter from Dr Franklin in France. The Vessel which brought the Letter was taken near the Capes of Delaware, having on board Fire Arms, Lead, Blankets &c belonging to the Continent, The Quantity of neither as yet ascertained. This is indeed a Misfortune, but we shall do very well for all.  I shall write to some of our particular Friends, upon the Subject which you have so much at Heart, and wish to be honord with the Continuance of your Letters. You must beleive me to be with great Sincerity your Friend and very humble Servant, Samuel Adams  ""

  Sir, Philada. March 18th. 1777. I have the Honour to transmit you sundry Resolves of Congress in Obedience to their Commands.  The Number of Foreigners already employd in the Army of these States is a prodigious Weight upon the Service; and the Evil is likely to encrease unless a speedy Stop can be put to it. For this Purpose, the Congress have not only determined that no Commissions should be granted to any foreign Officers, who are ignorant of the English Language, but have directed the Committee of Secret Correspondence to write to their Agents abroad to discourage Gentlemen from coming to America with Expectation of being taken into the Service, unless they are acquainted with our Language.(1)  The Sense of Congress relative to some Expressions in your Letter of the is so clearly conveyed in the enclosed Resolves, that I shall only add, it is their Expectation you will be more guarded for the future; and that you write in a Stile better adapted to their Rank & Dignity, as well as to your own Character.(2) I have the Honour to be, with every Sentiment of Esteem & Respect, Sir, your most obed Svt.

  My Dear Sir, (No. 11) Philadelphia 18th March 1777 Yours of the 18th Ulto with a copy of the same, is just come to hand.(1) My last to you was the 9th or 10th inst. The uncertainty of the post has prevented my sending by that Conveyance for some time past but it has now got in a more regular way. I have always been perticular in mentioning what Letter I have rec'd from you & Laterly have number'd mine so that you may easily discover if any miscarries. I shod also have the same satisfaction if you wod take the trouble of pursueing the same method.  I hope the Money by Mr Betten reach'd you soon after the date of your last but I find that will be but a small part of your demand.(2) However I shall do my endeavor to keep you Supplyed. It is of importance that the vessels shod be sent to Baltimore, for otherwise how will you get Iron for the 74 gun ship, besides it will be a great advantage to your place to have some Flour. I therefore hope you will be able to procure two vessels of 60 to 80 Ton each as mention'd in Some of my former letters by order of Committee. As to the Brig Morris I fear she is taken as there is no accots of her arrival. If she had a short passage to the Capes of Virginia she must have arriv'd there about the time that the Enemies ships were in Chesepeake Bay. They left that Bay about the 25-but we'll hope for the best. Perhaps she might have a long passage and if she arriv'd there since the 25 it's probable we might not have heard of her yet. I heartily wish that both may arrive for I assure you the Public very much want to make remittance to Europe. The gentn. you mention for Lieutts. for Capt. Roche I am sure are very good men but I Immagine the Committee will not appoint officers for a ship as soon as she is rais'd. Besides you'll find by some of my former letters that Capt. Roche's Carrecter is impeach'd & it's uncertain whether he will be continu'd in the command, & in case he MARCH 19, 1777  shod. be remov'd, perhaps those Gentn wod not chuse to go in the ship. Be this as it may, the berths will be keept for them till Roches affair is determin'd. You have done very well in [having] procur'd a number of masts. If they are not wanted for the Navy they may be shipt for Europe, where no doubt they will be exceptable.  Inclos'd you have the dimentions for the 74 gun ship. I suppose they will be serviceable in preparing the Timber. It is not desir'd that the building of her shod. be so Hurried as to be any disadvantage to the ship. I hope no pains will be spaired to make her as good a ship as can be Built in America. I wish the accounts of the Raliegh co'd be sent forward, I expected they wod have been here sometime ago. Please to observe there shod be a separate accot of what you pay the People.  Yesterday Letters were receiv'd from Dr. F which were dated at Nants a few days after his arrival there. He was to set out for Paris in a day or two. He was receivd with great joy & no doubt will be so receiv'd at Court for the accots. receiv'd there for some time before his arrival were all on the dark side. A demand has been of Mr. Deane by the British Court which was possitively refused by the Court of France. Very great preparations for war are making all over Europe; there does not seem to be the least doubt of a general war. The last Letters from France were the 10th Decr. Its now time to Expect later & more interesting intelligence which I hope I shall have the Pleasure of transmitting you soon. In the mean time be assured that I am with great truth your Most sincere Friend & humle Sert, Wm. Whipple  RC: ( Ronald von Klaussen, State of Florida, 1976 ) .  1 An extract of Langdon's February 18 letter to Whipple is in Morgan, Naval Documents, 7: 1226.  2 Langdon had told Whipple that he would need $65,000 for naval expenses in the near future.

  My dear Betsy Philade March 19 1777 I wrote to you by the last Post, and am resolvd to write by every Post as well as other opportunities. If I have Nothing more to say to you, I flatter my self you will be pleasd when I have it in my Power to tell you, as I now do, that I am in good Health and Spirits. I must remind you that the last Letter I receivd from you is dated the 26th of January. I am in daily Expectation of receiving another. You do not conceive with how much Satisfaction I read your Letters. I wish therefore that you would not omit writing to me by the Post if other safe Opportunities do not present.  Yesterday we receivd a very agreeable Letter from Doctor Franklin dated at Nantes (in France) the 8th of December. By this Letter, things  MARCH 19, 1777  appear in a very favorable Light to America in that Kingdom. A general War was thought to be unavoidable. The Differences between Spain & Portugal were not settled, although the British Monarch (as he tells his Parliament) had been using his Endeavors for that Purpose. The Passengers tell us it is the Determination of the Court of France to prevent the Russian Troops from coming to America, and that General Howe can expect no Reinforcement of foreign Mercenaries this year. It is however the Wisdom of America to prepare for the most formidable Attacks. I am sorry to tell you that the Vessel which brought us this Intelligence was taken near the Capes of Delaware, having Goods on board belonging to the Continent, to what Value is not yet ascertaind. We must expect Misfortunes and bear them. I make no Doubt but this Contest will end in the Establishment of American Freedom & Independence.  I lately receivd two Letters from my Son. He writes me that he is in good Health. The Affairs of the Department he is in, will soon be settled on a new Plan, when his Friends here say he shall be provided for. I have told him he must expect to derive no Advantage in point of Promotion from his Connection with me, for it is well known I have ever been averse to recommending Sons or Cousins. Yet I am far from being indifferent towards him. I feel the Affection of a Father. It gives me inexpressible Pleasure to hear him so well spoken of: I hope I am not, indeed I have no Reason to think that I am flatterd and deceivd.  In a former Letter you informd that our valueable Brother Mr Checkley was dangerously ill and his Life despaird of. I have heard Nothing of him since, although I have enquired of Persons who came from Providence. My worthy Friend Colo Henshaw you tell me, still lives, beyond the Expectation of his Physician and Friends. I did not promise my self the Pleasure of ever seeing him again in this World when I left Boston. But Mr Checkley was by many years younger, and in high Health when I visited him at Providence.  I have been told that the Law lately made in our State has been attended with ill Consequences, and that the Inhabitants of Boston were in Danger of being starvd for Want of the necessary Articles of living from the Country; but a Letter I have just receivd from a Friend upon whom I greatly rely, assures me that it is likely to answer the good Purposes intended. Pray, My Dear, let me know whether you live according to your own Wishes. I am very sollicitous concerning you. Tell my Daughter and Sister Polly that I daily think of them. Remember me to each of my Family and other Friends. I am, your affectionate, SA  [P.S.] After perusing the inclosd, you will seal and send it to Miss Scollay.(1) ""

  [March 19, 1777] Since our arrival in this City we have done very little in Congress. Until within a few days we had no Congress, & now we have but nine States: (1) the few members in town are closely engaged in committees, & what I write is done when other people are asleep. You will therefore not wonder should you find it very incorrect.  There are letters from Doctor Franklin in France of the 10th December. They represent a war in Europe as certainly imminent, & we have received a very particular mark of the favor of that Court,(2) which I am not at liberty to disclose.  You will see in the paper a Resolution recommending to the States to assess blankets for the soldiery.(3) This is absolutely necessary, because such things can not otherwise be had. In our State I hope it will be attended with no difficulty, because a great many families can spare one at least, & supply themselves again before the winter by spinning. The money should be paid in the Counties, & indeed if possible immediately on the valuation, because the price will not be worth the trouble of seeking after, & the individual might lose it. Whenever it is necessary to draw for money for this purpose, your draught on the President of the Congress will be duly honored.  Before Mr Hooper's departure it was resolved, that five hundred thousand dollars should be advanced to our state, on your warrant.(4) No such warrant has yet arrived: but some bills from the Treasurers have come to hand. I have consented to their being paid & deducted out of the above sum; because I knew that was the utmost amount of what was permitted to be drawn, by any means, on the account of our State. The treasury Board complain of these small drafts as being too troublesome, & wish you would order out the whole.  'Tis probable, Sir, the Assembly may make choice of some more able man to serve in this Department. I should be very far from deeming it an injury to me, & am certain it could be none to the State. I have resolved, very early in this dispute, to decline no service that my country require me to perform, altho' all offices are almost equally out of my way, & none are desirable to me. But if the Assembly should think proper to direct me to continue in this department, I hope I may be allowed to return to my private affairs, for a few weeks in the summer. If I have this permission, I promise, Sir, that I will not avail myself of it to the delay or prejudice of public business.(5)  ""

  My Dear Sir, Philade March 20th 1777  I am to acknowledge your Favor of the 22d of Feb. which I receivd a few days ago.(1) The Act for regulating Prices, you tell me has made a great Convulsion especially in Boston. I am exceedingly sorry to hear that Dissentions should arise in a Community, remarkeable for its publick Spirit, and which has heretofore by the united Exertions of Individuals repeatedly done essential Services in Support of the Liberties of America. Is it indeed true, my Friend, that \""Self Denial is a Virtue rarely to be seen among you\""? How great a Change in a few years! The Self Denial of the Citizens of Boston, their Patience and long Suffering under the cruel Oppression of the Port bill was astonishing both to their Friends and their Enemies. Their Firmness and Resolution in that severe Conflict, and the Chearfulness with which they endurd the Loss of all things, rather than the publick Liberty should suffer by their Submission, will be handed down to their Honour in the impartial History. God forbid that they should so soon forget their own generous Feelings for the Publick and for each other, as to set private Interest in Competition with that of the great Community. The Country and the Town, you tell me, mutually complain of each other. I well remember it was the Artifice of our common Enemies to foment such Divisions but by the social Interviews of Committees of Correspondence and other Means the Affections of the Town & Country were conciliated. Indeed this is no Time for angry Disputes. While the publick Liberty is in Danger, and every thing that is sacred is threatned, the People should, if ever, be in perfect good humour. At such a Time Citizens should not be over sollicitous concerning their seperate Interests. There should rather be an Emulation to excell each other in their Exertions for the Safety of our Country. I confess I am not sufficiently informed to make up a Judgment for myself of the Utility of the Act in every Particular. Perhaps it would have been better if those necessary Articles of Life for the Supply of which you depend upon the Southern Colonies had been put upon a Footing with other imported Articles. As the Price of Flour for Instance is not limited in these States, I cannot see how it can be fixed at a certain Rate in New England without Danger of injuring the Importer, or altogether preventing the necessary Supply of Bread. The Committees of the middle States I am told are now met, and if they should agree to regulate the Prices of their produce it may put it in the power of our Genl. Assembly MARCH 20, 1777  to fix them at such Rates as to enable the Merchants to supply the Town without Loss to themselves.  I observe what you have written concerning the Supply of the Army with your Mannufacture. Such Matters are out of my Line, but you may assure your self I shall endeavor to promote your Interest as far as it may be in my Power, for I am, your unfeigned Friend, SA  ""

  Sir Philadelphia March 20th 1777 I received Your favour of the 10th Instant by Mr Brown with a Copy of your account as settled by the Commissioners. After I Saw You at Kingsbridge I returned to Congress but tarried there but a few days. The day before I went home Congress agreed to augment the Pay of the Regimental Officers.(1) I Supposed they would consider the Pay of the Staff before they dismissed the Subject but it Seems they did not. Their principal object at that time was to establish a new Army. When I left Congress there was as full a representation of the State of Connecticut as the Assembly allowed to attend at one time. I was detained at home by Sickness some considerable time. While at home I received your letter of the 22d of October but could not give you a Satisfactory answer till I returned to Congress. I arrived at Baltimore the 2d of January when General Wolcott shewed me your Letter to the Delegates dated the 16th of Novr. with the representation you had made to the Commissioners of Congress in the Northern department. I took the earliest opportunity to move Congress on the Subject, upon which the Pay of the Staff officers was referred to the Board of War. On the 27th of January the Board reported as their opinion that Your Pay ought to be augmented to 75 Dollars per month which was agreed to by Congress. Upon which I immediately wrote to you enclosing a Copy of the resolution,(2) but I Suppose you were absent when the Letter arrived at Albany, as I understand by Mr Brown you have been at Lebanon about two months. There was also about the Same time a sum of money, I think 500,000 Dollars Sent to the Military Chest in your department.(3) The Board of War reported in favour of augmenting the Pay of your Assistants and some other staff officers which lies before Congress not acted upon.(4) I will move Congress to consider it. The Pay of your Assistants I am sensible is too low for the present times. I have had the pleasure of a personal acquaintance with Mr Pierce. I know him to be a Gentleman of Abilities & Merit, and strict Integrity. Such persons I wish may always meet with proper encouragement from the public. A Deputy Paymaster General is allowed  MARCH 21, 1777  6 rations and a Regimental Paymaster 3 by a resolution of Congress of the 10th of October last.(5)  As to what you mention of a neglect to give you information of the resolutions of Congress respecting the duties of Your Office, I am sure there has been no intention to treat you with neglect, or any disesteem of your person or services, for I believe you have executed Your office to as good Satisfaction as any officer in the public Service. The resolutions of Congress should be published monthly at least, for the information of all concerned, but Congress has not yet been able to procure it to be done. I understand by the President that he transmits to general Schuyler what respects the Northern department, expecting that he would give the needful information to others. Perhaps General Schuyler does not know but that the resolutions which respect your office had been transmited to you from Congress, which I think would be the proper way. I have sent you Copies of some resolutions in time past but know not whether they came to hand.  I must do General Wolcott the Justice to Say that his not Complying with Your request in your letter of the 16th of November sooner, was not from any disposition to treat it with neglect, for he seemed really concerned to have the matter accomplished, but he was left alone, & the Congress moved from Philadelphia to Baltimore about the time he received the letter which necessarily occasioned the delay. I Shall always take pleasure in rendering you any Service in my Power, and especially when it will promote the public good. I am Sir due regards, Your humble Servant, Roger Sherman  ""

  Sir Philadelphia March 21. 1777 I had this Morning the Pleasure of your Favour of the 7th Instant,(1) and am glad to learn that my Letter to you of the Tenth of February was conveyed Safely to your Hand, and am obliged to you for communicating the Resignation enclosed in it to the Honourable Board.  It would give me a great deal of Uneasiness if the Honourable Board should not proceed for Months to fill up the Vacancy, if I thought as you seem to suggest that they would postpone it untill they should see MARCH 21, 1777  me, because the Public must suffer in the mean Time, and the Vacancy must be filled up after all with some other Gentleman. The Resignation you saw was the Result of long and anxious Deliberations, was founded in Reasons that will not alter, and therefore there will be no Change in my Determination. The Difficulty you insinuate of finding a proper Person, is merely irnaginary. There is not a more suitable Person in the State nor belonging to it, than the very worthy Gentleman who now presides in that Court,(2) and other Gentlemen enough may be found to fill the Place which will be left open, by the Removal of him and his Honble Brothers, much more suitable to sit in that Seat than I am.  The Hopes you give me, that our Quota will be ready in a few Weeks rejoices me much. We want nothing but an Army now in the Field to answer our Purpose. I had this Morning the Pleasure of a Conversation with Major General Mifflin who assures me that he has Tents of the very best Quality, compleatly ready for an Army of 20,000 Men to take the Field, and that in three Weeks he shall have enough compleated for 10,000 more, that he has entrenching Tools enough compleated for the whole Army the whole Campaign. That he has Camp Kettles and Canteens enough, and that he has Horses, Waggons and Magazines of Forage ready. So that this Department, which was last year in so much disorder, which occasioned us such Losses of Men, Baggage and Stores is now in a good Arrangement, and promises more Comfort to the Army. We are making every Regulation in our Power in the Medical Department, and a fine Cargo of Druggs has arrived in Addition to a large Quantity before purchased by Dr Shippen. So that We comfort ourselves with Hopes that the Health of the Men will be better provided for than last year. In the Commissaries Department, I am informed that large Quantities of Meat have been Salted down, that the Men may not be obliged to live altogether upon fresh Beef as they did the last Summer, in the extreamest Heat of the Weather, which was thought to be prejudicial to their Health.  We are doing every Thing in our Power, for the Discipline and the Comfort of the Army. Nothing in this Contest has ever given me so much Pain as the Sufferings of the Soldiers in sickness, and for want of Discipline, to which indeed that sickness was in a great Measure owing.  You had good Reasons for your Expectations that We should have an hard Struggle with Great Britain.  Whoever has attended to the Policy of the British Court and Studied the Characters which composed it, from the year 1761. must have seen abundant Evidence of a fixed Design to subjugate America to the compleat domination of Parliament must have observed how Systematically they have proceeded with all their Art and all their Force. to accomplish this detestable Purpose.  Whoever was acquainted with the national History, must have been convinced how compleatly their Government was corrupted, and the   Persons concerned in it lost to all the Tyes of Honour, Virtue and Religion: Tyes which once restrained that Nation: Tyes which alone can restrain any People from robbing and plundering all whom they think in their Power.  Whoever was acquainted with America knew how unprepared she was. How unexperienced as Statesmen and Warriours. How unprovided with Warlike stores. How defenseless in fortified Places. And what is infinitely worse than all the rest, how much infected with that Selfishness, Corruption and Venality ( so unfriendly to the new Government she must assume ) which has been the Bane of G. Britain. Every such Person therefore must have expected an hard struggle. Hard as it is however, it will Succeed.

  Dear sir Philadelphia March 21. 1777 It is not easy to penetrate the Designs of the Enemy. What object they have in View, cannot certainly be determined. Philadelphia most probably and Albany. They have near Ten thousand Men in the Jersies, at Brunswick, Amboy, Bonamtown, and Piscataqua: the two last Posts are very near their main Body.  I think, but may be mistaken, that they will not hazard an attempt upon the City, or Albany, before they receive a Reinforcement. If they do, they must evacuate New Jersey, entirely, because they have not Men enough to leave Sufficient Garrisons in Brunswick and Amboy, and march to Philadelphia, or to Albany with the Remainder.  It is the opinion of our General officers, however, that they will march within a very few days from South Amboy, through the Pines towards the Delaware. They are building Boats in N. York which may serve either for the Delaware or Hudsons River, or indeed they may serve to draw their Army off from Bunswick, by Rariton River, Brunswick being about twelve Miles from the sound between N. Jersey and Staten Island.  What Reinforcements they will be able to obtain is uncertain. Is it not more probable that they will bring their Army round by water from Canada, and join General Howe, than that they will come over the Lakes? From England and Ireland, they can derive no great Reinforcement. It is not known how many they can obtain from Germany. The Russian Auxiliaries are uncertain, but if they come they will certainly MARCH 21, 1777  bring a French War with them. But in all Events I think We need not fear any considerable Reinforcement from Europe before Mid summer. The British Troops here, are not more sickly than usual: but the Hessians are sickly with Pleurisies and other Fevers.  It is certain, that if they should march to Philadelphia and gain Possession of it, they have not Men enough to maintain a Line of Posts, by which a Communication can be kept open by Land with New York. They must therefore evacuate New Jersey, which would leave their miserable Friends in that State in absolute Despair, and the Whiggs already exasperated to a great degree, would assume new vigour. Troops in the mean Time will be coming into N. Jersey from the Eastern States and into Pensilvania from the Southern: and the Militia of Philadelphia and Pensilvania will not be idle. So that they must expect to be cooped up in the City and there perhaps destroyed, before a Reinforcement shall arrive. Besides this, they will be at such a Distance from New York and Long Island that they may be under Apprehensions for those Places. .Another Thing, I think they will not choose to divide their Fleet so much. They will not attempt Philadelphia without a Force by water, as well as by Land. They must keep a large Number of their Ships at New York, to protect that and the neighbouring Islands, and many are at Newport. So that they cannot spare so many ships as will be necessary to come up the River Delaware.  These Reasons perswade me to differ from the opinion of our General officers, and to believe that no Attempt will be made upon Philadelphia before a Reinforcement comes. I wish I may not be deceived as this City by her central situation, Wealth, Artificers and several other Qualities is of much Importance to us. But if they get it, they will not find so much Advantage from it, as they expect. It will cost them most or all of their Force to keep it, which will make it a severity to other Plans. I am, my Friend yours, &c  ""

  Sir, Philadelphia March 21st 1777 I was honored with your favour of the 10th Instant by Mr. Brown. Nothing very material has occurred here since my last which your Honr had not received when Mr Brown came away. Letters have been re- MARCH 21, 1777  ceived from Dr. Franklin of the 8th & 13th of December last. He arrived the 6th of December having had a passage of thirty Days. The Vessel he sailed in took two Prizes on her passage which were carried into France but as they cant be Condemned there they will probably be ransomed. Accounts from France are that there is Some probability of a war between France & England, but there is no certainty of that matter. General Green arrived here yesterday from Head Quarters & General Gates is also in this City and plans are forming for the next Campaign. I hope our Army will Soon be recruited so as to be able to Subdue the Enemy's.  Enclosed is a copy of the resolutions of Congress on the doings of the New England Convention. No opinion was given on what respected the additional Bounty to the Soldiers.  Mr. Hillegas remains yet at Baltimore. Your Honr's Letter to him being on the Public Service Genl. Wolcott and I thought advisable to open, not knowing but that it might contain Some matter proper for the Treasury Board to Transact and that might require dispatch. I shall take care to forward it by the first Safe Conveyance. I forgot to mention in my last the affair of the Cannon which Congress requested the loan of.(1) Some Gentlemen seemed much Surprised at the prices of 70 & 80 pounds per Ton as Some had been purchased & engaged here at £40 this currency per Ton. I understand the Salisbury Cannon are not so heavy as these, therefore the difference of price is not so great as was imagined. When it was proposed to borrow them, We represented that they were wanted for the Defence of the State of Connecticut and if lent, others must be immediately provided in their Stead, therefore we conceived Congress would not think Such a requisition reasonable-but lest giving So high a price should make a bad precedent & raise the price here, it was resolved to apply to borrow them. We gave as a reason why they would not be afforded cheaper, That the Furnace was rebuilt & put in blast at a great expence for the purpose of Casting some Cannon for the use of that State, The Scarcity of wood, the high price of Coal & the distance it was Carted &c.  Your Honor mentions that Colo Dyer and Coll Williams Chuse to come to Congress together, which will require Some Agreement. I have not heard Genl Wolcott mention any thing about returning home  Soon.

  Dear sir Philadelphia March 22. 1777 Yours of the 16th I got yesterday.(1) If Howe imagines that one fourth of Pensilvania are Quakers, he is mistaken one half: for upon the most exact Inquiry, I find there is not more than one in Eight of that Denomination. If he imagines that 99 in 100 of these are his Friends, he is mistaken again, for I believe in my Conscience that a Majority of them are Friends to Nobody but themselves-and Howe will find them full as great an Incumbrance And Embarrassment to him, as We have found them to Us.  The Acquisition of Philadelphia would give Howe a temporary Ecclat, it is true, in Europe and America, but it would in the End prove his Destruction.  Beware of those, who make so free with the Epithets of \""Sordid\"" \""Selfish,\"" \""ungenerous\"" and \""ungratefull.\"" Let them look at Howe.  The other Colonies, it is true, contributed to Support the Poor of Boston. But for whose Good did Boston resign her whole Trade? For the good of all the others, as well as her own. And did not all the others go on with their Trade to their vast Profit, while Boston lost its all? If Boston had not, with a Generosity and Magnanimity, hitherto without Example or Parallel in America, resigned its Trade, and nobly Stood the Shock, Boston would have been the undisputed Mistress among the Slaves of America, and have drawn the Wealth of America to herself, and so she would now, if the States should Submit, because there is no other Place that the Crown officers of all denominations will resort to in such Numbers. There would be the most numerous Army, there the most powerful fleet, and there the whole Board of Excise, Customs, and Duties.  For whose Interest did Boston continue without Trade, and without Government, and submit to a trifling Force within herself? I remember a Petition from Boston to Congress, for Leave to cutt Gage and his Troops to Pieces, which was absolutely refused. To whom was it owing that all the rest of the Continent, besides Boston, continued their Exports Nine Months after all Imports were stopped? Whereby Millions were lost to this Continent-whereto in all human Probability this whole War is owing? I am not by this, however, justifying the Policy of Massachusetts in regulating the Prices of Goods, which laid them under the Necessity of prohibiting Exportations. But other States ought not to complain of this, because the continent is procuring supplies from N. England at one third of the Price which they give for the same Articles in other States. But they found they could not regulate the Prices of things without regulating Exportations Because Persons belonging to other states were about pur- MARCH 22, 1777  chasing every thing at the stated Prices, and then exporting them at an immense Profit.(2)  As to the Mass. getting Money, it is all a Joke. They have lost their Staple by this Quarrell, which no other State has done-the Fishery, I mean, which has destroyed their Trade. The Privateers fitted out in that State, which have made such an Ecclat, belong to Congress, and to Citizens of other states, I suppose, one half of them and Besides, this Continent could not have carried on the war without them. Their Seamen have supplied the Army with most Things. Where then is the Ingratitude?  Dont be anxious about the Union. I have been a Witness to such Peevishnesses a long time. They Spring from Envy at Bottom. They see the Superiority of the Mass. to every one of them, in every Point of View, and they cant bear the sight. But the ill humour will frett away. The Indigo, Rice, Tobacco, Wheat, Iron, the Staples of other States, are not affected by this War like the Fishery, the Mast and Lumber Trade which make almost the whole Trade of the Mass.  For whose good has the Mass. sacrificed their Trade, and Privateers too by their Embargo? A Restraint that other States have not chosen to Subject themselves to, altho it is more wanted, both for manning the Army and Navy in them, than it was in her.  I hate disputes of this sort, and I never begin them. But when Mass is attacked, I never have and never will fail to defend her, as far as Truth and Justice will warrant me and no further.  There is a narrow Spirit, in many People, which Seems to consider this Contest as the Affair of Boston and the Mass, not the affair of the Continent. All that they have to do, is to wear genteel Uniforms and Armour, to get the Character of Heroes by their Bravery, and to be thought to lay Boston and the Mass. under vast obligations. For my own Part I think the obligations mutual. But if there is a Ballance it is clearly in favour of Mass. I ever disclaimed, in the most decisive Terms, all obligations to any state or Person, and ever shall. I will never solicit Charity or Favours, as a Politician, much less acknowledge obligation to others, who are under the strongest of all.  Are there not Persons who insinuate themselves into your Army, with a Design to foment Prejudices, excite Jealousies, and raise Clamours? (3)  ""

  Sir Phila. March 22d. 1777 I wrote you by Mr. Bates, a few lines in regard to your manner of returning your Commission.(1) I was not aware of some circumstances attending your appointment, which have upon this occasion been Canvassed.  I shall not accurately enter upon a discussion of the propriety or impropriety of your resignation-but shall only, as an affectionate friend, give you this early intelligence of a number of facts, which will enable you to make a final determination in this matter.  The Commissions of several, enclosed in letters of less apparent resentment than yours, had been readily admitted for Resignation. Some very cutting resolutions had been made upon the insolent passages of the late Letters of Schuyler; especially on those parts which called for Stigmas on you or your brother. Immediately your Letter is opened, and by your friends committed, instead of the resignation being instantly accepted a favorable report was made, but overruled by a Motion to postpone the Consideration. Upon this General Gates sent in a recommendatory letter, explaining the circumstances of your Appointment. But this would not do. Congress is greatly piqued at the Style and Manner of MARCH 22, 1777  your demand, in a Case which will appear to you now, in the line of Favour, not of strict right.  You are to know that General Gates's power was in Canada, so that your appointment before his entrance there, was not strictly proper. Whether your first Commission was dated after any formal debate upon this point, I cannot say-but that and the late one were of one date, founded on your nomination in Congress, I suppose.  Every Member is entirely willing to accord you a Commission agreeable to the date you expect, but they are determined to lose even your acknowledged abilities, if they do not receive a different request from that now before them.  You were certainly unacquainted with the criticisms which may take place as to General Gates's power of appointment out of Canada. You were also unacquainted with the provocations which have been given to Congress for Attention to the Style of the Letters of their Officers prior to the Receipt of yours. General Gates is attached to you. The Congress admit your merit: and, while they are disposed to give you a Rank, which shall save you from all appearance of Demerit, they think that you yourself will judge the Commission more valuable for proceeding from a Body attentive to their own Honor.  No time will be lost by this Accident, if you determine to procure the Commission by the Method which I shall take the freedom to point out, because you may go on to act, from an absolute certainty to receive it by the first opportunity after your Letter shall arrive here.  To the Honb. John Hancock Esq &c &c Sir, Since I addressed a letter to your Honor from Providence, enclosing my Commission, I have been led to find that I was mistaken in the apprehension that my appointment to the office of Deputy Adjutant General on the 28th of June (from which time I have acted) was so much in the usual manner, as to render that Commission bearing an after date, a decisive degradation, when compared with the usual practise. But the same desire of serving my Country in the most effectual manner, which has governed all my Actions in the course of my Adjutancy, since the day of my first appointment, leads me to be anxious that I may not be under appearances of disgrace, from any Circumstance in my Commission: as this would lessen my most vigorous exertions. Therefore I entreat that your Honor would move the Honorable Congress to favor me with a Commission consonant in date to my appointment by General Gates, assuring them of my Zeal for the Service of the United States and of my highest Respect for their Body.  I am&c&c&c  I do not affect to point out a verbal exact model for you; it is the Tenor only.(2) With something similar you may be sure of an instant com-  pliance here. The delay therefore depends on yourself; I hope you will make none. I am &c &c, James Lovell  ""

I perceive that Mariana has had it bad, he Writes Very hard. I am heartily sorry for what the little Child has suffered, and Very much Want to see her. If she has by this lost some part of her Beauty, which I hope She has not, yet I well know she might spare much of it and yet retain as much as Most of her Sex possess-but I hope the small Pox will give her no uneasiness tho' it may have a little hurt her complexion. as there is No Valuable and lasting Beauty but what exists in the Mind, and if she cultivates these Excellencies she will not fail of being beloved and esteamed. May a gratefull sence of the divine Goodness be deeply impressed upon my Mind, in that God has taken this Care of you and our Children, and for the Health which I am favoured with.  I am sorry that our Assembly had not repealed or so farr altered the Law respecting Inoculation, or that People from the Principles of Self Preservation were not laid under a necessity of Violating it. The Law of Self Preservation certainly will justify Violating a Law not founded on Moral Principles but of supposed Conveniency only, but no Laws ought to Exist which are merely political when it is clearly known that they will not be observed as Laws of that Nature are supposed to be the Symtoms of the Want either of Power or Wisdom or perhaps both. I was fully Satisfied in my own mind that the same would be the Effect of limiting the Prices of the Articles of Living. In my Judgment the most despotic Government that ever existed since the Days of Nimrod could never carry such a Law into Execution, but I have done nothing to Prejudice the Scheme this Way as it was adopted by our State. Tho' I tho't it was founded upon every Principle of Impolicy. But why am I eternally dabbling in Politicks. Would to God that the Knaves and Oppressors of this World would cease their Villany, so that each one might Return to domestick Injoyment, and possess unenvied that Peace, which cannot be had in any Other Circumstances of Life. I want much to See my Family. There are some Circumstance of a publick Nature which render my Return less desirable just Now than I wish it was-besides a certain Management or (I do not know what to call it) which I have Experienced and which I well know that I am to expect, there is a certain Volatility or publick Inflamation arising from Various Causes which I believe will not be in my Power either to Moderate or give a benificial  MARCH 22, 1777  Direction to. But however I shall Return by May or June at farthest and spend (unless Otherwise called upon) the summer with you. Indeed I have no Design of continuing here thro the summer. I think by next June and perhaps much earlier, the Veiws of our publick Affairs will be much clearer than they are at present, whereby a good Opinion may be formed as to the extent and Duration of the War. Govr Trumbull Wrote a Letter which was recd. about Two days ago, saying that he had Spoke to Cols Dyer and Williams that one or both of them should attend Congress and that those Gentleman signified that they chose to come together. As this has been now signified twice lately in Gov Trumbulls Letters I beleive those Gentlemen are in good earnest, and I easily comprehend why it should be so, but as I have not, so I shall not say any Thing to them upon the Subject. They will do what they think proper, the Time has lately been when neither of them would attend.(1) I suppose they are now willing I should attend a Service which they expect will be called for in Connecticut & which I fancy they are not Very fond of, and when I do Return I will perform that Service if necessary, without any Hesitation-and I pray God that I may injoy a competent Degree of Health to carry Me thro it. I have no particular attachments to this City or Way of Life which I am in. If I can any Way serve my Country, My Family & Freinds it is a matter of great Indifferance to Me what my situation is-and I wish to have the unreserved opinion of some Freind wheither he thinks it advisable for Me to Return Home as soon as the Roads are settled or tarry here till perhaps the latter End of May or beginning of June. I have no other wish of my own than simply to do the Thing which is proper, just and honourable, and whatever that appears to be I shall do, and if I knew what was the State of my Family, Business, and Disposition or whatever else of the Colony, I can judge for the Rest.

  My Dear Sir, Philadelphia 24th March 1777 My last acknowledged the receipt of yours of 18th ulto and enclosed the dimensions of the 74 gun ship, since which have heard nothing of the brig Morris or ship Mifflin nor have I heard of the arrival of the schooner which my brother wrote me had sailed for Baltimore. Both Delaware and Chesapeake Bays are at this time clear of the enemy's ships, but a number of them are continually cruising on the coast, that I think it will be very lucky indeed, if some of those vessels do not fall into the enemy's hands.  The Betsey frigate proving leaky bore away for the West Indies and is safe arrived at Martinico and we are told by the Agent comes to a much better market than if she had arrived at Bordeaux-her cargo being in great demand there.(1) This is a lucky accident as remittance is much wanted there.  The money by Betton must have reached you before this time which I hope will last you some time. However I shall send you more as soon as the state of the Treasury will admit of it, in the meantime keep me advised of the state of the Loan Office and what probability there is of money coming in there.  All the Agents are instructed to send their accounts every three months which instructions have not been duly attended to. I hope my friend will endeavor to avoid censure on this score: the Secret Committee also expect that the accounts of every ship will be transmitted as soon as possible.  MARCH 25, 1777  Perhaps you'll say you don't know what commissions to charge. In answer thereto whatever commissions you charge, you'll be allowed the same that others are, say 5 per cent and it is really of importance that the accounts should be duly transmitted. The newspapers announce the arrival of a French fleet at South Carolina. I think it highly improbable that there should be such a fleet, but I should not be surprised to hear of the arrival of some ships with the stores there mentioned.(2) We have been in great want of arms to put in the hands of the new levies and were this day considering of means to obtain them, when in the midst of debate on that subject, news were brought us that 11,000 stand and a number of locks was that minute arrived. This is the most lucky circumstance that could have happened. This vessel is from Nantz and had a long passage. She brings no public news nor have I yet heard of any private.

  [ante March 25, 1777] (1)  The Examination of John Grannis on the Subject Matter of the Petition of several officers of the Frigate Warren agst Commodore Hopkins and Papers therein inclosed.(2)  Question. Where do you live?  Answer. In Falmouth in the County of Barnstable in the Massachusetts Bay.  Qu. Are you an Officer of the Warren Frigate, and what Officer, and how long have you been an Officer on Board said Frigate?  A. I am Capt. of Marines, have been so from the 14th June 1776, was sometime recruiting, and have been on board her from Time to Time upwards of Three Months.(3)  Q. Are you the Man who signed the Petition against Esek Hopkins Esqr. by the Name of John Grannis?  A. Yes.  Q. Do you know the other Subscribers to said Petition?  A. Yes.  Q. Are any of them Officers of the Warren, and if Officers what Offices do they sustain?  A. John Reed is Chaplain and belongs to Middleborough, and James Sellers is Second Lieut. of the Warren and of Dartmouth, both of Massachusetts-Bay, Richard Marvin is Third Lieut. and of Providence, George Stillman first Lieut. of Marines, Barnabas Lothrop Second Lieut of Marines & both of Barnstable. Samuel Shaw is a Midshipman of BridgeWater, Roger Haddock is Master of the Frigate and formerly was of New MARCH 25, 1777  York, and John Truman is Gunner and James Brewer Carpenter and both of Boston in the State aforesaid.  Q. Have you a personal Acquaintance with Essek Hopkins Esqr?  A. Yes I have had a personal Acquaintance with him since I came on board the Ship.  Q. Did you ever hear him say any Thing disrespectfull of the Congress of the United States, and what and when?  A. I have heard him at different Times since I belonged to the Frigate speak disrespectfully of the Congress, have heard him say that they were a Sett or Parcel of Men who did not understand their Business, that they were no Way calculated to do Business, that they were a Parcell of Lawyers Clerks, that if their Measures were followed the Country would be ruined and that he would not follow their Measures. I have heard him say the above in Company on Ship Board and Words to the same Effect on Shore. Sometimes the above was spoken of Congress in general, but more frequently of the marine Committee.  Q. Did you ever hear him speak disrespectfully of Congress or the Marine Committee before Prisoners?  A. No. I never was in his Company when Prisoners were present.  Q. Do you know any Thing about his Treatment of Prisoners?  A. I was on board the Frigate Providence when there [were] about Twenty Prisoners on board. They were called into the Cabin where I was and were asked by Capt Whipple (4) whether they would do Ship's Duty? They answered No. Capt. Whipple said it was his Orders from the Commodore to put them in Irons, to keep them on Two Thirds Allowance and by God he would obey the Commodore's Orders. They were sent out of the Cabin with an Officer, who returned & said he had put them in Irons. There were also some Prisoners sent on board the Frigate Warren, who were forced to do Ships Duty by Commodore Hopkins Orders, and he refused to exchange them when a Cartel was settled and other Prisoners were exchanged, but don't know that it was their Turn. The Reason he assigned for not exchanging them was that he wanted to have them inlist on board the Frigate.  Q. Do you know any Thing about a British Frigate being aground last Winter in the River or Bay leading up to Providence in the State of Rhode-Island &c and what?  A. I did not see the Diamond Frigate when She was on Shore in Jany. last.(5) I was then on board the Warren. which with the continental Fleet lay just above a Place called Fields Point. Commodore Hopkins went down the River in the Sloop Providence and sometime after he returned I heard him say that the People in Providence blamed him for not taking the Diamond, but that the Men were not to blame for they went as far as he ordered them, and would have gone further if he would have permitted them, but that he did not think safe to go nearer with that Sloop, for that the Diamond fired over her. I heard a Number of People who said   they were at Warwick Neck when the Diamond was aground there say that Commodore Hopkins was so far off the Ship that his Shot did not reach her, that the Ship lay so much on a Careen that She could not bring any of her Guns to bear upon the Sloop. And further I heard some American Seamen, who were Prisoners when the Diamond was aground, say after they were exchanged that the Ship lay so much on a Careen that She could not have hurt the Sloops People so long as they kept out of the Reach of her Small Arms. They also said that it was the Intention of the Enemy to have fired the Ship and left her if the Sloop had come near enough to have played upon her. One of the Seamen who told me the above was one Weeks and another of them was named Robinson Jones, both of Falmouth aforesaid and young Men of good general Reputation.  Q. Were the Frigates manned when you came from Providence?  A. No. There were then about One hundred Men on board the Warren, and I heard some of the Officers of the Frigate Providence say that in last December they had on board about One hundred and seventy Men, and the last of February I heard them say that so many of their Men were dead & run away that they were then not better of[f] for Men than the Warren.  Q. Commodore Hopkins is charged with being an Hindrance to the proper Manning of the Fleet. What Circumstances do you know relative to this Charge?  A. For my Part his Conduct and Conversation is such that I am not willing to be under his Command. I think him unfit for command, and from what I have heard Officers and Seamen say I believe that that is the general Sentiment of the Fleet, and his Conversation is at Times so wild and orders so unsteady that I have sometimes thought he was not in his Senses and I have heard some others say the same. And to his Conduct and Conversation it is attributed both by People on board the Fleet as well as by the Inhabitants of the State that the Fleet is not manned, and it is generally feared by People both on board the Fleet as well as ashore that his Commands would be so imprudent that the Ships would be foolishly lost, or that he would forego Opportunities of getting to Sea, or attempt it when impracticable. The Seamen belonging to the Columbus left her when their Time of Service expired, and went into the Army, and I heard some of them say that they would not inlist again into the Continental Fleet so long as Commodore Hopkins had the Command of it. The Character that Commodore Hopkins bore was a great hindrance to me in getting Recruits.(6)  Q. Had you Liberty from Commodore Hopkins or Capt. Hopkins to leave the Frigate you belong to?  A. No. I came to Philadelphia at the Request of the Officers who signed the Petition against Commodore Hopkins, and from a Zeal for the American Cause.  Q. Had you, or to your Knowledge either of the signers aforesaid ever any Difference or Dispute with Commodore Hopkins since your or their entering into the Service?  A. I never had, nor do I believe that either of them ever had.(7) I have been moved to do and say what I have done and said from a Love to Country, and I verily beleive that the other Signers of the Petition were actuated solely by the same Motives. Jno. Grannis  The Sub Committee appointed to take the Examination of John Grannis have examined him as above and report the same to the Marine Committee accordingly.(8)  ""

  My Dear Bror, No 6 Philadelphia 25th March 1777 Since my last I have been advis'd of the arrival of Capt Miller at Baltimore. Mr. Purviance also informs me that Mr. Langdon has advis'd him of the sailing of the Friends Adventure from Portsmouth. I have desir'd Mr. Purviance to ship 3 or 4 bbs flour on Board each of these vessels for my accot, also 3d. Nail Rods if any to be had at that place, but I am inclined to think they are not to be had. As to insurance it is not to be obtain'd & if it was it is by no means worth Your while to import Flour for sale so long as it continues at the extravagant price it now bears here. If you have a mind to Risque one or two of those I have order'd in each Vessel for your own use, it is at Your Election.  The news papers from the Eastward announce the arrival of a very valuable prize, among other things it seems she has a great Quantity of Pepper which is an article that Bear's a high price here, say 3 dolls. I mention this that if you are dispos'd to speculate, you may judge whether it will be worth your while.  Many vessels are expected from France belonging to private adventurers in that Kingdom, & its said a private Bank will be establish'd there for the reception of our paper Money.  Yesterday while Congress were deliberating on the means of obtaining an immediate supply of arms news was brought that a vessel was just arriv'd with 11,000 stand, besides a parcel of Gun locks. This I hope will enable us soon to have a good army in the field and if Genl. Howe shod make an attempt on this City which its said he intends, I doubt not it will be the last attempt, for tho' he shod get possession of the City his Ruin is enevitable. A report prevails here that Portsmouth Dock Yard is destroy'd, but I very much doubt the Authenticity of it. (1) It is also said that the French Frigates in the West Indies have taken several British  MARCH 26, 1777  ships by way of Reprisal for vessels taken by British ships off Martinico; however, these are only Reports. There has been nothing material lately from the Army every thing remaining much in the Scituation that they have been for some time past both sides preparing to take the field, and no doubt equally sanguine in hopes of Success which time only can determine.

  Philadelphia March 26. 1777  There are two ingenious Artificers, here, who have made a beautifull Field Piece of Bar Iron. The Barrs were not bound together with Hoops, like that which was made in Boston: But welded together, and afterwards bored out. It is very light, it is a Three Pounder and weighs no more than two hundred and twenty four Pounds. It has been tried every Way, and has stood the fullest Proof. It has been discharged Twenty Times, and upon discharging it three times successively, as fast as it could be loaded and fired, with several ounces of Powder more than the usual Quantity, it was observed not to be heated so much as other Guns of the same caliber commonly are when of Brass or cast Iron.  It is so light, that it may be transported about with the utmost ease, by a few soldiers alone without Horses, and is therefore admirably adapted for a Regimental Field Piece. The Generals Gates, Green and Mifflin, have examined it, and admire it. We are about contracting for a Number of them. They are cheaper than Brass. They carry a Ball as far and as direct. The only Objection is that they rebound too much, But this Inconvenience is easily remedied by strengthening the Carriage. The Names of the Smiths who made it, are Wheeler and Wiley. (1) ""

  Dear sir Philadelphia March 26. 1777 I am favoured wth yours of the 10th & as far as Time will permit shall reply to the several Matters therein hinted. MARCH 26, 1777  With respect to General Arnold, he is considered by Congress as a brave & deserving officer, & had it been possible to have proceeded in the Line of Succession in appointing officers would undoubtedly have been promoted. This cannot be done without giving great dissatisfaction to the States that had no officers in the army in the beginning of the War; who claim a right to their proportion, agreable to the Number of Men which they furnish for the Service, of Major & Brig. Generals. The principles of appointmt. are therefore reduced to three Heads, & a Regard will be had to each of these, \""the present rank of the Officers, their Merit, & the proportion already mentioned,\"" & upon the two first I think General Arnold will meet a timely promotion.(1)  I am informed that upon a report of the Board of War upon your Brother's Letter, Congress discovered a Resentment at the disrespectful Freedom expressed therein, & would not consent to give him a Commission of an earlier Date.(2) I think he had a Right to his Claim, but cannot altogether approve of the Stile in which he addressed the Legislative authority of the Continent. It is the fixed Determination of Congress to preserve the civil above the military, & the Authority of that will not be surrendred, should it be necessary to disband the Army in preserving the same. Your Friends will endeavour to reconcile the Matter, & if Measures should be adopted by your Brother to explain & set it right, which by revising his Letter might to him appear expedient, I think they will be able to obtain their Wishes.  Your proposals relative to a Q.M.G. cannot be attended to at present, as General Mifflin is desired to retain the office. When he can be spared, an attention will be paid to the Gentleman whom you mention.  I am glad to hear of your Success in procuring Supplies, & wish that Measures may be immediately pursued to provide Gardens for supplying the army daily with Vegetables, & also to procure large Quantities of Vinegar. Without these the Soldiery will be sickly & dispirited & the Service injured, if not ruined. Pray attend to them as Matters of the last Importance. Few Men can subsist upon Bread, Meat & Water. Your Application for Cash was immediately attended to, as the Treasury had recovered from the Inconveniences wch resulted from the adjournment to Baltimore.(3)  Your Application to Congress relative to your Salary shall be considered by the Treasury this week & reported to Congress as soon determined.(4)  I inclose You an extract from the Massachusetts Accounts of the Cost of the Fish exclusive of Truckage wch. was abt. 1/ per Quintal; the Quality of it is so reduced by age that the Board of War of Mass. may decline having any Concern therein, & it is left on my Hands; so that if the Enemy should not be fortunate enough to obtain it, there is a prospect of a miserable sale at the European Market. I am therefore of opinion that a high price will be allowed without the Charge of Truckage, but wish you to act disinterestedly in judging between the publick &   purchaser. You can receive Information from no other Quarter than the Treasury Board relative to this Matter, [as?] the State charged the Fish to the Continent & the original Vouchers are here.  6800 fire arms, & 1500 Gunlocks belonging to the Continent arrived here two Days since, & a number of Arms were imported by private Gentlemen in the same Bottom. I am informed 2 or 3000. General Gates is ordered to Tyonderoga. Mr Dean was demanded by the Court of Britain & refused by France. I am sir in Haste, yours sincerely, E Gerry  ""

I blame you not for determining either to rise at the Bar or in the Army. I wish you to rise in both.(1)  It is a critical, and delicate Thing to give Advice to our best Friends, and therefore I hope you will pay no more Attention to any that I may give you, than just to weigh it and then follow your own Inclinations.  As a Lt Coll of Artillery, you will be in the Road to Promotion, and will have an oppertunity of becoming great in the Art of War. You will not be obliged to give up your Rank or Pretensions at the Bar. This War will not last seven years-and if it should as long as that, you may shine at The Bar afterwards, as bright as if you had never been in the Army, and brighter too. A Military Character formed early in Life, and united to the Character of a Lawyer, a Statesman and Civilian, will not fail in the future Circumstances of America to make a great Man. MARCH 27, 1777  Crane is a brave Man, and in my opinion it will do you honour to get the better of certain Delicacies so far as to serve under him. As an officer of Artillery, you will naturally get acquainted with those sciences which are most Useful in War and I doubt not you will soon distinguish yourself, so as to merit Promotion.  The Branch of ordnance is most wanted in America and therefore affords the fairest oppertunity of doing good and acquiring Fame.

I will however inform those Gentn they must send you a Power & the President the same, by Powers I suppose you mean Powers of Attorney. I never received from you any Account of your proceedings respecting the Fanny nor did I know when she sailed untill this letter of the 1 7th Feby, nor am I informed to this hour either by you or the Committee of Salem what was done in the affair of the Sloop retaken from the Enemy with 70 hhds. of Tobo onboard. The Sloop Mr Hewes has advised me is returned to No Carolina but what is become of the Cargo he does not know. I have not time to look into the Copies of the letters wrote respecting her but my memory tells me the Secret Committee requested you & the Committee of Salem to settle with the owners of the Privateer that took him & then send her to Nantes or Martinico. I wish you wou'd Cause all the proceedings relative to that affair to be transmitted to the Secret Committee soon as you conveniently can. I wish you may have sent the Esther & other Vessells to Virginia as first intended; that Bay is now clear and the Cargoes ready. I have desired Benjn. Harrison junr Esqr of Berkely, Charles City County, to keep a look out for them and to direct them as they arrive where to apply for Cargoes, for we have several Factors buying Tobacco. The Tryton I MARCH 27, 1777  suppose will be sailed for Bourdeaux in Consequence of any former orders, and I am glad to see the dispatches were so soon sent off by the Schooner Lynch. The appointment of persons to Superintend the building of the 74 Gun Ship does not lye with me, these are Named generally by the Delegate that represents the State where they are to be built in the Marine Committee. I suppose you will not meet with any difficulty in passing the Loan Office Certificates now that the Interest is raised to six per Cent for I hope monyed men all over the Continent will put money into the Funds. You will find the Marine Committee have at length Issued orders for the purchase of the Mellish &c & that your determination to buy her will chime in very well with their orders. The seperation of Congress from many of their papers &c upon the late removal put things a little out of sorts and it is difficult to get the Committees properly into their gears again or to speak more properly, Members of Congress are too much harrassed & have too much business to do it as it ought to be done. The Brigt Lively I will very cheerfully accept off, and hope she will be fitted & ready by the time this reaches you, and I request you will put in a carefull, honest, sober, dilligent Master, agree with him on the Customary terms and let her be navigated in the most reasonable manner that can be. You will please to dispatch her immediately for Savannah in Georgia to address of John Wereat Esqr. Continental agent there, send in her the enclosed letter to Mr Wereat & if you can ship the Value of five hundred Pounds or thereabouts in Rum, Sugar, Wine, Porter &c laid in on reasonable terms, Consign the same to Mr Wereat for acct. of the Owners of this Brigt. Mr Wereat is to load her with a Cargo of Rice for France from whence she must return to America with Salt all which I mention that you may agree with the Captain & he with his Seamen accordingly. I think he had best agree for their going to Nantes or Bourdeaux & back to a safe Port in America. It is difficult to get money transmitted; therefore I send you herein Loan office Certificates for four thousand Dollars, Nos. as mentioned below, which you'l pass to any Credit with the Interest due at the time of transferring them.  Carter Braxton Esqr agrees to be one third interested in the Brigt's Cargo you are to send him; therefore you will charge him for 1/3d the Cost of vessell, outfit & Cargo and me for the other third. He requests you will ship a large quantity of Cotton & Wool Cards, they will sell well here, also nails of all sorts, some white sugar & mollasses but you must Insure his part & if you make the Cargo valuable Insure mine also.

I have resumed my Seat in Congress. My Reason is, that if at any Time I can be useful to my Country, I can at this. Pennsylvania is still in the greatest Confusion. Perhaps Order may at last arise from it. The very critical Situation of public Affairs is of much Advantage to the Assembly and their Friends.(1) I shall write you more fully soon; and am, my dear Sir, Yours very sincerely, James Wilson  ""

  Honorable Gentlemen Philada. March 28th. 1777  I wrote you a few lines the 7th Inst. by Monsr Coleaux & sent you the News papers to that time; by this Conveyance I send another packet of them under Cover to Mr. Delap at Bourdeaux. There are only two Members of the Committee of Correspondance here at present, the rest being absent on leave.  Genl. Howe's army in the Jerseys still remains inactive, and greatly distressed for want of Forage and Fresh provisions which they cannot obtain in any tollerable plenty as our Army are posted all round them, have removed most of the Hay, Corn & Provisions that was near Brunswick and never suffer a Foraging party of the Enemy to stir out but they attack them & altho' they come out strong enough to drive our People from their Posts very frequently, yet it has always happened the reverse, for they are constantly driven back into Brunswick with considerable loss of men, Horses, Waggons &c. Their situation is disagreable and for that & other reasons I cannot think they will be Content with it much longer, especially as desertion is become frequent amongst their best British Troops, the Grenadiers more or less of them come over to us every Week. You being at so great a distance may probably think we ought to have destroyed Mr. Howe's Army by this time, and so we undoubtedly shou'd had we had an Army to do it, but when it is considered that Genl. Washington has drove them from their Cantonements on Delaware to Brunswick & confined them there the whole winter, during which he has killed & taken between 3 & 4000 of their Men, 4 to 500 Horses, a Number of Waggons and considerable quantities of Stores, cloathing &c, kept them pent up in a place where they are III supplyed with provisions & other Necessarys which has produced desertion, discontent & sickness, it will astonish all mankind to learn that he had not MARCH 28, 1777  during that whole time one half their numbers in the Field & the greatest part of the Troops he had, consisted of raw Militia that never saw a Gun fired in anger untill opposed to this very formidable army. It is now evident to all America that if in the beginning of this Contest we had enlisted our army for a Number of Years or during the War, Genl Howe cou'd not have wintered here unless as a Prisoner, but alas our army were disbanded by the nature of their enlistments when they cou'd have been most usefull & the militia are too much their own masters to expect from them a steady adherence to the extream Fatigues of a long & hard winters Campaign. They turn out for a month or six weeks, show great Bravery whilst they stay, but curiousity once being gratifyed & some feat performed to make a good Story at home, they become impatient to return to their Familys & neither perswasion nor principle can detain them. For this reason Genl Washingtons Army since Novr last has consisted every month of fresh raw hands, a constant shifting Scene of comers & goers, you might suppose him 10 to 15 or 20 thousand Strong by the Commissarys and Quarter Masters returns but never 5000 by the Adjutant Generals for he never had so many at one time with him. These constant movements of Militia and the large Bountys & high wages given them has hurt the recruiting service exceedingly for those that would have enlisted, by turning out as militia for a short time have got more money than their pay & Bounty as soldiers wou'd amount to & they are more their own Masters. In short the Systems adopted by Congress respecting the Army were formed without experience and have not been equal to what was expected from them. They are now & for sometime have been Correcting their errors, so that I hope to see a formidable army under wise & wholesome regulations in a very short time. As the General is now drawing all the new recruits together and as his hands are strengthened with sufficient powers I have no doubt he will do business with them this summer if the numbers raised are sufficient to Face the Enemy & this I am inclined to believe will be the case. The Garrison at Ticonderago will be strong enough to dispute the passage there with Mr. Carleton and if you do but effect an European War to employ the British Navy, this Country will become Free and independant in a shorter time than cou'd have been expected. I fancy Genl & Ld Howe have it in View to attack this City, they may possibly get possession & if they do it will probably bring on their ruin, for they will then raise a Nest of Hornets that they dont expect & are taught to believe very differently.

  Sir, Philadelphia, March 28, 1777.  There is great reason to believe that a certain John Curlis of Shrewsbury in New Jersey was concerned in taking at Bristol the packet from General Washington to Congress. I was one of the Committee appointed to enquire into that matter; and in that character think it my duty to write to you upon the subject, that Mr. Curlis may be apprehended and examined.

As I gave you all the particulars of this affair that had come to my knowledge, there is no occasion to repeat them now. Only this I would observe, that it will be necessary for you to have the evidence of Bassonet's bar-keeper at Bristol. But I fear Curlis has taken such good care of himself that he will save you and us any further trouble.\"" Ibid., p. 56.

Captain Alexander is to command her. She makes a fine Appearance. I then went to the House of one Humphreys an ingenious shipwright and found him making a Model of a seventy four Gun Ship. He has nearly compleated it. You see every Part of the Ship, in its just Proportion in Miniature. After this Model the new seventy four Gun Ships are to be built, one at Portsmouth, one at Boston and one here.  MARCH 30, 1777  I then went to the Foundery of brass Cannon. It is in Front street in Southwark, nearly opposite to the Sweedes Church. This Building was formerly a China Manufactory, but is now converted into a Foundery under the direction of Mr. Biers [Byers], late of New York. Here is an Air furnace, in which they melt the Metal. There is a great deep Cavern dugg in the Ground in which they place the Mould into which they pour the melted Metal, and thus they cast the Gun in a perpendicular Position. Several brass six Pounders newly cast, were Iying there, and several old ones, to be cast over.  There is another Man, one King, who lives in Front street, at the Corner of Norris's Ally, who cast Patterara's and Howitzers.

  Dr sir Edenton 30th March 1777 You will no doubt be surprised to find that I am still in Carolina. I fully intended to have set out for the Congress in Feb'ry, but I have been so much indisposed almost ever since I left Halifax, great part of the time with the rheumatism, that I did not think it prudent to engage with a more Northern climate lest I should be laid up on the road, & be useless to the public & to my own private concerns. I am now getting much better & should have set out about this time had I not lately received some letters from Mr Morris (1) Chairman of the Secret Committee of Congress, requesting me to dispatch two vessels that are now loading here with tobacco on Continental account & bound for Nantes in old France. He says remittances are much wanted, & strongly urges the necessity of getting more vessels to go the same voyage. As I am a member of that Committee, & privy to most of their transactions, & am now already doing their business, I am almost as much in the way of my duty as if I was at Congress.(2) If I was there, much of my time would be taken Up in loading & chartering vessels. There are but few merchants in that Assembly, which makes that kind of business fall heavy on Mr Morris & myself. These circumstances I thought proper to mention to your Excellency, lest you should think me tardy. I want two vessels now for Continental service, one to go to old France, the other to Martinico. They are not to be had here on charter, & I have no power to purchase any on Continental account.

Do you write by the Post? If you do there must have been some Legerdemain. The Post comes now constantly once a Week, and brings me News Papers, but no Letters. I have ventured to write by MARCH 31, 1777  the Post, but whether my Letters are received or not, I dont know. If you distrust the Post, the Speaker or your Unkle Smith will find frequent Opportunities of conveying Letters.  I never was more desirous of hearing frequently from Home, and never before heard so seldom. We have Reports here, not very favourable to the Town of Boston. It is said that Dissipation prevails and that Toryism abounds, and is openly avowed at the Coffee Houses. I hope the Reports are false. Apostacies in Boston are more abominable than in any other Place. Toryism finds worse Quarter here. A poor fellow, detected here as a Spy, employed as he confesses by Lord Howe and Mr. Galloway to procure Pilots for Delaware River, and for other Purposes, was this day at Noon, executed on the Gallows in the Presence of an immense Crowd of Spectators. His Name was James Molesworth. He has been Mayors Clerk to three or four Mayors.  I believe you will think my Letters, very trifling. Indeed they are. I write in Trammells. Accidents have thrown so many Letters into the Hands of the Enemy, and they take such a malicious Pleasure, in exposing them, that I choose they should have nothing but Trifles from me to expose. For this Reason I never write any Thing of Consequence from Europe, from Philadelphia, from Camp, or any where else. If I could write freely I would lay open to you, the whole system of Politicks and War, and would delineate all the Characters in Either Drama, as minutely, altho I could not do it, so elegantly, as Tully did in his Letters to Atticus.

That all Europe wish us well, excepting only Portugal and Russia. That all the Ports of France and Spain, and Italy, and all the  MARCH 31, 1777  Ports in the Mediterranean, excepting Portugal, are open to our Privateers and Merchant Ships. That there is no danger of our wanting Arms, or Ammunition for the future-between Six and seven hundred Barrells of Powder having arrived in Maryland, and indeed We had plenty of Powder before. In Short, my Friend, altho We have many grievous Things to bear, and shall have more; yet there is nothing wanting but Patience. Patience and Perseverance will carry Us through this mighty Enterprise. An Enterprise that is and will be an Astonishment to vulgar Minds, all over the World, in this and in future Generations. An Enterprise however, which Faithfullness to our Ancestors, who have sett Us Examples of Resistance to Tyranny, Faithfullness to the present and future Generations, whose Freedom depends upon it laid us under every moral and religious obligation to undertake.  Our accounts from Europe are that great Preparations are making for war, and that every Thing tends to that object: but when or where, or how Hostilities will commence is yet unknown. France and Spain will act in concert and with perfect Amity. Neither will take any step without the other.  The American Ministers abroad, advise Us to exert ourselves in every Respect, as if We were to receive no Assistance from abroad. This is certainly good Advice, and if We have Wisdom enough to follow it, a Diversion by a war in Europe, will be a more effectual Relief to us. I am &c.  ""

I wish to hear of your having receivd both those Letters, especially the last for a Reason which must be obvious to you if you have seen its Contents.  We have receivd the important Intelligence from New Hampshire of the Arrival of a Vessel from France with near twelve thousand Stands of Arms and a great Quantity of Powder &c. I congratulate my Country on the occasion. By this Vessel I have a Letter from my much esteemed Friend A[rthur] L[ee].(1) I will recite to you some Passages in his Letter because I recollect with how much Pleasure you used to read those which I formerly receivd from him, and because I think the Spirit with which he writes and the Intelligence containd in his Letter, will afford Satisfaction to you and the Circle of our Friends. \""It is certain,\"" says he, \""that the Peace of Europe hangs upon a Cobweb. It is certain that, Portugal & Russia excepted, all Europe wishes us Success. The Ports of France, Spain and the Mediterranean are open to us on the Terms of Neutrality. We have already received a Benevolence in this Country, which will enable us to expedite and augment the Stores necessary for your Defence.\"" The Benevolence he refers to, is a voluntary Loan of a Sum of Money in France, without Interest, and to be paid as soon as it can conveniently be done after a Peace shall be establishd. You may now remember what I wrote to you from Baltimore in December last. I think we shall soon reap the happy Fruits of the Determinations of Congress at that time. My Friend tells me \""It is with Pleasure he revives a Correspondence which the particular Situation of Affairs has so long interrupted.\"" His Letter is dated in Paris the 21st of January. I had before written to him on the 2d of the same Month, being then fully satisfied that mine, if no ill Accident happend, would find him in that Place.(2) I then observd to him that our Country had called him to act in a more enlarged Sphere. He soon after informs me that he had \""obeyd the Call of Congress into the immediate Service of our Country.\"" What this Service is our Friends will conjecture. You may assure them that Matters merely commercial are not in the Line of his Genius. In my Letter, I remark to him that our Country is now enduring the sharp Conflict, confiding that righteous Heaven will never look with an indifferent Eye upon a Cause so mani- APRIL 1, 1777  festly just, and so interresting to Mankind. In his Letter, he tells me with the Spirit of Prediction \""When with Roman Fortitude & Magnanimity we refuse to treat with Hannibal at our Gates, he looks forward to Roman Greatness.\"" I am perswaded that these united States will never treat with any Power which will not acknowledge their Independence. The Inhabitants of Boston, who have heretofore acted so disinterrested and patriotick a Part will Surely persevere in supporting this all important Cause. America has already the Applause of the virtuous and the brave. If we are not wanting to ourselves, we may be assured of the Smiles of Heaven. However ready some of the Powers of Europe may be to aid us in this glorious Struggle, it will certainly in the End be best for us, if we can save ourselves by our own Exertions. Our Sufferings will indeed be greater if we are left to ourselves, but the more dearly we purchase our Liberties, the more we shall prize them and the longer we shall preserve them.  Yesterday an unhappy Man (3) was executed here for attempting to entice some of the Pilots to enter into the Service of Lord Howe. He was first examined by the Board of War, and afterwards tried by a Court Martial and condemned. The Pilots pretended to him that they were in earnest till the Bargain was made and he had given them the Bribe. They then seizd him and had him committed to Goal. Before his Execution the whole Proceedings of the Court were laid before Congress and the Judgment was approvd of. The Evidence against him was full and clear, but not more so than his own Confession. He said that he had been at New York about a Month before he was detected, and that Mr Galloway, a Man of Fortune & a noted Tory in this State, who last Winter went over to the Enemy, was his Adviser there. No Doubt there were others here who secretly abetted & supported him. Some ordinary Persons, I am told have disappeard since this Mans Detection.  It has been reported here these few days past that Lord Howe is gone to England, and it is thought by some to be probable upon this Circumstance that a new Proclamation has made its Appearance signd William Howe only.  I am informed that General Carleton and his Brother have been very ill used and are greatly disgusted with the British Court. That Lord George Sackvill and all the Scotch hate them, and they him.

These honest fellows secured him, & so ordered the business that not the least doubt remains of his guilt, which he found so evident that dissimulation was vain & he confessed it. He was tried by a Court-Martial as a spy, found guilty, and executed. Some of his coadjutors are still in confinement, & some principal conspirators are not yet apprehended, but we have hopes of being masters of them in a short time.  Letters from France of the 21st January bring very pleasing intelligence. Some part must not yet be communicated. Two millions of livres are in bank at Paris, ready to answer our drafts. France & Spain are exceedingly friendly to us. And twelve thousand stand of arms, twenty tons of gun powder, a quantity of woolens & sundry necessary articles are arrived at Portsmouth in New Hampshire, in a French armed vessel: many others are on their way, & expected every day. In short, Sir, our prospect begins to clear up, & nothing is wanting but some vigorous exertions this season. I am sorry I can not give you a good account of our army: our recruits come in very slowly, & I fear there is very great abuse in the recruiting department. We have at present our whole attention bent towards the ensuing campaign. We are in a pretty fair way, if recruits do not fail us. Every thing in Europe bears the appearance of a war, & I should not wonder if the flame should catch this summer. At all Events so apprehensive is England, that she will not dare to make very vigorous efforts in America. I shall not, Sir, take up any more of your time at present, but shall trouble you again when any thing interesting occurs.  I have the honor to be with the greatest respect & esteem, Your Excellency's most obdt Serv't, Thos Burke  ""

  Dear Sir Philada. April 1st. 1777 The enclosed Letters came by a French Ship to New Hampshire & were sent under Cover to me by Mr Langdon with many others. I believe they are from England and wish they may convey agreable tidings. Last Week a Brigt arrived here with 6800 Muskets & 2100 Gun Locks, another in Maryld with 633 bbls Powder, & this Ship into Portsmouth brought with her about 12,000 Muskets, 1000 bbls Powder, a number of Blankets & Cloathing. All these are for Continental Account and many others may be daily looked for. An offer was made to our Commissioners at Paris of two millions of Livers without Interest to be repaid when these United States have established their Independancy in Peace & quietness, no Security or Condition required. You may be sure they accepted the noble Bounty & 500,000 Livers are paid down the 20th Jany. 500,000 more was to be paid every three months untill compleated or sooner if our affairs require it. The Comrs. were well received & promised protection of the Court and that their propositions shou'd all be duely attended to. Great armaments & preparations for war &c. I fancy however, we must try our Strength alone for awhile longer, altho I firmly believe a general War will & must eventually take place in Europe this Summer. I wish our army was in the Field, we want nothing else to make the day our own. With great regard & esteem I am, Dr sir, Your affectionate hbl servt, Robt Morris  P.S.

  Sir Philadelphia, April 1. 1777 I received your favour of the 20th Ultimo. Am Sorry to hear that the recruiting Service goes on So Slow in Connecticut at this time when we ought to have an Army in the Field Sufficient to Subdue the Enemy. General Gates is ordered to Tycondaroga. He sets out to morrow. It is not determined what other General Officers are to be sent there. General St. Clair is talked of for one.(1) Congress has this Day passed some resolutions for regulating the payment of the army which are ordered to be published in the News Papers.(2) The Pay of the Assistant Paymasters in the Northern Department was this Day augmented to forty Dollars per month and (3) rations per Day. The Pay of the Regimental Paymasters is the Same- that was fixed last Saturday the 29th Ult.3  We have Letters from our Ambassadors at Foreign Courts as late as the 27th of January. The accounts are favourable beyond our expectation. They have been offered the loan of large Sums of money without Interest to be repaid when these States Shall be settled in Peace. It was not certainly known whether a War would Soon take place between France & Great Britain, tho' very probable.  You have doubtless heard of the late arrival of a Ship at Portsmouth with about 12000 Stand of Arms, 1000 Barrels of Gun Powder, a Quantity of Blankets & other Woollen goods-about 11000 Stand of Arms lately Arrived in this Port. I Shall move to have a further Supply of money immediately Sent to Albany.(4) I should think it advisable for you to return there as soon as your affairs will admit.

  My Dear Sir, Philadelphia 1st Apl 1777 I Heartily Congratulate you on the arrival of the French Ship at Portsmouth. I hope Your anxiety for Arms to put in the hand of Your new Levies will now vanish. I dare say you are anxious to know what accounts are receiv'd from Our Commis[sioners] at the French Court, where they are all arriv'd & are treated with all the Respect due to Gentn in their Station. Their Letter is dated the l9th [i.e. 17th] Jany at a time APRIL 1, 1777  when the most dismal accounts w as daily arriving of our retreating army, dress'd up in such colours as was most agreeable to the British Tyrant, & his minions. Notwithstanding all this, a Bank was Establish'd at Paris of 2,000,000 Livers without interest, or security, and at the same time the Credit of Britain is sunk so much that even in Holland the Sale of their Stock stop'd three days, for want of Purchasers, which was never before known. France & Spain are making the most vigorous preparations for War, the former had 30 sail of the line nearly ready for sea, the Latter was to have that number ready by the first of Apl. Britain has been so mean as to require a Guarentee of Hanover to enable her Tyrant to draw all his Troops out of that Electorate, which has render'd her much more contemptable in the Eyes of all Europe then she was before. The Prince of Hesse has given leave for raising 4000 Troops, which has caus'd an insurection in his country. France is determin'd if possible to prevent Russia from sending Troops to America. The House of Austria is firmly united with France. That restless Spirit, The King of Prussia is on the wing of inquiery. He is extreamly anxious to be inform'd of our trade & wishes to see our ships enter his Ports. In short as it is the interest so it is the wish of all the Powers of Europe (Portugal, Russia & Britain excepted) that the Independence of America shod be supported. After duely considering all these Circomstances, judge you if the Enemy can expect any considerable reinforcements very speedily, but Still it behoves us to use every Exertion to have a powerful army in the field, that we may experpate those Devils incarnated. When I think of their Brutality & worse then Barbarian Cruelties it raises my Indignation beyond discription. Sorry I am to find such Backwardness in the recruiting service throughout the States, when one noble effort wod in a very few months rid us of those Infernals.  We have many conjectures of the intentions of the Enemy, form'd from the accots. Brot. from York, by People who have made their escape from thence. Some suppose this City is their object, others think they intend to make a desent on the Eastern shore of Virginia, & Maryland, while others are of Opinion that they will still persue the original plan, of effecting a junction of their two armies. Whatever is their intention, certain I am that if we had one half of our intended Army in the field we could easily frustrate all their Schemes and destroy their army  I wish to know how Your Loan office goes on, & whether you have lay'd an additional tax, to sink some of Your money, this is a matter that I wish was seriously attended too. People surely never were nor never will be better able to pay a Tax then at this time & it is as sure that nothing can tend so much to establish the credit of the circulating money as lessening the Quantity. If proper measures are speedily taken I doubt not (with the assistance of the funds that are & will be soon establish'd in Europe) that our paper may be as stable, as Gold or Silver.   That proper measures may be immediately taken & that they may have the desir'd effect is the Sincere wish of Your very affecte. Friend & Most Hume Sert. W Whipple  P.S. The Cargo that is arriv'd at Portsmouth is part of the loan that you heard of some time ago. Very large Quantities are daily expected in different parts of the Continent.  ""

I inform'd you in my last what orders I had given respecting a few Barrels flour to be shipt for my accot but my orders did not get to hand till the Dove was full.(1) I suppose that to be the case as Messrs Purviance has not acknoledg'd the receipt. I believe nail Rods are not to be had there, Insurance is not to be had. By tomorrows post I shall order 10 bbs. flour to be shipt on board the Friends Adventure.

Mr. L will have orders by this conveyence to send another vessel to Baltimore or this place whichever is found to be most safe.(2) By her I will order a few Barrels more, in which you may be interested what part you please but I by no means think it worth while to ship any quantity for sale as the high price it bears here will not admit of a profit equal to the Risque. I hope you have the whole Commission for what ever Business you do for the Public. The last accots. from Europe are more encouraging then any we have had before, & we expect to have more frequent intelligence as many French ships as well as American are expected in many parts of the Continent. I am in no doubt we shall soon have sufficient Funds in Europe to support our paper Currency, but it is still necessary that large sums shod be rais'd by Tax. I hope your assembly will lay a large additional Tax to that already made. Certain I am that the People were never better able to pay a tax then at this time.  This goes by Capt Wentworth who intends to set out in the morning, I therefore close this, it now being towards morning & an hour or twos repose seems necessary. Your very affecte Bror, W Whipple  ""

  My Dear, Philadelphia 1 April 1777 My Two last were of the 22d and 15t Ultimo(1) both of which I hope by this Time you have received, tho' there is nothing more contained in them than what had been before repeated in former Letters, yet as I find it an agreable Amusement to Write to you (which you will easily believe by the Number of Letters I have Sent you) I shall therefore indulge myself in it. This indeed is the only Thing left me to supply in some Measure the more agreable Pleasures of converse. Your Situation being out of the common Post Road is the Reason why I hear from you so seldom tho' I fully expected a Letter by the Post which is just now in from the eastward but have recd none. I should have expected more Letters had not you and the Family lately been sick with the small Pox, and I suppose that this Circumstance was designedly concealed from me least I should suffer Anxiety on that Account. I was happy in being informed by Dr. Smith that you and the children were out of Danger on acco of that Disease, I wish to know wheither you are all restored to Health, and by what circumstance it was that Mariana had the Distemper so hard. I hope She is not much scar'd with it, but if she is she will always be Amiable while she continues to do as well as what she easily can. I Wrote a Letter to Oliver the 11 t last Month directed to him at N Haven,(2) but probably enough it did not find him there, or I think he was kept at Home till the Family had got thro with the small Pox. But wherever he is I hope he spends his time well in releiving the Wants of Others or improving his own Mind in the precious days of youth, so as to injoy those happy Fruits in the future Periods of Life, which a proper use of Time will never fail to yield. I have no more Reason to doubt of his Attention, than I have that of your Person but such Want the kind advice of Experience to guide them thro' the dangerous Paths of youth-tho such advice is often suspected to be no more than the Pevishness of Age. The other children are under your more immediate Notice, and consequently will have that Advantage which no other Situation would afford them. The Happiness of my Family being the object of my most sincere Wish, I should, as I cannot see my children have more frequently Wrote to them, had not the Variety of Business, and the uncertainty as well as want of Oppertunity too much prevented. I have not been told wheither the school has been kept up. I hope the unhappiness of the Times has not prevented an Attention to Education. As to Mr Lyman I have heard nothing from him since he Went to be inoculated, but I presume he is somewhere. I do not know why some of my Freinds have not wrote to me, they have more Leisure than I have, yet I cannot hear from them. I suspect they Regard a little Formality in these Matters, which never can consist with a free correspondence. I think that I have not recd but Two or three Letters from Litchfield for more than Two months past, but  APRIL 2, 1777  I expect by next Post to receive half a Dozn. at once. I may believe so as well as not for if none comes I shall be just where I am. By the Blessing of God I injoy Health.

  April 2 1777 Yesterdays Post brought me your kind Favour of March 8. 9. 10, with a Letter inclosed for [from] each of my Sons. But where is my Daughters Letter? That is missing. I regret the Loss of it much.  You think I dont write Politicks enough! Indeed I have a surfeit of them. But I shall give you now and then a Taste, since you have such a Goust for them.  By a Letter of 17 Jany. Dr. Franklin, Mr. Deane and Dr. Lee, met in Paris, and on 28 December had an Audience of the Count de Vergennes, Secretary of State and Minister of foreign Affairs; laid before him their Commission, with the Articles of the proposed Treaty of Commerce; were assured of the Protection of his Court, and that due Consideration should be given to what they offered. Soon after they presented a Memorial on the Situation of our States,(1) drawn up at the Ministers Request, together with the Articles of general Confederation, and the Demand for ships of War, agreable to their Instructions. Copies of all which Papers, they gave to the Count D'Aranda, the Spanish Ambassador, to be communicated to his Court.  They were promised an Answer from the French Court, as soon as they could know the Determination of Spain, with whom they design to Act with perfect Unanimity. In the mean Time they are expediting several Vessels laden with Artillery, Arms, Ammunition and Cloathing.  The Ports of France, Spain and Florence (that is Leghorne in the Mediterranean ) are open to the American Cruizers, upon the usual Terms of Neutrality.  They write for Commissions to be given to Privateers, and for more frequent and authentic Intelligence.  Great Efforts are now making by the British Ministry, to procure more Troops from Germany. The Princes in Alliance with France, have refused to lend any, or to enter into any Guarrantee of Hanover, which England has been mean enough to ask, being apprehensive for that Electorate if she should draw from it, any more of its Troops. APRIL 2, 1777  Four more Regiments (two of them to be light Horse) are raising in Hesse, where there has been an Insurrection, on Account of drafting the People: and now great sums of Money, are distributed for procuring Men. They talk of Ten thousand Men in all to be sent over this Spring.  The Hearts of the French are universally for Us, and the Cry is strong for immediate War with Britain. Indeed every Thing tends that Way, but the Court has Reasons for postponing it, a little longer. In the mean Time, Preparations are making. They have Twenty six sail of the Line manned and fit for the Sea. Spain has seventeen sail in the same State, and more are fitting with such Diligence, that they reckon to have thirty sail in each Kingdom, by April. This must have an immediate good Effect in our Favour, as it keeps the English Fleet at Bay, coops up their Seamen, of whom they will scarce find sufficient to man their next set of Transports, will probably keep Lord Howes fleet more together for a fear of a Visit, and leave Us more Sea room, to prey upon their Commerce and a freer Coast to bring in our Prizes, and supplies from abroad.  The Letter then mentions a Circumstance much to our Advantage but this is a secret.(2)  So strong is the Inclination of the Wealthy, in France to assist Us, that our Ambassadors have been offered a Loan of two Millions of Livres, without Interest, and to be repaid when the united States are settled in Peace and Prosperity. No Conditions or securities are required. They have accepted this noble Benefaction, and one half of it is paid into the Hands of their Banker. On the strength of this supply, they are now in Treaty for some strong ships.  Lee is in N.Y. confined, but otherwise treated well.  ""

We are Surprized not to find amongst these dispatches, any letter of instructions or directions respecting this Ship. We do not see any Charter party, or Agreement, nor any Copy of Such, nor in short any Rule whatever to go by. The Ship it Seems was dispatched in haste from Nantes, the Contracting parties we apprehend were in Paris and they have contrived to leave us totally in the dark as to the Nature and terms of their Agreement. We must therefore request that you will apply to the Captain, request him to produce the Charter party or a Copy of it, if any he has, the Bills of Loading he Signed for the Cargo, the instructions he has from his Owners or from our Commissioners or the Agents they employed to transact this Affair.  We only wish to know the Actual terms on which this Ship came out and the real intention of her future employment and we would choose to comply therewith. Circumstanced as we are, it is impossible to determine here what must be done with her but Should you discover that our Commissioners meant She should be loaden with Rice dispatch her to Charles Town South Carolina addressed to Messrs. Livinius Clarkson & John Dorsius directing them to load and dispatch her Agreeable to the design of our Commissioners. Should it appear that She was intended to Load Tobacco Send her into James River Virginia addressed to Mr Benjamin Harrison Junr of Berkly Charles City County. If Flour was the object she may come here, but if no Particular commodity was promised and it was only meant that this Ship Should bring out her Cargo to America and carry back from thence any Cargo we might have for her, we should not wish in this Case to risque the Ships going to any Other Port, but would Choose you Should load her with a Cargo of Masts, Spars, and such Other commodities as you can Collect on Reasonable terms and are Suited for the European Markets. The Cargo must go Consigned to the Order of the American Commissioners at the Court of Versailles and the Neat proceeds to be disposed of as they may direct. Whatever Charges arise on the Ship & the advances you make for the Captain You will  APRIL 2, 1777  transmit a fair and clear Account thereof, with the Captains acknowledgement of the receipt of them, together with the Invoice & bill of Loading for the Cargo to the Honorable Doctor Franklin, Silas Deane & Arthur Lee Esqrs.

  Sir, Philadelphia April 2d. 1777 I suppose the President has informed you what was done in Virginia relative to the purchase of Flour & Indian Corn.(1) William Aylet Esqr Deputy Commissary General (who is a very honest discreet man) is directed to purchase & store Sufficient quantities of those articles & have them ready to deliver to your order. The highest price he had given for corn when he wrote was half a Dollar per Bushel. Much depends upon your employing none but persons of strict Integrity, and great prudence & discretion in your department; otherwise the greatest Frauds & pecula- APRIL 2, 1777  tion may take place. Your Credit, and I fear the public Interest has suffered much from your employing a Gentleman in this place to purchase provisions. There are great Complaints against him that he gives very exorbitant prices & that the prices of articles have been much increased by his indiscretion. I have no personal knowledge of these things but they are publicly talked of by persons of the best Credit. Congress did not think proper to displace him because he is your Deputy and you accountable for his conduct-but the President was twice directed by Congress to inform you of the complaints.(2) Mr. Wharton is the person. Enclosed is a copy of an Advertisement Posted up by one of his Deputies. It is said that last winter Mr. Wharton made public declaration in this City that he was employed to purchased a large Quantity of Rum for the Army and the highest price would be given and that he gave like notice to the people in the Country as to the purchase of Pork & Beef & other provisions. I dont know on what terms youl employ people but sure I am it will not do to employ them to purchase on Commissions Unless you limit the prices: for the greater prices they give the more will be their profits, which is such a Temptation as an honest man would not wish to be led into.  A Gentleman at Baltimore has made proposals for supplying the army by Contract at a certain price per ration not to risque more than his own time and trouble. He has also proposed another plan by which all the provisions for the Army and those purchased for exportation either by the public or private merchants should go through the same hands, so that they may govern the prices, by not interfering one with another. A copy of both are Enclosed. I wish to have your opinion on them & whether you would be willing to undertake in either way. I am one of a Committee to whom it is referred.(3) Mr. Smith of Baltimore & Mr. Gerry are the other two. We thought it not best to do any thing upon it 'till we knew your thoughts on the Subject. I wish you would write to me whether you think either of those ways preferable to the present mode.  Our late accounts from France are favourable, tho' no treaty had been made, nor was a Declaration of War between France & Great Britain determined on when the letters came away which was the latter end of January. A War I believe is probable and perhaps not far distant Our Commissioners have been offered the loan of two million Livres without Interest to be repaid when these States are Settled in peace & safety-500.000 Livers were actually received. I wish our army could be recruited without loss of time as I think with fifteen or twenty thousand men we might now totally defeat the enemy's army. If the Men will inlist they can now be armed and clothed. I hope my Country Men have not lost their Martial Spirit & love of Liberty. I am Sir with due regards, your humble Servant,  Roger Sherman  P.S. General Schuyler about 2 months ago transmitted to Congress the copy of a letter published in Gain's New York Paper, said to be written by you to Colo. Williams, & requested that Justice might be done to his Character-but no Answer was returned. He has lately repeated his Complaints, complaining that Congress has not done him that Justice in the affair which they might & ought to have done, on which the President was desired to inform him that it was improper for Congress to interfere in Disputes between officers in the Army, but that they ought to be settled agreable to the Rules of the Army-withal administring a Gentle reproof to him for the indecent stile in which he wrote to Congress on that as well as some other Occasions.(4) I am sorry your Letter was intercepted (if you wrote such a one) though I think the authority of Gains Paper is not sufficient proof to support any charge whatever.

The States however have declared, in Answer to a fresh Remonstrance of General York,(2) that their Ports are open to all Nations, and that their Trade, to and from their own Colonies, shall be unmolested, their subjects complying with the ordinances issued by their high Mightynesses. Their Prohibition of exporting Warlike stores extends to all British subjects.  Without a very material and apparent success of the British Arms in America, a Loan would be very slowly negotiated for England in Amsterdam. Nothing hinders them now from selling out of the English Funds, but their not knowing what to do with their Money. For that Country may be called the Treasury of Europe, ancl its Stock of Specie is more or less, according to the Necessities of the different Princes in Europe.  The Credit of France has been very low of late. The Mismanagement of the Finances in the late Kings Reign: The Character of the late Comptroller General, Mr. De Olugny [i.e. deClugny], had reduced it so low, that it was impossible to borrow any Thing considerable, on perpetual Funds. By Life Rents, something might be done. Perhaps a Financier, in whose Probity the World have a Confidence, may restore their Credit. The French Stocks rise on the Appointment of Mr. Tabou- APRIL 3, 1777  reau. That it is possible for France to borrow, is certain. for at the Time when Mr. Turgot was removed, he was negotiating a Loan, and was likely to succeed, for Sixty Millions of Guilders. The Credit of Spain is extreamly good: That Kingdom may have what Money it will, and on the best Terms. The Emperors Credit is also good, not as Emperor but from his hereditary Dominions. Sweeden and Denmark have good Credit. The first the best. They have Money at four Per Cent. and it is not long since the King of Sweeden borrowed Three Millions of Guilders, at that Interest to pay off old debts at five Per Cent.-his Interest is paid punctually. Prussia has no Credit but his Treasury is full, by squeezing the last Farthing from his People, and now and then he draws a little Money from Holland, by reviving obsolete Claims. The Credit of the Empress of Russia, is very good, for she has punctually paid the Interest of Twelve Millions of Guilders, which she borrowed in her War with the Turks and has lately paid off, one Million and an half of the Principal. These are the strongest Recommendations to a mercantile People. As to America, in the present state of Affairs, it is not probable, that a Loan is practicable, but should it appear evident, that We are likely to support our Independency or should either France or Spain acknowledge it: in either of these Cases We might have Money. And when it shall be seen that We are punctual in our first Payments of the Interest, We should have as much as We pleased.  ""

  Sir, Philadelphia 3d April 1777 I have done myself the Pleasure of addressing three Letters to you since I left home all of which I trust you have recd.(1) As I know that you wish to be informed of whatever respects the great Cause in which We are engaged, I shall think myself happy in giving you all the Intelligence which with Propriety I may. Dr. Franklin's Arrival at Paris where he has been kindly recd. you have been acquainted with. France and Spain have by this Time forty ships of the Line fit for Sea and every Thing in those Kingdoms portend a War with G. Britain, which possibly may have already commenced. The call of the French Nation is for a War, and the opulent of that Kingdom have unsolicited Engaged to Advance to  APRIL 3, 1777  America Two millions of Livres one Quarter of which they have already paid, the Residue to be paid at Short periods, half a million cash Payment, which America is to repay without Interest after Peace shall be established in this country. The French Court have ordered Ten Thousand of their Troops to Brest. The British Court have applyed to and obtained of the Prince of Hesse six Battalions more but this affair has occasioned Insults and Insurrections in that Principality. No Russians will be sent to America, and the utmost Force which G Britain will probably be able to send to this country the next campaign will not exceed Ten Thousand men.  The above Facts are well authenticated tho they will not be published in any News Paper which you will please to consider, tho' any other Information may consistent with a Regard to that circumstance be given. We also learn tho not thro' the same Channel that the British Stocks are low in Holland that even for three Days immediately preceeding the arrival of the news that the Enemy had got possession of N. York no Transferr of Stocks was made tho many offered to sell, and those who appeared most desirous of selling were such as were supposed to be best acquainted with the Expectations of the British Court.  The Situation of the Enemy is much the same as it has been for some time past. Howe is probably meditating a Blow as he thinks no Time ought to be lost. We ought to think so to and have our Recruits brot forward as soon as possible. A few months Vigorous and successfull Exertion would probably put an End to the Distresses which We have suffered. America ought not to let the British Army have lain so long a time in the Jerseys nor suffer such Losses as we have done from small partys. Two Days ago a man was hang'd here who had come from N York and had endeavoured to hire Pilots to bring the British Fleet up the River. The Enemy have been constructing light Boat at N York seventy of which are finished and We have pritty good Intelligence that they have three Thousand of their Troops on Board, but Where their Operations may be Time must discover. Genl. Gates is to command at Ticonderoga. Commodore Hopkins is suspend.(2) Other Intelligence you will receive by the Papers.  We do not know in what circumstances the Frigate Trumbull is, I hear she is ready for Sea and will go out soon, our Naval Strength must not be Idle, they might be of immense service in intercepting Supplys and succours for the Army.

You would then have been convinced, that no such report had ever reached the Ears of the Treasury Committee, that the Cause of the Instruction (of which they were the Judges) had made it necessary, & that your Duty as a Commanding officer required your assistance in having it complied with.  But admitting it was issued by the Board in Consequence of their crediting a Report as before suggested, We again ask, did they more in this affair than their office authorized, & required of them? By recurring to the Instructions of the office in the printed Journals of Congress,(2) which surely You ought to be acquainted with, You will find \""that all persons intrusted with public Monies, shall, within a reasonable Time after being called upon for that purpose, by the Committee of the Treasury, produce their Accounts, & Vouchers at the Treasury office, in Order to their being setled & adjusted in the Manner therein directed,\"" & \""that the Committee shall be authorized to apply to the Commanding officer & others in the Continental service, for such Materials & Information as the Committee may judge to be useful for stating, explaining, or checking the public accounts, in Order to their being fairly & justly settled,\"" from whence it is evident, that the Measure adopted by the Committee was nothing more than they were authorized & required to do, without being  APRIL 4, 1777 7  under the unfavourable Impressions which you mention. Would they not then, under such Impressions have hazarded their own Reputation, by not proceeding further in the Affair than sending an Instruction to their Commissioners? Yea, ought they not in addition to this, to have immediately layed the matter before Congress, that the subject of so high a Charge by an impartial Enquiry, might have been honorably acquitted or received his Demerits?  On the Whole, We think You will be convinced on cool Reflection, that in this affair You have been mistaken in your Conjecture, hasty in your Measures, illiberal & even indecent in your Resentments, & altogether unjustifiable in your Conduct towards the Treasury.(3) We cannot but think We have a Right to expect better Treatment from your Department, &, altho We wish to harmonize with every officer civil & military of the United States, We assure You Sir, that nothing will ever induce Us to betray the public Trust, or to submit to Indignities whether offered in a public or private Capacity.

He has since suffered the Punishment due to his Crime. From his repeated Confession, it appears that Mr. Galloway was extremely active in engaging him to undertake this infamous Business, and was the Person employed to make the Bargain with him. He says indeed, Lord Howe was APRIL 4, 1777  present: but from the Description he gave of his Person, it is supposed he must be mistaken.(3)  The Congress have directed Genl. Gates to take Genl. Fermoy with him to Ticonderoga, and such other French Officers as he may think proper. Genl. St. Clair being ordered to Ticonderoga, but previously to repair to this City to wait the further Order of Congress, you will please to direct him to repair here accordingly as soon as possible.(4) I have the Honour to be, with the most perfect Esteem & Respect, Sir, Your most obed. & very hble Serv.

  Philadelphia April 6. 1777 You have had many Rumours, propagated among you, which I suppose you know not how to account for. One was, that Congress, the last Summer, had tied the Hands of General Washington, and would not let him fight, particularly on the White Plains. This Report was totally  APRIL 6, 1777  groundless. Another was, that at last Congress untied the General, and then he instantly fought and conquered at Trenton. This also was without foundation, for as his Hands were never tied, so they were not untied. Indeed, within a few days past a Question has been asked Congress, to the Surprize I believe of every Member there, whether the General was bound by the Advice of a Council of War? No Member of Congress, that I know of ever harboured or conceived such a Thought. \""Taking the Advice of a Council of War\"" are the Words of the Generals Instructions, but this meant only that Councils of War, should be called and their Opinions and Reasons demanded, but the General like all other Commanders of Armies, was to pursue his own Judgment after all.(1)  Another Report, which has been industriously circulated, is, that the General has been made by Congress, Dictator. But this is as false as the other Stories. Congress it is true, upon removing to Baltimore, gave the General Power, to raise fifteen Battallions, in Addition to those which were ordered to be raised before, and to appoint the Officers, and also to raise three thousand Horse, and to appoint their Officers, and also to take Necessaries for his Army, at an appraised Value. But no more. Congress never thought of making him Dictator, or giving him a Sovereignty.  I wish I could find a Correspondent, who was idle enough to attend to every Report and write it to me. Such false News, uncontradicted, does more or less Harm. Such a Collection of Lyes, would be a Curiosity for Posterity.  The Report you mentioned in your last,(2) that the British Administration had proposed to Congress, a Treaty and Terms, is false and without a Colour. On the Contrary, it is now more than ever past a doubt, that their fixed Determination is Conquest, and unconditional Subjugation. But there will be many Words and Blows too, before they will accomplish their Wishes. Poor abandoned, infatuated Nation.  Infatuation is one of the Causes to which, great Historians ascribe many Events: and if it ever produced any Effect, it has produced this War, against America.  Arnold, who carries this, was taken in his Passage from Baltimore. He sailed with Harden, for Boston. They took 15 Vessells, while he was on Board the Man of War. Your Flour was highly favoured with good Luck.  ""

I begin to have some opinion of my good Fortune. If I could have been certain, of the Vessells escaping the many Snares in her Way, I would have sent a dozen Barrells.  The Act, my dear, that you were so fond of will do no good.(1) Legislatures cannot effect Impossibilities. I detest all Embargoes, and all other Restraints upon Trade.(2) Let it have its own Way, in such a Time as this and it will cure its own Diseases. The Paper emitted by the states jointly and separately is too much, it is more than enough to purchase every Commodity and every Species of Labour this is wanted, and this Excess of Quantity is the true Cause of the Artificial Scarcity of Things, but the Price of this will be in Proportion to the Demand, in spite of all Regulations. To save my self the Trouble of thinking I will transcribe for your Amusement a few observations of Lord Kaims, on the subject of Money, Scarcity, Plenty, and Demand. Read them, compare them with the Increase of Money in America, the Decrease of Goods and Labour, and the Increase of Demand for both, and then judge whether the Regulations and Embargoes can do any good....(3)  ""

  Dear Sir Philadelphia April 6. 1777 This Evening I was favoured with yours of 24 March by Major Ward.(1) I thank you, sir for your kind attention to me, and for affording me an opportunity of renewing a Correspondence which has been interrupted on my Part, by an incessant application to Business, and by some little Diffidence in the Post, depend upon it, by no Diminution of Friendship or affection.  Our Country sir, is in an high Fever, but it has a strong Constitution, and good Physicians I hope. The Symptoms are not desperate. The Worst that I see is, a Thinness of the Life blood, I mean the Revenue. But Air, and Regimen, and Exercise, and a little Medicine will restore it---especial- APRIL 6, 1777  ly as it has youth on its side. We have better Prospects of Trade, a Vessell arrived yesterday from Sweden with Powder, Flynts, Lead, sulphur &c &c &c, and I think shall be able to negotiate Loans. Britain cannot procure any great Reinforcements without involving herself in a French and Spanish War-and her Credit in Holland is very low.  The News from France you will learn from Coll Warren to whom I wrote it in Confidence, but he will shew it to you. The Army fills up gradually but rather slowly. There are Troops upon their March from N. Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, towards Head Quarters. The Troops from N. England I hope will soon follow. But my opinion is that the Enemy is more afraid of Us, than we are of them, even now. Their Ruin is inevitable, if our States exert themselves. If they stay at Brunswick they are undone. If they take the Field and march to Philadelphia, there they will meet their Fate, besides that by taking the Field so early, they will lay a Foundation for a sickly Army, thro the whole Campaign. If our General Court had laid their Levies on the Towns last December as I most earnestly intreated them to do, in my opinion Howes destruction would have been effected before now.  I am surprised to hear you call for Lottery Ticketts. Dr. Jackson, one of the Managers, went from this Place, a long Time ago, with a Load of them to Boston.  We have been engaged many days in preparing a Plan for the sick, and I: think the best possible Provision will be made. No Expence will be Spared, and the best Physicians and surgeons will be employed.  We have now Arms and military stores in Abundance. We have Quarter Master and Commissarys stores in Plenty. Blanketts and Cloaths are most wanted, but We have a considerable Quantity of them and expect more. We have Tents of the best Quality for thirty thousand Men.

  My Friend Philadelphia April 6. 1777 The Business of the naval and marine Department, will I hope, be soon put in a better Train than it has been. A Board of Assistants has been appointed here, consisting of three Gentlemen, not Members of Congress, whose whole Time is devoted to the service. Mr Hopkinson, Coll Nixon, and Mr John Wharton are the Men.(1) The first is a Gentleman of Letters, the second an able Merchant, the third an eminent shipwright. APRIL 6, 1777  There is a Talk of appointing a similar Board at Boston, and a Commissioner at every considerable Port in N. England. Who would be proper Persons for those Places? They should be well acquainted with Navigation. They should be well informed in Trade. They should be Men of Character and Credit.(2)  The Marine Committee, have lately recd Letters from Captns. Thompson, McNeal, and several others, pointing out Defects, Abuses and Mismanagement, and proposing Plans of Improvement, Redress and Reformation. These will do good. This is the way to have things go right; for officers to correspond constantly with Congress, and communicate their sentiments freely.  McNeal, I suppose, by his Letter, before this, has sailed, and I hope your Embargo is off, before now, that the Privateers may have fair Play. Indeed I am sorry it was ever laid. I am against all shackles upon Trade. Let the Spirit of the People have its own way, and it will do something. I doubt much whether you have got an hundred Soldiers the more for your Embargo and perhaps you have missed oppertunities of taking many Prizes and several Hundreds of seamen.  South Carolina Seems to display a Spirit of Enterprize in Trade, Superiour to any other State. They have Salt at half a Dollar a Bushell, and dry Goods in great Plenty tho dear. Many French Vessells have arrived there. Some Bermudians and some of their own. They have exported their Crop of Indigo and a great deal of Rice. They have some Privateers, and have made several Prizes.  Tobacco too, begins to be exported in large Quantities from Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina. Vessells sell at very high Prices in all these States. In short in one more year, I fancy Trade will be brisk, in every Part of the Continent, except with Us, the Destruction of whose Fishery has deprived Us of our Staple, and left Us nothing to export. We must build ships and cutt Masts, and take Fish with our Privateers &c. I am &c  ""

I am much obliged to you for your Sentiments, concerning the Navy. A Board I believe will be established at Boston-and a Commissioner in each considerable Port in New England. Complaints are frequently brought here, from Boston and from Providence, concerning the Continental Agents and other officers. I am sorry for this, but cannot help it. At Providence, I fear, by what I have lately heard, there has been a System of selfishness, and at Boston of Incapacity. I had the Honour of belonging to the first Naval Committee, which set all our maritime affairs agoing: and they did it with a Vigour, Assiduity and Dispatch, which precluded all Censure and Complaint. But I went home last December, was twelve Month, and advantage was taken of that oppertunity, one or two other Members being absent at the same Time, Coll Lee went home and Gadsden, and Langdon, and Deane was left out, to choose a new Committee.(3) Since which there has been nothing but Languor, Censure and Complaint. Upon my Return they did me the Honour to put me upon the Board of War, which takes up my whole Time, every Morning and Evening, and renders it totally impossible for me to look into the marine Department, which if I had Leisure to do, ignorant as I am of every Rope in the ship, I would perish if I did not put that Department in a reputable order. There is nothing wanting but some one Person, whose Vigour, Punctuality, and Constancy should draw the Committee together every Morning and Evening, direct their Attention to the Object, and keep it fixed there. There are Gentlemen enough of the Committee who understand the Business, and the Board of assistants are pretty well qualified and every Man upon the Continent, who knows any Thing of the subject might easily be induced to contribute the assistance of His Knowledge at least by Letter.  The Fracas between (4) and McNeal had reached this Place before your Letter. Hope it will do good. Am glad to hear that our Quota is likely to be raised at any Rate. Send them along and let us beat the Scoundrels, to Attoms, as I am Sure we can and shall.

Purviance, inclosing an Invoice of Sloop Diamond's Cargo, and an Account of Disbursements, by which it appears that there is a Ballance due to them of £164.16.8.  After waiting a convenient Time I shall make a fresh Application for the Ballance due to our State, and out of the Monies I may receive pay the above Ballance. If I should not be able to procure an Order on the Treasury in Season, I have wrote those Gentlemen that I would borrow and transmit them the Money due to them upon the first Notice.(1)  Inclosed is a Resolve of Congress respecting your granting Commissions, which I transmit because in the Multiplicity of the Presidents Business it may be forgot by him. I laid the Paragraph of your Letter which related to that Point before Congress immediately upon the Receipt of your Letter. Congress did nothing in the Matter, which amounted to an Acquiescence. A Day or Two ago a Letter from the President of So. Carolina was read in Congress representing that for the Want of Commissions, Instructions &c he had issued Commissions, and desiring that a Resolve might Pass which might give Validity to his Commissions. This brought to my Mind your granting Commissions, and induced me to move the Resolve which is now inclosed. If Contl. Commissions should be wanted you will send for them in Time.(2)  It is said that the Troops, which in a Letter to Commodore Hopkins (3) I mentioned had embarked, and desired him to communicate to you have disembarked; but in a late Letter from the General he does not mention it. It is his Opinion that this City is the great Object of the Enemy and it is too the Sentiment of Genl. Greene.(4) I wish We may be prepared to receive them.  I am greatly mortified to find that the Expedition designed by the Genl. Assembly hath fallen through.(5) To what Cause this is owing, I know not; but I am sorry that the Militia of this Continent should by  APRIL 7, 1777  the military be considered in a Light so little respectable as it is. I know not what Numbers were collected in Consequence of the spirited Resolution of our State, but I should think that Six Thousand Militia conducted by good officers would be sufficient to expell, destroy or captivate the four thousand said to be on Rhode-Island: A Number of whom are doubtless invalids. But this I speak with Submission; for I am unacquainted with the military Walk, I never travelled in it. However in the present as well as the last War Militia did as I remember and have done many notable Feats. I could wish to have this Business taken up again if it can be done with a good Prospect of collecting an Army of six or eight Thousand Men, and some able, spirited Officers to conduct them. I am not alone in my Opinion of the Advantages which would attend such an Expedition, nor of the Prowess of Militia. You will excuse these Hints, suggested and thrown out from a Mortification I feel in having a handfull of the Enemy in Possession of an Island so beneficial to them, when it appears to me that our Militia with the Aid of our Sister States could very easily dislodge or destroy them, and from a Love of Country.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia April 7. 1777  I thank you for your favor which I found here on my return from Virginia.  Weak, and exposed as our enemies are in the Jersies, to a stroke that would be decisive, we cannot avail ourselves of it for want of men, altho we have arms, tents, cloaths, and every necessary ready for 20,000 Soldiers. The Levies come up very slow, and these are obliged to undergo inoculation before they join the Army, so that the General has not more than 4000 with him now, and the enemy have about 7000. Yet they continue narrowed in their quarters and greatly distressed for forage. O for 10, or 12 thousand Americans to sweep these Vermin from our land. We have received very agreable intelligence from the Commissioners (Dr. Franklin, Mr. Deane & Dr. Lee) of the United States to the Court of France. They have been received with great cordiality, promised protection, and an answer to their proposals as soon as Spain has been consulted, with which Country France means to act in close concert. The French had in January 25 sail of the line ready & Spain had 17. And both were certainly to have 30 by April. Ten thousand French troops were marched to Brest, where the Fleet lay, and opposite the English coast, which will no doubt occasion alarm and prevent the sending more Troops from G. Britain.

Hampshire with other Military Stores, and 8,000 stand come in here.  The enemy lately made an attack by surprize on our posts upon the highlands of Hudsons River, but they were repulsed and driven on board their Ships with precipitation and disgrace by an inferior number of American Troops. They have lately embarked Troops at N. York, the Tories say for this City, themselves say they are going to Chesapeake Bay. Some think they mean nothing but to amuse, whilst others imagine they mean to renew their attack on the heights of Hudsons River. Either of the two last opinions I prefer to the former.

  My Dear Sir, Philadelphia 7th Apl 1777 Your favor of the 15th Ulto came to hand Yesterday.(1) I hope Mr. Bettens arrival will hasten the recruiting service, its high time the Troops were in the field, for Heavans sake hurry them on, tho' I hope they will all have march'd before this reaches you. Genl. Gates sets out [this] day to take the Command of the Northern army. One of the Lottery managers is gone Eastward & I hope has Tickets enough to satisfy the thirst for Gaming for I shod be exceeding sorry to hear our state had set up a Lottery. I find Govr Wentworths letter has made no great impression on your mind, nor can it on any one that knows him. In my last I gave you the state of matters in Europe so far as I could collect them from the latest and Best accounts from thence, by which there is very little probability of Britain geting such an army from Russia &c as he tels of.  The Southern States are at least as firm as ever, N Carolina has form'd their Government & chosen Kasswell [Richard Caswell] Govr. Maryland has also form'd a Govt. & placed Tho. Johnson in the Chair who has pass'd a Campaign in Jersey, and its said is now as firm as a Rock. The opposition to Govt. here daily declines & they now go on tolerably well. N. York I expect will give an Infinety of trouble. A long Letter was laid this morning before Congress from that Convention respecting the N. Hampshire Grants, a deputation is also arriv'd from the Green Mountain Boys, but their matters are not yet laid before Congress. I sho'd not much care if the Devil had them all.(2)  What advantage could have arisen from a compliance with Genl. Lee's request? Genl Howe certainly wod not agree to the conference unless he Expected to reap some advantage by it, he surely wod not permit an interveiw that cod possibly opperate to his disadvantage, if he has powers to treat with America as Independant States, the door is always open for him, we know very well he has no new powers, nor nothing to offer but Pardon on submission. At the same time that we cod receive no possible Benefit by complying with the Request, the Enemy wod profit much by it. A Packet wod be immediately dispatch'd, & all the Courts in Europe amus'd with our negociations & the strongest assurences given that peace wod soon take place in America. This was the use made of the Conference last faul by which means the stores that are now arriving, have been  APRIL 8, 1777  delay'd at least 4 months. The insidious designs were so very evident that there was not a single advocate for the measure.  By intelligence receiv'd by deserters & others the Enemy seem to be preparing to put themselves in motion. Which way they will bend their course is a matter of great speculation. Some suppose this City is their object, others think they will make a decent on the Eastern shore of Virginia & Maryland while others are of opinion that they will persue their original plan up Hudsons River, for my own part I think they are very much puzzels, for if they divide the small force they have ruin awaits them.  I am very glad I am like to be reliev'd & hope it will be by the Gentn you mention since you are determined not to spend another Summer in Philad.(3) I hope they will be here by the middle of May.

  Dear Sir Philadelphia April 8. 1777 Tuesday I had your Favour of 27 March by this Days post.(1) That this Country will go Safely through this Revolution, I am well convinced, but We have severe Conflicts to endure yet, and I hope shall be prepared for them, indeed there is one Enemy, which to me is more formidable, than Famine, Pestilence and the Sword, I mean the Corruption which is prevalent in so many American Hearts, a Depravity that is more inconsistent with our Republican Governments, than Light is with Darkness. If We can once give Energy enough to our Governments, and Discipline enough to our Armies to overcome this base Principle of selfishness, to make Citizens and soldiers feel themselves the Children of the Commonwealth, and love and revere their Mother so much, as to make their Happiness consist in her service I shall think We have a Prospect of Tryumph indeed.  Your design, sir of collecting Materials for an History of the Rise, Progress and Issue of the American Revolution, is liberal and generous, and as you will find it a laborious Undertaking, you ought to be encouraged and assisted in it.(2) I should be very willing to contribute any Thing in my Power, towards so usefull a Work. But I must frankly tell you there is very little in my Power. So far from making Collections myself I have very often destroyed the Papers in my Power, and my own Minutes of Events and their Causes. We are hurried away in such a Kind of Delirium arising from the Multiplicity of Affairs, and the Disorder in which they rise in Review before Us that I confess myself unable even to recollect the Circumstances of any Transactions with sufficient Precision to assist an Historian. There are Materials however in Possession of the Secretary of State, and others in the War office, which will be preserved. The Mass  APRIL 8, 1777  Bay however was the first Theatre and your History should begin at least from the year 1761.  Your Correspondent, whoever he is, has a Talent at Panegyrick enough to turn an Head that has much less Vanity in it, than mine. Sometimes however the extravagance of Flattery is an Antidote to its Poison. I shall not however be made to tremble to think of the Expectations that will be formed from me, by such wild Praises. No such Attributes belong to me; and I am under no concern about answering to what may be justly expected of me. Alass ! Who is equal to those Things?

Mr Hastings's Petition will be attended to, I believe and hope, and his allowance made more adequate to his Merit and services.(4)  I hear a Comtee is come to the Jersies, to know how many Troops are to be posted in our State. I hope our State will not think of detaining any of them.

When that is the case you are then to draw nearer to the Coast of North America, and Cruise along the said Coast from Block Island to the Capes of Virginia doing your true endeavour to take, burn, Sink, or destroy as many of the enemies Ships and Vessels of every kind as you may have the good fortune to fall in with. The prizes you may be lucky enough to take you will send into such Ports of the United states as you shall think will be the safest from the informations you may receive, you are to pay due attention to the printed Instructions from the Navy Board. It is possible that we may think proper to give you fresh Orders which shall be lodged with Henry Fisher at Lewis Town, and the light House will be ordered to shew a large white sheet when they have such orders and find a frigate in sight Should any unfortunate accident befall you destroy these Orders rather than let the enemy get them, and you will as opportunities occur transmit us Accounts of your proceedings.

  Sir April 8th 1777  It seems currently reported that the Frigate Virginia under your command is ready for the Sea and that She only waits for Orders. Hoping this may really be the case, we despatch the following Instructions by which APRIL 8, 1777  you are to be governed.(1) You are immediately to proceed with the said Frigate to sea, embracing such favourable winds as may be likely to run you quickly of[f] the Coast, for as we know you are not in condition to meet the enemies Ships in Battle on advantageous terms at present, we wish you to avoid them until you get well manned and your People tollerably trained, therefore soon as you clear the land schape your Course for the Island of Martinico, and there deliver to William Bingham esqr. American Resident at that Port the letter sent herewith directed for him. We expect a quantity of Arms, ammunition, Cloathing and Other Stores to be lodged with him by this time and he is directed to put a part of them on board the Virginia and you will direct them to be received on board, granting bills of lading for what are so received. Should Mr. Bingham have shipped these Stores or the greatest part of them previous to your Arrival, it is likely there may be Others at St. Eustatia and you may apply there to Mr. Saml Curson junr., Mr. Cornelius Stevenson & Mr Henricus Goddet for any such that may have come to their hands granting them bills of Lading for what you receive. When you arrive at Martinico Mr Bingham will inform you what British ships of war are amongst the Windward Islands, also what other of the enemies Cruizers are there, and whether the Inhabitants of the British West India Islands continue the practice of fitting out ships in a Piratical manner without commissions and if upon a veiw of these things Mr Bingham and you should be of opinion that it will be useful to our Commerce for you to make a short Cruize amongst the Islands for the purpose of protecting our Trade and distressing the enemy by all means let it be done.  The British Ships of war after being any length of time in the West Indies are rarely well manned and as we hope your Ship will sail well, we hope you may either be able to cope with them in Battle or to outsail them, as to any other Cruizers they must outsail or submit to you, but if you can add some of the enemies ships to our Navy it will render essential Service to your Country, inspirit our Seamen and do honor to yourself.  Should you take any Prizes whose Cargoes are perishable or particularly suited to the West India Markets you may order such articles to be sold there and lodge the Money with Mr. Bingham taking his drafts for the same, but the Ship and other parts of the Cargo must come to America for condemnation.  You will be particularly attentive to collect as many Seamen as possible, not only what may be necessary for the Virginia, but as many as you can bring to assist in manning the rest of our Navy. It is expected that you contend warmly on all necessary occasions for the honor of the American Flag. At every foreign port you enter salute their Forts, and wait on the Governor, General or Commander in chief, asking liberty of their Ports for the Ships of the United States of America. Take care that your people do not molest their Trade or Inhabitants nor in any shape disturb   that good understanding we have with them. We think you should not only attempt to get seamen at every port you touch at, but also encourage them to enter from every Prize you take, and if amongst these you should number any of the British ships of war, you must be particularly attentive to prevail on the most useful Petty & Warrant officers to engage in our Service-the encouragement for them is great and we want them much. When your errand to the West Indies is compleated you are to return to some Port in these states.  The uncertainty of the state of war and the stations the enemy may choose for their large Ships makes it improper we should fix positively on any one particular, but as it is likely those middle states may be the Seat of war the nearer you can land the stores to our Army the better. It is expected from every Commander in our Navy that he will use his officers and people well, still preserving Strict discipline and decorum, that prisoners be treated with humanity, that great care be taken of the ships, their materials & stores, and that due attention be paid to the private Instructions of the Navy Board. We are Sir,  Your very hble Servts P. S. You have herewith signals whereby to know the American ships of war.  ""

  April 8. 1777 The declaration of independance [first?] was said to have divided & weakned the colonies. The contrary of this was the case. Nothing but the signing, & recognizing of the declaration of independance preserved the Congress from a dissolution in Decemr 1776 when Howe marched to the Delaware. Maryland had instructed her delegates to concur in an Accommodation notwithstanding any measure (meaning independance) to the contrary. But further the declaration of independance produced a secession of tories, timid, moderate & double minded men from the counsels of America in consequence of which the congress as well as each of the states have possessed ten times the vigor and strength they had formerly.  April 8th 1777 Genl. Howe's army at Brunswick & New York is now in Motion. A majority of the people of Philada. think that their destination is up the North river in order to join Genl. Carleton so as to cut off the communication between the Eastern & Southern states agreeably to the original plan of the British ministry. But I think it most probable that their object APRIL 8, 1777  is Philada. for the following reasons. 1. Because it is obviously agst. the interest of Howe's army to come to Philada. and a ignorance of their true interest is the only thing that has appeared like uniformity in their conduct. 2ly. The design of the present war is to chastise the people of America, and this can only be done by changing the seat of war & 3ly. To purify it of toriism and to eradicate timi[di]ty & moderation. This can only be done by Howe's coming within the sphere of the attraction of the tories & moderate men. 4ly. There is a false confidence in the situation & Strength of the city of Philada, and in the Spirit & number of our troops. The same kind of confidence prevd. in New York before its reduction last year.  April 8th 1777 I think it more than probable that General Washington will not Close the present war wth G Britain.  1. Because in ordinary revolutions different characters always appear in their first and last stages.  2. Because his talents are better fitted to unite the people of America into one body than to give them Afterwards a national complexion.  3. Because his talents are unequal to those degrees of discipline, and decision which alone can render an army finally successful.  4. Because he is idolized by the people of America, and is tho't to be absolutely necessary for us to enable us to carry on the war.  ""

Pox, which I should have acknowledged before this, if I had not been unfortunately detained on the Road between Baltimore & Philadelphia for more than three Weeks by my Wife's Illness. I did not get to this Place 'til Monday Evening, & am now so much unsettled that I have hardly time to write. Lodgings are with difficulty to be procured, & I fear a House cannot be had at any Rate so that I expect to be forced to put up with a Tavern. Genl. Howe keeps this divided City in constant Fear. Many wish for his coming, & many others are too timid to oppose it. If he should attempt it, which is the Opinion of several of our Generals, we must again fly; for Genl. Washington has not a Force sufficient to oppose him. It is my Opinion however that his Design is to get Possession of the North River, which appears to me to be of more real Consequence to him than this Place. Up the N. River he will at present meet with but little Oppisition. Philadelphia he cannot keep against a superior Army. Genls. Green & Putnam (1) mention his having collected a Number of Transports & Boats at Amboy, with a View, as they think to bring his Troops round by Water to this Place; but this I look upon to be done only to conceal his real Design upon the N. River. A few Days will make us certain what their Intentions are. They are moving Part of their Troops from Brunswick to Amboy, so that if we had any thing of an Army they might be APRIL 9, 1777  destroyed. What would you think of sparing for a little Time the three Regiments belonging to the State? They are, I am informed, well armed & cloathed. If we had them now they would be of infinite Service.

Excuse me to Mann for not answering his Letter, which I will do as soon as I have time, & beg him to accept of the Ovid which you have belonging to me, & to remember that it is a Reward for his Merit.

He Said That there were a number of the Enemy's Ships of War in Chesepeak Bay So that he could not go to Virginia, That he wanted 750 Dollars toward paying for a Cargo of Flour which he had purchased upon which I moved Congress to Advance to the State of Connecticut one thousand Dollars which was Granted, (1) and I delivered 750 of them to Captain Niles and he drew a Bill on your Honr. for payment. The whole is Charged to the State and I must acct for it when I return home. Nothing very material has occurred here Since my last. Congress has passed Some Resolutions for regulating a Hospital in the army which will be published in the News Papers.(2)All the States are now Represented, and next Monday is assigned for considering the Articles of Confederation.(3) I wish there was a more full representa- tion from our State. Congress received a Letter from Dr. Franklin, Arthur Lee & Silas Dean dated about the 27th of January. It does not contain any thing material more than what has been published in the News Papers. They have been offered a loan of Two million Livres without Interest payable after the United States are settled in Peace and Safety which they Gratefully accepted for the use of the States & 500,000 Livres has been received. All ranks favour our cause. It was not certainly known to them whether a war between Gr Britain & France would be Soon Declared. I am informed by Mr. Duer a Delegate from the State of New York that Governor Franklin is very busy with the Tories and has de- APRIL 9, 1777  livered out a number of Protections from General How and that any person can obtain a Protection in Connecticut, that this is publickly known there and no measures taken to prevent it. I received a Letter from a Friend Yesterday informing me that the Assembly has repealed the Law prescribing an Oath of Fidelity which I was very Sorry to hear.(4)I expect a recommendation will soon be made by Congress to all the States to administer an Oath not only to the officers & Electors, but to all Suspected persons as a Test to discriminate between Friends & foes. I esteem our internal enemies much the most dangerous. The people on the New Hamshire Grants have Petitioned Congress to be acknowledged an Independent State, and admited to Send Delegates to Congress. The Convention of New York has also remonstrated against their proceedings, requesting Congress to interpose for preventing the defection of the people on the Grants from that State. Nothing has been yet acted on the affair. The recruiting Service does not go on here so fast as could be wished. In Virginia I understand their Battalions are about two thirds full, in the Carolinas near full. It is Strange that we can't muster an army of fifteen thousand from all the States. I Suppose that number would now be Sufficient to Subdue the Enemy's force in New Jersey.  It Seems to me the Spirit of true Patriotism declines, a Spirit of Selfishness & Oppression prevails.  The Convention of Committees for the Middle States is broke up without doing any thing to remedy the evils attending the high & fluctuating prices of articles.  A Vessel has lately arrived here from Sweden with Arms & Ammunition. I hope two of the Connecticut Delegates are on their way for this place before now. I should have wrote to them, but have long expected that they were coming here, & So would probably miss of receiving my letters.

  Sir, Philadelphia 9t. April 1777  I Wrote to you the 22d Ultimo since which I have recd no Letter from you, but I do not think this a Circumstance of that Consequence as that it ought to prevent my Writing to you again, for as I know your Ability to pay, I need not be concerned how much I got you in my Debt especially as I hope you will be well disposed to answer the Obligation.  I find my Friends imagine that they ought not to Write till they have got what they call proper Materials for a Letter. This I think is a Very great Mistake for I think a Letter may be Very well Wrote without either Materials or Invention. I take it to be a Maxim in the Business of Letter Writing and I think it is a Very good one, that the Subject and Mode of Letter Writing ought to be as near as possible to common Conversation, this you Very Well know may be carryed on forever without either Meaning or Intention. I hope therefore that you will not Omit Writing to Me, till you may have heard of some great political Event and not mention that neither because you may suppose that I must hear of it sooner than you can tell Me. Possibly you may have before long a better excuse for not Writing to me oftener, as you may hear of the Movement of the Enemy and so fear least your Letters might fall into their Hands. They are douptless meditating Mischief at all Times and it seems not unlikely that may pretty soon endeavour to put a Design of this kind into Execution.  Howe has ordered his officers to be at their Station by to Morrow, he is fortifying Brunswick tho he has sent off a Very considerable Part of the Troops which he had there to Amboy. The Army of the Enemy are principally collected at Staten Island tho a comparable Number of them it is said are Embarked. Howe I imagine thinks it to be a matter of Moment to Exert himself before More of our Forces are collected. Many Think that this principal Object is this City, it may be so, tho' I rather doubt wheither this be his principal Design, a Feint may be made this Way, but I will not trouble you with Conjecture, the Enemy will probably explain their Designs. As a War in Europe may be soon expected and as our own military Establishment may be soon respectable, the Enemy Wish to avail themselves of what may be in their Power before those Events take Place. Our Army is Encreasing dayly, and if the Enemy do not get an advantage Very soon they will probably not get it another time. But the Collecting an Army seems to be a slower Peice of Business than one ought to Expect. How affairs in the Recruiting Way have gone on in Connecticut I have not been particularly informed, tho I hope their Battalions may by this Time be full. Many of the Recruits I hope are already thro with the small Pox and on their Way to Camp. But however I will not Conjecture what the State of our Troops are any more than I will of the Designs of the Enemy, for I gain no kind of  APRIL 9, 1777  Intelligence from Connecticut but what I get by the publick Prints. I beleive that as the small Pox is amongst our People they are forbid Writing least they should communicate the Infection. But whatever be the Cause the Fact is so.

I suppose they must be most eagerly engaged in some most Momentous Pursuit, Otherwise I am Very sure they could not fail in oblidging me so much as to put a Letter of the Length of three Lines which is as long as I shall insist upon, if it is Wrote upon the Subject that I am most concerned to know, which is how my Family are. I say that if Business of great Consequence did not hinder they would so farr gratify me as to put a Letter of the aforesaid Length into the Post office at Hartford from which I should undouptedly receive it within a Week after it was lodged there. But if you do not now enjoy Health I pray God that you may soon have it and that you will as no other will undertake the Task let me know how the Family are. I shall Endeavour to Write to you every Week. I hope you receive my Letters. I notice on every one such as I have sent before that which is then Written so that you might know when you receive all of them. My three last were of the 15t and 22d March and lt of this Month.(1) APRIL 9, 1777  By the Blessing of God I enjoy Health, which is more than I could have much Reason to expect in this confined Way of living. And as to News I mentioned what had Occurred in my Letter to Mr Reeve of the 3d instant since which nothing Material has happened. The Enemy are meditating some movement, what that will be will soon perhaps be discovered. They douptless Wish to come to this City but wheither they will Risque an Attempt of this kind can only be the Subject of Conjecture. American Affairs undouptedly bear a better Aspect than they did a few Months past and a fortunate consequential Blow on our part, might nearly settle the present dispute. God grant that this insolent barbarous Enemy may be spedily curbed and that the happy Days of Peace may Return. But at all Events the Freedom of this Country must be established which can never be done but by establishing the Independancy of it. The Probability of that is so great, that scarcely the least Degree of Doubt can remain respecting the Accomplishing of it. But if the Blessing is bestowed which I fully beleive it will be, the Favour will be granted to a People who in no respect may be said to deserve it, except on Acco. of the Injuries which they receive from Britain, for as to the Morals and Virtue of this People I beleive they have for a long time been upon a most rapid decline.  My Letter from Dr. Smith of the 12t ult was that all the Family were out of Danger on Acco. of the small Pox but that Mariana had had it Very hard, which is unusual for People who are inoculated. This was owing perhaps to some Accident. I wish to know wheither she is like to suffer any ill and lasting Impression in Consequence of the Disease.  You may expect that I should say something in regard to my Returning Home, which at present I do not know what to inform you of. I trust the affairs of America will soon put on a brighter Face and I hope will make a favourable Crisis before long, and whenever that shall be the Case I shall most gladly Wish to injoy the Sweets of domestick Happiness. But as I have had so much Service to go thro with in this important Dispute I should be glad to See more clearly the probable End of it before I leave the Service. However I have not settled this matter in my own mind at present. It is said that Col. Dyer and Williams will soon be here, if so my continuance will not be supposed Necessary and I shall therefore consider it as merely optionable and shall do what I judge may be proper. I sometimes Wonder that I should trouble you with so long Letters as I do. I would not have you think that I am Fool enough to suppose my Letters of any Consequence. I Write just what occurs to me Very much to gratify myself. I am in the Condition of great Talkers who never Think any Body is tired of hearing them while they feel themselves so much pleased with their own tattle. After I have Wrote three or four sides down I then look over my Letter and blot out and interline so as to make it in any Degree intilligeble. This Letter will go to you I dare say in that Condition and I beleive it is time to put it in that form.  APRIL 10, 1777  There are a Thousand Questions which I want to ask, but which I shall never have answered till I return home-and so I will not trouble you with them. Perhaps I may Write a Letter to somebody at Litchfield by this Post. I beleive I shall, tho I owe them no Letters, yet it may put them into a Way of not expecting a formal Letter to every one which they send Me. If they are afraid that there Letters will Miscarry they can Write upon any general Subject, which may give Me a great deal of particular Information tho' it never can our Old Foe Howe. But I will look over my Letter and so Adieu this Time. May the best of Heavens Blessings be yours. My love to My Children and Freinds. Yours inviolably, Oliver Wolcott  P.S. Since I Wrote the above, I am well informed that Howe is fortifying Brunswick while at the same time he has been sending off to Amboy a large part of the Troops which he had there. All Officers in the British service are strictly ordered to their post by the tenth inst. The British Army are principally collected at Staten Island. Many Circumstances Evidence some important Design of theirs to be soon put into Operation which it must be left to time to discover.  ""

  Sir, Philadelphia April 10, 1777 In obedience to an older of Congress we do ourselves the honor to inform your Excellency of the reasons and principles that have governed Congress in their resolution for forming a Camp on the west side of Delaware.(1) The repeated information that hath been received of the enemies movements, and it being the opinion of your Excellency, as well as of many other General Officers, that this City was the Object of such movements, rendered it proper that means should be fallen upon, to prevent the success of such a design, as well to guard against the bad impression that it would certainly have on the affairs of America in general, as to give security to the valuable Stores here collected, and which cannot speedily be removed.  It has been considered that if the real design of the enemy should be against this City, the Troops are here well fixed, and will be an encouraging place of resort to the Militia of this State in their present unfixt condition, being between their old plan of association, and their new, but yet unexecuted, law. On the other hand, should the design of the enemy be upon Hudsons river, or more eastward, the Troops here may with ease APRIL 10, 1777  reach that river, before those now at Head Quarters can have all crossed it. But other considerations remain, and they are, should the enemy continue in Jersey with a view to attack your Army, or should your Excellency mean to make a decisive impression on them when your numbers are sufficient, in either supposition. the Troops ought not to be here. And therefore, in the whole of this business, Congress means not, in any manner, to interfere with the designs, or to counteract the Judgement of your Excellency, but wish you freely to call up to Head Quarters, all, or any part of the Troops encampt here as you shall please. It is not supposed that this will occasion any delay, and will certainly prevent the injuries that would be derived to the Troops, as well in health as discipline, from their entering and remaining any time in this City.  We are, with sentiments of much esteem, Your Excellencies most obedient humble servants,  Richard Henry Lee Geo. Clymer John Adams Abra. Clark ""

  My dear General Philadelphia 10 April 1777 The resolves of Congress that you will receive by this Messenger, you may be assured, are not intended, by any means, to obstruct your views a single moment.(1) If your judgment should incline you to think that the Troops had better march on to Head Quarters quick as possible, you have only so to order it, and it will give pleasure to every good man here. The business of speedily reenforcing you will not be obstructed, but accelilated, because they now enter the City, where every days stay is 30 days injury to the great purpose of strengthening your hands. And should the enemy destine here, something like a military collection, may produce a greater resort. If you will indulge my conjecture, I think they cannot purpose coming here, because the water securities against such a plan are realy formidable, and the situation of the land, where the water obstructions are fixed, is such, that great delay, and probable ruin forbids the enterprize, APRIL 10, 1777  as they cannot so fix land Batteries as to remove the strong Vessels that protect the Cheveaux de Frize, added to the numerous fire rafts & Fire ships that in a narrow water with strong current may destroy their Fleet. Your Army Sir feeble as it is, and the North River, are more tempting Objects, because they are not strong, and because the defeat of the one, or the acquisition of the other, would avail our enemies greatly.  My wishes are Sir, and I think they correspond with the true interest of America, that you should quickly be possessed of a strong Army, that your powers might be such as to gratify your wishes of crushing of our enemies before an addition of strength to them may render the business more difficult & uncertain. I think I well know your situation and from your excellent disposition, I know your feelings, and I do most ardently wish to make the former good, and to render the latter agreable, and therefore, whenever I can know either from yourself all the powers I possess shall be exerted to accomplish both. The Troops of Maryland are now under inoculation, and so are about 1000 Virginians from Baltimore to Wilmington inclusive. Here, we suppose, may be near a thousand of all kinds, who by the now plan of encampment, will be in Tents as quickly as the Physicians can discharge them, or the Officers collect them from this attractive Scene of debauch and amusement.  With every hearty wish for your health and prosperity I remain, dear Sir Most affectionately yours, Richard Henry Lee  ""

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia April 10th. 1777 Yesterday it was agreed in Congress that the subject of the Articles of Confederacy should be taken up on Monday next and that two days in each week should be employed therein until that work should be compleated. As this is a matter of the utmost importance it is certainly necessary that our State should be fully represented, especially as I am by no means competant to the task. I therefore most ardently wish you would give your attendance in Congress and beg you would write to Mr. Vandike, pressing his immediate repair hither.(1) I am in a most disagreeable situation, a stranger to every person, unable to speak my sentiments in Congress and no Coleague to confer with on any subject that may concern our State.(2) There has already a matter been determined which I am afraid will throw the whole County of Sussex into confusion and disorder. I think it is a report from the board of War that an Independant Company shall be raised in that County to be stationed at Lewis Town, that Harry Fisher shall have the Command, if he refuses that he shall have at least the appointment of the Subaltern Officers. This was brought in immediately upon my taking my seat in Congress and tho I utterly disapproved the measure as far as it respected Fisher, I could not open my mouth in objection. This, Sir. shews the necessity of some person being here who has the inclination and power to object to and shew the impropriety of such appointments. I am totally unfit for it and am miserable on the occasion. From what we hear from Head Quarters it seems to be the prevailing opinion there that the Enemy intend to Philadelphia in a very short time, that the Fleet are coming into this River and their Boats are preparing for the Army to cross the same.  I should be exceeding sorry to press you on a subject that I know at this Time is disagreeable, I mean your attendance here, but it appears to me to be indispensably necessary to our State that you should be in Congress, with respect to myself it is so much so that without your at- APRIL 11, 1777  tendance I cannot think of staying, alone I will not.

  Sunday April 13, 1777 Enclosed with this you have a Correspondence, between the two Generals, concerning the Cartell for the Exchange of Prisoners.  Washington is in the Right, and has maintained his Argument with a Delicacy, and a Dignity, which do him much Honour.(1)  He has hinted, at the flagitious Conduct of the two Howes, towards their Prisoners, in so plain and clear a manner, that he cannot be misunderstood; but: yet a decency and a Delicacy is preserved which is the more to be applauded, because the natural Resentment of such Atrocious Cruelties renders it very difficult to avoid a more pointed Language, in describing them. They might indeed, without much Impropriety, have been painted in crimson Colours of a deeper Die.  If Mr. Howes Heart is not callous, what must be his Feelings, when he recollects the Starvings, the Freezings, the pestilential Diseases, with which he coolly and deliberate[ly] destroyed the Lives of so many, unhappy Men. If his Conscience is not seared, how will he bear its Lashes when he remembers his Breach of Honour, his Breach of Faith, his offence against Humanity, and Divinity, his Neighbour and his God, if he thinks there is any such Sumpreme Being, in impairing Health that he ought to have cherished, and in putting and End to Lives that he ought to have preserved, and in choosing the most slow, lingering and torturing Death, that he could have devised?  I charitably suppose, however, that he would have chosen the shortest Course and would have put every Man, to the Sword or Bayonett, and thereby have put an End to their Sufferings, at once, if he could have done it without Detection. But this would have been easily proved upon him, both by his Friends and Enemies. Whereas, by Hunger, Frost and Disease, he might commit the Murders, with equal Certainty, and yet be able to deny that he had done it. He might lay it to Hurry, to Confusion, to the  APRIL 13, 1777  fault of Commissaries and other Officers. Nay might deny, that they were starved, frozen and infected.  He was determined to put them out of the Way, and yet to deny it, to get rid of his Enemies, and yet save his Reputation. But his Reputation is ruined forever.  The two Brothers will be ranked by Posterity with Pizarro, with Borgia, with Alva, and with others in the Annals of Infamy, whose Memories are intituled to the Hisses and Execrations of all virtuous Men.  These two unprincipled Men are the more detestable, because they were in the opposition at home, their Connections, Friendships and Interest lay with the opposition, to the opposition they owed their Rise, Promotion and Importance. Yet they have basely deserted their Friends and Party, and have made themselves the servile Tools of the worst of Men in the Worst of Causes.  But what will not desperate Circumstances tempt Men to do, who are without Principle? and who have a strong aspiring Ambition, a towering Pride, and a tormenting Avarice.  These two Howes were very poor, and they have spent the little Fortunes they had in bribery at Elections, and having obtained Seats in Parliament, and having some Reputation as brave Men, they had nothing to do but to carry their Votes and their Valour to Markett, and it is very true, they have sold them at an high Price.  Are Titles of Honour, the Reward of Infamy? Is Gold a Compensation for Vice? Can the one or the other, give that Pleasure to the Heart, that Comfort to the Mind, which it derives from doing Good? from a Consciousness of Acting, upon upright and generous Principles, of promoting the Cause of Right, Freedom and the Happiness of Men.  Can Wealth or Titles soften the Pains of the Mind upon reflecting that a Man has done Evil, and endeavoured to do Evil to Millions, that he has destroyed free Governments and established Tyrannies!  I would not be an Howe, for all the Empires of the Earth, and all the Riches, and Glories thereof.  Who would not rather be brave, even tho unfortunate, in the Cause of Liberty? Who would not rather be Sydney, than Monk?  However, if I am not deceived, Misfortune as well as Infamy awaits these Men. They are doomed to defeat, and Destruction. It may take Time to effect it, but it will certainly come. America is universally convinced of the Necessity of meeting them in the Field in firm Battallion- and American Fire is terrible.  ""

  April 13. 1777 I have spent an Hour, this Morning, in the Congregation of the dead. I took a Walk into the Potters Field, a burying Ground between the new stone Prison, and the Hospital, and I never in my whole Life was affected with so much Melancholly. The Graves of the soldiers, who have been buryed, in this Ground, from the Hospital and bettering House, during the Course of the last Summer, Fall, and Winter, dead of the small Pox, and Camp Diseases, are enough to make the Heart of stone to melt away.  The Sexton told me, that upwards of two Thousand soldiers had been buried there, and by the Appearance, of the Graves, and Trenches. it is most probable to me, he speaks within Bounds.  To what Causes this Plague is to be attributed I dont know. It seems to me, that the Want of Tents. Cloaths, soap, Vegetables, Vinegar, Vaults &c. cannot account for it all.  Oatmeal and Peas, are a great Preservative of our Enemies. Our Frying Pans and Gridirons, slay more than the Sword.  Discipline, Discipline is the great Thing wanted. There can be no order, nor Cleanliness, in an Army without Discipline.  We have at last, determined on a Plan for the Sick, and have called into the Service the best Abilities in Physick and Chirurgery, that the Continent affords. I pray God it may have its desired Effect, and that the Lives and Health of the Soldiers may be saved by it.  Disease has destroyed Ten Men for Us, where the Sword of the Enemy has killed one.  Upon my Return from my pensive melancholly Walk, I heard a Piece of disagreable News-That the ship Morris, Captain Anderson from Nantz, with Cannon, Arms, Gunlocks, Powder &c. was chased into Delaware Bay by two or three Men of War-that she defended herself manfully against their Boats and Barges, but finding no Possibility of getting clear, she run aground. The Crew, and two French Gentlemen Passengers got on shore, but the Captain, determined to disappoint his Enemy in Part, laid a Train and blew up the ship, and lost his own Life unfortunately in the Explosion. I regret the Loss of so brave a Man much more than that of the ship and Cargo. The People are fishing in order to save what they can, and I hope they will save the Cannon. The French Gentlemen, it is said have brought Dispatches from France to the Congress.(1) I hope this is true. If it is, I will let you know the Substance of it, if I may be permitted to disclose it.

  My dear sir Philadelphia April 13. 1777 In considering a Letter from the General, sometime ago, in the Board of War, it was agreed to report to Congress a Resolution, approving of the Laboratory at Springfield, and such a Report was made, but upon some opposition to it, it was ordered to lye on the Table, where it has lain ever since. I will move to have it taken up and determined. Some Gentlemen will oppose it, particularly the President, I believe, thinking Brookfield the best Place. I am not very clear myself, that it is the best, but from a greater Confidence in the opinion of General Washington and General Knox, than in my own, I voted for it, and shall continue to do so.(1)  I will hazard a Conjecture, concerning the Motions of the Enemy. in which very few here agree with me. I think they are neither to move up Delaware, nor Hudsons River untill they have a Strong Reinforcement. They are turning their Men out upon Staten Island to graze-to breath a fresh keen Air, and to take a Course of Exercise for the Recovery of their Health. Depend upon it, sir, their Army, at this season of the year is too Sickly, relaxed and unsettled to take the Field. and it is too early if they were healthy, it would lay a foundation for a sickly disastrous Campaign. It is not to be expected that every State will provide their full Quota of Men, nor shall We have occasion for such a Number, unless the Enemy, have a Reinforcement greater than We have any Idea of at present. I can have no Conception of the Necessity of Sixty or seventy thousand Men to oppose an Army of Ten or Eleven thousand, in one Place and another of seven or Eight thousand in another. Our Men are as good as theirs, and I am not afraid to trust them Man for Man. If our officers will not lead their Men I am for Shooting all who will not and getting a new set. It is high Time for Us to abandon this execrable defensive Plan. It will be our Ruin if We do not. Long Lines, and defensive Systems have very near undone Us. Our Men, New England men especially universally detest and despise, defensive operations, and are dispirited by them, in such a manner as to be good for nothing. But they APRIL 14, 1777  will follow a spirited enterprising officer any where. We dont understand Sufficiently the Doctrine of Diversions. One Thousand Men upon Long Island would find Employment for three or four Thousand of theirs. So might a few others upon Staten Island. But our Army has ever been such an enormous Mass of Deadness and Torpor, that I dont wonder their Inactivity has bred the Plague among them.  We must have a fighting enterprizing Spirit conjured up in our Army. The Army that Attacks has an infinite Advantage, and ever has had from the Plains of Pharsalia to the Plains of Abraham, the Plains of Trenton and Princeton. I will perish if our Troops behave ill if you lead them on to an attack.  ""

I am glad Guns are like to be made in the Massachusetts for the Raliegh, for were they to be depended on from this place I fear it wod be a long time before they wod have them, the furnices are Backward owing to the great difficulty in getting men, and then the Risque in getting them by water is very great that I think the chance is against their being there these six months. Since my last we have receiv'd advice from an agent we have at Martinico that several Privateers are fited out at that place with American Commissions who have taken many British vessels. This gives great uneasiness to the English Govrs. who have remonstrated to the Genl. of Martinico, whose answer is that the Americans fight under their own standard & in their own cause, and if some of the French Subjects are seduced into their service he is not answerable.(1) He, the agent, also says he has seen a confidential letter from a person of high distinction in Paris who says that the American negociations goes on smothly & that the act of Independence will soon be recognis'd by that Court in the most ample manner. This accot is later then any we have had from our Commissioners but coroborates the last accots from them. I have just heard that a Ship from Nants was chas'd ashore near Cape Henlopen by two of the Enemies Ships. The Capt Blew her up, to prevent her falling into the Enemies hands and unfortunately lost his life. Many of the Goods, its said are saved.  15th.

 APRIL 15, 1777  ing the Gentlemen of your Council. I hope, Sir, they will find more inclination, & less inconvenience, from the result of your Assembly.  I am pleased with your determination to reside in Newbern, if for no other reason but that of facilitating the communication between us. I will not fail to transmit you every thing worth your attention, in the order which I have mentioned & observe in most letters which I have hitherto written: but considering the value of your time, I shall spare you the trouble of unimportant reading.  In your favour of the 26th you have prophesied what has since in a great measure come to pass. All particular jealousies are for the present laid to sleep, & long & uninterrupted may their slumbers be. We are more wisely employed in giving vigor to our military operations, & in correcting abuses in our departments. The success of the recruiting service is not yet very remarkable in the Northern States, notwithstanding the Embargo, to which you allude.(3) Mr S. Adams informs me, from the best authority, that our Lottery tickets have met with a sale amazingly rapid, & that the Loan office is successful.  I am very much concerned for the apprehensions you express relative to the indolence of our officers. Many abuses are complained of from every quarter in the recruiting service, & it is at length found to proceed from the idea that the civil power of the States had no control over them. This is what I had suggested very soon after by arrival at Congress, but it was always reluctantly listened to, until the abuse was complained of from many quarters, & attributed to the same cause. I brought in a Resolution for correcting the abuse through the interventions of the States, & was very happy in finding no opposition made on the old ground. It produced a reference to a Committee, & the result was the Resolutions which the President transmits to you, & of which the inclosed is a copy.(4)  I doubt not your vigorous exertions to root out all the evils in that department, which may be found in the State over which you preside. The Resolution with respect to servants was originally followed by a clause, requiring compensation to be made to owners & masters; but it fell through, on an equal division; those voting against it, who were most interested in the affirmative.(5) The day (viz 1 5th May) is not well calculated for your State: but that Resolution is expected & intended to have its effect in the States nearer to the field of action, & that day was deemed remote enough for that purpose.(6) Upon the whole, Sir, I hope it will every where have as great effect as it can.  We have for a few days been alarmed here, tho', I believe, without foundation. No consternation followed upon this occasion, but measures were calmly taken to oppose the Enemy. The Congress are sensible of the impropriety of their last flight, & I believe they will not again fall into the like error. I have added all in my power to confirm them in this disposition, & the timid members have encountered such poignant ridicule from many quarters, that I believe they deem the approach of the  enemy less formidable than another series of the like encounters. I, for my own part, intend to stay in the city, & give my best assistance for its defence, unless it shall be determined to abandon it altogether.  I inclose you the paper of the last date, which contains every intelligence I can give you. The dispatches from France mentioned in it contain little more than that it is the current opinion in Britain, that ten thousand men will be sent the ensuing summer against Virginia & Maryland, under the command of General Burgoin.  You will be pleased to excuse any inaccuracies in this scrawl, which I write in a crowd of disputing Delegates. in the Library adjoining the Congress room.  I have the honor to be, with the greatest esteem & respect, Your Excellency's most obdt Servt, Thos Burke  ""

  Dear Col. Philadelphia April 15. 1777 Having given Col. Tayloe what little news is stiring here, which I know will be communicated to you; I have only to acknowlege the rect. of several of your favors, for which I am much obliged to you. Your sentimental description is in the hands of Mr. Towne the evening Printer.(1) He has not yet informed me whether he can print it; but I doubt he will be prevented by the many domestic occurrences. I think you are too severe upon the aspring of Popularity, tho I think it wants mending which I fear nothing will do effectually, but the self denying ordinance.  APRIL 15, 1777  Since my return here, I have again pushed Doctor Bond for the method of granulating Sugar, he has promised faithfully to procure it & I shall take care to remind him of his promise. He mentions a person in N. England who made sugar from the tops of the corn stalk, which yeilded him more profit, than all the rest of the corn.  We are threatened to be again driven from this City. It is very troublesome, & I think so disgracefull that I cou'd find in my heart to cut the figure in history, which you some time agoe mentioned, if we cou'd find the body of men; but strange to tell that is now our only want, tho in the long enumeration of wants which we have been used to make, that never entered into the catalogue. Mr. Howe is but in a poor condition, & yet he bullies us, however as there is little prospect of his being soon reinforced, I hope e'er long he will be obliged to look to his own safety, Proper regulations in the different departments are making, that if we ever get an Army, we shall keep it. Our accounts from London say the plan of operations for this campaign is for Howe to demolish the Eastern states, Burgoyne with 10,000 men is to conquer all that borders on Chesapeak while Carlton from Canada subjugates the [middle states?] (2) but most of the troops to effect all [this are to?] be procured & no man in Europe can tell from whence. Not from Russia, the Turk is likely to give her employment. God send, they may soon all get together by the ears, & then we shall be at rest. Our best compts. to Mr. Carter, his Lady & family. Health & happiness attend you my good friend. Francis Lightfoot Lee  ""

  My dear Sir, Philadelphia April 15. 1777 The Express who delivered me your favor of March the 28th last(1) and who went on to Jersey, has either forgotten his promise, or not returned, because he has never since called on me.  No person living detests more than I do, the pernicious practise of engrossing, especially the necessaries of life. Tis begotten by avarice or inhumanity, and deserves every kind of discouragement. I have spoken to Mr. Morris, and he declares, that so far as he has been concerned, his Agent was directed to purchase for him with view of foreign commerce solely. It must deeply concern every good Man to see our Army collect so slowly, by which instead of crushing the enemy before reenforcements arrive to them, we are still obliged to be on the defensive, having but 3000 APRIL 15, 1777  to oppose to near 8000. And now they threaten to attack this City, 9 ships of war being already in the Delaware. The Citizens however are in good spirits & say they shall not have the Town. In the mean time their land force remains in its old situation at Brunswick. Two, or three days ago, they made two sorties nearly at the same time, one party attacking our Post at Bon Brook, and another that at Quibble Town. The latter attack was immediately repulsed, but the former succeeded at first, so as to repel our Men & get away 3 field pieces. But a small reenforcement coming up, they were beaten in turn and driven off, leaving 7 dead on the Field. We lost 5 men. I strongly incline to think that they mean only to amuse us and divert our attention from forming an Army, until their succors enable them to take the field and pursue to advantage their original plan of possessing the North river, and joining with Gen. Carleton. Be their designs what they may, it is evidently the business of every State to exert itself for furnishing its Quota of Troops, that an Army formidable may be collected, and sufficient to oppose every attempt. We have now Arms and every other equipment ready for 20,000 Men and the Hospital department is put on the most liberal and judicious plan. Some of the best Medical Men on the Continent are called to act in it, so that we hope this business will now be managed in the best manner and the sick will be taken care of. A fine Ship from Nantes, with powder, arms, & Woolens was the other day chased on shore by two or three Frigates near the Capes of Delaware.(2) The Captain, after bravely defending himself for some time in vain, blowed up his Ship rather than let her fall into the enemies hands. He lost his life, the rest of the Crew was saved, and what is remarkable, a considerable part of the Cargo was driven safely on shore by the exploding effort of the powder, and persons are now employed in securing it. We have intelligence from London, via France, late in Jany., by which we learn that Bankruptcies go on well, two West India Merchants having failed for more than a million, and that the general distress was great. The Merchants tell the Ministry that they lost one million eight hundred thousand pounds sterling by the capture of their Vessels last year. The same accounts tell us that the practises at New York since the enemy got it, exceed everything described in History unless it be the proceedings of the second Triumvirate and give dreadful specimen of what is to be expected where power prevails. It is certain that the refusal of the India Company on account of difficulty and delay alone prevented the Villains from sending American prisoners to the East Indies for Slaves.(3) And that being refused, they were on the verge of sending such of them to Africa as were in England. Yet these are the Men, or Devils rather, that some among us would persuade submission to! For Heavens sake let every nerve be strained to expel them far from North America. They contaminate the Air they breathe. Excuse the length of this letter and believe me to be with affectionate respect, yours, Richard Henry Lee  ""

  Dear Brother Philadelphia April 15th 1777 I have for some time past been less punctual in writing to you than I intended, oweing first to the Small Pox, & then to my being detained three Weeks on my Way from Baltimore to this Place by my Wife's Sickness. I am sorry to hear the recruiting Business goes on slowly in APRIL 15, 1777  Virginia. It is the Case throughout the Continent. We have no Army hardly, on which Account we are loseing the most favourable Opportunity that could have offered, of destroying the Force which the Enemy now have in America. I wrote to you by Mr. Clarkson & then gave it as my Opinion, that the Enemy would not attack this City, but since that, several Pieces of Information have induced me to give up that Opinion. Indeed there is at this time a considerable Fleet in Delaware Bay, which has set every Body to work to prevent their coming up. If the Citizens would exert themselves, all would be safe: but Toryism, Fear & Avarice have totally obliterated every virtuous Principle. The General thinks that when they do attack Philaa. their land Army will cooperate with their Fleet, but that their present Design is only To cut off the Trade of this River. On Saturday last we lost a valuable Ship loaded with military stores & Cloathing from France. The Captn. fought nobly, & at last ran the Ship aground, & after putting the greater Part of the Crew, & his Papers on Shore, blew her up, but unfortunately he & six of his Crew perished by the Explosion, which happened by the Match burning too fast. A small Affair happened on Sunday Morning in the Jersey. The Enemy attempted with a considerable Party from Brunswick to surprize Genl. Lincoln at Bound Brook, which they had nearly effected oweing to the Negligence of a Militia Guard. We lost 2 field Pieces, & about twenty five Men, most of them Prisoners. The Genl. & his Men behaved well. The Enemy soon left the Town; they lost several Men.  We have Accounts from London by the way of France, dated early in Feby, that Burgoyne with ten thousand British & German Troops is to attack Virginia early in the Spring.....

  Sir Philadelphia April 16. 1777 It is difficult to ascertain with Precision the Designs of the Enemy: But by the best Intelligence We can obtain, their Malice and Revenge against New England, is implacable.  Their Intentions, most probably, are to come over the Lakes and enter N. England by that Way, to attack it by the Way of Rhode Island, and also by the Way of the North or the East River. An Armament may possibly be destined to Cheasapeak Bay by Way of Diversion.  The Surest Way to defend New England is to send along all your continental Troops to their Destinations at Fishkill and Ti.  Congress have this day passed a Resolution in the offensive Stile.(1) The Character of New England, is concerned in the Execution of it. I hope in God, that little Banditti of the Halt and blind in Rhode Island will be destroyed in all Events. If it cost us Thousands of Lives it ought to be done. But I believe by an Expedition prudently conducted, they may be driven off or made Prisoners without any considerable Loss. I am sir with great Respect, your most obt. Sert, John Adams  ""

  Sir, Philadelphia Apl. 16th. 1777 Inclosed is the Copy of an Extract from a Letter sent to our Commissioners in France the beginning of February, by a Gentleman in London, and by them transmitted to the Secret Committee.(1) As it touches our and the other New England States I thought it my Duty to obtain the Favour of a Copy of it, and to transmit it to you by the first Opportunity. It seems by a Letter from the Commissioners that it is a Part of the Plan of the Enemy for the ensuing Campaign to send out 10,000 Germans under Burgoyne to attack Virginia; but they doubt whether that Number can be procured.(2) In my humble Opinion they will not be able to collect a Force adequate to such various Operations. However if our Battalions should be completed before any Reinforcements arrive I think We need not fear what the Enemy can do unto Us. The recruiting Business is of the utmost Importance and I hope will be diligently attended to. Con- APRIL 16, 1777  gress hath passed some Resolves on that Head which the President will transmit to our as well as the other States.  It gives me great Pain when I reflect on the laying aside of the Expedition formed against the Enemy on Rhode-Island. Why, Sir, was that Design not executed? Was there not a sufficient Number of Troops collected for the Purpose? Or ? I know not what to attribute it to. I have shown the Assembly's Handbill to many Members. They highly approve the Spirit of the Assembly, and lamented that the Expedition had dropped. It is possible that a Recommendation may go from Congress to the State of Rhode-Island to undertake and with the Assistance of the neighbouring States execute the Destruction, Captivity or Expulsion of the Enemy in our State. I have repeatedly and perhaps oftner than became me mentioned the Necessity of giving them a home blow before they should be reinforced and while We had a Chance. It seems probable to me, if the Enemy intend to direct their Operations wholly & from all Sides against New-England that through our States, by our Bay, an Inroad will be attempted into it. This Consideration affords an additional strong Reason to what hath been suggested for a Descent on Rhode-Island, and increases my Wishes that such an Attempt may be made. The Idea of Carnage and Bloodshed is indeed shocking to Humanity, but the Road to Glory and Liberty hath been always sprinkled with human Blood. Genl. Howe is expected here soon. I hope We shall [be] prepared to give him a warm Reception. I was surprised to find by a Letter recd from G. Washington that B[rigadier] G[enerall Varnum had wrote him that no more than 364 Contl. Soldiers had inlisted the first of April, after having been told by some Gentn. from our State that more than double that Number were raised before that Time.(3) I don't mean to scruple the Truth of Mr. Varnum's Account; but to express by Grief and Astonishment at the dull Progress of the recruiting Service. If the Business goes on as slowly in the other States in N. England as in ours it will be late before We shall have a respectable Army in the Field; so late that We shall be exposed to Ravage & Devastation. Every Nerve ought to be strained and I hope will be strained to complete our Battalions. Please to inform your Delegates what Number of Men have inlisted in the Continental Battalions, and what in the 1 5th Months Service. what is the Number & State of the Enemy on Rhode-Island, and with the Doings of the Assembly at their late Sessions. Mr. Marchant is not yet arrived. I hope the Genl. Assembly will comply with my Request, and either reappoint me or chuse a new Delegate early in May Session for the Reasons assigned in former Letters; and that if the Honor of a Reappointment should be conferred upon Me I may have Leave to visit my Family.  I have desired John Collins Esqr. who will hand you this Letter, to collect & journalize every Species of Intelligence he can.

You have only to order them from Bristol to Head Quarters at your pleasure. The inclosures now sent are from France by the last Ship. The Memoir is written by one of the first Generals in France, or in Europe, purely from views of serving the American cause, which the Mareshal appears to love. The accounts from Nantes are taken from a letter of Doctr. Lee to the Secret Committee in his way from Paris to the Court of Madrid. I thought it might avail you to have the general idea therein given of the enemies views and designs the ensuing Campaign. In the letter signed by all the Commissioners, we learn that the capital operations will certainly be against New England, the exterpation of which is proposed, whilst military government & slavery is (as they think the milder punishment) intended for the middle and southern States.(2) Conversing lately with Mr. James Hunter of Fredericksburg, whose labors have benefitted the public greatly, I find APRIL 16, 1777  that the indispensable article of iron has been greatly affected, and its production injured, by the constant practise of inlisting the Laborers in those works, and pressing the Teams belonging to them. There are few things more capable of throwing distress among the people, and injuring the public affairs, than such a procedure.

Having been appointed to conferences with two of our Generals, Gates & Greene, some weeks ago, I had gained strong ideas that the Enemy was not in a capacity to move against this city, and that such a motion would be useless as well as dangerous, unless performed prior to the removal of provisions & stores from hence. The preparations making by the British army, now, have indeed the face of such an expedition, but have not abolished my ideas before mentioned. I suspect many appearances to be meer feints; and I am not so vainly fond of establishing a character of the truest political foresight as to he affraid to throw out an opinion which a short time may contradict. I do not believe Howe is coming to Philadelphia. Information from France of February the ] 11th confirms my former distrust of threats & Preparitives against this Capital. The plan of operation is said to be for Howe, when recruited, to act against New England; for Carleton to cross the lakes & keep the middle APRIL 16, 1777  Colons. in awe; for Burgoyne, who is to come from England with 10,000 men, if he can get them, to make an invasion upon Virginia & Maryland. Reports have gone from London to Paris that 10,000 Germans are actually engaged, but the French and Spanish Ministers give assurances that it is with the greatest difficulty that the British army can keep up their former number by recruits. It seems to our Agents certain they will make 3 attacks, and use their utmost efforts this campaign, as they cannot long be without employment nearer home. England, Ireland & Hanover are left defenceless by the efforts to turn all possible force against us. The French Minister told our friends that the King of England had tryed in vain to get troops to supply in Hanover the place of those sent from thence to Gibralter.  By letters of the 14th of Febry. from Doctr. Lee on his road to Madrid we are informed that commissions of marque are granting in England. The Press is most violent but without Proportionable produce. This together with the preparations of France & Spain makes peace, he says, impossible many months. He was of opinion, at the date of this last writing, that the Armaments against us would be late if Europe permits them at all. But he adds, it is best to prepare as if we had no dependance but upon ourselves, for the Politics of Europe are very wavering.(1)  It is just so, Sir, with the plans of the British General in America; therefore I cannot but earnestly wish there may [be] such an apprehension of a chance of his once more making an effort against our state, as to cause some tollerable preparation to withstand him till those troops in the middle Colonies which are amused by feints, should be able to give their assistance in New England.  The paper which I inclose tends to prove the necessity of having suitable magazines of Flour &c.(2) I fear the Enemy have taken much of what was expected by you from Maryland and Virginia.  Having, agreable to my duty, hinted my apprehensions about a sudden turn of the British troops towards New England, I shall fill the remaining paper with miscellaneous intelligence.  The British Government hath been so very maliciously abandoned as to make an offer to the East India Company to deliver the American prisoners to them if they would call for them at Gibralter. This Proposal is on record in the Company's books, and a General Court was actually held upon it.  Great Britain countenanced a settlement on the Mosqueto Shoar. The Spaniards routed the Setlers, and acquainted the British Ministry with the whole proceedings. Lord Weymouth is very desirous of avowing the countenance which was at first given, but others in power are for meanly Iying about it: whence misunderstanding has arisen in the ministry. And the Spaniard, finding it was not instantly disavowed as a public measure, has said he shall make a serious business of it, if the British Ministry are so disposed.   The Amphitrite is on her way with 52 four pounders and other useful articles, and two other vessels with a proportion of the same magazine, from whence the mentioned Peices had been shipped; which consisted at first of 200 of that Bore & 22 Mortiers with all their Atraille, and Powder Balls & Bombs.  Though a variety of reports may reach you about the insults offered by different Indians, yet, from the papers which have fallen within my sight in a necessary course, I can venture to assure that a war with them is not inevitable. They are outcast Banditti and not regular formidable Tribes which have done mischiefs. The latter profess friendship, and give very shrewd replys to British Sollicitors.  I ought to mention that our proceedings by Sea are counted the most detrimental to the British Ministry's Reputation. Our friends in France will be greatly chagrined at the present Embargo. I wish it was avoidable.  I have the honor to be with great Esteem, Sir, Your obliged very humb. Servt. James Lovell  [P.S.] I wish my Respects & Love presented to your Lady, Miss Bowdoin, your Grandaughter and Mr. Bowdoin.  ""

  Dear Sir Philadelphia April 16th. 1777. On the Intelligence received by Congress that nine of the Enemies Ships of War had got into Delaware Bay, and that a Number of Transports were seen in the offing, the Continental Troops in this City amounting to 563 Rank and File were ordered to Fort Island to assist in compleating the Fortifications there, which are in a very defenceless State, and to throw up a Work on Red Bank to prevent the Enemies taking possession and thereby forcing the vessels and Floating Batteries designed for the protection of the Chevaux de Frise from their Station. Your Excellency's Letter of the Instant was received this Morning and refered to me with an order to carry your Intentions into Execution. In obedience thereto I have ordered the Troops immediately to move to Bristol, where they will be joined by 250 Virginians just arrived.(1)  All the Military Stores belonging to the Public are ordered out of Town and the Quantity now left in it is very inconsiderable.(2)  I advised Congress that I had been informed that very considerable Quantities of provisions and other Stores that might be greatly serviceable to the Enemy were collected by private persons, in Consequence of which persons are appointed by the Board of War of this State to take an exact account of them. Considerable progress has been made in the Business, and the Result has shewn that the Information was just,  APRIL 17, 1777  and Matters are put in such a Train as that we shall to Morrow Morning begin to move those Stores.(3)  Directions are given for building the Boats your Excellency mentions.

  My dear Sir Philade. April 17. 1777 I should before this time have acknowledgd your Favors of the 2d & 24th of Feb. had I not constantly been in the Situation which you represent to be yours, in your last of the 2d of April.(1) \""Something or other has always taken Place to call me off.\"" We have for some time past been threatned with an Invasion by Sea, and the last Accounts receivd from the Capes say, there are nine of the Enemies Ships of War within the River. I inclose this days paper which gives an Account of the Misfortune of the Ship Morris & other Intelligence.(2) By the last Letters from France dated in February we are informd that a War is inevitable, and that our Affairs there still wear a favorable Aspect. My worthy Friend Dr L. [Arthur Lee] who, you have heard, is got to Paris, writes to me in these Words, \""The Politicks in Europe depend on too many Whims and Refinements for us to hazard the downright Defence of every thing dear to us upon them. It is well to cultivate Europe but not to depend upon it.\"" He speaks my Sentiments, and, I believe, yours. I have been always of opinion, that we must depend upon our own Efforts, under God for the Establishment of our Liberties. When it suits the Interest of foreign Powers they will aid us substantially. That some of them will find it their Interest to aid us I can hardly doubt but there seems not to be Virtue enough left in the World, from generous and disinterested Motives to interpose in Support of the Common Rights of Mankind. We are told that fresh Disputes have arisen between Russia and the Turks, and a Quarrel is likely to ensue. France and Spain are preparing mighty Fleets, to consist of 30 Sail of the Line each & to be ready for the Sea the first of March.  APRIL 17, 1777  The Merchants of Britain in a Memorial laid before Ld Sandwich reckon their Losses by the Captures our Privateers have made on their W. India Trade to be 21,800,000. Insurance had arisen to 28 per Cent & Bankruptcys had taken place. There is no kind of Relaxation here, says a London Correspondent, in Warlike Preparations, and yet the Ministry have so contrivd it, that but few People beleive there is any Danger of War. I am much puzzled, says he, about the real Intention in Respect of these great & hasty Armaments; they are certainly too expensive to be mere Scarecrow, and improbable as on one Account it seems, there is Reason to beleive they intend, when their present Loan is compleated, either to attack France, or at least to hold very high Language to her. Certain it is, that Ld Weymouth has of late seriously & warmly urgd an immediate Declaration of War with France, and tho' such Declaration has not been made, it is perhaps only suspended. With Regard to America we are informd, that Transports were getting ready to bring out the additional British & Hessian Troops & it was intended they should all sail by the beginning of March. The Campaign is to be opend unusually early and the operations directed wholly and from all sides against New England, that by early and vigorous Exertions they may crush the Northern Colonies. I think I have given this to you and my other Friends as my opinion in my Letters the last Winter. If they can subdue those stubborn States they flatter themselves the rest will submit. It is necessary that New England should sustain her Character and Firmness. Their Intention is to extirpate the People there and make Slaves of the Rest of America. I wish the Nest of Hornets on Rhode Island had been before now destroyed. I expected it would have been done. I have been informd of the Reason why it was not done. The Congress have now recommended it to the States of M. B., C., & N.H. to call forth their Militia for that Purpose and have directed Genl Washington to send a suitable officer to take the Command. I hope it will now be done. It is certainly wise to conquer our Enemies in Detail before their Reinforcements can arrive. I fear N E will be chargd with the Loss of her former military Pride if it is not done. I have been sanguine in urging it here, and have almost pawnd my Reputation on the Success of the Undertaking as well as the Valor of my Countrymen. I wish for more of an enterprizing Spirit, and shall feel my self happy in the Revival of such a Spirit in New England.  Capt Collins who will deliver this Letter is now ready to set off and waits. Adieu my Friend. I will speak to Genl Mifflin again who is now here about Mr Temples Affair.(3) I am glad to hear of the brisk Sale of Lottery Ticketts in Boston & that the Loan office is successfull.(4) I hope Boston will be made as strong as Gibralter. Our 15 Battalions may be completed. I am pleasd with the Measures you are taking with the Tories. Dont let the Execution of the good Law be abated an Iota in a single Instance. If they take the oath, you must nevertheless keep a   watchful Eye over them. They are a cursed Generation. We are plagud with them here beyond bearing.  ""

3551,dg006567,1777,William Duer to the New York Convention,"""William Duer to the New York Convention
  Sir, Philadelphia, April 17th, 1777. I should have done myself the honor of writing to you immediately after my arrival, but have been so occupied by various business the whole Time I have been here that I have not had time to write on the different Matters relative to the State of New York and now before Congress.  I am extremely concerned to inform you that there is no prospect at present of our obtaining a supply of Salt from the Continental magazines, there being only 1200 Bushels in store at this place.  I have requested Mr. Robert Morris to inform me whenever any salt is to be exposed to sale, and should the other Gentleman who represent our State concur in opinion, I will employ a person to purchase, in Behalf of the State, on the most reasonable Terms possible.  The Letter from the Convention relative to the Insurgents in the North Eastern parts of the State transmitted to Mr. Lewis Morris before my arrival, has been read in Congress; but as I expected daily the arrival of Mr. Duane and Mr. Livingston, I thought it most prudent to get the consideration postponed, to which Congress acceded.  The deputies from New Connecticut are now in town, and have presented to Congress a memorial, a copy of which I shall do myself the honor to transmit you in a day or two. I can by no means think that this attempt to dismember our State will be countenanced by Congress, tho', I am sorry to say, that I can very easily perceive that Individuals from the Eastern States mean to support Messrs. Allens in their extravagant Pretensions. I flatter myself however, that with the Assistance of my colleagues, I shall procure such Resolutions passed as will reprobate their Proceedings and oblige the revolted Subjects to render a due Obedience to the laws of the State.(1)  I am extremely sorry to inform you, that notwithstanding the Invasion which threatens this city, a Langour prevails amongst the Inhabitants of APRIL 17, 1777  almost all Ranks. The Disputes about their constitution and a want of vigilance & vigour in detecting and defeating the Designs of the disaffected have given the Malignants a dangerous ascendency. The depreciation of the Continental Money is astonishingly rapid, and I see with Concern that no attempts are made to check so fatal a measure. You will observe by the inclosed resolutions of Congress of the 14th & 15th April that they have been under the necessity of supplying an executive authority in this State.(2) By the recess of the Supreme Executive Council there was an absolute interregnum, and if Congress had not interposed, this State would have fallen an easy prey to a very small body of the enemy's army. It is to be hoped however, that the authority now established will exert itself with vigour, and that a little Quackery will save a powerful State, which must have fallen a sacrafice to a speculative system of politicks.  At the Request of Major General Schuyler, I transmit you Extracts of two letters, which he has lately received from which you will learn with Sorrow, that our Strength at Tyconderoga is totally inadequate to resist any attempt of the Enemys army; at least it appears so to me, notwithstanding the sanguine Expectations which Colonel Wayne entertains that he should be able to maintain the Garrison, till Succours could arrive.  By a Return sent to the General on the 1st of April, it appears that there are only 685 men fit for Duty at that post, including 120 artificers, & exclusive of 73 Matrosses fit for duty. The General does not think that any Reinforcement has yet arrived there. I thought it my duty to transmit this Intelligence, as the fate of our State is so intimately connected with the preservation of that fortress.  The slow progress made in the reemiting business, notwithstanding the favorable accounts which were at first circulated, has at length roused Congress, and they have entered into sundry resolutions for compleating the battalions, which I have the Honor to transmit.(3)It is with pleasure that I consider that the State to which I have the Honor to belong, has pointed out to Congress the most eligible and effectual mode of completing the army. Would to Heaven that the Spirit and activity which has of late animated the Councils of the State of New York would diffuse itself throughout the other States! A portion of their Electrical fire is certainly wanting. Without it, should the enemy receive a timely Reinforcement, and show the least Spirit of Enterprise, our affairs must inevitably suffer.  I have the pleasure to assure the Convention that the State of New York stands in very high point of light in the Eyes of the Continent, and that General Washington in his public letters to Congress gives the most honorable testimonials in its Favor.(4) These, Sir, are the happy effects of our unanimity and vigour. May their influence continue to pervade our councils. Whatever may be our fate, the leaders in public measures in our State will then have the consolation to think that no misfortunes which in the course of political events may happen, can be justly imputed to them.   I have in my I lands about 21200 belonging to the State, which I beg to know whether I shall remit or keep in Bank, in hopes of making a purchase of salt. Whatever directions I may receive shall be faithfully complied with.  Mr. Duane and Mr. Livingston who arrived here yesterday, desire me to tender their respects to the Convention.  I have the honor to be, with every Sentiment of Esteem & Respect, Sir, Your obedt. hble Servant, Wm. Duer.  ""

  Sir Philadelphia April 17th. 1777 Congress is desirous if possible to Subdue the Enemy that are in this Country before a reinforcement can arrive. The Small pox has greatly retarded the recruits Joyning the Army. We had information Some time ago that preparations were making to attack the Enemy on Rhode Island  APRIL 17, 1777  & dislodge them. Why it has not been executed we have not been informed. A resolution passed Yesterday recommending to the State of Rhode Island to raise its whole force, to the Massachusetts & Connecticut States, to raise their militia in the neighbourhood of Rhode Island, to attack the Enemy, & have directed General Washington to order a Suitable continental General officer to Command there.(1) The President has Sent copies of the resolution to the Several States concerned. Enclosed are resolutions to forward the recruiting Service, & some alterations of the Articles for the government of the Army.(2) The Enclosed News Paper contains a list of Surgeons & Physicians appointed for the Hospitals,(3) among whom is Doctr.

Your Honr will have a copy of the regulations of the Hospitals & the Pay of the persons to be Employed in the public Papers.

  Sir,(1) Philadelphia 17t April 1777 Your known Love of your Country renders any Apology for my Writing to you upon any Matters wherein its Happiness may be affected altogether unnecessary. I shall therefore Sir, take the Liberty to acquaint you, that our latest Accounts from Europe from those who We Ought most to depend upon are that the Plan of Operations for the Next Cam- APRIL 17, 1777  paign is for Howe and his Army with such Recruits as he can get and shall be sent to him to Act against N. England, while Car[l]eton makes his Way through the Lakes, to keep the Middle Colonies in Awe, and Burgone with an Armament from England of Ten Thousand if they can be procured, invades the South, probably Virginia and Maryland. That it is given out in England that Ten Thousand Germans are already actually engaged, but that the better and more probable Account is, that it will be Very difficult for G. Britain to procure more of these People than will be necessary to keep up the Numbers formerly stipulated, and that their Armaments will most certainly fall much short of what they intended, and that such as they do send will not only come late if the Affairs of Europe shall permit them to come at all, but that the Troops both from England and Germany will be such as are new raised and consequently totally undeciplined. That it has not been in the Power of G. Britain to procure Troops in Germany to supply the Place of those which they had sent from Hanover to Gibralter. That England, Ireland and Hanover are almost intirely defenceless on Account of the Troops already sent from thence to this Country. They farthar say that the Losses which the West India Trade suffered the last Year, which their Merchants in their Petition to the Admiralty say Amounted to One Million Eight hundred Sterling has determined the British Government to Send out a Number of Armed Cutters to take our small Cruizers. That the West Indiamen will in future be Armed as is usual in Time of War. That in Consequence of their Losses Insurance was 28 per Cent. And that Nothing had given such Surprize thro Europe as the Success of our privateering Business. That a Bill to grant Letters of Mark was passing in Parliament and that the Press for Seamen continued Very Violent tho' not equally productive as it had been! which together with the great Preparations in France and Spain with the sure Protection which our Ships received in their Ports, forbid every Expectation that Peace would continue long between those Powers. Some other matters mentioned likewise confirm these Expectations. That fresh Disputes have begun between the Courts of Constantinople & Petersbourgh which would probably rekindle the Flame of War in that Quarter. Our Freinds advice us that if G Britain does not succeed in her Veiws of Subduing us this year, her Prospects must be at an End. That therefore We should be prepared to meet fresh Forces, should [they] be sent against us, with proportionable Exertion on our part. That tho' it is highly probable that G Britain may Soon find Employment nearer Home, yet to be in the best Condition is to be in the State of the best Defence. That the conduct of States as well as Individuals is not always governed by Interest but are sometimes influenced by a triffling Contingency. That in a matter so consequential nothing ought to be left to Chance which can be avoided.  This is sir the Substance of What News &c I tho't it might be proper for me to Acquaint you with.   That the British Administration are inflamed with the Strongest Passions of Pride, Avarice and Revenge is what We have no Reason to doubt of and that they will put every Thing to the most desperate Hazard rathar than fail of accomplishing their Wishes, which is it seems is the utter Destruction of the N. England Countrys and Subjecting the Rest to a military Goverment. If they were not most strongly impressed with these Passions they would pay more Regard to the Voice of Opposition in their own country which is so Very loud, and to the Increasing Bankruptcies which have lately greatly multiplied amongst them, and to the Threatening Aspect of their Neighbours Circumstances, which a People not totally infatuated, would Veiw as portending the most direfull Consequences. A circumstance of the Ferocity of the British Court may be learnt from their offering to deliver the Prisoners taken on Long Island to the East India Company to be sent to their settlements, in Case they would send to Gibralter for them. This Proposition We have an Authentick Account of, was Recorded in the Compy Book and that the Genl. Assembly met to consider of the Offer. This Shews the extreme Malice of that Goverment. But God Reigns and Will I believe Blast the Designs of these unrelenting Tyrants.  That N England will be a principal object with the Enemy the next Campaign I think not only Probable because their Malice would dictate such a Measure, but they must feel the necessity of bringing the War to a speedy Close which they will not consider as affected in any very considerable Degree while the N England Countrys are unsubdued.  The Enemy have put on an Appearance as tho they intend an Expedition to this City which occasions the Removal of Stores &c, also an order to the Militia to be ready in Case of Emergency, and a direction to form a Camp near the City to which they may repair and join the continental troops. These Steps are doubtless Well, but Whatever the present Veiws of the Enemy may be, their final object I apprehend is Hudsons River and the Eastward.  You will sir kindly accept my most sincere Wishes for your Happiness and be assured that I am with Sentiment of esteem, your most Obedient humble Servant, Oliver Wolcott.  P.S. I should have mentioned to you Sir that the Committee from N York and Virginia inclusive who met as you have doubtless heard to Consider of the expediancy of fixing Prices &c similar to what was done in N England are dissolved without doing any Thing.(2) It may therefore be an object worthy of Consideration wheither We ought to Continue our Embargo Law respecting Prices &c.  The Policy and even Practicability of the Measure has been denyed here. How this is I believe the N England Goverments by this Time have had the full Information of Experience to convince them. But if We sell and restrain our Trade in a lower and more confined Way than our Neighbours We cannot be upon an equal footing with them. APRIL 18, 1777  ""

  Sir April 18th 1777 The Navy Board of this State having requested the assistance of the Continental Navy in defending the Cape May Channel in Delaware Bay so that the inward and outward bound Trade may not be totally obstructed by the enemies ships stationed at the mouth of said Bay,  The Brigantine Andrea Doria being now ready for service you are forthwith to proceed down the Cape May Channel and Co-operate with the two Gallies sent down by the said Navy Board the Commanders of which will be instructed to Consult with and be directed by you in pursuing such measures as may be necessary to secure and defend the said Channel as well as in any attempt you may think it proper and prudent to make on such of the enemies Tenders and Vessels as you may judge your force equal to Cope with, and you will exert your utmost abilities and address, to take, sink, burn or otherwise destroy, any or all of their Cruizers you meet with.  You will particularly attend to the business of protecting our Trade and procuring any American Vessels inward or outward bound to which you can extend protection or assistance. The Gallies of this state whilst acting in conjunction with you will be subject to your orders. They draw little water and have heavy Canon in their Bows which induces us to think they might be very successfully employed in mollesting and galling the enemies larger Ships Iying at Anchor in the Road or any part of the Bay especially by attacking them in the Night. The Gallies might run into shoal water on the shoals nearest to where the ships anchored and take such a Station that the large ships could not get near them, bring the Bow Guns to bear on the Enemy and keep Up a Constant fireing until they obliged them to weigh Anchor or slip their Cables. Calm weather will be the best for this sort of business, because the enemies ships would remain unrnanageable and the Gallies could Row and do what they pleased. If attacks of this kind are frequently made and with success they will get tired of Anchoring and prefer keeping the sea which will give our vessels a better chance of geting in and out. We would like to have this plan attempted and think you would do well to go in one of the Gallies on the first Occasion taking care not to disgust the Captain of her thereby, but you will be the better able to judge what  APRIL 18, 1777  can be done afterwards. When you find the service herein recommended does not require your particular attention, either by means of your taking or destroying the enemies Tenders or by their quitting the Station. you may then deem these orders to be fully complyed with and opening the others given you herewith proceed as therein directed. And as you have a valuable Cargo on board you will during this service be particularly attentive to the safety of the Andrea Doria and her Cargo, only exposing her to danger when you are sensible the true Interest or honor of America requires it.  We are sir, Your hble servants ""

In Congress your name has never been mentioned but as their Officer in general terms with others. Your enemys have not dared to impeach you before that August Assembly yet; and I believe never will.

  My dear Sirs Philad l9th April 1777  We 1 arrivd in this City on Wednesday afternoon. If you talk seriously to its Inhabitants you'l find them full of the Expectation of a Visit from Genl Howe; examine their Conduct and the Appearance of everything about you, & you cannot but conclude that they are in a State of the most perfect Tranquility and Security. Talk to them about the scandalous depreciation of the continental and other paper money: and the extravagant Prices of all Commodities, they may go so far as to express their Concern: but they affect to consider it as an immediate misfortune and nothing is farther from their thoughts than to provide a plan for reformation. Their supreme executive have adjournd themselves for a month. Executive adjournd, say you, how is that possible? Sirs they have adjournd; not for  APRIL 19, 1777  want of Business, for surely no Country ever cried more loudly for a vigilant, active and decisive Government. They have adjournd because- faith I cannot tell you why-perhaps for the want of authority to save their Country under their new Constitution-perhaps for want of Resolution to exercise the powers they have. Under these Circumstances, the civil Governours having in effect abdicated for a month, Congress have interposd and supplied an executive as you'l observe by the Resolution enclosd.(2) With the free consent of the sleeping executive, Congress might have taken the whole power of the State into their Hands and provided for it's Safety as they pleasd. It is evident that this same supreme executive are under apprehensions that must encumber and defeat all Business. They must not make themselves Odious! The People may not be satisfied with such a Measure! They wish Congress woud direct what they think best! They will chearfully submit every thing to our superior wisdom, &c. &c. I am of Opinion that Congress will recommend the Revival of the Committees of Inspection &c as essential to the Salvation of the State. It is truly the only System which can give sufficient Vigour, Unanimity and Stability to publick Measures. These refined Speculative Plans may amuse; in times of peace they may produce Happiness; but flagrante bello they afford no Hope of Success, no Prospect of Advantage.  The Reputation of our State stands high tho' on the floor we are surrounded with Strangers. This is an evil which will be cured by good manners and sociability. It is in our power to be civil, as we keep House, and shall always have company when we dine at Home. I say we keep House, as we have taken a boarding House for our exclusive use.  We have got a Committee appointed of one member from each State to examine into General Schuyler's Conduct, but not without great difficulty and objections from our neighbours. It was pretended that there was no Complaint against him, no accusor & that therefore an Enquiry was absurd. This subtle Evasion did not pass. I am confident that Schuyler will be acquitted with Honour.(3)  Doctor Young formerly of our State has published an address to our Mountaineers advising them to be firm in their Revolt; and expressly assuring them that this is the opinion & wish of many leading members of Congress. (4) Col. Floyd informd us that he had not been able, tho' he livd with Roger Sherman, to make the least discovery of such a disposition.

In this visit you will be attended by Mr. John Dupuy, Merchant at that place to whom you will deliver the letter given you herewith (1) and the Cargo being consigned to this Gentleman you are to deliver the same to him immediately and if this Gentleman has on hand any goods or Stores belonging to the Public, say the united states he will put the whole or as many as you can conveniently take in on board the Surprize for which you must grant bills of Lading and then proceed back to the first safe port you can get into in these united states preferring this part of the Coast if equally safe. You are to land the stores and goods wherever you arrive giving us notice thereof and employing proper Persons to take charge of them until we can direct how they are to be disposed of. We think there is sufficient water for the Surprize in Egg Harbour, several of the Inlets southern of Cape Henlopen, and in several inlets of North Carolina & probably this may be safer than the great Bays. You will be careful to keep your men on board wherever you go and take in three or four Months Provisions. We hope this business will be finished before the first day of July.

You many send your prizes into the French Ports. Mr. John Dupuy will transact your business faithfully at the Mole as will Mr. Stephen Ceronio at the Cape Francois and these Gentlemen will also supply you with every thing wanting for the Service of the Sloop. You may order them to sell all perishable Prize Goods or those particularly suited to the West India Markets taking care they are actually prize agreeable to resolves of Congress, but the Vessels and other parts of the Cargoes must come to some American Port for Condemnation.

  My Dear Sir, Philadelphia 19th April 1777. Your favor of 31st ultimo is now before me. In conformity to your request I shall endeavor to get a draft on the Loan Office. I had that object in view when I desired you in some of my former letters to keep me advised of the state of that Office. I have never heard yet, even whether a Loan Officer is appointed, nor has Congress been informed that the resolutions for the establishment of Offices were ever rec'd in New Hampshire. In short the President complains generally that the receipt of his public letters to New Hampshire are never acknowledged. I give you this hint that you may endeavor to have this neglect rectified. It gives me pleasure to hear that the tickets go off so well. I hope fortune will smile on those who purchase on patriotic principles. APRIL 19, 1777  You no doubt are justifiable in delivering the arms, as to the clothing, you'll receive directions from the Clothier General. I shall pay the earliest attention to what you say respecting Roache's ship. If there is a probability of getting cannon from the Massachusetts furnace I think it best to stick close to them as the surest way of obtaining cannon for the Raleigh. The bursting of a few, I hope will not discourage the furnace from going on-not more than half those cast in the furnaces this way have stood the proof. This city is still threatened with an invasion but whether the threats will be executed or not, is a matter of doubt with me. A plan of correspondence between this City and the enemy has lately been discovered. 7 or 8 of the Traitors are under close confinement. Some of them will no doubt be hanged. This is disagreeable business, but if we dont hang them they'll hang us, and self preservation, you know, is the first law of nature. A considerable quantity of the goods will be saved from the ship blown up near the Capes, as mentioned in my last. She had a valuable cargo on board 400 lbs. of powder, 2500 stand of arms and a considerable quantity dry goods amounting in the whole to 250,000 livres for account of the public besides private property to a large amount-but the greatest loss is the life of the Captain whose bravery on this occasion is without example.  The establishment of a Navy Board in the Eastern Department is now in contemplation and I imagine will soon be done.(1) This is a necessary measure and ought to have been adopted some time ago. I am much at a loss for proper men to compose this Board. Boston, I suppose will be the place of their sitting; therefore it's probable they will be of that town, or neighborhood. My only wish is, that they may be good men. He is my choice who will best serve my country. Some gentlemen are very urgent that I would engage in this business, but it's totally against my principles to accept an office of profit created by a Legislative Body of which I am a member and to resign my seat from lucrative views would not only be treating honor done me by my constituents with indecency but be inconsistent with that patriotic delicacy, which ever affords the most agreeable reflections. These are my present sentiments nor do I by any means think I shall relinquish them. Whoever are appointed, I suppose must reside chiefly at Boston.  I wish we could have a public furnace for casting cannon set up in New Hampshire. I think I have heard that there is a large quantity of ore at Barrington and a convenient place for this business. I wish you would make inquiry about it and inform me what the ore can be purchased for, what distance it is from a convenient place for a furnace and the distance the latter is from water carriage.  I hope you will send some body to relieve me soon, as it will be very disagreeable to go a long journey in the heat of summer. My Colleague sets out in about a fortnight when I shall be left alone for New Hampshire and you know how hard the service will be then. In full confidence   that you use the utmost influence to have me relieved, I am your Sincere friend &c, Wm Whipple  23d. Since writing the foregoing, have rec'd your's by Capt Thompson who will set out in a few days. By him I shall write you fully if I can.  ""

  My Dear Bror, Philadelphia 19 Apl 1777 Yours of 31st Ulto is now before me, I hope to make a good use of the information therein given me respecting Masts, & shall be glad of further light on the subject, which you give me incouragement to hope for. All the Musquets imported from France have small bores but they are such as are use'd in the French Army, it is to [be] wish'd they were larger but if they are well handled they'll answer the Purpose. The Enemies Cruisers are very thick on this coast, & take many of our vessels, I mean Merchantmen. I wish the two Schooners you sent to Baltimore may escape, one of them sail'd some time ago, the other I expect is gone before this time.  This City is Still threatened with an invasion, but I am of opinion the Enemy will not put their threats in Execution. They certainly will not give up their grand scheme of forming a conjunction of their two Armies, if they shod send part of their Army this way, they will be so divided as to become an easy pray to us, provided our troops behave with a spirit becoming Americans, & they certainly can have no prospect of any considerable reinforcement from Europe, as by all accounts from thence there will be full employ for all the troops that can be rais'd there. The post at Ticonderoga is still very weak, by the last returns from thence, there was no more than 136 Rank & file of Col. Longs Regt. What can this mean? There was no other N.H. Troops there the 1st inst., except about 50 of Starks. I am really surpris'd that there shod be such delays at this Critical juncture, if greater exertions are not use'd there is great danger that the Enemy will make an impression on that part of the Country which will certainly be attended with very evil consequences, tho' even in that case I shall by no means think the Cause lost, for in my Opinion New England alone are able to Support their Freedom. However, I flatter myself we shall not be put to the Trial, for there is not the least probability that Britain will be able to support the Contest another Year, if we only keep her where she is this Year.  The accots from Our Commissioners are not so perticular as I could wish. The reason given is that they don't like to trust them in Merchant APRIL 19, 1777  Ships as there has been some instances of the Masters carelessness of their letters when they have been taken, but we very soon expect a packet, when I flatter myself shall be able to give you some joyful Tidings. Prizes taken by American Vessels are freely sold in France, the inclos'd Copy of a letter from a Gentn. who is never mistaken in his intelligence will shew you the scituation of the Court of Spain with that of England.(1) A fresh quarrel is breaking out between the Turks and Russians, all these things Auger well for America. Your Most effecte. Brother, Wm Whipple  23d This was to have gone by a private hand which I unluckely missed. I have now to acknowledge the receipt of Yours by Mr. Jackson and also the 17 per Post which I have not time at present to reply fully to.

  My dear Brother, Philadelphia April 20th 1777 It gave me inexpressible pleasure to find by your joint letter from Paris to Congress that you were safely arrived in France. As well on your own account I was rejoiced, as on that of my Country, well knowing with what zeal and ability the cause of America and of mankind will be served by you. Heaven grant you may be as successful in your negotiations as you wish to be and as the greatest and most virtuous cause that the sun ever shone on deserves. That the exertions of America will be firm, and great as are in her power, you may rely upon with absolute confidence, but then it ought not to be forgotten by those who wish our eternal seperations from Great Britain, that the single strength of North America opposed APRIL 20, 1777  to the united force of Great Britain and her Allies may prove an unequal contest, and should not be trusted too far. The difficulty of finding funds whilst our Trade is shut up by a superior marine strength, is very distressing and would find present relief, if the United Fleets of Spain & France were to fall on that of G.B. in its present state of inferiority. It amazes me that the Politicians of these two Kingdoms do not see with what certainty they may, in conjunction with N. America humble the pride and power of Britain, as well as that if the latter accomplish their plan of subjugating America, the force of both must & will be apylied to attack the American possessions of the House of Bourbon. It is now in the power of Spain, with ease to get the Harbor of Pensacola for her homeward bound Ships, and surely the power of Great Britain & N. America divided can never be so dangerous to her as when united, abstracted from the consideration of gratitude that must bind to her the affection of virtuous young republics for timely and effectual aid afforded them in the day of their distress. It will be very long before such kindness will be forgotten. Since the 24th of December, we have been in a constant train of success against the enemy, and from that time, during the whole winters Campaign, for it has never stopt, we have reduced the enemies force at least 4000 men. They have been confined to the Hills of Brunswick in New Jersey the whole winter, and there they remain now, their foraging parties have been so beaten and driven back that their distress has been great & their horses have died in numbers. And this has been done chiefly by Militia, our regular Army having been dispersed last fall in consequence of short enlistments which had taken place in Spring 1776 in the uncertain State that our affairs were then under. The Levies for forming a new regular Army for duration are now moving up to Head Quarters in Jersey from all the States, and an Army is forming at Ticonderoga ready to meet Gen Carleton as soon as the ice permits him to cross Lake Champlain. But we are greatly retarded by the necessity we are under of passing all our Troops thro inoculation before they join the Army. And this I fear will prevent us from taking advantage of the enemies weakness and presumption in remaining where they are before they get reinforced. Brunswick (on the hills near which the enemy are fortified) is in New Jersey upon the river Rareton which communicates with the Sea at Amboy near New York. The Rareton is not navigable for ships, but for small Craft, and it is about 12 miles from Brunswick to Amboy, so that you find they keep pretty nigh to their Ships. What a fine stroke it would be for a Spanish Fleet to remove their small Ships of War, which would effectually deliver their Army into our hands. And it would not quickly be in the power of England to recover this blow. Except two, the other States have fixed, and are exercising their new Governments which you may well suppose must add greatly to our force, safety,   and success. We have 13 Frigates nearly finished and some of them at Sea. Our Privateers you know have been very successful and still continue to be so. You cannot imagine what universal joy and spirit it would give to North America if Spain and France were now to Attack Great Britain. The success wd. be infallible, and the independence of America immoveably fixed.  Before this reaches you, the former dispatches will be arrived, by which you will see that Congress had proposed Doctor Franklin to attend the Court of Spain whilst you remained at Paris, but I suppose you have jointly considered that it may do as well for you to be at Madrid, and perhaps the Doctors age might render it inconvenient for him to travel so far. However, proper powers have long since been sent to Doctor Franklin appointing him to the Court of Spain altho he is not deprived of right still to represent these States at the Court of France.(1)  My obligation to you will never cease for taking care of my dear boys. But heaven knows what I shall do about making remittance whilst our Trade continues so obstructed by British Cruisers. Almost all the Frigates & Sloops of England are now employed against us. I have written to our brother,(2) who I expect will be in France by the time this reaches there, proposing if possible, that Thom should be employed as his Clerk or Secretary whilst he remains in France, and that Ludwell be instructed in Military matters, but more especially eloquence, and the principles of Natural law, that he may here turn either to War or to the Law. But if this cannot be done, that they be both sent to me by the first of our Vessels of War that come to this Country. My wish, and my earnest wish, is, to put them both in a situation to be of service to their country, and beneficial to themselves, but since the times admit not of remittances being made, that one of them, or both, as the case may be, that cannot be somehow employed in France so as to get a subsistence, I would have sent to me by the first of our Vessels that is most likely to bring him safely. By ours, I do not mean Virginia Vessels, for you know our trade used to be carried on, almost entirely, in British Bottoms, so that few if any Ships from Virga. will for some time be sent to France; which renders it of great importance indeed to both Countries that the latter should force her Trade with the former thro the British Cruizers. It would benefit both amazingly, and every assistance will be given on our part.(3)  ""

  Sir, Philadelphia, April 21st, 1777. We yesterday moved for a Copy of the Representation from our revolted Subjects to Congress.(1) A Member from the Massachusetts would have made it a Condition that a copy of your Remonstrance should be delivered to him, for the use of the Revolters, insisting that we and they were perfectly on an equal Footing, stating us the parties &c. This brought on some altercation, not to the Advantage of this open and avowed Advocates for the disturbers of the public peace and general union. In the Conclusion, the paper we moved for was ordered to be delivered.(2) On our parts we assured the House that tho' we should not suffer the State of New York to be put on a level with a small part of its disaffected Subjects, yet we had no Secret on this occasion: that any Member had our free Consent to take a Copy, and make such use of it as he might think proper. Here it ended.  We have obtained and transmit a copy of a printed address from Doctor Young to the insurgents in our State, in which he positively asserts that he has taken the Minds of several of the leading Members of Congress, and then proceeds to give them their advice. This paper, corresponding with the Hints we had from the Committee sent into Cumberland, renders it unnecessary to trouble you about further proof. Doctor Young is on the Spot; if he has injured his Friends they have the Means of ample Satisfaction, for they can call him before the House. However. we do not observe that the Imputation gives any Uneasiness to the suspected Members, tho' u e are well assured it has made strong Impressions to their Disadvantage on the Minds of other gentlemen. What Notice Convention ought to take of this insolent Address does not lie with us to determine; nor have we yet concluded on the part we shall pursue in Congress. It is our Business to move deliberately, as from the Change of Members we find ourselves surrounded with Strangers. To cultivate their Esteem and good opinion is of moment, considering the unfriendly views of some States and the magnitude of the business committed to our Charge. A Committee consisting of one member from each State. is appointed to examine into the Conduct of General Schuyler.(3) It was not done without warm opposition. There was no accuser, no Complaint, no Charge against the General. Nothing had ever been said to his disadvantage or dishonour in that House. Directing the inquiry was an implied Censure, or at least an indication of Suspicion, which should be avoided. These were the arguments against the appointment of a Committee. A single Remark was sufficient to refute them. If the General had done his Duty faithfully, why was his authority pared away to Nothing, and the Command of the Army, in Effect, transferred from him to  APRIL 21, 1777  General Gates, a Junior officer? We can entertain no Apprehension, but that the General will be honourably acquitted, tho' it is obvious enough that pains have been taken to injure his Character.  The feeble, inactive Condition of Pennsylvania is a sad proof how little their new Constitution is calculated for Security or Defense in time of Danger. Their executive Authority appears to be sensible of their weakness and lean with their whole weight upon Congress, who have found it necessary to recommend a temporary system to prevent the Ruin of the Cause, as far as it is connected with this State; to this will be added a Recommendation to revive the general Committees, for Nothing can be substituted in the place of this Institution equally salutary, or which can produce so much Union, Energy and Vigour.(4) The Spirit of the Legislature under the new Constitution here is strongly marked in their Militia Act, which provides that if a Colonel or other officer shall strike a Soldier while upon Duty, he shall forfeit a Sum not less than five nor more than ten pounds, but if the soldier shall strike or draw upon his Colonel or other officer while on duty he shall be fined a sum-not exceeding £5 !  We beg Leave to assure you Sir, that we shall exert our most zealous Endeavors for the Interest and Honor of our State on every occasion: and it gives us singular pleasure that your honorable Body maintain a high rank in the Estimation of Congress, as well as of the General and army, which cannot but greatly contribute to our Success in every just and reasonable Measure. We have the Honor to be with the utmost regard, sir, Your most obedient, humble servants, Phil Livingston  Jas. Duane Wm. Duer ""

  Dear Brother Philadelphia, April 21st. 1777 In your Letter you mention that you seldom hear from your Friends in Congress. The Fault I assure you lays with the Post, for since my Recovery from the Small Pox I have wrote regularly to you, & during that APRIL 21, 1777  time Colo. Lee frequently wrote to you. We are now threatened with a Visit from the Enemy, which has been the Case for some time; they have now nine Men of War in the Bay, & are making Preparations at N. York & Amboy, which most of our Generals think are intended against Philadelphia. I beleive they are too weak to succeed, but if they do, I am of Opinion they will ruin their Army, which is at this time very small, & is mouldering away by Sickness. We are too weak to take Advantage of their Situation. Ten thousand Men at this time would go near to finish the War. If the different Legislative & Executive Powers upon the Continent will inforce the late Resolutions of Congress, we may yet be free: we may collect a respectable Army, & upon that depends our Salvation as a People. Britain begins to totter, her Trade is cut off, & her Merchants become Bankrupt. Several considerable Houses have failed, which have drawn many others into the Ruin. We learn from St. Eustatia that two of the American Privateers have taken nine transports & two Guineamen, part of which have arrived safe at Martinique.(1) There are several Persons in Prison here for corresponding with & inviting the Enemy to come here. I beleive they are only the Tools of considerable Villains. whom I hope may yet be discovered. As soon as I have time I will wait upon Doctr. Rittenhouse & desire him to answer your Letters, but God knows when that will be, for we attend Congress from ten to four, & meet in Committee at six. I am glad to hear Mann is so well fixed, give my Love to him, to my Sister & the other little ones. I am dear Brother yours affectionately,  Mann Page Junr.  ""

  My dear Sir, Philadelphia 22d. April 1777  The inclosed resolve is now sent principally with a view of rectifying some Typographic errors that the copy formerly sent you contained. I am again, in the name of Congress, to desire your Excellency will detain the flower in Virginia until further directions, that Mr. Commissary Trumbul had sent Vessels from the eastward to remove.(1) The reason you assign, of danger from the enemies Cruisers, is conclusive with Congress for staying this provision a while.  Since I wrote you last, few occurrencies have happened worth noticing. Skirmishes often happen, in which we generally succeed. The enemy with 4000 men & 4 Gen. Officers surprised our post at Bound Brook and carried off a few prisoners with 2 pieces of Cannon. But they quickly retired and not without loss. To revenge this insult, Gen. Stephen attacked one of their picket guards and drove it in, killing 7 and making 16 prisoners. It seems to be the opinion of all men that 10, or 12000 men in the Jersies might quickly decide the fate of our enemies before reenforcements arrived to them. The Eastern Troops are all to undergo inoculation before they join the Army. Our Southern Troops that have arrived here ill all recovered & recovering from the Small pox having had the distemper very favourably, & as far as I have heard, without loss. We have accounts just now that 2 of our Privateers have taken and sent into Statia and Martinique nine sail of Transports on their way to N. York-and two Guinea Men bound to the West Indies. These transports were to call at the West Indies for rum for the Army & to avoid as much as possible the Eastern Privateers.  Deserters come out in numbers and say the enemies Army is very sickly and that the Men dye fast.  I am, with great esteem, dear Sir. !-our most affectionate & obedient. Richard Henry Lee  ""

  My dear Sir Philadelphia April 22d. 1777  I am much obliged to you for your several Letters, which remain a Debt unpaid, oweing to various Causes; first to Mrs. Page's Illness having detained me three Weeks on the Road, & really for Want of Time by the last Post. I thank you for them & will in Return give you all the News which we have here. The Enemy have for some time threatened this City & have made Preparations which induce our best Generals to think their principal Attack will be against this Place. On Sunday the 13th nine of their Men of War came into this Bay, which confirmed in great Measure the Information we had before received. Some Days before that Congress had ordered a Camp to be formed under Genl. Schuyler upon the West Side of Delaware for these Reasons. That the Soldiers, of whom there were a considerable Number in the City, might be drawn togather so as to be ready to oppose any sudden Attempt upon the City 'til the main Army could come up; that they would be more healthy in Camp than in Town; that they would support the Militia which might come in: that they would be able to reach the North River, if the Attack of the Enemy should be made there, before the rest of the Army could cross; & that they could speedily join the General to execute any Plan which he form in the Jersey. After all they were left to the General's Direction to order where he pleased. He in Part approves of the Measure, & has ordered the Camp to be formed at Bristol where all the troops that come from the Southward stop. The Design of Men of War at present seems to be to obstruct the trade of this Place. Preparations are making to receive them, so that if they succeed, I am of Opinion they will ruin their Army which is mouldering away by Sickness. Nothing has happened lately except a small Affair on Monday the 14th in which Genl. Steven surprized their Picquet, killed 7, & made 16 Prisoners. I am obliged to go to Congress, therefore must reserve the rest of my Letter for next Week. Give my Compts. to Mrs. Weedon, Mrs. Mercer & Mrs. Gordon. I am dear Sir, Your affectionate Friend, Mann Page Junr.  P.S.

Sir, Mr. (1) just told me, that a Privateer from Baltimore, has taken two valuable Prizes, with Sixteen Guns each. I can scarcely believe it. Have you heard of the Success of the Rattlesnake of Philadelphia, and the Sturdy Beggar of Maryland, Mr. Burn? These two Privateers have taken Eleven Prizes, and sent them into the West India Islands, Nine Transports and two Guinea Men. Confound the ill Luck, sir, I was going to sea myself on board the Rattlesnake and my Wife fell a yelping. These Wives are queer Things. I told her I wondered she had no more Ambition. Now, says I, when you walk the Street, and any Body asks who that is? The Answer is \""Burn the Barbers Wife.\"" Should you not be better pleased to hear it said \""That is Captain Burns Lady, the Captain of Marines on board the Rattlesnake\""?  Oh! says she, I had rather be called Burn the Barbers Wife, than Captain Burns Widow. I dont desire to live better, than you maintain me, my dear.  So it is, Sir, by this sweet, honey Language I am choused out of my Prizes, and must go on, with my Soap and Razors and Pinchers and Combs. I wish she had more Ambition.  If this Letter should be intercepted by the Tories, they will get a Booty. Let them enjoy it. If some of ther Wives had been as tender and discreet, as the Barbers, their Husbands Ambition would not have led them into so many Salt Ponds.. . . (2) What an Ignis fatuus this Ambition is!

  My dear Sir Philada. April 23d. 1777.(1) I take this earliest opportunity to acknowledge your Favor of the 26th of March.(2) Your letters are always very acceptable to me; I wish therefore that your Leisure would admit of your writing oftener.  I heartily concur with you in regreting the abominable Practice of prophane Swearing in our Army. It is indeed alarming. Congress has repeatedly injoyned the General officers to discountenance this Practice by their Authority and Influence. You know my Abhorrence of it, and may depend upon my exerting the utmost of my Endeavors if possible, to root it out of the Army.  We have been, and still are threatned with the Invasion of this City. I confess I have no great Apprehensions of it, for I very much question whether the Enemy are yet in a Condition to open the Campaign.(3) It is mortifying in the Extreme that a small Handfull of ragged, discontented, unpaid Mercenaries should be sufferd to remain so long in Jersey & Rhode Island. But this must be attributed to the unlucky Circumstances of our Troops having been inlisted for one year only. The Advantage which the Enemy have taken from this Mistake will I hope be prevented by a permanent Army for the future. Experience has shewn us past Errors, and we are endeavoring to correct them. The medical Department is now put upon a new footing, and Rules are establishing in the Quarter Masters for keeping our Soldiers clearly in their encampments whereby their Health as well as Lives will be preservd. The Expediency of inocculating our new raisd Troops, has retarded their March to the Places of their Destination; but we are daily getting through this Difficulty, and I am in good Hopes that we shall bring our Army into the Field, though later than was intended, in tollerable Season. A well appointed army will put it in the Power of our generals to take a more decisive Part. We must drive our Enemies into the Sea and be ready to attack them on that Element. I earnestly wish to see such an enterprizing Spirit as shall confound our Enemies, and give Assurances to the Friends of Liberty, that we still retain a just Sense of the Dignity of our Cause, and are resolved by Gods assistance to maintain it at all Hazzards. A Resolution passd in Congress Lately recommending to the New England States to raise their Militia & dislodge the Enemy at Rhode Island. I hope this will be done. Shall we not once more see that Spirit which animated our Countrymen at Lexington & Bunkers Hill.  You have Intelligence from Europe as early as we have it here. I rejoyce with you in the Arrival of the Amphitrite with Cannon & Stores from France. Our Friend A L in a Letter dated at Bordeaux the 20th of Feby says that \""ten thousand German & three thousand British Troops are to sail from England for Boston early in the Spring.\"" (4) I have always been of opinion that New England would again be the Seat of the APRIL 23, 1777  War, and I have in my Letters to my Friends thro' the Winter past been endeavouring to impress this opinion upon their Minds. I am utterly at a Loss to what Cause to impute the Failure of the Eastern States to send forward a Reinforcement of Militia to Ticonderoga when it was so pressingly urged upon them by Congress early in the Winter. I am ready to attribute it to any thing rather than a Want of Zeal & Vigor, but It is humiliating to have it suspected to be the Fact, and it troubles me beyond Measure to find honest men disposd to give Credit to what unprincipled Tories are industriously propagating here that publick Virtue and the military Spirit is totally lost in New England and that People have given themselves up to Luxury and Avarice. I hope it is not the Voice of every Citizen Quzrendo Pecunia primum est. If it be not the general Doctrine, I pray you my dear Sir to give me your Assurances to the Contrary.  Congress a few Days ago determind to establish a Marine board in the Eastern Department to consist of three Members who are to reside in or near Boston with the Power of adjourning to any other place. They are to be subject to the Directions of the Marine Committee of Congress. I hope this Board will facilitate our Naval Affairs and put them upon a more respectable Footing.(5) This Day General Warren, Mr Vernon Late of Newport & Mr Deshon of New London were elected to this Board with a Salary of 1500 Dollars per Annum each. A Number of Gentlemen of the Massachusetts had been nominated by the Members of that State; Mr C______ (6)was nominated by Mr Duane of New York & As the gentlemen of Connecticutt and Rhode Island were urgent, it would not have been prudent for us to have been strenuous for the Choice of all out of our own State, though I am inclind to think there might have been a better Choice. Mr Warrens Character has long been revered in Congress. Mr. C had been personally known to many of the Members, Mr Deshon to no one. The two last had an equal Number of Votes but neither of them a competent Number. On a second Tryal Mr Deshon obtaind the Election.  I heartily concur with you in regretting. (7)  ""

  Honored Sir Philadelphia April 23d. 1777 We received Your Honrs. Letter of the 16th Instant by Mr Brown. Your Letter to Congress was also received & read yesterday, & referred to the Committee for Foreign affairs.(1) Nothing very remarkable has occurred here Since my last-Nor any later advices received from France. The recruiting Service makes but slow progress in this State the Battalions not half full, in Virginia about two thirds of their Number are inlisted. In the Carolinas I hear their Numbers are near compleated, but many are prevented by the Small pox from Joyning the army. Congress was not disposed to censure the Eastern States for giving Additional Bounties, Supposing them to be the best Judges of the expediency of the Measure. The Committees of the Middle States did nothing as to regulating prices, they being equally divided in opinion respecting the matter. The prices of almost all kinds of Articles are very high here. The Commissary General arrived here Yesterday and a Committee is appointed to confer with him & consider what further regulations ought to be made in his department. The Journals of Congress are not yet published further than to the first of last May. A new Printer is Employed to bring them up to this time from the tenth of May 1775. I furnished Your Honr. with the journals from September to the last of December 1775, last Fall. I now Send the proceedings from the first of January to the last of April 1776;(2) the printer will compleat the rest as fast as possible. I have Sent Several of the late papers which contain Some resolutions of Congress, and particularly the regulation of the Hospital. Making Cannon is an object that deserves attention, as Several of the Frigates are detained only for want of Guns. Those made at Salisbury are allowed to be of the best kind, and tho' they are higher by the Ton than those made here, yet I have heard it observed they are not dearer on the whole, being much lighter. I hope the two Delegates Your Honr. Mentions will attend Congress by the first of May, as I want to return home. I am Sorry there is occasion to call the Militia to Joyn the army. I think it would be unnecessary if the Men inlisted were collected together. What is recommended respecting Rhode-Island, it was hoped, would not detain the Militia for a very long time after their assembling. I am glad to hear of the Success of the Brigg Defence. I will take the first opportunity to transmit to your Honr Copies of all Petitions of the Several States heretofore made to the King, that I can obtain. Congress has resolved to appoint three Commissioners to reside in or near Bos- APRIL 23, 1777  ton with power to adjourn to any other part of New England to Superintend the Building, fitting out and manning the Ships of War ordered to be Built there, & to provide Naval magazines & generally to direct the Naval affairs in New England Subject to the Orders of the Marine Committee.(3)A recommendation passed Yesterday to the Several States to furnish Congress with their Laws, and to Send them to each of the other States that they may be acquainted with each others Laws-also to communicate any new discoveries they may make in the art of War or other useful Arts. (4) By a letter from General Heath to the Board of War it appears that the most of the Powder made in the Massachusetts Bay is bad and not to be depended on, & that they have a large Quantity of it. I hope the Inspectors of Powder in Connecticut will take Sufficient care that what is manufactured there is good, as the Safety of the State depends on its being Good. The price of Board is increased here about one third, & horsekeeping double. There must be a large quantity of paper money in circulation while the war lasts. I wish a spirited Effort might Soon be made to Subdue the Enemy's force now in the Country. General Wolcott is in a good State of Health. He Saw Your Honrs. Letter and desired me to Write to your Honr. what was needful, but as we had nothing very important to write thought it unnecessary for both to Subscribe the Letter.  I am with Great Esteem & Regards, Your Honor's Obedient humble Servant, Roger Sherman  ""

  My Dear Sir Philadelphia 23d Apl 1777 Your two favors one of 26th March & the other 5th March which I suppose shod be April came to hand Yesterday.(1) I find You have hard work to Perswade gentn to serve their Country, what can be the meaning of this? Do Gentn still think it Hazardous to appear in a Charecter that will render them obnoxious to the British Tyrant & his infernal Tools? or are they afraid their Private interest will suffer? The day Perhaps is not far Off when some of those Gentn. who now are so loath to step forth, will be rnaking interest for a seat in Congress, they may be gratified for APRIL 23 , 1777  what I care, and let those who are now Laboring in the vineyard, enjoy the Blessings of Domestic Happiness, with the Pleasing Reflections that will result from a Consciousness of having lent their aid when their Country most wanted it. However, it seems you have at least found two Gentn who will come, & I wish they may set out as soon as possible.(2) Col. Thornton intends to leave this place in about ten days & I wish to follow him before the weather is too warm.  The last accot. from Our Commissioners was under the 6th Feby. They then had not heard of our successes in Jersey but I imagine our dispatches must have reachd them soon after. The accots then circulating all over Europe were such as were most agreeable to the British Court and really stagered some of Our Friends but notwithstanding this our Commisrs. had established a Bank in France, & one of them had set out for Spain. Another was to go in a short time for Holland. There did not appear to be the least probability of Britains geting any assistance from Russia. The most they expected to reinforce their Army in America with is 10.000 but the Court of France say they can not send near that number. There is every appearance of a General war in Europe & it is my opinion that Hostilities are commenc'd by this time. The Opposition to the Measures of administration in England increases, which will help to Confound their Councils. We daily Expect to have more particular accots. Our Commissrs. say they did not chuse to write so perticularly by Merchant ships as there had been some instances of carelessness in masters that had been taken who sufferd the letters to fall into the Enemies hands.  Our army is daily increasing and by the accot received by Spies & deserters that of the Enemy is daily weakening so that I think our prospects are tolerably good. I shall write you more fully in a few days. In the meantime beg leave to assure you that I am very Sincerely Yours,  Wm. Whipple ""

  Sir, Philadelphia 23d April 1777 Your Favour of the 3d and 9t inst is recd. in the Latter of which came inclosed a Letter from Rhina. I perceive the little Child has had the Small Pox bad. But blessed be God that she has recovered from it. I perceive that Mrs. Wolcotts Health has been for a long time low, I fear more so than I am informed of. I wish to know how she is more explicitly than I  APRIL 23, 1777  have hitherto done, for tho' I mean to Return Home as soon as I can yet that may not probably be till I may have the Return of another Letter from you in Case you can put it into the Post Office, the most sure as well as expeditious mode of Conveyance.  Govr Trumbull has mentioned in sundry of his Letters that Two Gentlemen would soon attend Congress. In his last he says they may be expected in May. Perhaps some Variation is expected in Regard to the circumstances of this City, tho' I do not myself think that the Enemy will Endeavour to come here. Nothing Material which bears any respect to this Circumstance has occurred since my last to you of the 1st inst. My long Absence from my Family and my hearing that Mrs. Wolcott does not injoy Health inclines me to Return as soon as I can suppose the publick Service and Expectation will Admit. I see the justice of your Remarks on some of our People. It is certainly the most proper time for the Devil to be the Most Busy when he can do the Most Mischeif. As Contingencys may happen so that I may be able to Return sooner than I now expect, I would advise you and my Freinds not to Write to Me any Thing which may be attended with any ill Effects if their Letters should fall into the Hands of any one.  Our Accounts from abroad are in general that it is not probable that G. Britain will be able to send over any large Number of Troops for this Campaign. The Appearance of a Rupture in Europe encreases. The Opposition in G. Britain is loud, the Administration inflexible-my own Apprehension is that the British Warfare in future will be carryed on rather in the Way of destressing us, than by Conquest. New Methods to delude in hopes to divide will probably be invented. And they will rather hope to succeed in their Veiws, by harrassing and specious Pretences than by an Expectation that their Armys will be irresistable. But I hope God will preserve us as well from their Machinations as the Power of their Arms. I Wish you would Write to me as soon as you can in Regard to the Wellfare of my Family.

  My Dear, Philadelphia 23d April 1777  I have recd a Letter from Rhina inclosed in one from Mr. Lyman, by which I perceive that your Health is still low. I hope you attend to the Recovery of it as much as you can, the Distress which you underwent during the Sickness of the Family must have been great and it becomes us to be thankful that God. has carryed you and the Family thro the Disorder. Rhina Says you are using Cordials for your Cough, by which APRIL 23, 1777  I suppose it is tho't that it is Occasioned by a Translation of the Rhumatic Disorder to the Breast or Lungs. I wish that you might have the Opinion of some able Physician upon your Case. Riding might be of Service to you. But whatever you find conducive to your Health I hope you attend to-And may God grant you his Protection and Blessing. It has been for a long time Said that Two Gentlemen would soon Attend as Deligates, but none yet come, tho We are Still told the same Thing. As soon as any one Arrives I shall return Home.(1) I shall unless something uncommon prevents undoubtedly Return next Month, but not perhaps till the later part of it. But you will hear from me again Shortly. I Wrote Rhina a Letter the 15t (2) so that I shall not Write to her till the next Oppertunity. As to the Articles which she mentions I shall attend to them. Every Thing here bears a Price which is extremely high. Linnens of the Coarsest kind which used to be sold for 2/6 or 3/ cannot now be had under 15/ or 20/ per yard and every other Article Much in the Same Proportion. You will let me know whether you would have me Buy any Linnens on a Family Acco. I am well enough supplyed on my own particular Acco. without having had any Occasion to purchase. The Other Articles I shall purchase, and this if you advise to it. Nothing Material has occurred here since my last. Many imagine that Genl. Howe will again Attempt to come to this City. But it is not my Expectation. I think in his present Circumstances he will not Risque an Expedition of this Nature. The Letter from Rhina is Very Acceptable. My Love to my Children and Friends.

  Sir, Philadelphia April 24th 1777.  Since my last Congress received a Letter from Gl. Washington, which contained some Things that respect our State.(1) I therefore made some Minutes and Extracts therefrom, and now inclose them to you; and two or three of the latest News Papers.  APRIL 24, 1777  The Extract about an Attack on Rhode-Island is a Sort of an Answer to the Resolves of Congress relative to that necessary Business. The Advertisement I consider as a Puff.(2) If the Enemy had counterfeited Congress Notes, and meant to circulate them they would hardly have advertised it. Genl. Washington views it as an unparelled Peice of Artifice. I submit to his better Judgment. However as he had been informed that a Person had gone from York to Rhode-Island with a Quantity of counterfeit Money, it can't be amiss to look out.  I wish that the Recommendation of Congress may be attended to and animate our and its neighbouring States; so that such a Body of Men may be collected for an Attack on Rhode-Island as may excuse Us from the Imputation of Listlesness or Cowardice.  It is thought that the Enemy intend to attack this City, if they should they may be defeated. Besides the Disadvantage to Commerce which attends their getting and holding Possession of our Sea-Ports, our Ships of War by being blocked up in our Rivers are rendred useless, and We loose Reputation in foreign States. I hope that the State of Rhode Island will exert itself on this Occasion and gather Laurels. We have nothing new. Mr. Marchant is not arrived. I shall expect to be informed as early as possible after the Choice of a Delegate. I have been long from my Family, & know not how they are situated. If I should be rechosen the Assembly will I doubt not grant me Liberty to return for a Time. Govr. Hopkins will I hope come forward and supply my Place; for it is still my Opinion that our State should always have at least Two Delegates in Congress. The Advantages resulting herefrom would more than compensate the Expence. Heartily wishing for the Recovery of Rhode-Island, the Happiness and Prosperity of the State I have the Honor to represent in Congress, and for the Health & Felicity of its Governor I continue to be with great Respect, Your Honor's most obedient, humble Servant, Wm Ellery  ""

Nothing from England, nothing from France, Spain, or any other Part of Europe, nothing from the West Indies. Nothing from Howe, and his Banditti, nothing from General Washington. APRIL 26, 1777  There are various Conjectures that Lord How is dead, sick, or gone to England, as the Proclamations run in the Name of Will. Howe only, and nobody from New York can tell any Thing of his Lordship.  I am wearied out, with Expectations that the Massachusetts Troops would have arrived, e'er now, at Head Quarters. Do our People intend to leave the Continent in the Lurch? Do they mean to submit? or what Fatality attends them? With the noblest Prize in View, that ever Mortals contended for, and with the fairest Prospect of obtaining it upon easy Terms, The People of the Massachusetts Bay, are dead.  Does our State intend to send only half, or a third of their Quota? Do they wish to see another, crippled, disastrous and disgracefull Campaign for Want of an Army? I am more sick and more ashamed of my own Countrymen, than ever I was before. The Spleen, the Vapours, the Dismals, the Horrors, seem to have seized our whole State.  More Wrath than Terror, has seized me. I am very mad. The gloomy Cowardice of the Times, is intollerable in N. England.  Indeed I feel not a little out of Humour, from Indisposition of Body.

I am a Fool if ever there was one to be such a Slave. I wont be much longer. I will be more free in some World or other.  Is it not intollerable, that the opening Spring, which I should enjoy with my Wife and Children upon my little Farm, should pass away, and laugh at me, for labouring, Day after Day, and Month after Month, in a Conclave, Where neither Taste, nor Fancy, nor Reason, nor Passion, nor Appetite can be gratified?

  Sir April 26th 1777 Your letter of the 14th instant is the only one we have received since the misfortune of carrying away your masts or indeed since you left the Capes of Delaware so that we are strangers to the cause and manner of that unfortunate accident, if you wrote us any previous Letter it never reached our hands. We observe with infinite concern that your people have been and remain Sickly-this has happened in so many of our Ships that we cannot help attributing it to some cause that may with proper care & attention be removed. You should therefore insist that your officers do frequenly see the Ship thoroughly and perfectly cleansed, aloft and below from Stem to Stern, burn Powder and wash with vinigar betwixt Decks order Hammocks, all bedding, bed Cloths and Body Cloaths daily into the quarters or to be aired on Deck, make the people keep their persons cleanly and use exercise-give them as frequent changes of wholesome food as you can, Fish when you can get it and fresh food in Port. Ventilate the Hold and between Decks constantly. In short cleanliness, exercise, fresh air and wholesome food will restore or preserve health more than medicine and it is deserving the utmost attention of any or every officer to preserve the Health & Spirits of the men. If he does not do it he never can make a figure but performing this there is nothing he may not accomplish be his ambition ever so great. We expect the Randolph will be fitted and ready for Sea by the time that this reaches you, and it is sent by Express that it may not arrive too late, you are then to follow these Instructions, as we hereby revoke those given you by Mr. Morris on our behalf.(1) You are to receive from the Continental Agents at Charles Town, any quantity of Casks or Packages of Merchandize that they may have to ship on the public account and take them on board the Randolph. It is not meant by this that they will ship APRIL 26, 1777  more than you can conveniently take in, or so much as to make the ship deep, or in any degree interfere with the duty or business of a Ship of war. Perhaps 50, 60 or 70 Casks of Indico may be the extent, and at the same time that we avoid as much as possible incommoding the ship, we recommend accommodating the Public service all in your power. It is absolutely necessary that we make immediate Remittances to our Agent at Cape Francois in the Island of Hispaniola as his Credit is nearly ruined there for want of them, and ours has greatly suffered by having three Vessels laded here intended for his relief blocked up by the enemy a long time & no likelyhood of their getting away. You will therefore consult with the Agents and receive from them as much of the goods as they have to Ship as you possibly can without injuring the fighting or Sailing of the Ship. It is not only necessary to make these Remittances but to make them speedily, and therefore we expect your utmost endeavours will be used to get away with the goods immediately.  The Agents will be ordered to Load one or more Vessels if possible and send along with you to the Cape; you are to receive them under your Convoy and give them proper Signals and Sailing orders and then proceed with them direct for the said Port of Cape Francois useing your utmost endeavours to keep Company and carry them safe into that Port where you will apply to Mr Stephen Ceronio our Agent, whom you will probably find in a good deal of distress which your safe arrival will relieve him from. To this Gentleman you are to deliver the goods shipped by the Agents at Carolina and to him the other Ships will be consigned. He will procure for you any necessarys wanted there and will attend you in a Vissit to the Governor, Intendent and proper officers of whom you will ask the liberty and protection of the Port and pay the proper Compliments on behalf of the States you serve. We have advice that the American Trade to and from Hispaniola is nearly destroyed by the Cruizers from Jamaica consisting of two Frigates, Two Brigantines, Two 14 Gun Sloops and 4 or 5 small schooners and it will be a work of great merit to take and destroy such of these plunderers as your force will enable you to Cope with; and that we judge may be either of the Frigates separately, or all the others in any Shape. Going with your Convoy and goods on board it will be prudent to avoid large Vessels, but when you have delivered the goods at the Cape, we desire you may not loose an Hours Time in that Port, take in any fresh provisions or stores you want and immediately go out on a Cruize against these enemies of our Peace, Happiness and Prosperity. The Randolph by all accounts comes to our ears has the Heels of most ships that swim-therefore if the Frigates Cruize together you can avoid them, if you meet either single we hope you can & will take them but particularly exert your utmost diligence and endeavours, to take, sink or destroy all the small Cruizers of our enemies that infest that Coast, and after driveing them from the Cape go down to the Mole St. Nicholas and clear that Coast of them as America has   much valuable Commerce there. Any American Traders that may be ready to sail when you leave these Ports convoy them safe off, and meeting any bound in you will contribute what you can to their safety. Mr. John Dupuy at the Mole will supply you with what may be wanting there. The Ship or two Ships that go under your Convoy from Carolina, as also a Brigantine Anne, Captain Garrigues, and Sloop Phoebe, Captain Gilbert, will have to sail from thence to America soon after your arrival there wherefore you will fix with Mr. Ceronio the time when they will [be] ready to depart and return from your first Cruize at that time on purpose to Convoy them out and off that Coast as they will have stores on board for the Continental service. You will procure at every Port you go into and from every Prize you make as many Seamen as possible to enter our service. We hope you will have the good fortune to take many Prizes & amongst them a Number of those Cruizers that have been fitted out against us. You may send your Prizes into the Cape or Mole consigned to Mr Ceronio, or Mr Dupuy, who will make sale of them to the best advantage if permitted by the Government there as is done in other French Ports both in Europe and the West Indies; or you may send them to the Continent to the first safe Port they can make. But should you take any fast sailing Vessel with Guns and Stores suitable and can spare officers and men for her you may employ one or more such as Tenders to Cruize in Concert with you, giving the Commanding officer a Copy of your Commission and suitable Instructions; and we hope by this means you will be able not only to Clear Hispaniola of Cruizers but also to retaliate the injuries they have done us, on the Trade of Jamaica; and for this purpose you should get Mr. Dupuy or some other Person to employ a proper person in Jamaica or to send one on purpose to send up accounts regularly to the Mole of the Times when single ships or fleets are ready to sail and the Convoys intended to gaurd them. Such intelligence will be very useful to you on many accounts and on every occasion. You may employ the Randolph in the manner already pointed out to the 10th of July next, when you are [to] open the Sealed Instructions inclosed herein (2) and as those Instructions require from you an other Service you must keep your ship in as good Order and as well manned as possible and in every respect fit for Action at that period or as much so as the Circumstances of your Cruize will permit. Should it be necessary we immagine you might heave down or give the ship a Parliament Heel at the Cape or Mole. Any Prisoners that you take who will not enter into our Service you may Exchange at Jamaica for Americans taken in Armd Vessels and held as Prisoners there, sending down a flag from the Mole for that purpose if you think it necessary or if convenient you may send or bring them to the Continent always treating them with humanity. We wish to hear of strict discipline being introduced in our Navy, at the same time we recommend kind usage and great care of the Crews. You  must attend to the Printed Instructions of the Navy Board and with the best wishes for your success, We remain Sir, Your very hble servants  ""

From what you write she will be fitted and ready for the sea by the Time this reaches [you], and it is sent by Express that the orders may arrive in Time.  We very chearfully express our approbation of your Conduct in employing the Schooner Lewis, Captain Stevens, to assist in taking up the anchor and cable you mention, as well as in making a purchase of the Schooner Betsey to continue that service and shall acquiese in such reasonable reward as you may think a proper recompence for the services of Mr. Richard [Hurn?] in this business, never doubting but you will have due regard to the Interest of our Infant Country, which will have to struggle with a heavy debt after the present contest is ended. It is the duty of every individual to take what care they can for the States but more particularly it is the duty of all Public officers, and we are persuaded your Conduct will bear the proper Marks of Oeconomy. Under this perswasion we desire the continuance of your endeavours to save what can be saved of the Anchors, Cables, Guns or Stores of that Fleet which suffered such distress in their Attack on fort Moultree as forced them to leave these things behind them. As the increasing of our Navy will be a constant object it will be necessary to purchase suitable Materials and Stores whenever they can be met with in these States. The Actions (2) Anchor will no doubt come into use before long and you will please to purchase it on the lowest terms in your power; the price of the best Anchors made here before the price of Labour was raised by our inlistments was 6 1/2d this Currency per lb. but an Anchor suitable for the Public service and obtained as a prise should not be held in proportion to the general state of enormous Prices that too much prevail through the Continent at this time. You must purchase this and such other Materials and stores suitable for the Navy as you meet with  APRIL 26, 1777  them, as cheap as possible. The Experiments (3) Cable had best be unlaid and as you propose made up into small Rigging, we mean that of 40 fathom. The whole Cable may remain as well as the Anchors until we order them for the use of some of the ships now building. The Other Anchors and Cables not delivered to Captain Biddle may remain for the same purpose & when you have finished the business of taking them up, you'l send us a return of all that remains after the Randolph is gone.  We shall order you to be Credited for the amount of the supplies to the Schooner Lewis, Sloop Hornet and Ship Randolph in due time and you will furnish the Accounts and vouchers for those supplies. We understand there are some of the Actions Guns that have been saved by the State of South Carolina, we wish to purchase them as we find some dificulty in getting Guns cast fast enough. These Guns are not so suitable for the Land as for the sea service and we hope the State will part with them. If they agree give us immediate notice that we send for them, but should they refuse to sell they will probably exchange. We are told the Guns are 9 Pounders and it may be in our power to procure 9 Pounders of the long sort which are fitter for fortification. If any of those ships Guns still remain in the water you will no doubt use your utmost endeavours to have them taken up & we flatter ourselves that success will attend you. The Service Captain Biddle is now Ordered upon being urgent and the objects in veiw important, we request your utmost exertions to get him out to sea as soon after the receipt of this Letter as it possibly can be done. With much esteem we remain Gentn, Your hble servants  P.S. As Mr. Clarkson wishes to leave Carolina for a few Months, we can have no objection as you will take care that the public bussiness does not suffer thereby.

(1) Yesterday the Committee to enquire into my conduct began that Business.(2) I believe they will finish in the course of the week and that their report will be agreeable to my wishes; and such a change has taken place in the sentiments of the members who were unacquainted with me, that it is thought they will expunge the resolutions of the 15th of March,(3) copy whereof you have enclosed, but they have a much more difficult point to get over. They wish me to remain in the command, but having already appointed, (or at least implicativly so) Gen. Gates to the command of the Northern department,(4) they do not know how to manage the matter. They wish to make Ticonderoga a separate command; that they have a right to do, but they know that I will not serve at Albany on those conditions. Indeed, not on any unless an absolute command is giving [given] me over every part of the army in the Northern department. This they will not do, and therefore I shall return Mr. Schuyler only to Albany.  Adieu and believe me most sincerely Dr. Sir yours etc.  Ph.

  Ap. 27. 1777 Your Favours of Ap. 2 and Ap. 7. I have received.  The inclosed Evening Post, will give you, some Idea, of the Humanity of the present Race of Brittons.(1) My Barber, whom I quote as often as ever I did any Authority, says \""he has read Histories of Cruelty; and he has read Romances of Cruelty: But the Cruelty of the British exceeds all that he ever read.\""  For my own Part, I think We cannot dwell too much, on this Part of their Character, and Conduct. It is full of important Lessons. If the Facts only were known, in the Utmost Simplicity of Narration, they would strike every pious, and humane Bosom, in Great Britain with Horror....(2) Every Conscience in that Country is not callous nor every Heart hardened.  The plainest Relation of Facts, would interest the Sympathy, and Compassion of all Europe in our Favour. And it would convince every American that a Nation, so great a Part of which is thus deeply depraved, can never be again trusted with Power over Us.  I think that not only History should perform her Office, but Painting, Sculpture, Statuary, ( Medalling?) and Poetry ought to assist in publishing to the World, and perpetuating to Posterity, the horrid deeds of our Enemies. It will shew the Persecution, We suffer, in defence of our Rights-it will shew the Fortitude, Patience, Perseverance and Magnanimity of Americans, in as strong a Light, as the Barbarity and Impiety of Britons, in this persecuting War. Surely, Impiety consists, in destroying with such hellish Barbarity, the rational Works of the Deity, as much as in blaspheming and defying his Majesty.  If there is a moral Law: if there is a divine Law-and that there is every intelligent Creature is conscious-to trample on these Laws, to hold them in Contempt and Defyance; is the highest Exertion of Wickedness, and Impiety, that Mortals can be guilty of. The Author of human Nature, who gave it its Rights, will not see it ruined, and suffer its destroyers to escape with Impunity. Divine Vengeance will sometime or other, overtake the Alberts, the Phillips, and Georges-the Alvas, the Grislers and Howes, and vindicate the Wrongs of oppressed human Nature.  I think that Medals in Gold, Silver and Copper ought to be struck in Commemoration of the shocking Cruelties, the brutal Barbarities and the diabolical Impieties of this War, and these should be contrasted with the Kindness, Tenderness, Humanity and Philanthropy, which have marked the Conduct of Americans towards their Prisoners.  It is remarkable, that the Officers and Soldiers of our Enemies, are so totally depraved, so compleatly destitute of the Sentiments of Philanthropy in their own Hearts, that they cannot believe that such delicate Feelings APRIL 27, 1777  can exist in any other, and therefore have constantly ascribed that Milk and Honey with which We have treated them to Fear, Cowardice, and conscious Weakness. But in this they are mistaken, and will discover their Mistake too late to answer any good Purpose for them.  ""

  Sir Philadelphia Ap. 27. 1777 Your Favour of 25 March I duely recd.(1) The Plan of riding you mention, between Boston and Falmouth, appears to me, reasonable enough, but the Committee will not incline to take upon themselves, Regulations of that kind of which they cannot be so good Judges, at this Distance as the Post Masters who are nearer. My Advice would be for Mr Hastings, Mr Libby and yourself, to confer upon this Subject with each other, in Person or by Letter and, any Representation of this Matter to the Post Master General, Mr Bache, in which you three can agree will no doubt be readily adopted.  Mr Hastings's Memorial has been considered, and the Post Master General has been impowered to make an addition to his allowance, not exceeding two hundred Dollars a year which I hope will do him Justice.  I wish it was in my Power to send you the Constitutions of the several States, but it is not. They are not to be had here. I wish you Success, equal to your Desires, in establishing an happy Form of Government. But the Rage of Speculation and the Flames of Passion have spread so far, in our State, that I am not without my Fears that you will be too much divided in Sentiment to erect a very vigorous Government. Our State abounds with ambitious Men, in such Numbers, and with avaritious ones, who are still worse, and with others in whom both Passions unite, in a great degree, who are the most dangerous of all, that I fear our Government, will be turbulent, our Laws unstable, and consequently our Exertions too languid.(2)  Time however, may correct Extravagances, and make our Posterity happy, but I much fear that our Happiness of the present Age must consist chiefly in the Contemplation of theirs.  You and I however, I hope shall have the Consolation of reflecting that We have done our Utmost, upon the purest Principles of Philanthropy, to promote the Happiness of the present as well as future ages.  APRIL 27, 1777  I find it difficult to get an oppertunity of sending the Journals of Congress, such of them as are printed. But will embrace the first I can find.  I hope that our State will compleat its Complement of Men, to a single soldier. This Campaign will be the most interesting, and I have Strong Hopes, will be the last that will be attended with much Hazard or Difficulty. At least the Stronger We are this year, the more likely it will be to put a Period to the War. I am, sir, with much Respect, your most obedient sert, John Adams  ""

  Philadelphia April 27th. 1777 Sunday.(1) I think it is Montesquieu, who Somewhere observes, that the English of Charles's days were perpetually bewildered in their Pursuit of a Republic, for being themselves extremely corrupt, they Sought in vain for that pure and disinterested Principle upon which, alone, a Commonwealth can Stand.  The Principle of Republican Government, is as little understood in America as its Spirit is felt. Ambition in a Republic, is a great Virtue, for it is nothing more than a Desire to Serve the Public, to promote the Happiness of the People, to increase the Wealth, the Grandeur, and Prosperity of the Community. Thus, Ambition is but another Name for public Virtue, and public Spirit. But the Ambition which has Power for its object, which desires to increase the Wealth, the Grandeur, and the Glory of an Individual, at the Expense of the Community, is a very heinous Vice.  What Shall We Say of Oliver Cromwell? What Shall We Say of others, his Coadjutors? Can we Say, that they were actuated by a Love of the Public? Were they not governed by Selfish Motives? I make no Scruple to confess that I think Oliver totally destitute of the Republican Principle of public Virtue. He thought himself honest and sincere. So did Balaam, when he asked Leave to curse Israel. There never was a greater self deceiver than Oliver Cromwell. The Man after Gods own Heart, to whom Nathan Said Thou art the Man, deceived himself in the Same manner. How sincere was he, when he felt such honest Indignation against the Man who had taken his poor Neighbours Lamb.  We, in America, are so contaminated with the Selfish Principles of Monarchy, and with that bastard, corrupted Honour, that Monarchy inspires that we have no Idea, no Conception, no Imagination, no Dream, of the Passions and Principles which Support Republics. What will become of Us? God knows.  The Commissary General, this Evening related me an Anecdote which gave me great Spirit as it seems an Evidence that Integrity was not lost out of the world.  He Said that in comparing his accounts he missed Seventy Pounds, and puzzled himself a long Time, to no Purpose to discover where it could be gone. For several Months he had given it up as lost and unaccountable. At last Coll Cary of Bridgewater (of whose military Abilities, I had no opinion ) came to him and told him that after he went home from Cambridge where he had commanded a Regiment of Militia, he paid off every Bill and had Seventy Pounds left. He recollected that he had recd no Money but from the Commissary General, and therefore that he must have recd too much. This accounted for the Commissarys Loss. Here was Integrity. If all Americans were Carys, we should be fit  APRIL 27, 1777  for a Republic. But, how many Carys have We? I am afraid to say how few I think we have.  ""

They have an Army in Canada, another in Rhode Island, another in New York and the Jersies, which will enable them to take the Field, much earlier than they did last year.  Where is our Army to oppose them? General Washington has but a small one with him. At Ticonderoga, by Letters received this day from General Waine who commands there, We have not a Thousand Men.  We have been continually flattered, with assurances that many Men were inlisted and marched and marching to Ti and to Morristown. But none of them or next to none arrive. What Purpose can it answer to deceive Us? If the Massachusetts is exhausted, if it is discouraged, if it neither can nor will afford its Quota of Troops, in the Name of Truth and Candor let Us know it.  The Lassitude of that State has a most pernicious Effect upon all others. Our Weakness in every Quarter, encourages the Tories every where, induces Numbers to fly to How and inlist with him. It has a dismal gloomy APRIL 28, 1777  Effect upon the Whiggs. It is transmitted to England, and encourages the Ministerial People and disheartens opposition. It is transmitted all over Europe by our Enemies and cannot be contradicted by our Friends and has a pernicious Influence upon our affairs abroad.

Depend upon it they will never aid us, while they think we are despairing of our own affairs.  Not a Single Company from our State at Head Quarters. What are We to think?  ""

Nay our Army under Washington is so dispirited by confirmed Weakness, that the Spirit of Desertion prevails among them, and there are more go over to How, from our Army than come from his to ours, two to one.  Every Man of the Massachusetts Quota ought to have been ready last December. And not one Man has yet arrived in the Field-and not three hundred Men at Ticonderoga. It is our Weakness, and Want of Power to protect the People that makes Tories and Deserters. I have been abominably deceived about the Troops. If Ticonderoga is not lost it will be because it is not attacked-and if It should be New England will bear all the shame and all the Blame of it. In plain English I beg to be supported or recalled.  The Torment of hearing eternally Reflections upon my Constituents, that they are all dead, all turned Tories, that they are small Beer, which froths and foams for a few Moments while it is new, and then flattens down, to worse than Water, without being able to contradict or answer them is what I will not endure.  By a Letter from A. Lee 20 Feb. Burgoigne is coming with Ten Thousand Germans and three thousand British to Boston.(1) They will go first to Rhode Island I suppose, From thence they will join How or go to Boston according to Circumstances. If you make up a decent Force under Washington in the Jersies, How must order them all to him, or he will be demolished, for he has but a small Force at present. If you leave Washington weak, They will march to Boston. I am &c  ""

  Sir Philadelphia April 29th 1777  An express going hence to Charlestown gives me an opportunity of writing you a few lines, but without being able to communicate any thing interesting.  We have at present in Congress a representation of all the Colonies, altho' the number of Delegates is not very considerable. New York entertains the most virulent jealousy against her Eastern Neighbours, and it is now heightened by an affair which is something embarrassing. The inhabitants of what is usually called the New Hampshire Grants, have attempted to set up a distinct State, and sent Delegates to Congress to claim a seat. New York remonstrated; the new State (called New Connecticut) seemed to be patronised by the Eastern Delegates; but the Congress laid the papers on the table, and I hope will be wise enough APRIL 29, 1777  to decline any interposition. I am for my own part clearly against assuming a Judiciary power. Such certainly never was the purpose of our Delegation. As I consider all jealousies as injurious to our common cause and as laying the foundation of future evils, I use my best endeavours to discourage them; and I endeavour as much as possible to keep our attention to the main business, that of subduing our common enemy.  The Confederation comes under consideration two days in every week. On this arduous subject you will easily imagine I want the assistance of my colleagues, and indeed wish it reserved for men more able and experienced than I am. I shall give it however the most attentive consideration, and certainly shall agree to nothing, but on the clearest conviction and most uncontroverted principles. I shall very carefully abstract all the debates of any moment upon it, and every other subject, but particularly upon that, and when I transmit it to you, I will transmit the debates also.(1) At present, nothing but executive business is done, except the Confederation, and on mere executive business there are seldom any debates (and still more seldom any worth remembering). We have agreed to three articles; one containing the name; the second a declaration of the Sovereignty of the States, and an express provision that they be considered as retaining every power not expressly delegated; and the third an agreement mutually to assist each other against every enemy. The first and latter passed without opposition or dissent, the second occasioned two days debate. It stood originally the third article; and expressed only a reservation of the power of regulating internal police, and consequently resigned every other power. It appeared to me that this was not what the States expected, and, I thought, it left it in the power of the future Congress or General Council to explain away every right belonging to the States, and to make their own power as unlimited as they please. I proposed, therefore, an amendment, which held up the principle, that all sovereign Power was in the States separately, and that particular acts of it, which should be expressly enumerated, would be exercised in conjunction, and not otherwise; but that in all things else each State would Exercise all the rights and powers of sovereignty, uncontrolled. This was at first so little understood that it was some time before it was seconded, and South Carolina first took it up. The opposition was made by Mr Wilson of Pennsylvania, and Mr R. H. Lee of Virginia: in the End however the question was carried for my proposition, Eleven ayes, one no, and one divided. The no was Virginia; the divided, New Hampshire.(2) I was much pleased to find the opinion of accumulating powers to Congress so little supported, and I promise myself, in the whole business I shall find my ideas relative thereto nearly similar to those of most of the States. In a word, Sir, I am of opinion the Congress should have power enough to call out and apply the common strength for the common defence: but not for the partial purposes of ambition. We shall next proceed to the structure of the Common Councils; (3) and here,   I think, we shall meet with difficulties of the most arduous nature. The inequality of the States, and yet the necessity for maintaining their separate independence, will occasion dilemmas almost inextricable. You shall, Sir, know the whole progress of the matter, if I can conceive and convey it with sufficient clearness.  Maryland has set an exceeding good example to the other States in laying a tax. I hope it will be followed in ours. I mean not in the mode, but the thing. It is the only adequate remedy for the abundance of circulating money, with its consequent depreciation.  I have obtained, from Congress, leave to purchase two hundred gunlocks out of the public stores.(4) I have sent them to Hillsborough, and hope they will very soon be applied to the arms which are there preparing, and that the arms themselves will be put into the hands of soldiers, and sent to their proper places.  Opinions here are various with respect to the intended movements of the Enemy: 'tis certain however they have yet made none of any consequence. The officers in general are of opinion, they will attempt this city, and it seems determined to dispute it with them. This too is the prevailing opinion in Congress, and I am much pleased with the serenity and vigor with which we, at present, seem to regard objects of danger. Some of us, who are of a more martial cast, have gained the ascendancy so far that the timid are too fearful even to disclose their fears. I am pretty certain our next campaign will be active and interesting, if we are not disappointed in getting an army. The Northern, or what are usually called the New England, States are at present very languid: their troops do not at all come forward. Ticonderoga is in a very defenceless situation; and there appears very little reason to expect force there so soon as it will be wanting. We have no fresh intelligence from France, nor indeed have any vessels lately arrived from any part of Europe.  I am, Sir, exceedingly anxious to hear of our affairs in our own State: so uninformed as I am, I may perhaps consent to something that might do her an injury. I write very frequently to every part of the country, but never receive a line in answer. Except the letters from your Excellency dated in February, I have not received one from North Carolina since my arrival at Congress.  I wish I could be informed of the success of my request to be permitted to return in the summer, if the Assembly think proper to command my further attendance in this service: or whether they may not make choice of some more able man to fill the Department. I will detain you, Sir, no longer, only to declare that I am, with the greatest respect & esteem, your Excellency's most obedient Servant, Thos Burke  ""

  Dear Sir Philadelphia April 29th. 1777 If I were to consider punctilio more than the suggestions of friendship, I should expect an answer to some of the letters I have written you, before I dispatched another. But I ever hated ceremonies, and shall not APRIL 29, 1777  commence ceremony with you. I wish it were in my power to give you any very interesting news, but alas, the slow assembling of an Army prevents any attempt from us upon the enemy, and will furnish them an opportunity of collecting reenforcements from all quarters. The French Ministry assure our Commissioners that few succors can be drawn from Germany, but we find they are endeavoring to supply deficiencies from among the Tories in the States of Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey, where they have secret emissaries in abundance. For these purposes of corruption, it seems that Lord Howe is furnished with a Secretary, who is the greatest Adept in the art of bribing that now lives. I am afraid this Country furnishes too good materials for him to work upon. The plan of the British Court, if they can find Men and money and should not be disturbed by other wars, as it was settled in January last, was to reenforce Carleton and Howe, the latter to enter New England with his whole force for their extermination, whilst the former kept the middle Colonies in awe by invading N. York thro the Lakes. Burgoyne with 10,000 men chiefly Germans, to attack Virginia and Maryland. The Southern and Middle Colonies to be put under Military Government. This may be relied on as fact, and shews, if it wanted shewing, the just and merciful spi[rit] that animates the Leaders of our Enemies in Council. And I assure you, those that execute in the field are faithful representatives. It is on all hands agreed, that our own Tories are more formidable to us than the British force and that a few Leaders among these, are the Authors of all the mischeif. Quere then, if it becomes not every Legislature to secure against their machinations by the most vigorous and discouraging laws? I realy believe that numbers of our lazy, worthless young Men, will not be induced to come forth into the service of their Country unless the States adopt the mode recommended by Congress of ordering Drafts from the Militia.(1) This may induce the young and lazy to take the Continental bounty, rather than serve for nothing of that sort. If the 88 Batallions were once complete, adieu to British Tyranny and every chance for its succeeding.  Howes Army still remains on the Heights near Brunswick and Gen. Washington to occupy the Country round him.  Farewell dear Sir. Regard me as your affectionate friend,  Richard Henry Lee ""

  Philada. April 29th 1777 In Marine Committee.  It being this day determined to form a plan for intercepting the Jamaica Fleet that will Sail from that Island for Great Britain about the 26th day of July next, Resolved  That this Committee will Order such of the Continental Frigates and Cruizers as can conveniently be spared or appointed for this service to Randevouz at Abacoa One of the Bahama Islands near to New Providence on or before the 25th day of July next.  That as it is uncertain what number or which of the ships or Cruizers may be so Ordered, those that arrive at the said Station are to wait until APRIL 29, 1777  the 28th day of July, each employing themselves in taking on board wood, Water &c if wanted and to be got until that day when the several Commanders are to meet and producing their Commissions to each other the Senior officer is to be deemed Commodore and may hoist a broad Pennant during the continuance of this service. The Commodore and every Commander are then to pay due obedience to the following Instructions exerting themselves in their respective stations to execute them and to accomplish what this Committee have in view.  The grand Object of this expedition being to intercept the Jamaica fleet that will be departing from that Island about the Time the Commodore assumes his Command, he is to hold a Council of war assisted by all the Commanders and determine the following points.  First where is the best Cruizing Ground. Second, How to station the Squadron over that ground so that the enemies fleet cannot pass by unobserved.  Third, fix Signals for discovering the Enemy, their numbers, force and Number of the Convoy, how they bear. distance &c.  Fourth, fix Signals for knowing each Other generally, & each ship in particular with all other necessary & proper Signals for the well governing & managing the fleet during the Cruize and in time of action.  Fifth, each Commander to be supplied with a Copy of these orders, Copies of the Proceedings of the Council of War, Signals &c and copies of such other orders as the Commodore & council may think proper to be given to each captain in addition to these Instructions which orders are to have the same object in veiw and are to be calculated for the more effectual accomplishment of it. The Commodore or Council of war are empowered to order or do any thing they may think necessary or essential to enable the Squadron to perform the intended service, whether pointed out by the Committee or not. The Commodore must call on each Captain for any intelligence he may have gamed respecting our enemies before he arrived at the Randevouz and particularly respecting the Jamaica fleet, the force and number of Ships of war intended as Convoy to that fleet, and proper advantage must be made of any intelligence so gained. These things done and the sooner they are accomplished the better, the Squadron must weigh and sail under the Signals and Orders of the Commodore to the appointed Station which we suppose will be near the Havannah and as there will be some time to wait for the Jamaica fleet geting that length such time cannot be better spent, than in repeating the Signals agreed on constantly in order that they may become familiar to every one, and whenever they appear to be misunderstood to any Ship or Ships an explanation should immediately take place. The men should be constantly exercised at the Guns, and infinite pains taken on board every Ship to sweeten the air, and keep not only the ship clean but the Men so in their Cloathing and Persons. During this   Cruize there is little doubt but Prizes will be taken by the Squadron before the Jamaica fleet appears and such may be sent into Georgia or Carolina, but in doing this care must be taken that no ship is much weakened by sending away their men in such Prizes. Should they be of little value it may probably be best to burn them and encourage the Seamen found on board to enter our Service by offering them share of Prize Money to be taken, Pay and allowance equal to those already engaged and assurance of good treatment. It may not be amiss for the Commodore to send One of the small Cruizers into the Havannah with a Polite Letter to the Governor asking leave for the Ships of war belonging to the United states of America to send in their Prizes there until convenient to bring them away or for sale if that will be permitted. When the main object of this enterprize appears the Jamaica Fleet, it must be the business of the Commodore to keep the Frigates together until he finds out the strength of the Convoy and if it be such as he judges he can cope with, with a tolerable prospect of success, He is to make the proper disposition for Attacking to the best advantage and engage their ships of war whilst all the smaller vessells are employed in attacking and taking the Merchantmen. It must be remembered that the enemy generally send home for Convoy such of their ships of war as have been long in the West Indies. They are frequently foul and ill manned which are circumstances favourable for engaging them, even if they should appear of superior force. If you can but make Prizes of the Convoy or any part of them, we think it will then be in the power of the Squadron to take any number of the Merchantmen and such as cannot be manned and brought into Port may be sunk or Burned. Should the Convoy consist of such or so many Ships as it would be folly or rashness to engage, the Squadron in that case had best to seperate and hover after the fleet, for as we have little doubt but most of our ships will outsail theirs, being cleaner you may in this manner pick up a vast many of their Merchant ships altho protected by Superior force, and for this purpose every ship or Cruizer may follow the fleet as long and as far as the Commander shall think prudent, but the Squadron is not to seperate until the Commodore shall give orders or make signals for that purpose. If the Squadron seperate in this manner each Commander will return into the first safe Port in the States after he has performed his Cruize and rendered his Country all the services he can for that voyage, each giving us immediate notice of his Arrival and preparing again the Vessel he commands for further service against he receives fresh Orders. On the Contrary if the Squadron are successful in taking a number of Prizes it will be best to bring them into the first safe Port or Ports in these states delivering the Prizes to the Agents, and each Ship to be got ready for further services immediately. If the fleet arrive any where in the neighbourhood of Congress we can and will transmit fresh Orders-  if too distant the Commodore must call a Council of war of all the Commanders with him and any enterprize or expedition planned by that Council, that has for its object the service of the united states of America, to distress or disable the enemies of these states or to Capture their ships of war or Merchantmen will meet our Approbation & if executed with vigour will merit the praise of all America. Our ships should never be Idle. The Navy is in its infancy and a few brilliant strokes at this CEra would give it a Credit and importance that would induce seamen from all parts to seek the employ for nothing is more evident than that America has the means and must in time become the first Maritime power in the world. The several commanders employed to execute this Plan now laid down will have an opportunity to open the first Ideas of the importance of our Navy and a glorious chance of immortalizing their own names besides inriching all the brave Fellows under their command. To them then under Heaven we look for that success which is the Object of our wishes.(1)  ""

You know that the largest and most valuable fleets of Jamaica Sugar Ships always depart from that Island about the 26th day of July under Convoy and that they pass through the Gulph on their way to England.

  Gentlemen April 29th. 1777 Should you see this Letter it will be forwarded to you by Thomas Thompson Esqr. Commander of the Raleigh Frigate in the Service of the United States of America. This Ship was built in New Hampshire where is no Foundreys for Casting Cannon and the distance from the places where they are Cast to Portsmouth where the frigate now lies is so great that we think it better to put on board such Guns as can be got for her in the neighbourhood and send her to France to be compleated, than to Hall them by Land such an amazing distance, or than to trust them by Water to her, or her along the Coast to them, now that the enemies Ships are so numerous and powerful at the Mouths of our Bays and Harbours. We have ordered her to Brest as the most suitable Port for supplies. Captain Thompson will transmit you an Indent of all the Guns, Stores and Materials he wants and we hope you may procure an order for his being Supplied out of the Kings arsenals or Stores. Orders are given to the Commercial Agents to pay your drafts for the amount of such Supplies, but if you cannot obtain them in the way proposed, you will write to the Said Agents William Lee & Thomas Morris Esqrs. to purchase every thing necessary on the best terms and in the most expeditious manner they can.

  Sir April 29th 1777 We have long been anxious to hear of the Raleigh frigate under your Command being compleated for the sea but hitherto the dificulty of obtaining her Guns has been insuperable. You may rest assured that the measures you have taken to obtain them from the Furnace in Massachusets Bay are quite agreeable to us. We approve very much of the Iron Ballast being taken from the Alfred, and in case that should not be sufficient you are authorized to take a quantity out of the Columbus so much of her Iron Ballast as may be necessary and shall defray such reasonable Charges as attend the doing of it. and further we are well pleased that Mr Paine and Mr Bradford came into this measure and gave you their assistance. You are therefore to return to the furnace in APRIL 29, 1777  Massacusets Bay and immediately try or prove the Guns already cast for the Raleigh agreeable to the standard or mode given you herewith. If you find they stand this proof urge the utmost expedition in compleating the set. We hope a sufficient quantity of the proper Metal will be got from the Ballast of the Two Ships mentioned, but if that falls short you may then make application in our name and produce these orders to the Council or assembly of Massachusets Bay to spare you what may be wanting from the quantity lately sent them from Maryland and we will pay for or replace it. We expect and hope that you will get a compleat set of good Guns for the ship by these means, and if you do you must take the most effectual means to get them on board as expeditiously as possible. Apply to Mr. Langdon the Agent to second and support your endeavours and compleat the Complement of Hands, take in the necessary Stores, Provisions, Arms & ammunition for a Six Months Cruize if they can conveniently be had-if not you must be content with less- make the ship as compleat as you can but don't loose time or lavish away Money. Expedition and Vigilance are excellent qualities in a Sea Officer. Frugallity is an absolutely necessary One in all men that are connected with the American Revenue. These things duly attended to proceed as soon as you can on a Cruize. The first thing after you get out to sea is to try your Ships sailing. If she goes fast you may venture to take liberties with our enemies, if she does not you must keep clear of those of superior force and many of these we fancy will be found on the American Coasts. We hope you will be at Sea by the Month of June and if so your first Cruize had best be employed in seeking the Enemies Transports and Provision Vessels bound in for New York chusing the best station for falling in with them, and as you make Prizes send them into the first safe Port to the care of the Continental Agent. Thus you may employ the ship until the first of July when you are to open the sealed Instructions that we shall send you in a very short Time.(1) Those Instructions will direct your attention to an object of importance and you must keep the Raleigh in good order, well manned, clean, and in every Shape fit for Action or as much so as possible against that time. The said Instructions will point out your business after that date, therefore we now return to the supposition of your not geting the Guns wanted from the Furnace in Massachusetts Bay. If it so happens that you cannot get the whole there get as many as you can that will stand the proof, and apply to the State of Massachusets to furnish what may be wanting, if they cannot, then apply to Mr Paine or Mr Bradford to assist you in purchasing as many good 12, 9 or 6 pounders as will fill your Ports. You may do this either in Rhode Island, Massachusets or New Hampshire wherever you can suit the ship best and cheapest, get the whole on board with expedition, take in suitable Stores and ammunition, make up the Complement of about 150 men including Marines and take the first favourable opportunity to go   out to Sea and push off the Coast. Should any of the Continental frigates or Cruizers be in your neighbourhood write to the Captains and if inferior in Rank to you, order him or them to come and Convoy you off; if superior inform him it is our Orders that he or they do it for which this shall be his or their justification and you may send him or them Coppies of this Paragraph which he or they are hereby required to obey. When you get fairly out to Sea and are but thus partially armed, you must make the best of your way for Brest in France taking care on the Passage to avoid large Ships of war, but we hope you will take some Prizes from the Enemy and carry them in with you, these to be sold and the Continental share of such Prizes must be sold to pay for Guns, stores and charges. On your arrival at Brest write to William Lee & Thomas Morris Esqrs. at Nantes and to the Honble Dr Benjamin Franklin, Silas Deane and Arthur Lee Esqrs. in Paris informing them of your arrival and that your errand to France is to compleat the ship with a proper set of Guns telling them how many and the different sorts, mention also what other Stores and supplys you will want and request them to inform you whom to value on, and to take effectual measures to prepare with expedition all the supplies you need, on this head you must never cease urging them until you get what you want. When you get the proper Guns, strike the others in your Hold and keep them there until your return to America. You may ask the Honble Dr Franklin, Silas Deane & Arthur Lee Esqrs. if they have any commands for you and if they desire you to go on any particular service, Cruize or expedition you must obey their orders. If they have nothing particular you will take in water, Provisions &c for a long voyage and leaving Brest proceed on a Cruize-taking of Prizes and distressing the enemy must be the object of your Cruize but particularly we recommend your looking out for some of their East India Ships. You will find the Ports of France and Spain open to your Prizes with liberty of selling them there. You must be careful to keep your ship well manned, and whenever you take Prizes give great encouragement to Seamen and Petty officers to enter.  Any Prizes you take with Cloathing (particularly Blankets), arms, ammunition or any of those articles that you think will be particularly useful in America should be sent for the first safe Port in these states. We do not object to your Cruizing a reasonable time in the European seas provided our Commissioners at the Court of France are of opinion it will be more useful than returning, otherways you will return back for these Coasts Cruizing on the enemies Ships during the passage, and should you think it proper to call at any of the French Islands for information we have no objection. You must make it a point to encourage Seamen to enter our service wherever you meet with them. Use your People well but preserve strict discipline, attend most carefully to keep a clean ship or  the Men will grow sickly, treat Prisoners with Humanity and upon all occasions support with spirit the Honor of the American flag.  We are sir your friends & servants  ""

  Sir, Philadelphia, April 29th, 1777 In our last, we hinted at the want of vigour and Exertion in this State. We wish it was in our power to assure you that an effectual Remedy had been applied; but though the Enemy is daily expected an astonishing langour prevails, and the embodying a competent Force to oppose the meditated invasion, seems to be a distant Object. The Seat of this disease is not an Indifference to the Cause, for the whigs are sufficiently numerous to defend their Country against any army that can at present be brought against it. The unhappy Dispute about their Constitution is the fatal Rock on which they have split, and which threatens them with Destruction. We ardently wish that in our own State the utmost Caution may be used to avoid a like calamity. Every wise Man here wishes that the establishment of new Forms of Government had been deferred: they see that the Union, vigour and Security derived from Conventions and committees are not to be found in any State under its new Constitution.  We have hitherto left the subject of our instructions untouched- but in the course of a few days they shall be introduced.(1) To become acquainted with the persons and characters of the members requires some time, and is of great importance. We find several of our House desirous to know the merits of our Claim. Congress, from your past letters, have a Right to expect a representation; and we wait with Impatience for the reports and Maps, to elucidate our boundary.  Colonel Varrick gives General Schuyler a disagreeable account of the Disaffection prevailing in Albany County. General Gates writes in warm terms to Congress on the same Subject.(2) We wish to know the particulars, and the Means which Convention pursues for the Suppression of this dangerous Spirit. It is of Moment to our State that we receive the earliest Intelligence of every material Occurrence which can excite curiosity or animadversion, especially since the change in the Military Command. General Gates is far from being partial to our State. You cannot be at a  APRIL 30, 1777  Loss for the Reason. Our Revolters seem to possess his Esteem: he was in their councils here, and has left a most extraordinary recommendation in their Favor, which, if we are at liberty, shall be communicated. He mentions that he has ordered 500 troops into Albany. Is this in concert with the Convention or Committee, and founded on good reasons? For when we are beyond measure distressed for troops, it must be an urgent necessity indeed which can justify detaining so large a number in that City. In the critical circumstances of our Northern Frontiers, give us leave to suggest the Propriety of having a Committee of your House on the Spot, to represent the State, watch over its Enemies, and secure its reputation against Intrigue and Calumny, and above all, to take Care that in Case of any Misfortune to the Northward, our respectable Constituents may neither deserve or suffer Reproach.  We are, with the utmost Regard Sir, Your most obedient, humble servants, Phil. Livingston,  Jas. Duane, Wm. Duer.  ""

Instant. that it did not appear to the House that the Removal of the salted Meat from Derby and the three other places mentioned in the Resolve would put you to any Inconveniency. If you should be under the Necessity of marching into that part of New York on the East Side of Hudsons River, Connecticut or the Massachusetts Bay a Supply of the Meat Kind can be furnished from or in the two last mentioned States and Flour in or from the former. That the Wheat mentioned in the fourth Resolve should remain where it is to be thence sent into the more interior part of the Massachusetts Bay, should the Enemy attempt a Debarkation in any of the Eastern States, and thereby render it necessary to keep Up an army in that Quarter. The fifth Resolution was founded on a Conviction that there is a Sufficiency of Flour in the District mentioned for the Support of the Northern Army. These being the general principles on which the Resolutions I have quoted were founded, the others in a Manner follow of Course.  Inclose your Excellency Copy of a Return of the Wheat and Flour now in the County of Albany exclusive of what is purchased for the use of the army, which is very considerable.  I propose, in a Day or two, to resign my Commission, as soon as I have done it I shall transmit to your Excellency my Reasons for such a Step.  Inclose your Excellency Colonel Wood's Return. I have attempted, ever since my last, to procure a Return of the Troops in this City, but hitherto in vain. I am however promised it to Day, and shall transmit your Excellency a Copy by the first Conveyance. I believe they amount to about eleven hundred many of which wait for Cloathing and accoutrements & others move to Bristol to Day.

  My Dear Bror. No. 11 Philadelphia 30 Apl 1777 My last acknowledged the receipt of such of Yours as have come to hand, I thot I had wrote you that I wish'd to be releav'd by the Middle of May, if I did not mention it to you, I certainly did to some body else for that has been my constant wish. My Colleague will not be very Cerimonious, he will set out in a few days, but I shod think myself inexcusable in leaving the State unrepresented at this Critical & important day, but my Health absolutely requires a Respite which I hope will be given me soon. It is very Unfortunate that Guns cannot be procur'd for the Ships, but I still hope the Raleigh will be supplied from the Furnice lately Erected in the Massachusetts, but why may we not have a Furnice in New Hampshire. I have heard there is a large Quantity of ore in Barrington, at no great distance from water carriage & streams suitable for Erecting works on, abound in that Country, & there is a Sufficiency of wood to supply a Furnice for many years, if the Proprietor of the land, nor the State will undertake to erect works, it wod be worth while for the Continent to do it provided the Ore is suitable for Cannon & the land could be obtain'd on reasonable terms. The American Navy will be increasing & I know of no place so suitable for Building ships as Piscataqua River & it wod be very convenient to have the Guns made near where the Ships are  APRIL 30, 1777  Built. This is a matter worthy Consideration, I wish you wod pay some attention to it & let me know if its probable any thing can be done.  Inclos'd you have Invoice of 10 bbs flour on board the Friends Adventure half of which I intended for you. As you had the trouble of fiting out those two vessels for Baltimore I suppose you will have the selling of the flour as greatest part of it will be for sail. The Army is increasing 'tho not so fast as I could wish. I cannot accot for the inactivity of the Enemy unless it is their weakness. I must refer you to Capt Thompson for news as perhaps he may collect some in his way home, at present there is none here 'tho we are in daily Expectation of a Packet from France, which no doubt will bring very interesting intelligence. The Bays of Delaware & Chesepeake are still infested by the Enemies ships, which makes the navigation very Hazerdous. Many of our merchantmen fall into their hands and some Privateers have been taken by them, in Perticular a Brig. mounting 16 Guns belonging to South Carolina Commanded by Tho. Pickering. The Culture of Hemp is a matter worthy of attention, I think if our Legislatures were to give suitable encouragement for that purpose, very good consequences might result therefrom, I just throw out the hint leaving it for those who have more leasure to form the Plan.

The affair is delicate in its Nature & so considered by Congress, who, while they are fully satisfied with your Conduct, wish to avoid the Inconveniences arising from the precedent; which You will doubtless assist them in, by explaining the Matter to the inquisitive, or what is preferable, saving ( Yourself ) as far as possible the Necessity of this Measure.  We have this Day received from your Quarter the Agreable Information of the 12,000 Arms & 50 Tons of Powder & Clothing which arrived at Portsmouth; (2) in addition to which I have the pleasure to inform You that 6800 fire arms with Bayonets arrived in this River last Week together with 2100 Gunlocks and 31 Tons powder at Baltimore.  We have also a Letter from Doctor Franklin, Doctor Lee, & Mr Deane at Paris, Where Things wear a most favourable Aspect.(3) Thus much I may venture to communicate; the (Collective Body) people of France are enthusiastic for America; two Millions of Livres are offered to the Commissioners by private Gentlemen without either Interest or Security; the Cry is general for a Declaration of War against England; 30 Sail of Ships of the Line in France & as many in Spain were to be ready for the Sea by the beginning of April; 10000 Troops were ordered to march for Brest, the Destination of which was unknown; the Court of Great Britain had meanly solicited the Allies of France to guarantee Hanover against any Attack thro the Summer, & were refused; four Regiments were Raising in the prince of Hesse's Dominions, & in Consequence of Draughts on his Subjects an Insurrection took place; All the ports of France, Spain & Italy are open to Us upon the principles of neutrality; all Europe are in Favour of America, Russia & Portugal excepted & the little powers who have heretofore assisted G. Britain.  I wish to have it communicated to our Friends in Boston, that the  Tories in Philadelphia industriously circulate to their Disadvantage that there are few Whigs to be found in that once eminently patriotic Metropolis; & many Gentlemen who are Friends to the Cause confirm the report so far as to acknowledge, \""that the Tories take possession of the most public places, & with great assurance express their Sentiments to the Disadvantage of our Cause.\"" Will this be suffered by a people who have hazarded every Thing, & suffered so much in Support of their rights?

Mr. Gibbon was taken prisoner in Character of a private Soldier belonging to a Company of Militia commanded by one Captn. Mashall of Col.

  Sir May 1st 1777 You will see by the resolutions sent to you at this time that new Ideas are taking place here in regard to the western side of Tyconderoga.(1)  I apprehend you will be better informed than we are what expectations you can form with confidence about the number of eastern troops and the exact time when they will arrive to a certain necessary amount for your plans. An absolute order to relinquish the western Lines & fort was pushed for, but you find did not prevail. You certainly have not such a predilection for them as to run great risques of losing yr. Reputation in their defence with a few troops, if only a few can be had. Nor are you of such a disposition as to leave them without much consideration, if they appear to be highly essential to our defence, and you receive according to yr. wishes troops & military stores. If, after the liberty which is given to you, stores to a considerable amount and a number of men should be taken from you on the western side you will never hear the last of it. On this, I speak strongly, not fearing that I shall deter yr. Judgment & Spirit from deciding justly according to circumstances on the spot of deliberation.  But, another matter besides the foregoing will be upon yr. mind, on which you will expect to hear from me by this bearer.  The affairs to the northeast are in a critical situation for the state of N. York in particular. Disaffection, as you see, is greatly prevalent; and those who profess well to our cause judge & say that there is but one single man who can keep their subjects united against the common enemy; and that he(2) stands on our books as commandr. in chief in the middle, or, as it is sometimes called, the northern departmt; that his presence is absolutely necessary in his home quarters for their immediate succour & service as well as that of the united states necessarily connected; that if he returns, he is a Genl. without an army or a Military Chest; And, \""why is he thus disgraced\""?  It is said that it is nonsense to give you the command of the northern army at Tyconderoga and confine you to that fort and mount Independence where you cannot have an extensive idea of the defence of the frontier of the eastern states, but only of one spot where the enemy are not obliged to confine their operations, and, as it were knock their heads ag-ainst a single Rock. And if you are not so confined you intirely destroy the idea of their Chief to whom they profess devotion un- MAY 1, 1777  bounded. How this matter will be untangled I can not now exactly determine, but I suspect not intirely agreable to yr. sentiments. I wish to have these explicitly & minutely by the first opportunity after the receipt of this. I wish some course coud be taken which would suit you both. It is plain that all the northern army can not be intended for the single Garison of Ty. Who then has the distribution of the Numbers? This must depend upon one opinion or their can be no decision in the defence of the northern frontiers. It is an unhappy circumstance that such is the altercation at the opening of this campaign so early by the foreign enemies of these states.

We have the pleasure to assure yr. Excellency that Congress were Unanimous in expressing their warmest disapprobation  MAY 1, 1777  of Capt.

  Dear Sir Philada. May 1st. 1777 I have seen with a good deal of Concern what appears to me an unfortunate dispute between your Excellency and Capt Nicholson in Consequence of his having followed the example of his Brother officers who have for sometime been Impressing men into the Naval Service of the Continent in this Port.  The practice of Impressing Seamen cannot be supported on any other MAY 1, 1777  principle than Necessity and I am confident it is as pernicious to the Commercial Interests of a Country as destructive of the Civil Liberty of those Individuals who become its Victims. Under these opinions you will readily see I camlot advocate the measure. Nothing but the prospect of great Public advantages to result from a well manned navy would have induced me to be silent whilst these things were doing here, but it was properly the business of the Executive power of the State to notice & stop the practice. They have not interfered & that probably because they saw & Considered the force of Necessity. Perhaps no great disadvantages might have resulted to the State of Maryld had you only checked this business so far as it had come before you by Complaints from Individuals whose particular situations or Circumstances might have called for exemption & protection. Remember I don't offer these as fixed Sentiments or as proper considerations in a settled peaceable Government, because I know they are inconsistant with it but in times of Invasion & War, especially such a War as ours, it seems to me that forcing out Militia against their will which I believe to have been much practiced is an equal infringement of Liberty with the Impressing of Men for a limited time for the Naval service & it is to be observed that it has hitherto been the practice at the end of every Cruize or Voyage made by our Continental Ships the men have had their liberty again. In the British Navy they are generally impressed for Life. Thus much in Paliation only. With respect to Capt Nicholson he certainly deserves severe reprehension, the terms of his letter are quite unwarrantable & not a single member of Congress offered to support him. You will see that the Resolves of Congress place him in your power so far as he values his Commission (1) & at present he is at the head of the American Navy but I think the dispute unfortunate because I have been taught to believe him an excellent & Capable officer, the loss of such a one will be a real misfortune to the Continent & yet I think he ought to be dismissed unless by satisfactory submission he attones for the offensive Stile of his letter which I suppose to have been written in warmth inflamed by the Violence of that Species of Whiggism that savours more of passion than true Patriotism, I am told he is of a high Spirit and that it is doubtful if he will make the Concessions he ought. I wish not to be guilty of an improper interferance & shall only repeat that if he was dismiss'd the service it will be a heavy loss, especially as the next in Command (Capt Manly) is vastly his inferiour in abilities, & knowing as I do how much your Excellency wishes to promote the Service of America, I coud not refrain from mentioning my notions on this Subject. There is also another matter that gives me concern & that is the detention of Continental Troops on the Eastern Shoar to keep Tories in order at a time when Genl Washington cou'd strike a Capital stroke was he reinforced by those & others that ought to join him. I wish you wou'd   think of this & order them to march on, other means may be found to keep the Tories in order there, you will merit & require the thanks of the continent if you think proper to improve this hint, the resolve of Congress for detaining them was obtained in consequence of your letter to me on that Subject.(2) The arms that came on the Ship blown up at our Capes I am told were pretty generally damaged in the explosion,(3) the Continent had 2500 on board & for your State 500, but the Packages are all blown to pieces and the Muskets mixed, therefore of what is saved we must receive in proportion & I am now sending for the whole to this City to have them put in order & divided, that done I will inform your Excellency or the Council of Safety & deliver what I receive as my proportion to their order.  The Continent also recd when at Balto 52 bbls of the Powder I imported for your State, supposing it theirs, I will get an order for it & send the same down, for I think that Powder is still at Baltimore.

They have no Commissions and they say Government engaged to send them to this Place and if they are taken without they will be treated as private Soldiers. I could wish they might be satisfied.(1)  Congress being informed to Day by Genl. Schuyler that 100 Men of Colo.

I have not seen or heard it. Mr. Smith has but does not remember it well enough to give a particular Acct.  The Enemy are landing their Cannon &c on Staten Island supposed to be for an Attack on this Town. This Dr. Witherspoon hath this Day received Advice off.

A mere Proteus in principle, he makes virtue subservient to his vices; to cover the multitude of the latter he affects to be possessed of the former. With the loudest clamorings for Liberty he would ruin the Country whose cause he pretends to advocate; and with the warmest declaration of Friendship he would stab the most virtuous of Characters. Counteract one machination and he will have recourse to another. Disgrace him for discovered crimes, he will seek a palliation and founds a reestablishment in the delusions of Patriotism. Has he not deserted all parties with which he was ever known to be engaged? Has he ever professed a friendship (save one perhaps [Lyman Hall]) but to betray? (3) Did he not consent to put you at the head of a Regiment when he could not keep it himself with a premeditated intention to ruin you? Did he not betray the trust of his Country when he was here [Philadelphia] respecting arms and ammunition for the second & third Battalions of Georgia Troops & Denying me the necessary support in getting them sent from hence or procuring an order on our Agent in Martinique to send a Vessel to Georgia with them, either of which could have been obtained.

Thinking the continent, the State & myself ill used in this business I mentioned the matter with all the attendant circumstances in a public letter(5) to my late worthy friend Mr President Bulloch who I am informed sent the letter to the convention.

  Sir Philadelphia May 2d 1777 I wrote you the day before yesterday by an Express going to Charlestown, and after I had sealed up the letter, some intelligence was opened in Congress, which I wrote on a slip of paper and put into the cover. I doubt not you will receive it.(1)  Mr Cochran of Cross Creek going home to day gives me an opportunity of giving you all the intelligence relative to that affair, which has been a little mischievous, and threatens consequences much more considerable than have happened. The inclosed paper contains the whole, as it was laid before Congress; except a few expressions of General Arnold, complaining of the behaviour of the Connecticut Militia, and of the supineness of the country which suffered such an insult without resistance or proper revenge. You will easily perceive that publishing such things would have no good effect.(2)  As Mr Cochran sets off at three to-day, and I shall be all the intermediate time engaged in Congress, I shall not have time to write by him to any friend who may be in the Assembly. I must therefore entreat you to give the members of Assembly this intelligence in the most public manner you can.  An insulting letter written by the Captain (3) of one of the Continental Frigates to the Governor of Maryland has excited great indignation in Congress. The Officer is suspended, and ordered in five days to make such satisfaction as the Governor and Council shall accept, or, failing, to be dismissed the service Every Gentleman ( a few only excepted ) seemed to feel his own State injured in this insult, and they were determined that nothing less should do, than what would satisfy Maryland, and convince Officers that they were very far inferior to the MAY 2, 1777  Magistrates of States, and must treat them with the most profound respect. I never had more hopes of Congress than I have now. All seem sensible that the honour and dignity of the Magistrates of the States ought to be preserved sacred and inviolable; whether for applying the force of the States, or restraining abuses, and suppressing ambition.  Your Excellency knows enough of my political creed to believe that this disposition is exceedingly pleasing to me. I have not time to add more, but that I have the honor to be, Your &c,  Thos Burke ""

  Gentlemen No. 1 In Committee for Foreign Affairs  The former of those Letters will serve to shew that at the Time of writing them we had nothing material to inform you of, and are now sent rather for your Amusement than instruction. Philadelphia May 2d. 1777  Your dispatches dated Paris Feby 6th & 8th were safely recd about the middle of April. (1) We observe your Remarks on the Timerousness of the French Merchants respecting the forming Trading Companies which you say is occasioned by the change and fluctuation of News. That the Spirit for trade will always be governed by the rise or fall of Military strength is a maxim always to be admitted in the first attempts to establish a Commerce between any two Nations, because success in War is supposed to give Security or Protection to it; But this timidity ceases naturally as soon as a trade is opened for losing or gaining after that equally produces a Spirit of adventuring farther; Therefore, we wish to enter into a Commerce with them as soon as possible because as nothing can abridge or prevent their Profits but the Enemy making Prizes of their Vessels, the consequence will be, that they will either be encouraged by the gain, or aggravated by the loss to come to a Serious understanding with the Court of Britain. We advise you to be con- MAY 2, 1777  stantly holding up the great advantages which the Crown and Commerce of France would receive by possessing themselves of the West Indies, and We Trust to your Wisdom in making all the use possible of the English Newspapers as a channel thro' which to counteract the Tide of folly and falsehood of which you complain and rest assured that every Material Circumstance either for or against will be dispatched to you with the utmost expedition.  By Information from N York it appears that the more discerning part of the English Generals begin to give up the thought of Conquest, and of Consequence the fear of totally losing the trade of America must accompany the despair of Arms, therefore we conceive that the English Papers are calculated to deter the French merchants from beginning to taste the sweets of our Trade. Their falsehoods rightly understood are the Barometers of their fears, & in Proportion as the Political Atmosphere presses downward the spirit of Fiction is obliged to rise. We wish it to be understood that we pay too much respect to the Wisdom of the French Cabinet to suppose they can be influenced by such efforts of Visible despair, and that We have too much reverence for the Honor of the American Congress to prostitute its authority by filling our own Newspapers with the same kind of invented Tales which characterise the London Gazette.  We observe that General Howe in his Letter to administration printed in London Gazette of Decr. 30th apologizes for not having written to them since his taking possession of New York (nearly three months). Here is the proper field to speculate on Silence, because his business is conquest, ours, defence and repulse, and because likewise he has the sea more open to him than we have, had he any thing to send that would please; therefore silence on his part is always to be understood as a species of good news on ours.  The Congress highly approves your dividing yourselves to foreign Courts, and have sent Commissions for that Purpose and likewise Commissions for fitting out Privateers in France.(2) The Mercury from Nantz is safely arrived at Hampsh., the Amphitrite and Seine we are yet in hopes of.(3) We shall Notice the Conduct of Nicholas Davis. We have presented Marshal Maillebois Sentiments on the Mode of War to Congress who are greatly pleased therewith and entertain a high respect for the Author.(4)  Our last Accounts gave you the State of News down to March since which nothing material has happened. The Enemy wearied and disappointed in their Winters Campaign still continue in a State of dormancy at N York and Brunswick. The Congress is Returned to Philadelphia, Genl Washington remains at Morris Town and occupies the same Posts as when the last dispatches were sent you. The Principal object now is the Recruiting Service which has been greatly promoted by some late Resolves of Congress. Our Troops have been under inocula-  tion for the Small Pox with good Success which Purgation we hope will be a means of preserving them from fevers in the Summer, however it will frustrate one cannibal Scheme of our Enemies who have constantly fought us with that disease by introducing it among our Troops.  When we look back to the beginning of last December and see our Army reduced to between two and three thousand men occasioned by the Expiration of the Time for which they were engaged, we feel ourselves exceedingly happy in Contemplating the agreeable Condition and prospect our affairs are now in, we have since that Period reduced the Enemy more than our whole Army at that time consisted of, and scarce a day passes in which they do not suffer either by Skirmishes or desertions.  The Congress have it in Contemplation to remove the Garrison from the present fort in the district of Ticonderoga to fort Independance in the same district which they judge will command that pass with greater advantage and is a much healthier Situation. We mention this as the Enemy will probably give an Air of Triumph to the evacuation should it be done. The distance between the two is about a quarter of a Mile.(5)  As Genl Howe is preparing a Bridge of Boats we think it possible that he might by a sudden and forced march, reach this City, but we are clearly of opinion that he would be ruined by the Event, and tho' we are not under much apprehension of such a movement yet we think it proper to give you the Case with our opinion thereon.

  Dear Gent. Philad. 2d May 1777  The principal design of this is to recommend to your Attention Col.

And if the Eastern States are not more deficient there will still be a formadable army; especially as some Battalions are much more compleat.  We shall write to Congress soon & shall then endeavour to be more particular with respect to the Levies and foreign Intelligence.

But if France engaged, Spain will and then all Europe will arrange themselves on one side and the other, and what Consequences to Us might be involved in it, I dont know. If We could have a free Trade with Europe, I should rather run the Risque of fighting it out with George and his present Allies, provided he should get no other. I dont love to be intangled in the Quarrells of Europe, I dont wish to be under Obligations to any of them, and I am very unwilling they should rob Us of the Glory of vindicating our own Liberties .  It is a Cowardly Spirit in our Countrymen, which makes them pant with so much longing Expectation, after a French War. I have very often been ashamed to hear so many Whiggs groaning and Sighing with Despondency, and whining out their Fears that We must be Subdued unless France should step in. Are We to be beholden to France for our Liberties?  France has done so much already, that the Honour and Dignity and Reputation of Great Britain is concerned to resent it, and if she does not, France will trifle with her forever hereafter. She has recd our Ambassadors, protected our Merchant Men, Privateers, Men of War and Prizes-admitted Us freely to trade-lent Us Money and Supplied Us with Arms, Ammunition, and Warlike stores of every Kind. This is notorious all over Europe. And she will do more, presently, if our dastardly Despondency in the midst of the finest Prospects imaginable does not discourage her. The surest and the only way to secure her Arms in this Cause is for Us to exert our own. For Gods Sake then dont fail of a single Man of your Quota. Get them at any Rate, and by any Means, rather than not have them.  I am more concerned about our Revenue than the Aid of France. Pray let the Loan officers do their Part, that We may not be compelled to make Paper Money, as plenty and of course as cheap as Oak Leaves. There is so much Injustice in carrying on a war with a depreciating Currency that We can hardly pray with Confidence for success.  The Confederation has been delayed because the states were not fully represented. Congress is now full-and We are in the midst of it. It will soon be passed.  God prosper your new Constitution. But I am afraid you will meet the Disapprobation of your Constituents. It is a Pity you should be obliged to lay it before them. It will divide and distract them.

I hope you will not punish me too severely, by ceasing to let me know, now & then, what you are doing. We hear there are some appearances of the Enemy quitting the Jerseys, will you let them  MAY 3, 1777  get off unhurt? Considerable reinforcements are coming forward, near 2000 are now marching from hence.  Great exertions will be made against us this campaign, our exertions must be proportioned; but I am sure it will not avail us much to have numbers in the feild, if they are not under proper discipline, of which I almost despair, so very shamefull has been the conduct of our Officers for some months past. Unless the Generals take extraordinary pains & examine minutely into every particular relative to the troops, disease & despondency will make them an easy prey to the Enemy. Cleanliness in lodging & diet, just payments, and martial exercises will make them invincible. Tis true your troops are at present raw; but you may remember that Epaminondas soon bro't his disheartend Countrymen to beat the best troops, then in the world; by his excellent discipline, & frequent judicious skirmishes. I know I incur the ridicule of the Orator who discoursed of war before Hanibal but I cant help it, the subject lies too heavy upon my mind. The stake we play for is not a common one.  Tis a pity so many of our stores were laid up in that nest of Tories at Danbury & its environs; the loss will not easily be repaired, & the disgrace is injurious. These things hurt us exceedingly with our own people, & have a bad influence abroad. God send you may soon give us something to put on the other side of the Account.

Another Source of Discontent arises from the giving those Commissions Dated the 9th of April last to whom Commissions were before MAY 3, 1777  given by the Commissioners on the 10th Decr. 1776. They say they have been in the publick Service from that Time and it is hard they should lose both their Rank and Pay.  A like Complaint is made by such as were appointed by the Commissioners.

  Dr. Papa, Pha. 4th May 1777 I got here yesterday by the half hour after two. Before this reaches you will probably have heared of the expedition of the enemy into Connecticut. They have destroyed, it is said, between 4 & 5 thousand barrels of beef & pork & 25 hundred barrels of flour & some tents. The exact amount of the damage done is not yet known.  An advanced party of Carleton's army by the last accounts from Tionderoga was within 45 miles of that place I am afraid Carleton will be at Tionderoga before we can collect a force sufficient to defend those lines. In that case Gen. Gates will probably evacuate them & retire to fort independence on the eastern side of lake Champlain, & remove, if he has time, his canon & stores from the lines into  MAY 4, 1777  that fort. Congress have given discretionary orders to G. Gates to this effect. Yesterday evening we received the following agreeable intelligence from Boston which you may certainly rely on, as Mr. Morris has got the invoice of the goods. The ship Amphitrite is arrived at Portsmouth from France after a very long passage; she sailed from Havre some time in Novr. Among a variety of other articles she has brought the following: 53 brass field pieces (4 pounders) with all their necessary apparatus, a large assort. of ball, musket balls, primeers & intrenching tools, 6 thousand odd hundred muskets, a very great quantity of gun powder, & &c. Mr. John Adams informed me that several engineers & artillery men are come in the above vessel & that a Colonel Conway in the Irish brigade is also come in to offer his services to the united States.  Congress does not know the amount of G. Washington's army, and I believe the general himself does not know it. What Howe will do is uncertain-it is my opinion he will go up North River & try to join Carleton. A letter from Docr. Arthur Lee dated on his way to Madrid (the Date I can not learn) mentions that he had recd. a letter from a correspondent in England informing him that Gen. Burgoyne with ten thousand Germans & 3000 English was to attack Boston early this Spring, that the transports had already sailed to take the Germans on board. I believe it will be late in the year before this reinforcement arrlves.  Mr. Sam. Hanson will deliver you this letter. I think you will admire his lady; she is not only beautiful, but appears to be of a sweet & amiable temper. Molly & Mrs. Darnall & you will do all in yr. power to make her stay at Douhoragen agreeable. How many commissioned & noncommisioned officers do you imagine are in the pay of the united States? Not less than 10,000. It is said 18 hundred are in this city. Gen. Schuyler issued orders for them to attend him some day last week at the State house, 200 only complyed with the order. Perhaps the number of officers may be exaggerated, but it is agreed on all hands that there [are] many more than 200. What do you think I pay a week for my horse's food & stabling? Not less than £5.5.0 & £4 a week for mine & my servant's board. If the Congress sits after two o'clock I must dine at the Tavern; when it rises before 2 o'clock I shall dine at my lodgings. There is another ship arrived at Portsmouth with the above mentioned vessel & has brought 36 bales of cloth, 6 bales of blanketts & furniture for light horse. A vessel which sailed from Nantes with military stores is arrived at Martinico. The French in Martinico have applied to Congress for commissions to cruize agt. the English trade. Several commissions have been granted already I think these steps must inevitably draw on a war between France & England. The Congress have not recd. any late advices from Docr. Franklin or Dean. Docr. Lee is gone to Madrid. If we can stand this campaign I  MAY 5, 1777  think our independance will be secured. Carleton will, I am sure possess himself of our lines at Tionderoga, if he makes haste, & unless we can speedily collect an army at fort Independance on the east side of Lake Champlain opposite to Tionderoga, the Garrison of that fort consisting of 3000 under Gen. Wayne will I am afraid, fall into Carleton's hands, unless they retreat before he can invest them. I did intend to send this letter by Mr. Hanson, who will leave this city tomorrow to return home (he will take Douhoragen in his way) but as he will travel much slower than the post, and as I am desirous of your receiving the intelligence contained in this letter as early as possible I shall send it by Tuesday's post. I have seen several of our light horse. They really cut a good figure, & have a martial appearance, their horses (those I have seen) appear to be very good & are showy. If there should be any news of consequence before the post goes off, I will write again. My love to Molly & Mrs. Darnall. I am, yr. affectionate Son, Ch. Carroll of Carrollton ""

If We can Support these We can carry on the War with Vigour and probably with Success. But if We go on as We have We must suffer extream Distress. The Science of a Financier is to be learned only from Books or from Travels. I have Scarce a Moment to look into a Book and I never travelled. Some of our Bostonian Genius's who understand the Nature of Commerce and of Money must turn their Thoughts to those Subjects.  I think with you that We ought to negotiate with some foreign Power Loans of Cash; But this is at:tended with great Difficulty. We might possibly borrow, but there is a vast Risque in transporting the Money across the Sea.(2)  I know not what to say of the Lottery you say is in Contemplation. I dread the Effects of the Gambling Spirit that is abroad. Salt, Lead, Sulphur, Allum and Copperas are Articles of great Importance, but whether you cannot import them cheaper than you can make them (under all the Risques) I know not.  I wish you had informed me, how many Men of our Quota are raised and how many marched. We are suffering much for Want of Men. The surprises at Bound Brook, Peeks Kill and Danbury were all owing to this Cause. I hope and pray that our State will not fall a Man short of its Quota and that every Man will be sent to Ti and Morristown.  I Sincerely condole with you under Mrs Palmers Indisposition.

  Honourable Gentlemen, Philad. 6th May, 1777.  Nothing of sufficient moment has happen'd since our last Letter to deserve your Attention. The Troops from the Southward are filing down towards General Washington, tho' not in such Numbers as cou'd be wished. He will however be soon at the Head of a respectable Force able to meet General Howe if he does not receive a very considerable Accession from Europe or from the disaffected among ourselves. Much as it might gratify you, there is not a sufficient Certainty to justify a Conjecture of the General's present Strength. When it can be done you shall be advised.  The Accounts from our Commissioners (or if you please Ambassadors ) in France, Justify an Expectation that as well that Court as Spain will support the Americans in everything (at least) on this side of a Declaration of War. The Commissioners have procur'd very great Credit And for such Sums as leave it unquestionable that the Court of Versailles is at the Bottom their real Friend and privately supports their Applications. You may rely upon it that vast quantities of Artillery, Arms, Ammunition and Cloathing have been purchased on Credit for our use; no inconsiderable part of which is actually arrived. At the same time the French will in my Opinion be cautious of entering into an actual War till they find some decisive Advantage. When that approaches all Reserve will be laid aside. Great Brittain is at present in such humiliating Circumstances that she will bear every Insult rather than provoke a declaration of War. It was too great a condescention to hear the just Complaints of injur'd Americans ! It was Treason against their Dignity to examine into their own Abuse of Power, to rectify their own Errors! What is the Conduct of this haughty nation at this Period of her disgrace? From her natural and inveterate Enemy she must bear every thing inflicted upon her, and dares hardly to complain.

I should have immediately sent off all the accounts in my possession by an express, but as Genl. Schuyler then thought of returning in two or three days, with the advice of my colleagues, I thought best to defer it, it being judged a much safer opportunity. Several letters have of late been opened on the road, and persons seized by the disaffected; should these accounts have met with such a fate, the public must have suffered extremely. I am extremely sorry that the unavoidable delay of Genl. Schuyler has occasioned the detention of these papers, but should he not be able to leave this place in three days from this time, which he now expects, I shall convey them in the safest manner possible.  The present opportunity not being considered by Mr. Duane and Mr. Livingston, as altogether safe, I think it is not advisable to write on any matters of importance.  I shall content myself with observing that we have surveyed our ground, and that we have no doubt but we shall make a successful attack on the points recommended to us (2) The papers which I enclose you, will give you an insight into the news stirring here. The accounts of the arrival of the ship loaded with 52 field pieces and other ordnance, &c. may be depended upon. Her name is the Amphitrite, a 20 gun ship, chartered in France by Mr. Silas Deane.

Langdon with the dispatches that came in the Amphitrite.(1) This ship has been so long from France that she can bring nothing new. Another ship with a Similar cargo is arriv'd at Martineco after making several unsuccessful attempts to get into some of our ports. Some others are still expected, I wish they may not fall into the Enemies hands. It gives me Pleasure that a discovery is made of the Vilaneous money making scheme, for Heavens sake dont let the Villains escape the halter.(2) Sure I am they richly deserve it. Lenity to them will cost the lives of Thousands. It therefore is an indispensable duty to the Public to make examples of them. I beg leave to suggest whether it wod not be prudent to call in the money that is counterfited immediately. In Expectation that this plan will be adopted, I will endeavor to obtain an order on the loan office, to enable you to execute it. I have desir'd the Treasury to forward Proof sheets of every Emission which they promise me shall be done. Large quantities of Conterfit money has been sent out from N. York but I have not heard that any body has yet been deceiv'd by it. I am told its badly done.  Genl. Lee did not mention any perticular business. The copy of his letter which I sent you conveys every thing that I know respecting that matter.(3) The latest advices from France confirm me in the impropriety of his request, as the conference last summer was improv'd greatly to our disadvantage, that was a considerable means of preventing our having the stores last faul, that are now coming.  Colo. Thornton set out the 3d inst.(4) I endeavor'd to perswade him to tarry 'till Mr. Frost arriv'd, but without success. I hope I shall be excus'd if I leave this very soon after Mr. Frost arrives, for I assure you I am almost wore out. It has not been in my Power to mount my horse since I arriv'd from Baltimore, nor not more then twice while there. Without relaxation, & exercise, my constitution ('tho a-very good one) will not stand this climate. I think it absolutely necessary that the state shod be as fully represented as possible, therefore hope a second Person will soon be sent after Mr Frost.  I agree with you, that we have many Difficulties to Encounter but doubt not we shall be able to surmount them all. Our internal & Secret Enemies embarrass us much more then is in the Power of all the force that can be rais'd by Great Britain, & nothing but the most MAY 7, 1777  vigorous exertions of civil authority can free us from those difficulties. The Laws shod be severe & executed with Rigour. This measure properly persued will surely have a very salutary Effect. The whip, Pilory, & Gibet shod be exercis'd freely, & those that the Laws will not hang should be immediately Banish'd & their Estates Confiscated, for keeping them among us will still subject us to the inconveniences arrising from their wicked Machinations. It is no time now to trifle. We must know who is for & who is against us & seperate the goats from the sheep. I inclose you a paper that has the test establish'd by S.

  Sir, Philadelphia May 8th 1777 Inclosed is an Extract from a Letter written to the Committee of Correspondence by Arthur Lee Esqr. One of the Commissioners employed by the Congress at the Courts of France & Spain.(1) By this Extract the Necessity of destroying the British &c Forces on Rhode Island before they may be reinforced fully and strongly appears. Boston it seems is to be attacked. Which Way it is to be attacked, if attacked, is unknown. The Distance from Providence to Boston is about forty six Miles-Two Days March only. It hath been and still is my Opinion that, if the Enemy intend to penetrate into New England, One of their Routes will be from the Head of our Bay or near it. If the Assembly should agree with Me in this Sentiment, no Arguments will  MAY 8, 1777  be wanting to them, to comply with the Recommendation of Congress.(2) But should this not be the Case most certainly every possible Advantage ought to be taken of the divided State of the British Army to crush and destroy it.  In a late N. York Paper was published an Act of Parliament lately passed for apprehending, and imprisoning within the Realm of Britain, until January 1778, all Pirates & Traitors.(3) If I should be able to procure the Paper or a Copy of the Act before I close my Letter I will transcribe & transmit it to you. We must retaliate, and confine all the Prisoners We take. I fancy before the Campaign is out We shall be able to ballance Accounts with the Enerny. Recruits have come forward from the Southward very cleverly of late. I hope recruiting goes on in the Eastern States brisker than it did. The Quota of our State must not be deficient. The common Cause and our Reputation depend upon our Activity. The Enemy have used and are still using every Artifice they can, to increase Toryism, promote Desertions, and depretiate continental Dollars. Persons are employed in every State to propagate the first, Twenty four Dollars is offered for every Soldier that will desert and carry with him his Arms, a Less Sum for a Deserter without his Arms, to promote the Second; and to depretiate our Money it seems they have counterfeited large Sums and [dispersed] their Emissaries to spread their counterfeit Dollars [through] the States. I have seen a thirty Dollar counterfeit Bill. It was badly executed. We ought to be, methinks, as industrious to defeat as they are to contrive. It is high Time to treat Tories with proper uniform Severity, & to watch Strangers and perhaps One another with a jealous Eye. The Enemies of our own House, are more dangerous than external Foes. But it is my Business to inform not to direct.  I hope the Genl. Assembly will attend, if they should not have already done it, to the Letter which I wrote them desiring the earliest Information after the Appointment of Delegates. Our State is not represented in Congress now, and will not be until I shall have received authentick Advice of my being chosen, or another Delegate shall have arrived. Therefore let me intreat that it may be done, that the new Delegates may come forward immediately. The Circumstances of my Family require that I shall return as soon as possible to make some suitable Provisions for it, and my long constant attention in Congress demands Relaxation.(4)  Our Loss at Danbury turns out to be less than we imagined, and We have killed more of the Enemy; but We have not certain account of either Every Thing in the Jersey statu quo. I congratulate your Honour on the Arrival of the Field-Peices. We shall take the Field under greater Advantages this than the last Campaign. Heartily wishing that the Success of it may be at least proportioned to our superior Advantages, that we may give our Enemies such convincing Proof of  their Folly, lnjustice and Cruelty as may induce them to drop the Contest, and thus this be our last Campaign, I am with great Respect, Yr Honors most Abated. hble Servt.

  Dear Sir Philadelphia May 9. 1777 Yours of the 2d Instant came duely to hand.(1) The Indifference of the People about recruiting the Army, is a Circumstance which ought to make Us consider what are the Causes of it. It is not merely the Melancholly arising from the unfortunate Event of the last Campaign, but the Small Pox, and above all the unhappy State of our Finances, which occasion this Evil. There are other Circumstances which are little attended to which contribute much more than is imagined to this unfavourable Temper in the People. The Prevalance of Dissipation, Debauchery, Gaming, Prophaneness and Blasphemy terrifies the best People upon the Continent, from trusting their Sons and other Relations among so many dangerous snares and temptations. Multitudes of People, who would with chearfull Resignation Submit their Families to the Dangers of the sword, shudder at the Thought of exposing them to what appears to them the more destructive Effects of Vice and Impiety. These Ideas would be received by many with scorn. But there is not the less Solidity in them for that. It is Discipline alone that can Stem the Torrent. Chaplains are of great use, I believe, and I wish Mr Leonard might be in the Army, upon such Terms as would be agreeable to him, for there is no Man of whom I have a better opinion. But there is so much difficulty in accomplishing any Thing of the Kind, that I wish G. Washington would either appoint him, or recommend him to Congress.  The Utility of Medals has ever been impressed Strongly upon my Mind. Pride, Ambition and indeed what a Philosopher would call Vanity, is the Strongest Passion in human Nature, and next to Religion, the  MAY 9, 1777  most operative Motive to great Actions. Religion, or if the fine Gentlemen please, Superstition and Enthusiasm, is the greatest Incentive and wherever it has prevailed, has never failed to produce Heroism. If our N. Englandmen were alone, and could have their own way, a great deal of this would appear, But in their present Situation, I fear We have little to expect from this Principle, more than the Performance of the People in the Camp. We ought to avail our selves then of even the Vanity of Men. For my own Part I wish We would make a Beginning, by Striking a Medal, with a Platone firing at General Arnold, on Horseback, His Horse falling dead under him, and He deliberately disentangling his feet from the Stirrups and taking his Pistolls out of his Holsters, before his Retreat. On the Reverse, He should be mounted on a Fresh Horse, receiving another Discharge of Musquetry, with a Wound in the Neck of his Horse. This Picture alone, which as I am informed is true History, if Arnold did not unfortunately belong to Connecticutt, would be sufficient to make his Fortune for Life. I believe there have been few such Scenes in the world.  We have not Artists at present for such works, and many other Difficulties would attend an Attempt to introduce Medals.  Taxation is begun in N.E. The Mass. raises 100,000 this year. The Regulation of Prices and the Embargo are Measures of which I could never see the Justice or Policy.  The Intimation in your Letter that the Enemy lost in killed, wounded and Prisoners 600 Men, surprizes me much; because it exceeds by at least two Thirds the largest account that has come from any other authority. I wish our N. England Men would practice a little honest Policy for their own Interest and Honour, by transmitting to Congress and publishing in the Newspapers, true states of the Actions in which they are concerned.

We are alarmed here with frequent accounts of numerous Desertions from our Army. Is there no Remedy for this Evil. Howe is trying his Hand at Bribery.

They despair of the Effects of Force, and are now attempting Bribery and Insinuation which are more provoking than all their Cruelties. What Effect would these have in N. England?

  Gentlemen, Philada. May 9th, 1777. When we arrived here, it plainly appeared that great pains had been taken to injure the character of Major-General Schuyler.  No direct charge had been urged against him: a series of sly insinua- MAY 9, 1777  tions-that he was making an enormous fortune at the expense of the public; that he had converted the specie provided by Congress for the Canada service, to his own private purposes, and when he showed his feelings of some unworthy treatment, severe rebukes and animadversions on his expressions and his supposed want of respect to his superiors. Those were weapons, employed so successfully, as in the end produced some resolutions of Congress, paring away his authority to nothing. It took us some time to become acquainted with the new members, and to undeceive those who wished for conviction. We had in the mean time got a committee appointed to inquire into the General's conduct at large. That business went on heavily, and seemed to promise no conclusion; we, therefore, were under the necessity to take a more direct course. The General's account of the specie was, at his request, reexamined; and after it had been passed by the commissioners at the treasury board, who made a full report in his favour, which was received by Congress and ordered to be published. This report, a printed copy of which is herewith transmitted, had a powerful effect on many of the members, who heard it with the utmost pleasure and frankly acknowledged that they had been deceived.(1)  The way being thus prepared, the General presented a memorial to Congress, stating such of their resolutions as conveyed censure upon him, justifying himself in every particular. This, after some debate, produced a unanimous resolution of Congress, that the memorial was satisfactory, and that the Congress entertained the same favourable opinion of the General as they entertained before the passing those resolutions .(2)  A complete and honourable vindication of the General's character and conduct being implied in that resolution, and the infamous charge of embezzling the specie effectually done away by the report from the treasury, we shall give ourselves no trouble about the proposed inquiry, especially as Congress came into the appointment of the committee with the utmost reluctance, almost every member declaring that there was no accuser or charge against the General, and that the inquiry was therefore unnecessary. All impediments being now removed, we shall proceed to take the most speedy measures for reinstating the General in his command.  In the critical situation of our affairs, his services are loudly called for. We, therefore, conceived that this business ought first to be despatched. It unavoidably occasioned some delay in the other matters committed to our charge, but you may be assured that they shall be attended to with all the zeal and diligence of which we are capable.  In the mean time we remain, with the utmost regard, honourable gentlemen, Your most obedt. humble servants, Phil. Livingston,  Jas. Duane.  Reprinted from Journals of N.Y. Prov.

  Honorable Gentlemen, Philadelphia 9th May 1777  This letter is intended to be delivered you by John Paul Jones Esquire an active and brave Commander in our Navy, who has already performed Signal Services in Vessels of little force and in reward for his Zeal, we have directed him to go on board the Amphitrite a French Ship of 20 Guns that brought in a valuable Cargo of Stores from Monsr. Hortalez & Co and with her repair to France. He takes with him his Commission, some Officers and Men, so that we hope he will under that Sanction make Some good Prizes with the Amphitrite, but our design in Sending him is (with the approbation of Congress) that you may purchase One of those fine Frigates that Mr Deane writes us you can get, and invest him with the Command thereof soon as possible. We hope you may not delay this business one Moment, but purchase in Such port or place in Europe as it can be done with most convenience & dispatch a fine fast sailing Frigate or larger Ship. Direct Captain Jones where he must repair to, and he will take with him his Officers and men towards manning her. You will assign him Some good House or Agent to supply him with every thing necessary to get the Ship speedily and well equipped and Manned, Somebody that will bestir themselves vigourously in the business and never quit until it is Accomplished.  If you have any plan or Service to be performed in Europe by Such a Ship that you think will be more for the Interest or honor of these States than Sending her out directly, Captain Jones is instructed to Obey your Order, and to Save repetition let him lay before you the instructions we have given him and furnish you with a Copy thereof. You can then judge what will be necessary for you to direct him in; and whatever you do will be approved as it will undoubtedly tend to promote the publick Service of this Country.  You See by this Step how much dependance Congress place in your advices and you must make it a point not to disapoint Capt Jones's wishes and our expectations on this Occasion.

  Sir, Philadelphia May 9. 1777 On receipt of this letter you are to proceed to Portsmouth in New Hampshire where you will find the Amphitrite a French Ship of 20 Guns commanded by Monsr. N. Fautrel a Gentleman that has acquitted himself honorably of the charge he undertook, and we doubt not he will continue the Same good conduct for the remainder of the Voyage.  This Ship is to proceed from Portsmouth to Charles Town, South Carolina, to load with Rice &c, from thence She goes to France, and we have proposed that you Should go in her this Voyage taking your Commission and Appearing or Acting on Suitable Occasions as the Commander. We know not the number of men on board this Ship, but if Captain Fautrel accepts our propositions, you will examine the Ships force, both as to Guns and men and if the latter are insufficient you may recruit as many more to go with you as Shall be deemed Sufficient to enable you to take and man Such Prizes as may come in your way.(1) In this respect you will consult Mr Langdon to whom we Send Some Warrants to be filled up if you want Petty Officers. We think the Number of men Should be Sufficient to defend the Ship against any armed Merchantmen at the Same time it must be remembered that she is to carry a Cargo from Carolina, therefore too much room must not be taken up with Water Provisions &c. Mr Langdon is directed to put on board sufficient for you and your people, Capt Fautrel will do the same for his. This to prevent hesitation on that Subject and we desire you will give all the aid & assistance in your power to get this Ship away as expeditiously as possible. We have told Monsr. Fautrel that one Third of all Prizes taken by his Ship under Authority of your Commission Shall be appropriated to the use of his owners, himself, Officers and men, the other two Thirds to be divided between the United States, you and your Men agreeable to the Resolves of Congress, and this engagement must be strickly complied with, therefore if you Send any Prizes into any Ports of this Continent, Monsr. Fautrel and you must write the Agent to reserve One third for his use and to follow his orders respecting it. If you carry or Send prizes into France he will receive A Third, you and your people a third, and the other third you must Order to be remitted to the Honorable Benjamin Franklin & Other American Commissioners at the Court of Versailles, Paris for the use of the United States. You will readily see the propriety and Necessity of preserving a Strict harmony and friendship with Monsr. Fautrel, this we recommend you to do at all events, give him every advice and Assistance in your power, and particularly endeavour to procure him good dispatch from Portsmouth & Charles Town. The Continental Agents Livinus Clarkson & John Dorsius will load the MAY 9, 1777  Ship at the latter place, they will also render you any Service you may Stand in need of.  You will naturally suppose we do not remove you from the Ship you were so lately appointed to for the Sole purpose of making this voyage in the Amphitrite, we have other veiws and is only adopted as part of our plan which we expect will afford you an Opportunity of doing some Mischief to our Enemies and some good for yourself and the Country you have engaged to serve. We hope you may make many Prizes and thereby lodge Funds in Europe that will assist in executing the other part of our veiws. We are advised by our Commissioners at the Court of France that they can procure us some fine Frigates and as we have a desire to gratify you with the command of a fine Ship in firm dependance that you will make good use of her to serve and promote the Interest of America, we send you to France in the Alnphitrite for these two purposes, first, to avail of her Guns & men to make a Cruizing voyage to France, and then to Obtain One of the Frigates mentioned. When Amphitrite arrives in France you will dispose of your Officers & Men so that they may remain in Safety at the Port whilst you proceed for Paris with the enclosed letter which you must deliver yourself. The Commissioners will procure you A fine Ship and the Officers and Men you take with you will assist towards manning her. The Commissioners will inform you what Port to repair to for this Ship, and whom you are to apply to for Supplies of every kind. We expect you will exert yourself to the Utmost to get the Ship they may appoint for you equipped, manned and fit for Service with the utmost expedition. We desire the Commissioners if they have any particular service for you to perform in Europe to give you the needful instructions, and if any Such you receive it is your business to execute their orders to the best of your power. Such Services as they may point out being performed, or if they order none, you will then enquire of them and of our Commercial Agents Wm Lee & Thomas Morris Esqrs. at Nantes or Bourdeaux if it be Necessary for you to receive on board any Stores or supplies for this Continent, and take in Such as may be ready. We hope you may obtain a fine Ship well equipped in every particular and that you'll be able to get her Officered & Manned. These things done you will steer for America making it your constant Study to take or destroy as many of the enemies Ships as possible during the Voyage. If you receive any dispatches from the Commissioners at Paris or the Commercial Agents for this or any Committee of Congress you must be very carefull of them and always have them ready to be Sunk if too heavy A Ship should attack you.  You will get into the first safe Port in these States that you can, with the dispatches if any you have. All prizes are to be addressed and give us notice immediately of your Arrival and Send an officer to the Continental Agents here, and to such persons in Europe as the   Commissioners or Commercial Agents may recommend for that purpose. You remember that we ardently wish to have Strict discipline with good usage maintained in our Navy, that Prisoners are to be treated with humanity, that dilligence in making dispatch both in Port and at Sea, frugality in Expences and care of the Ship, her Stores & materials are absolutely necessary and if duely practiced cannot fail to recommend you to our Friendship and favour.

  Sir, Philadelphia May 9 1777 We had the pleasure to receive your favour of the 22d April some days Since but could not reply sooner as it took some time to have the several French letters and papers rendered into English that they might be laid before Congress to obtain their orders for the disposition of the several articles that compose the Amphitrites Cargo, and We are now authorized to direct that you comply with such orders as the Board of War may think proper to give respecting the Military Stores, intrenching Tools &c, and with the Orders of the Cloathier General respecting the Article of Cloathing &c appertaining to that department.(1) Thus the entire Cargo will be disposed off between those two Branches. It only remains that we direct what is to be done with the Ship. We observe by your letter of the 21 Ultimo that you had determined to load the Ship Mercury with Masts, Spars &c which is well, as we had not at that time Sufficient documents to know what was best to be done with her. Whatever Cargo you Send by that Ship address the Same to Messrs. Rodrique Hortalez & Co by Bill of loading and MAY 9, 1777  Invoice, freight as Per Contract, inclose the Invoice and bill of Loading in A letter directed to that house, and Send duplicates thereof inclosed to the Honorable Commissioners at the Court of France. Other Copies you will send to us. The letters for Monsr Hortalez & Co must be indorsed to be delivered to the following houses at which ever of the Ports the Ship happens first to arrive.  Messrs. Eyries & Le Coureur Merchts, at Havre de Grace Le Pellettier & Du Doyer Nantes David Gradis & Son Bourdeaux Heber de St Clement Rochford Le Conte Ancient Councellor to the Sovereign Council of Lisle de France Rochelle Le Baron Brest Dujat Ancient Secry of the Marine L'Orient Casinove Bayonne The more valuable you make the Cargo with Suitable articles the more agreeable to us and the more acceptable will it be on the other side.  With respect to the Amphitrite we want a More valuable remittance to be made by her, and therefore have wrote Captain Fautrell, that he must proceed from Portsmouth to Charles Town in South Carolina to load with Rice and Indico and we request your Assistance to procure him dispatch from Portsmouth. For this purpose youl please to advance him such money and procure him such Stores, provisions and necessarys, as he may need to get the Ship away, you will take his receipts for the amount of all you Supply him with expressing it to be for the Ships use. Let him Sign Several Copies and it may not be amiss to mention therein the Sterling amount at the Current Rate of Exchange to prevent disputes hereafter. One of these Receipts you will transmit to Messrs. Hortalez & Co by the Ship, and another by the Mercury if she remains after the Amphitrite, and the rest to us. We have formed a plan for making this Ships Guns of Some Service to us by opposing them to our enemies, for this purpose John Paul Jones Esqr a Captain in our Navy is directed to proceed to Portsmouth where he will call on you. We have proposed to Monsr. Fautrel that Captain Jones shall embarque with him on board the Amphitrite taking his Commission in order that the ship may thereby be Authorized to make prizes of British Ships during the remainder of her Voyage. We have proposed this to Mr. Fautrel and expect he will gladly embrace the offer. His number of men we do not know, but suppose they will not be sufficient, therefore we have wrote Captain Jones to examine the ship, her Guns &c and inlist on ship as many Petty Officers & men as he may think necessary to compleat this Ship for defence or to enable her to take any British Armed Trader.  MAY 10, 1777  In this business we beg you will assist all in your power. Herein you have twelve Blank Warrants for Petty Officers and you may fill them up with the names of Such Suitable persons as agree to go with Jones in the Several Stations wanted taking care that none but Suitable Men are engaged. Any Blanks that remain transmit them to the Honorable Benjamin Franklin, Silas Deane & Arthur Lee Esqrs American Commissioners at the Court of Versailles, committing the Packet to Captain Jones Care, with A Charge to Sink it if accident renders that precaution necessary.  It is possible Mr Fautrel may object to this Plan, for we dont See by the Agrement that he is bound to comply with it, and in that case you'l Send us back the Warrants and tell Captain Jones he must return to the command of the Ship he left, but this we don't expect will happen. On the Contrary we think Monsr. Fautrel will gladly fall in with our views & that Jones will go the Voyage. In this case you will supply him with Provisions for himself and Officers and Men during the Voyage, advance what money may be needful agreeable to resolves of Congress and transmit Accounts thereof to the Marine Committee with Captain Jones Receipts. You must charge that Committee with the advances made Captain Jones and his men on this Occassion. The advances made Monsr. Fautrel and the Captain of the Mercury must be Charged to the Secret Committee.  We doubt not your exertions to concur with our views and if any dificulties arise to remove them, and remain, Sir, Your Obedt Servants, Robt Morris Wm. Whipple  Richard Henry Lee Phil. Livingston P.S. Shou'd Capt Fautrell think the third of Prizes which we have offered him too small a share for the use of his Ship, You may agree to allow him half & let him & Capt Jones Sign in Writing to fix the bargain, but if he will accept a third you'l say nothing of the half.(2)  ""

  Philadelphia May 10. 1777 The Day before Yesterday, I took a Walk, with my Friend Whipple to Mrs. Wells's, the Sister of the famous Mrs. Wright, to see her Waxwork.(1) She has two Chambers filled with it. In one, the Parable of the Prodigal Son is represented. The Prodigal is prostrate on his Knees, MAY 10, 1777  before his Father whose Joy and Grief, and Compassion all appear in his Eyes and Face, struggling with each other. A servant Maid, at the Fathers command. is pulling down from a Closet Shelf, the choicest Robes, to cloath the Prodigal, who is all in Rags. At an outward Door, In a Corner of the Room stands the elder Brother, chagrined at this Festivity, a Servant coaxing him to come in. A large Number of Guests are placed round the Room. In another Chamber, are the Figures of Chatham, Franklin, Sawbridge, Mrs. Maccaulay, and several others. At a Corner is a Miser, sitting at his Table, weighing his Gold, his Bag upon one Side of the Table, and a Thief behind him, endeavouring to pilfer the Bag.  There is Genius, as well as Taste and Art, discovered in this Exhibition: But I must confess, the whole Scaene was disagreable to me. The Imitation of Life was too faint, and I seemed to be walking among a Group of Corps's, standing, sitting, and walking, laughing, singing, crying, and weeping. This Art I think will make but little Progress in the World.  Another Historical Piece I forgot, which is Elisha, restoring to Life the Shunamite's Son. The Joy of the Mother, upon Discerning the first Symptoms of Life in the Child, is pretty strongly expressed.  Dr. Chevots Waxwork, in which all the various Parts of the human Body are represented, for the Benefit of young Students in Anatomy and of which I gave you a particular Description, a Year or two ago, were much more pleasing to me. Wax is much fitter to represent dead Bodies, than living ones.(2)  Upon a Hint, from one of our Commissioners abroad, We are looking about for American Curiosities, to send across the Atlantic as presents to the Ladies.(3) Mr. Rittenhouse's Planetarium, Mr. Arnolds Collection of Rareties in the Virtuoso Way, which I once saw at Norwalk in Connecticutt, Narragansett Pacing Mares, Mooses, Wood ducks, Flying Squirrels, Redwinged Black birds, Cramberries, and Rattlesnakes have all been thought of.  Is not this a pretty Employment for great Statesmen, as We think ourselves to be? Frivolous as it seems, it may be of some Consequence. Little Attentions have great Influence. I think, however, We ought to consult the Ladies upon this Point. Pray what is your Opinion? (4)  ""

  Philadelphia May 10. 1777 Yours of the 7th was brought me this Morning.(1) My Meaning was that if the Conduct of our Army had depended on me, I should have taken more Pains to have obtained exact Information of the Enemies Numbers, and our own, and should have considered every Inclination of the Enemies Intentions of coming to Philadelphia more particularly. Altho there is no doubt that Congress have authority to direct the military operations, yet I think they would be unwise to attempt it. This must be left to the General officers.  We have not the Information that you have respecting our own Force. There is not a Man in Congress who knows what Force you now have in N. Jersey. We have had no Returns a long time and the opinions of Gentn who come from Camp are very various. My Constituents have a Right to expect that I give my Council whenever it may be usefull; and my Constituents shall not be disappointed. If you knew how many dozens of my opinions are rejected where one is adopted, you would not think they had much Weight. But enough of this.  My opinion last Summer was very consistent I believe, with that in my last Letter A Man may be humble before the Enemy, and proud before a Friend. Some who think too little of their Powers and Forces against the Enemy, think too highly of their own Importance, among their Friends, and treat the latter with less Delicacy than they would the former. For my own Part I care not how haughty Men are, to the Enemies of their Country, provided they have Regard to Truth & Justice, nor how humble they are among its Friends.  If by the finer Feelings of the Gentlemen of the Army, are meant their Moral Feelings, no Man detests more than myself, the Idea of hurting them. But if Vanity, and Pleasure is meant, I think, no Harm would be done by mortifying it. I am much mistaken and much misinformed, if the nice Feelings, the Pride, the Vanity, the Foppery, the Knavery and Gambling among too many of the officers, do not end in direct Endeavours to set up a Tyrant sooner or later, unless early Endeavours are used to controul them. I dont mean by this, any General Reflections upon the officers, most of whom I believe MAY 10, 1777  to be good Citizens at present. but by the Representations We hear there are so many of an opposite Character, that there is danger that the Contagion will Spread.  The Necessity of establishing an Army, Superiour to all our Enemies, is obvious, and, for my own Part, I dont See any Thing in the Power of Congress to do, to accomplish this great Purpose, but what has been done. If you think of any Thing more that is proper to be done, I should thank you for the Hint. I have Reason to believe upon very good Authority, that foreign Troops might be hired, both Germans, Swiss and French. What think you of the Policy of hiring them? The Waste of the Natives of the Country, in the Army, is a melancholly, and an alarming Consideration. We want People, for Agriculture, Manufactures, Commerce and war, both by Sea and Land.  ""

  Dr. Papa, Saturday 10th May 1777. The 2 inclosed Evening posts of the 6th & 8th instant with Bradfords last Wednesday's paper, which I suppose was forwarded as usual per post, will inform you pretty nearly of all the news Our loss at Danbury was considerable. By G. Washington's letter to Congress we have lossed 1700 barrels of Pork, 50 of beef, 1000 tents and several other articles of less value as rum, rice, wheat, oats, flour &c the particulars of which I dont remember. The enemy make our loss much more considerable, but I believe they have exaggerated it a good deal. If we can get money, and support the credit of what is now in circulation, I am in hopes the enemy will not be able to make any considerable progress this campaign unless their reinforcements from Europe should be as great as they give out, and unless they arrive sooner than they arrived last year.  There remain great abuses in every department to be corrected: committees are nominated to inspect the Commissaries depart., measures are taken to prevent the shameful practices of officers defrauding their soldiers of their pay, thereby occasioning their desertion to the enemy & great discontents at camp.  The enemy by the latest advices from Camp remain quiet. Carleton is not yet come to Ticonderoga, nor have we any intelligence of his being on the way. G. Schuyler recd. yesterday letters from fort Stanwix informing him that the 6 nations & their allies would observe a perfect neutrality-this is a great point gained.  From all the information I can gather, and I have the opportunity MAY 10, 1777  of getting the best, the French nation is much disposed in our favor, so is the court, but prudential & cautious maxims of policy will prevent for some time, I think, their openly engaging in the w ar. We have already received very essential services from that People. Were our people more united & more spirited we should soon put an end to the war.  G. Schuyler has got the model of the flaxmill made for me; but it is at Saratoga, & God knows when & how I shall get it from thence.  I was yesterday reappointed one of the board of war, and consequently shall have my hands full.(1)  Do let me know whether the grapes & fruit have been much damaged by the frost.  A resolve has passed giving the enemy's vessels & cargoes to the crews who shall bring them into our ports. We perceive the enemy by a similar practice encourage our sailors to be guilty of highest perfidy & breach of trust, we must counteract them with their own arts. Several of our vessels from the perfidiousness of the crews, consisting chiefly of English sailors, have been carried into the enemys ports. The Aurora a valuable Tobacco ship, was by this means carried into Liverpool.  I hope your intended jaunt will be agreeable, but I would not have you set out unless the weather becomes more settled.

  Sir, Philada. May 10th. 1777.  I have Nothing further in Charge from Congress at this Time, except the enclosed Resolve, founded upon Complaints which, if not immediately enquired into and redressed, must be productive of the most fatal Consequences to the Army.  Nothing can so effectually lay the Foundation of Discontent, and of Course encourage a Spirit of Mutiny and Desertion among the Soldiers, as withholding their Pay from them; and to this Cause, there is too much Reason to apprehend, we must attribute the many Instances of Desertion of which we have daily Accounts.  The Congress therefore have taken the Matter into Consideration; and with a View of doing Justice to the injured Soldier, and exposing the Officer who neglects or designedly withholds his Pay, and to prevent the evil Effects of such Conduct on the public Cause, have recommended it to you to institute a Court of Enquiry to examine into the Behaviour of the Officers in this particular, and to see that their Men are regularly and honestly paid.(1) I beg Leave to refer your Attention to the Resolve,(2) and am, with Sentiments of the greatest Esteem, Sir, your most obed. & very hble Servt.

  Philadelphia May 10th 1777 I heared with great pleasure that my dear children were safely arrived in France.(1) Before this intelligence reached me I had suffered much from apprehensions both for them and their worthy Uncles, in a Country (England) where every consideration of virtue and justice, is sacrificed to wicked resentment and views of Tyranny. The risk and danger of correspondence to Great Britain prevented me from writing to you whilst you remained in that Country, and not a want of affection, for whilst you continue to behave as well as you have done, my tenderest affection shall always be placed on you. The views I formerly entertained for my eldest Son must now be changed, with the great alterations that have taken place in the System of North America. Instead of the Church I would now have him as knowing as possible in Commerce, as well the Theory as the Practical part. For this purpose, if his good Uncle William should reside in France, my Son will be employed by him as Clerk or Agent in some capacity, by which a temporary support may be gained, and a lasting knowledge of business at the same time. But, whether he is under the immediate care of his Uncle, or any other Gentleman in France, I hope and insist that he pay the closest attention to business, and the greatest respect and obedience to him under whose care and patronage he lives. Every present and future good consequence will flow from such a conduct, and every evil from the contrary. Let my dear Son therefore, grave upon his mind, and faithfully practice this advice of his affectionate father. It will be of great importance to learn well the French language, and be able to speak, read, and write it with correctness and fluency. Our future commerce with France will be so extensive as to render this indispensible, and I desire it may not be neglected. If Gentlemen in France observe your attention to business and capacity for the discharge of it, there is no doubt but on your return to your own Country, you MAY 10, 1777  will be so trusted to conduct the business of foreign Merchants, as to be very useful to them, and profitable to yourself.

One of them is from Mr Deane who not only mentions him as a Gentn of Rank, good Family & Fortune but also as a Man of great Merit desiring my particular attention to him & that I shou'd supply him with Money which will be repaid in France by a Gentn to whom America is under the most important obligations. You will therefore excuse & oblige me at the same time by your favourable attention to Monsr. Armand for he chooses to pass by that Name & shoud he want money I will pay his drafts for what he Stands in need of. I find he is a little disgusted at an appointment made for him by Congress this day and I believe it was through the inattention of a Committee which I shall get set right again in a Short time.1 I am Dr sir with the greatest esteem & affection, Your obedt hble sert.

  My Dear Sir, Philadelphia 10th May 1777. Your two favors of 21st and 22d were handed me the 3d inst by Mr. Champney. The arrival of the Amphitrite gives me double pleasure as she has been long expected and I had in my own mind given her over for lost. This ship has been so long from France that no intelligence can be expected from her. A packet is daily expected with dispatches from that country. A ship with a similar cargo to the Amphitrite is arrived at Martinico after unsuccessfully attempting to get into some of our ports. However we are now well furnished with materials to carry on the war, men only are wanting to use those materials It grieves me that New Hampshire's quota should be so backward, though perhaps not more so than some other states, but it would be my pride to hear that her sons were first in the field. I think you did right in delivering arms and clothing to the troops. The clothing General tells me he has given orders for clothing all the troops. When I urged your sending your accounts quarterly I did not mean the accounts of those ships that were building; that I know is impossible. What I had in view was the prizes and those ships fitted out by order of the Secret Committee. I have applied to the Clerks of the Committees for accounts of the money sent you which I shall forward so soon as obtained.  MAY 10, 1777  I have urged the appointment of the officers for Roche's Ship and was in hopes of having it done so as to send the Commissions by this conveyance, but now despair of getting it done so soon. Roche's character is to be inquired into. I was not here when the orders were given for building that vessel but am told the orders were to rig her a brig and that she was to mount no more than 18 guns, but have lately been informed she is built for a ship and pierced for 20 Guns. I do not imagine that rigging her a ship will be very exceptionable but mounting 20 guns on her certainly will-as that alters her rate.(1)  A Navy Board is to be established at Boston.(2) The gentlemen who compose it are elected. You were in nomination, but as I thought you had rather continue in the business you are than to remove to Boston for a salary of 1500 dollars I did not urge your appointment. The gentlemen are Mr. Warren of Massachusetts, Mr. Varnum of Rhode Island and Mr. Deshon of Connecticut-to them I expect the case of Capt Roche will be referred.  Col Thornton set out the 3d inst. I enclose you his receipt for 65 dollars and told him his draft was refused payment which he promises to have settled without giving you any trouble in the matter.  I am now a single representative of the State of New Hampshire and an arduous task I have of it by advice from Col Bartlett. I suppose Mr Frost is on his way here. I heartily wish he was arrived, and hope some other gentleman will soon be dispatched after him. I shall set out soon after Mr Frost's arrival. I find my health absolutely requires exercise and relaxation. I have not had time to mount my horse since I arrived here from Baltimore nor more than twice while there. Such a life may suit some constitutions but will soon ruin mine.  Enclosed you have an order on the Loan Office for 40,000 dollars for account of Marine Committee. You will also receive from the Secret Committee an order on a gentleman at Boston for 17500, these sums I hope will serve you for the present.  You will receive directions from the Committee respecting the Amphitrite. She is to go to South Carolina. Inter nos I have not a very high opinion of the plan of sending Capt Jones in her, however if it succeeds I shall be very agreeably disappointed.(3) You no doubt will do your endeavour to assist in procuring men &c.  Our army is daily increasing and I hope will soon be in a condition to attack the enemy and either destroy or drive them from their posts. Thelr Ships are still very troublesome on this coast, though some vessels do escape them. I hope the Dove and Friend's adventure will be of the fortunate number, I have not yet heard of the sailing of the Morris, Gunnison from Virginia, but think she must be gone before this. I hope to send you the commissions in a few days---in the interim am sincerely yours, Wm Whipple  ""

  Sir Philadelphia May 11th 1777 A few days ago I received a letter from General Nash, announcing the death of General Moore; at the same time I received some letters recommending Col. Clark for promotion in his room. But altho. I have a very high opinion of Col. Clark as an active, vigilant, and gallant Officer, I can not be satisfied that it is right for me to make a nomination so far out of the usual line, unless I have first your Excellency's assurance that it will be satisfactory to my country. Therefore I have resolved to consult you thereupon, and suspend all proceedings relative thereto, until I shall be favored with your answer. I will beg leave also to suggest to you, that nothing but the command of my country shall make me nominate any man whose merit as a soldier is even suspected, altho he should stand first in order; and I believe our State is too jealous of her honor, and too zealous in the common cause, to give me any such command. Truly, Sir, our affairs have suffered very much through the insufficiency of our Officers, and I am one, among many in Congress, who are determined, so long as I have the honor of a seat, to keep a very strict watch over them. It shall not be my fault, if worthless drones consume the public treasure. It is but justice to say that we have sorme excellent officers, and our Commander in Chief is very justly admired by all the world.(1)  Nothing interesting has happened since my last, except the arrival of a French ship with military stores, which are exceedingly seasonable and important In short we now only want men; and one vigorous campaign would give our affairs a very flourishing aspect. Our liberty would be established beyond all danger.  We have had no debates of any consequence in Congress except on the Confederation; all those I shall transmit you at once. It goes on very slowly, and I fear, the difficulty of preserving the independence of the States, and at the same time giving to each its proper weight in the public councils, will frustrate a Confederation altogether.(2)  I have had so short a notice of this opportunity that I can not be full on this subject: but as I give the most diligent attention to it, nothing material will escape me, and you shall be fully informed.

  My dear Sir Philad May 12 1777 Amidst your Hurry of Business and my own, I cannot help withdrawing myself for a Moment to throw on paper a single Sentiment for your Consideration. Europe and America seem to be applauding our Imitation of the Fabian Method of carrying on this War without considering as I conceive the widely different Circumstances of the Carthaginian & the British Generals. It will recur to your Memory that the Faction of Hanno in Carthage prevented Hannibals receiving the Supplys from them which he had a Right to expect and his Necessities requird. This left him to the Resources of his own Mind, and obligd him to depend upon such Supplys as he could procure from the Italians. Under such a Circumstance, it was the Wisdom of Fabius to put himself in the State of Defence but by no means of Inactivity-by keeping a watchful Eye upon Hannibal and cutting of his forraging & other Parties by frequent Skirmishes he had the strongest Reason to promise himself the Ruin of his Army without any Necessity of risqueing his own by a general Engagement. But General Howe (whom by the way I am not about to compare to Hannibal as a Soldier) has at all times the best Assurances of Supplies from Britain. There is no Faction there to disappoint him and the British Navy is powerful enough to protect Transports & provision Vessels coming to him. Hannibal despaird of Reinforcements from Carthage, but Howe has the fullest Assurances of early reinforcements from Britain & cannot fail of receiving them, unless a general War has taken place which I think is at least problematical. They are expected every Day. Would Fabius, if he were his  MAY 12, 1777  Enemy, pursue the Method he took with the Carthaginian General? Would he not rather attend to the present Circumstances, and by destroying the Army in Brunswick prevent as much as possible the Enemy increasing in Strength even if reinforcements should arrive or puting a total End to the Campaign if they should not. I am sensible our own Circumstances have been such, thro' the Winter past, as to make it impracticable to attempt any thing, but I hope we are or shall be very soon in a Condition to take a decisive part, and I do not entertain any Doubt but we shall see such an enterprizing Spirit as will confound our Enemies and give Assurances to the Friends of Liberty & Mankind that we still retain a just Sense of our own Dignity and the Dignity of our Cause and are resolvd by Gods Assistance to support it at all Hazzards. I am &c  ""

  Dr. Papa, P.M. 12th May 1777. The ship Seine which arrived at Martinico with military Stores for the united States in sailing from Martinico for Boston was taken by a English frigate the morning after she left Martinico: A considerable part of her cargo was landed, at Martinico, part of which is just arrived in a sloop which has got in to Sinapuxent inlet-consists principally of muskets.  The Govr. of Martinico Count D'Argou in concert with the continental agent at that place had concerted a wise scheme to prevent the Seine's falling into the enemy's hands. He wrote a letter to the Govr. of Miquelon artfully calculated to conceal the real destination of the vessel pretending she was destined to the Isle of Miquelon with military stores. The Capt. thro' his letters overboard, but the Pilot kept some papers which discovered the real voyage vizt. to Boston. However Count D'Argou has sent a spirited memorial to the Governor of Dominica demanding the restitution of the vessel as the French King's property. This matter may possibly afford a pretence to the French of declaring war agt. [Englan]d, if they should be thus inclined, tho' I think it there interest and ours too to remain quiet some time longer: they can, & have afforded us material assistance, and I have no doubt of the intention of that court to give us still further assistance.  We have no news from Camp: we had letters from Gen. Washington dated the 10th Morris; (1) and encampt. is marked out, it is said, at Bound Brook for ten thousand men. So we conjecture G. Washington intends moving to that place, which is but 5 miles distant from Brunswick. Col. Conway (mentioned in my letter to Molly)(2) informs me the MAY 12, 1777  French have 60 ships of the line (mostly 74) ready for sea: he says the ships are all new, or mostly new, & that a great reform has taken place in the French service. I think we have a valuable acquisition in Col. Conway. He speaks English well. I am, yr. affectionate Son,  Ch. Carroll of Carrollton ""

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia 13th May 1777 The inclosed infamous Act of Parliament is taken from the New York Gazette and its authenticity therefore not to be doubted.(1) The question upon this is, whether every State will not pass acts appointing places of security where the prisoners they take may be safely kept as pledges for the good usage of our people, or as objects of punishment in the way of retaliation? In proportion as our enemies loose the hopes of subduing us by open force, they endeavor more strenuously to sap us by corrupt influence and by the wicked machinations of their Tory friends. To put an effectual stop to the proceedings of the latter, will it not be necessary so to provide by law, as that every Tory may be precisely in the same situation if we succeed in this war, that we undoubtedly shall be if the enemy prevail. And what this latter will be, the inclosed Act of Parliament very plainly declares. The point is, how to distinguish previously the Whigs from the Tories. I believe, by a strict Test, and by appointing a General and a County board of Commissioners, with small but compitent funds to carry on quick correspondence with each other, and to search into the conduct of suspicious Residents, and of all unknown Passengers or Travellers. As you may rely upon it, that Tory machinations are now more wicked than ever, and their correspondence with each other, and their injurious communications not to be doubted. I wish some of the most sensible Whigs in our Assembly would take under consideration what I have here suggested the propriety of. The necessity of completing our Batallions is so obvious, that I suppose the Assembly will adopt the plan of drafting recommended by Congress,(2) and if they do, will it not be highly proper to have discreet recruiting Officers at every place where the Militia is assembled for the draft, who by clearly pointing out to the young Men the advantages of bounty, annual clothes, and land for those that voluntarilv engage, may procure a sufficiency on the willing plan. Nor is it a bad argument with them to shew how safely and  MAY 13, 1777  easily they are carried thro the Small pox at the public expence, by the present plan of inoculation. Above all things my dear Sir, let us secure the credit of our money by a vigorous Taxation. Maryland has done so, and so have the Eastern States, and all must do it to procure public confidence in our funds and the stability of our currency.  Our Army is approaching the enemies lines and promises soon to be active. We have no late intelligence from France, tho we have reason every day to expect it. Capt Weks in the Continental Ship Reprisal of 16 guns & 100 & odd men has taken & sent into Port L'Orient a Lisbon packet of equal force to himself, with three Ships that were under her Convoy, and the provisions we have taken at Sea, more than compensate for the Danbury loss, since the latter was only 1700 barrels of Meat with some flour & grain, and we have brought in 5000 barrels of Meat bound to N. York.  Colo. Nelson is gone home ill, so that we three are here fixed to hard service. We deserve compassion and relief. I have no objection to a service however irksome, if it is so contrived that a reasonable relief may now and then be interposed, so as to ease the Individual, without injury to the public.  We learn lately, that the account of General Carletons approach to Ticonderoga was premature, and in the mean time a considerable reenforcement has arrived from the Eastward, so that we are no longer in pain for that Post.

  Honored Sir Philadelphia May 14th. 1777 Your letter to Congress was received and read, and then committed to the Board of War.(1) I am Sorry to hear that the Militia are no better Armed in this time of danger. I believe there are no Continental Arms to Spare at present, more are daily expected. If any are due to the State of Connecticut, it would be best to Send a particular account of the Number and request Congress that they be replaced as Soon as any Shall arrive. Congress has lately been employed in regulating the Several departments of the Army that the business may be properly MAY 14, 1777  conducted and frauds and abuse prevented. The Articles of Confederation have Several times come Under consideration but not much progress made therein. Rhode Island is not represented. Mr Ellery's time expired last week & he has no information of being reappointed. Letters as late as the 15th of April received from our Agent in Martineco Inform that our Trade receives all the protection that could be desired from the Govt of the French Islands, but no certain accounts whether a war will Soon take place between France & Britain.  Your Honr has probably Seen the late Act of Parliament for Sending the Americans to England & detaining them in prison without Bail or mainprize till the first of Jany. 1778. The best way to relieve our people who may fall into their hands, is by a vigorous exertion to get as many of theirs as possible into our custody, as nothing but the fear of retaliation will induce them to regard the laws of humanity.  The Gentleman who gave information of Governor Franklin's misbehaviour and the inattention of our Government to prevent it seemed displeased that any part of the information was contradicted by your Honrs letter.(2) I have no doubt but his information was good as to Govr Franklin's Misconduct. As to our Government being informed of it he says that he told Genll Parsons of it and Mr Burr of Fairfield was also informed of it. Mr Duer is Zealously engaged to Suppress Tories.(3)  The Congress promoted Colonels Huntington and Read to the rank of Brigadiers General on the 12th instant, the first on General Washington's request.(4) I wish for leave to return home for a Short time at least, but it wont do to leave the State of Connecticut unrepresented.

I am suffering every day for Want of my farm to ramble in. I have been now for near Ten Weeks in a drooping disagreable Way, loaded constantly with a Cold. In the Midst of infinite Noise, Hurry, and Bustle, I lead a lonely melancholly Life, mourning the Loss of all the Charms of Life, which are my family, and all the Amusement that I ever had in Life which is my farm.  If the warm Weather, which is now coming on, should not cure my Cold, and make me better I must come home. If it should and I should get tolerably comfortable, I shall stay, and reconcile my self to the Misery I here suffer as well as I can.

  Dr. Papa, Phila. 14th [i.e. 16th] May l777 (1) Inclosed you have the Pena. evening posts of Tuesday & Thursday. We this day received intelligence of a vessel arrived at Egg harbour with Cloths & between 3 & 4 thousand stand of arms from France. This vessel has brought English prints as late as the latter end of February & letters from our Commissioners in France dated sometime in March & one from Docr. Lee dated 23d March from Burgos in Spain.(2) The news brought by these dispatches are favourable. The King of Portugal is dead, & troops were filing off from the frontiers of Spain towards Portugal. Capt Weeks had brought into Port l'Orient 5 prises, among which was the Falmouth packet bound from that port to Lisbon. These vessels Weeks disposed of tho' not without difficulty at Port l'Orient. From the affected orders given him to depart, & the excuses made by him for delaying his departure at and last admitted with great seeming reluctance, it is plain, the French court wants to temporise & to gain time. The vessel which carried the dispatches from Congress to France of our Successes in the Jersies was just arrived at Nantes: no doubt the good news would encourage the French court to continue their assistance. To judge from Dor. Lee's letter Spain also is well inclined. By a letter from London of the 14th March to that gentleman the Ministry have altered their intended plan of operations. Owing to the difficulty of raising foreign mercenaries, they have determined to order the greatest part of their forces to fall down the St. Laurence & join Howe. If so, no attack will be made on Tionderoga this year This piece of news corresponds with intelligence lately brought by some Indians from Canada, of which I advised you in my last. G. Arnold is in town. He says two officers who have lately come out of N. York & were well acquainted with some English officers were informed by them that their loss in their expedition to Danbury amounted in killed, wounded & prisoners & missing to 500, if so they have paid dear for the destruction of our magazine at that place.  All is yet quiet in the Jersies. I believe the enemy will attempt nothing of importance till they receive reinforcements. Gen. Washington disapproves of the inlisting servants & convicts in his letter of the 13 instant.(3) MAY 16, 1777  Tell Molly they ask for making shoes 45/pair, tea £45.15. per pound. I can not give such prices, and I am sure she will commend me for it.  An English newspaper of some day in March (I forget the date) mentions the enemy's losses in the Jersies. The ministry allow our Generals outgeneraled theirs. However they stile it only a military check. My love to Molly & Mrs. Darnall. I am, yr. affectionate Son,  Ch. Carroll of Carrollton ""

The Board took it into consideration this morning, but did not think it necessary to make any report to Congress on the contents as the resolution of Congress passed last December authorizing Your Honr to retain two Regiments for the defence of the State until further order has not been superceded.(1) Capt John Langdon has Informed the board of war that he had Sent about 3000 Arms to Connecticut to furnish the continental raised in that State. All the residue of the arms that were in the hands of the Agents in the Eastern States are ordered to be Sent to Springfield where a Laboratory is ordered to be erected, and the Board have agreed upon Sending an order to the Store keeper there to furnish as MAY 16, 1777  many more as are necessary for equipping the Troops in Connecticut upon proper muster rolls being produced to him. Letters were this Day received from France as late as the 25th of March but no material news, they related chiefly to commerce. London papers were received mentioning the Battles of Trenton and Princetown last winter, which were humiliating to the Ministry. They applaud the Conduct of our Generals. An extract of a letter from London mentions that the Enemies forces are to be removed from Canada to Joyn General Howe's Army, but we ought not to give so much Credit to it as to alter our plans for defence in the Northern department.

I Should think it advisable to represent to General Washington the necessity of having the Battalions Stationed in Connecticut.

Roche is possessed of as I am an entire Stranger to the Nature & intent of your Voy[age] except the particulars you have been pleased to inform me of.(1) I hope however that the Ship may have got Safe into Carolina where the Cargo will find ready Sale but not on such advantageous terms as in Virga. or here. The Approach to these Coasts however is infinitely more dangerous at this Time as the Ennemies Ships are numerous & vigilant in their endeavours to destroy our Trade. We must therefore agree Carolina was the best Destination the Ship could have had at this period & I hope a good Voyage will result to all parties concerned. I take the Liberty to inclose a few Lines to Mr. John Dorsius (2) who transacts the Business of my House in Chas. Town. In him you will find an honest Worthy Man well versed in Business ready to give you his advice or assistance if wanted. I find many Persons are going from these States towards Carolina to purchase Goods on Speculation so that you will not want customers for your MAY 20,1777  Cargo but it might probably be no bad part of your plan to sell in Carolina sufficient to load the Ship Union in Carolina with Rice & after dispatching her therewith & another Vessell if you chuse it for if your Cargo is of the Value I am informed it is you will have Funds Sufficient to Ship many Cargoes of produce. You might then travell towards Virga. with the remainder of the Cargo. It will sell well there & the Investment may then be made in Tobo. You can readily get information in Carolina of the best Way of removing your Goods to Virginia. This plan I only mention as it may probably promote the Interest of this Concern but Captn. Roche & you must finally determine for altho it is probable that I am interested Yet I know not to what extent on what terms nor am vested with any authority to advise or direct what should be done. I observe in your Instructions you are to attempt a division of the risque by exchanging Risques with other Merchts. but this you must confine to Carolina where you are because People this way can not know the Circumstances of your Expeditions in time to make such Agreements. However there is an Insurance Office in Carolina & perhaps it may be more eligible to make Insurance on part of the Cargoes sent from thence to France I would order this to be done on a certain proportion of my Concern if I knew what it is. I advise you by all means to expedite the Union & send her away soon as you can because it is probable the British Cruizers may draw that way before long & watch that Port as closely as they have done others. I think you had best Ship Rice, Tobacco, Skins & Furrs if reasonable but no Indigo for that article is too dear & must continue so whilst it is necessary to Ship it in Small Vessells for the Sake of making remittances be the cost what it may. If you come towards Virginia I can & will be usefull to your operations in that country but in Carolina you are too distant for that Speedy Communication that coud make me usefull.

May 20th. 1777 I have your letters of the 13th & 16th Inst. and from their Contents I am to suppose you have set out on your journey, however I direct this MAY 20, 1777  to you at Baltimore & if you are gone I depend that those who Act for you will send it after you to the care of Benjn. Harrison Junr Esqr. I sent your letters to General Washington & the pay Master General the day after they came to my hands. I am satisfyed with your Shipping the flour on our joint Account & will receive the Net proceeds of what you have ordered to be sold to be applyed in payment of such bills as you may draw on me for your own Account to the extent of One Thousand pounds. I shall honor your drafts on me to the Extent of Two thousand five hundred pounds on any Account, however I now mean to alter these arrangements provided what I shall now propose be agreed to by Carter Braxton Esqr. in Virginia. It seems he has also determined on sending to Carolina to purchase Goods and invites me to be Concerned. I will therefore send this letter enclosed to him and propose that he shou'd join us & let this Speculation be in thirds. If he agrees to this you may extend the purchase to Twelve or fifteen thousand Pounds this Cury provided the Goods can be obtained on reasonable terms, and you must hurry them back soon as possible for I believe so many People will go on this plan as to raise prices in Carolina & fall them on their return this way. If this is agreed to Mr Braxton must supply you with some money to carry with you. I think five thousand pounds which I believe he can readily do & the letters herewith will enable you to procure the Remainder for drafts on me or on him but unless you can buy the Goods cheap & bring them safe I think you had best not go so deep. I shall desire Mr Braxton to meet you at Williamsburg & for that purpose I alter my first design & enclose this letter open to him instead of sending it to Baltimore. Draw your bills at as long sight as you can & advise me regularly of your proceedings. I am, Sir, Your hble servant, Robt Morris  ""

  Sir, Philadelphia May 20th 1777 We are favored with yours covering a resolve of Assembly to which we shall pay due attention. The first Volume of the last edition of the Journal of Congress, is now published, and shall be forwarded to Williamsburg by the first opportunity.(1) This Volume reaches no MAY 20, 1777  further than the 30th of December 1775. As our duty directs, so our inclinations lead to an immediate compliance with the desires of the House of Delegates, but we apprehend insurmountable difficulty in getting the manuscript journal, because the many secret articles cannot be exposed to a Copier, and neither the Secretary or ourselves have time to do it. The Printer has hitherto been delayed for want of paper, but now that is obtained, we shall urge the publication of the remaining Journal, and send it to you Sir, with all the dispatch in our power.

  May 21. 1777 Dont be two much alarmed at the Report of an Attack of Boston. The British Court are pursuing a system which in the End I think they will find impolitick. They are alarming the Fears of the People, every where. Wentworths Letter was contrived to terrify Portsmouth.(1) Other Threats are given out against Boston. Others against the Eastern shore of Virginia and Maryland. Now Philadelphia is to be invaded-then Albany. Sometimes New London, at others N. Haven.  After all they will make but a poor Figure this Summer. There is some Reason to think, they have sent to Canada, for the Troops there by Water. Their Reinforcement from Europe, I think will not be great. Our Army is grown pretty strong. Pray let my dear Countrymen turn out, and not let a Man be wanting of their Quota.  The Enemy will find it impollitick to awaken the Apprehensions of so many People. Because when the Peoples Fears subside which most of them will, they will be succeeded by Contempt  MAY 21, 1777  My Eyes are weak again, and I am in bad Health but I keep about.

  Sir Philadelphia May 21st. 1777 Mr. Gorham and Mr. Russel, Agents of the Town of Charlestown, have presented to Congress a Petition from the unfortunate Inhabitants of that Place, praying for a Compensation for their Losses.(1) The Petition was drawn in very decent & handsome Terms, containing a lively Description of the Distresses to which the unhappy Petitioners are reduced from a State of Ease & Affluence; and the Gentlemen who presented the Petition have urged every Motive which could either show the Justice & Policy of granting the Request, or which could move the Humanity & Charity of those who heard it.  These Endeavors of theirs have been seconded by your Delegates in Congress, but to no other Effect than to obtain a Committee to consider the Petition; whose Report, altho' it expresses much Sympathy with that virtuous People in Affliction, contains a Denyal of their Request, on Account of the present Condition of the Finances of the United States: As the granting of Compensation, even in Part, at this Time, would set a Precedent for so many & so great Demands of a similar Nature that the public Treasury would not be able to spare so much from the necessary Calls of the War.  There was a great Deal of Delicacy shown thro the whole Debate upon this Subject. Every one wished it was in the Power of Congress  MAY 21, 1777  to grant the desired Relief; most acknowledged the Justice of the Demand; but all agreed that, at present, it would be impolitic to grant it, except the Delegates from the Massachusetts Bay.  Upon a Motion that a small Part of the Losses should be made up, such was the Reluctance to giving a Negative that the previous Question was moved & put; so that a present Determination might not prejudice the Petitioners in any future Application.  It may be doubtful whether such Petitions to Congress from particular Corporations, or Individuals in any State, are proper. Perhaps it would be better that each State shd. ascertain the Amount of its own Losses, in this Kind, and represent it to Congress; that so, in the End, some Adjustment may be made, between the several States.  That such an Adjustment will, sooner or later, be made is not doubted by Us, because, neither Equity nor sound Policy will admit that different States, contending in the same common Cause, having in View the same common Benefit, should be unequally loaded with Expence, or suffer disproportionate Losses. But as it is impossible to foresee what Course the War will take, or what State will be the greatest Sufferer, it is probable this Question will be postponed untill the End of the War.  In the mean Time, our Brethren and Neighbours, virtuously struggling together with us for every Thing that is valuable, and reduced from Prosperity to Adversity by the casual Stroke of War, must not be left to suffer unnoticed. This would be plainly repugnant to the Dictates of Humanity, to the Precepts of Christian Charity, to the Rules of common Justice and the soundest Policy;(2) a Chain of Motives which doubtless produced the Grants already made by the General Assembly of our State, for the immediate Subsistence of these Sufferers. But, as the unfortunate Petitioners were deprived of their necessary Tools &: Materials for Business, it was remarked, by Gentlemen who pleaded for them in Congress, that an Advance sufficient to replace those Things would be a most essential Relief, and by far the most economical in the end. And it was suggested that such Estates of disaffected Persons as may be sequestered or confiscated, throughout the Limits of our Union, might be a Fund, to insure the Loan of Monies, for compensating patriotic Sufferers. This, however was not formally recommended Each State is competent to the Business, if judged proper.  Having represented this affair as it has been conducted in Congress, we wish it to be communicated by you to the Honorable House, for any Improvement which their Wisdom may direct.

  Sir Philadelphia May 21, 1777 The enclosed Letters came to hand yesterday by the Post. I was in doubt Whether it was best to Send them back, or keep them till you return here. I hope it will not be long before a Delegation arives, that I may have leave of absence. I understand that an Inhabitant of Connecticut has been lately executed by a Sentence of a General Court Martial.(1) I think it dangerous to admit Citizens not connected with the army to be tried by a Court Martial. The resolution of Congress concerning Spies does not warrant it-that respects only Such as are not Subjects of any of the States. It is easy to accuse any person with being a Spy & to put his life into the power of a Court Martial. I have no doubt but that the person executed was an attrocious offender & deserved Death but if he was an Inhabitant of the State he ought to have been tryed before the Supr. Court. We have nothing new here since my last. General Arnold is here. Congress has ordered the Quarter Master General to procure and present to him a Horse properly caparisoned for his Bravery in attacking the enemy who m[arched] to Danbury, in which action he had one horse killed under him and another wounded.(2) A Committee is appointed to consider what Honors are due to the Memory of Genll. Wooster.(3) There are different accounts of the day of his death. Some say Thursday, others MAY 21, 1777  Friday and others Saturday.

  My Dear Sir, Philadelphia 21st May 1777 Your favor of the 4th inst (No 6) came to hand this day. I had anticipated your desire in part having sent by Mr Campney some requisites which I hope are near at hand by this time. Mr. Frost arrived the 15th inst. By his credentials I find I am superseded, but as he tells me it was not the intention of the Assembly and is very desirous of my tarrying some time I shall not set out in less than two or three weeks when I think I shall bid farewell to Philadelphia and hope for the pleasure of taking you by the hand about the middle of June.  I rejoice at the arrival of Miller and hope Smith will be as fortunate though I confess my hopes have but little foundation as the enemy's ships are very thick off the Capes of Virginia and Delaware and I understand many are now cruizing on your coast which doubles the risk.  A ship arrived a few days ago at Cinapucksen from Nantz with 3 or 4000 arms and a large quantity of clothing. She brings no news that are at this time very interesting. All the public dispatches were to come in a packet that was to sail in a few days; perhaps she is already arrived at some distant port. Some other packets may also be expected soon. I expect to bring with me the Commissions for the new ship which is called the Ranger. I am inclined to think Capt Roche will not have the command of her; I do not interest myself either for or against him, but hope if he is removed a good man will have her.(1)  I am with much esteem and respect, Your friend and humble Servt.

I shall be on Horseback in a few Minutes, and then I shall enjoy the Morning, in more Perfection.  I spent last Evening at the War-Office, with General Arnold....(1) He has been basely slandered and libelled.(2) The Regulars say, \""he fought like Julius Caesar.\""  I am wearied to Death with the Wrangles between military officers, high and low. They Quarrell like Cats and Dogs. They worry one another like Mastiffs. Scrambling for Rank and Pay like Apes for Nutts.  I believe there is no one Principle, which predominates in human Nature so much in every stage of Life, from the Cradle to the Grave, in Males and females, old and young, black and white, rich and poor, high and low, as this Passion for Superiority.... Every human Being compares itself in its own Imagination, with every other round about it, and will find some Superiority over every other real or imaginary, or it will die of Grief and Vexation. I have seen it among Boys and Girls at school, among Lads at Colledge, among Practicers at the Bar, among the Clergy in their Associations, among Clubbs of Friends, among the People in Town Meetings, among the Members of an House of Representatives, among the Grave Councillors, on the more solemn Bench of Justice, and in that awfully August Body the Congress, and on many of its Committees-and among Ladies every Where-But I never saw it operate with such Keenness, Ferocity and Fury, as among military Officers. They will go terrible Lengths, in their Emulations, their Envy and Revenge, in Consequence of it.  So much for Philosophy. I hope my five or six Babes are all well. My Duty to my Mother and your Father and Love to sisters and Brothers, Aunts and Uncles.  Pray how does your Asparagus perform ? &c.

  Dear General Philadelphia 22d May 1777 The subject of your letter of the 17th is a very important one, and whilst it deserves the greatest attention, is certainly involved in great difficulty.(1) Of one truth however, I beg you Sir to be convinced. That no desire to get rid of importunity has occasioned these appointments, but motives military and political meerly. These Adventurers may be divided into three Classes, some who came early and without any recommendation but apparent zeal, with Commissions shewing that they had been in service-Others that brought with them recommendations from our good friend the Count D'Argout General of Martinique, and from Mr Bingham the Continental Agent in that Island-A third Class includes those who come from France, generally under agreement with our Commissioners, or one of them at least. The strongest obligations rest upon us (tho' the inconvenience is great) to make good engagements with the latter, and if the second had been disregarded we might have offended a good & powerful Friend in Martinique who has done many good offices there, or have brought our Agent into disrepute. Among the first Class, I realy believe there are many worthless Men, and I Heartily wish we were rid of them. All this is true, and yet I feel the great force of your reasoning, and the many difficulties in the way of providing for them properly and that may be tolerably agreeable to them. It is of some consequence that we all, [in] our several departments, endeavor to smooth this rugged business as much as possible. When Gen. Conway was appointed, I did hope that as he knew most of them, and spoke both French & English well, that he might relieve you from the greater part of this difficulty, for realy, the discontented importunity of the greater part of these Gentlen is too much [to] be borne under our various & important attentions. I will prevail with the Committee for foreign applications to furnish you  MAY 22, 1777  with the most explicit views of Congress in every appointment, as well as with the recommendations under which each appointment was and is made. We have written both to France & to Martinique to stop the further flow of these Gentlemen here, and after the letters arrive I suppose we shall have no more. Many of the last Comers are, I believe, Men of real merit, and if they will learn to express themselves tolerably in English, may be of service to the Army. The desire to obtain Engineers and Artillerists was the principal cause of our being so overburthened. The first that came had sagacity enough quickly to discern our wants, and professing competency in these branches They were too quickly believed. And when our Commissioners abroad (in consequence of directions for this purpose) enquired for those Artists, Military Speculation was immediately up, and recommendations were obtained from persons of so much consideration in France, that the success of our applications then made it quite necessary not to neglect them. And at this moment I am apprehensive that the discontent of many may injure our cause abroad where we would wish it to stand well. As you express it Sir, this affair requires great delicacy in its management, as well in the account of our own Officers as on that of these Foreigners.(2)  ""

  Dear sir Philada. May 22d. 1777 The Strange delays of Mr. Yancey here,(1) greatly mortifying to him, have drawn me on day by day from an earlier acknowledgment of your favor of Apr. 29th.  Indeed, I could not have related to you, before this time, any interesting decisions concerning such matters as have been moved in Congress connected with Tyconderoga.  Misconstructions of past resolves, and consequent jealousies, have produced a definition of the northern department; and General Schyler is ordered to take the command of it. The resolve also which was thought to fix Head Quarters at Albany is repealed.(2)  It was said you now look upon yourself in the same command which MAY 22, 1777  he had held. This was universally denyed to be the Intention of sending you to Tyconderoga to take command of the army there. The Debate in March was about the Adjutancy or Tyconderoga; and it was decided for the latter. In the present Debate I acknowledged it was my hope & wish, at the time you went, and still continue to be, that the officer who is at so very important a post shd. not be under the absolute orders of another at 100 miles distance, in treaty with Indians or busied in the duties of a Providore. This Idea was supported by several; and it is, of itself, an irrefragible argument of the impropriety of distributing America into departments. A commander-in-chief & Commanders of the seperate armies is the only distinction which should be known. However, that was contrary to our Journals. Besides, the army at Ty. and the force at Stanwix &c. &c. at a distance were looked upon as different subjects; tho it appears you have other ideas than those had who directed your destination. No single debate has been more tedious with us;- having lasted whole days & being finally settled 5 to 4 & 2 divided .(3)  Your dating from Albany is counted by some irreconcileable with the order to repair to Ty. I am sorry your letter to the President and that to myself did not arrive 1 hour earlier, or, had not arrived at all.(4)  I will write to you by the first opportunity after this, if I do not write again by Mr. Yancey.  Our Trouble has sprung from the difference between living in Albany Providore to ones own army 100 miles off, and living there Providore to another at the same distance, and that other not cordially liked.

  Respected Friend, Philadelphia May 22d. 1777.(1) Your Letter of Yesterday's Date advising me that mine of the 17th inst. had been laid before a Meeting of Friends convened for the Purpose of deliberating on Its Contents, I have taken into the most serious Consideration. The Sentiments conveyed in the first Paragraph are such as ought to influence every Member of Society of whatever religious Persuasion he may be, but more especially Christian, And altho' I differ with You on the Subject Matter of the next, I shall never the less not cease to respect & hold sacred the Rights of Conscience. From this Motive I shall no longer insist on a Contribution of Friends, for what they deem to be preparations for War: But as the first Principle of Human Nature is Self preservation; as we are engaged in a Conflict the Event of which must Either be a perfect Establishment of our Civil & Religious Priviledges or a Total Deprivation of both, It is a Duty incumbent on Us, in Order to avert the Latter, to embrace all Means made Lawful from the most evident Necessity, And altho' Friends cannot conscientiously give, Yet such is their Benevolence & Charity that I am sure rather than see Men suffer, they will acquiesce if We take at a just Valuation, a small Portion of What they can share. Directions must be given for that purpose & shall be conducted with all prudence & Tenderness for Civil Liberty, of which such an urgent & uncommon Case is capable.  On the other part of your Letter, I shall in General observe, that it is out of my sphere to enter into any political Disquisitions; that I am a Friend to All Mankind; that I wish to see Universal Happiness prevail & Every Member of every Society in the full Enjoyment of all their Rights; That my Application to the Friends for Blankets was forwarded on Information & Belief that they had not contributed on the Application of a Committee appointed by the Board of War; That I did not mean by the Discrimination to convey one disadvantageous Idea entertained of the Society of Friends; But meerly that they might be put on a Footing with the Other Members of the Community who as I was informed had Liberally contributed; That I shall waive animadverting on what was done by \""some Rich Men & others in their private Stations\"" ;(2) And that I thank You for the present of the Book You have been so kind as to send me and that altho' my Time is much engrossed, I shall read It with great Attention, convinced from its Character, that my Heart will be mended thereby, altho' I should not fully subscribe to every Part of the Doctrine it contains.

  Sir Philadelphia May 23d 1777 Since my last nothing has occurred worth your attention except the arrival of several supply ships, by which we have received many very important articles for facilitating the ensuing campaign. Our army is daily gaining strength, and I hope will before long be in a condition to face the enemy to some advantage. The enemy are unaccountably inactive, and cautious to the last degree. It is supposed they expect reinforcements, but we have accounts from Europe which indicate that they will in a great measure be disappointed. I have heard from our troops who are now under inoculation at Alexandria in Virginia, and two hundred who have had the small pox are on their march under Cols Summer and Lytle. I was informed they were much in want of shoes by reason of some disappointment in your Quartermaster's department. I applied to the Clothier General for a supply for them, and General Schuyler immediately sent them under the care of an officer to meet them at Baltimore.  We are alarmed with a report brought hither by a Mr Tenant from MAY 23, 1777  the Southward, that some persons in North Carolina have maliciously propagated a report that a very fatal infectious disease prevails in our army, and that the general belief thereof very much retards and injures the recruiting service. I am happy in having it in my power to declare that such report is entirely groundless and that our army is in very high health and spirits. The Congress have instituted a liberal medical arrangement, and put it under the immediate inspection of a Committee, of which I am a member. By this arrangement no diseased patients are suffered to remain in camp, not even any wounded patients who are incapable of duty: all such are immediately removed to hospitals remote from the quarters of the healthy troops, and, there, are carefully attended and supplied. Proper officers are appointed to superintend and direct every thing necessary for the sick and wounded, and to make regular returns to the medical Committee.1 By the last return very few appeared sick, in proportion to the numbers in service; and by every account from officers daily in this City from camp we learn that the army is very healthy. This information will enable your Excellency to refute the falsehood, and take off the evil impressions it may have made, and I am satisfied your endeavours for so good a purpose will not be wanting.  Since my last we have made no progress in the business of Confederation. A difficulty occurs, which, I fear, will be insuperable: that is how to secure to each State its separate independence, and give each its proper weight in the public Councils. So unequal as the States are, it will be nearly impossible to effect this: and after all it is far from improbable that the only Conferation will be a defensive alliance.  Nothing of importance has been determined in Congress, except what is merely executory.  I must beg leave again to complain of my receiving no information from my constituents You will excuse my uneasiness upon this account when you reflect, that I am charged with a very important trust, to which I feel myself very unequal, and in which I am most anxiously desirous of rendering every possible service to my country: that I have been without a Colleague ever since my arrival, and in great measure uninformed in what had been previously done. To be under such circumstances, and also uninformed of any contingencies which may make any alteration in the system of my country, you will readily admit is sufficient to make me uneasy. I shall however Sir, give unremitting attention to every matter which shall come before the Great Council of which I am a member, and decide on fixed principles and clear conviction as far as my understanding is competent. I doubt not my Country will believe my intentions to be what they wish, and my endeavours shall be the best my abilities will admit. I need not repeat my wish that greater services might be rendered by some abler hand.  I also beg leave to request your Excellency to inform me whether I am at liberty to return home during any time in this summer.(2)  Some ships are in the river, and the Marine of this State are ordered down. Some of us are resolved to go down, and observe at least the conflict, if any there may be. I am called away and therefore must conclude. Having the honor to be Your Excellency's most Obedient hum. Sert. Thos Burke  P.S. In one of my letters I believe I mentioned that Georgia was of no use in Congress but to vote with Connecticut. This was owing I believe to this circumstance, only one Delegate was then present, who is by birth a Connecticut man.(3) Since then a Mr Walton has given his attendance, which was before interrupted by illness; and I perceive Georgia is now frequently divided when any question relates to Colonial politics, so that these two Delegates are of different principles, or different judgments.

  Honble Gentlemen Philadelphia May 23d.1777 Since our arrival here we have not been honored, but with one public Letter, which we ascribe to the Multiplicity of Business in which our Convention has been involved. It was by accident that we procured a Copy of the ordinance for establishing a temporary Government in our State, which has enabled us to address ourselves to your honorable Body MAY 23, 1777  The new Delegation transmitted by the Secretary has reached us. Rest assured that our most zealous Efforts shall be strenuously exerted to promote the general Good and Happiness of the united States, as well as the Honor, Interest and Security of our more immediate Constituents.  General Schuyler is fully reinstated in his Command, every point being adjusted entirely to his and our Satisfaction. This Business with which more than the Reputation of our State was so closely connected required Address and great attention for Reasons which the General, who delivers this, can explain.  We shall now have Leisure to turn our Thoughts to the Subjects of our Instructions,(1) which we shall diligently pursue and flatter ourselves with the wished for Success. The Revolt in our State cannot but be considered as a dangerous and alarming Example. Every Country is plagued with profligate and ambitious Men who in Times like the present may find it their Interest, or be led by their Passions to bring on Revolutions. Good Policy must therefore dictate to all the Necessity of discouraging this factious and turbulent Spirit, and of securing to every State its proper Rights and Jurisdiction, as well against internal as foreign Enemies.  We fear the Consideration of the Boundaries of New York has, thro' the Multiplicity of Business, been deferred. If so, we submit to your honorable Body, whether it ought not now to be dispatched, especially as the Convention, by one of their Letters,(2) stood pledged, to give Congress full Information on that Subject, and we can assure you it is expected.  General Schuyler, one of our Brethren, will take an oppertunity of conferring with your Honorable Body, on some other points which materially concern our State; the Discussion of them here must be therefore unnecessary. Permit us only most earnestly to press you to pursue the plan of manufacturing salt in the Interior parts of our State, with unremitting Vigor. As long as the war continues we must, from the exposed Situation of our Sea ports, be distressed for this necessary article of Life, if we trust to a foreign Supply. A temporary Relief we shall endeavor to procure, tho' it must be at a most enormous Expence. We are confident that Congress will chearfully interpose every good office to assist us.

  Philadelphia May 24. 1777 We have an Army in the Jersies, so respectable that We seem to be under no Apprehensions at present, of an Invasion of Philadelphia- at least untill a powerfull Reinforcement shall arrive from Europe. When that will be and how powerfull, it is impossible to say: But I think, it will not be very soon, nor very strong.  Perhaps, the Troops from Canada may come round by Water. If they do, the whole Force they can make, with all the Reinforcements from Europe will do no great Things this Year. I think, our Cause will never again be in so low a state as it was last December-then was the Crisis.  There are four Men of War and four Tenders in Delaware Bay. The Roebuck, and a Fifty Gun ship, and two other Frigates, are the Men of War. They come up the River a little Way to get Water some times with Fear and Trembling, and dare not come up far enough to get fresh Water, but content themselves with brackish Water.  They go on shore sometimes to steal some lean Cattle, if any happen to wander into lonely Places, where they dare venture.  My Love to all.  ""

  Philadelphia May 24. 1777 During the civil Wars in Rome, in the Time of Sylla,(1) and young Marius, after the death of the Elder Marius, Sylla commanded one Army against Mithridates King of Pontus, and Fimbria another. Both were in Arms against the Same foreign Enemy: but Sylla and Fimbria were equally Enemies to each other, commanding different Armies in the service of different Parties at Rome, which were disputing which had the legal Authority. Sylla patched up a Peace with Mithridates and marched against Fimbria. The two Generals fortified their Camps. The Soldiers of both Armies, of the Same Nation, the Same City, the Same Language, Religion, Manners, Tastes and Habits instead of Skirmishing with each other, when they met upon Parties for Forage, Saluted one another, with great Cordiality. Some from Fimbria's Camp, MAY 24, 1777  came Secretly into that of Sylla, to see their Friends. In these clandestine Visits, Syllas soldiers, instructed by their General, and furnished with Money, won over those of Fimbria by Secret Bribes. These returning, corrupted others: many came off in the Night. The desertion became General. Shame and Punishment lost their Influence, and at last whole Companies carried off their Colours to Sylla.  Fimbria finding himself betrayed, solicited an Interview with Sylla but being denyed it, returned to Pergamus, entered the Temple of Esculapius, and ran himself through with his sword.(2)  After this Sylla began his March from Asia towards Italy. The two Consulls, Cinna and Carbo, hearing of his design ordered young Marius and other Leaders of their Party to raise Forces, and commit the Legions, required the assistance of the Samnites and formed different Armies to oppose him. At the next Election Scipio and Norbanus were chosen Consulls in the Room of Cinna & Carbo. Sylla landed at Brundusium and began his March, and was joined by Metellus Pius, a Proconsul, as Sylla was, and by Pompey. Sylla, who had brought back with him from Asia not more than Thirty Thousand Men, was much pleased with these Allies; because his Enemies had 450 Ensigns of Foot in several Bodies, besides their Cavalry, the whole commanded by 15 General officers, at the Head of whom were Scipio and Norbanus, who as Consulls had the chief Command.  Sylla, as great a Master of Intrigue as of the military Art, surrounded by so many different Enemies, joined Craft to his Valour. Scipio was encamped near him. To him, Sylla sends deputies to make overtures, who artfully represented that he was grieved at the Calamities to which the Commonwealth must be exposed, by a civil War, whoever should prevail, and that he only desired to lay down his Arms with Honor. Scipio, Sincerely desiring Peace, and misled by such plausible Proposals, desired Time to communicate them to Norbanus, and agreed to a Truce between the two Camps in the mean Time. Syllas Soldiers, by favour of this Truce insinuated themselves into Scipios Camp, under Pretense of visiting their Friends, and having before in Fimbrias Affair learned the Artifice, brought over many to their Party with Bribes. Carbo said upon this, that in Sylla he had to encounter both a Fox and a Lion; but that the Lion gave him much less Trouble than the Fox.  Sylla, sure of a great Number of Scipios Soldiers, presented himself before his Camp. The soldiers upon Guard, instead of charging him, saluted him as their general, and let him into their Camp. He made himself master of the whole so suddenly, that Scipio knew nothing of it, untill he and his son were arrested in his own Tent.  The next year Carbo, and young Marius, 26 years old, were chosen Consulls. The Armies took the Field, as early as the Season would permit, in the Spring. Marius at the Head of 85 Cohorts, offered Battle to Sylla, who having a secret Intelligence in his Enemys Camp, ac-  cepted the Challenge. Both Armies fought with great Bravery, the soldiers of each Side resolving to vanquish or to die. Fortune had not yet declared for either, when some Squadrons of Marius's Army, and five cohorts of his left Wing that had been bribed with Silla's Money, caused a Confusion by their unseasonable Flight, as they had agreed with Sylla to do. Their Example drew many others after them: a general Terror Struck the rest of the Army, and it was at last more a Rout than a Battle.  Howe is no Sylla, but he is manifestly aping two of Syllas Tricks, holding out Proposals of Terms and bribing soldiers to desert but you see, he is endeavouring to make a Fimbria of somebody. Many of the Troops from Pensilvania, Maryland and Virginia, are Natives of England, Scotland and Ireland, who have adventured over here and been sold for their Passages, or transported as Convicts and have lived and served here as Coachmen, Hostlers, and other servants.  They have no Tie to this Country. They have no Principles. They love Howe as well as Washington, and his Army better than ours. These Things give Howe great opportunities to corrupt and Seduce them.

  Dr Papa, 24th May 1777 There are ten ships in the Bay coming up towards Newcastle: 1 fifty gun ship, 1 forty four, 2 frigates, a Brig & 4 Tenders & a pilot boat, no transports We imagine these ships are come up to water & get live stock.  The enemy are yet quiet: I suppose they will not attempt any thing of consequence till they receive reinforcements from Europe. By the time those reinforcements arrive, I hope G. Washington's army will be respectable. We have made no progress in the Confederacy, things of more immediate necessity have taken up our time. We are endeavouring to reform the Commissary's Department. The Quarter Master General's is put on a better footing. Pray have any considerable payts. been made to you since I left home? Has the Vineyard suffered? Last Sunday I rode to see the Vineyard 5 miles off from this city. It is in bad order. The vines are chiefly the murnier Burgundy, he has one sort (the names of which he knew not) of which I have bespoke cuttings. G. Cadwallader has promised to procure for me some rooted plants of Jones Vines. You remember they are mentioned in the Pena. Philosophical publication. I hear our assembly is to be called the 2d of next month. I shall not attend it, being determined to make a long session in Congress, and then enjoy a little quiet at Home. I assure you I am sick of public business, nothing but a strong Sense of duty, and the great importance of the cause we are engaged in could keep me here. G. Shuyler will Set off in a day or two to take the command in the northern Depart. This measure will greatly displease Gates, & perhaps occasion his resignation, but justice is due to Shuyler. Gates probably will go & command at Boston. His depart. is not yet fixed. I wish he would act as adjutant General, in which office I think he would be able to render the most essential services, but this I fear we shall not prevail on him to accept.  I hope you have had a pleasant jaunt and that it has agreed with you. If Mr. & Mrs. Ridout should be with you, please to present my complts to them and to all enquiring friends.

  Gent. Philad. Saturday, 12 oClock, 24 May 1777 (1) Enclosed you have the account of the printers of the Continental Money that will ascertain the Terms on which the money was printed.(2) I have examined the Barracks, they are all of a Size above & below each room 16 ft Square and about 9 ft in Height.  We have no Intelligence from the Camp except that the Enemy are fortifying the Town of Brunswick and have launched into water the Boats that were hoisted into Waggons to pass as it was conjectured the Delaware .  They play the very Devil with the Tories in Connecticut & New York. In a late Hunt for them several were apprehended with Commissions from Howe. They were immediately hung up & executed. Among them were two, one with a Captains the other with a Lieutenants Commission. These poor Dogs had no notion to the last Hour that they would be hanged, they thought and treated it as merely in Terrorem when they came to the Place of Execution. Why damn it says the Lieutenant the Rebels surely w'ont have the Impudence to hang us. By G-d says the Capt. it looks as if they would and I dare say they would if they dared. They had no Time for further Conversation.  Yesterday the Alarm Gun was fired and to Day an Express informs us of ten Sail coming up the River: a fifty Gun Ship-the Roebuck of forty four Guns-a Frigate-four Tenders-a Brig and two Pilot Boats. The Gondolas are gone down. The Congress has adjourned to go down in Barges to see the Sport.  Congress took up Capt Nicholsons Affair and were unanimously of opinion he had not made the Satisfaction he ought to have made and on Examination of the order from the Marine Committee with Respect to the impress'd men they found that Committee had acted very unwarrantably in explaining the Resolve of Congress on that Subject in such a narrow limited Sence.(3) Congress meant every man to be discharged without any discrimination of such as subscribed the Articles and took the Bounty and the Resolve was full & explicit to that Purpose. The Marine Committee were severely handled for presuming to explain at all the Resolve but the more reprehensible for giving a Sence to it which might have defeated the whole Design of it. Mr. Carroll & I were directed to prepare a fresh set of Resolutions. We did so one of which declared Capt. Nicholson dismiss'd from the Command of the Virginia frigate for not making that full satisfaction to the Governor & Council of Mary[lan]d which by a former Resolve of Congress he was ordered to do. A second resolve restored him to his Command on his explicit Disapprobation of his Letter & a third Resolve ordered the commanding officer of the Frigate to deliver up every impress'd man who should be considered such by any Persons the Governor & Council MAY 24, 1777  should send on Board for the Purpose of making the Enquiry. These Resolutions would have passed unanimously but Mr. Lewis coming up and assuring us of his having Conversations with our Council who declared they would be satisfied with the Concessions which were contained in Nicholsons first Letter and which were satisfactory to the Governor and Mr Lewis further assuring us that Capt. Nicholson had wrote a second Letter in Consequence thereof and discharged every man who did not chuse to remain, we have been induced from these assurances to postpone doing any thing in the matter till we hear further from you on the Subject. Mr. Lewis further says that Capt. Nicholson is about joining the Virginia arm'd Vessels with an Intent to attack the Man of War in the Bay. I can with pleasure inform you the Congress shewed a determined Spirit to give full Satisfaction on both points and I am confident they would have dismiss'd Capt. Nicholson without Hesitation if we had not proposed to restore him on his explicit disapprobation of his Letter which was the Satisfaction you in your's to him demanded: you may be further assured Capt. Nicholson had not even an Intimation from Congress or Committees to impress. I am surprised that Mr. Rumsey who was on the Marine Committee approved of the Explanation they gave the Resolve to discharge the impress'd men. Mr. Middleton who was also a member of that Committee told Congress he opposed it in the Marine Committee as an illegal assumption of Power. As the Question was agitated there how could our friend Rumsey suffer such a thing to be done? You'll be pleased to let us have a Line from you as soon as possible.  Generals Schuyler, Arnold & Miflin are in Town and propose to accompany us down to the expected Engagement.  Our Army begins to make a very formidable Figure. They were well [...] and handsomely uniformed in their D[....] They are dress'd Soldier like from [. . .] to Shoe.  I am Gent, Yr. most obed hb. st., Wm.

  May 25. 1777 At half past four this Morning, I mounted my Horse, and took a ride, in a Road that was new to me. I went to Kensington, and then to Point No Point, by Land, the Place where I went, once before, with a large Company in the Rowe Gallies, by Water. That Frolic was almost two Years ago. I gave you a Relation of it, in the Time, I suppose. The Road to Point No Point lies along the River Delaware, in fair Sight of it, and its opposite shore. For near four Miles the Road is as strait as the Streets of Philadelphia. On each Side, are beautifull Rowes of Trees, Buttonwoods, Oaks, Walnutts, Cherries and Willows, especially down towards the Banks of the River. The Meadows, Pastures, and Grass Plotts, are as Green as Leeks. There are many Fruit Trees and fine orchards, set with the nicest Regularity. But the Fields of Grain, the Rye, and Wheat, exceed all Description. These Fields are all sown in Ridges; and the Furrough between each Couple of Ridges, is as plainly to be seen, as if a sower had been mown along. Yet it is no wider than a Plough share, and it is as strait as an Arrow. It looks as if the Sower had gone along the Furrough with his Spectacles to pick up every grain that should accidentally fall into it.  The Corn is just coming out of the Ground. The Furroughs struck out for the Hills to be planted in, are each Way, as straight as mathematical right Lines; and the Squares between every four Hills, as exact as they could be done by Plumb and Line, or Scale and Compass.  I am ashamed of our Farmers. They are a lazy, ignorant sett, in Husbandry, I mean-For they know infinitely more of every Thing else, than these. But after all the Native Face of our Country, diversified as it is, with Hill and Dale, Sea and Land, is to me more agreable than this enchanting artificial scaene.  May 27. The Post brought me yours of May 6th and 9th.  You express Apprehensions that We may be driven from this City. We have No such Apprehensions here. Howe is unable to do any Thing but by Stealth. Washington is strong enough to keep Howe, where he is.  How could it happen that you should have 25 of counterfeit New Hampshire Money? Cant you recollect who you had it of? Let me intreat you not to take a shilling of any but continental Money, or Massachusetts-and be very carefull of that. There is a Counterfeit Continental Bill abroad sent out of New York but it will deceive none but Fools, for it is Copper Plate-easily detected, miserably done.  ""

  My dear Sir Philadelphia May 26. 1777 I had this Morning, the Pleasure of your Favour of the Sixteenth inst, by the Post; and rejoice to learn that your Battallions, were so far fill'd, as to render a Draught from the Militia, unnecessary. It is a dangerous Measure, and only to be adopted in great extremities, even by popular Governments. Perhaps, in Such Governments Draughts will never be made, but in Cases, when the People themselves see the Necessity of them. Such Draughts are widely different from those made by Monarchs, to carry on Wars, in which the People can see no Interest of their own nor any other object in View, than the Gratification of the Avarice, Ambition, Caprice, Envy, Revenge, or Vanity of a Single Tyrant. Draughts in the Massachusetts, as they have been there managed, have not been very unpopular, for the Persons draughted are commonly the wealthiest, who become obliged to give large Premiums, to their poorer Neighbours, to take their Places.  The great Work of Confederation, draggs heavily on, but I dont despair of it. The great and Small States must be brought as near together as possible: and I am not without Hopes, that this may be done, to the tolerable Satisfaction of both. Your Suggestion, Sir, that any Proposition may be negatived, by the Representatives of a Majority of the People, or of a Majority of States, shall be attended to, and I will endeavour to get it introduced, if We cannot Succeed in our Wishes for a Representation and a Rule of voting, perfectly equitable, which has no equal, in my Mind.(1)  Nothing gives me, more constant Anxiety, than the Delays, in publishing the Journals.(2) Yet I hope, Gentlemen will have a little Patience with Us. We have had a Committee constantly attending to this very Thing, for a long Time. But we have too many Irons in the Fire, you know for Twenty Hands, which is nearly the whole Number We have had upon an Average Since, last fall. The Committee are now busy, every day in correcting Proof Sheets, So that I hope We Shall Soon do better.  A Committee on the Post office, too, have found, a thousand difficulties. The Post is now very regular, from the North and South, altho it comes but once a Week. It is not easy to get faithfull Riders, to go oftener. The Expence is very high, and the Profits, (so dear is every Thing, and so little Correspondence is carried on, except in franked Letters), will not Support the office. Mr. Hazard is now gone Southward, in the Character of Surveyor of the Post office, and I hope will have as good Success, as he lately had eastward, where he has put the office into good order.  We have no News from Camp, but that the General and Army are in good Spirits, and begin to feel themselves powerfull. We are  MAY 26, 1777  anxiously waiting for News from abroad, and for my own Part I am apprehensive of some insidious Maneuvre from Great Britain, to deceive Us into Disunion and then to destroy.  We want your Industry and Abilities here extreamly. Financiers, we want more than Soldiers. The worst Enemy, we have now is Poverty, real Poverty in the Shape of exuberant Wealth. Pray come and help Us, to raise the Value of our Money, and lower the Prices of Things. Without this, We cannot carry on the War. With it, we can make it a Diversion .  No poor Mortals were ever more perplexed than we have been, with three Misfortunes at once, any one of which would have been, alone, sufficient to have distressed Us. A Redundancy of the Medium of Exchange. A Diminution of the Quantity, at Markett of the Luxuries, the Conveniences and even the Necessaries of Life, and an Increase of the Demand for all these, occasioned by two large Armies in the Country.  I shall, ever esteam it a Happiness to hear of your Welfare, my dear Sir, and a much greater Still to see you, once more in Congress.

  My dear Sir, Philadelphia May 26. 1777 If I have contributed in any degree to your satisfaction or enabled you to combat false news intended to injure the cause of America, I am happy. I love the cause, and I have faithfully exerted myself to serve it well. Provided America be free and happy, I am not solicitous about the Agents that accomplish it. For this reason Sir, I look with indifference on the malice of my enemies, trusting that the wisdom of my Country will employ in its great concerns, such men only, as are of known uniform attachment to the cause of America, and who possess wisdom, integrity, and industry. But it has ever been my wish to deserve the esteem of virtuous men, and to stand well in their opinion. Upon this principle I hope for your pardon when I trouble you with a detail of the lease business .(1) From motives of private ease and as I thought of public good, if the same plan were generally adopted in Vir- MAY 26, 1777  ginia, I determined some years ago to break up my quarters, and rent out all my lands to a number of industrious men, who might benefit themselves, and ease me of trouble at the same time. As the support of a numerous family depended entirely upon those rents, I was brought to the alarming situation of seeing that family infinitely distressed when the Association took place, by the Tenants not paying me, assigning for reason that they could not sell their produce. The present evil was then great and pressing, and well knowing the determination of Great Britain to push her ruinous system, which wd of course drive America into a long and expensive war, that could only be supported by immense emissions of paper money, which falling in value with its excessive quantity would render my small income (but barely sufficient with the greatest economy to maintain my family in the best times) totally insufficient, I did propose to Colo Marshal (who was one of my Tenants & a Collector for me in Fauquier) so early as August 1775 to offer, by himself and Mr. Blackwell, to my Tenants, such a change of rent as might enable them to pay, prevent my total ruin, and at the same time be not injurious to them; since the plenty of money here after which might lessen its value, would certainly raise the price of all their produce. This proposition you will observe Sir, was made in August 1775, at a time when emissions of money for this war were scarcely begun, and when of course, the malignant insinuation of my enemies could not have existed with me, that of depreciating a currency not yet in being. And it is worthy of remark, that in Augt. 1776, the Tenants of Loudon County did themselves petition the Convention (if I forget not) to have their money rents changed to produce. Colo. Marshall very much approved the reasonableness of my proposal, and promised to offer the matter to the consideration of the Tenants. I returned here to Congress, and Colo. Marshall soon after went into the military line, so that nothing, that I know of, was done in this business until March 1776 when yet very little money had been issued, and when of course this alteration could not possibly have had the least effect upon the credit of the paper money. At that time, for reasons already mentioned, I had for more than a year received little or no support from my estate to the great injury of my family; and being obliged to return here, I engaged Mr Parker of Westmoreland to go up to Fauquier and propose to the Tenants to alter the rents to Tobacco at a price mutually to be agreed on. This he did, and returned to me the alterations agreed on by all the Tenants near Fauquier Court House, except two or three.(2) It was then upon two principles that this change took place, first to put it in the power of the Tenant to pay me what was then and might become due, and secondly to prevent thereafter the excessive and partial injury that might be derived to me from emissions of paper money not then in existence. Would any but bad Men, hardly pressed for argument against an innocent Character, have   misrepresented, and miscalled this absolutely faultless and justifiable conduct, a design to injure the public by depreciating the currency? But the truth is Sir, that certain evil disposed Men hate me partly for the same reason that I am devoted to destruction in the Enemies Camp, because I have served my Country with unremitting zeal and industry, and in concert with other generous friends to human liberty and the rights of America, have gone far towards defeating our enemies, and raising America triumphant over its cruel, vindictive, and determined foes. But it seems there are two other charges equally futile and false; the one, that I have favored New England to the injury of Virginia. The other, that as a Member of the Secret Committee I objected to their proceedings being laid before Congress, meaning to insinuate that I wished to conceal embezlement of the public money! The Wretch who carried, or sent this last account to Virginia, knows perfectly well that my total abstraction from every Commercial concern renders it impossible that I can propose any kind of good to myself from trading business of any sort. But I have a strong belief that a change is wished in order to remove obstruction feared from me, and to prepare the way for the execution of private plans in which the public will not be gainers. The affair alluded to is, I suppose, a very inconsiderate motion made at Baltimore for the Secret Committee to lay all its proceedings before Congress. I observed that so extensive a motion defeated the very end for which such a Committee was appointed, and might expose to danger valuable Cargoes that should be coming in, or that might be going out, particularly the former. The motion was narrowed, and even so it was agreed to. Mr. Morris the Chairman of the Committee who was here at the time, did by Letter so convince the Congress of the impropriety of the order even as it passed, that nothing more was said about it.(3) We did indeed expect at that very time the arrival of the valuable Stores that have since come in. The charge of favoring New England is so contemptibly wicked that I can scarcely bring myself to the trouble of refuting it, or to trespass on your time to read my observations on it. Our enemies and our friends too, know that America can only be conquered by disunion. The former, by unremitting art had endeavored to incite jealousy and discord between the Southern and Eastern Colonies, and in truth Sir they had so far prevailed that it required constant attention, and a firmness not to be shaken, to prevent the malicous art of our enemies from suc4ceeding. I am persuaded as I am of my existence, that had it not been for Virginia and Jersey, with Georgia sometimes, that our Union would eer now have been by this means broken like a Potters vessel dashed against a rock and I heartily wish that this greatest of all political evils may not yet take place before a safe and honorable peace is established. I am sure it will not be the fault of many men that I know if this worst does not happen. I defy the poisonous tongue of slander to produce a single instance in which I  have preferred the interest of New England to that of Virginia. Indeed I am at a Loss to know wherein their interests clash. The guilt of New England is that of a fixed determination against British Tyranny, & such I believe is the crime of Virginia in the eye of their common enemies. Most of the rest have entitled themselves to some hopes of pardon from the Tyrant, by weak, dividing, irresolute and pernicious conduct. One thing is certain, that among the Middle and Southern states Virginia had many enemies, arising from jealousy and envy of her wisdom, vigor, and extent of Territory. But I have ever discovered, upon every question, respect and love for Virginia among the Eastern Delegates. Folly and ingratitude would have marked the Representatives of Virginia had they shown disesteem for the latter, and attachment to the former. I have served my Country, Sir, to the best of my knowledge, and with fidelity and industry, to the injury of my health, fortune, and a sequestration from domestic happiness. I shall rejoice to find that others are employed, who will do the business better than I have done. It will always make me happy to reflect, that those Malignants who would represent me as an enemy to my Country, cannot make me so.  I am ready to give my enemies credit for more address than I thought they possessed-I mean the use they make of a good principle under cover of which to wound me. For this purpose the Delegates time of service is to be so limited as to reward a three years painful employ by dismission. The plan is precisely fitted for my ease, and thus the most malicious, groundless, and infamous slander is likely to succeed against an absent Man, who has labored to deserve a better fate. You will make what use you please of this letter. The business of war remains as when I wrote you last, except that the American Army is daily increasing, whilst that of the enemy is only added to by a few Tories as yet, tho they will I expect in a month or so be reinforced with 8 or 10,000 men from Europe, which will not make them so strong as when they began the Campaign last year, whilst our Army will be far more formidable. Gen. Washington has now about 10,000 regular Troops with him, and his numbers daily increasing. As far as we are able to learn the enemy have not now in Jersey so many as 5000. By accounts just from New York we hear of the death of Governor Tryon of the wounds he received in the expedition to Danbury, and also of the death of Colo. Woolcot from the same cause.(4) This was the Colonel that made such indecent observations of Gen. Washington's proposal in exchange of prisoners. Tis said that the Officers in N. York look very grave and say all hope of conquest over America is now gone, unless they can succeed in dividing us. The inclosed resolve of Congress is intended to prevent injury to the recruiting business and other public service in the absence of a General Officer from Virginia.(5)   I beg your pardon Sir for the trouble I have given you, and wish to be considered affectionately yours, Richard Henry Lee  ""

  My dear Sir, Philadelphia 26 May 1777 Finding by your letter of this post to your brother that you suppose I have been negligent in my correspondence with you, my chief purpose here is to remove that charge. I do not remember which of us is debtor on the letter score, but as far as I do recollect I think I was the writer, not the Receiver of the last letter. However this may be, it appeared the less necessary for me to write, as I knew Mr. Page furnished you with regular intelligence of what passed in the war department, besides which, I had nothing worth troubling you with, or calling my attention from the busy scene around me.  I observe in the Gazette, your call upon our Countrymen to apply  MAY 26, 1777  some of their attention to the business of philosophy.(1) Your reasoning is just, and I hope will have its due weight. I am sure that some among us have abundant necessity both for the study and the practise of the Moral part of that noble science. If this had been better learned, such an industrious attempt to injure my reputation in the opinion of my Countrymen would not have taken place. It has been a wicked industry, the most false, and the most malicious that the deceitful heart of man ever produced. I am not on my own account affected with this malice of my enemies, because I have long panted for retirement from the most distressing pressure of business that I ever had conception of. But my principal concern arises from the dreadful example my case presents, to cool the arder of patriotism, and prevent the sacrifice of private ease to public service. I ought at least to have been heared in my defence. But Sir I will not trouble you with my feelings.  The enemies expected reenforcements from Europe have not yet arrived, in consequence of which, our army in Jersey outnumbers theirs considerably, but since they do expect 8 or 10,000 men from beyond the Atlantic, and may bring the greatest part of their force round from Canada in order to make one last dying effort, it behooves us to be prepared to meet the desperate designs of desperate men. If no disappointment takes place, when their whole force is collected, I do not think they will be so strong as when the field was taken last year, and the American Army promises to be much more formidable. Skirmishing still continues, and still we keep the superiority, insomuch that by the late maneuvres of the enemy, it seems not improbable that they intend to quit Jersey soon. They paid severely for their provision destroying excursion to Danbury, where besides their disgraceful flight, they did not loose less than 450 or 500 men killed & wounded. Governor Tryon, late a Major General, and Colo. Wolcot, are both dead of the wounds they received in that chace. The last accounts from York tell us, that the British Officers look grave, and say, all hope of conquering America but by disuniting it is now lost. Great efforts will be made this year for that purpose, and no act or expence omitted to obtain by fraud what force has failed to procure, the Court favorite \""Subduction of America.\""  We hear that in the West Indies French Privateers abound under Continental Commissions, which I think cannot fail to procure war if Great Britain is not dead to every feeling except resentment for the Virtue of their once affectionate brethren and fellow subjects. The inclosed pamphlet is well written, and will I hope amuse you. Be pleased to give my brother Thom the reading of it when you have finished it.  Adieu my dear Sir, I am your affectionate Kinsman, Richard Henry Lee [P.S.] I hope to see you e'er long in Williamsburg.(2)  ""

  Sir Philada. May 26th. 1777 This will be delivered to you by a German officer who expresses much inclination to enter into the army under your command.(1)  The trouble which your Excellency receives from Foreigners commissioned by Congress has made the Committee, appointed to examine their pretensions, averse to offering any resolutions for places above the rank of subalterns.  The Bearer speaks English very well, and has an honorable character in a letter from Doctor Franklin, with 4 commissions proving his regular service.  I have told him that, notwithstanding these advantages, he cannot expect any place till you have pointed out a situation wherein he may subserve the interest of these United States.  The resolute importunity of some strangers of less desert has, I fear, gained the post which would be better filled by this modest veteran.  The promotion of Monsr. Armand by Congress to the rank of Colonel was a surprize to the Committee who had considered his pretensions, and rashly enough in all conscience had proposed a majority for him.(2)  With affectionate Respect, I am, Your Excellency's Most obedient Friend, James Lovell  ""

  Dear Brother Philadelphia, May 26th 1777. In your Letter to me you refered me to Colo. Nelson for News, he has left us for some time,(1) and as I was anxious to hear particularly from Virginia, I took the Liberty of opening your Letter to him, which I now enclose, that you may know its' fate. We have no News here, except a Report which is well founded, that Genl. Tryon and Lieutt. Colo. Wallcot are both dead of the Wounds which they recd. in their expedition against Danbury. I shall be much obliged to you to send me weekly the Journals of our Assembly, tho' I do not expect to stay long to read them; for I understand there is to be an entire change in the Delegation from Virga. I wrote you my sentiments upon that Head by the last post.(2) One thing I would wish you to urge to your friends in the Assembly, which is that every person who is appointed a Delegate to Congress should decline all foreign Commerce in which he may be then engaged, & be bound during the time of his Delegation not to enter into any foreign commercial Business, either directly on his own Acct., or indirectly by joining in Partnership with any person whatever. The necessity we are under of making Returns in our Produce to Europe for the Supplies which we have imported from thence for the Use of our Army renders this Caution proper. This is generally purchased by Agents who are usually nominated by the Delegates of the respective States. If the merchant Delegate should want a little honesty, & should have Interest to get one of his Partners, who may be as little scrupleous as himself, appointed an Agent, they may apply the Money advanced for the public Service to their own Uses, & the Agent by purchasing certain Commodities which his Partner the Delegate may inform him will shortly be wanted by the Public, & afterwards by selling to the public at an advanced Price, they may replace the Money which ought to have been laid out for the public, & by that means make great Profit to themselves upon the ruin of the Continent. Again,  MAY 26, 1777  if the Person who exports the produce to foreign Ports or the Delegate should be concerned in Trade, they may manage their Affairs so that every Cargo which is taken by the Enemy will belong to the public, & everyone which arrives safe will be private Property. Neither is it possible to detect the Villainy, for the confidence placed in the Delegate, & the Opinion entertained of the Agent who has the Recommendation & Support of the Delegate will prevent all Suspicions; but if they should arise, & an Enquiry into the Matter be insisted on, they may by many artful ways evade a Settlement 'til they hear the Fate of the Cargoes which they have shiped. I do not know whether any thing of the Sort has happened, but it is best to guard against the worst.  As to the Seal I fear it cannot be made here; the Man who was employed about it is in Prison for [Tompson?]; Colo. Nelson promised to carry the Print to Virga which was left in the Care of Mr. Purviance at Baltimore when we came from thence. Please to give my Love to my Sister. I am dear Brother, Your's affectionately,  Mann Page Junr.  ""

  My dear General Philada May 26th. 1777(1) I have known nothing but Affliction ever since I had the honor of seeing you last and was a Subject of your great humanity and politeness, for which you have my most sincere thanks, when I was reduced to the lowest Ebb of Life in New Jersey, but the affliction I suffered in my own person and all the Sorrows of my whole life accumulated, are not to be compared with that awful stroke of Providence which deprived me of my Dr. Mrs. Roberdeau. I know your generous Breast feels for my distress with which I do not intend to take up more of your precious time than to offer it as an apology that I have not presented my acknowledgement sooner.  Congress has this day made a new arrangement of the Chaplains department by reducing that part of the Staff to one for each Brigade to be recommended by the Brigadier and appointed by Congress, with the pay, rations and Forrage allowed to Colonels.(2)  This new and honorable Establishment is designed to suppress the horrid Sins of Cursing, swearing and other Vices with which I am sorry to say our Army Vies with the most abandoned of the English Troops; to strengthen the Officers hands by publick and private exorta- MAY 26, 1777  tions to obedience of General and Regimental Order; to discourage Disertions by recommending the Service, to encourage Enlistments; to recommend cleanlyness as a virtue conducive to health, and to reprehend the neglect of it. These and other valuable Ends with the Countinance and concurrence of General Officers by the blessing of heaven I doubt not may be answered by a careful choice and recommendation of pious Clergymen jealously attached to our glorious Cause who will not begrudge the exertion of every nerve of the Service but if Drones induced by the loaves and Fishes should creep into the Army, the designs of Congress will be entirely defeated, to prevent which I frankly confess has induced me to step out of my line on this Occasion, and I beg you will not look upon it as an impudent intrusion on you, when I assure you the honor of God, my Countries welfare, your Comfort and that of every sober Officer and man in the Army are my only motives. With submission I think an early recommendation to Congress will be best in every view, particularly to prevent the application of such as would mar instead of promoting the Service, and as I know you may have what influence you please with the Genl. Officers in this measure, for these Reasons permit me to mention at the foot of this some Gentlemen who would be of great Service in our Army, as probably you are not as well acquainted with that order of Gentlemen, zealously attached to our Cause, as I am. The Names that have occurred to me are chiefly of the Church I belong to, but believe me no partiallity has influenced to this but my greater knowledge of such is the occasion. The four last mentioned Gentlemen I am not personally acquainted with but all the others I speak of from my own knowledge as persons well qualified to serve the valuable purposes already mentioned. I plead no right to this freedom much less Do I presume on my publick Character but solely from the motives I have professed above and free from every solicitation.  Congress has this day refered to you the nomination of any of the General Officers already appointed to the command of the horse. I fear your censure of my freedom but relying on your candour I remain with unfeigned regard and profound Respect, Dear General, Yr. much obliged & obt, huml Servt .

  Sir Philadelphia May 26 1777.  I do myself the Honor to return sincere thanks to Congress for the attention and Justice I have experienced, from that respectable Body, MAY 26, 1777  since my arrival in this City. I entreat you Sir, to assure them that I entertain the most grateful Feilings on the Occasion, and that I shall by a steady and zealous perseverance in the Line of my Duty strive to merit a Continuance of their Confidence; that I shall most assiduously labour to introduce Discipline, Harmony and Economy, into that part of the Army committed to my immediate Care; that as I am the Officer of the united States, I shall make no Colonial Discriminations and deprecate every Measure that has the least Tendency to disunite or create Jealousies amongst us.  Permit me to suggest that I think one or two Troops of Horse may be speedily levied and accoutered in the Vicinity of Albany, and I believe much cheaper than in this part of the Country, that they would be very useful, and that if Congress should see Cause to order it to be done I could wish for their Direction in the Arrangement. Messrs. Winslow and Pierce the Deputy paymasters general in the Northern Department have made a written application to me requesting me to represent to Congress that their pay is small, and intreating an augmentation of it. Capt. Stevens also of the artillery has intreated me to advise Congress, that he last Year held the Rank of Major, but that on the new Arrangement he stands as a Captain only. He is a worthy officer and I believe would promote the Service if he was honored with a Brevet giving him the Rank of Major.  None of the officers of Colonel Livingston's Regiment, except Captain Hughes, have as yet received their Commissions. I wish to know if it is the pleasure of Congress that I should fill up the Commissions agreeable to the List I had the Honor to transmit to Congress.  Permit me, with all due Deference to the better Judgment of Congress, to suggest that the Mode of paying the army by abstract may be attended with some abuses, and that I should be extremely happy if I might be permitted to direct the pay-Masters in the Northern Department to conduct themselves in the Line pointed out by the orders of the 8h of February last, Copy whereof I had the Honor to enclose, which, with some small amendments, I should hope would effectually remedy the Evils, so much and so fully complained of.  If General Gates should not have appointed a Deputy Adjutant General and Deputy Judge advocate I should wish to be empowered to make temporary appointments until the pleasure of Congres was known.  As the Indians frequently inform me of certain Matters, said by them to be done or promised by the Commissioners of the middle Department, which Causes some Embarrassment in giving answers to them, I therefore wish that the Committee of Indian affairs may be directed from Time to Time to furnish the Commissioners with Copies of such Intelligence as may be received by Congress.(1)  I propose leaving this to Morrow, if agreeable to Congress, and beg  their Commands. I am Sir, with every Sentiment of Respect & Esteem, Your most obedient and most humble Servant, Ph. Schuyler  ""

  Honored Sir Philadelphia May 26th 1777 I was honored with your favour of the 18th Instant which I received on the 24th after Congress adjourned. I have not Seen Mr. Duer Since, but I never heard from him or any other person any Such imputation on any member of Assembly as your Honr. mentions. I Shall enquire into the matter.(1)  I transmitted Your Honr a copy of the resolution of Congress concerning the two Battalions to be Stationed in Connecticut in my last.(2)  The Board of War has Sent orders to the Commissary of Military Stores at Springfield to Supply the Connecticut Troops with Arms and Accoutrements upon Authentic Muster rolls being produced to him. As to the Field pieces and other Stores for the use of the State General Washington is best able to determine whether they can be Spared. By the best accounts from New York the Enemy paid pretty dear for their excursion to Danbury, tis reported here that Governor Tryon is dead of his wounds. I imagine they wont be fond of making another incursion into Connecticut unless they could have Some greater object in view than any that I know of, however it is best to be prepared for them.  Tis most likely they will pursue the plan of joyning their two arrnies by the way of Hudson's River if they have a Sufficient force. At present our Army in New Jersy is Superior to theirs. Some capital Stroke may be Struck there Soon. We have no great expectation of their coming to this City.  General Schuyler is here. Congress has ordered him to the Northern department. The Eastern States were of opinion that it would best promote the Service, for him to have been with the Commander in Chief, & that would probably have been carried if Rhode Island had been represented. Some are apprehensive that his taking Command in the Northern department may interfere with General Gates's plans and be prejudicial to the Service at a time when the Campaign is expected to be opened.  The Commissary General is here. Congress is about to make Some new regulations in that department.(3)  A Committee is appointed to consider what Honors are due to the MAY 26, 1777  memory of General Wooster. Major General Arnold is here. Congress has ordered an elegant horse properly caparisoned to be presented to him.  I am with great Esteem & Regard, Your Honrs. Obedient humble Servant, Roger Sherman  P.S I Saw an account in the New Haven paper that one Griswold was executed as a traitor and Spy by the Sentence of a Court Martial.(4) If he was an Inhabitant of the State & not of the Army, I think he ought to have been tryed before the Superior Court. The resolution of Congress for the punishment of Spies respects only persons who are not inhabitants of any of the United States, or under the protection of their laws. We cant be too careful of Military incroachments. It is easy to accuse any person with being a Spy & So put his Life in the power of a Court Martial if that is allowed. The Case of Molesworth who was tryed and executed in this City was approved by Congress, but it was from necessity, because there was no Civil Courts established in this State.(5) R.S.  ""

  Dr. Papa 27th May 1777 Pha. There is nothing new Since my last. I have yours of the 20th instant from Annapolis. Altho' the law making the currencies a legal tender is certainly unjust, yet when the debtors tender no more than the interest, I would not write to them about the injustice of tendering the interest money at par. When they tender more than the interest, it would be proper to expostulate with them on the injustice of the preferred payt. You say Lewellen's Son did not tender the money. I wish you may not bring yourself into trouble about that law, altho it is unjust, it hath passed, & we must submit to it, or take the consequences of a refusal. The Congress is under a necessity of emitting 5 million more of Dollars. We are in hopes we shall not be obliged to put this whole Sum in circulation, as the Loan offices & lottery will supply us with nearly money sufficient to answer the remaining expences of this campaign.  MAY 27, 1777  I am in hopes we shall be able to negotiate a loan in Europe among those nations which are diposed to favour our cause. If this could be done to any considerable extent, it would supersede the necessity of any farther emissions; and if the several States would tax highly, those taxes together with the monies that might be borrowed on interest, would probably nearly answer the expences of next campaign, which I think will not be so expensive as the present, as our army & its different departments will be put on a more economical footing.  This State is in a very languid condition. The Govt. is feeble beyond conception, & yet a better, I fear, will not soon be established; nothing but an actual invasion can make Pena. exert itself with becoming vigour. It has great resources, but in the present State of things they lie dormant; a collection of blankets is now making from the Quakers. They refused to give voluntarily even on payt. so that a Seeming force has become necessary to procure that much wanted supply. I shall write again by next Saturday's post, if there should be anything worth writing. All is quiet in the Jersies. Wishing you a long continuance of your health I remain, yr. affectionate Son,  C.

  My dear Sir, May 28th 1777 You have been undoubtedly surpris'd at my long Silence, but when I inform you what is Fact, that my principal Reasons for not writing have been want of Time, and of Satisfactory Matter, I flatter myself I shall Stand acquitted (if not with honor) at least as a Wilful Offender against the Laws of Friendship.  As General Schuyler expects to deliver this Letter in Person I shall refer you to him for the particular Manavres respecting his own affairs, and for the political Complexion of Affairs in Congress. From a very low Ebb at which our Affairs were when we arrived here we have recovered surprisingly and I may venture to say that the Eyes of all those who are not willfully blind are open, and that we may expect Justice to take Place with respect to our State.  I congratulate you on the Completion of the Task of forming and Organizing our New Government.(1) I think it upon the maturest Reflection the best System which has as yet been adopted, and possibly as good as the Temper of the Times would admit of. If it is well administerd, and some wise and Vigorous Laws pass'd at the Opening of the Session for watching, and defeating the Machinations of the Enemy & their Abettors, and for Supporting by Taxes, and other Means the Credit of the Circulating Money-it will be a formidable Engine of Opposition to the Designs of our Tyrannical Enemies-but I assure you I am not without my Fears concerning the Choice which will be made of those who are to set the Machine in Motion.  Our All Depends on it. It is very observable that in almost every other State where Government has been formd, and established either from the Contention of Parties, or from a Want of proper Power being vested in the Executive Branches-Disaffection has encreased prodigiously, and an unhappy langour has prevaild in the whole Political System. I sincerely wish that this may not be the Case with us, but that the new Government may continue to act with that Spirit, Integrity, and Wisdom which animated the Councils of the Old!  In this State Toryism (or rather Treason) stalks triumphant, the Credit of our Money is sapp'd by the Arts and Avarice of the Malignants and Monopolisers, and such is the desperate Situation of affairs, that nothing but desperate Remedies can restore these people to Reason and Virtue.  The Assembly is now convend, but I am afraid will not dare to lay a Tax to call in part of the large Sums of Money circulating in this State, or to pass vigorous Laws to crush the disaffected. All my hope is that the Spirit of Whiggism will at length break forth in some of the Populace, which (if well directed) may effect by Quackery a  MAY 28, 1777  Course which the regular State Physicians are either not adequate to, or unwilling to attempt.  A Spirit of this kind under the Name of Joyce Junr. has made his Appearance in Boston.(2) I should not be surpris'd if he was to travel Westward. It would be attended with these good Effects: it would either supply the Want of Vigor in the present Government or it would induce those whose duty it is to act with Spirit and Vigor. What think you of an Episcopalian Clergyman in this City praying last Sunday for the Lords Spiritual and Temporal-or rather what think you of the Congregation which heard him with Patience?  If in the midst of your Political Business you can now and then drop me a Line I will esteem it as a favor, and (if not regularly) I will by Starts when there is any thing worth communicating write to you.  A Word in the Ear of a Friend. When I was sent here I had some Idea that I was entering into The Temple of Public Virtue. I am disappointed and Chagrined. Genl. Schuyler will communicate my Sentiments and his own at large.  The Chaste Colo. Lee will I am credibly informed be left out of the new Delegation for Virginia which is now in Agitation. The mere Contemplation of this Event gives me Pleasure. My mind is full, and I wish to unburthen it; but Prudence forbids me.(3)  I condole with you on the Loss of your Aged Mother or rather should I not congratulate you that she is arrived in a secure and pleasant Haven from a Storm, which she was little calculated to bear? This Reflection I beleive has alleviated your Distress. May we be as Virtuous as your Parents should we live to be as old! From the rapid Increase of Villainy both Moral and Political, it is to be feard that we shall not increase in Virtue, as we may in Years. Remember me to all my Freinds, particularly to my Fellow-Labourors in the Council of Conspiracy.(4) Adieu, and beleive me Yours with much Esteem and Affection. W Duer  [P.S.] I have deliverd Genl. Schuyler a Letter from your Friend Mr Dean in France.(5) I have had it some Time by me, but waited a safe Mode of Conveyance.  ""

  My dear Friend, 28 May 1777 Like an old Sinner who has deferr'd Repentance, I should almost be afraid to write to you after so long a Silence, if I did not trust that your Lenity would be a powerful Advocate in my favor, more particularly when I can with Truth assure you that my attention has been so engross'd in defeating the Designs of a Mischevious Combination, and in cultivating the Friendship of the Members from the Southern States that I have had little or no Time to write to you as fully as I have wishd.  I have now the Pleasure to inform you that in Spite of all the Arts and Influence made use of by the Eastern Delegates in conjunction with the Members from New Jersey-we have got Genl. Schuyler's Conduct fully justified, and himself reinstated in his Command in the Northern Department in as extensive a Manner as before. There was never I believe a more Difficult Card to play. Genl. Gates had the Address whilst at this Place to insinuate himself into the good Graces of even the honest Part of the House, and the wickedness to poison the Minds of most with Prejudices against Genl. Schuyler, which operated so strongly that nothing but Time and great Temper and address could have dispelled the Mist of Error which had clouded the Eyes even of those who were Friends to the great Cause, and to the State of New York.  His own merit however which they have had an opportunity of seeing, and the all powerful Influence of Truth assisted with Management at length effected all our wishes and we carried the Question upon his being reinstated in his Command in the Northern Department in the following manner.  Affirmative Negative New York New Hampshire Delaware Pensilvania Massachusetts Rhode Island Maryland Connecticut. not represented. Virginia __________ North Carolina Jersey; and South Carolina Georgia divided. Dissentient from Virginia Richard Henry Lee.(1)  MAY 28, 1777  This Division will give you a pretty good general Idea of the political Complexion of the different States. But I must inform you that the Vote of Virginia is rather a Phenomenon, and that the Division of Jersey was owing to the Absence of Mr. Clark, and Mr. Sargent whose political Line of Conduct lies to the Eastward of Biram's River.(2) Genl. Schuyler will inform you more fully on this Subject.  We shall now have Leisure to pay our Attention to the Matters recommended to us by the Convention and ( to make use of Lord Botetourt's Expression) I augur well of the Event of our Exertions. This you may be assurd of that we have recover'd a full Weight in the Scale of Politicks in this Place.  You will be as sorry to hear, as I am to inform you that a langour of the most alarming Nature prevails in this City and State-principally (from what I can judge) to be imputed to the Dispute about their Government, which rages with more Violence than ever. This City is a Vortex which sucks in the Disaffected, and monopolisers of all the Different States, by whose Acts and Traffic the Continental Money is depocketed far beyond what can possibly be imputed to the Quantity emitted. Unless some Wise and Vigorous Measures are speedily adopted for checking this Evil, I tremble for the Consequences. I entertain no doubt from a Variety of Circumstances but that the Main Plot of the Enemy is to war against the Credit of our Money.  At present unhappily for us they have too fair a Prospect of succeeding. You would be astonished, my dear Freind, at the Lukewarmness shewn by them both in and out of Congress who denominate themselves Whigs on this Subject-for my own Part I feel an Anxiety on the Occasion, which I have never experienced at any Period of this Contest, and so far as the Influence or Attention of an Individual can avail I am determind to exert myself in this important Matter. You will do essential Service to the public, and oblige a Friend in communicating your Ideas on the Means of recovering the Credit of our Money, and establishing Funds for the future Operations of the war. The sooner I can be furnished with your Thoughts the better as I [am] on a Committee for the last mentioned Purpose.(3)  My long Absence from my Private Affairs has thrown them into such Confusion that I cannot without almost ruining myself irreparably be absent from home much longer. I apply by this Opportunity to the Council of Safety for permission to be absent about a Month or 6 weeks, and that Mr. Morris may be orderd to attend.(4) I am very happy that he is returnd; he will do honor and essential Service to the State.  If I obtain Leave of absence, in which I sollicit your Influence, I shall do myself the Pleasure of spending some Days at Claremont. I  entreat you to remember me in the most affectionate Manner to all under your Roof, and to beleive me, very Sincerely, Yours, W Duer  [P.S.] As I write in hurry, you must excuse my Incorrectness, and the Heiroglyphics I make use of.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia 28th May 1777 Your favor of the 9th inst came to hand Yesterday.(1) I am extreamly sorry you shod be under the necessaty of filling up the Regiments with eight & twelve months men as it appears to me there will always be a difficulty in replacing them. I can conceive of no reason for an abatement in the spirits of the People unless it is that those miscreants who are at the distruction of their Country, are not treated with that just severity which their Crimes deserve. What purpose will it answer to fill the Goals? These Villains have all friend, & while they remain with you 'tho they are in Goal they will be raising their parties, whereas if they are under Ground or out of the Country they will soon be forgot. The necessaty of the Case will surely justify the most severe &decisive measures, I am always for persueing lenitive measures, when such will answer the purpose, but experience has tought us others must be adopted. I am fully sensible of the necessaty you are under of a supply of Military stores & shall do everything in My power to obtain them.  I wish to know what Concurrent circomstances leed you to apprehend a speedy attackt. The Enemy certainly have no troops to spare from N. York; nor can they have a considerable reinforcement from Europe very soon, however there is no doubt its best to be prepared at all points for which purpose the most Vigorous exertions shod be use'd. It will by no means do to dispond because a few scatering Clouds pass between us & the sun, proper Exertion will soon dispel them. We shod never suffer Gloomy reflections to incomber the path, but look forward MAY 28, 1777  to the Glorious prize, with a determination to obtain it, and all those difficulties that a Gloomy mind wod deem insupportable will be meer mushroons. As we get over difficulties no doubt new one will start up, but Pacience, & Vigorous persevereince will surmount them all. I wish I had some good news to send you to Chear you up, however I hope to bring you some shortly as I shall leave this so soon as I can get some necessary matters settled in Naval department, which (to my Grief) is not on so respectable a footing as I coud wish.  Our army is daily increasing. There is a report that a Lieut Col Walcot was kill'd on the retreat of the Enemy from Denbury, & that Govr, alias Major Genl. Tryon who commanded that notable Expedition, is dead of the wounds he receiv'd there.  I shod send you some new papers but have none by me & as the post hour is arriv'd have not time to send for any, must therefore bid you Adieu after assuring you that I am Sincerely Your Friend &c  Wm.

  Friends and fellow Citizens [ante May 29, 1777](1) We your Delegates in Congress address you at this Period in order to give you a Just Notion of your affairs and of the Exertions Necessary for compleating your Freedom and Happiness.  Our Enemy are unwearied in their Endeavours to seduce you from that honest and virtuous firmness wherewith you have united against their Usurpations. They pretend that your resistance do's not arise from a Sense of Violence done to your Rights, but from a Delusion into which you have been lead by Some designing men whose purpose is only to set up an Independant Dominion that they themselves may enjoy the supreme Power.  These Suggestions your own Experience can best refute, to you it is best known that they are false and Groundless, and every honest unprejudiced man will be convinced of it from a short View of the progress of the Contest.  The British Parliament expressly declared that they had and of Right ought to have Power to bind the Inhabitants of America in all Cases whatsoever. They proceeded to the Exercise of such Power by laying Taxes to be paid in America, and they Instituted arbitrary Courts supported by Military Force to Compel Obedience. This Tax,  MAY 29, 1777  confessedly, was not laid for the Value of the revenue, but to form a precedent for exercising the Power when and to what Extent they pleased.  The Representatives of the People in their general Assemblies Complained of those Doings as violating the Rights of their Constituents. They knew it was their distinguished Privilege to give and grant their own Money, and to Consent to all Laws which they were bound to obey.  Soon as the Governors perceived the Assemblies were in Deliberation on this Subject they dissolved them. Other Representatives were chozen and those Extravagant Usurpations Still presented themselves as the greatest Grievance. When they entered on the Consideration of them they were again dissolved. This mode was pursued until the People every where became Sensible that no Opportunity would be given them ever to Complain. Necessity pointed out to them that they must have recourse to other Methods of representing their wrongs and requiring redress. Nature pointed out to them the mode they Adopted, and they were so reluctant to do any thing which might even appear a Deviation from Established Form, that they long forbore assembling in Towns and Counties and did not at length yield to the Necessity until they found every hope of redress any other way was lost.  When obliged to take this first Step the People proceeded with the utmost Caution. No tumult or disorder appeared, every man was impressed with an awful Sense of the Necessity he was under of Exercising that Right which Nature gave to every Man, and which the British Constitution expressly Assented, that of Consulting and resolving Concerning his Safety and Happiness, and each was determined to Exercise it no farther than the Necessity pressingly required.  In the most humble manner they declared their attachment to the Established Government, and even affection to the person of the Prince, they Complained of Wrongs which they modestly supposed to have arisen from no ill Intention or design in the Prince or Parliament, and they determined to Communicate their Sentiments to their Neighbors in Conventions of representatives Chozen and Instructed for this purpose. The same Necessity pressing at the Same time in every Colony, the same Sense of Wrong being every where felt, and Simple Nature every where Suggesting the same Expedient the meetings were every where held nearly at the same time, and they produced Conventions nearly at the Same time in every one of the present United States. Instructions from the People were nearly the Same in every Town and County, and they all Breathed (nearly) the same Spirit of humility, Moderation and Loyalty. All pointed out the Propriety of a Common Communication between the Different Colonies, and of Joint Supplications to the Throne for redress of Wrongs and Protection from Usurpations.  This produced the first Congress, and that Congress Confined itself entirely to Stating the Grievances of the People of America, Peti[ti]oning the King for a redress of them, professing the most Loyal humility and recommending Frugality and A Suspension of Commerce, unless within a Certain time the Wrongs should be redressed.  It is fresh in every Ones Memory that their Petition was treated with the most Insulting Contempt. That another Congress Still fondly holding by the Hope that Britain would forego her unjust Claims and Harmony be Restored, most humbly entreated the King to point out Some Method by which the Complaints of America might find their way to him without offending him, but to this Petition, the lowest Condescention to which a free People ever Stooped, was refused even an Answer. This humiliating Measure which Nothing but the Extream reluctance of the People of America to seperate from Britain can Account for or Justify was as fruitless as every other, and Acts of Parliament were made to subject the persons and Properties of Americans every where to Military plunder and Execution. Regular Bands of Soldiers were marched into the Country under their officers to deal Hostile Murders and Ravages around them. A formidable Naval Force was employed to hinder the Commerce of populous Cities and thereby to reduce the poor Inhabitants to Wretchedness, and even to prevent their availing themselves of the Food which the Sea Washing their own Coasts afforded to their Industry-and it was expressly declared that no Mitigation of those violences could be obtained but by Submitting without Condition to the absolute Will of the Parliament of Great Britain, a Body composed of men unknown to and unchozen by the Inhabitants of America, and who showed but too little regard to the Rights of their own Constituents, and of human Nature.  The Conduct of the British Court towards the Americans in the repeated dissolutions of their Assemblies whenever they attempted to Complain, in disregarding their Complaints when offered in the most humble and supplicating Manner by their Representatives in Congress, in refusing even to point out a Mode whereby they might find an Inoffensive passage to the Royal Ear, in disregarding all Rules of Justice and humanity by Subjecting their persons and Properties to Military Violence and Endeavouring even to Starve them, and by denying any Mitigation of those Enormities, Unless absolute Submission Should be made. this Conduct of the B[ritish] C[ourt] left no room to doubt that they considered the Americans as objects merely of Dominion not of Government. of Plunder not of Protection, of Military Tyranny not of Legal administration of Justice. No choice was left but to Oppose Arms to Arms, or submit to the absolute dominion of Men whose pride and Cruelty is incurrable, and whose rapacity is without Bounds. No alternative was left to the Citizen but to rouse into a Soldier or Sink into a Slave and entail Servitude Irrevocably on his posterity.   Yet even after this altho the People of America Could not Hesitate to take Arms, they kept in view their much loved Constitutional Connection with Britain, and altho they knew that when Protection was denied them, and they were driven to arms for their Safety, all relation between them and the Crown of Britain was dissolved, yet they chose to overlook this, and so long as any Hope remained of obtaining it on Just and reasonable Grounds to leave every possible Avenue open to reconciliation, nor did they forego this pleasing tho Imaginary prospect until they four.d that Britain was arming Slaves, Savages, and foreign Mercenaries against them and that she was totally regardless of their sufferings and Intent only on Subduing them to absolute Slavery. It now became Folly to indulge any Hope of Reconciliation. The Americans were universally Sensible that in all her progress Britain was determined to Establish over them an unlimitted Tyranny, that nothing less would Satisfy her ambition, and to Effect this She would Not Scruple to Expose them to the Undistinguishing Plunder and Massacres of Slaves, Indians, and more unfeeling Mercenary Soldiers. All Connection with Britain became impossible Except as Slaves without Right or property, but what must be held at the Precarious Will and pleasure of her Ministers.(2) Reconciliation became the same thing as Slavery, Independence the same thing as Freedom. Independance was not the voluntary choice of America but the Alternative which she prefered to Servitude, for no other Choice but one of them was left.  Every Man in America knows that during the whole Progress until the Declaration of Independance Britain might have disarmed America and made her perfectly Happy by recalling her Fleets and armies, renouncing her claims to absolute Dominion and declaring she would be Satisfied with regulating Commerce. That the Declaration of Independance was adopted at length as a Measure of Necessity to which Britain herself had driven America, and every Man of Common Sense and Honesty must be convinced it is Necessary to maintain it. Because to give it up would be to Sink into the most abject Slavery to a People who have given the most convincing Proofs that they regard us only as objects of their rapine; whose Policy it must be to keep us always poor, dejected and oppressed in order to Subdue our Spirit of Resistance to their Tyranny and to blot out even the Memory of that Liberty which Animates us at present to defend our Rights under so many disadvantagesw Even to suspend it would deprive us of the Confidence of Foreign Powers, and Consequently of their Friendship and assistance. Thus Britain could she prevail in this would deprive us of every prospect of Support and might pursue her purpose of enslaving us without danger of any Effectual resistance, and we should be deprived of every resource which enables us to make a stand for our Liberties.  In short it is manifest that from the Begining Britain has pursued a purpose of making the People of America Submit to her absolute  Dominion, and regardless of Right, Justice and humanity, has employed means the most destructive and Calamitous.  On the other Hand America has Supplicated with the most humble Voice and manner of Complaint, have prayed with most Submissive humility for Peace, Liberty and Safety, but in vain, and at length when forced to take Arms for self-preservation She raised them with reluctance against Britain even in Defence of her own Bosom, and at length unwillingly seperated altho she plainly saw that any further Connection must involve her in Circumstances worse than utter Perdition.  To maintain this Seperation is to maintain the Religion, Liberty and Property of ourselves and our Posterity, to renounce it is to Sink into the lowest meanness and Slavery.  May God remove every such thought from every American Breast! Welcome first the Life of the most uncivilized Savages ! Welcome Death itself and everlasting Oblivion to our race!  Your own Experience, Fellow Citizens, will best bear Testimony to the Truth of the Facts here set forth. Your own Experience can best prove the Falshood of the Suggestion that you are deluded by Individuals who aim at Nothing but Power. You know how little Influence Individuals have over you. You know that every Man trusted or Employed by you is a creature of your free Choice, and by every choice you make and every act you do you manifest that you feel you are Sovereign and supreme, and Influenced by Nothing but a Conviction that you ought to be free, a Determined Resolution to remain so and to transmit freedom unimpaired to your Children. You well know that you Command Your Servants to Execute Certain Duties which tho arduous and dangerous they think they ought not to refuse because every Citizen is devoted to his Country, and ought Serve on such Duty as his Country shall think proper to require.  It is not Strange that our Enemies should have fallen at first into this Error, accustomed to a Country where only the Shadow of Liberty remains to the People, where Multitudes know no more of freedom than the Liberty of following their choice of leaders, where the most groce [gross] and wicked artifices are every day practized in order to acquire Power and trust to Individuals who afterwards abuse them, to the purposes of avarice and Luxury, where the People in short are Considered as fit for Nothing but to toil that men of high birth and Fortune may (riot on what) live in Ease and Splender.. Accustomed to this it is not surprising they should expect to find the Same in America. They know not the Plenty which the fruitful Soil of America yields to the Hand which gives it Cultivation, that penury and oppressive Landlords are here equally unknown, that Americans undebauched by Luxury have few wants and these few are always supply'd by a chearful and Laborious Industry, that wanting nothing they have nothing to   Hope from Individuals, and no Individuals having Power or Inclination to hurt they have nothing from Individuals to fear. That each man has Leisure to Search out and understand what are his rights and that none Can Comprehend any reason why they should be given up to the absolute will of another. In Such a state as this no One is in a Situation to delude or be deluded, and the People of America well know that it is their State, altho of such the present race of Men in Britain have no Experience. But it is not to be believed that they Still Continue in this Error. They have Seen the People change their Servants frequently since they were compelled to take arms for their Defence, and yet the resistance has rather increased upon every change. They have seen the People in every State Erect Governments by their Sovereign authority, and in these Governments take special care that no Individuals should ever acquire any Influence over them. They have met with one Common Spirit of resistance every where in America, and that Spirit actuated the People without Distinction. This must undoubtedly have Convinced them long before this that the Americans are all apprehensive of Danger from the same Object and are Influenced by nothing but that Common Apprehension, and a firm resolution to meet it with Effectual Opposition.  But altho they cannot believe it they make use of it as an Engine wherewith to deceive the timorous and unwary amongst us. They put it as an argument into the mouths of their Emissaries, and Such Inhabitants of America, as are insensible of the Blessings of Freedom, Such as are unfeeling and mean spirited enough to prefer their present ease and oppulence to the Happiness of Milions now living and of Myriads yet unborn, Such as have wickedly determined for the Hopes of private advantages to assist in enslaving the Country which gave them birth, or Support, or altered them by the pleasing prospect of Liberty and plenty, Such endeavour to avail themselves of it, to excuse their Indolence, their selfishness or their Criminal Endeavours.(3) We flatter ourselves their are few of our fellow Citizens who answer this description, but we are sorry to find there are Some, and we warn you against all who use these arguments to you. Every Man who uses them is himself convinced of their falshood, and every Man to whom they are used need but apply one moment to his own Experience to refute them. We advise you therefore to Consider all such as men who wish you to Submit to the absolute Will of a People whose rapine as appears by their Treatment of Ireland and the East Indies can never be Satisfied, as long as the most Cruel Violence can Extort any thing from you.(4)  The War in which we are engaged for the defence of the Liberty Religion, and property of ourselves and our Posterity was begun under every disadvantage which a brave and virtuous People could struggle with. A powerfull and warlike oppressor whose Numbers of Inhabitants and boundless Commerce render her resources infinite and inex-  haustable, with armies disciplined and officers Experienced, with a Fleet in every respect the Dread and Envy of the World on our part Inexperience, (went of Numbers,) want of Commerce, of warlike stores and even of (arms), and of every resource but an Inextinguishable Love of Liberty and a Confidence in the Justice of Divine Providence. In this Situation were we opposed to that Power which a few years ago Shook the most formidable Monarchies in Europe and carried Terror all over the World, (and who ungenerously as well as unjustly relying on her Superior Force insisted on binding us in all Cases whatever without our Consent, and on binding us to an absolute Submission to the Will and pleasure of her Corrupt and venal Ministers). Not detered by such Disadvantages, nor despairing of Divine aid and Protection the Virtuous Inhabitants of America determined (without Hesitation) to resist all attempts to enforce such unjust and extravagant Claims, and to maintain that Freedom which Heaven had originally bestowed on Mankind, and which their Ancestors had wrested from the Hands of usurping Tyrants, and rendering it more valuable by their Blood shed in its defence transmitted Improved to their Posterity, chusing rather to trust to the Issue of any War however callamitous, than to the boundless and Insatiable rapine of Ministers who had a whole People once great and Free to corrupt, and Consequently Innumerable Minions to employ, whose avarice or Luxury must be Satiated with the plunder extorted from the Industrious Poor in America. The Events of the War hitherto have justified our Trust in Divine Providence, and prove to us that an all wise and beneficent God will never forsake men who have virtue enough to Struggle for those Blessings which he has bestowed upon them, and who will rely on his Protection against all superiority of worldly Power, for, our unfeeling Enemy, tho possessed of the advantages of superior Force, Discipline and Experience, and employing every Engine of Fraud and violence in a three years War have acquired only one City and a small Teritory round it which by reason of their superiority in shipping could not be defended and they have been baffled in every (Considerable Enterprize) attempt to Penetrate into the Country whether from Canada or the Sea. They have been forced to fly from Boston, and have been repelled and defeated with disgrace at Charlestown, and their Efforts against Virginia, North and South Carolina, either by Invasion from the Sea, by Inroads which they procured the Savage Indians to make on Western Frontiers or the Insurrections Excited by them among the Slaves, the Ignorant Highlanders, and disaffected Tories have been all repelled and suppressed, with little Damage to us; but with Irreparable Ruin to their Instruments. Their attempts against Pennsylvania were rendered abortive, their Troops defeated, and Captivated, and their Generals forced to retreat in order to save the remains of their army from utter destruction, altho this Enterprize was undertaken under the Conduct of their   most experienced officers, with a numerous, well disciplined and well appointed army at a time when we had but few Troops, and these Few under every disadvantage. This Happy event was produced by the Superior Skill and Sagacity of our Commander in Chief, by the Indefatigable perseverance and Intrepidity of our fellow Citizens who composed the army under his Command great part of which consisted of the Militia of Philadelphia, and other parts of Pennsylvania, Jersey and Maryland, and above all by the peculiar Interposition of Divine Providence. Ever Since they have been confined to Straight Quarter and never attempted to pass without them but they are repulsed defeated or taken Prisoners.  The Campaign is now nearly ready to open. We have large Supplies of Arms and Military Stores, we have large Magazines of Provisions, and our Country abounds in plenty, for among other marks of Divine favor Heaven has blessed us with Extraordinary fruitfulness. Your Delegates in Congress have provided a liberal, and they Hope useful Establishment for the assistance and care of all who during the Course of the War may be afflicted with Wounds or diseases and are taking every precaution to preserve the Health of their fellow Citizens who must form the armies. Nothing is now wanting but the Zealous Exertions of our brave fellow Citizens to Compleat our armies, and to man our Navy, and to watch, detect, and suppress the Tories amongst us with Spirit and Vigilence.  For these purpose[s] we Exhort you every where to use every Effort for recruiting the Battalions from our brave and Magnanimous Youth, to whom must be due the Glory of Freeing their Country from Oppression, and bestowing Liberty and Happiness on their Families to be transmitted to future ages in a bright and improving Succession, to Apprehend all Deserters who not only disgrace themselves by quitting so Noble a Conflict, but Rob you of the Monies which have been advanced to them, to Seize and bring to legal punishment all who Endeavour to deceive any men into a Belief that they ought to Submit to the absolute Dominion of Britain or to renounce that Independance which alone can Secure us from it, in a Word to Employ the most vigorous and Zealous Vigilence in Executing the Laws Enacted by every State upon Offenders against the public cause. We have the Strongest Confidence that the men You entrust with the Power of making Laws will provide such as will be Competent to every desirable purpose, and we assure you that we shall not remit the greatest care, attention and Vigor in discharging the Duties you have Enjoyned us to perform.(5)  May the all bountiful, Merciful, and Gracious God enable us to Conclude the War in a short time, and with as little Misery to Mankind as possible, and so may he prosper our Endeavours as he knows our Intentions are void of ambition, and of every Motive but that of  Securing those Blessings which we derive from him as the Great and bountiful Father of Mankind. We hope Fellow Citizens that your Virtue and Piety will always merit his Divine Protection, and we humbly beseech him to make you the Care of his All righteous Providence.  ""

  Philadelphia May 30th. 1777 We have delayed sending this Packet from a daily expectation of hearing from you, as some letters from France make mention of a quick sailing Vessel by [which] we were to receive despatches. Tho' it must be agreeable to you to hear frequently from us, yet as our letters by being taken might be of worse Consequence than being delayed, We are desirous of waiting for the safest opportunity, and when you hear not so often as you wish; remember, our Silence means our Safety. Acquainted as we are with the Situation and Condition of the Enemy, we well know, that the pompous Paragraphs in the London papers, are not the News which the Ministry hear from their Army but the News they make for them.  The Amphitrite is safely arrived at Portsmouth N. Hampshire. The Seine at Martinique, but is made a Prize of on her Passage from thence. We request you to expedite the Loan of Two Millions (which we have MAY 30, 1777  already sent you a commission for and now send you a duplicate of the same) for tho' we conceive the Credit of America to be as well founded at least as any in the world, having neither Debt nor Taxes on her Back when she began the War, yet she represents a Man who with a Vast Capital all in Property is unable to make new Purchases till he can either convert some of it into Specie, or borrow from hand to mouth in the mean Time. Britain is now fighting us, and the Greatest part of Europe negatively, by endeavouring to stop that Trade from us, to France, Spain &c which She has most effectually lost to herself, & we wish those Courts saw their Interest in the same Clear point of View, which it appears to us. We have little or no doubt of being able to reduce the Enemy by Land and we likewise believe that the united Powers of France, Spain and America would be able totally to expel the British fleet from the western Seas, by which the Communication for Trade would be openned, the Number of Interests reduced which have hitherto distracted the West Indies, and Consequently the Peace of all this Side the Globe put on a better foundation than it has yet ever been a Mutual Advantage as we Conceive to France, Spain and these States.  That Britain was formidable in the West Indies last War is true, but when it is Considered that her power there arose from her Possessions here or that she was formidable chiefly thro' us it is impossible to suppose that she can again arrive to the same pitch. Here she was assisted by Numberless Privateers-Here she supplied and partly manned her Navy, recruited and almost raised her Army for that service, in short, America last War represented Britain removed to this side the Atlantic. The scene is changed, and America now, is that to France and Spain, in point of Advantage, which she last War was to Britain. Therefore putting the Convenience which we might receive out of the Question, by their making an Attack on the West Indies, We are somewhat surprised that such Political Courts as France and Spain should Hesitate on a Measure so alluring and Practicable. We do not mention these Remarks because we suppose they do not occur to you, but to let you know our thoughts on the matter, and to give you every advantage by conveying our minds to you as well as our Instructions or Informations.

  May 31st. [1777] Since the above, the events of war have not been considerable. The Enemy, with about 2000 Men from N. York pushed up the Sound by water, and made a forced March thro a small part of Connecticut to surprise & destroy a Magazine of provisions laid up there for our Army. They succeeded in destroying about 1700 barrels of Salted Meat & some grain, with about 1000 barrels of flour. However, the Militia assembled quickly as possible under command of Generals Wooster & Arnold to the number of about 1500 and attacked the enemy as they were retreating to their Ships where with great difficulty, and much loss, they at length arrived. We learn that this trip has lessened their numbers at least 500. Among the wounded and since dead we are told they count Majr. General Govern. Tryon and a Colonel Wolcot. The loss of provisions has been amply made up to us by the Privateers who have taken 5000 barrels of Salted provisions coming to N. York from  MAY 31, 1777  Europe. In a variety of skirmishes lately we have beaten them, and in some of these, their best Troops have been foiled. By this opportunity Congress sends you a particular Commission as their Representative at the Court of Spain.(1) In my judgement, and it is an opinion founded on the most accurate information, the Independence, and security of N. America, cannot be said to be certain until an Alliance with Spain & France is procured, and in consequence, the British Arms, and Arts not solely employed for our ruin. You may be assured that this is of infinite consequence to your Country and therefore you will conduct yourself accordingly. And for the assistance of our finance, an extensive loan is indispensable. If any untoward accident should have befallen our brother the alderman, in which case I have desired my letters to him to be sent you for your perusal, the management of my boys must rest entirely with you and in that case, at all events, you will see the necessity of sending them both immediately to me.  Farewell my dear Brother. Richard Henry Lee  P.S. It will be of great consequence that I hear from you frequently & fully. If your letters come anywhere to the Northward of Virginia, or if they go by the West Indies, let them be directed to the care of our brother Doctor Shippen in Philadelphia. R.H.L.

  Sir, Philada.31st May, 1777. We transmit you the resolution of Congress, of 23rd May, 1777, relative to the manning and fitting out two galleys for the defence of the North river.(1) We wish that Mr. Morris who was desired by Convention to write on this subject, had transmitted his letter to the board of war through us, as we then should have been able (in all probability) to have obtained a resolution for fitting those gallies at the Continental ex- MAY 31, 1777  pense.(2) For want of previous information, the resolution enclosed was passed without that attention which might otherwise have been paid to it.  We by no means are of opinion that there is any similarity betwixt the State of New-York and other States who have fitted out vessels of this nature.  The use of these vessels in Hudson's river is chiefly to protect the chain near the forts in the Highlands, and by that means keep up the communication betwixt the southern and eastern States. In other States they have been built for the purpose of protecting their own harbours and towns. The purpose, therefore, for which the vessels on Hudson's river are intended, being Continental, the expense ought, in our opinion, to be the same.  If the Council of Safety should be of the same opinion with us, and write to Congress on this subject, we shall procure a reconsideration of this resolution, and exert ourselves to make the fitting and manning these vessels a Continental charge. In the mean time, we think it will be for the interest and safety of the State to exert themselves in equipping and manning these vessels with the utmost despatch.(3)  We are directed by Mr. Lewis to inform you that the accounts of the sloop Montgomery will be forwarded in two or three days, together with the share of prize money due to the captors.(4)  We are, sir, with great respect, Your obedt. hble. servts.  Phil Livingston, Wm. Duer.  P.S. Capt. Cook having no money to carry him out of town, we have furnished him with a loan of seventy dollars, for which we enclose you his receipt.  Reprinted from Journals of N.Y. Prov. Cong., 1:958. Addressed: \""To the Honble. Pierre Van Cortlandt, President of the Council of Safety of the State of New-York.\""  1 See JCC, 8: 383  2 Gouverneur Morris' May 13 letter to the Board of War requesting \""your Assistance in procuring Men for two Gallies in Hudson's River\"" is in PCC, item 78, 15:197.  3 In accordance with this advice, the council of safety wrote letters on June 17 to President Hancock and to the New York delegates, protesting Congress' failure to assume the cost of manning and outfitting the two galleys. However, the delegates decided to withhold these letters from Congress and not raise the issue of Continental financing because of their belief that Congress felt it had recently devoted too much of its time to New York affairs.

  Monday, June 2. 1777(1) Artillery Election! I wish I was at it, or near it.  Yours of the 18th reached me this Morning. The Cause that Letters are so long in travelling, is that there is but one Post in a Week who goes from hence to Peeks Kill, altho there are two that go from thence to Boston.  Riding every day, has made me better than I was, altho I am not yet quite well. I am determined to continue this Practice, which is very necessary for me.  I rejoice to find, that the Town have had the Wisdom to send but one Rep[resentative]. The House last Year was too numerous and unwieldy. The Expence was too great. I suppose you will have a Constitution formed this Year. Who will be the Moses, the Lycurgus, the Solon? Or have you a score or two of such? Whoever they may be and whatever Form may be adopted, I am perswaded there is among the Mass of our People a Fund of Wisdom, Integrity and Humanity, which will preserve their Happiness, in a tolerable Measure.  If the Enemy come to Boston again, fly with your little ones all of them to Philadelphia But they will scarcely get to Boston, this Campaign.  I admire your Sentiments concerning Revenge.  JUNE 2, 1777  Revenge, in ancient Days, you will see it through the whole Roman History, was esteemed a generous, and an heroic Passion. Nothing was too good for a Friend or too bad for an Enemy. Hatred and Malice, without Limits, against an Enemy, was indulged, was justified, and no Cruelty was thought unwarrantable.  Our Saviour taught the Immorality of Revenge, and the moral Duty of forgiving Injuries, and even the Duty of loving Enemies. Nothing can shew the amiable, the moral, and divine Excellency of these Christian Doctrines in a stronger Point of Light, than the Characters and Conduct of Marius and Sylla, Cazsar, Pompey, Anthony and Augustus, among innumerable others.  Retaliation, we must practice, in some Instances, in order to make our barbarous Foes respect in some degree the Rights of Humanity. But this will never be done without the most palpable Necessity.  The Apprehension of Retaliation alone, will restrain them from Cruelties which would disgrace Savages.  To omit it then would be cruelty to ourselves, our Officers and Men.  We are amused here with Reports of Troops removing from R. Island, N. York, Staten Island &c.-Waggons, Boats, Bridges &c. prepared-two old Indiamen cutt down into floating Batteries mounting 32 Guns sent round into Delaware R &c. &c. But I heed it no more, than the whistling of the Zephyrs. In short I had rather they should come to Philadelphia than not. It would purify this City of its Dross. Either the Furnace of Affliction would refine it of its Impurities, or it would be purged yet so as by fire.  This Town has been a dead Weight, upon Us-it would be a dead Weight also upon the Enemy. The Mules here would plague them more than all their Money.  ""

  Dear Sir. Phyladelphia June 2d. 1777 Yours of the 28 Ult. is before me.(1) It is certain that Religion and Morality have no less obligations upon Armies, than upon Cities and contribute no less to the Happiness of Soldiers than of Citizens. There is one Principle of Religion which has contributed vastly to the Excellence of Armies, who had very little else of Religion or Morality, the Principle I mean is the Sacred obligation of oaths, which among both Romans and Britans, who seem to have placed the whole of Religion and Morality in the punctual observance of them, have done Wonders.  JUNE 2, 1777  It is this alone which prevents Desertions from your Enemies. I think our Chaplains ought to make the Solemn Nature and the Sacred obligation of oaths the favourite Subject of their Sermons to the Soldiery. Odd as it may seem I cannot help considering a serious sense of the Solemnity of an oath as the corner Stone of Discipline, and that it might be made to contribute more, to the order of the Army, than any or all of the Instruments of Punishment.  The Information you recd, that General Schuyler was about to be created President, and to hold his Command in the Army, was a Mistake. No Gentleman would have been willing for that, as I know. I am pretty sure at least that a vast Majority would have detested the Thought. G. Schuyler is reserved for another Fate. What that will be Time must discover.  It is, in my humble opinion, utterly improper that this Gentn. should hold a seat in Congress, and a Command in the Army, and I took the first opportunity to express my opinion of the Inconsistency and Danger of it. I think his Constituents much to blame for the late Choice of him. I shall think him much to blame if he does not immediately resign his seat. If he does not, I hope some Gentleman bring in a Motion, to destroy the Precedent, by obliging him to quit his seat or his Command. What the success of such a Motion will be, I know not, but I (will certainly discharge my Duty to myself and my Constituents and Posterity) believe such a Motion will be made.  I agree entirely in your sentiments concerning the Danger of entrusting so many important Commands to foreigners. Mr Deane I fear has exceeded his Powers. Mr Du Coudray shall never have my Consent to be at the Head of the Artillery.(2) And I believe he will have few advocates for placing him there. I hope none.  Pray what is your opinion of General Conway. He acquired a good Reputation here.  It gives me great Joy, Sir, to find by your Letter, that you begin to feel your Army to be respectable. We are anxious to hear from Peeks Kill what Numbers are collected there.  ""

  Dr Papa, 2d June 1777 Pha. I have your letter of the 28th ultimo. It is really vexatious that our hopes of making wine should be so often blasted by the unseasonable Springs, and the opportunities of making the experiment thus taken away. I shall not forget your Memorandum about the bass matting & ples. I much question whether any of the former is to be had here. In a former letter I answerd yr. quere about the vines cultivated in the Vineyard near this city. I think you did well to send Ashton back with his money: the transaction was with Mr. Lewis, and I think Mr. Lewis will have more honesty than to offer it in payment.  However if pay[men]ts are insisted on, we must receive them or loose our debts, we can only expostulate with our debtors on the injustice of their conduct, authorised it is true by an unjust law, but not by principles of honor or equity. Considerable Sums have been lent to the Continent, and I hear are daily lending, but yet our expenditures exceed our incomes. You say you will not lend the Continent? Can you lend to private persons? Can you invest your money in any thing valuable without a prodigious loss? For instance can you buy lands, negroes, or any thing useful without paying 5 nay 20 times their value? It appears to me we cannot dispose of our money on better terms than to the Continent. If we succeed, as I hope we shall, agt. G B, the money will be redeemed in time, & funded in the mean while. This currency is too generally dispersed, & the effects of a bankruptcy will be too fatal to our Independency, & livelihood of millions to suffer it to take place. I am in hopes, nay I have very little doubt, but we shall be able to obtain loans in Europe, which will enable us to call in a great deal of this paper, prevent the necessity of further emissions, & of course raise the credit of what will remain in circulation. High taxes & the punctual payt. of interest on the sums borrowed will also greatly contribute thereto, but more than all this, a Successful campaign, & union of all parties: the latter will surely be the consequence of the former. The Tories who have fled to the enemy are treated with contempt, & find themselves in a very uneasy situation. This I advance on pretty good authority, such as induces me to believe the intelligence to be true, and you know I am not apt to credit every tale. I ask what will you do with your paper money, if you keep it by you, & the enemy should  JUNE 2, 1777  get the better? In that case I presume you will lose the whole. Considering therefore how deeply we are interested in the final success of our arms, and that we can not do better for ourselves or our country than by lending to the Continent, I advise & desire you to lend. I am sure matters must be brought to a Crisis this Campaign, we shall either conquer, submit unconditionally, or a compromise will take place. Of these 3 events the former is the most probable (at least I think so) the last (a compromise) the most improbable. Again therefore I advise you to lend. Altho' an unjust law has been passed by the legislature of Maryd., it behoves us to be just to our country & help it all we can.  By letters this day recd. from G. Washington dated 31 ultimo,1 we learn that the enemy have reinforced their army at Brunswick with two brigades from N. York. Part of these brigades consist of the troops lately brought from Rhode Island. It is said some troops have lately arrived from England or Canada, they have brought to Brunswick 200 wagons from N. York & Long Island. G. Washington thinks they intend an attack on this city, but the enemy give out they intend attacking his army; & I am of this opinion, for till they can defeat & disperse his army, the taking of Pha. will not bring them a whit nearer their journey's end. The Tories in N. York are in great consternation preparing to follow the enemy & leave that city. I hope many of them will take the advantage of the Amnesty published by the N. York Convention. Jersey is preparing a similar one, which I expect will be followed by good consequences, for the Tories as I said before, begin to be sick of their company & repent their conduct. I think you treated Lotbiniere as he deserved; I would not choose to be troubled with any more domestic chaplains. I did not receive by this post any letter from Molly. My love to her & her Mama. God grant you health & long continuance of it. I am, yr. affectionate Son, C.C. of Carrollton  P.S. Mr. Curle at the boling green 14 miles from Port Royal on Rapahanock makes ash corks at 1/2 dollar the gross. If you find a safe opportunity do send me 2100 in continental money, I shall want that sum to clear me of this city if I stay here to the beginning of next month. Perhaps my stay will be longer. It depends on our circumstances & the temperature of the weather.  ""

  Dear Papa, Pha. 7th June 1777. By a letter from General Poor, who commands at Tionderoga, dated the 27th past we are informed that the vanguard of the enemy's army was then within 50 miles of his garrison, which was weak & not well supplied with provisions. If the enemy push on with alacrity Poor must evacuate the lines at Tionderoga & retreat into mount Independance, where he may possibly hold out till our an army can be collected & march to his relief. Perhaps it will be impossible for him to save his military stores, cannon &c which are in the lines. However I have some faint hopes the enemy will proceed with their usual caution & delay. I wish our stores & troops at Tionderoga & mount Independance (opposite to Tionderoga) were removed to Fort Nicholson, called Chessire's in my journal.  It is the common opinion, and of General Washington also, that the enemy will soon march to this city thro' the Jersies. Some of their preparations indicate such an attack, but I can not help thinking they will only make a feint of marching this way to draw G. Washington from his strong camp at middle Brook, & then endeavour to force him to a battle before he regains his present advantageous post. If they fail in this scheme, Howe will probably turn his arms agt. the Province of N.Y. & in conjunction with Carleton endeavour to subdue it. The Enemy it is said have received about 1900 new recruits from Europe. Much depends on this campaign. I wish Gen. Washington's army was stronger & better provided than it is. Most, if not all the States, are very deficient in their quotas. I think the People grow tired of the war.  I wish you would look over the list of bonds, & get such renewed as are very near expiring. I wrote to you in my last for a supply of cash. I fancy there are frequent opportunities from Baltimore Town, I mean JUNE 7, 1777  such as you might trust to. Simpson has sent me a pair of shoes for Molly. I shall get those for which she sent up the silk made immediately for 30/ a pair. Simpson asks 45/ & no dependance on him. Every thing is most exorbitantly dear in this city, in short the continental currency seems daily to depreciate. However I hope we shall surmount this the greatest, & all our other difficulties. What cannot w isdom, perseverance, & virtue affect? Yet we abound not in either. I have more confidence of success, from the blunders of our enemy than our own good conduct.

But, having been an ear witness to such like proceeding, too, too often, since you left us, my stomach is not set for it at this present hour.  By 5 to 4 & 2 divided, the northern department has been lined out, and Genl. Schyler sent to take the command.(1) By a repeal of an old resolve, he will not appear to be obligesl to make his Head Quarters at Albany, 100 miles from the army; nor is he obliged to go from that city except by true military feelings. Can you readily determine in your own mind where he will reside, from the data now before you? Genl. Gates will most assuredly not take the post of hazard both to his life & reputation to be under the absolute direction of a man 35 leagues off, in treaties with Indians or acting as a Providor to his army at the same distance. I daily expect to hear of Confusion from that Department.  The Compliments which you desired me to present were gratefully received by Mr. & Mrs. Duncan, at whose house, however, I do not lodge. He thought it not for his interest to entertain us more than a Week after you went away; and therefore desired us to accommodate ourselves elsewhere. I lodge at Mrs. Cheeseman's with Collo. Whipple, Judge Frost from N Hampshire and the Gentlemen who, you know, lodged there at yr. departure.  We have nothing foreign of any import, unless you will call news from the Mississipi foreign.(2) The Governour of New Orleans will accept a salute from a British Sloop of War which is watching our trade in that district. He has also ordered Spanish papers to be put on board our vessels at a certain Look-out before they can fall in with the Sloop of war, and the English papers to be conveyed to him by Land with several other friendly arrangements. You may recollect that Blankets &cc were to be lodged at New Orleans by the Spanish Ambassador to be lent to us. This I think is by no means for a News paper tho' I could not avoid giving you the agreable hint of it.  Should you be at Hartford when you receive this please to present my Complimts. to Capt. Ledlie & Family. I will endeavour to gain intelligence from his daughter, if the bearer of Mr. Morris's letter, from which I learnt the news on the other side, should be able to give me any. Mr. Morris not being in town at present I know not what course to pursue; but I will not neglect to write if I succeed.  I am, Sir, Your Friend & very humble Servant, James Lovell  ""

  June 8. 1777 Upon an Invitation from the Board of War of Pensilvania, a Committee was appointed a few days ago to go down Delaware River and take a View of the Works there, erected with a View to prevent the Enemy from coming up to Philadelphia by Water. Mr. Duer, your humble servant and Mr. Middleton made the Committee.(1)  Yesterday we went, in three Boats, with Eight Oars each. Mr. Rittenhouse, Coll. Bull and Coll. Deane, went from the Pensilvania Board of War. General Arnold, General De Coudrai, an experienced French oflicer of Artillery, Monsr. Le Brune, an Engineer, and Mr. Rogers an Aid de Camp of Gen. De Coudray were in Company.  We had a Band of Musick in Company which is very agreable upon the Water.  We went first to Billingsport, about 10 Miles down the River on the Jersey side, where the River is obstructed with Vesseaux de Frizes, and where a large Fort is laid out with a great deal of Work done upon it.  We then came back to Fort Island, or Province Island, where the River is obstructed again, and the only Passage for shipps is commanded by a Fort of 18. 18. Pounders. Here lay the Fire ships, Fire Rafts, floating Batteries, Gallies and the Andrew Doria, and the fine new Frigate Delaware.  We then crossed the River and went to Red Point on the Jersey side, where Coll. Bull has thrown up the strongest Works that I have ever seen. Here We dined, and after Dinner Coll. Bull ordered out his Regiment upon the Parade, where they went through their Exercises and Maneuvres, very well.  We had a long Passage home and made it 9 o Clock before We reached the Wharf. We suffered much with the Heat, yet upon the whole it was an agreable day.  Upon our Return to Town We expected to hear some News but not a Word had been received. All is quiet still. How long will this Calm continue?  I begin to suspect We shall have an unactive Campaign-that How will shut himself up, in some impregnable Post, and lie still. We shall see, however, and I think We shall trouble him whether he moves or lies still.  ""

  June 8. [1777 This Moment I had yours of this days date put into my Hand.(1) I am ashamed that I had not answered your other Letter before: But my Apology for it, is ill Health, which has obliged me to devote my Mornings and Evenings to Exercise and Relaxation.  The Information you give me, that Desertions from the Enemy are plentifull, gives me Pleasure, but the Resolution of the Militia to turn out and assist you, gives me much more. Nothing however contributes so much to my Happiness, as the accounts I hear, that Discipline, order, subordination, Cleanliness, Health and Spirits are so rapidly increasing in our Army. All depends upon this. This will surely conduct us to Honour, Glory, and Tryumph: as the Reverse would certainly end in our Disgrace and Ruin.  There are two other Things upon which our Prosperity depends. The one is the Reputation of our Loan offices, and the other is the Resolution of the Assemblies to proceed to tax the People as deep as they can bare. If Men who have Money can be persuaded to lend it to the Public: and if the assemblies can be convinced of the Necessity of proceeding to tax their Constituents: and if the People can be convinced of this Sacred Truth that it is their Interest to pay high Taxes, We shall be able to avoid emitting more Money, and to sustain the Credit of that already out. But, if not, our Money will be a Bubble and we shall be in order in terrible Distress. We shall not lose the Cause, for We will Carry on the War by Barter: We will call in all the Plate: We will marchl out all at once, and crush the Snakes in their Nests: We will do any thing, rather than fail: But we shall be put to a great deal of confusion and Perplexity. We have no News. Shall always be happy to learn News from you especially if it be good.  I am your Friend .& most obedient servant, John Adams  ""

We have pretty good intelligence that our Enemies are satisfied of this, & are therefore determined to try this full force of corruption.

I have but little expectation that this will come fairly to your hand; therefore I here insert a curse for the dirty scoundrel who shall be guilty of opening it.(2)  I am sorry I did not press you in my last to keep yourself easy till you could be called away from the northward with honour upon some occasion which must soon offer. I wish Boston was at present such a post of honor as to merit your acceptance. But without some more certain danger, and a number of troops of some figure, I cannot think it worthy of you. As danger is talked of in your quarter I doubt not your presence there will be most agreable to the Commander of the Department.(3) It is understood here that you have no objection to his residing with the army where you are; but you do not like to be controuled by a senior JUNE 8, 1777  at a distance from the field of danger. I can only say at large I hope the army at Ty will not be ruined by any misunderstandings of its Leaders.  I am writing to you before the post arrives; I expect much fret when he delivers what is now on the road from you.  I have lost more flesh by the devilish arrangement than I shall recover again this season. I do not however wish myself under Ground nor you.  If you should receive this anywhere on the other side of the Jersies, I beg you would speedily give me one line in return.  The Governour of New Orleans is ready to do us every kind service. He will not allow harbour to British vessels, but gives Spanish papers to all the colony traders bound up the Mississipi, to secure them from a Sloop of War cruising in his neighbourhood.

  Dr Papa, 10th June 1777. Ph[iladelphi]a. The inclosed Pen[nsylvani]a packet will give you almost all the intelligence stirring here. The letter, of which an extract is published under the Ph[iladelphi]a head from a gentleman of eminence & character in the West Indies comes from Mr. Bingham the continental Agent at Martinico,(1) and therefore altho' the name of Charles Thompson is not signed, you may look upon the intelligence as authentick. There is a pos- JUNE 10, 1777  sibility that the answer of their High mightinesses may not be strictly true, and therefore it was thought prudent not to publish the intelligence as coming from Congress; but we believe the answer to be genuine, as it comes from our Agent, who writes that he thinks a war between England & France inevitable, as the subjects of each State begin to be exasperated agt. each other & to make reprisals. Gen. Washington writes of the 5th instant that by late intelligence recd. from G. Poor, the enemy, who had come up to Split Rock, & of which I advised you in my last, had fallen down the lake & returned, it was supposed to St. Johns. If the conjecture of G. Washington's informant from N. York be true that the late reinforcements (about 2000) arrived at that city came from Canada, it is most probable the enemy will not attack Tionderoga this year, but content themselves with the command of Lake Champlain, by which they will effectually prevent our invading Canada. The Enemy are certainly meditating an expedition by water, agt what place is uncertain, but the General & most others think agt. this City.  Colo. Sim this moment delivered me £100 from you with a letter from Molly of the 1st instant inclosing 240 of Miss Carroll's money. I will answer Molly's letter by the next post, she shall have her shoes by Col. Sim & some other things. I shall deliver Miss Lucy Leonard the memorandum for Miss Carroll. I beg you will act cautiously with respect to the continental money; remember the opposition of one man cannot counteract a law & you will only make yourself enemies. Upon my word, I would not generally incur the odium of a whole People for a million a year. Give my love to Molly & to little Poll. I am glad to hear by Col. Sim that her cold is going off.

  My dear Sir Philadelphia June 11. 1777 The honourable Samuel Hewes (1) Esqr a Delegate in Congress from North Carolina from 1774 to 1777, being bound on a Journey to Boston for the Recovery of his Health, I do myself the Honour to introduce him to you.  He has a large share in the Conduct of our naval and commercial affairs, having been a member of the naval and marine Committees, and of the Secret Committee from the first.  I wish you would be kind enough to introduce him to some of our best Company, and give him a line to Dr Winthrop, that he may have an opportunity of seeing the Curiosities of Harvard Colledge. I have not Time to write the Dr.  What Mr Howes present Plan is, no Conjurer can discover. He is moving and maneuvring with his Fleet and Army, as if he had some Design, or other, but what it may be no Astrologer can divine.  It is disputed among the Writers, upon military Science, whether JUNE 11, 1777  a Faculty of penetrating the Intentions of an Enemy or that of acquiring the Love of his soldiers is the first Quality of a General-but whether this Penetration holds the first or second Place, it cannot discover Designs that are not, and schemes that were never laid. Howes Behaviour Strongly indicates a Want of system.  Some conjecture he is bound to the West Indies, others to Europe, one Party to Hallifax, another to Rhode Island. This set sends him up the North River, that down the East River and the other up the Delaware. I am weary of Conjectures-Time will solve them.  One Thing is certain, that in the Jersies his whole Army was Seized with Terror and Amazement. The Jersy Militia have done themselves the highest Honour, by turning out in such great Numbers, and with such Determined Resolution. This was altogether unexpected to the British and Hessian Gentry. They were persuaded that the People would be on their Side, or at least unactive but when they found Hundreds who had taken their Protections and their oaths of allegiance, in Arms against them, and with terrible Imprecations, vowing Vengeance, their Hearts sunck within them and they sneaked away in a Panic. The Militia was dismissed too soon, and they took advantage of it, to come out again with their whole Army upon a predatory Expedition, but soon returned, and evacuated New Jersy altogether.  I am most apprehensive they will go to Rhode Island. If not, I think, unless they have prepared Reinforcements with such secrecy that no Intimations of them have reached Us, they will give Us but a languishing and inactive Campaign.  I hope you proceed in the Formation of a Constitution without any hurtfull Divisions, or Altercations. Whatever the Majority determine, I hope the minority will cheerfully concur in. The fatal Experience of Pensilvania has made me dread nothing so much as Disunion, upon this Point. God grant you may lay the Foundations of a great, wise, free and honourable People.  ""

Thus much we have said that you may produce if ever it becomes necessary, and now for Business of another kind. We learn from Capt Le Mere and his Passenger that there is Plenty of Blankets, Strouds and other dry Goods in New Orleans suitable for the Use of our Army. The Difficulties we meet in our attempts to import a sufficiency of those Things induces us to look for them in every Quarter and we have engaged Capt Le Mere to return directly back to New Orleans with this Letter and to return from thence for this Coast with a Cargo of such Goods as you may ship by him for our Account. You will find JUNE 12, 1777  herein inclosed a List of the kinds of Goods that will best suit us and we hereby authorize you to purchase and ship the Value of forty or fifty thousand Dollars in those Articles but we would have these Goods come by three or four different Conveyances each Cargo of the Value of ten or twelve thousand Dollars. We depend on you to purchase these Goods on the best Terms you can obtain them and we authorize you to charter or buy three or four fast sailing suitable Vessels to bring the Goods to a safe Port on this Coast, observing however that we prefer chartering to buying, and would rather have them brought in French or Spanish Bottoms than any other, particularly we wish to have Capt Le Mere employed in this Business because he knows the Coast, and is acquainted with a proper Inlet where the Cargo may be safely landed. In order that you may be able to procure suitable Vessels on the best Terms on charter We agree that you may have each Vessel you charter valued by honest impartial Men judges of such things and you may on behalf of the United States of America insure on each Vessel the Sum she is valued at against all Risques of Seizure or Capture by the British &c. You will agree the Freight on the most moderate Terms you can either by the Month or by the Voyage, securing us Liberty to load the Vessels back to you loaden with Flour if it can conveniently be done and we hereby agree to pay the Freights you agree for and the Losses (if any) that may arise on the Insurances you agree to make for Account of the Owners of said Vessels, but if after all these Powers you should find it still out of your Power to charter suitable Vessels you may in that Case purchase on the best Terms in your power, one, two, three, or four small fast sailing Vessels suitable to bring the Goods observing that if you cannot get the Goods or cannot get Masters & Men to navigate the Vessels, in either of these Cases none must be bought, but we can hardly suppose such Impediments to arise, therefore if you do purchase, let the Vessels be well fitted & sound, get good Masters & dispatch them soon as you can enclosing by each Invoice & Bill Lading of the Goods shipped in each Vessel, and duplicates thereof by other good Conveyances. You will take Care to have the goods properly imbaled or packed in Bales, Casks &c so as to secure them as much as possible from Damage and proper Precautions must be taken to prevent any Danger of Seizure by British armed Vessels in the River Mississippi. We doubt not but your Governor & Officers in New Orleans will concur in doing what may be necessary for this purpose and we judge it might be best that the Goods should be shipped on board of Spanish Bottoms and cleared out as bound for the Havanna or Teneriffe, and if shipped on French Bottoms that they should be cleared out for Martinico or St Pierres & Miquilon altho the latter plan is become much suspected, and therefore most dangerous to be used. The Governor & Officers we suppose will readily grant the necessary Certificates & Passports and   you will consult with them & seek their Concurrence in all that may be needful. We think also that you should make it a point not to let it be known that you have any orders to buy Goods on our Account. Capt LeMere will deliver all the Letters he carries to you and you need not give them out till your Business is done. When the Vessels are chartered or bought it should be kept perfectly secret if possible where they are bound, these precautions being necessary to prevent the Enemy getting Intelligence of what you are doing. In short, you must buy the Goods we want, cheap as possible, ship them to us soon and on as good Terms as you can, and avoid all in your Power letting it be known what you are about Mr Morris has shewn us the Accounts you have rendered to Willing, Morris & Co. down to 15th Nov. 1776 when the Balance in their favour amot. to about 40 thousand, say 42,000 Dollars, and he has Reason to think this Balance has rather increased than decreased since that time, and as he is willing to accommodate us with these Funds for the purpose of making the Purchases, we now inclose you said Willing, Morris & Cos. draught of this Date at thirty Days Sight for fifteen thousand Dollars and one other their Draught at Sixty Days Sight for fifteen thousand Dollars indorsed payable to yourself, both which Sums you will place to our credit. Mr Morris also agrees that you may apply the remainder of his Houses Money in your Hands to our use to execute the Orders given you for Amount whereof your Draughts on us in their favour shall be punctually paid, or if it so happens that you have remitted any part of their Effects, so as to lessen the Balance due them, you may draw on us in favour of whom you please with equal Assurance that your Draughts will be paid and besides this we shall ship you Cargoes of Flour back in the Vessels and make you other Remittances to provide for future Purchases, because if we find you execute the present Order to Satisfaction we shall lay our Account in getting from you hereafter very considerable Supplies of useful & necessary Goods, and probably we may find it convenient to lodge Flour at the Cape to be sent you from thence in French Bottoms, respecting which be pleased to give us your Opinion and tell us also on what terms you can sell Bills on France or Spain, if we should authorize you at any time to draw on Madrid or Paris for Sums that may be necessary to execute our Orders. When you dispatch the Vessels with the Goods we have ordered, you will direct the Captains to avoid all Vessels at Sea and if examined by the British Ships of War on their voyages they should have a feasible Story to tell them to which the Log Book & Journals should be suited, and ultimately they are to push into any Port or Inlet on this Coast where they can get in most safely. The small Inlets between Cape Henlopen & Cape Charles of which there are several are most safe, there are also good Inlets between New York & Cape May and many in North Carolina. Wherever they arrive let them send an Express to  us With their Letters and an Account of their Arrival advising the Place and such other Circumstances as they may think necessary and we shall immediately return the needfull Instructions. You will instruct the Masters of the Vessels to keep all the Letters & English Papers constantly slung with a Weight ready for sinking so that they may throw them overboard rather than let them fall into the Enemies Hands. We observe you mention to have paid Monies for the good of the Cause of which you have kept no Account, but that you propose charging such in future. You'll please to be cautious in such transactions, as any Monies you may disburse for the Service of the United States which they in Justice ought to pay, they will pay, but should you or any of their Agents judge improperly and pay away Money under a Notion of serving the States which they in Justice are not liable, it may be difficult for you in such Cases to obtain Reimbursement all which we mention for your Government.  It is not unlikely but at some future Day an Expedition may become necessary in your Neighbourhood, and when that is the Case Congress will no doubt avail themselves of the Governor's favourable Disposition and of your Services so that you have every inducement to recommend yourself to their Friendship by your good Management of our present orders & not doubting but that will be the case We remain &c  ""

Monsieur de Coudray an officer of ability and experience in the artillery and adjutant General in the Artillery of France is now attending on Congress waiting the ratification of the agreement made with him by Mr Deane in Paris. I much question whether Congress will confirm all the parts of the agreement, their Agent not being authorised to grant such conditions; but tho' they are very advantageous to Mr. de Coudray, and some of them of an important nature, yet I think they ought to be complied with, if the compliance will not create too much dissatisfaction in our army.

He is moreover a man of letters, and certainly of distinguished merit in his profession, as he was appointed by the Ministry to superintend, under the Director General of Artillery, the casting of the new cannon in France, for it seems that court has been casting over a great quantity of its old ordinance on a new & improved model.  All accts from the army confirm the approaching movement of the enemy, & all agree that they are coming here, tho' their destination is not certainly known. The Secretary to our board returned yesterday from Camp; he says the men are healthy & in spirits and he thinks the army, tho' much smaller than what Gen. Washington commanded last Summer & fall, much more formidable. It is said Putnam has under him at Peaks Kills 5000. The articles of intelligence in Town's paper of the 12th instant, are said to be well grounded. Dessertion certainly prevails in the enemy's army. Within these 10 days, above 20 deserters have passed thro' this city; several of them I have seen, some I have spoken to, and they all agree that they have received no pay since their arrival at N. York. They say the British forces are in good health, but the Hessians sickly. The deserters I saw were fine, hearty fellows, and most of them tradesmen, they are gone into the country to work at their different trades. I shall not close this letter tonight. The attack with which this city is threatened has been productive of most salutary consequences It has occasioned a coalition of parties: a Convention is to be called at a seasonable juncture for altering the Governt. if agreeable to the sense of a majority of the People, & Committees are appointed to collect that Sense, that is, whether they choose to have the Governt. altered or not. Col. Sam Meridith has reassumed his command JUNE 13, 1777  in the militia; Cadwallader is sent for, & will no doubt follow Meredith's example; in five days, General Mifflin this day to be one, there would be j thousand militia collected at or near this city. 1100 met on the Common this day. Gen. Mifflin made them a spirited harangue which was received with great applause. No Forces will be suffered to act as a neutral part, all must bear arms except Quakers, Monr. de Coudray, who was present at the review this day, spoke to me in high strains of compliment about the militia; he says they are the best Militia he ever saw. He is not a man of compliments, tho' polite, and therefore I lay the greater stress on his praises, as I believe them justly due. He farther remarked that Mifflin's harangue, great part of which he understood, called to his mind the times of Ancient Greece & Rome. I really am pleased with this gentleman, his address, tho' a Frenchman, is not elegant & easy, yet you may plainly see he has frequented & even been intimate with the Polite & Great. He seems to have studied more the arts & sciences than the Graces; yet his plain & unaffected manner, his good sense, & sweetness of temper gains upon us daily.  Saturday morning o'clock 14th June About 1 o'clock last night I was awakened by an express to General Arnold, who lodges in this house. The express came from Bristol, & brings an account that the alarm guns from Rocky Hill & Princetown to Trenton were fired about 10 o'clock last night, a signal of the approach & movement of the enemy, and to alarm the militia of the Jersies, who have agreed to turn out & harass the enemy on their march. I can not help thinking it a false alarm, for I cannot persuade myself the enemy will hazard a march thro' the Jersies & an attack on this city, till they receive reinforcements either from Canada or Europe, and not above 1500 have yet arrived, and they are said to be sickly.  Monday's post will bring us interesting intelligence, which you may depend on being communicated to you by the post which will set off from this city next Tuesday. Please to present my complts to the Messrs. Howards & Capt. Ireland. I am, yr. most affectionate Son,  Ch Carroll of Carrollton P.S. Do not forget to go over the list of bonds & examine which are near expiring.  ""

  Gentlemen Philadelphia June 13th. 1777 Though the Dispatches prepared some Time since are not gone,(1) we JUNE 13, 1777  think it best to write you again and give you an exact Account of the Situation of our Army & military Affairs to this Time. You were formerly made acquainted that immediately after our important Victory at Princeton on the 3d of January, General Washington took Post at Morris-Town, which appears to have been a well chosen Situation. From thence sending out Detachments of his Army, he speedily drove the Enemy from Hackensac, Chatham, Springfield, Westfield & Elizabeth Town; all which Places we have possessed ever since that Time, as well as Millstone and Princeton on the West, and Cranbury to the South, the Enemy having been confined to a narrow Communication upon Rariton River from Brunswick to Amboy 12 Miles. About ten Days ago, General Washington moved his Headquarters towards the Enemy, to a Place called Middle Brook about 8 Miles from Brunswick. He has now called in most of his outposts; and the Enemy have done the same, being chiefly collected about Brunswick, and just upon the Eve of some Movement, which is generally supposed to be intended against this City. We are taking every Measure to disappoint them, and have good Hopes, in Dependance upon divine Providence, as our Army has been augmenting daily for three Months past. It is given out that the Enemy intend to come up Delaware Bay with their Ships as well as by Land through New Jersey. It is probable that before the Vessel sails we shall have something to add upon this Subject.  In the northern Department Things are yet intirely quiet. We have a pretty strong Body at Tyconderoga. Some small Parties of the Enemy were up the Lake lately a considerable Way but are gone again & there is no Appearance of any important Motion soon. Whether this is owing to their not being ready, or to a Change in their Plan & the Army in Canada being ordered round to reinforce Genl. Howe, as some late Reports would make us believe, it is impossible to say with Certainty.  A third Body of our Troops is at PeeksKill upon Hudsons River, to defend the Passes towards Albany, and be ready to fall down upon New York, in case the greatest part of the Enemy's Army should be drawn from that Place. The Convention of that State has issued an Act of Indemnity, to encourage those who had been seduced to join the Enemy to return, which has had a very happy Effect.  Upon the whole, our Affairs wear as favorable an Aspect as at any Time since the Beginning of the War. And the Unanimity of all Ranks in the different States in Support of our Independence is greater than at any preceeding Period. The arbitrary Conduct, the Cruelty & Barbarity of the Enemy for the 26 Days in which they possessed some considerable part of New Jersey has been of Service to our Cause. See upon this Subject the Report of a Committee of Congress with the Proofs in the News Papers; which you may safely assure every Person JUNE: 13, 1777  is a just & true but very small Sample of their Proceedings. We are your most obedient, humble Servants,  Benja Harrison Jno Witherspoon Robt Morris Ths. Heyward Junr James Lovell ""

  Phyladelphia June 14. 1777 This Week has produced an happy Reconciliation between the two Parties in this City and Commonwealth, the Friends of the new Constitution and those who wish for Amendments in it....(1) Mifflin invited the People to assemble in the State House Yard, at the Desire of General Washington, who sent them an Account that the Motions of the Enemy indicated an intention to begin an Expedition, and that every Appearance intimated this City to be their Object.(2)  Mifflin made an Harrangue, in which he applauded the Exertions of the Citizens last December, ascribed the successes of Trenton and Princeton to their Behaviour and exhorted them to the same Spirit, Unanimity and Firmness, upon this occasion. Advised them to choose their Officers, under the new Militia Law and meet him in the common on Fryday.  The Citizens by loud shouts and Huzzas, promised him to turn out, and accordingly, they met him in great Numbers Yesterday.  Mean Time, Generals Armstrong, Mifflin and Reed, waited on the Assembly, to interceed with them, to gratify those who wished Amendments in the Constitution with an Appeal to the People.  The Pensilvania Board of War too, applied, for the same Purpose as you will see by one of the inclosed Papers.  The House agreed to it. Thus the Dispute is in a Way to be determined, and a Coalition formed.  June 15 Yesterday We had an Alarm, and News that the Enemy were on their March, towards Philadelphia in two Divisions-one at Shanks Mills 8 rniles from Brunswick, the other at Ten Mile Run, about Ten  JUNE 16, 1777  Miles from Brunswick on another Road, a Road that goes to Corells Ferry.  We feel pretty bold, here. If they get Philadelphia, they will hang a Mill stone about their Necks. They must evacuate N. Jersey. The Jersey Militia have turned out, with great Spirit. Magistrates and Subjects, Clergy and Laity, have all marched, like so many Yankees.  If How should get over the Delaware River, and We should not have an Army to stop him, Congress I suppose will remove, fifty or sixty Miles into the Country. But they will not move hastily.  Riding and walking, have given me tolerable Health, and I must confess my Spirits, notwithstanding the Difficulties We have to encounter, are very good.(3)  ""

  Dr Papa, Monday P.M.16th Jun 1777Pha. I have yours of the 11th instant covering your letter to Lewis, & one from him; the former of which I approve. I shall seal & send to the Priests as you direct, the latter I shall carefully keep.  I have heard of your letters to Chase.(1) You really give me great uneasiness. I wish you would never write or say anything more on the subject. What good do you propose to yourself? Will your invectives alter the law? May they not injure you much? For a wise man & of so much experience in the world, I think you have acted imprudently, as all men will, when they suffer their passions to get the better of their reason. The conduct, I should pursue, would be this: I would endeavour to make those who tendered the money, sensible of the injustice of their proceeding, tho' countenanced by law. If honor & justice will not restrain them, we must submit to the injurious act, & tamely submit to be plundered. I believe all the eloquence of Tally would be thrown away on a knave, who was determined to take advantage of the law. If you love me, you will persue this conduct. If you can place the money out at interest in Maryd. I should prefer that mode of getting rid of it to all others; if not, I believe you will not do better than by lending it to the Continent.  For the late movements in the Jersies I refer you to the inclosed prints. Whether the enemy intend to visit this city is uncertain; I think they will not till they find an opportunity of beating G. Washingon. I want my horses: do hire some careful trusty person to bring them up as soon as possible; no horses can be hired here, nor bought unless at a most extravagent rate: and I find I begin to want exercise. Direct the person to Mrs. Yard's in Second Street opposite the city Tavern. Send up Tartar, & Mrs. Darnall's horse. I have here my Saddle, my harness, & Sulkey, so the person who brings up the horses need bring only the saddle for the horse which must ride back again.  By advice from Canada given by a Spy we hear that Burgoyne & M'Lane arrived at Quebec the 10th May without any troops. The enemy have 7000 British & Germans in Canada. They lost last winter, in the Montreal district only, 1100. The Canadians will not inlist.  If you can find out a trusty person to bring up my horses, send me by him £150 in continental money. All the money you Sent me by Colo. Sim was Maryd. money.  Tuesday morning, 9 o'clock 17th June You will not receive the newspapers by this day's post, as they will not come out till the evening. I therefore shall give you the substance of Arnold's letter dated Sunday evening 9 o'clock from Corriel's Ferry. \""Enemy at Somerset court house, 7000 strong; have a line of com- JUNE 16, 1777  munication from thence to Brunswick. Sullivane at Fleming's town in the Jersies 12 miles distant from Corriel's ferry consequently near the enemy; his force supposed 5000. Arnold presses for reinforcements that he may join Sullivane & attack the enemy in front, while Washington attacks their rear. Arnold says the Jersey militia turn out very spiritedly & generally, hopes we shall have in a few days 20000 men in the Jersies.\"" G. Washington writes on the 15th that he supposes the enemy had two motives in view when they marched out of Brunswick; 1st to cut off Sullivane, but this he prevented by moving his Station & making a rapid march so as to get before the enemy; 2d to draw Gen. Washington from his strong post. The General has sent for 4000 men from Peak's Kill under Gen. Putnam, who it is said has 8000 there; I wish he may have 6000. A letter from St. Eustatia dated 6th May advises that 8 sail of the line & several frigates had sailed from Brest for America; that war between France & Engd was inevitable: but who the letter writer is I know not nor how he gets his information. It is likewise rumoured that the discontent in Engd. are got to a great pitch & that they begin to see they will lose their colonies. My love to Molly & Mrs. Darnall. I am, yr. affectionate Son.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia June 16th 1777 It hath been observed that this Scene should be considered as a Palaestra for the Exercise and Trial of human Virtue, if so it is not to be wonder'd at that even the Apostle Paul should have had Beasts at Ephesus to combat, nor ought it to be a matter of Amazement to Us that the uninspired Virtuous should have to conflict with the Vices and Follies of the World. Under this Idea may not this Stage of Existence be considered as a School of Right?  I shall leave it to you to solve this Question, as well as to discover the Persons who were said to be suspected. I have endeavoured to plough with the Heifer, and to make the Discovery you want but have not been able to effect it. I should be glad to serve you in this or in any other Matter within my Power. I owe this to the Acquaintance I have with you and to the good Opinion I have been taught to entertain of your honorable Family. I expect to set out for our State in a few days, when I return I hope I shall have the pleasure of seeing you in Congress  JUNE 16, 1777  when, if you should not have before obtained the Intelligence you wish, I will assist you in obtaining it.  Genl. Howe hath made a Move with his main Body. It was by the last Advice at Somerset, the Remainder are at Brunswick and on the Line of Communication between those two Places. If he should come forward he would meet with a severe Check. If he should remain where he is, but a short time, he may not be able to return. Things look well both at home and abroad. I am glad to hear that you are like to collect your Quotas. We shall have a fine Army and it will be by what I hear well officer'd. It is said that France & Spain are about to divide Portugal between them, that She hath called upon Britain for Assistance, and that Burgoyne is gone or going with some Troops to their Aid. Mynherr hath given a laconick Answer to Mr. York. In a Word John Bull is in poor Loaf. Tryon hath issued a Proclamation requiring Benevolences from the Tories in Kings & Richmond Counties &c. You will soon see the Proclamation with suitable Comments. It makes me laugh when I think of the Situation of the Tories. On one Side, of those who are with the Enemy Donations are asked by Howe, on the other Hand Sequestration and forfeiture of Estate are the Portion assigned them by the Whigs. I believe this same Proclamation will heartily sicken them and all the Tories.  A Duel hath been fought at Georgia between the late President Gwinnett and Genl. McIntosh.(1) The Assembly called upon the latter, as I am told, to know why an Expedition that was formed had not proceded. Gwinnett said it was owing to the General. He said it was a falsehood. Words ensued. A Challenge was given. They fought with Pistols. Both were wounded in the Thigh. Gwinnet died of his Wound. McIntosh hath not yet recovered. This World you will say again is the School of Wrong. We ought to be thankful to our Education and Climate that We are not forced out off Life in this Way.

  Dear Brother, Philadelphia June 17. 1777 On Friday last we received advice from Genl. Sullivan that the Enemy was advancing with their whole force, in two columns, one to Prince town, the other to Coryel's ferry. As we knew Genl. Howe had arrived at Brunswick with a considerable body of troops, It threw this City into great consternation, being in no state of defence, tho it has had so long warning. Sullivan with 1600 C[ontinental] troops & as many Jersey militia marched on Saturday to Coryel's ferry, secured his baggage, heavy Cannon & the boats; and on Sunday morning expected to be join'd by 2000 more J. militia, when he proposed to meet the Enemy, harrass them & retard their march. We learn since that it was only part of Howe's Army, and that they are encamped at Somerset Courthouse. Genl. Washington writes that he did not think it proper to follow them immediately as he supposed their principal intention was to draw him out of his strong camp into the plain being as yet much superior in numbers & their train, that he had endeavor'd to harrass them with light troops but with little effect, being too well guarded with Artillery.(1) Genl. Arnold, who is guarding the passes upon the River, wrote us yesterday, that the Jerseys are all in Arms; presses for the Militia of this State to be sent forward directly, for that if the party at Somerset shou'd escape, still Howe must be attacked while the spirit of the people is so high. Unhappily, tho the parties here have droped their dispute, yet things were left in such confusion by it, that it will be some time before they can be got into order. However as Genl. W. has order'd most of the troops at Peek's Kill to join him, we expect he will be strong enough with the assistance of Jersey to attack Howe. A Letter was recd. yesterday in this City, from a reputable person in Statia dated May 8th who says, he had just recd. a very late Bristol paper which said, the people of England were in the greatest consternation from the certainty of a French war, that there was the hotest press all over England, but very few seamen to be found, that they gave up America as lost, & were beyond measure confounded & distressed. We  JUNE 17, 1777  have not yet heard from the Boston fleet. Genl. Gates arrived here yesterday. Every thing is in a very good way in the north. He is extreamly offended with our proceedings towards him, & will certainly leave the service. Your packet for France is not yet gone, & God knows when she will. I wish you wou'd have some measures fallen upon, to prevent the rascally tory Jew engrossers of this City & Baltimore from buying up the Salt & other necessaries imported into Virginia. None of the importations shou'd be allow'd to be exported, but by public agents of some State in distress & they shou'd purchase only under regulations made by the Governmt. Roman de Lyle talks of offering his services to Virginia, & depends upon you for an introduction When he arrives there.

  Sir, In Marine Committee, Philadelphia, June 17, 1777 We received by Captain Chew your letter of the 29th(1) ultimo advising your having purchased a Brig suitable for an armed Cruizer in our Navy.  On recuring to our letter to you of the 22d August last we find our orders were expressly that you should purchase & fit out the schooner taken by Commodore Hopkins in his return from the New Providence expedition and sent by his fleet into your Port. Our principal inducement in giving those orders was, that a vessel of that kind was then wanted for an expedition we had planned, & Commodore Hopkins recommended that schooner as suitable for our purpose. If on examination you found that vessel to be defective, you certainly did your duty to decline the purchase of her, but we cannot consider that you were authorized by the orders we gave you, to buy a Brig eight months after, without first having consulted us on that head. Commodore Hopkins has never been invested with any authority from us to order the purchase of vessels for our Navy, and we beg leave to recommend in future an observance of our orders only; advising us when you think any alteration of them will be of service to the publick.  From what we have thought proper to say on this subject, you will JUNE 17, 1777  perceive that we do not consider ourselves bound to take this vessel; but as we think that the public service will be benefited thereby, we have concluded to take her, and have appointed Captain Samuel Chew to command her. We now request that you will assist him in getting said vessel ready for the sea with all possible expedition. You will please to put on board Provisions &c for a four months cruize, and make the necessary advances of money which will be wanted for manning & fitting her out, & recommend your doing everything in the most frugal manner.  Should you have any money belonging to the States in your hands for which you are to account with the Committee, you may apply it to this purpose, if not, you may draw on us, & your Bills shall be paid.  You will please furnish us in due time with accounts of the cost and outfitt of this vessel, with proper vouchers; and a list of the men on board at the time of sailing.  Recommending this business to your attention We remain Sir, Your very humble servants, Robt Morris Roger Sherman Phil. Livingston Abra. Clark H. Marchant Thos. Burke NichsVanDyke P.S.

  Sir Philada. June 17th 1777 I have your letter of the 2d & 6th Inst. from Williamsburg & duely note your transactions as therein described with which I am perfectly satisfied & hope they will end to our mutual advantage.(1)  Mr Benjn. Harrison writes me the 7th June that by express the day before you had called on him for 25500. In your letter of the 6th June you make no mention of it. Mr Braxton says he was to supply you with £2000 & you say nothing about it. The latter I suppose may be right but the former must certainly be some mistake which your next will no doubt clear up. I expect this will find you at Baltimore and I hope with part of your Goods safe arrived. I cannot by this Post give you the prices of Goods here but you shall have them by next post. This you may depend, every thing is scarce & dear, I believe Salt is 10 Dollers per bushl. Spirits if good 35/ to 40/ per Gall. West India Rum 25/ to 30/. However Sales are just now at a stand because Genl Howes move JUNE 18, 1777  ments in the Jersies last Week indicated a design on this place. The Militia were called out & business laid on side. I shall soon be able to tell you whether to send any thing here & what articles will answer best. I cannot write to Virginia about the Salt, but if they do stop it, I will interfere on a proper representation thereof from you. I hope the Pilot Boat you bought may answer expectation but I think with Mr Braxton that she has too many Owners.

  My dear Sir Philade June 18 1777  This Letter will be deliverd to you by my worthy Friend Colo Whipple a Delegate of the State of New Hampshire. He is a Gentleman of Candor, and I wish he may have an opportunity of conversing freely with some one of Influence in the Massachusetts Bay upon Matters which concern that State particularly. I know of no one to whom I can recommend him on the Occasion with more Propriety than to yourself. He will be able to give you such Information of Persons & Things as one would not chuse to throw on Paper in this precarious Time, when an Accident might turn the Intelligence into a wrong Channel.  I observe by the Boston Papers last brought to us, that you are again plac'd in the Chair of the House of Representatives, with which I am well pleasd. Mr Pain Speaker pro Temp, Mr Hancock first Member of the Boston Seat and Mr T Cushing a Councellor at large. I have the Honor of knowing but few of your Members. I hope my Countrymen have been wise in their Elections, and I pray God to bless their Endeavors for the Establishment of publick Liberty, Virtue and Happiness.  You will hear before this will reach you of the Movements of the Enemy. It has been the general Opinion for some Months past that Philadelphia is their Object. Should they gain this Point, what will it avail them, unless they beat our Army? This I think they will not do. My Wish is that our Army may beat them, because it would, in my opinion, put a glorious End to the Campaign, & very probably the War. I confess I have always been so very wrong headed as not to be over well pleasd, with what is called the Fabian War in America. I conceive a great Difference between the Scituations of the Carthaginian and the British Generals. But I have no Judgment in Military Matters, and therefore will leave the Subject to be discussd, as it certainly will be, by those who are Masters of it.  I cannot conclude this Letter without thanking you for your Care in carrying a Matter in which I was interested through the General Assembly, of which I have been informd by our Friend Mr J A.

  Dr. sir,(1) Phila June 18h. 1777. It was with pleasure I heard of the Enemys moving this way and am sorry they came no further. As matters are now Circumstanced I fear we shall have an Idle Summer-fighting is at this Time Necessary to keep up the spirit of the Forces-without it our Militia will be dispirited and not easily called out at another Time. Caution may forbid such a measure, Upon a supposition we can Support an army for years to come, but this I fear will not be easily Accomplished. The dearness of all the Necessaries of life makes the Support of An Army exceeding expensive, and their pay must be proportiona[lly....] I take no pleasure in sheding blood, but at this time I think a little of it is requisite. Inactivity, if practised, will ruin our Army if not our Cause. We have many Spirited officers who I dare say wish for an Opportunity to Signalize themselves and I wish their Ardour may not be suffered to cool. We have no late News from Europe other than in the Papers. All seems to go on well for us there, and our Cause in the main may be said to appear prosperous.

  Philadelphia June 18th 1777 In this we send you an Account of the most Material Matters which have happened in the Military department JUNE 18, 1777  Portrait of Thomas Heyward, Jr.  The Enemy about ten weeks ago sent a large Party and destroyed some Continental Stores lodged at Peeks Kill the value not Great, and retreated immediately after. They afterwards made an Attempt to surprise M. Gen. Lincoln at Bound Brook which He vigilantly escaped with the loss of about 60 Men. Mr. Tryon who is made a Major Genl. was sent with about 2200 Men to destroy the Stores at Danbury in Connecticut. Notice was received time enough to remove the Most Valuable while Genls. Arnold and Woorster raised the Militia and attacked the Enemy in their Retreat with Good Success. The New-York Paper which may be Considered as Genl Howes Gazette makes their loss in Killed and Wounded 104, we may give them Credit for twice the Number. The loss we Sustained in Stores was chiefly in Salt Provisions and Rum and We had the Satisfaction of learning that the Cargoes of the Prizes brought in the same week amounted in the first Article to double the Quantity lost. Genl. Woorster who behaved Gallantly was mortally wounded and is since dead. Scarce a Week have passed without Skirmishing in which we have been very fortunate.  General Washington has removed from Morris Town to some advantageous Ground near Bound and Middle Brooks within eight Miles of Brunswick and the following is a Regular State of Intelligence received here since the 11th Inst.  June 11th At a Meeting this day in the State House Yard Genl Mifflin dispatched for that Purpose from Genl. Washington informed the Inhabitants that from the late preparations of the Enemy, he had reason to believe their design was by a forced March to endeavour to possess themselves of Philadelphia, it was then Proposed and unanimously assented to, to turn out agreeable to the Militia Law.  12th A Letter from Genl. Sullivan at Princeton received about 9 this Eveng informed that the Enemy at Brunswick had began to move the Preceeding Night but was prevented by the Rain.  13th The Alarm Gun in this City fired at three this Morning answering the Alarm Guns up the River. Several letters by Express from Bristol mention the hearing Alarm Guns Towards Trenton and Princeton, but that no Express had arrived there from Genl Sullivan at Princeton.  14th Express from Genl Arnold at Trenton informs, that the Enemy had moved in the Night from Brunswick; that Genl Sullivan had likewise moved from Princeton to some Part on Rocky Hill, with an Intention to harrass the March of the Enemy and thereby favor the approach of  Genl Washington on their Rear, and that of the Troops expected from Philadelphia. 15th An Express from Genl Arnold dated Trenton 14th 6 OClock P.M. received here at half past 5 this Morning, says that He had waited six hours hoping to hear from Genl Sullivan, but had not. That he should set immediately off for Carryls Ferry, that the reports of the Country were that the Enemy were marching rapidly towards that place, and that Genl Sullivan was about two Miles ahead of them on the same Road.  NB Carryl's Ferry is the Place where our Boats are stationed sufficient in Number to Transport 3000 Men at a Time.  Another Letter from Genl Arnold dated Carryls Ferry 14th 9 OClock P.M. was received here at 9 this Morning, says, that Genl Sullivan arrived at that Place about 4 OClock and had with him 1600 Contl. Troops and about the same number of Jersey Militia making up the Number already there near 4000, that the Jersey Militia were turning out very Spiritedly, and that he expected to be about 5000 by the Next day, when He should march towards the Enemy who had encamped at Somerset Court House 8 Miles from Brunswick, that Genl Washington continued at his Quarters near Middle Brook 8 Miles in the Rear of the Enemy who were about 7000. 16th The Above makes up the Chain of Intelligence to Genl Arnolds fourth Letter which was received here this Morning and is printed in the Papers of the 17 & 18th Inst to which we refer you.  17th No New Intelligence From Various Quarters lately we have reports but none sufficient to depend on, that the Enemy will receive no Reinforcements from Europe, and likewise that a war with France is inevitable. Genl Burgoyne is said to be arrived at Canada without Troops. We have seen a Memorial Presented to the States General by Dr. Joseph York and two answers thereto, one, \""that they had no account to render to him of their Conduct\"" the other, \""there are no Gates to the Hague.\"" (1)  18.

  [June 18, 1777](1) Unsought for and unsolicited this most Honorable Convention of the United States of America were pleased, for wise and prudential Reasons, to appoint me to the Command of the Northern Department.(2) In Obedience to their Orders I proceeded to Albany to execute the Functions of my Office. Upon my Arrival there I found every Thing in Disorder. The main Pass, Tyconderoga, in a manner destitute of a Garrison-the Goals of Albany full of Tories-Defection breaking out in all Quarters-and the Artillery Stores and Provisions, which should have been sent to Tyconderoga in the Winter, still in Albany, where only forty Soldiers of the Continental Army remained to guard them. Under these unpromising Circumstances I sent my Aids De Camp by different Routs with Dispatches to solicit the Neighbouring Eastern States to reinforce the Army, to supply the necessary Carriages to forward with all possible Expedition the stores upon the Road from Boston, & conjured them by the Love they bore their Country, and by that glorious Zeal, which they have ever displayed in its Defence, to reanimate the almost lifeless State of Public Affairs and by the Vigour of their Conduct convince our internal Foes that we meant to lose our JUNE 18, 1777  Freedom only with our Lives. To the Honorable the Convention of New York and the Committee of Albany I wrote and spoke in the same Strain, and am happy to declare I received their ready Assistance, and vigorous Cooperation in every Measure. And I do, only in Gratitude to them, declare how much they were pleased to signify their Approbation of my Proceedings. By the latter End of May Affairs wore a different Aspect. Tyconderoga was very considerably reinforced. The Posts upon both Communications were strengthened. Toryism was depressed. The Artillery Stores and Provisions were in Spite of bad Weather and worse Roads forwarded to Tyconderoga. The Indians of the six Nations were satisfied with the Spirit of our Conduct, & the warlike Appearance of our Defence. To sum up all the Faces of the Whigs shone with manly Confidence, while Despair and Disappointment clouded the Countenances of the Tories. But this is only a Recapitulation of my several Reports to this most Honorable Convention. Upon the  without any previous Reason Assigned-without any Cause of Offence given----without having lost one single Hour that could be usefully employed in the Service of the United States I recieved the following Resolve of Congress (3)  My Rank, my Station, my Services entitled me to more Regard than such unceremonious Treatment, and I cannot be persuaded that the Despatches of Congress must have miscarried. For it is impossible that so wise, so honorable and so just an Assembly can have treated one of the first Officers in the American Army with such unmerited Contempt.  I have searched everywhere for a Shadow of a Reason for my being so disgraced, and can find but one. I am informed it has been asserted that I never meant to go to Tyconderoga, and that I conceived Albany the proper Post for the Commander in Chief of the Northern Army. Sir, I solemnly declare Nothing is more false. Nothing is more absurd. There is an Honorable Member (4) of this August Body in my Eye whom I saw upon the Road when I was going to Albany. As I had that Morning opened some Despatches from Tyconderoga I represented the wretched State of Affairs that Way. His Reply was \""You will exert yourself to set Matters to Rights, which you cannot do, if you go and shut yourself up at Tyconderoga.\"" (5) I was of Opinion with the Honorable Gentleman; but said Nothing more of Consequence upon the Subject. Had I wanted Advice upon a Point of Law there is no Gentleman in America to whose Opinion I would pay more Respect. But after serving so many Campaigns upon Hudson's & the Mohock Rivers I must have been an Idiot indeed to have wanted the best Advice that Gentleman was capable of giving me in my Profession.  I have in my Hand a Copy of a Letter to General Washington, of the 24 May ul[t]o., also a Copy of the Orders and Instructions which I gave the 7 May ulto. to certain French Officers whom I sent to the six Nations. These will shew that the Moment it was proper I meant to   be at Tyconderoga. Had that Post been invested by the Enemy and I not there I should have expected to have been arrested with Disgrace, and broke with Infamy. My Experience, my Intelligence convinced me, that it was impossible for the Enemy's main Army to be at Tyconderoga before the Middle of July. Just as the Artillery, Ordnance Stores, and intrenching Tools had got over the Lake, a good Magazine of Provisions laid in, everything in a prosperous Train for the Summer's Supply, and my Affairs arranged for removing to the Defence of that important Pass, General Schuyler arrived with your Resolve depriving me of the Command, which two months before you placed in my Hands.  I beg Leave to assert that Tyconderoga is the proper and only Post for the Commander in Chief of the Northern Army, from the Middle of June, to the Middle of November; and if he is not there in that Term Tyconderoga is in Danger of being lost. I have the best Opinion of the Major General (6) now in Command there. He is a tried, and an approved good Soldier. But if he has it in his Power to play only half the Game, it is Odds but the Game is lost.  To explain this I need only inform you, Sir, that late in the Fall, last Year, General Schuyler sent me an Order to detach five of the best Regiments without Delay to Albany: being confidant from the Intelligence he had received that the Enemy were coming from Oswego by the Mohock River to attack that City. I scarcely had Time to consider this Order before the Fleet was defeated, and General Carlton landed at Crown Point. Had I obeyed the Order and detached the five Regiments I should have wanted Men to have maintained Mount Hope, a strong Point that commands the carrying Place from Lake George, which the Enemy might in that Case have been tempted to possess. My situation then may easily be known, when I acquaint this Honorable Congress, that I had only one Day's Provisions for the Garrison Army when the Enemy left Crown Point.  ""

By a Letter from Mr. Deane dated Paris 5th Jany. last (1) I find he had Interested himself & me in this Cargo to the extent of £100000 which amot. he requests me to see remited back soon as  JUNE 18, 1777  possible for his & my Acct. & his share of the Surplus arising on the Sale of this Cargo he desires me to remit to his Wife & Son in Connecticut. Had you arrived in this Port this business might have been adjusted with more ease than at this distance, however we must accomplish what is right soon as possible & the first Object in my opinion is to send back the ship Union loaden with Rice on the same Acct. & risque, & in the same proportions as the inward Cargo. I would advise that you ship only Rice in the ship & not any Indico it is too dear. Other means of remitting may be found out far more eligible & I shall point them out to you & Mr. Bromfield in future Letters, at present I have not time. I think you will do well to sell off only such parts of your Cargo as obtains a good Price. Your whole Cargo of Cloths & every thing else would have sold well here. I mean for enormous prices but it was best that you went for Carolina as our Port is so closely watched. This causes a great scarcity of Goods & People are flocking from hence from Maryland & Virginia to Chas. Town to buy, therefore you will soon find customers enough for all you have got but if they do not offer you such prices as you like consult with Mr. Dorsius & Mr. Bromfield about sending the Cloths & winter Goods this way by land. The Carriage will to be sure come pretty high but the prices here will richly defray it. I think his Excellny. Govr. Rutledge had a good Bargain of the Lead. It would have sold better here but that will not do to bring by Land & I am not fond of risquing anything by Water. You tell me you are ordered to carry the whole Remittances back with you, if so it interferes with Mr. Deanes Views, for my own part I have no objection provided the Remittances are made in such way as I approve that is in Rice Tobo & such articles as will sell to advantage in France but I will not be concerned in Shipping Indigo at a high price. I will sooner pay you £50000 in good Bills of Exchange & receive that proportion of the Net Proceeds of the Sale you make & indeed I will do the same for Mr. Deane sooner than let him be concerned in returns that must sink Money. Therefore youll please to let me know your determination on this subject soon as possible but if you agree to remit totally in Rice, Tobo. & such other ways as I shall hereafter point out I shall agree that the whole net proceeds be invested in that way & returned back to France where I shall be content to receive my proportion of proffit or if the vessells are taken to pay my part of the loss. I wish to have a Copy of your Invo. & a Copy of the Sales you make for my Governmt & Satisfaction. You desire to know the State of military Operations. Suffice it for the present to tell you the Campaign is just opened & it is generally supposed the Ennemy look with longing Eyes at this City but they will look (I hope) in vain. Genl. Washington is watching their motions & you may depend he is a powerfull & dangerous Foe to them. The American Affairs look Better now than they have ever done since the Commencement of the War.

  Dear sir Philadelphia June 19. 1777 Yours of the 5th inst. is before me. (1) It may be very true, that your Regiments are as ful1 as those of any other State, but none of yours were so early in the Field-and We must not flatter ourselves with the Reflections that ours are as full as others. When many Daughters do virtuously we must excell them all. We are the most powerfull State. We are so situated as to obtain the best Intelligence. We were first in this Warfare, and therefore we must take the Lead, and set the Example the others will follow.  The Armies at Ti and in the Jersies begin to be very respectable, but not one half so numerous as they ought to be. We must not remit our Exertions.  You must not decline your Appointment to the Navy Board. If you should, I know not who will succeed. Congress have passed no order for a constant Residence at Boston. No doubt the most of your Time will be taken up at Boston, but you need not renounce your Native Town and County. It is a Board of very great Importance. I hope your Commissions and Instructions will be soon forwarded. The Cause of their delay so long is the same, I suppose, that has retarded all other marine affairs. Causes, which it would be thought [injudicious ?] to explain.  I am very sorry to see in the Papers, the appearance of Disunion between the General Court and the Town of Boston, and to learn from private Letters that there are Divisions between the Eastern and Western Part of our Commonwealth. I wish to know the Run of the Instructions from the Towns, on the subject of a Constitution, and whether you are in a Way to frame one. Surely the longer this Measure is delayed, the more difficult it will be to accomplish. The Rage of Speculation, Improvement and Refinement is unbounded, and the longer it is suffered to indulge itself the wilder it will grow.  JUNE 19, 1777  I am much mortified that our State have neglected so long, to Number their Regiments, and to send Us a List of them and of all their officers. We loose one half the Reputation, that is due to Us, for want of a little Method and Regularity in Business.  We are much embarrassed here with foreign officers. We have three capital Characters here. Monsr. De Coudray, General Conway, and Monsr De la Balme. These are great and learned Men. Coudray is the most promising officer in France. Coudray is an officer of Artillery, Balme of Cavalry, and Conway of Infantry. Coudray has cost Us dear. His Terms are very high, but he has done Us such essential Service in France, and his Interest is so great and so near the Throne, that it would be impolitick not to avail ourselves of him.  I live here at an Expence that will astonish my Constituents, and expose me, I fear to Reflections. I Spend nothing myself. I keep no Company-and I live as Simply as any Member of your House, without Exception. But my Horses are eating their Heads off, and my own and servants Board are beyond any Thing you can conceive. I would have sold my Horses and sent home my Servant, but We have been every Moment in Expectation of the Enemy to this Town, which would oblige me to move, and in that Case such Confusion would take Place and Such a Demand for Horses to remove Families and Effects into the Country that I should not be able to obtain one to ride fifty miles for Love nor Money.  I have not made, and I cant make an exact Computation but I dont believe my bare Expences, here, if I should stay with my servant and Horses the whole year will amount to less than two Thousand Dollars. If my Constituents are startled at this, I can not help it, they must recall me.  We are in hourly Expection of momentous Intelligence, from every Quarter. Heaven grant it may be prosperous and pleasing.  ""

  Sir War Office June l9th. 1777 (1) I have endeavoured by Direction of the Board of War repeatedly to procure exact Accounts of the Receipt & Distribution of Military Stores, Arms &c received by the several Agents into their Custody on Continental Acct but have not yet been able to do it with any Degree of Precision. I intend however to persevere & when I have received Satisfaction on this Head shall transmitt to your Excellency exact Returns that you may be enabled to form your Measures as to ordering Supplies for the Army accordingly. The greatest Quantity of Ammuni JUNE 19, 1777  tion & Stores will I apprehend be at Springfield whither I was directed to write for a Return but knew not to whom I should address my Letter, & must beg of your Excellency Information of the Commissary's Name or that you would write to Springfield & direct a Return of all Arms, Ammunition & Stores sent thither from the several Continental Agents who were directed by the Board of War to send hither all such Articles as they might have in their Possession to that Place. By our Account Mr Langdon Agent at Portsmouth must have sent on 9000 Stands of Arms so that if your Excellency should want Supplies of Arms it would be better to order them from Springfield as we have here scarcely sufficient to arm the Troops daily expected from the Southward.  I have the Honour of your Letter of the 20th instant & Directions are accordingly given on the Subject. I do myself the Honour to transmitt a Draft of the Pike or Spear as intended to be made that if any Alterations or Additions are thought necessary I may desire Col. Flower to attend to them. I fancy the Spears will weigh four Pounds each when completed. I am told they can not be lighter & strong.  Permitt me to congratulate your Excellency on the Enemy's Retreat which from the Manner & Precipitation with which it was effected (if it should be effected) was at least equal to half a Victory. The Spirits of our Troops will be raised to an high Pitch & those of the Enemy proportionably depress'd.

  My dear & honoured Sir: Philad l9th June 1777 I wrote you last (1) by favour of Major General Schuyler to whom I JUNE 19, 1777  referrd you for all the Intelligence of which Congress was possessed; and I hope you had the pleasure of an Interview with him.  We have since had the Prospect of an Invasion at this [place] from General Howe, but I own I never believd he coud have reachd so far had the Attempt been made. He was I believe of this Opinion for he never attempted it; detered, as I presume, from seeing the whole Country flying to arms to oppose him. In Jersey the militia it is said turnd out to a man; & the Pensylvanians laying aside their animosities, to defend their adord City, were preparing to follow the Example. And by these preparations, certain of meeting with powerful opposition in the front, and of being p[ressed] in the rear by a respectable Body of continental Troops, not inferior to the British Army in numbers, Appointment, or Courage, General Howe instead of advancing forward has intrenched himself on very strong ground at Millstone near Somerset Court house; and the two armies are contemplating each other with great Composure. In the mean time General Washington is drawing together a large Body of Eastern Troops to reinforce his Army, and several Battalions are daily expected from the Southward for the same purpose. Mr Howe is very civil giving the fullest Time & opportunity for the Slow movements of the new Levies who have all undergone the small Pox. Perhaps he scorns to take the Advantage, or wishes to make an End of America by one great and decisive Blow when all her strength shall be assembled, or perhaps he is not without Apprehensions of a Check which may prove fatal to him, and therefore waits the Arrival of Succours from Europe or Canada. Be this as it may People here seem universally easy holding the Enemy and their maneuvres cheaper than I wish they did; for to despise your Foes leads to Indolence & neglect, and often to Ruin. You may Judge of General Washington's Ideas from his mentioning in a Letter rec'd this day that he intended to discharge all the militia except 2000.(2) This will enable you to form a better Judgement of the two armies than any uncertain Conjecture of Mine.  Since our Arrival here things with respect to our State have taken a most favourable turn. General Schuyler is thro' our Exertions reinstated fully & honourably in his Command. The Commissary General's Department is reformd and establishd on a wise and salutary plan. Mr Jacob Cuyler is appointed Deputy Commissary General of purchases in the northern Department, notwithstanding all the opposition of our Eastern neighbours who being in possession strenuously endeavourd to maintain their ground. A Recommendation has passed from Congress to the united States to facilitate and encourage the supplying New York with Salt and other European and West India Commodities and which not only holds her up in a very honourable Point of Light, but reprobates in effect the commercial Regulations kindly passed by our Eastern Brethren to compleat our Calamities by effectually excluding  us from all advantage of Impor[ta]tion & the Use of European & West India Goods. A Grant has also passed in our favour for 2000 Bushels of salt out of the publick Store at Plymouth in the Massachusetts with directions to the Commiss. general to exchange for it an equal Quantity nearer to our state if it can be done without prejudicing the publick Service.(3) Nor do we doubt but Congress will do [every]thing which can be asked consistent with Justice and the publick good respecting the Revolters from our state in the Northeastern Counties-a Business which will soon be determind !  We have therefore Reason to be satisfied with the Success of our Endeavours to promote the Honour & Interest of our state. Sorry we are to hear that it is like to be disgracd by internal Dissention. Alass is it worth while to greive for the Loaves and Fishes while they are surounded with burning flames? I hear Mr Scott is the Author of [these unreasonable Contentions.](4) Unhappy Gentleman will he never cease to fill his Country with Discord for the Gratification of his ambition! I am sure neither Uncle Philip(5) nor myself who we hear are talked as chief magistrates, among many others, desire to hold any office. We are Content with the Esteem of our Country, which will cancell all demands we can have for services or Losses in the cause of America. If others were as moderate and disinterested our internal Peace and Union woud not be endangerd by malicious slanders and intestine Divisions.  Be pleasd to present my dutiful Regards to Mamma & my affectionate compliments to every Branch of the Family. Accept them yourself, & believe me to be with unfeignd Regards, My dear & hond Sir, Your ever dutiful Son & Faithful servt, Ja Duane  ""

3842,dg007203,1777,James Duane to Philip Schuyler,"""James Duane to Philip Schuyler
  My dear General Philadelphia l9th June 1777 I set down to thank you for your friendly Letter to myself and Brethern in the Delegation and hope for a Continuance of your favours. I was not disappointed at the description of your Department the managemt of which requires local Experience, as well as military abilities, diligence and Activity. I waited with some Anxiety for the Close of the  JUNE 19, 1777  period which made me quite easy as it assurd me that your perservance woud surmount every difficulty; and I knew Perseverance to be, if not your Fort, at least one of your strong Bulwarks.  General Gates arrivd here I think last and immediately demanded an Audience of Congress. He was unfortunately for himself admitted. Discomposd, chagreend and Angry he recited all the great things he had effected at Albany; even the Suppression of Toryism he took to himself. He then pointedly called upon me and proceeded to a personal familiarity which was altogether unparliamentary. He was not very unguarded in his Expressions (for what he deliverd was from a written paper)(1) but he shewd very plainly that he singled me out as the Author of his disgrace-for so he termd it. For this personal Address I called him to order; many members interposd, even to a Clamour and insisted that he shoud withdraw and he with marks of Reluctance was obligd to submit. After he retird he was censurd by several members very freely for his Personality and it was directed that he shoud be informd that it was the pleasure of Congress that if he had any thing to offer they expected to hear it by way of memorial only. I have no doubt but the General has heard very minutely what part I took with respect to him. I do not repent it. The Interest of the Continent, the Honour of Congress, & the dictates of Justice requird it; and I must put up with the General's displeasure, Which I find myself disposd to do with great Resignation and Philosophy. I have since been in his Company. We were civil, but rather reserved. He has heard from several candid Members that only one or two Justified his Claim to the Command and that the rest declard that there was no room for his supposing it ever had been invested in him. He ought to feel more pain and Resentment from this Circumstance than from any thing which fell from me. I am apt to think he does, for he has made no Representation to Congress, and instead of resigning talks of going to Genl Washington's Camp. If I might guess he expects that you will be elected Governour of New York, and resign your military Honours, and that then he will be reinstated in the possession of what he has much at Heart, the Command of the Northern Department.(2) I do not feel at all pleasd with the latter part of this Reflection: but I hate to anticipate disagreeable Events. There are several Ifs in the way-as If it shoud be attempted-If it can't be prevented &c. If I cant be reconcild to it &c &c, which renders it unnecessary to be at present much Concernd.  I feel with you for the weakness of my Country in falling into a party at this time. Scott I hear is much to blame. Unhappy Gentleman how often has he provd the Occasion of civil discord! I am informd he charges the Loss of his promotion in the Judicial Line upon Mr Livingston, Duer & myself in Concert with the Chancellor, Chief Justice & Mr Morris-whom he descrlbes as a faction & tools to a Family Interest.(3) You know Sir how totally contrary this is to Truth; how   entirely I disapprovd of these Appointments knowing the Envy & discontent they must encite; & how ardently I wished the instituting the Governmt might be deferred untill the End of the Campaign. When I left Kingston all this I fully expected and strenuously advised. This Calumny falls doubly hard on Mr Livingston who if he was elected Governour & accepted it, woud do it with a reluctant and aching Heart, and only for fear of injuring the common Cause by withdrawing from a conspicuous office in the Hour of Danger. These declarations are now too late I fear to appease the Spirit of faction & party; or I woud press you to communicate them with my Renunciation of all offices of Honour, Trust or Profit as far as I may be an Object of public Regard or Conversation. All I ask of my Country is its Esteem, which I will accept in full discharge of all my little Services and great Losses, since I had been honourd with Publick Confidence. Let the ambitious divide the rest among them so as they do not by contending for the Loaves & Fishes injure the Common Cause and loosen the Bans of Friendship & Union among those Virtuous Whiggs who when Terror overwhelmd many a noisy patriot stood firmly in the Defence of their Country without shrinking & wavering. But enough of this disagreeable Subject.  The Plan for regulating the Commissary's department is compleated. If out of the press I shall enclose it with these dispatches. You know in what Situation you left this affair. Trumbull is appointed Commissary General of Purchases, four Deputy Commissary Generals of purchases are elected. We had a delicate Card to play & which requird much Address to get this office into the hands of a fellow Citizen for the Northern Department. Our Eastern neighbours were in possession & worked hard to maintain their Ground: But it was of moment to our state who was to govern their markets & by the disposal of immense sums to influence their Policy; and it greatly concernd the Continent that prices shoud be Judiciously regulated & the Army well supplied. I therefore labourd assiduously & we were crownd with Success: our Friend Jacob Cuyler Esqr. obtaind the office, & I am persuaded will execute it with Integrity and Ability and do Honour to my Recommendation and that of my Colleagues.(4)  I enclose you another set of Resolutions with respect to our state which will give you pleasure as it proves the favourable Light we stand in here. You on recollecting the Commercial Regulations lately passed by our Eastern neighbours, so ungenerous & distressing to New York cannot but be pleasd with the Reprobation of their Conduct evidently implied in the first of those Resolutions: and you may wonder at our good fortune in getting it passed [without Cavil] or opposition. The stroke was too delicate & refined to be readily perceived on a Cursory reading; but I think it will be felt where I wish it to be fully understood.(5)  Present my respectful Compliments to Mr Secretary Lansing & let him know that I have not been unmindful of my promise to you & him,   Congress having at my request raisd his salary to 60 dollars a month.(6) Tell Him I am a little distressd in my mind on this Occasion as my Regard for him warped me to solicit a Salary which he himself will condemn as extravagant and I am not without Apprehensions that some honest members will yet get it reduced to 50 and expose my Partiality.  I thank you for your Attention to my Barn & Crop & hope in your next you will gratify my Curiosity by informing me of the state the former is in as I have not a Line from Jemmy Ellice.  I forgot to mention that I find some difficulty in getting leave for you to appoint a third Aid de Camp. The Example seems to be dreaded. You know my Rule is never to push a point till I am sure of Success; nor to loose sight of one which is worthy of pursuite; so that you must not conclude that it is unattainable, because it is not already accomplished.  I beg you'l make my respectful Compliments acceptable to Mrs. Schuyler & the young Ladies & to all the Albany Gentlemen who possess my Esteem & give me a place in theirs, and that yo'l beleive me to be, Dear Sir, with great Consideration & Regard, Your most obedient & very humble Servant, Jas Duane  ""

As I have not yet received leave of absence, I am to impute it to Genl. Schuyler's neglect in making the application to the Council of Safety, which I requested him.  I have therefore, sir, to request the favour of you to solicit the Council of Safety to grant me leave of 'absence for six weeks; as my presence is absolutely necessary not only to arrange my private affairs, which are JUNE 19, 1777  totally in disorder, but likewise to adjust several accounts with the State of New-York, and the United States, which no one but myself can properly adjust.  When the Council consider that I have been steadily engaged in the public service, without intermission, for 14 months past, not having once obtained leave of absence to visit my own home, I flatter myself my request will not appear unreasonable.(1)  I have the honour to be, with great respect, Your most obedt. hble. servt.

  My dear General, Phia. June l9th. 1777 I embrace the earliest Opportunity of returning my Part of Acknowledgment for your Letter of the 9th June to myself and Colleagues. I had no Doubt when you left this Place but you would find Affairs in your Quarter in a distracted Situation but I doubt not from your Perservance and Attention you will be able to arrange them, and to extricate yourself from the Difficulties which now Surround you.  Yesterday Major Genl. Gates arrived in Town, and about 12 oClock at Noon Mr. Sherman inform'd Congress that he was waiting at the Door, and wish'd Admittance.  Mr. Paca desir'd to know for what Purpose-to which friend Roger replied to communicate Intelligence of Importance. He was accordingly usher'd in, and after some Awkward Ceremony sat himself in a very Easy Cavalier Posture in an Elbow Chair, and began to open his Budget.  The Intelligence he communicated was that the Indians were Extremely friendly, much delighted with seeing French Officers in our Service, and other common place Stuff which at present I cannot recollect. Having thus gone through the Ostensible Part of the Plan, he took out of his Pocket Some Scraps of Papers, containing a Narrative of his Birth, Parentage and Education, Life, Character and Behavior. He inforrn'd the House that he had quitted an easy and happy Life to enter into their Service from a pure Zeal for the Liberties of America, that he had Strenuously exerted himself in its Defence; that in some Time in May [i.e. March]1 last he was appointed to a Command in the Northern Department, and that a few days Since without having given any Cause of Offence, without Accusation, without Trial, without hear JUNE 19, 1777  ing, without Notice, he had received a Resolution by which he was in a most disgraceful Manner Superseded in his Command. Here his Oration became warm and contain'd many Reflections upon Congress, and malicious Insinuations against Mr Duane, whose Name he mentioned, and related some Conversation which he said had pass'd betwixt him and that Gentleman on his Way to Albany. Here Mr. Duane rose, and addressing himself to the President, hoped that the General would observe Order, and cease any Personal Applications, as he could not in Congress enter into any Controversy with him on the Subject of any former Conversation.  Mr. Paca caught the Fire, and immediately moved that the General might be ordered to withdraw; I seconded the Motion observing that the Conduct of the General was unbecoming the House to endure, and himself to be guilty of. Mr. Jerry Dysen,(2) Mr. Sherman, and some others of his Eastern Friends rose, and endeavour'd to palliate his Conduct, and to oppose his Withdrawing. On this Mr. Middleton, Mr. Burke, Colo. Harrison and two or three others arose, and there was a General Clamour in the House that he should immediately Withdraw. All this While General stood upon the Floor, and interposed several Times in the Debates which arose on this Subject. However the Clamour increasing he withdrew. A Debate then ensued concerning the Propriety of the General's Conduct, and that of the Members who contrary to the Rules of Parliament. contended for the Propriety of his Staying after a Motion had been made and Seconded that he should withdraw.  The Want of Candor in Mr. Sherman who asked for his Admittance on the Pretence of his giving the House Intelligence was much inveigh'd against, but he bore it all with a true Connecticut Stoicism. Congress at length came to the Determination that Genl. Gates should not again be admitted on the Floor, but that he should be inform'd that Congress were ready and willing to hear by Way of Memorial any Greivances which he had to complain of. Here the Matter ended-not as you will observe to his Credit, or Advantage.  It is impossible for me to give you an Idea of the unhappy Figure which G.G. made on this Occasion. His Manner was ungracious, and Totally void of all Dignity, his Delivery incoherent and interrupted with frequent Chasms, in which he was poring over his Scatterd Notes, and the Tenor of his Discourse a Compound of Vanity, Folly, and Rudeness. I can assure you that notwithstanding his Conduct has been Such as to have eradicated from my Mind every Sentiment of Respect and Esteem for him, I felt for him as a Man-and for the Honor of human Nature wishd him withdraw before he had plunged himself into utter Contempt. You will perhaps think it was improper in me to second the Motion that he should be orderd to Withdraw, but I plainly saw that he was brought in with ah Intention to brow beat the New York Members, whom he considers as his Mortal Enemies, and I was  determin'd to let him see that it was indifferent to me whether I offended him or not.  Perhaps he may take it into his head to call me out, as he quitted the House with the utmost Indignation. Should this be the case I am determin'd not to She[l]ter myself under Priviledge, being convinced of the Necessity there is to act with Spirit, to enable me to discharge with Fidelity the Trust reposed in me.  On Saturday last a Body of the Enemys Troops (said at that Time to be about 7000 but since diminished to about 4000) under the Command of Lord Cornwallis moved towards Somerset Court House. Another Column took the Road towards Cranberry. Genl. Sullivan who was at Prince Town with about 1600 Continental Troops having Intimations of their Movement, and apprehending their design either to be to surround him with their two Columns, or to proceed to Coryells Ferry and destroy our Boats made a rapid March and threw himself betwixt the Enemy and the Ferry, being joined with about 1600 of the Jersey Militia who on the Alarm of the Enemy's immediately Joined him. On Saturday he sent all his Heavy Baggage over the Delaware, and on Sunday proceeded to Fleming Town with about 4000 Men, where he was by the last Accounts received. Genl. Washington being of Opinion that this Movement of the Enemy was made with a Design to draw him from his Strong Camp at Middle Brook, in order that they might fall on him in less advantageous Ground with the Main Body of the Army which was superior to his, and still at Brunswick, did not move. In about two or three Days he will be reinforced with about Five thousand Men from Peeks Kills, when it is not improbable that a pretty General Action will ensue, unless the Enemy retreat from Somerset Court House. In all probability an Attempt will be made to attack that Detachment of Howe's Army in Front and Rear, and as it can easily be supported by the Main body at Brunswick, with which a Communication is kept up the Conflict will in such Case be severe. I have the Pleasure to inform you that the Militia of the Jersies turn out with great Alacrity, and that the Parties have (at least for Time) subsided in this State and agree to stand forth in the Common Cause.  Genl. Mifflin taking Advantage of the Regress of the Enemy has again roused them from their Lethargy; and this City Militia will march in a Day or Two to the Number of about 1600 Men. So far from thinking that Philadelphia is in Danger (unless the Enemy should receive very large Reinforcements) I think there is a very great Prospect in the Space of three Weeks, that we shall give Mr. Howe a very Severe Drubbing, and oblige him to abandon the Jersies.  I am extremely sorry to hear that the Spirit of Electioneering has gone forth in our State. I dread the Consequences which may too probably ensue from that Soreness of Mind which is the natural Result of combated Elections. I am apprehensive that we shall never be able to   exert as much Vigor during the War as we did under the Government of a Convention and Committees. Mr. Scot I am inform'd rails at an Aristocratic Faction which he pretends has form'd and Organised the new Government. His disappointed Ambition will lead him to make use of every Art however gross or Wicked which he thinks will serve to make himself popular. I flatter myself however that the Good Sense of the People and the Virtuous Exertions of those whom Mr. Scot considers as his Opponents will effectually counteract these wicked Insinuations, And that the Inhabitants in General of our State will be able to distinguish their Friends from their Foes.  I have asked for Leave by this Opportunity to return for as few Weeks to the State of New York. I expected that your Application would have obtained that favor for me.  I have the Pleasure to inform you that with some Difficulty we have counteracted the Arts of our Eastern Neighbors, and have got Mr Jacob Cuyler appointed Deputy Commissary Genl of Purchases in the Northern Department. As it is of infinite Consequence to the Wellfare of the Army under your Command, and to the Maintenance of the Credit of the Continental Money in our State, that a Person of Probity and Skill should exercise that Department, I hope he will not hesitate to accept this Appointment.  The Appointment is 150 Drs. per month and 6 or 4 Rations per Day (I forget which). As soon as the Commissary's Estabt. is printed I shall immediately forward it.  I beg you will tender my Affectionate Regards to him, Gansevort, Robt. Yates, and Genl. Tenbrook. Accept my sincere Wishes for the Health and Happiness of yourself, Mrs. S. and Family, and beleive me very Affectionately, Yours, Wm. Duer  P.S. If the Department of Commissary of Forage should be promised by you (which I hope may not be the Case) I intreat the Favor to make some Provision for Mr. Stewart in some Line where he may benefit himself, and be advantageous to the Public.(3)  ""

  Honourable Gentlemen, Philadelphia, l9th June, 1777. In our last we informed you of the success of our efforts in vindication of General Schuyler, and it gives us great satisfaction to observe from your vote of thanks to Congress and other circumstances, that the honourable issue of this perplexed and delicate business has met with general approbation. Major-General Gates, a few days since, arrived in this city, greatly chagrined and enraged against your Delegates, to whom he ascribes what, without any solid reason, he is pleased to call his disgrace. As in this inquiry justice has been our view and truth our guide, we feel ourselves very indifferent about his resentment.  We have since assiduously laboured two points of great moment to the State which we have the honour to represent. The first, a recommendation of Congress to the United States respectfully to encourage and facilitate our being supplied with salt and other European and West India commodities. We have not only succeeded in this object, but with a testimonial highly to the honour of New-York, obtained the additional favour of a grant of near 2,000 bushels of the public salt in store at Plymouth, in the Massachusetts Bay, which for our more immediate relief, the Commissary-General is directed to exchange for an equal quantity nearer to our State if it can be done without injury to the service.(1)  When you reflect on some late regulations of our eastern neighbours, you will readily perceive the policy of the first of these resolutions, which evidently implies a reprobation of the ungenerous restraints which they have imposed upon a sister and confederated State whose misfortunes and distresses demanded a very different treatment, since they were drawn upon her only on account of her attachment to the common cause.  The secret committee7 agreeably to the directions of Congress, have given us an order for the salt, and we shall endeavour to negociate the exchange with the Commissary-General, and by the first opportunity inform you of the results; the price will be that which is current at Plymouth. Several authenticated copies of the resolutions we enclose, conceiving you will have occasion to communicate them to some of the neighbouring States. To publish them we think would not be prudent, as by disclosing our distresses it would but too probably give a double keenness to the spirit of extortion which so shamefully prevails throughout the United States, and prevent your purchasing any necessaries but on the most exorbitant terms.  The other point which we had at heart, and which has employed much of our attention, was a regulation of-the Commissary-General's department.  JUNE 19, 1777  The abuses which had crept into it from the want of method and proper checks, the folly of the purchasing and the negligence of the issuing commissaries, to say nothing of fraud and embezzlement, called aloud for reformation; and the depreciation of our bills of credit, to which, more than any other cause, it contributed, made it a subject still more serious and important. A system is formed which, if properly carried into effect, will be productive of that economy which in all our affairs seems hitherto to have been but little practised; it is now in the press, and should it be published before these despatches are closed, we shall not fail to transmit it.(2)  When we observe how much depended upon a purchasing commissary, who from the vast sums at his disposal, commanded the market and had great influence on the internal affairs of a State, we thought it of great consequence to get this business as far as we were immediately concerned, conducted by one of our fellow citizens upon whose probity, capacity and patriotism a firm reliance could be placed. With this view we recommended Jacob Cuyler, Esqr. of Albany, as deputy commissary general for the northern department, and though infinite pains were taken to disappoint us and continue the business in eastern hands, we finally prevailed.(3) This and other urgent affairs have put it out of our power to bring forward the instruction of our late Convention respecting the new Connecticut government attempted to be established within our jurisdiction. We have for some time, however, been paving the way for its success, and have reason to expect that every thing will be done for our State on this occasion which is consistent with justice and the public good. The beginning of next week is the time we have fixed upon for its introduction.  The expectations of a visit at this city from General Howe appeared last week, from the movements of his army, to be very probable. They now grow more and more remote. Intimidated by the spirit and vigour of the Jersey militia, who turned out to a man, and were ready to meet him in front while the Continental troops were in his rear; instead of pressing forward he is busily employed in entrenching his army on strong ground near Millston, as if resolved, for some time at least, to act on the defensive. General Washington's regular forces are much better appointed and in all respects superior to any he ever commanded. In courage they are equal to the enemy, in number exceed them, as well as in the goodness of their cause; besides they are daily gaining strength while the enemy are diminishing by desertion: so that every thing wears a smiling aspect, and with the blessing of Heaven, seems to promise a fortunate issue to this critical campaign.  We have the honour to be, with the utmost regard, honourable gentleman, Your most obedient humble servants, Phil. Livingston  Jas. Duane,  Wm. Duer.  P.S.

  Dear Papa, P.M. 20th June 1777 The inclosed copy of G. Washington's letter(1) & sketch of the situation of both armies together with the newspapers will give you the best information respecting the late movements of the enemy. About 10 o'clock this morning an express arrived from Fourland Hills with an account that the enemy were retiring again into Brunswick; it was conjectured they had set Fire to Somerset & Middle Bush Villages by the smoak & fires that were seen at a great distance.  I imagine the enemy will next move up North River & attack our forts in the highlands. I wrote to you last Tuesday to send up my horses by some trusty person. I hope you have found out such a person, if so I desire you will send me £60 or £80 continental money. I want my horses much to ride out & take exercise, & I shall want them to return home, when I do next return; I have not yet fixed the time of my departure & while the weather continues so pleasant I think I shall remain in Congress.  21 June A.M. 8 o'clock I have just recd a letter from Col. Fitzgerald dated yesterday evening containing very good news of which the following are extracts.  \""You are pleased to ask my opinion of Gen. Conway. I assure you I think him a strict disciplinarian and an able & experienced officer & possessed of many requisites to render his Services very essential to us. Desertion has not of late been so prevalent amongst our troops. Our army grows in numbers and discipline, and will in a short time be able to bid defiance to Mr Howe on any ground; deserters come to us daily & by what we .can understand, despondency & disaffection reign throughout the British army. I think this campaign must give a final cast to the complexion of public matters. By a letter from his Excellency to Congress you will see an account of the precipitate departure of their army yesterday to their old Post (Brunswick) where I think they are  JUNE 20, 1777  likely to remain for some time. Thus ended this glorious expedition which has been spoken of with so much confidence & assurance of success these many months past. The spirit and Unanimity of the Militia upon this occasion does them great honor, and deserves the highest commendation. They surpassed the expectations of the most sanguine amongst us & must convince G. Howe that a country where they prevail is not to be subdued. We this day have accounts from Boston from a gentleman of undoubted reputation, that two transports from England with Hessians on board are likely taken by one of our privateers, one of which with 82 prisoners is arrived at Por[t]smouth & the other hourly expected. The Hessians shewed the greatest joy, when our men boarded them, & offered their services as guards over their own officers. They sailed with 600, which is all the reinforcements to be expected from them, & as there were 3 of our Privateers together & the transports were but 6 days from land I expect a good account of the remainder. A ship from England to Quebec is also brought in, she had 4000 blanketts & a valuable cargo of other woollens on board. The General is in good health & spirits. I presented yr. compliments to him, & he desired his in return: He and all of us are exceedingly disappointed by the enemy not attempting Delaware.\""  I rejoice with you on this good news, and the bright prospect that begins to open our view I shall dine this day with Mr. John Laurence at his mother's in the country where possibly I may spend this day & tomorrow. He has behaved remarkably polite to me I suppose on account of the civilities shewn him at my house & Elkridge. My love to Molly & Mrs. Darnall. With wishes for a continuance of yr. health I remain, yr .affectionate Son, Ch. Carroll of Carrollton  ""

  Dear Sir Philada. June 20th. 1777 You have herewith Copy of what I wrote you the 25th April & I have to grant receipt of your favours dated 1st & 15th April, Copy of 13th & original of the 29th May & will reply to such of their contents as require it in the order they occur. You will probably have heard before this that Mr Webb was taken going into the Capes of Virginia & he is sensible now that had my plan for that Vessell been adhered to she would have been safe in No Carolina where the Tobo lyes this Moment that was intended for her Cargo.  I wonder much that the Gents in Guadaloupe shou'd detain so long as they have done the Net Proceeds of the ship & Cargo Mr Prejent was Concerned in. That ship was shamefully given away, if you had bought & sent her to Carolina she wou'd have made an Estate by one Voyage. You will see by the Acct Sales sent how the Wines turned out that you sent by the Betsey, Capt Stevens, but I am rather fearfull they are an Article that will frequently be overdone & they are apt to turn Sour. This however has not happened yet & you may venture on another parcell when a good opportunity presents itself. Capt Lockhart was taken & so is Capt Knox in that fine new Brigt of Mr McClenaghans. Your favour of the 1st April brought me Invoice & bill of Loadg for Sundry Medicines &c by the Sloop Independance Capt Young, who got safe into Sinepuxant from whence the Goods were Carted across the Country to Duck Creek and only part of them are yet brought hither. I have agreed for the Medicines at prices that will yeild us fine proffits but in future avoid Senna & Manna, there has been such large importations of these articles that the apothecarys are or will be overstocked  JUNE 20, 1777  with them. The other Goods will also sell well & the proffits on these adventures when they do arrive equal ones most sanguine wishes, but the danger of Capture is now greater than ever. I shall place to your credit half the Cost of Goods per the Independance the Amot. of what you supplied Capt Young & also Amot of what you shipped for Mr Hogeland But you dont mention what this last Sum is. It is well you did not get room for any Goods on bd. Mr McClenaghans Brigt as she is taken & carried into New York. I am very well satisfyed with my Brothers letter to you & with many he has wrote myself but still a little embarrassed about him. He has been very wild in Europe, but since he has had business to do it appears that he has been very attentive to it, the Captains lately arrived from Nantes assure me that he minds his business very steadily and every body agrees that he is exceedingly Capable. Others who I have some reason to believe rather envy his employment say he has such a taste for pleasure that he cannot apply closely to business. I am rather fearfull this may be the case & am Embarrassed between a desire to serve him & my doubts if he will serve himself and do honor to my recommendations of him. A little more time will convince me one way or other. We will quit all thoughts of further Connection with the very Cautious Mr Delap & apply to those that may be willing to risque a little for the chance of gaining a little. We must however remit Mr Cathalan & I shall point out the means of doing it, indeed I have bills by me that I wou'd remit but they Cost 300 per cent that is £300 Cury for £100 Stg. which is too high a rate to pay for these Goods in & for that reason I shall prefer Your remitting from Martinico.  I hope before long to receive the medicines & Muskets sent out by Mr Cathalan if you do but meet some good Conveyance for Sending them to the Inlets on the Coast but if You send 'em direct for this Port they have little chance. That same Mr Nichs Davis is a Rascall of the first Stamp and I wonder you wou'd run the Risque of trusting him or any other person with so much Money. It is not approved off. I will take care to have this passed in your Accounts but advise you to be extreamly cautious how you post with Public Money in future, or you may suffer loss of the money & be charged with want of discretion.  I expect Monsr Schwieghauser will have money of ours in hand to pay for our half of the Goods he ships to you, if some Tobo Consd. him arrives safe, but you had best remit him your half or perhaps the whole from Martinico when you can, as the Exchange we must charge if we pay for them is too high & disadvantageous. The same may be said of Mr. Limozin & all others in Europe from whom you import Goods.  It is a great pity the Hornet did not arrive safe as her Cargo wou'd have helped to relieve your Necessitys, we are horridly plagued to make remittances & the S. Commee. are now deeply indebted to you, to Mr. Curson at St. Eustatia & to Mr Ceronio at the Cape, have ves-  sells loaden & ready to Sail but cannot get them out for if they run into the Lions Mouth it neither serves your purpose nor ours.  Theres no making a bargain with the Owners of the Rattlesnake, they talk of 100 per cent. Therefore it happens well that you settled with Capt McCullough. Your drafts in his favor are accepted & shall be punctually paid.  I was glad to learn by your favour of the 29th May that Cap Ord had sailed & was so well manned, he is an industrious, honest and I doubt not a brave Man, so my hopes of good success in that Concern seem to be well founded. I think if he had come towards Bermuda to intercept the Sugar Ships it would have been the best business at this time, but that is over before You get this letter and you must find the best employ you can for him.  I am sorry to hear of your meeting with so heavy a loss as that you mention but hope you may be insured as You suppose. I thank you for the intelligence of Captain Thompsons arrival at Point au Petre. Capt Luce left his vessell as he wrote you & she rode Quarantine for a long time on Account of the mate having the Small Pox, but I have not recd. any Remittance on her Account nor does Mr. Dorsius mention any such thing altho I have many letters from him lately.  I have sent to Mr Shaw by Colo Whipple to get his drafts for the Money he has in the West Indies. I expect Messrs Norton & Bealle have wrote you fully respecting the Powder & given you orders for replacing the parcells lost & that they have & will ship you Tobo to pay for it. You dont know how we are surrounded with these cursed Ships of War or you wou'd not be surprized that we do not send out Vessells to bring back the Stores &c. We wou'd gladly do it but cannot.  I charge you for our quarter Net proceeds of Indico per Capt Luce first Voyage & the acct shall be examined. I have already told you that your drafts to Capt McCullough are accepted & they shall be punctually paid. We have recd [£1519.3.11?] this Cury from Messrs McKim of Baltimore which is at your Credit and Mr James Warren of Boston advises that he has about £1300 Lawfull to remit us for net proceeds of some sulphur he sold on your Account. This shall be at your Credit when received & also any other Sums that come to our hands. I thank you for the Packet from Mr Limozin who is a very worthy man & an excellent Correspondent. You must Cherish him & Mr Cathalan; they deserve the utmost attention. As to Mr. Delap & Mr Schweighauser they discover such timidity & apprehension that I dont think it much worth while to trouble them, at least I wou'd never ask them for goods again untill they have the Money in hand to pay for them. Your favour of 24 May to the owners of the Brigt. Cornelia & Molly is with us, that Brigt is in New York but at your leisure we shall be glad to have Copy of the Invoice of her inward Cargo Acct of Disbursement & Acct Current with the owners. Messrs. Saml. Broome & Co. of Hartford in Connecticut   have returned Capt John Mc Cleaves bills on them in your favr for 266 8/11th Spanish Dollars payable in Martinico, Accepted, they offer to pay it to us but we shall decline that & require them to remit to you its Amount. You will find herein all Sales of mercha. recd by the Reprisal, Cap Wickes, in which the whole Goods you sent by that Conveyance are accounted for except 86 Swords which are very ordinary & unsaleable your half net proceeds being £742.13.8 this Curry the same is at your Credit. I find that Messrs Norton & Bealle have rather an unpleasant affair on their hands with the Powder, for the Council of Virginia with whom they must settle are not Merchants and Powder being now pretty plenty, they complain of the price & instead of fullfilling the Contract chearfully they give delay & throw all the obstacles they can in the way, so that I have not received any money to this hour on Acct of those parcells that have arrived. I intend writing you another letter by this Conveyance (1) & as the present was intended meerly in reply to those letters I have received from you I shall now Conclude it with assurance that I am, Dr sir, Your affectionate Friend & obedt hble servant, Robt Morris  ""

  My dearest Friend Philadelphia June 21. 1777  It would give Pleasure to every Body your Way but the few, unfeeling Tories, to see what a Spirit prevails here.  The Allarm which How was foolish enough to spread by his March out of Brunswick, raised the Militia of [the] Jersies universally, and in this City it united the Whiggs, to exert themselves under their new Militia Law, in such a Degree that nobody here was under any Apprehensions of danger from Hows March. It seemed to be the general Wish that he might persevere in his March that he might meet with certain Destruction.  But the poor Wretches have skulked back to Brunswick. This is a great Disgrace. It will be considered so in Europe. It is certainly thought so by our People, and it will be felt to be so by their own People-the poor Tories especially.  It will dispirit that Army in such a manner, that Desertions will become very numerous.  The Tories in this Town seem to be in absolute Despair. Chopfallen, in a most remarkable Manner. The Quakers begin to say they are not Tories-that their Principle of passive Obedience will not allow them to be Whiggs, but that they are as far from being Tories as the Presbyterians.  The true Secret of all this is, We have now got together a fine Army, and more are coming in every day. An Officer arrived from Virginia, this day, says he passed by Three Thousand continental Troops between Williamsbourg and this Town. I am with an Affection, that neither Time nor Place can abate, Yours, ever Yours.  ""

  My dear Sir Philade June 23d 1777. I wrote to you a few days ago by Colo Whipple with whom I hope you have had free Conversation. As he must have been not far from the Spot, he can give you a more particular Account than has yet been handed to us, of the late Scituation and Movements of the two Armies. The main Body of our Army were encamped at Middle brook and a considerable Force consisting of Continental Troops and Militia lay at a place called Sourland Hills within Six Miles of the Enemy who were posted at Somerset Court House Nine Miles on this Side of Brunswick. The Right of the Enemy was at Brunswick & their Left at Somerset.  JUNE 23, 1777  They were well fortified on the Right & had the Rariton River in Front and Millstone River on the left. In this Scituation General Washington thought an Attack upon them would not be warranted by a sufficient Prospect of Success and might be attended with bad Consequences. His Design was to collect all the Forces that could possibly be drawn from other Quarters so as to reduce the Security of his Army to the greatest Certainty, and to be in a Condition to embrace any fair opportunity that might offer to make an Attack on advantageous Terms. In the meantime by light Bodies of Militia seconded and encouragd by a few Continental Troops to harrass & diminish their Numbers by continual Skirmishes. But the Enemy made a sudden Retreat to Brunswick & from thence with great Precipitation towards Amboy. All the Continental Troops at Peeks Kill except the Number necessary for the Security of the Post were ordered to hasten on to the Army in Jersey, and a Part of them had joynd. I am not disposd to ascribe great military Skill to General Howe, but if he designd to draw the whole of our Forces from the East to the West Side of Hudsons River in order to gain Advantage by suddenly crossing the River with his own Army, I cannot but hope they will be cut off and his Design frustrated. Great Credit is due to the Jersey Militia who have turnd out with Spirit & Alacrity. I congratulate you on the Success of our State Vessels of War.  Will you be so kind as to call on Mrs A. and let her know that you have receivd this letter, for she charges me with not writing to my Friend so often as she thinks I ought.

  Dear Papa, Pha. 23d June 1777. Yours with Molly's is before me. I am sorry to hear you are again confined with a sore leg. I hope rest & a course of medicines will carry off the scorbutic humor. I will endeavour to get the 4 yards of red shallon & 1 yard of scarlet Molly desires me to get, but I believe they are not to be had in this city. I do not know, nor can I fix the time of my departure from hence, it will depend on circumstances which I can not command. I wish Miss Molly Carroll all imaginable happiness, and I beg Molly to assure her these my wishes. If she regards the honor of her husband, she must not keep him from the field this campaign. I am surprised at Deards going in a privateer. I wish he may not repent this imprudent step. We are now upon the Confederacy. All seem to be desirous of confederating but the absurd claim to the back lands will JUNE 23, 1777  not be given up-however I think it better to confederate even on these terms than not to confederate at all.  Our affairs at Tionderoga do not go on as well as in the Jersies. The garrison is weak, the militia going off, provisions scarce, & the works not compleated. The enemy are preparing to cross the lake with 10000, but I rather think 7000 under Burgoyne. If they should be delayed untill the middle of next month I hope that our northern army will be in a condition to oppose them & that provisions will be procured thro' the activity & influence of Schuyler, & the works at Tionderoga, if not entirely compleated, at least rendered very respectable. Gen. Washington has ordered 4 regiments to join Schuyler. The militia of N. York & the eastern States will turn out to save their own dwellings from fire & plunder, & their wives & daughters from dishonor; surely the noble ardor of the Jersies will communicate itself to those States. If we can support the expence, I have little doubt of success in the end, altho' we may meet with very severe rubs before we compel the enemy to give over their wicked project. I must again request you to be cautious with respect to the tender law-neither write nor speak agt it, but when business requires You to remonstrate with your fraudulent debtors, for such I esteem all those who will take advantage of an unjust & dishonorable law.  24 June 1777. 1/2 past 10 o'clock.

  Dr Sir, War Office June 24th. 1777 I was duly favored with yours of the 20th instant on the Subject of Prisoners, & communicated the Contents to the Board, whose Feelings are in no small Degree roused by the Picture you give of the Sufferings of our unfortunate Friends in Captivity, who are not only smarting under the common Circumstances attendant on Persons in the Power of their Enemies & separated from their Friends, but oppressed with every Species of Insult & Cruelty their Captors, who are but too ingenious in Barbarity, can invent. Measures for their Relief would have been more  JUNE 24, 1777  early & more industriously attended to, but a Remembrance of what Britons once were lull'd us into an Inattention to what they now are. We saw their Prisoners with us, treated with every Degree of Humanity & Indulgence, & supposed ours with them equally well used.  By Order of the Board I inclose you several Resolves of Congress empowering you to open a Negotiation for the Relief of our Prisoners,(1) which you will no Doubt manage with the Address requisite to be used with an artful disengenuous Enemy. If they insist upon supplying their People in our Possession with Clothes, under an Idea of their being able (as they certainly are) to do it at a lower Rate than we can, you need not make a Point of it, but agree to their doing it. If you can bring about the Measures mentioned in the first resolve, it would be much the most eligible, but, rather than suffer our Fellow Citizens to remain longer in such deplorable Wretchedness, you will consent to the Plan contained in the last. This is giving in to the Arts & uncandid Demands of the Enemy; but the Necessity of the Case must plead in Excuse. Let it however be the last Resort.  Their Conduct would justify the severest Retaliation, but our People would in the mean Time have their Sufferings prolonged & that, if possible, with more poignant & diversified Cruelty. If we in this Instance yield to the unreasonable Demands of our Enemies it is because we have finer Feelings than those whose Inhumanity imposes the ungenerous Alternative of a Compliance with unwarrantable Requisitions or certain Destruction to many & the severest Distress & Want to all of our captivated Brethren. One Consolation of the first Water will however cheer us in this Business as well as in all our Transactions of a military Nature. Their Power to injure us is rapidly passing away & the Day is fast approaching when British Arrogance & Despotism will be levelled to the Ground & American Happiness & Independence rise & be firmly established upon their Ruins. As a Prelude to this enviable Period let me most heartily congratulate you upon their Lexingtonian Flight from Brunswick & to assure you that, I am with the greatest Regard, your very obed Servt, Richard Peters Secy  ""

  My dear Friend Philadelphia 24t June 1777 Tuesday I recd your obliging Letter with very great pleasure as it is a proof that I have one Friend left who thinks my Correspondence worth cultivating; for as to Mr Jay, Mr Morris and Mr Yates to whom in Con JUNE 24, 1777  junction with you I addressed two Letters, they have left me entirely unnoticed and my Attention to them at a time too when a variety of Cares being sufficiently heavy upon me, disregarded. I see plainly I shall be doomd once more to my former disagreable Situation; to be banished for a Season from my Family, and to be forgotten by my Friends. I wish you woud tell them my Feelings, not for any Gratification I can have in complaining; but to excite them to devote a small portion of their Time for our Information.  I shoud have written you a Letter by General Schuyler but he was so well acquainted with all my Connections and views, and so much master of Politics and military operations, and every minutia worth your notice that I esteemd it unnecessary.  From many Circumstances you may Judge that our State and it's Interest were at a very low Ebb in a certain Assembly. To add to our misfortune, several of our old Friends-Hooper, Hughes,(1) E Rutledge, Harrison, Reade, Stone, Chase &c &c-were absent and most of their seats filled with strangers. The affairs we had to conduct requird great Address as some of them were embarrassed with uncommon difficulties. My Brethern indulged me in the cautious and deliberate plan which I thought necessary; & in concealing even our Feelings. By Degrees we became acquainted with the new members to which the Hospitable and chearful manner we lived in contributed-for it was no time to consult Parsimony. We made it a Rule not to croud our complaints upon Congress which woud have fateagued and disgusted; but to confine our Attention to a single point till it was accomplished- Keeping every other Subject in the deepest Reserve.  We were told from several Quarters that it was too late to expect any Alteration with respect to Schuyler. Indeed Congress had gone very far to make their Embarassment inextricable. But that Integrity & love of Justice & Candour which ever distingushed this great Council when it consisted of a full Representation, in the End surmounted every obstacle: & the utmost of our wishes were answerd.  The Commissary's Department was our next object. The flagrant abuses which had crept into it called aloud for Reformation; & we esteemd it of the utmost moment that the purchasing Commissary who had our markets in his power shoud be a fellow Citizen of approvd abilities and Integrity. A Plan has accordingly been adopted; not altogether so perfect as coud be wished, but we shall not loose sight of its further Improvement. Our Friend Jacob Cuyler is appointed the purchasing commissary for the northern Department, which we esteem a publick Benefit.(2)  The illiberal Restraint put upon our Trade by our Eastern Brethren and a proper Reprobation of so unfriendly a proceeding from the only Authority which coud have weight, claimd a Share of our Attention. I think we have some merit in obtaining the Resolution of Congress upon   this Subject which is already transmitted to the Council of Safety. It's operation, tho' obvious, was not perceived by those whom it most concernd and the House warmd by a pathetic description of our Distresses, our Perseverance, and out merit, were disposed to give us every possible Indulgence; of which the partial Grant of 2000 bushels of Salt when that Commodity is so very scarce and dear, is no contemptible Proof.(3) Indeed I flatter myself we shall be able to give an agreable account of every Business in which our State is immediately interested. The disposition of Congress is in my opinion strongly inclind to Honour, Justice and the publick good-I speak of the Body-and I am confident we shall never wish or ask any thing inconsistent with either.  Before this reaches you the Intelligence of General Howe's retreat must have undergone your Scrutiny. His motives, if any he had but the apprehension of Ruin, none can tell. But all seem fully persuaded that if he had perseverd in his Resolution to attack Philadelphia, his whole Army must inevitably have been destroyed. The Militia of New Jersey were ready for action; & the Pensylvanians suspending their civil Discord were preparing to Join them. Indeed if their Association had retaind it's former Vigour they might long since have supplied General Washington with 6000 militia, a Reinforcement which must have given him such a decisive Superiority that the British Troops coud not have escapd. General Washington thinks this a very brilliant and important Event for America; in common it is spoken of as a flight from Superior Skill, Courage, & Strength. But may not the Project of his joining the Canada Army be resum'd ? May he not have rec'd Intelligence of Burgoine's preparations to pass the Lakes; & this have been the motive of his precipitate and disgraceful Retreat? If so the troubles of our state which I hope woud have been respited for this Campaign, will be renewed with double weight.(4)  ""

  Dear sir 24 June 1777  I have recd. several of yours. The last brings nothing unexpected. I had prophesied it openly some days ago, on good grounds: and on the same, I ventured to assert that Genl. Howe would never be able to beat Genl. Washington in 20 years. Mind, I say beat not fight, for fear I should be charged with double Entendres. Will Posterity ever know what number of continental troops and militia were watching Genl. Howe's army in the Jersies on the l9th, 20th & 21st of June 1777 when the sd. Howe's Army was thousands strong. Fill up the Blank when you tell the other number sought.  I imagine now the British General finds he cannot for the soul of him beat our army, he will only ravage the Colonies one after another; and leave our military to guard our Independence. I have heard some Gentlemen of the Army say our troops will probably be nicely disciplined by the Fall. This will open a fine prospect for us another year, if the enemy should not be able to get any reinforcements next spring, and should be very sickly in the winter and if our militia should turn out with spirit next summer, and we should catch the British troops then a good way from the Sea, without any Rivers upon their right, left or rear. How we shall maul them ! ! !  Indeed, my friend, I thought I was writing to the Muster Master Genl.(1) I owe him a letter and am so beat out with translating or answering letters from Boston that I must get you to show him this as the best reply I can make to his Sauciness about the States General of the United American Colonies. He will not allow us to be Fabii. He thinks that Gordian Knots are always to be treated alike.

  Sir Pllilada. June 24th 1777  I congratulate you on the safe arrival of your self & Goods at Baltimore & shall put at the foot of this letter a price Current (1) that you may judge if it will not be best to send most of the Articles here, as every thing is scarce & dear, and must Continue so whilst our Capes are so effectually blocked up. And it is with the greatest pleasure I can now assure you of the perfect Security of this City, for Genl. Washington has drove Mr Howe out of Brunswick & taken possession of it & our Troops were chasing Howe & his army out of New Jersey on Sunday they shamefully fled before our Troops with great precipitation. Therefore we may safely venture our property this way if the Market invites so to do, of which you'l judge by the prices. I note what you say relative to the affair of Money with Mr. B. Harrison, also the Sums you had taken up from Mr Braxton whose bills I shall pay for the whole or any part that he may draw on me.  I am glad to find your Voyage is likely to turn out so well & hop we shall have good luck with the fast sailing boat. I wish you may find an opportunity of buying out the Carolina Owners. I agree to your proposal of putting in £2500 Cury, you & Mr Braxton to do the same as a Stock to be employed in these Inland Speculations which if well attended to will produce more Certain & larger proffits than any other branch. You'l be carefull to keep the Accounts so clear & distinct that no confusion may arise. I am sorry to tell you I have received another of your bills on Woolridge & Kelly for £200 Stg protested & shou'd be glad you coud send me good Sterling bills for the amot of this & the other formerly mentioned to you, or if that cannot be done we must fix the Exchange & you must pay me in Curry. & you will dislike this at the high Exchange but still you must consider that the disadvantage is much greater to me than you for no damages can be equivalent to the advantages of having money in Europe at this time.

  Dear Sir Philada. June 25th 1777  In my way to this place I was informed that Salt sold in Maryland for 20 dollars a bushell. There are a considerable number of Merchts. in this & that State that make it their business to buy up all the Necessaries of life in order to fix what price they please afterwards.  I suspect some of that tribe will be soon in No. Carolina to ingross all our Salt & other things, would it not be proper to keep a look out & prevent if possible such a pernicious practice.  General Howe has left Brunswick in a very precipitate manner, our Troops are in persuit of the fugitives & we are not without some hopes that they will be able to prevent our enemies getting out of the State of Jersey but with loss & disgrace.  General Washington suspects that the willingness with which the malitia turned out to oppose Howe was one reason for his wishing to get back to New York.(1) The People here have agreed to postpone all their private disputes about their form of Government &c &c untill the enemies of America are subdued & it seems are now ready to turn out, every thing near this looks well.

  My dear Sir Philade. June 26 1777. I intended to have written to you by the last Post, but being under a Necessity of dispatching some Letters to Boston by the Eastern Post which went off the same day I was prevented. When you left this City  JUNE 26, 1777  you may remember the Enemy were at Brunswick and our Army at a place called Middle brook about 9 Miles North of Brunswick Since which General Howe who had joynd his Army marchd suddenly from thence with Design as it was generally believd to make a rapid Push for Philadelphia, but he disappointed the Hopes of some and the fears of others by halting at Somerset Court House about 9 miles on the Road leading to Caryels Ferry. General Sullivan who you know had been at Princeton made a quick March to cover our Boats at the ferry and by retarding Howes March to give an opportunity to our Army to come up & attack them. But the Enemy continuing at Somerset Sullivan advancd with a considerable Force consisting of continental Troops and Militia & posted troops at a place called Sourland hill within six Miles of Somerset Court house. The Enemy were very strongly posted, their Right at Brunswick & their Left at Somerset well fortified on the Right and having the Rariton in front and Millstone on the Left. In this Scituation Genl W did not think it prudent to attack them as it did not appear to him to be warranted by a sufficient prospect of success and he thought it might be attended with ruinous Consequences. His Design then was to reduce the Security of his Army to the greatest Certainty by collecting all the Forces that could be drawn from other Quarters, so as to be in a Condition of embracing any fair opportunity that might offer to make an Attack on Advantageous Terms, and in the mean-time by light Bodies of Militia seconded & encouraged by a few continental Troops to harrass & diminish their Numbers by continual Skirmishes. But the Enemy made an unexpected Retreat to Brunswick, and afterwards with great Precipitation to Amboy.(1) ""

  Dear Papa, 26th June 1777. Pha. Johny arrived here yesterday evening & delivered me your letter of the 22d instant with its inclosures & £52.2.6. I return you the sundry letters which came under cover of your letter together with Mr. Lewis' letter. I really do think your correspondence with Chase was imprudent. What good did you propose to yourself by it? & why should you wish to be called before the assembly? To treat them as you have treated Chase you say: the consequence would be a commitment; perhaps, to Goal ? Can you at your time of life bear such confinement ? and would this conduct obtain a repeal of the law? Are you the only man injured by it? I have always thought it becoming a man to resent a private injury. I can not conceive that any individual is to turn Don  JUNE 26, 1777  Quixote, or that the point of honor obliges him to combat whole bodies of men, particularly the Legislature of the State, which even when it errs, ought to be treated, at least, with complaisance, especially if it may be presumed that a majority has erred thro' well-meaning tho' mistaken principles: coarse language never yet corrected the folly or wickedness of man, or men-how honest would the British Parlt. have become, if the harshest epithets & the severest language could reform dishonesty? I intreat you to make yourself easy; fretting only hurts yourself & exposes you to the raillery or malice of your enemies. I have no apprehension of Wallace & Co. offering to discharge their balance due in England, in our paper money; if they were to make the offer I would reject it; they can not under the law compel us to receive that currency in payment. Johny tells me he thinks that neither yr. appetite or spirits are so good as they were when I left you. I suppose the chagrin occasioned by the unjust law above alluded to, & your confinement in consequence of your sore leg may occasion both-when the weather permits, I would advise you to use the exercise of your chair, and above all endeavour at a serenity of temper. If we succeed, & I have the strongest hope we shall, the money will be good in the end; it will & must suffer a temporary depreciation, which will not affect us very considerably. I am pleased to find a very considerable, nay a very great majority of Congress as anxious for a confederacy, as I am or you can be. The necessity of this measure is now obvious almost to every man, yet I fear the confederacy will not be formed on principles so mutually advantageous as it ought & might be: but in my opinion an imperfect & somewhat unequal Confederacy is better than none. We have not heared from Gen. Washington since the 22d nor do we know where abouts the enemy is encamped. General Arnold returned the day before yesterday to this house from Corryel's ferry, the enemy have abandoned in appearance all thoughts of marching thro' the Jersies to this city. I cannot think the piece signed Meanwell to be written by Chase-nor is there any thing contained in it to warrant the Major's suspicion, but I suppose he has better grounds for his conjecture.(1) I can not think Chase will attempt so undisguised a violation of our Bill of Rights as to move for such an appropriation as is mentioned by the Major. The Proprietary's Estate is somewhat differently circumstanced, and maybe in Jeopardy. The regalities most assuredly must be surrendered up. A purchase of his Q[uit] R[en]ts would be the most equitable manner of proceedingn but what is most equitable in such Convulsions as the present seldom takes place.  27th June By the Evening post of yesterday you will learn the situation of the enemy Gen. Washington writes they are too strongly posted to be attacked in their present situation, but that he has parties ready to take advantage of their movement.(2)  ""

As it is the opinion of the general officers, directed by his Excellency General Washington, to take the most effectual measures for securing JUNE 26, 1777  the command of the North river, that the Continental frigates will be of essential service in defending the chain and obstructions in said river; and as by your letter of the 9th inst. we find you entertain a similar sense, we now think proper to direct that you have the frigate under your command put in as good a state of defence as can be admitted of, and follow such orders as may be given you by his Excellency the General or the commanding officer appointed to direct the operations in that quarter, using your best judgment in the execution of such orders as you may receive.  We now send forward, to the Council of Safety for the State of NewYork, a sufficient number of blank commissions and warrants for your officers, who are to be appointed temporarily only, until such time as their characters and qualifications are sufficiently evinced and made known to us. Therefore, we wish you to join with the Council in having those commissions filled up with the names of men of merit, whom you can recommend freely for a permanent establishment.(2)  We recommend your taking great care of the frigate, her materials and stores, and keep us constantly advised of your proceedings. Being, sir, Your most h. servts.  ( Signed ) John Hancock, Geo. Groet [Frost], Robert Morris, Phil. Livingston, Hy. Marchant, Nichs. Van Dyke, Roger Sherman, Benjamin Harrison, Geo.

Reprinted from Journals of N.Y. Prov:. Cong., 2:512.  1 Grenell and Hodges were captains respectively of the Continental frigates Congress and Montgomery. JCC, 6:861.  2 Shortly after receiving this letter, Grenell and Hodges wrote to the New York Council of Safety, insisting that they alone had the right to appoint officers for their ships. They supported their contention by citing letters to Grenell of July 2 and August 22, 1776, from Francis Lewis, who was at that time a member of the Marine Committee. The council of safety referred this claim to the Marine Committee on July 25, but there is no evidence that the committee ever ruled on the matter. See Journals of N.Y. Prov.

  My Dear Sir : Philadelphia, June 27, 1777.  I have for some time past, been deprived of the pleasure of writing JUNE 27, 1777  to my friends, by indisposition arising from the climate, & perhaps an attention to business, & am now to acknowledge the receipt of your several favors of March 26th, April 27th & May 5th which contain many articles of useful intelligence. Your suggestions, relative to the Friendship of France, are undoubtedly well grounded, & the policy of that Court induces her to avoid a declaration of War, as long as possible. Well knowing that whilst G. Britain is daily exhausting her resources, & growing feeble, France is encreasing in strength, & will be more able to give a severe blow. But her measures of late, have been so unreserved, that the British Court cannot avoid a declaration of War, If they possess but the shadow of that spirit, to which they have made such pretensions. Would this take place, Spain & Portugal will be inevitably engaged in the War, & the subduction of the latter, will be an object of great attention, with the house of Bourbon. The Porte & Russia, are already involved in a dispute, & probably will join in alliance with other powers, which will make the War general. This at present is but speculation, but the practice, has, for some time past, appeared to me, to be unavoidable.  The spirit shown by the Jersey Militia, upon the movement of General Howe, is a favorable circumstance to our affairs, & greatly tends to intimidate our enemies. He marched with but part of his army, to Somerset Court House, about ten miles from Brunswick, in hope of tempting our General to immediate action. But this being avoided, until a body of troops that were posted at Peeps Hill [Peekskill] could reinforce our Army & the Militia be collected, Wm. Howe, then thought it not for his interest, to risque a battle, but retired to Amboy.  Had General Washington left his post, to have attacked General Howe, the latter might have slowly retreated, towards Brunswick, until joined by the residue of his troops, & then the combat would have been nearly with equal numbers on each side, & might have been hazardous. But when reinforced, as before mentioned, I think General Washington had a promising prospect of defeating the enemy. An attack may be expected on Ticonderoga. I hope the New Hampshire battalions have their complement of men, or that their deficiency is applied with Militia, as the carrying that post may give spirit to the enemy, & bring the War nearer to our doors, although I really think, it would not be much injurious to our cause. A Navy board is established for the Eastern District, by which we may expect to see the difficulties relative to the Navy in some measure removed.  My compliments to friends & believe me to be, Sir, with esteem your friend & hum Servant.  (Signed) E. Gerry.  MS not found; reprinted from The Collector 24 (June 1911): 87-88.  JUNE 28, 1777

  Dear Papa, 28th June 1777 Pha. Johny got here last Wednesday with my horses; I should have ordered off the Friday following, but have been obliged to detain him here to wait on me. Poor Sam has been very ill these 8 or 10 days past and still continues so, occasioned by a violent cold. To day a blister will be put to his side, the seat of pain; he has been twice blooded. I do not apprehend any immediate danger, indeed I flatter myself he will be well enough in a few days to wait on me. I keep Johny to attend Sam, as much as to wait on myself. I am sorry that I am obliged to do it, as his detention here may probably prevent Molly from being at Miss Carroll's wedding. If Sam finds himself much better tomorrow, I will send off Johny tomorrow evening, he will be able to reach Elkridge time enough to drive his Mistress to Mellwood.  The Enemy by the last letter from Gen. Washington dated 25th instant from Quibble Town which is now our head quarters, (1) was strongly JUNE 28, 1777  posted at Amboy. They had sent off & were sending their baggage on board their transports which lie at the wartering place & Princes landing. If the express that carried orders to Gen. Maxwell to march to head the enemy had not been intercepted it is probable their rear would have been cut off. What the enemy intend doing next is uncertain: most people conjecture they intend going up north river to coopperate with Burgoyne, who may be expected at Tionderoga by the middle of July.  The Enemy are too strongly posted at Amboy to be attacked; they possibly may be there waiting for reinforcements, which when they receive, they may endeavour to penetrate again into the Jersies, & force Washington, if possible to a battle; this is certainly their interest; it is a desperate game, but their situation obliges them to run the risk. The same reasons which urge them to risk a battle dissuade us from venturing on one. Gen Washington will not hazard our cause by a battle, unless the odds are in our favor 100 to one.  I have seen extracts from the English prints as low as the 8th April. I do not find that any very considerable reinforcements are coming out. The critical situation of affairs in Europe, & the difficulties started by the German princes, have prevented the British Ministry from obtaining recruits, at least as many as they expected. I do not believe they will be able to send over this year more than 7000 at the outside: if I should be right in my conjecture, their army will not [be] near so formidable this year as the last, & ours on a much more respectable footing. Perhaps they hope to worry us out by the expence of the war. I hope your leg is better, & that you continue to enjoy your health. My love to Molly & Mrs. Darnall. I am, yr. affectionate Son,  Ch.

  June 28th [1777]Saturday Yesterday, tho' assigned for concluding the Business of our Revolters was taken up in other Cares, for we thought it impolitic to be too urgent for a preference tho it was a Right we might have maintaind. Experience has convincd me of the Propriety of such Condescensions at seasonable junctures. This morning the House In a Committee of the whole chearfully resumd the debate; and the Resolutions passed almost unanimously, for you'l observe they go upon general Principles highly interesting & important to every State which yet directly apply to our case. The only contest was on Young's address,(1) & that was ostensibly grounded on his death in the midst of the Debate; Compassion to his  JUNE 28, 1777  distressed family no doubt induced some of the Members to wish it to be passed over in silence. You will observe however that it was of great Consequence to us to have this wicked production censur'd and exposd, and this point was finally carried in our favour after a Sharp Conflict. The debate was spun out 'till after 4 'Clock and the Committee rose and agreed to finish it on Monday.  June 29th. Sunday We have for several days been left in the utmost uncertainty concerning the Motions of the Enemy. From the Generals Letter which the President this Inst. called to shew us they carried their Retreat so far as to send part of their Army to Staten Island; but the same Evening they suddenly returnd with a Reinforcement of Marines; and by a Hasty march endeavourd to encompass Lord Sterling's division which had been employd in harrassing their Rear during the Retreat. Failing in this they attempted to gain the high grounds which General Washington had occupied at Middle brook; but that great and vigilant officer deprivd them of the Advantage by taking the Station himself. The Enemy by this account are at Spank Town; Skirmishes are frequent. We have lost but few men, and much less than they: which is an agreeable Circumstance considering the retreat which all thought as Flight was only a Feint. G. Washington's Circumspection and the disposition of his army on this occasion will do him the highest Honour. What the Enemy, who are compleatly disappointed in this fine maneuvre, will next Attempt is hard to conjecture In my poor Judgment they coud not have chosen better ground for us than they now occupy, & there may they continue Till ashamd of their Instrumentality in support of the most cruel and unprovoked Persecution, and convincd of the Impracticability of subjugating to arbitrary Power a People who dare to be free; they shall in good Earnest fly away from these envied Regions never to return again. I presume General Washington will now draw to his Succour some of the Eastern Troops; and if he sees a prospect of considerable advantage the Jersey Militia and the Pensylvanians the latter of whom are arraying for Service tho' very slowly.  Fifteen hundred North Carolina Troops are passing thro' this Town under the Command of General Nash; & more both from thence and Virginia are expected. The Small pox which they have all taken by Innoculation has provd a vast Impediment, but from human appearances General Washington will soon be sufficiently powerful to disappoint if not to defeat his Enemies.  You who are acquainted with our former Connections here will be pleased to learn that perfect Harmony continues to subsist between us & the members of those States which formerly agreed with us in political opinions. Col. Harrison who by Artful Means was left out of the Virginia delegation, immediately on his Return home was reelected & to the great Satisfaction of every man of Candour has taken his Seat  again.

  My dearest Friend Philadelphia June 29 1777 The enclosed Newspapers will communicate to you, all the News I know.  The Weather here begins to be very hot. Poor Mortals pant and sweat, under the burning Skies. Faint and feeble as children, We seem as if We were dissolving away. Yet We live along.  The two Armies are now playing off their Arts. Each acts with great Caution. Howe is as much afraid of putting any Thing to Hazard as Washington. What would Britain do, surrounded with formidable Powers in Europe just ready to strike her if Howes Army should meet a Disaster? Where would she find another Army?  How are you? I hope very well. Let Mr. Thaxter write, let the Children write, when you cannot. I am very anxious, but Anxiety at 400 Miles distance can do you no more good, than me. I long to hear  JUNE 29, 1777  a certain Piece of News from Home, which will give me great Joy.(1) Thank Mr. John for his kind Letter. I will answer him and all my little Correspondents as soon as I can.  Tell Mr. John, that I am under no Apprehensions about his Proficiency in Learning. With his Capacity, and Opportunities, he can not fail to acquire Knowledge. But let him know, that the moral Sentiments of his Heart, are more important than the Furniture of his Head. Let him be sure that he possesses the great Virtues of Temperance, Justice, Magnanimity, Honour and Generosity, and with these added to his Parts he cannot fail to become a wise and great Man.  Does he read the Newspaper? The Events of this War, should not pass unobserved by him at his Years.  As he reads History you should ask him, what Events strike him most? What Characters he esteems and admires? which he hates and abhors ? which he despises ?  No doubt he makes some Observations, young as he is.  Treachery, Perfidy, Cruelty, Hypocrisy, Avarice, &c. &c. should be pointed out to him for his Contempt as well as Detestation.  My dear Daughters Education is near my Heart. She will suffer by this War as well as her Brothers. But she is a modest, and discreet Child. Has an excellent Disposition, as well as Understanding. Yet I wish it was in my Power, to give her the Advantages of several Accomplishments, which it is not.  ""

  June 29 [1777] On Wednesday last the enemy reinforcd, as it is said, with Marines, marchd from Amboy, through a Road between Brunswick and Elisabeth Town [to] a place called Westfield about 10 Miles, with Design as it is supposd to cut off our Light Troops and bring on a General Battle, or to take Possession of the High Land back of Middlebrook, for which last purpose Westfield was the most convenient Road and it was also a well chosen Spot from whence to make a safe Retreat in Case he should fail of gaining his Point. On this March they fell in with General Maxwell who thought it prudent to retreat to our main Army then at Quibble town from whence Genl W. made a hasty march to his former Station and frustrated the supposd Design of the Enemy. I have given you a very general narrative of the different Situations & Movements of the two armies without descending to the particular, because we have not as yet an Authentick Account, and one cannot depend upon the many JUNE 29, 1777  Stories that are told. I think I may assure you that our army is in high Spirits and is daily growing more respectable in point of numbers.  We are going on within Doors with Tardiness enough-a Thousand little matters too often thrust out greater ones. A kind of Fatality still prevents our proceeding a Step in the important affair of Confederation. Yesterday and the day before was wholly spent in passing Resolutions to gratify N Y or as they say to prevent a civil war between that State and the Green Mountain Men, A matter which it is not worth your while to have explained to you.(1) Monsr D Coudrays affair is still unsettled. The four French Engineers are arrivd. They are said to be very clever but disdain to be commanded by Coudray.(2) Mr Comr. D___n continues to send us French, German & Prussian officers with authenticated Conventions and strong recommendations. The military Science, for your Comfort, will make rapid Progress in America. Our Sons and Nephews will be provided for in the Army and a long and moderate war will be their happy Portion. But who my Friend, would not wish for peace. May I live to see the publick Liberty restored and the safety of our dear Country secured. I should then think I had enjoyd enough and bid this world Adieu. Yours, S A  ""

  29th June [1777] I wrote to you yesterday per post & informed you of my reason for detaining Johny. Sam is this day much better. We have reports from the army that the enemy had nearly on the 27th, by a secret march in the night, surrounded Col. Morgan's regt. of riflemen. They were posted at the edge of a swamp, which the enemy had Surrounded on two sides, so that no retreat was left to our people but thro' the swamp, which they effected with the loss only of 16 men missing. It is said that we lost also 2 field pieces. The Enemy were discovered marching in a  JUNE 29, 1777  long column up to the Scotch plains, which lie to the westward of Newark & under the mountains; this movemt. of theirs being timely perceived, General Washington marched to his old camp at Middle Brook. We have had no letter from the General Since the 25th. It is probable the Enemy are desirous of bringing on a general engagt. & it is my conjecture they retreated from Brunswick in order to draw G.W. nearer to the sea coast, that while he lay in that position, they might march a body of men round him so as to intercept his return to Middle Brook & the hilly country. If this was their intention, it is evident our cautious General has not given in to the trap, & they have missed their object Gen. Washington will not risk a general action, unless the odds are greatly in his favor.  Monday 30th June We had the greatest part of yesterday a fine gentle soaking rain, and this morning it began to rain at 7 o'clock, & has continued raining ever since to this hour (10 o'clock) and it seems as if it would rain the whole day. The inclosed copy of G. Washington's letter dated the 28th will best inform you of the late movements of the enemy & the present situation of both armies.(1) This day's post brought me yours of the 25th instant & one from Ashton which you will find among the inclosures herewith sent. What do you mean by putting off the persons who tender the Currency? If they make the tender, and your reasonings & expostulations with them will not prevent their so doing, to what purpose do you put them off to my return? This looks too like a subterfuge and they will insist on stoppage of interest from the time of the tender, & will involve us in disputes I desire you will take the money when the debtors insist on tendering it in payment, notwithstanding the injustice done us. We are not the only Sufferers, and we must yield to the times. This measure my request, common prudence, & even necessity should induce you to take. I say necessity, for the law will have its course; nor ought any Individual to be above it. The letter of G.W. above referred to I shall forward to you in a letter tomorrow.2  ""

  Dear Sir Philada. June 29th 1777. I have received by Monsr. duCoudray your letter of the 4th Decr. JUNE 29, 1777  addressed to me, but having met with an accident was delivered open(1). Your letter of the 5th Jany addressed to my House W. M. & Co. arrived only about ten days since being forwarded from Charles Town South Carolina by Captn. Roche.  These are the only private letters come to my hands but there are several recommendatory ones in favour of the many Officers come out under your auspices. I will reply to the Contents of the two first.  The many letters I have written to you must have been exceedingly unfortunate in their passages to you, as well as yours to me, or you wou'd have had little cause to complain for want of intelligence as I never let a month pass all last Fall & Winter without writing, & sometimes wrote twice or thrice within the month, but feeling the difficulties you were exposed to, you seem to have attributed them to a wrong cause, Silence, on our part, instead of those accidents, to which our letters are exposed after written Sure I am that all the Congress together, nor any one Man in America has been at the pains to give you intelligence that I have & sorry I am that my letters have not had better success. With respect to my Brother I shall deal very candidly with you, by declaring to you that I never was more shocked & hurt by any incident of my Life, than at the manner in which you Gentn Commissioners at the Court of France have been pleased to mention him in Public letters that you knew must be laid before Congress.(2) These letters arrived long before I had a single Scrip of a pen from you on the Subject. It occurred to me instantly that I had unbosomed myself to you respecting him, that I had solicited your Friendship in his favour and asked you to inform me fully & freely of his Conduct, that to all this I never had one word in answer & found your name at the bottom of letters blasting his character in the most Public manner & exposing me to Feelings the most poignant I ever knew. It also occurred to me that I had solicited Doctr. Franklin to admonish & advise him if he found it necessary & to shew him Countenance if he proved deserving. From these Circumstances I really did expect that any complaints he merited, wou'd have been made to myself in private letters giving me Account of his Conduct and if it was necessary to remove him from his employment, I cou'd have done that so as to prevent any the least disservice to the Public or his being unnecessarily exposed. You will see that these sentiments were strong in my mind when I wrote the Commissioners on the 1st April,(3) and they made so Strong an impression on me at the time Your letters were read in Congress that I got up instantly, gave my Brother his true Character, complained of his being so publickly exposed, told what my desires & expectations from you respecting him were & added that by my letters to you per Capt Bell I had put him in your power, either to be confirmed in his employment or dismissed from it as his Conduct might require ( 4)I think the letter I wrote you by Capt Bell respecting him must have Convinced you that I did not wish him   employed in the Public Service if he did not deserve it, it must also convince you that a Public letter to Congress on that Subject was not necessary to procure his removal if his Conduct was not right for you found me as ready to displace him as you cou'd wish & I begin to fear that I was rather too forward in it. From what I now write you will naturally conclude I do not think my self in the least degree beholden to Doctr Franklin or you for your Conduct towards this Young Man & in plain truth I do not However, I do not cherish resentment and hope my passions may be always subdued by Reason & my reason influenced by good principles; therefore I mean nothing more than to let you know, that I think those Public letters were Cruel to my Brother & extreamly unfriendly to myself. I shall inform him of them & if he has Spirit to resent them I hope he will also have judgement to do it properly. Perhaps I have flattered myself with the expectation of more Friendship from the Doctor & you than I had a right to & shall therefore correct the error in future. Thus much for what you say of him in Public. As to what you write me of him in these letters of the 4th Decr. & 5th Jany now before me, I thank you most sincerely for it, and shou'd do so, had the Account of him been ten times more disagreable. It is bad enough God knows, and what is worse, I believe he deserves every tittle of it. Had these letters of yours reached me before the Public letters I shou'd in some degree have been prepared & probably shou'd not have said anything about him in Congress but even in that case, I shou'd have thought in the same way of your Public letters because I think it was totally unnecessary to mention him there. You refer me to Mr. Bromfield for further particulars & anecdotes respecting this Youth & Mr. Bromfield has kindly referred me to all the Gentn from Virginia where he landed, to South Carolina where he is gone by land, & had industriously communicated these particulars & anecdotes to every body he met with. I must now in turn inform you of some particulars & anecdotes that Gentn from Nantes have lately informed me of.  They say that since Toms arrival there he has applied himself most assiduously & closely to business. This appears to be true, because he has done his business well & given a most clear & satisfactory account of it. I laid his letters before Congress, in order that they might judge for themselves and assure you that many Members differ from the Honorable Commissioners & did not seem to think that he ought to be Immediately removed from his Cornmercial employment. These Same Gentn from Nantes inform me, that that employment is sought for by others whom the Commissioners wish to gratify at his Expense. That Mr. Williams & others envie him &: that Relatives & Interested motives are united to remove my Brother to make way, for a Nephew, a Couzin & a Partner. I am not fond of believing these storys and yet there are many Circumstances related with them, that stagger my want of faith. How  ever the principal foundation for me to Act Upon is wanting. If my Brothers conduct had been such as to inspire me w ith perfect Confidence, all the Commissioners at Paris shou' d not remove him. But as he has not done that, I had rather any mans Nephew, Couzin or Partner had the Employment, than that my Brother shou'd give just cause for a single complaint. Therefore if you have removed him I shall acquiesce & trouble you nor myself any farther about the matter, and having no views or designs but what I can justify you see I dont hide from you my Sentiments on any one point, but you will enter into the distinction I make, & think yourself justly entitled to my thanks for the accounts given to myself of this same Troublesome Brother of mine & I shall ever acknowledge that favour. I anxiously wish to hear what you did with him in consequence of my letter by Capt Bell for untill I know that or learn what has been his line of Conduct since that time, I am & shall be much embarrassed how to direct the affairs that have been Committed to his management.  I wou'd wish to indulge the Fond hope that he will see his Folly with an Eye of judgement and take up another Conduct that will give him Character & Consequence in the World, on these terms & no other do I wish to serve him, and I do assure you upon my honor if your letters respecting him had been confined to myself, instead of being offended, you wou'd have experienced the most unbounded acknowledgements & the most gratefull returns for your Candour & even now I shall not suffer the feelings occasioned by the Public letters to stifle what is due to You for the pains you did take to put him right. And now for the Commercial affairs depending between us. I am not surprized that my Brothers Conduct in London shou'd have hurt the reputation & Credit of our House because a good deal of pains had been taken & even ministerial influences used (as I am well informed) to do that previous to his arrival & there is no doubt but his irregularities furnished fresh materials. However I disregard all this as I shall honorably fullfill all my engagements in that Country & wish I cou'd say that every one there had done so by me. But probably the day may come when some that rank high in the Commercial World may blush at the Recital of their Conduct. You say the American Credit, both Public & private was in a most Wretched state. I doubt it not in the least, indeed I always expected it wou'd be so, and am now as well as then convinced that General Washington must be the Great Banker to establish our Credit with the Banks & Bankers of Europe and this I believe he will be able to do, at least appearances are more favourable now than ever and I have not despaired at any time.  You tell me you have engaged on your & my Account One hundred thousand Livers interest in the Cargo by the Union, Capt. L. Roche, Consigned to Mr Bromfield for which remittances must be punctually made. This Vessell is arrived safe at Charles Town in South Carolina  JUNE 29, l777  where the Captain was selling the Cargo at a considerable advance. Mr Bromfield left that Ship at Cape Francois & came to Virginia in a small Sloop from whence he set out by Land for Carolina. You seem to rely much on this Gentlemans prudence but I have Conceived a very indifferent opinion of it, for he has not only done what I have already mentioned respecting my Brother, but he has told to every body the Concern you & I had in the Union Cargo with many circumstances that I know little about. Colo Harrison who happened to be in Virginia when he arrived says all the People in that Country are acquainted with the whole Concern & from hence it is not improbable but they may conjecture by & by that private gain is more our pursuit than public good, for such unworthy suspicions are frequently taken upon less grounds. However I shall continue to discharge my duty faithfully to the Public & pursue my private Fortune by all such honorable & fair means as the times will admit of and I dare sav you will do the Same, but we are not much indebted to Mr Bromfields discretion. Neither can I think myself under any great obligation for a Credit so limited & guarded as this Cargo by the Union seems to be. Capt. La Roche writes for my opinion & advice but takes care to let me know, he is to remit the entire Net proceeds to his owner Monsr La Ray du Chaumont. Now altho I have no real objection to his doing so, yet it carries an air of distrust that I dislike. Enclosed you will find copies of what I wrote to Mr Bromfield in answer to his letter from Virginia before I knew how very communicative he was, also Copy of which I wrote Capt La Roche by which you'l see I offer to pay him for your & my part the Cost of the Cargo in Good Bills of Exchange and receive our share of the Net Proceeds, rather than consent to his shipping back Indico on our account.(5) That article is very dear & I know must entail a heavy loss on us, whereas if the remittances are confined to Rice, Tobacco, Furrs, Skins, Flour &c a handsome proffit will result from what does arrive safe and if he will wait to make returns in these articles I have no objection to the whole going back as I have no inclination on occasion to finger any of the money arising from the sales of this Cargo, therefore it was quite unnecessary to be so guarded against its coming into my hands. In short I shall rest satisfyed with this Concern because I have run my share of the Risque but there is a certain degree of Indignity in the terms that I will not submit to again, to hold an Interest in a Cargo addressed to a Captain & Super Cargo with orders for them to have the sole Management, receive the commission & remit the entire Net Proceeds back, so that had they come here I must have had the trouble, been their adviser & looked on whilst she carried back any share to France altho' I was ready to pay down the Cost.  This will never do, and I desire not any further Concern on such terms, therefore I will not give you any more trouble about interesting me in Commercial matters, in what is done on our joint account previous to the receipt of this letter I hold myself bound and will make good  my part of the engagements but I suppose this Cargo by the Union will be the only one shipped. If Capt Roche accepts my offer & delivers up your proportions & mine of the Net proceeds on my paying him Good bills for Livres 100,000 I will comply with it & in that case the surplus or Proffit on your share shall be remitted to Mrs. Deane as you direct. On the Contrary if the entire returns for this Cargo are made to France you will see the Final Settlement of the account and I beg that my share of the Proffits may be paid to Mr John Ross of this City, now in Europe whose address you will be acquainted with no doubt & shou'd the remittances from America be taken or fail of making entire payment for the first Cost of the Union Cargo I will desire Mr Ross in such case to pay whatever ballance may become due on the proportion of Livres 50,000.  Notwithstanding what I have said above respecting future concerns, I shou'd have no objection provided they were to come on such a footing as is consistant with that Credit and Character I am entitled to but on no other The Cargoes shou'd be consigned to me or my order & the Captains be directed to get into the first safe Port they can make. I have the best Correspondants at every port on this Continent who can sell the Cargoes & make remittances to much better advantage than any Super Cargoes for these always do much mischief to Trade in general as well as to their own particular Voyages. Goods continue in great demand & if Insurances cou'd be obtained in Europe great Fortunes might be made with Certainty. On the above terms I am willing to be further concerned but not on any others.  Your letter of the 3d Decr. to Messrs. Alsop, Livingston, Lewis & myself (6) came also by Monsr. duCoudray, & I need only tell you in answer that many Vessells were taken of those loaded for acct of that Contract & General Washington unloaded several that were loaden in New York for the same purpose. Therefore it appeared evidently you never cou'd receive the remittance of £40,000 Stg from the Money's allotted to make you that remittance & for this reason the ballance that remained was thrown back into the Secret Committee & they gave orders to the Commercial Agents to supply you with what you fell short of the £40,000 Stg after you had received all the remittances the Contractors had made you. This was putting you on the surest footing because the Committee keep Constantly Shipping & the Contractors cou'd only have gone to the end of the money advanced one half of which had been stopped early by Friends & Foes as already mentioned.  We are so Cursedly hampered with their Numerous Cruizers along our Coast, that remittances are precarious & very difficult to be got out. Therefore I hope you will negotiate Loans of Money in Europe on such terms as will give us time to look around & make Remittances to the best advantage & with the greatest security that can be. However I must  JUNE 30, 1777  refer you to public letters for this & other Subjects being Dr sir, Your Obedt hble servt. Robt Morris ""

  Dear Sir Philade June 30 1777. I have the pleasure of receiving your friendly Letter of the 16th Instant,(1) and have little more than time enough barely to acknowledge it. There is an unaccountable Uncertainty in the conducting the Post office. About a month ago I remonstrated to the Post Master General that the Time allowd the Eastern Delegates to answer the Letters they receivd (being on the Monday between the Hours of 9 & 2) was altogether spent in Congress, and requested that we might have one Evening for the purpose. He granted it and the Post has been since detaind till Tuesday Morning. But I am now informed that the former Regulation is revivd, for what Reason I know not, and our Letters must be ready at two o'Clock. I do assure you I should hardly forgive my self, if I could reflect upon my having once neglected to write to so valuable a Friend as you.  You wish to hear \""how our Confederation goes on.\"" I do not wonder at your Anxiety to have it completed, for it appears to me to be a Matter of very great Importance. We every now and then take it into Consideration, but such a Variety of Affairs have demanded the Attention of Congress, that it has been impracticable hitherto to get it through. There are but two or three things which in my opinion will be the Subjects of further Debate, and upon these I believe most if not all the Members have already made up their Minds. One is, what Share of Votes each of the States which differ so much in Wealth and Numbers shall have in determining all Ouestions. Much has been said upon this weighty Subject, upon the Decision of which depends the Union of the States and the Security of the Liberty of the whole. Perhaps it would be more easy for a disinterested Foreigner to see, than for the JUNE 30, 1777  united States to fix upon the Principles on which this Question ought in Equity to be decided. The Sentiments in Congress are not various, but, as you will easily conceive, opposite. The Question was very largely debated a few days ago, and I am apt to think it will be tomorrow determind that each State shall have one Vote, but that certain great and very interesting Questions shall have the concurrent Votes of nine States for a Decision. Whether this Composition will go near towards the Preservation of a due Ballance, I wish you to consider, for if your Life and Health is spared to your Country you will have a great Share in the Determination of it hereafter.  You have Advices from abroad later than ours. Our last Intelligence I gave you pretty minutely in a Letter which I sent & suppose was deliverd to you by Cap Collins.(2)  I find by the Newspapers that the General Assembly under the Denomination of a Convention are forming a new Constitution. This is a momentous Business; I pray God to direct you! Shall I be favord with your own and others Sentiments upon it. I am greatly afflicted to find that angry Disputes have arisen among my dear Countrymen, at a time especially when perfect good Harmony should subsist and every Heart and Tongue and Hand shd unite in promoting the Establishment of publick Liberty and securing the future Safety and Happiness of our Country. I am sure you will cultivate Harmony among those who love the Country in Sincerity.

  My dear sir Philadelphia June 30th 1777 Your agreable Favours of the 10th, 15th & l9th of June with the Inclosures are at Hand,(1) & the Goods shipped by Messrs Gardoqui onboard the Charlotte, Capt St Clair, & the Alexander, Capt John Williamson, & consigned to you for my Acct are the property of the Continent; in Consequence of which I shall desire the Secret Committee to take the Charge thereof to order payment of the Freight prem[iu]m & other Expences by you incurred, & for your services herein.  Messrs Gardoquis mentioned in their Letter a parcell of Duck which they for some Time before had shipped by Capt Hodges for my private Acct., it being now appropriated to answer an Order which they have recd from the Hona Mr Lee in behalf of the united States. I am much at a Loss to understand their Intention, or to know upon what principles or Misconception they have made the proposal. You may remember that I purchasd in Novr last 3 Cargoes of Fish to import military stores & intended that the Contt or the State of Massa Bay should have the Benefit thereof & take the Cargoes on their own Acct.(2) As the latter had been greatly drained of Arms & other Stores, & could not so easily JUNE 30, 1777  come at Imports as the Commissioners employed by Congress to purchase for the Continent, I thot it necessary to offer them to the Board of War, & finally concluded to risque with the Board half the Cargoes on my own Acct. They enquired into the quality of the Cargoes & finding them inferior declined to be concerned, & before I was apprized thereof, I recd Advises that one of the vessels wch afterwards proved to have been captured by the Enemy, was a long time out & not arrived at Bilbao. In Consequence of this I declined offering the Cargoes to the Continent or any Individual as it would be in Fact an unequal proposal, & therefore risqued the whole in my own Acct. Two of the Cargoes arrived & Mess Gardoquis not being able to procure Fire arms, Lead & Flints, without breaking the strictest Injunctions of the Court of Madrid, procured 16 Bales of Duck which they mention & shipped them by Capt Hodges who was altogether in my Service, specifying particularly that the Reason of their doing this was that he could not procure for me the other Articles mentioned. The first cost of the Fish which he recd of mine was abt £2200 ster. & bad as the Quality was it must neat near 3/4 of that Sum. The Whole Amo[unt] of what he has shippd for my Acct including the 16 or 17 Bales of Duck is abt £700 sterl., so that he must Now have about 9 or 1000£ sterl. of mine in his Hands, therefore it was not from want of Interest of mine that he proposed to make the new Appropriation. In addition to this, the Vessel had sailed from Bilbao near one Month, all which Time the risque was mine, before he made the proposal, & had she been taken & carryed in to any port of France or Spain It must have been known & the loss would have been mine. She is also arrived & the Goods disposed off for my acct without the most distant Expectations of any Embarrassment in the affair. I have been thus particular, that You may hereafter if occasion should require explain the Matter, as I prefer any Loss to the least Misunderstanding with the public relative to Interest; & altho I shall not neat above one half in Bilbao of what the 3 Cargoes cost here without charging any Insurance, yet I will consent to lose the Duck including the Cost of it, should it be desired by any public Authority whatever.  I shall probably have occasion to obtain the Notary's Seal to some papers for recoverg abt £250 strg which Messrs Gardoquis inform me another House in Bilbao Messrs Lynch & Co who owe me the Money refuse to pay because I sent back Bills of Exchange for the Money here, which they sent after I had ordered my Interest to be there kept & invested in produce. This is something extra in the commercial World, & I shall probably trouble you for the purposes mentioned & to teach these merchants that they are in an Error.  ""

I had intended to write a letter to you on this day somewhat minutely about our in-door political turns & twists, but I am too ill. 4 Engineers having arrived on a Treaty with Messrs Franklin & Deane find the former one made between Deane and Du Coudray intirely inconsistent with their Honor; and they have made it appear that D was only a child in the hands of Du Coudray, who has united, as under one direction, the Engineers & Artillerists; and made a Jews bargain for himself, and all the officers with him.(1)  These contending endless talkers and writers have entirely destroyed me I suspect a settled fit of sickness will be [the] end of my present confinement If I am mistaken, you shall soon hear again from, Yr. real Friend & humble Servt.

  Honord Sir, Philadelphia June 30th. 1777 I have nothing to communicate, save my Wishes That the Order of JUNE 30, 1777  the Genl. Assembly may be duely complyd with, which appointed a Committee to correspond with Their Delegates, & to transmit immediately after every Session of the General Assembly Abstracts of their Proceedings, and a General State of their Affairs. I should be glad to know the Numbers of the Contl. Troops raised, and how many are sent forward, The Numbers of Militia in the Field, The Force and Shiping of the Enemy. I could wish That Our State may if possible early take Measures to import next fall cloths, Linnens, Hats, & Stockings, at least sufficient for Our Proportion of Continental Troops, & such as we may think necessary to keep in the Field for Our own immediate Defence. For altho' Congress take every Measure in their power for clothing the whole, yet if we do it ourselves, we shall then have the Satisfaction of knowing That our Troops are provided for, and we shall have their Blessings. I could wish that Our State would see it Their Interest to fit out one or two State Brigs. The Expence might most probably be doubly paid to Them in One Cruise. I cannot think The Hazard of Loosing them ought to discourage the Attempt, if They could be got out of the River when fitted. Might They not be ventured out only in a set of Ballast with a few Hands and sent round to Bedford and fitted out from thence?  I venture Sir at Suggestion from an Attachment to the Honor, Interest & Happiness of the State-Should they not meet with Approbation I know their Candour will excuse Relying upon that upon all occasions I shall unremittingly endeavour to convince Them of my Zeal for their Service, And you Sir, that I am with great Truth & Sincerity, your most obed, humble Servt, H Marchant  ""

  Sir Philadelphia June 1777(1) Recieved your kind favour of the 22nd Instant. Had then but just arrived in Town put up at the Indian King while we could look out for Lodgings which I find dificult to find such as is agreable but have now concluded to take chambers at the same house I Used to live in kept by Mrs. House in Lodge Alley but now kept by Mrs Sword, Coll Williams & Mr. Low [Law] with me. I desired Mr Root to Inform you very particularly that Mrs Trumbull is well, the rest of the family as usual.(2) Coll Thos.(3) has for some few days before I left home been a little regaining as to his health was determined to set off for the Army soon. Of your New Appointment I have been Informed by Mr. Sherman, and of the salary or Wages allowd you. I think you will have much less Trouble more leisure or rather time to Visit your Friends than  JUNE 30, 1777  when at the head of the Issuing part, how far your Wages will as now fixed answer or exceed your Expences I cannot determine, but am rather of Opinion and so is Coll Williams, Mr Low & Mr Sherman that unless you must by serving fall in the rear you had better Accept your Appointment.(4) We think the Country requires your service & the cause may suffer by your refusal, we therefore rather advise you on the whole to accept. I am very Solicitous for Mr Root, not to serve him, but my Country by his service. I may possibly be prejudiced in his favour, but I really think he will make one of the most distinguished Officers from Connecticut, after a little more experience even as a Genl Officer. There is a Vacancy of a Coll in late Coll Huntingtons Regt. & Douglass one of which Vacancys he ought to fill if the real good of the service & the Country is Attended to.(5) At first it will be dissagreable to some & so it will if any other Gentn. whoever shall be Appointed but matters will soon quieted and all reconciled. Root has an Excellent Talent that way, the Regiments & Officers will soon respect & Esteem him. I know the best Gentn. in the Colony & whose Judgment is most to be depended upon wish him to fill one of those Vacancys. I dare say he would have been appointed by Govr & Councill of Safety (before the New Election) but no official Account of Coll Huntingtons advancement had arrived till too late. Part of the Regiment was Marched forward & it was then doubted whether we had Authority to fill up the Vacancy, but rather concluded it belonged to Genll Washington. If that is the Case how shall Genll Washington be Acquainted with what is really best for the publick service. I know he would make the greatest good his Motive Am sure & he may depend upon it, Coll Root will be preferable to any other appointment, which is the least probable may be made from that State. I only wish Genll Washington to know it. I dare pawn all my honor & Judgment upon it. I wish Genll Washington to know what can be known & doubt not of the Wisdome & rectitude of his decision. I do not my self love to trouble him with a letter, I know his cares, his Attention, & burthens in some measure, he has doubtless many Applications. Perhaps he may know my Sentiments from you or by reading him a few lines from this letter as am loath to Trouble him with one but if you think best will write him on the Subject.  Many New faces in Congress tho but about half or little more of their full Numbers. Let me hear from you as often as Convenient & am sincerely yours, Elipht Dyer  [P.S.] I had forgot to Mention to you the affair of son Oliver. He had set out with John Fitch for Fishkill or there about before I receivd your letter. Am at a loss what is best to be done with him.

  JULY 1 [1777]Tuesday Yesterday the Committee of the whole House finished their Proceedings concerning our Revolters and reported them to the House. An unexpected Field of Debate was open'd and some of our neighbors (R.S .(1) in particular) discoverd an Earnestness and Sollicitude that did not belong to a Judge between a State and it's discontented members. But it was of little avail to object to what had been agreed to by the Committee of the whole House on the most solemn Argument and Debate of which I have been witness. The enclosd Resolutions were finally agreed to by Congress The two first unanimously, all the rest by a considerable Majority. What was most keenly opposd is the last Resolution respecting Young's address; because it brought all the preceeding home more pointedly to the Case of New York.(2)  This appears to us to be a happy Decision for our State which if not neglected must produce very salutary Consequences. I shoud think it ought to be instantly circulated by handbills throughout every part of the State; and that Commissioners shoud be sent into the three Counties to announce the Resolutions and induce the People to conform to the new Government and avail themselves of its Blessings. We did not think it necessary to press for a Recommendation of Congress to these people to submit to our Jurisdiction; nor for the dismission of Warner's Regiment. We thought we had obtained what was sufficient for the present. It will depend on the Impression these important Decisions may make on that Regiment & the disaffected at large, whether the former shall be dischargd; & the latter enjoind more directly to a peaceble Conduct. If either shoud be turbulent and be guilty of Acts of Violence or Hostility I presume on proper Application Congress will interpose. A motion came from the southward that the power of the Continent shoud be employd to suppress these Insergents. Another from the same Quarter that Warner's Regiment shoud be dismissed: but it woud not have been wise to hazard either of them; & a spirit of candour & moderation, which on this occasion distinguishd your Delegates, was of no little Service in the other Points which after the first Debate we saw the finest prospect of obtaining. As I said before these Requisitions are kept in Reserve for a proper Season if they shoud become essential. I beleive the fine Politicians who have workt up this System of Independance have quite enough to digest. It was offensive to Congress in the highest Degree. If I have time I will send you a Copy of these Resolutions by this Conveyance: they go to the Council of Safety.  This is a very incorrect Letter. I wish it was transcribed; but have no Leisure to attempt it. If you think any part of it worth communicating shew it to Jay, Yates, Morris or any other of our Friends, and particularly to my Father in Law whom I hope you sometimes visit. JULY 1,1777  My Compliments to all I ought to respect, particularly to your Lady, Mamma and Sisters, and believe me to be, with the utmost Regard, Dear Sir, Your affectionate Friend & most Obed Servant,  Jas. Duane July 2d. Wednesday I have still an opportunity before I close this Letter to inform you that by the latest Intelligence from General Washington the Enemy again appear to be retiring from New Jersey; whether with Intention to embark for the Delaware or for Hudson's River, or on any other Enterprize, is so uncertain that the General himself does not hazard a Conjecture, & considering what has passed within the time I began this Letter you will allow that it is no easy matter to measure the Depths of Genl Howe's maneuvres. If he means to draw half our Army into an Engagement against the whole of his, he must be disappointed, for General Washington is not to be deluded by these thin disguises; & I am perswaded never will give up the Advantage of his strong Ground 'till he is convincd of Success from the Superiority of his Forces, or other very favourable Circumstances.  We have now finished every thing in Congress which immediately concerns our State, & I own I feel no small satisfaction in contemplating our Success. I wish our Countrymen may be as well pleased; & I shall have for a great deal of pains and Labour & anxiety a full Reward. I ought to have excepted as an unfinished business our publick accounts with the united States. To this my attention shall now be directed. Adieu! J.D.  Once more Verte.(3)  ""

Washingtons Letter, of the 28th will inform You of the Transactions in the Jersies since my last to you.(1) We do not exactly know the Enemies Strength in the Jersies. They have called in all their Outposts & have left but weak Garrisons in N York & Long Island. I apprehend Howe may have in all about 15,000, but these will moulder away by daily Skirmishes, desertion & fatigue, unless he can force our General to a Battle, & Should come off Conqueror. I fear the Loss of our three field pieces was owing to Surprise. Was i t not  JULY 2, 1777  shameful to be surprised when the Enemy were within 8 Miles ? Nothing but Severity will introduce Discipline into our Armies, and dear bought Experience only can convince our officers & Men of its Utility, nay of its absolute Necessity. Mr. Duer a Delegate from N York informs Me that an intelligent person arrived yesterday in Town from Peaks Kill acquainted him, that the obstructions in the High Lands are in great forwardness & that the Enemy should they attempt that passage, will meet with a most vigorous Resistance. I wish our Situation at Ty. may be as respectable; I expect great Matters from the Influence, Conduct & Activity of Schuyler, and from the military Knowledge of St. Clair, who commands at that post. Four French Engineers arrived here last Week engaged by our Agents in France by the Direction of Congress. They refuse to serve under de Coudray.

  Sir Philadelphia, 2d July 1777  I am extremely sorry that the circumstance of affairs & Gen Howe's unreasonable demands have hitherto prevented the final settlement of the Cartel for a general exchange of prisoners. I flattered myself when I had the honour of waiting upon your Excellency in March last at Morris Town, on account of my Brother-in-Law John Gibbon, who has long been a prisoner of war in New York, that this matter would, before now, have been fairly compromised, & our prisoners released from their barbarous confinement. At present I see no prospect of so desirable an event taking place. I am therefore, at the earnest request of Mr. Gibbon's wife, under the necessity of mentioning his name once more to you, & of earnestly solliciting your Excellency, if possible, to procure his exchange or releasement upon parole. If no favourable opportunity is like to offer for accomplishing either of these ends, would it be inconvenient for you to admit his wife & some one of his friends to go to New York to see him, & carry him cloaths & other necessaries? He must undoubtedly stand in great need of them as he has been a prisoner upwards of six months.  If Mr. Gibbon cannot be released upon any other terms, his wife begs me to acquaint you that she has engaged a man to go & remain a prisoner in his room, until an exchange can be effected. This to me is a new expedient, of which I can form no Judgment at present. If your Excellency conceives it probable that such a thing could take place, or any other more eligible mode of relief adopted, Should esteem it a singular favour to be speedily informed of it.  I have the honour to be, Your Excellency's most obedient & very Hble Servant, Jonathn. Elmer  ""

  Honourable Gentlemen, Philadelphia, 2d July, 1777. Since our last we have applied to Commissary Trumbull to exchange in the manner directed by Congress the 2,000 bushels of salt which they were pleased to grant for the relief of our State; as soon as we receive his answer you shall know the result. We are endeavouring to purchase further quantities of this necessary article for the use of our fellow citizens, and have a prospect of succeeding.  The manufacturing of salt in the interior parts of our own State is certainly an object most worthy of the attention of the public. The Indians far from being averse to it, seem heartily disposed to favour the design, and by being made partakers of the advantages, might become warmly engaged for its success.  If the war should be prolonged, it is far from being improbable that we may be deprived of all foreign supplies. How necessary then may this expedient prove to our comfortable subsistence and to our internal union and repose ?  We hope to hear that the experiments which were directed before we left Kingston have proved favourable, as well as that good progress has been made in the manufacture of lead and flints, and the refining of sulphur. A certain prospect of internal supply of these important articles would give Congress singular satisfaction; and if derived from your researches and exertions, would add highly to the reputation of the State.  We were yesterday honoured with your favour of the and immediately took the necessary steps to procure an account of the State prisoners sent to Philadelphia by our late Convention, and of the manner of their discharge.(1) It shall be transmitted to you by this conveyance, with the reasons which induced the Council of Safety of this Commonwealth to use so little ceremony in a business which had been represented to them as of a very serious nature.  Congress, between this and the 26th of June, have spent the greatest part of four days in considering the claim of some of the inhabitants of our State to a new government, independent of the community, and the letters and remonstrances of our late Convention and your Honourable Council, on that interesting subject. The principles upon which this ambitious project was granted, were admitted to be of universal concern to the general confederacy; and they were considered as particularly odious, from the attempt to confirm them by the grossest misrepresentation of the resolutions of Congress. No debate was ever conducted with more deliberation and solemnity, and the decision was such as, in our judgment, ought, for the present, to be satisfactory; it does  JULY 2, 1777  not, it is true, come up to the requisition of our State, \""that the insurgents should be recommended to a peaceable submission to its jurisdiction by the authority of Congress, and that Warner's regiment should be discharged.\"" But by totally reprobating the idea that a minority can establish an independence of the community of which they are members, by proclaiming the duty of Congress to secure and defend the several communities of which it is composed:  By censuring the supposition that Congress could do, recommend or countenance any thing injurious to the rights and jurisdictions of those communities:  By declaring expressly that the independent government attempted to be established by those misguided people, can derive no countenance or justification from the particular resolution on which it is pretended to be founded, or from any other act or proceeding of Congress:  By the contemptuous rejection of their petition to be received and ranked as a free State, and to be represented by their own Delegates in Congress:  By the apology to the State of New-York for raising Warner's regiment, implied in the explanation of the motives which gave rise to it, and by the severe censure of Doct. Young's address, encouraging those people to persevere in their defection:  By all these different resolutions, we think a substantial foundation, on general and undeniable principles, is laid, either for reclaiming our fellow citizens to their duty and a submission to the laws, by the force of reason and persuasion, and the fears of offending a whole continent; or should they obstinately persevere in their revolt, for a future requisition of the aid of Congress, to be administered in such manner as the opposition of the disaffected, and our own circumstances, may render expedient.  We flatter ourselves, therefore, that we shall meet with your approbation, and that our country will be pleased and benefitted by the measures adopted on this occasion. May we be permitted to suggest the propriety of despatching commissioners, without delay, to explain and enforce, among our too aspiring countrymen, these resolutions of Congress, and to seize the advantage which the first impression of unexpected disappointment and condemnation from the only tribunal they fear, may make on their minds, in order to induce them to a submission of your jurisdiction.  This appears to us to be the more necessary, as Mr. Roger Sherman, of Connecticut, who brought in the petition for these people to Congress, and has all along acted openly as their advocate and patron, and in the last debate plead their cause with a zeal and passion which he never discovered in any other instance, and which, in a judge, between a State and some of its own members, was far from being commendable. This gentleman, we say, immediately on passing the resolutions,(2)  procured copies, and having obtained leave of absence, is already set out on his journey to the eastward. What may be his views with respect to our dispute, we know not, but to his enmity and officiousness you ought not to be strangers.

  My dear General Philada. 3d July 1777 Doctor McKenzie sets out for Ticonderoga. I embrace, with Pleasure, the Opportunity of writing to you by him.  Some Time ago, the Enemy advanced from Brunswick as far as Somerset Court House. It is probable that their Design was to push for Philadelphia. This, at least, was believed; and the Belief produced the best Effects. The Militia of New Jersey turned out with the greatest Rapidity; and to a Man The Citizens of Philadelphia agreed to suspend their Disputes about the Constitution and to join unanimously in every Measure proper for repelling the Enemy and defending the State. General Washington kept his strong Encampment at Middle Brook. The Body under General Sullivan, consisting of Militia and Reinforcements of Continental Troops from the Southward, was increasing very fast at Correll's Ferry. General Howe thought it proper to retire from Somerset to Brunswick, from Brunswick to Amboy; and lately from Amboy to Staten Island. These different Movements have produced frequent Skirmishes, with the Advantage generally on our Side; once on that of the Enemy, so far as gaining three Field Pieces from us and losing, according to the best Accounts, a much greater Number of Men than we lost, can be called an Advantage. Concerning the future Views of the Enemy, the Sentiments expressed here are very different. Some think they mean to push up the North River: others, that they will make an Irruption into New-England; others, that they will come round by Sea to Delaware; others, that they know not what to do. Indeed I think it probable that their Plan for the Campaign, if they had a Plan, is very considerably deranged. We hear of no Reinforcements worth mentioning being arrived from Europe.  As to the Politics of Pennsylvania-they are not in the Situation I would wish. If a regular System were formed between General Howe and the Friends of our Constitution, his Motions could not have been better timed for them than they have been in two different Instances. When an Opposition has been twice set on Foot; and has twice proceeded so far as to become formidable; He has twice by his Marches towards Delaware procured a Cessation. The Assembly have twice taken Advantage of it to promote their own Purposes. Though those in the Opposition generously, and like true Patriots, suspended it while the Approaches of the Enemy were dreaded; the Assembly, just before their Adjournment, and just after this laudable Instance of Conduct was exhibited, have branded them, in a public Address to the People, with carrying on their Opposition in a Manner improper under any Government. They have agreed, however, at last, to take the Sentiments of the People with Regard to a Convention. What will be the Event, I am uncertain. They have one useful Quality. It would be a Virtue if exerted JULY 3, 1777  for a good Purpose. I mean Industry. This is much wanted on the other Side. As the Sense of the People will not be taken till after the next Election, I have some Expectation that their Eyes may be opened to see their true Interest by that Time.  I long much to hear from you. What I intimated to you long ago has happened. I hope you will be happy. I know you will be useful, at Ticonderoga A good correspondence, I have every Reason to believe, will subsist between General Schuyler and you. If he is at Ticonderoga, please to present my Compliments to him. I am, Dear Sir, Yours very sincerely, James Wilson  ""

  My dear Friend Philade July 4 1777 I did myself the Honor to write to you on the 2d of Jany past since which your favor of the 21st of the same Month from Paris came to my Hand.(1) You have supposd that this Campaign would put General Howe, after the Junction with Burgoyne in Possession of the States of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania & the Delaware with Rhode Island as his Center of Attack upon the States of New England; you have even considerd such a situation of things as almost certain. But I have now the satisfaction of informing you that General Howe has found it necessary to withdraw all his Troops from New Jersey, and I am of opinion that it is impracticable for him to distribute his Troops among the States you have mentioned in sufficient Numbers to keep possession of them and afford enough to attack the New England States with the least Prospect of subduing them. I have thought that the Impression which the Enemy made the last Winter in the State of New Jersey was owing to favorable Circumstances which then took place, and was not in pursuance of the original Plan. The Time for which our Troops were inlisted had expired, our Army was reduced to a mere handful and General Howe had flatterd himself that the middle States were so generally disaffected to our Cause as to render their total Submission practicable & easy. He therefore made a vigorous push in the Depth of Winter as far as Trenton upon Delaware, and there cantond his Troops with a Design probably of availing himself of this City early in the Spring before we should be able to collect a force sufficient to prevent it. But General Washington, having gaind a signal Advantage by an attack as you have heard obligd him to retreat and make his remaining Winter Quarters in Brunswick; since which the Vigilance & Activity of the people of Jersey who by frequent Skirmishes have lessend his Army, has given him Reason to alter his opinion of their disposition & his removing from  JULY 4, 1777  thence has I think afforded sufficient Proof that he has not been able by Arts or Arms to conquer even one of our smaller States. What his next step will be is uncertain, perhaps he may embark his troops for Philadelphia, or more probably he may attempt a Junction with Burgoyne. If the first, has he to expect more Laurels or better Success than he gaind in Jersey? or, if the latter should be his Choice judge what must be his Prospect. Burgoyne who it is said can not muster more than 7 or 8 thousand will be opposd by our Northern Army & I hope overwhelmd before they approach Albany. How will be followd close by the Army under the immediate Command of G W, at present more than equal in number, in high Spirits, full of the Idea of Victory and daily increasing Under these unpromising circumstances should he ever complete a Junction, he will then have to begin an attempt of the most arduous Business of conquering the whole Army of the united States together with the numerous, hardy & stubborn Militia of New England. These are my Views of the present State of our military affairs and I am perswaded, when I reflect on the Spirit & Valor discoverd in my Countrymen of Georgia, So & No Carolina, Virginia & Jersey to say nothing of Lexington & Bunker Hill in my own dear native State, Great Britain will ever show herself feeble in her Efforts to conquer America. I beg you to write to me full as often as you can find Leisure, and for my own part I feel a disposition almost to persecute you with my letters but I must conclude with congratulating you on the first Anniversary of American Independence and assuring you that I am unfeignedly and very affectionately, your Friend, S A  ""

  4th July A.M. 7 o'clock. We had yesterday advices from Gen. St. Clair, who commands at Tionderoga, as low down as the 26th ultimo.(1) The Enemy were approaching: their fleet was on the lake, part of it at Crown Point, but uncertain whether they had landed any forces there. They had landed Some on Chimney point opposite to Crown Point They had an encampment at Gilliland's Creek 45 miles below Crown Point: several of our People have been killed or taken by small parties of Indians within a very small distance of our lines at Tionderoga. Our garrison is weak, not exceeding 2500 effectives: however if they defend themselves well, time may be given to collect a force sufficient to prevent the place from falling into the enemy's hands, but the garrison is badly armed & cloathed.

  Hond. and dear Sir [ante JULY 4, 1777](1) I catch up my pen in haste: but, it is not that circumstance which makes me omit prefatorial apology, in this attempt to draw You into a literary correspondence. Difference of age and other differences vastly more important vanish, when I consider our relationship as \""Friends to America.\"" And, I am conscious that the service of these United States is the only motive prompting me at this time to an act, otherwise, egregiously vain.  Letters to Congress have been too often cast into the sea by the bearers of them, when in danger of being taken by the Enemy, in consequence of directions given by the Writers. The last unfortunate in- JULY 4, 1777  stance was where Mr. McCreary was bearer for the Honble. Mr. Deane. I think the great ingenuity of that young Gentleman could have found means to preserve a packet in the chase & his after captivity, if he had been emboldened by any consideration to make tryal, under contrary orders. I wish to lessen the necessity of such directions as have been heretofore given on like occasions.  You have practised modes of secret correspondence. I submit the annexed plan to your judgment. Having gained it by accident, I am satisfied myself that it is sufficiently inscrutable to warrant the attempt of preserving packets of importance thro' the risques of captivity.(2)  Should this letter arrive unbroken in its seal; we may draw advantage from the Thistle.(3) Should it arrive under dubious circumstances, you may use the Alphabet, and, by one of your ten thousand ready devices, may communicate to me a new Key-Word.  The secret Committee doubtless give you all proper history. I am too young in my present service to know the just limits of communicating those subjects which are most interesting to your Heart.

  Sr Philada. July 4th 1777 I think it my duty as an Individual to communicate some Information to you which you may not perhaps receive in a more formal or authorative way. The Contracts made with the Chevalr. De Borre, Mr. Du Coudray and several more have given infinite trouble, being inconsistent with each other, and all of them, except the one You signed with 4 Engineers, inconsistent with the honor of our American Officers, who, tho' not formed in regular standing Armies, have the most just claims from their services since the war began. It is not to be doubted but that a multitude of foreign Officers, by no means deficient of merit, are willing to come over & supersede such of ours as have been constantly in the field, and have borne innumerable hardships, when our poverty in Arms & Amunition would have terrified the stoutest European who had been accustomed to systematic Campaigns. Though we have now a standing Army for 3 Years or during the War, yet the Genius of the people of these United States is far from relishing this monarchical production: So far, at least, as not to be willing, for the sake of Theory, to have Foreigners placed in the highest trusts.  JULY 5, 1777  The Merit of Br. Genl. Knox is great, and he is beloved by his Corps. How then could it be conceived that Mr. Du Coudrays treaty should not create the greatest confusion among our Officers of Artillery? But these are not the only ones disgusted. Numbers of our Major Generals are injured by an antidate. The 4 Engineers who have arrived this Week disavow in the most preremptory manner being under the Command of Mr. Du Coudray who is not of the royal Corps of Engineers. Nor is it usual or convenient that those two Parties should be under the same Guidance.  Mr. De la Balme may be Inspector Genl of Cavalry without umbrage given to any of that Corps.  B. Genl Conway resigns upon finding De Borre ranking above him. The first might be ten thousand times more useful to us than the last. Mr. Holzendorf is a fresh Embarrassment in all respects.  I much fear that an Instruction, formerly passed in Congress respecting Foreigners who do not understand our language will be construed as a patent for those who do. It was not intended for that end I assure you. Nothing is more dreaded than such a Construction.(1)  I will not multiply words, but conclude by assuring you of my most sincere Esteem as, Sr., Your Friend & very humble Servant,  James Lovell ""

  My dear Daughter Philadelphia, July 5th, 1777 Yesterday, being the anniversary of American Independence, was celebrated here with a festivity and ceremony becoming the occasion.  I am too old to delight in pretty descriptions, if I had a talent for them, otherwise a picture might be drawn, which would please the fancy of a Whig, at least.  The thought of taking any notice of this day, was not conceived, until the second of this month, and it was not mentioned until the third. It was too late to have a sermon, as every one wished, so this must be deferred another year.  Congress determined to adjourn over that day, and to dine together. The general officers and others in town were invited, after the President and Council, and Board of War of this State JULY 5, 1777  In the morning the Delaware frigate, several large gallies, and other continental armed vessels, the Pennsylvania ship and row gallies and guard boats, were all hawled off in the river, and several of them beautifully dressed in the colours of all nations, displayed about upon the masts, yards, and rigging.  At one o'clock the ships were all manned, that is, the men were all ordered aloft, and arranged upon the tops, yards, and shrowds, making a striking appearance-of companies of men drawn up in order, in the air.  Then I went on board the Delaware, with the President and several gentlemen of the Marine Committee, soon after which we were saluted with a discharge of thirteen guns, which was followed by thirteen others, from each other armed vessel in the river; then the gallies followed the fire, and after them the guard boats. Then the President and company returned in the barge to the shore, and were saluted with three cheers, from every ship, galley, and boat in the river. The wharves and shores, were lined with a vast concourse of people, all shouting and huzzaing, in a manner which gave great joy to every friend to this country, and the utmost terror and dismay to every lurking tory.  At three we went to dinner, and were very agreeably entertained with excellent company, good cheer, fine music from the band of Hessians taken at Trenton, and continual vollies between every toast, from a company of soldiers drawn up in Second-street before the city tavern, where we dined. The toasts were in honour of our country, and the heroes who have fallen in their pious efforts to defend her. After this, two troops of light-horse, raised in Maryland, accidentally here in their way to camp, were paraded through Second-street, after them a train of artillery, and then about a thousand infantry, now in this city on their march to camp, from North Carolina. All these marched into the common, where they went through their firings and manoeuvres; but I did not follow them. In the evening, I was walking about the streets for a little fresh air and exercise, and was surprised to find the whole city lighting up their candles at the windows. I walked most of the evening, and I think it was the most splendid illumination I ever saw; a few surly houses were dark; but the lights were very universal. Considering the lateness of the design and the suddenness of the execution, I was amazed at the universal joy and alacrity that was discovered, and at the brilliancy and splendour of every part of this joyful exhibition. I had forgot the ringing of bells all day and evening, and the bonfires in the streets, and the fireworks played off.  Had General Howe been here in disguise, or his master, this show would have given them the heart-ache.

  Dr Sir Philadelphia July 5th 1777 Your several favours of 10th & 11th ulto have come to hand,(1) and you may rely on my best attention to all your commands.  Mr Penn is arrived, and has brought the papers necessary for obtaining the money, but the Treasury being very nearly exhausted of all former emissions I fear we must wait some time before we can procure a sum from one lately voted adequate to the demand. We have however obtained an order of Treasury for three hundred thousand dollars to be delivered at Baltimore where the press and Signers are, and the Board of War are properly instructed to forward it without delay.(2)  I observe the Resolve of the Assembly directs the Delegates to send forward 250,000 dollars and the residue of the 500,000 not drawn for under this Resolve, or previous thereto.  Two difficulties occur. Are the 250,000 to be considered as part of the 500,000, or are they to be an additional demand ? Are the Delegates to send this money at the risque of the State, and not in the usual way under the direction of the Board of War? The latter I can not think to have been intended by the Assembly, and therefore I have ventured to advise its being sent at the risque of the Continent in the usual way. In this Mr Penn concurs with me. The former question I can not decide upon, but until it is more clearly expressed must suppose it is intended as part of the 500,000 dollars.  We know not what sums have been drawn for by the Treasurers. Mr Johnston did indeed always advise me of his draughts, but Mr Ash did not, and want of information on this head obliges me to retain two hundred thousand dollars to be applied in payment of all the bills drawn heretofore by the treasurers.  I perceive Mr Penn had a bill from Mr Ash in his own favor for sixty odd thousand dollars, on what account this is, I know not, or under what authority Mr Ash has drawn it. But I shall take no notice of it as a public transaction until I see some Resolution of the Assembly which gave rise to it. Your bill in favor of Mr Ellis has been paid, the others are not yet arrived.  Nothing material has happened since I wrote you last, except the celebration of the fourth of July (the Anniversary of the declaration of Independence). You will see it at large in the enclosed paper, but one thing is remarkable, this day, and the 28th of June, memorable for the defence of Sullivan's Island, were both celebrated here, and at both a Hessian band of music which were taken at Princetown performed very delightfully, the pleasure being not a little heightened by the reflection that they were hired by the British Court for purposes very different from those to which they were applied.(3)  JULY 5, 1777  ""

  Gentlemen Philadelphia July 5th. 1777. I recd. a Letter from the Honorable William Greene Esqr. Speaker of the lower House signed at the Request, and in Behalf of, the General Assembly (the Govr. being absent) of the 22d & 24th of June last, directed to Mr. Ellery and myself.(1) Mr. Ellery having some Time before sat out on his Return Home, I instantly, on the same Day I received your Letter, being the third of this Instant July, moved Congress for the Sum requested, being sixty Thousand Pounds (meaning I presumed lawful Money) or two hundred Thousand Dollars. Congress were much surprised that so large a Sum should be requested so soon after the large Sum granted the State of Rhode-Island &c. The Gentlemen of the Treasury Board would hardly allow it possible You should have expended such very considerable Sums on Continental Account, and moved that the Sum of sixty Thousand Dollars only should be now granted, especially as it was very probable the Continent would soon have Occasion for large Drafts upon the Eastern Loan Offices, if the Enemy's Movements should be into New-England, or up the North River, the latter of which from Genl. Washington's Letters that Day received, seemed, and still appears most probable.  I did not fail to state and urge, in the strongest Manner I was capable of, the Necessity and Expediency of this Supply, the absolute Necessity you would otherwise be under of emitting a large Sum, the destructive Consequences of which we are all awakened to. I further suggested, what I fully imagine to be the Case, that a very great Part  July 5, 1777  Portrait of Henry Marchant  of this Sum would go into the Loan office by Way of Discount with the State, that it could not be expected so large a Sum would in Fact be thrown into that Office. After a considerable Debate, the Consideration thereof was submitted to the Treasury Board. I applied there this Morning and inforced my Application with every additional Argument in my Power, and was very happy in obtaining a Report agreable to my Wishes, and upon which the inclosed Resolves passed Congress.(2) I inclose You also an Order from the President in Consequence of One of said Resolves, on Jos. Clarke Esqr. Comr. of the Loan Office State of Rhode-Island, for One hundred and Ninety Thousand Dollars. As by the Speakers Letter your Delegates were required to accept of the Bills which might be drawn on them by Messrs. Saml. Purviance and Company for a Load of Flower &c, and as you had not directed your Delegates where the Bills were to be paid, and as I could not tell what Sum the Bills might amount to, I obtained the other Resolve inclosed for the remaining ten Thousand Dollars to be advanced your Delegates out of the Treasury here. If the Bills should not be forwarded to me for Acceptance and Payment, I can at your Request procure an Order of Congress for the same to be paid you out of the Loan office in Our State. Whatever Directions herein I may receive, I shall endeavour to comply with, and hope what is done will meet with your approbation. I should be glad that an Account of the Expenditures on the Continental Account comprehending the Account last Spring sent forward, and the Amount of the whole Sums advanced by the State on Continental Account from the first Advances, and the whole Sum at various Times received and placed to Continental Credit might be sent me, for my own Information, that I may be the better able to state to Congress or the Treasury Board the Propriety of your Applications in Future.  Such has been the great Demand for Loan Office Certifficates that the Treasurer has not been able to forward them from Maryland (where he now is) as fast as called for. The Treasury Board are in Daily Expectations of receiving a large Supply, and will immediately send a proper Number to the State of Rhode Island &c I have the Honor to be, Gentlemen, your most obedient, humble Servant,  Henry Marchant ""

You are to proceed in Said Sloop from Senepuxent for the Port of Nantes in France where you must apply to William Lee and Thomas Morris Esquires Commercial Agents of the United States and they will supply you with Money to defray the expences of your Journay from thence to Paris and back. Whilst you are on that journay your Lieutenant must employ the Crew in heaving down, Cleaning and refitting the Sloop, and in getting all such things done to her as may be necessary. The Agents will supply the Money and other articles proper on this Occasion for amount whereof you must grant them receipts. You must give directions also to your Lieutenant and other Officers to engage as many Seamen as possible that you may return full manned-the more the better only taking care to lay in a Stock of Provisions proportioned to the number of men you get. You are to receive from the Honorable Docter Franklin and the other Commissioners at Paris all Letters and dispatches they have to Send, and to wait any time they may think proper to detain you.  You are to receive from the Commercial Agents any goods they have to send out by the Sloop and bring from [them] also all Letters and Packets they have to send. Should the Honorable Commissioners think it necessary to detain you any time for their dispatches, it may probably be an eligible plan for you to make a Cruize on our enemies Trade from which you may return at an appointed Time for their dispatches & then also take in such goods as may be ready. This you may propose to the Commissioners and to the Agents.  If you are fortunate enough to take any Prizes you will send them to Address of said Agents, who will receive the Continental Share and divide the other as it ought.  When you are dispatched from France you must make the best of your way for this Coast and get into the first safe port you can, immediately bringing to us all the dispatches and Letters, which both going & Coming have always ready Slung to a weight sufficient to Sink them, and if you perceive an inevitable misfortune put them into the Sea for they must not on any Account fall into the enemies hands.  You must duely observe the Instructions of the Navy Board, preserve strict discipline but use your Officers & men well that they may be fond of the service-treat Prisoners with humanity and in All things  JULY 5, 1777  act the part becoming an active good Officer which will recommend you to, Sir, your hble servants  ""

  Hond Sir Philadelphia July 5. 1777 The current News all the road as We came, was that the Enemy were pushing to this City & had made considerable Progress, that Ships were up the river as high as Kings Ferry, that the Boats were taken up by Genl Washington &c which determined our rout by the Way of Fish Kill, Easton & Bethlehem, which made our Journey long & tedious, so that we did not arrive here 'till Tuseday the 24th ulto, thro the good Hand of God, in Health & Safety.(1) Our Intelligence from the Armys was vague & uncertain on the road & even here. What has happened since, the partial Battle & the evacuation of the Jerseys, & it is now reported of Staten Island, &c you will have heard by Mr. Sherman & otherwise, I dare Say, eer this can reach you & more perfectly than I can give it. There is great reason to believe the Enemy are bound to the nothern quarter or to New England, & if reports are true They have sailed & their Designs are known before this. Our Letters from Genl. Sinclair who commands at Tya. indicate his full Expectation of being attacked by Genl. Carlton, & I wish I cod say of his readiness to receive Them, but not so, & if They go to New England it will thro my dear Country into great Distress but I shod hope our army will be able to meet them before They can make any great Progress. Our Sins are so great that We have reason to expect severe Correction. O that this People were wise, but there is no appearance of it. God will accomplish his own Designs & what He does is, & will be right & as You piously observe, \""future Events are in the safe hand of the all wise & most merciful Director.\"" The Enemy have left Jersey in Desolation & ruins where They had been & marked their way with merciless rage & Brutality. May the God of Heaven look on & pity the Sufferings of his People & save Us from the further Effects of their Brutal Rage. The Accos you had recd. of the raising & joining of the southern Troops were certainly not just. I will not say how untrue, for obvious reasons.  The Jersey militia turn'd out most spiritedly on the last occasion. To their active zeal & exertions, it may in good measure (under God) be ascribed that the Enemy proceeded no further. I find Congress much as I left it, in every respect, some new Members; their Time mostly JULY 5, 1777  taken up by daily Incidents & occurrances, very little progress made in the Confederation. It had passd the Comte of the whole House before I left, has been a good while before Congress & few important questions yet determined, the capital ones of the weight of each Colony in deciding Questions, & Taxation & many others undetermined. The first respecting the Vote of Each has been entered on, & it is most strenuously contended in behalf of the larger ones that their vote shall be proportionate to their population which is forcably opposed. I trust & hope it will be carried in favor of the equal Footing it has been, & without it, the smaller Colonies will be in effect swallow'd up & annihilated.  Your Letter to the Presidt & its inclosures are recd,(2) the papers not read in the House, but committed. I cant say what will be done. Nothing but what is originated in this Batch of Politicians seems to make any great impression. Mr. Erkelens seems to be vanished, we can find He has been here, but no Body knows who or where he is, tho I believe by enquiry he is in Town, but have not been able yet to find him. I suspect he is chagrined at the cool reception he has met with, & keeps retired.(3)  We have applied for the Arms you wrote by Us for, but find exceeding Difficulty in obtaining Them. I believe not a man southward or in the middle Department is supplied with an Arm but by the Continent. We have done it thro zeal & strong attachmt to the Cause, & yet They will not seem to know, believe or care any thing about it. There is indeed such a thing as being righteous overmuch, & yet I can hardly expect that we have in such Instances fallen into this Error, but shod N. E. be attacked & unarmed we shod have reason. The matter is however referd to Genl Washington,(4) & Mr Sherman is to negotiate the Affair with him on his return (he set out the 2d Inst).(5) More than all the Arms We have are wanted, which must be allowed as some excuse for their lothness to comply.  We have a very extra[ordinar]y Contract now Iying before Congress entered in Sepr. last by Mr. D.__with Monsr Du Coudray (after a long list of pre nomens) who is present, making him Genel & Commander in Chief of the whole Choir of Artillery, with power to fill every vacant office now & in future, & to be subject to no Controul but by the Congress & the Comander in Chief of the whole Army, & with the rank of Maj General & his pay as in a separate Department, to be on pay from the 1st of Augt. last, & a large Train of under officers of various ranks who are with him, for whom also he has made appointments, & to Monsr. & all he had has advanced a half years pay for expences of preparation & Passage, not to be accounted for, & with Pensions for Life equal to half their Pay annually &c &c. The Contract has had several Assignments but is not yet taken up. I do not expect it will be ratified in fu11.(6) I forebear to say many things. The City swarms with French Men.   I dont know but I transgress the Rules We all sign in divulging any Matters sub Judice & unfinished in Congress, but I cant refrain from mentioning important matters to one who has so good a right to know & to whom I & even the Continent are subject to great Obligations but Sr. you will not make them to be publick nor known as from me especially.  The Prices of every thing here are most alarmingly extravagant, much owing to the malicious Cunning of our worst Enemys, the Torys, & coinciding with the boundless avarice of the Merchants, whose Gain is the summum Bonum, & all the God they seem to know, in these parts. Nothing to be done by Congress, because, forsooth, it will be interfering with the internal Police of this grand State, in this respect the mother of Harlots &c. The principle properly applied is however very important. Congress seems to be chaind to this place, & the longer they stay, the stronger a multitude of offices & officers are established & employed in this City, & some of the worst men in some of them.  Yesterday was in my opinion poorly spent in celebrating the anniversary of the Declaration of Independance, but to avoid singularity & Reflection upon my dear Colony, I thot it my Duty to attend the public Entertainment. A great Expenditure of Liquor, Powder &c took up the Day, & of Candles thro the City, good part of the night, I suppose. I conclude much Tory unilluminated Glass will want replacing &c.  Dr. Young died lately of a Fever caught in attending the Congress Hospitals in the City, & was buried the day we came into Town. Poor man He now knows the reality of Things, he lately disputed & disbelieved. Can find out very little of his last Ideas but believe he died just as he lived, expecting if there was a future State that a man of his Benevolence must be happy.  Am extreamly sorry I can not write my hond & worthy Friend, Genl Huntington, & Mr. Hosmer whose Letters I have recd. & shall acknowledge soon as possible. My apology will be I dare say in their opinion sufficient. The Rhumatic Pain that had for long afflicted my right Arm, has a few days since suddenly fallen into my wrist, which is much swolen, has been in great Pain day & night, feels as hot & looks like the Skin of a roasted Pig. It is with much pain I write this, & were it not better than yesterday, it wod have been impossible. They will accept my best Compliments.  I had also a Letter from my most dear Mrs. Williams, it is peculiarly serious I cant write her, please to remember me to her with most tender Affection, & my other dear Friends. May God in infinite Mercy save this People from their Sins & remove his Judgments. I am with all possible esteem, affection & Respect, your most dutiful obedient, Son & Servant, W.

  Dear Sir Philada July 6th 1777 It is with great concern that I inform you we have not been able to send off the money for our State yet. Doctor Burke and myself have done every thing we could to procure it, knowing what pressing demands you have, and the necessity there is for using dispatch; there was very little money in the Treasury when I got here, and one or the other of us has been almost every day at the Treasury Board. I am in hopes we shall be able to dispatch 300,000 dollars in two or three days, you may depend that nothing on our part will be wanting. The money is chiefly raised in this and the Eastern States by way of the Loan Offices.  General Howe after having made a variety of manouvres and finding that Gen Washington would not give up his strong post, went over to Staten Island, and soon after sailed with his troops towards New York. It is supposed that he intends by way of the No River to form a junction with Burgoyne if possible.  General Washington did not incline to risque a battle on equal terms, nor was Gen. Howe willing to attack our army on the hills, or to march far this way. & have our Troops behind him. It is not of my power to tell you how many soldiers are in either army, ours is said to be increasing.

  My dear Sir, Philadelphia July 7.1777 I never before took hold of a Pen to write to my Friend General Green, without Pleasure, but I think myself obliged to do it now upon a Subject that gives me a great deal of Pain.  The Three Letters from the Generals Sullivan, Green and Knox, have interrupted the Deliberations of Congress, and given many of the Members of it much Uneasiness.(1) They thought themselves bound in Honour and Justice to the great Body of People whom they represent, to pass the Resolutions which before this Letter reaches you, will be communicated to you by General Washington.  The Contract between Mr Deane and Monsr Du Coudray, is not yet decided upon. It is in Truth one of the most delicate and perplexing Transactions that has ever fallen in our Way: but those three Letters instead of relieving Us has only increased our Mortification.  Many great Questions ride upon that Contract. Such as these, whether Mr Deane had Authority to make it? If he had not, how far it is consistent with Sound Policy to confirm it. What Merit Monsr Du Coudray has in procuring Cannon, Arms, Ammunition and other Things for our Use. What Interest the French Court may take in our Complyance with the Contract? What Monsr Du Coudrays Abilities to serve Us really are? How far we may comply, consistently with Justice to our own officers? and how far Such a Trust may be confided to a foreign officer with safety to the public interest? &c &c &c. In the Midst of these Deliberations, the Three Letters are received, threatening that if we fullfill the Contract, Three officers, on whom We have depended, will resign in the Midst of the Campaign when the Attention of every officer ought to be wholly taken up in penetrating the Designs of the Enemy and in Efforts to defeat them.  If We dissagree to that Contract what will our Constituents say? What will foreign Nations say? Our Journals upon which the Three Letters must appear, will be read by both. Will not foreign Nations say, that the Ambition and Turbulence of three of our best officers necessitated us to violate our public Faith ? JULY 7, 1777  What Confidence will any Nation have in our Promisses, if they think that our Authority is so feeble, among our own Ranks and even among our own officers, that We cannot perform our Covenants for fear of disobliging them ?  What will our Constituents Say? You have lost the Friendship of foreign Powers, you have broken a Covenant with one of the best officers in Europe, and why? because your own officers would not permit you to perserve your own Honour.  It is impossible now for Congress even to determine that Deane had no authority to make the Bargain, without exposing themselves to the Reflection that their own officers intimidated them into it.  I must be careful my Friend in Saying, that if you or the other Generals Sullivan and Knox, had seriously considered the Nature of a free Constitution, and the Necessity of preserving the Authority of the Civil Powers above the military, you never would have written such Letters.  The Right of an officer to resign I shall not dispute, and he must judge for himself, what Causes will justify him-but surely you ought to have waited, till Monsr Du Coudray had appeard in Camp and assumed the command, before you resigned, or at least untill you had seen an attested Copy of our Journals in which he was appointed to supercede you.  I must needs freely say, that there is more of Rashness, Passion and even Wantonness in this Proceeding than I ever expected to see in my Friend Green and Knox in whose Judgment and Discretion I had the Utmost Confidence. If the Letters had been written to individual Members of Congress, in private Confidence, desiring to be informed what Congress had done, and conveying the Same sentiments, it would have been attended with no evil Consequences, but Letters addressed to Congress, which must be recorded in the Journals and published for the Inspection of all the World, are exposed to the Reflections of all the World, and one Instance of the Kind passing with Impunity establishes a Preceedent for all future officers, and one stride after another will be taken, one Breach of the Priviledge of Congress after another will be made, and one Contempt of its authority after another will be offered, untill the officers of the Army will do as most others have done, wrest all authority out of civil Hands and set up a Tyrant of their own.  I hope these Letters will have no Influence upon Congress in determining Du Coudray's Pretensions, but of this I am sure, they will not induce them to grant him less Rank and Emoluments, than they would otherwise have undertaken.  Nothing in this affair gives me more Pain than the Necessity you have laid Us under of passing a Resolution, which will lessen your Characters and diminish the Confidence which the good People of America have in your Judgment, and attachment to the Principles of   Liberty. But there was not one Member of Congress who dared to justify the Letters, very few who could say a Word in Mitigation or Excuse. It was universally considered as betraying the Liberties of the People to pass them by unanswered. Some were more for dismissing all three of you instantly from the service, others for ordering you to Philadelphia, under arrest to answer for this offence.  The Resolution expresses an Expectation that some Acknowledgment or Apology will be made. I sincerely hope it will, for I think that in a cool Reconsideration of those Letters, the Impropriety and Danger of them must be manifest.  I would be far from dictating to you, or giving Advice unasked, but I really think, that a Declaration that you had no Intention to influence Congress, to contemn its authority or infringe the Liberties of the People or the Priviledges of Congress, a Declaration that you have the fullest Confidence in the Justice of Congress and their Deliberations for the public Good, is the best that you can do, provided you can do this with Truth and sincerity, if not I think you ought to leave the service.

  My dear Sir Philadelphia July 7. 1777 Yours of June 22d recd only to day. We have no Thoughts of leaving JULY 7,1777  Philadelphia. I believe Howe has no Thoughts of attempting it-but if he has We are determined to keep it. Our Army, with the assistance of the Militia, will be sufficient to defend it.  Why our Army fills up no faster I cant conceive. The Massachusetts Regiments at Ti are not one Third full. And We cannot learn from Peeks Kill, that Putnam ever had above six Thousand Men, in all, from Mass., Rhode Island, Connecticutt and New York. You must have been deceived in the Numbers inlisted.  There is a loud Complaint here, about Arms. Eighteen Thousand Arms have arrived at Portsmouth and We know not what becomes of them. Other Arms have arrived in Mass. but We know not where they are, and it is Said the Game Cock carried Six Thousand into Dartmouth. Where are they?  I wish you Joy of your Employment in making a Constitution. Hope you will make a good one. I hope to Sit quietly under it, altho I shall have no hand in forming it.(1) Do you intend to make every Man of 21 a Voter for the Council? I have nothing to Say, but I fear you will find a Fountain of Corruption, in making so many Voters.  The Bill for freeing the Negroes, I hope will sleep for a Time. We have Causes enough of Jealousy, Discord & Division, and this Bill will certainly add to the Number. (2)  I am weary enough of Complaints, concerning Navy Matters. I do all I can in public and private to Stimulate but all in vain. The Commissions were never sent untill 4 or 5 days ago by Mr Sherman. The Instructions are not Sent yet. Who is in Fault, I dont say. (3) It is enough for me to answer for my own Faults.  Is a certain elevated Citizen (4) to put his Hand upon the Pommell of one Chair, and leap into another, at 370 Miles Distance?  For my own Part I wish to see Gravity, Wisdom, Constancy and Fortitude in every Chair upon the Continent. My Hopes were placed upon Mr B.(5) but his Retirement, has damped if not extinguished them. My next Expectations were from the Philosopher (6)___But I doubt whether the popular Breath will blow that Way. My Wishes and Judgment are entirely for another.(7) But I know not the Chance.  I Should be more anxious about the Chair, if I were to be near it. But I pant and sigh for private Life and rural Felicity. Here all my Wishes terminate--and the sooner I reach it, with an eternal Renunciation of all concerns with the public, the better for me. An Idol in the Chair that I cannot and will not worship, will only facilitate my Progress to that Condition in human Life, where alone I can be happy or even comfortable.  ""

  Dear Sir Philadelphia July the 7th 1777 I wrote you a few days agoe by Coll. Stewart which hope you have Recievd. We have in the Course of a few days recieved some Very Unpolite letters from two or three Gentn of high rank & Esteem in the Army Viz Genlls Green, Sullivan & Knox. If they had prudently wrote the same Matter to any particular friend Member of Congress & he had divulged it to his brethren no offence would have been taken & it might have Answered every valuable purpose, but to write to Congress as a Body while they had a matter under consideration (I mean the affair of the Command of Monsr. de Coudre) to dictate to or Influence their Conduct is looked upon by many as the highest Insult and Indignity & which they cannot pass by without the severest Censure, or Otherwise must give up their own dignity & superiority to a few Gentn of the Army, & who will Assume for the future to dictate & Influence all their measures, or if Congress do not at once Yield they will resign their Commissions, break up the Army & leave their Country to the total desolation & Subjection of the Enemy. This is the Construction many  JULY 7, 1777  put on their Conduct. There is a Number of us endeavour to palliate matters to soften the Asperity of others, tho all Condemn the manner of those Gentns letters & the timeing of them. Indeed they will have a bad effect on the Matter Under Consideration. I believe there would have been great caution & prudence in that affair. We readily felt for those Gentn & the Indignity it might at least be Construed to be to place Monsr. de Coudre in a rank superior to them. It would have been opposed, & believe never would have taken place, but these Gentn before the matter was so much as debated in Congress have thrown in their threats to them as a body that if they do this &c they will immediately leave the Army. It embarrasses every free Step both in debate and Conclusion, for if they now refuse which I dare say they before would have done to give de Coudre a Superior Command instead of being Imputed to their Justice & prudence, it will be entirely attributed to their fear occasioned by the threats of those Gentn and the Consequence will be, in every matter for the future. We must be either Dictated to or threatned by the Army or if we do not do this, or that, or just what they please, they will give up the cause or goe over to the Enemie, Sacrifice their Country, &c.  They will easily see the Impropriety, & I believe they were in no danger before. Am extremely sorry it has happened, how severe the conclusions will be I know not, Some threaten hard, others Indeavour to moderate; the times are truly Critical & I think those Gentn. would not wish to lessen the Authority, Esteem or dignity of Congress, as their own & Countrys honor, Safety & Liberty so much at present depends upon its being preserved & whatever may be the result I hope they will take it patiently consider themselves as Imprudently (at least) giving an Occasion. A few reflections will be for their honour and all may be set right. They must Consider their Country at Stake which I hope they preferr above everything else even their own particular honor, or life, I mean in the manner in which it may be effected in Compromising this matter which I hope would establish, instead of wounding it in the least. As they threaten to resign, it is a wonder if Congress dont tell them they may just when they please but I hope these Gentn love their Country too well. This is a most unhappy affair & our old Friend D-an has been in more Instances than one, Imprudent to the last degree, he has brot us into the most unhappy Dilemma in several of his Contracts & Stipulations with Gentn sending over Sworms of Commanders, Pensioners &c &c. I dare say no more at present upon the Subject & trust you will Improve what is said with caution and prudence, if these Gentn. knew how Congress were embarrassed & plagued with D__ n's Imprudence & his__ they would rather pity than Insult. I did not think it best to write to either of the Gentn. directly, but to you that you might deal out to them or either, any part you think proper that they may be prepared. Numbers in C___ ss will Meliorate and Soften  down as far as possible & hope those Gentn. will not be averse to some reasonable Concessions or at least if they are told as they threaten they may give up their Commissions as soon as they please. The Congress is ready to receive them Yet they will persist to serve their Country, & preferr Jerusalem above their Chief Joy. I write this with the Utmost Friendly disposition & design towards them. Hope all will be properly settled but the General Cause must not Suffer. Make the best of this letter for a few days, then burn it. Hope you will see the Gentn as soon as possible if in your Neighbourhood or some of them & let them know the  friendly hints you have had from a Member of Congress &c. Can say no more. Am Sincerely Yours, Elipht Dyer  [P.S.] Hope to hear from you as often as leisure will permit a few lines or more as the Subject offers or time will afford. I hear Root is returned home. Wish he might Succeed to some good place in the Army. E.D.(1)  Please to accept the kind Compliments of your cordial Friend & Bror. W Williams  ""

Inclosg. a coppy of a letter from our Cols at Ticonda. and laid it before Congress who gave orders for a Supploy of Cloathing to be forwarded with all dispatch to Ticonderoga for the trups there;(1) I should have backed the aforesaid letter by laying Yours also before congress but could not without dishonour to my selfe not to say with som Reflection on My Worthy frind Col. Bartlet (as the manner of his addres was to Col. Whipple and in his absence to Geo. Frost thereby treeting me as a spare topmast). Sr. I trust it was not out of any disregard.  You say the State is about to make application to Congress for Money to redeam our paper bills. I wish I could give you any incoragement of Succes; the Treasure here is so low that it takes all the money for the army. I wrote you in my last (2) Col. Whipple Recd. an Order on the loan office for 100,000 Dollars. If you are in Cash at Sd. office perhaps you may git a further Order on it. I am sorrey for the distress you seem to be in on Account of our moneys being counterfited. I hope the State wont be wanting in Duty to themselves in not haveing a proper Spirit to Inflict a proper punishment on those (without Distinction) who are the authers of so heanious a crime of countifiting our Money. I shall give you som parragraphs of a letter from a gentleman of distin- JULY 7, 1777  tin in Spain (you'l see it was not Intended it should be made public) dated March 18th 1777.(3) \""As for an Immediate declaration in your favour they say this is not the moment & for Reasons which if I might venture to Commit them on this paper I think you woud deem satisfactory. The same Reason render an explicet acknoligement of Your Independency & a treaty of Alliance With you inadmissible at present but am desired to assure you of their taking a sincere & Zealous part in the Establishment of Your liberties which they will promote in every way consistent with their own Situation. I cannot help thinking that the postponing a treaty is happy for us since our present situation woud raise demands and perhaps enforce Concessions of which we might sorely Repent hereafter. I am sensible that in Consequence we shall be Obliged to make greater exertions & to serch deeper for resources within our selves but this must in the end be highly benifical to a Young People. It was in this manner the Roman Republic was so deeply rooted and then the liberty which are hardly earned will be highly prized & long preserved. I mentioned in my last that the Germans intended to be sent the latter end of this month thro Holland were to consist of Seven thousand recruits but from the Best Accounts I can git they will neither be so forward nor so numerous as was Intended. To retard them the more I have proposed to the Commissioners at Paris to Remostrate with the States General against granting them a passage which is to expediate their embarkation & I have written to Holland to have the Account of the Captivity of their Countrymen and the refusel to Exchange them, settle a Cartel distributed among the troops in German before they Embark. If they are not very beasts indeed this will rouse a spirit of Indignation against their Buyers & Sellers.\"" You'l please to give my Best Respects to the Honoble.

  Dear Sir, 7th July 1777 As you seemed particularly to wish when you left Philadelphia to be made acquainted with the proceedings in the Commercial and Foreign JULY 7, 1777  Committees, I would inform you that last Saturday Mr Geary, Mr. W. Smith & Mr Heywood were joined to Messrs. Morris and Livingston, to the no small mortification of H___ n (1) Geary pleaded hard to be excused but we would not allow of it till a proper opportunity. This day we have the pleasure of knowing we shall soon have that opportunity to the double mortification of said H___ ; for we this day find that Col R H Lee has not only rec'd the most honorable testimonies of approbation for his past conduct but was elected anew on the 24th ulto. Old H___ has whispered it all along on the road that Col Lee has ordered his overseer to demand produce or bullion for rent, but this was proved to be false by the fullest declaration of the overseer and other evidence.(2) I feel exceedingly glad on this event, and should be completely secure against the prevalence of a certain set, if a certain late resolute member of the Marine Committee was about to return speedily from Portsmouth,(3) one, who though quite as honest as his neighbors, yet did not confess ten times a day \""I dont know what the question is Mr President\"" like good honest I, for be sure I mean myself.  We of the other Committee have sent an armed sloop to France.(4) The Commissioners [i.e. Commissions of] Wm. Lee and Izzard do not promise ratification of whatever they may transact, but their proceedings on commercial treaties at Vienna, Berlin and Tuscany are to receive our approbation and only to continue 12 years, though a treaty of friendship may be made outright for a longer period.(5)  I will aim to send you the issue of a plaguy altercation upon bringing on afresh the affair of the New Hampshire Grants. I was unfortunately confined to my bed and G divided against S.A. on the two last resolves as did Elmore against Serjeant, the others of the two States being absent. You must know that Jimmy D. has got E__ re fast.(6) I do not however think that New York has much to boast of. It is still a mootpoint whether the people of the Grants belong to Massachusetts, New Hampshire or New York.  I forgot to mention that we have a good opportunity to send duplicates of all our papers by Mr McCreary who is going to settle at Nantz for some time. Du Coudray's treaty is not yet determined upon; but I think there will be few advocates for confirming it. The 4 Engineers who were the only persons absolutely sent for, are arrived; and though modest men, upon a very modest treaty, yet possitively refuse to be under the command of Du C___ y who has duped Deane to make him Commander in Chief of all the artillery and engineering through the States. But this is only a part of our present distraction. For 1st Sullivan sends to know whether the report is true that Congress has ratified De C___y's claim, because if it is, he desires leave to resign. Two days after Green and Knox proceed in the same style. This is judged to be a military attempt to influence our free deliberations. For it is certain, they know we had  JULY 8, 1777  not settled the matter or General Washington would have rec'd the Resolves. If they chose to take it for a thing done why did they not ask leave to retire without any ifs. There is as much pulling and hauling, about rank and pay, as if we had been accustomed to a military establishment here 150 years.  That same Mr Nicholas Davis who got the money of our Commissioners and then drew a Bill of Exchange upon them in France, and afterwards imposed upon Bingham, is now here. He turned an evidence against the Seine to condemn her; and yet has had the impudence to come hither. He is a meagre, smooth tongued, sly chap and I believe will go unpunished for he has nothing but dress; and to make him rot in jail will not regain the money.  I have much to scrawl in the morning both public and private, and it is now past one o'clock as a noisy chap tells me from the street. But I will not take his hint till I have presented my affectionate compliments to your Lady, your brothers and sisters, and any others who love you and do not hate me; further you need not go, for you know I never pretended to the sublime pitch of loving my enemies.  Tell thy African I miss him and his many willing services. I reckon his full joy at getting away from Philadelphia may have intoxicated his former philosophic resolutions, so far as to make him risk becoming the author of a Slave in the early hours of his return to Portsmouth.  Messrs Dyer, Williams and Law have been here 10 days, so that father Sherman is by this time, like your Honor, vigorously serving his country in connection with his nearest dearest friend.

It is nonsense to dance backwards and forwards. After this Year I shall take my Leave.  Our Affairs are in a fine prosperous Train, and if they continue so, I can leave this Station with Honour.

  Sir War Office July 8th 1777 The Generals & Officers in the Northern Department complain JULY 8, 1777  heavily of a great Want of Arms & Cloathing for the Troops under their Command. The Field Officers of the New Hampshire Regiments have represented the Matter in the strongest Terms, & yet the greatest Quantities of both Arms & Clothes have arrived in their State. Mr Langdon, the Agent for the States at Portsmouth, gives himself credit for the Delivery of 2,100 Stands of Arms to the New Hampshire Forces, 4,000 Stands to those of Massachusetts & 3,000 to the Troops of Connecticut. The Return of the N. Hampshire Troops at Tyconderoga amounts to 1063 & I am satisfied they cannot have in their 4 Regiments more Men than they have received Arms. These Matters are inexplicable, but all Accounts agree that whatever might have been their Supplies they are now in Want The Board have directed a thousand Suits of Clothes to be sent as soon as the Clothier General can possibly get them ready, & have directed me to request your Excellency will take Measures for sending forward a Supply of as many Arms as you think can be spared; but how the Number wanted will be ascertained is not known here, for altho' a general Complaint has been made by the Officers they have not been attentive enough to reduce to any kind of Certainty, what Arms, Clothes or Necessaries will answer their Exigencies. The Board never receive Returns but of the Numbers of the Troops. In the British Returns Clothes, Arms & Necessaries (for which they have 3 Columns \""Good,\"" \""bad,\"" \""wanting\"") are always included. Many of our Soldiers have been detected in selling their Necessaries; & Practices of this Sort it is apprehended are but too common amongst them. In the British Service the Serjeants & Corporals are made responsible for the Mens Necessaries of which they return a weekly Account & if any wanting & not lost in actual Service the Men are punished. It is submitted to your Excellency whether Regulations of this kind would not be proper to be introduced into our Army. But unfortunately our Serjeants & Corporals are as raw & want as much Regulation as the privates, whereas in the Enemy's Army much Dependance is placed on their Non Comd. Officers who are in general more acquainted with & attentive to Service than their Superiors.  I have the Honour of your Excellency's Letter of the 7th inst (1) & am surprized at the Delay of mine of the l9th. The Commissary at Springfield has made a Return deficient in every Article according to the Expectations of the Board; but perhaps the Residue was on the Road from Boston when Mr Cheevers made his Return. There certainly ought to be at least nine thousand Stands of Arms at Springfield altho' Mr Cheevers returns only 3320. The Spears are in Hand & I shall urge their speedy Completion. The Cannisters have been sent on some time & I am surprized General Knox has not received them. I endeavoured to have them filled with Cartridges but had not Interest enough with the Officer employed in the Business to have it done.  The enclosed Letter from Monsr.

  July 8t 1777 This Journal (for it is too much for a Letter) I have kept by me several days waiting the departure of Capt Chadd, who has been strangely delayed. General Howe's motions are narrowly watched by General Washington. The first lies with his main army along the north side of Staten Island, & the new Levies sketchd along from the Blazing Star on the South side. General Washington occupies his first Encampment at Morris Town; one Division under Sullivan having marched towards Peeks Kill. If Howe proceeds up the North River he will instantly be followd by the American Army who are in fine order & high Spirits.  I have mentiond in what preceeds the Propriety of instantly communicating the Acts of Congress respecting our Revolters-perhaps the situation of our Affairs to the Northward may make it prudent to delay it for a while. Remember however that Mr Sherman has taken with him to New England a Copy of the Resolutions and no doubt will make them publick.  Adieu and believe me most sincerely, Your Friend,  Jas.

Youll find by Mr Stewart that the Wages of the Dept. & sub Commissys are somewhat raised, your Clerk from 40 to 50 dolls. per month, tho am persuaded it is insufficient Considering his residence must be in Philadelphia but dare say it will soon be raised as believe the other will if on Tryal it is found Insufficient.(2) It is a general Observation in Congress that there is room to rise but no way to fall. I hope Mr Stewards Arrival may give you some relief. Coll Champion & Dunham must not resign. They must Consider the large Profits they have made in years past & goe on in expectation that there wages will be raised when it appears reasonable You have the power to make an Additional allowance for expences as you find occasion not exceeding one dollr & one third per diem. They will consider there Wages of 4 dolls per day goe on every day & there are many days when they are not in Actual service & yet their 4 dolls per day goes on & that their expences are not so high in New England as this way & that all Cost of & expence of drovers & JULY 8, 1777  persons employed to collect & drive the Cattle &c is allowd beside. These New regulations were all come into before my Arrival. I have since procured some Addition to the Wages but it will take some time before the Subject can be taken up again without being Troublesome & a thousand Other matters Crouding. It is impossible for me to Judge for you in this matter as I cannot be fully acquainted with the Troubles & difficulties you have to encountre. Your letter to Congress seems to carry with it an acceptance but suppose if you should find on Tryal that the embarrassments are too great to Struggle with, you may on giving seasonable Notice no doubt resign. It has been several times mentioned in Congress that there is a large quantity of flower up at Lancaster & that was purchased by Walton & in danger of spoiling. I just mention it that you may take that care which belongs to you.  I am much concerned for my son Thos, fear he will not be Able to join the Army & Indeed whether he will survive this sickness. He is very Careless Inattentive to his health and pays but little regard to the Advice of his Physitions. If you should hear further from him should be glad you would Inform me.  Am with sincere regards, E Dyer  [P.S.] The Congress will Insist on some retractions from those Genll officers Who have wrote the letters I mentioned in my last. I hope they may be Induced to make them in some proper manner & soon; as they esteem their honour so much concerned as I fear, the consequences will be serious if not done.  ""

  Dear Sir Philadelphia 8th July 1777 I recd your Favour of yesterday, & am glad to hear that Mr Stewart & Mr Hoop are at the Camp.(1) Mr Buchannan is altogether under your Direction.(2) True it is, the Commissary General of purchases can only appoint a Clerk, but it is also true, that he is exempted from Blame on account of the Misconduct of Officers not of his appointment. If the Salary is not Sufficient for your Clerk, who certainly ought to be a reputable person, Congress will undoubtedly make the necessary Addition. Your Memorandam shall be revived as soon as I can attend the Treasury Board, which will probably be to Morrow. With respect to the Salt which I have in the Massachusetts, if a Vessel can be obtained, it will be sent to the Southward, but I wanted to know whether it can  JULY 8, 1777  be well spared to New York, if it cannot be sent to N Carolina. If you think it necessary to take it for the Continent, I Will Charge You therewith, & shall be glad to have the Vessel discharged without Delay.

  Honourable Gentlemen, Philadelphia, 8th July, 1777. Since our last letter of the 4th instant,(1) the President, at our request, has written to Commissary Trumbull, on the subject of the exchange of the salt appropriated to our State, and we hope this formality will give weight to our own solicitations.  We transmit you the secret committee's order in our favour, on Mr. Mumford, their agent for the salt at Plymouth, and our transfer to you. A copy of our letter to Commissary Trumbull,(2) we also enclose, from which last you will be pleased to observe, that for the sake of despatch, we have requested him to correspond on the subject immediately with yourselves.  Salt continues to be very scarce here and to the southward, the coast being closely watched by the enemy's ships. Mr. Lewis writes from Baltimore the 23rd of June, that two small vessels had arrived there with that article from Virginia, purchased by a private trader, who asked for it no less than 25 a bushel. As we cannot at present expect to get it delivered at this place for a less price, we must request your directions, whether we shall proceed to purchase, and what quantity?  With these despatches we forward a calendar, returned to us by the jailer, of the prisoners sent from our State to Philadelphia, and the time and manner of their discharge.(3) Sutton, whose name you will not observe, never was committed to prison, but left at large, and finally released on his parol at General Morris's intercession, who, it seems, entertained an opinion of him much too favourable.  Finding that our constitution was published on very mean paper, without any marginal notes of the contents, we thought it would not be disagreeable to our State to have an impression struck off here, and we took the same opportunity to have printed the resolutions of Congress respecting the independent government attempted to be established within our jurisdiction; we now forward them to be disposed of as you shall direct.(4) JULY 8, 1777  If our State is likely to be pressed both from the north and the south, which, however rash and desperate, is an enterprise which the enemy once seriously contemplated, and now seems at least as practicable as the conquest of Pennsylvania, you will have but little time to apply to domestic concerns, however urgent; and this may possibly induce you to wish that the publication of the decision of Congress respecting our revolted subjects, may for some time be deferred. From these considerations, we shall refrain from communicating a single copy; but it must be remembered that Mr. Roger Sherman, who is gone to the eastward, was furnished with one, and there is too much room to apprehend that he may forward it to his friends in New-Connecticut.  We have taken the liberty to retain your letter to Congress, of the 17th of June, and the several enclosures. Already have we employed so much of their time on the affairs of our State, that good policy strongly urges us to give them some respite; and as the subject matter of those despatches though of some moment to our State, requires no immediate decision, we flatter ourselves that you will not be displeased with our reserve. The reasons you assign to show that the defence of Hudson's river ought to be a Continental charge, appears to us to be very cogent; and they must always have great weight; and we therefore make no scruple in recommending that all the expenses be charged to the account of the Continent, comprehending even such as may accrue subsequent to the late resolutions of Congress pointing out a discrimination; for, had the transaction been fully explained, we cannot think those resolutions would have passed.(5)  We have the honour to be, with great respect, Honl. gentlemen, Your most obedient humble servants, Phil. Livingston, Jas. Duane, Wm. Duer.  Reprinted from Journals of N.Y. Prov.

  My dear Friend, Philadelphia July 9th. 1777 That I may not give you Reason to think that your Pardon is bestowed on an Ingrate, I steal a Few Moments from urgent Business to acknowledge the Receipt of yours of the Inst.  I have the Pleasure to inform you that Congress have adopted Sundry Resolutions respecting the Insurgents in the Counties of Gloucester, Cumberland, and Charlotte, which, if our New Legislature acts with Spirit, and Wisdom, will I think be attended with happy Effects. We transmit them by this Opportunity to the Council of Safety.  I beleive no Matter has ever been more solemnly argued in Congress than this. The House were in Committee for three Days, and very Warm Opposition was given by some of our Eastern Freinds against the Resolution for dismissing the Petition of Jonas Fay &ca and that censuring Dr. Youngs Incendiary Production. Mr. Sherman was quite thrown off his Bias, and betrayd a Warmth not usually learnt within the Walls of Yale Colledge. I think it is of the utmost Consequence that these Resolu[tio]ns should be generally throughout the revolted Counties, and that means should be speedily devised by the Legislature of doing Right to such as have really Cause of Complaint from the Iniquities of the old Government. Their Number I think is not many.(1)  I am sorry to inform you that Colo. R. H. Lee is returning to Congress Crownd with Laurels.(2) His Smooth Discourse, and Art of Cabal have blunted the Edge of his Countrymens Resentment, and they have lauded him Encomiums on his Patriotism and Attention to Business, which he modestly says, he is Anxious of deserving. For particulars I refer you to the Pensilvania Papers. I suppose he will return here more JULY 9, 1777  rivitted than ever to his Eastern Friends; I assure you they lost in him no Contemptable Ally.  You tell that you hope I have given over Thoughts of returning for some Time. I assure you that I can not with Justice to myself, or indeed with others in our State with whom I have Transactions in Business, stay here long. Since my Letter to you I have made a formal Application to the Council of Safety for Leave of Absence, which I hope will be granted.(3) I entreat your Influence to prevent any Procrastination in this Matter.  At present there are no very great Matters in which our State is particularly interested before Congress; and indeed if they were, Mr. Morris (4) can supply my Place with great Advantage to the Reputation of the State, as well as his own. His Coolness of Temper, and happy Vein of Irony are Qualifications, which would render him a very powerful Antagonist to Mr. R. H. Lee.  I hope you will give him a Hint not to neglect this great Orator. You may depend upon it, he will advance his own Reputation, and be of Advantage to the Public in making the Person appear in that Contemptable Point of View which he really deserves.  In Case I have not Time to write to Mr. Jay, I beg you to remember me to him and to Mr Morris. I am very affectionately, Yours,  W. Duer.  ""

  Philad. 10th July 1777 Since our Letter of Yesterday the Connecticut Courant of the 30th of June last has made it's appearance in this City. It contains a new and extraordinary Declaration from a part of our State which is attempted to be wrested out of our Jurisdiction and which is dubbed The State of Vermont: a name hatched for it in Philadelphia. Indeed it is evident that the plan has been laid here under the direction of Doctor Young (and too probably of some others of more Consequence) and that his Letters have pushed the People to this last Extremity. The more effectually to impose upon the publick they have subjoind a List of their Complaints against the late Government of New York, and have not even spared the late Convention. Such a Train of Falsehoods and misrepresentations does but little Credit to this meek Convention which will very probably proceed to elect Delegates for Congress, and once more press for their admission. Be this as it may confident we are that they will meet with the utmost discouragement.(1)  One of the Printers who has been requested to publish this production called upon us with it, and proposd, himself, that it shoud be preceeded or followed by the Resolutions of Congress of the 30t of June. It is probable we shall consent to it to prevent any bad Impression which it might otherwise occasion; and for the same Reason we have thoughts of making some Observations on the ostensible Causes which are assignd in Support of the Project of a seperate Government; that the matter may appear in it's true Light.(2)  JULY 10, 1777  We have the Honour to be, with great Respect, your most Obedient huml Servants, Jas.

  Dear Sir Philadelphia July 12th. 1777 In My last I wrote you some parragrafts of a letter from Spain. The post went so sudden I had not time to finish 'm and would now continu. them.(1) \""We are Assured by Both France and Spain that such a Disposition of their fleets & forces will be made as ought to perswade England that she cannot Sustain the war against you as she has planned. Your Wisdom will direct you how fer to trust to those assurances or their expected consequences when our stake is so presious that the most ardent & Unremitting exertions cannot be too great, not that I suspect the Sincerity of those Assurances but the effects they are to produce. From Germaney they have little more to hope to Raise Recrutes. To Russia alone they may apply if the Cloud that is rising from Constantinople should blow over without which it is Impossible they should have any aid from thence, but if this should happen it will be our endeavour & I hope we shall succead in rasing the Opposition of Other European powers to that measure. I mean to propose on my Return to Paris the Sounding both the Emperour & the King of Prussia (to which Courts we (the Congress) have sent Commissioners to anounce our Independency and Settle a treaty of frindship and Commerce) on this Subject. The one wishes to promote the port of Ostend the other of Emden & by those we may perhaps work them up to our wishes. It is upon this View of things that I found my hopes of the next Campaign being the last Struggle of any Importance the Enemy can make against us. The Dutch on whom Britian so much depend withold their money as fer as they can find Spanish paper to vest it in. The degree of their alarm from France & Spain may be seen from the Embodying of the Militia & their Expences. I belive their divisions at home are apparent from the suspension of the Habus Corpus Act which will proberly [realize?] their apprehensions of Domistic troubles. The measure of their iniquity is now full when they have put the liberty of every Subject in the power of the most merciless & Unprincipled Tyrent that ever disgraced a throne.\"" The State of Europe is such as to Render it morally certain that a war in Europe will relive you from extraordinary exertions befor a year has passed away.

But it will prove no Benefit to them. I begin to Wish there was not a Fort upon the Continent Discipline and Disposition, are our Resources.  It is our Policy to draw the Enemy into the Country, where We can avail ourselves of Hills, Woods, Walls, Rivers, Defiles &c. untill our Soldiers are more inured to War.  How and Burgoine will not be able to meet, this Year, and if they were met, it would only be better for Us, for We should draw all our Forces to a Point too.  If they were met, they could not cutt off the Communication, between the Northern and Southern States. But if the Communication JULY 13, 1777  was cutt off for a Time, it would be no Misfortune, for New England would defend itself, and the Southern States would defend themselves.  Coll.

I confess it is not more than I expected when Genl Schu[yle]r was again intrusted with the Command there.

  My dear Freind Philade July 15 1777 I wrote to you a Fortnight ago in so great Haste that I had not time to transcribe or correct it, and relied on your Candor to overlook the slovenly dress in which it was sent to you. You have since heard that JULY 15, 1777  our Friends in Jersey have at length got rid of as vindictive and cruel an Enemy as ever invaded any Country. It was the opinion of General Gates that Howes advancing to Somerset Court House was a Feint to cover the Retreat of his Battering Train, ordinance, Stores and heavy Baggage to Amboy. I confes I cannot help yet feeling myself chagrind, that no more has been done to diminish his paltry Army in that State. If their Militia, among whom so great an Animation prevaild, had been let loose upon the Enemy, who knows but that they wod. have destroyd their Army, or at least so far have weakend it as to have put a glorious End to this Campaign, and perhaps the War! I will acknowledge that my Temper is rather sanguine. I am apt to be displeasd when I think our Progress in War and in Politics is Slow. I wish to see more of an enterprizing Spirit in the Senate and the Feild, without which I fear our Country will not speedily enjoy the Fruits of the present Conflict-an established Independence and Peace. I cannot applaud the Prudence of the Step, when the People of Jersey were collected, and inspired with Confidence in themselves & each other, to dismiss them as not being immediately wanted, that they might go home in good Humour and be willing to turn out again in any other Emergency. I profess not the least Degree of Knowledge in military Matters, & therefore hazzard no opinion. I recollect however that Shakespeare tells us, there is a Tide in human Affairs, an Opportunity which wise Men carefully watch for and improve, and I will never forget because it exactly coincides with my religious opinion and I think it warranted by holy Writ, that \""God helps those who help themselves.\""  We have letters from General Schuyler, in the Northern Department, giving us an Account of untoward Situation of our Affairs in that Quarter. I confess it is no more than I expected, when he was again intrusted with the Command there. You remember it was urged by some That as he had a large Interest and powerful Connections in that Part of the Country, no one could so readily avail himself of Supplys for an Army there than he. A most Substantial Reason, I think, why he should have been appointed a Quartermaster or a Commissary. But it seems to have been the prevailing Motive to appoint him to the Cheif Command! You have his Account in the inclosed News paper, which leaves us to guess what is become of the Garrison. It is indeed droll enough to see a General not knowing where to find the main Body of his Arrny.

There is so many fond of their New plan that it is difficult to make them attend to the Objections against and cannot bare so soon to throw up What they have entertained so great a fondness of but however they soon agreed to send a Comtee of Congress to goe to the Army and see and hear and report.(1) The Congress is very thin and most Gentn. had a Very great Aversion to goe on this business. Except Mr Gerry I think there could scarce been one more unsuitable. Mr Livingston was chose one principally because he was gone that way before and would be in the way. I much fear the Consequence arising from this New Regulation but hope for the best. Every thing must be Endured before the Army must fail. It is said in Congress by some that you must goe on your Old way till the New one gets into a proper regulation and employe purchasers as formerly. I know not what or how to advise you only in General to do the Utmost in your power to advance and promote the general good and service.(2) Am sure I should at once advise you to quit if I did not apprehend the worst Consequences would follow and if you do not it may possibly be as bad unless Congress should place the purchasing Commissy. business in the same line as formerly. If the Comtee should report favorably that way it may possibly be done. If you had the appointment of your Depty Commiss of purchasers and to allow Wages according to their Merrit I see no difficulty in carrying on your part but fear it will be hard to bring them back to that mode unless the Genll. and Comtee should recommend it.  The News we have recievd from Ticonderoga is truly Alarming. Fear it will throw the New England States into the greatest Consternation. Expect the Enemies ships are all along the sea coast giving the alarm there to divert them from giving aid to other parts where they may be wanted. Expect every hour to hear Genll. How has pushd up the North river. God grant he may meet with a repulse there. I fear the late success of the Enemy will again oblidge us to call of Our Militia as last summer and now in this most Critical season. There ar about 15 hundrd. or two thousand Southern Troops now forwarding from this place to join Genll. Washington.

I have inclosed you the Newspapers and written you a Line, every Week, for several Months past.

As to the Tories, I think our General Court would do well to imitate the Policy of Pensilvania, who have enjoyned an Oath to be taken by all the People, which has had an amazing Effect.

The Design of the Enemy, is now no doubt to attack poor New England on all sides, from Rhode Island, New York and Ticonderoga.

People here are open mouthed, about the Disgrace and Disaster in that Quarter, and are much disposed to Censure. For my Part I suspend my Judgment, until I know the Facts. I hope the People with you will not be too much dejected at the Loss. Burgoine is a wild Man, and will rush into some inconsiderate Measures, which will put him in our Power, but if not, his Career will be stopped.  The Loss of so many Stores is more provoking than that of the Post.  Before this reaches you, I hope you will be happy in the Embraces of a little female Beauty. God bless her. Pray let me continue to hear from you, every Week. When you cant write, make some other Pen do the Duty.  We have had here a few hot days, when Fahrenheits Mercury was at 88, but the Weather has in general been very cool. Such a July was scarcely ever known, which is a fortunate Circumstance for the Health of our Army.  We have The four Months of August, September, October and November, before Us, for the Armies to Act in. There is Time enough to do a great deal of Business. I hope, that the Enemy will not do so much Mischief as last Year, altho their Exploits then have not done them much Good, nor the united States as a Community, much harm.  The Examples of Meigs, and Barton, will be followed I hope, by Numbers. The Sub[t]lety, the Ingenuity, the Activity, the Bravery, the Prudence, with which those Excursions were conducted, are greatly and justly admired.  Connecticutt has the Honour of one, Rhode Island of the other. Will Mass. be outdone ?  JULY 20, 1777  ""

  My best Friend Philadelphia JULY 21. 1777 I have long sought for a compleat History of the Revolution in the low Countries, when the Seven united Provinces seperated from the Kingdom of Spain, but without the Success that I wished, untill a few days ago.  Sir William Temples Account is elegant and entertaining, but very brief and general.(1)  Puffendorfs, I have not yet seen. Grotius's I have seen, and read in Part, but it is in Latin, and I had it not in my Possession long enough, to make myself master of the whole.  A few days ago, I heard for the first Time, of an History of the Wars in Flanders, written in Italian by Cardinal Bentivoglio, and translated into English by the Earl of Monmouth. The Cardinal was a Spaniard and a Tory, and his History has about as much Candor towards the Flemish and their Leaders as Clarendon has towards Pym and Hampden, and Cromwell. The Book is in Folio, and is embellished with a Map of the Country and with the Portraits of about Thirty of the Principal Characters.  Mr. Ingersol, who lent me the Book, told me, that in the Year 1765 or 6, being in England, he was invited together with Dr. Franklin to spend a Week in the Country with a Mr. Steel a Gentleman of Fortune, at present an eloquent Speaker in the Society of Arts, descended from Sir Richard Steel.(2) Upon that Visit Mr. Steel told them that the  JULY 21, 1777  Quarrell which was now begun by the Stamp Act would never be reconciled, but would terminate in a Separation between the two Countries. Ingersol was surprized at the Praediction and asked why and how? I cant tell you how says he, but if you want to know why, when you return to London, enquire at the Booksellers for Bentivoglios History of the Wars in Flanders, read it through, and you will be convinced that such Quarrells cannot be made up.  He bought the Book accordingly and has now lent it to me. It is very similar to the American Quarrell in the Rise and Progress, and will be so in the Conclusion.  ""

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia July 21st 1777 I shall only acknowledge the receipt of your pleasing favor of the 8th and enclose you a newspaper. I am not at leisure, and scarcely in a temper, to make reflexions upon the vile situation of our affairs at the Northward, which before this reaches you will be the main topic of conversation. Believe me this is the first day that we have had any thing from St Clair. We had a line from Schuyler of the 9th, a scrawl without head or tail, and an artful one of the 14th rec'd this day.(1) Busy as we are this matter must be searched to the bottom. A most uncommon composure has appeared in Jemmy Du and his colleague D.(2) Uncle Phil (3) is at Camp with Geary and Clyman [Clymer] to try to patch the Commissary's department, as the issuers will have their own price & customs. An attempt will be made to throw the whole fault in the Northern Department upon the New England States, whose Delegates ought to be furnished with the exact quota of our troops sent forward prior to the disaster. Genl Folsom arriving yesterday may possibly give a true history of your part.(4)  I find by a line from Dr Gardner that he had not the pleasure of seeing you in Town. I wish Mr[s] L (5) had been made happy by a second visit, though I might consequently have been a sufferer by your rogueries.  You will see I did not wait to hear of your being at Portsmouth before I took occasion to give you assurances of my esteem. I will not be backward to add proofs, whenever I think I can do it agreeably by furnishing you with any interesting intelligence. JULY 21, 1777  By a letter from Col. Brigr Lee to day I have the hope of seeing him in August early. (6) We sent to get a full representation that we may if possible confederate. Har___ n (7) obstinately pushed to lay it aside in indulgence to his State's want of a vote at present, Page being gone home. I called a hornet's nest about my ears by soberly asserting that Schuyler was beloved by the Eastern States, especially by the officers from thence, that he was the key to the Militia of Albany County, and that the Indians called him father. I asserted that I was told so six weeks ago by gentlemen of intelligence, veracity and honor. The ungrateful curs said I was satirizing and Middleton joined them.  ""

  Dear Sir, Summerville, July 21. 1777 Having lately met with an Ordinance of the King of France, passed last December, for establishing the corps of engineers I made a hasty translation of it, from which I apprehend some useful hints may be taken for establishing such a corps in this country. And as I know of no better hands into which it may be put for this purpose, I have taken the liberty to send you a copy.(1)  You are doubtless informed of the four engineers sent over by Doct. Franklin & Mr Deane, three of whom are arrived & taken into the service of the continent, the first as colonel, the second as lieutenant colonel & the third as major of engineers.(2) What probability there is of their being men of experience you will see by the enclosed ordinance and the rank they held in the royal corps of engineers. Whether their being taken into the service as Colonel &c of engineers will give them rank of those heretofore engaged simply as engineers with similar ranks will I presume be left to your determination agreeably to the r[ules] of the army.  I congratulate you on the capture of [genl] Prescot, & hope soon to hear of the release [of] genl Lee. The haughty instrument of tyranny  JULY 22, 1777  will I trust abate his insolence, at least [to ad]mit the propriety of now insisting on genl Lee's release \""when you have an officer of equal rank to offer in exchange.\"" Though I must confess, I should be very glad before any exchange even now took place, that a cartel was settled on such plain and equal principles as to remove all grounds of cavil. The board of war have had the cartel, settled between the French & English in the year 1759, lately reprinted, which you have undoubtedly seen.  I cannot forbear thinking that the posts held in the army ought to be attended as much if not more than nominal rank. Without this our enemy will have greatly the advantage. Their general officers have all regiments, so that there are but few colonels. Ought not therefore lieut colonels or even majors when they command regiments to be estimated as colonels.(3)  But I am transgressing my line and I fear trespassing on your time.

  My dear sir Philada July 22 1777 Your very acceptable Letter of the 12th came to my hand yesterday. The Confederation is most certainly an important Object, and ought to be attended to & finishd speedily.(1) I moved the other Day and urged that it might then be brought on; but your Colleague Col H (2) opposed and prevented it, Virginia not being represented. It is put off till you shall arrive; you see therefore the Necessity of your hastening to Congress.(3)  We have still further & still confused Accounts from the Northward. Schuylers Letters are rueful indeed! even to a great Degree and with such an awkward Mixture as would excite one to laugh in the Midst of Calamity. He seems to contemplate his own Happiness in not having had much or indeed any Hand in the unhappy Disaster. He throws Blame on St Clare in his Letter of July 9th. \""What adds to my Distress is that a Report prevails that I had given orders for the Evacuation of Tyonderoga, whereas not the most distant Hint of any such Intention JULY 22, 1777  can be drawn from any of my Letters to General Sinclare or any other Person whatever.\"" He adds \""What could induce the General Officers to a step that has ruind our Affairs in that Quarter, God only knows.\"" And indeed Sinclares own Letter of the 30th of June dated at Ty. would induce one to be of the same opinion, for he there says \""My People are in the best Disposition possible and I have no Doubt about giving a good Account of the Enemy should they think proper to attack us.\"" Other Parts of his Letter are written in the same spirited Stile. The General officers blame N E for not furnishing their Quota of Troops. It is natural for Parties to shift the Fault from one to the other; and your Friend General Steven, who seems desirous of clearing his Countryman from all Blame, in a Letter to your Brother says \""Eight thousand Men were thought adequate to the Purpose. They ( N E ) furnishd about three thousand, for Want of the Quota the Place is lost & they stand answerable for the consequences.\"" The General forgets that five of the ten Regiments orderd from Mass. Bay were countermanded and are now at Peeks Kill. I will give you an Abstract of the Forces at Ty & Mount Independence the 25th of June taken from the Mustermaster General Colo Varicks Return. Fit for Duty of the 9 Continental Regiments Commissiond & Noncommissiond & Staff Officers included 2738 Colo Wellss & Leonards Regiments of Militia [their time expired the 6th of July] 637 Colo Longs Regimt ofMilitia[engagd to 1st of Augt] 199 Major Stephens Corps of Artillery 151 5 Companies of Artificers 178 Whitcombs, Aldrichs & Lees Rangers 70 3973 Men at Out Posts not included in the Above 218 Sick in Camp and Barracks 342 4533 Besides a Number of Recruits belonging to the Continental Regiments arrivd at Ty. between the 18th & 29th of June, that are not included in the above Abstract, General Schuyler in his Letter of the 9th of July says, \""I am informd from undoubted Authority that the Garrison was reinforced with twelve Hundred Men at least, two days before the Evacuation.\"" When the Commander in chief writes in so positive Terms, one would presume upon his certain knowledge of Facts; but as he was not present with his Army, let us suppose (though it does not seem probable by the general gloomy Cast of his Letters) that he has overrated the Numbers, and set down 967 and it would complete the Number of 5500. Deduct the sick 342, and I am willing also to deduct the two \""licentious and disorderly\"" Regiments from Massachusetts who left Sinclare, though he acknowledges they kept with him two days upon  the March, and there remaind near five thousand. Mentioning this yesterday in a publick Assembly, I was referrd to the Generals Information to his Council of War, who says \""the whole of our Force consisted of two thousand & Eighty nine effective Rank & file.\"" But allowing this to be the Case, Is an Army the worse for having more than one half of its Combatants Officers?  Notwithstanding Nothing is said of it in the publick Letters Genl Sinclair writes to his private Friend that the Enemy came up with the Rear of the retreating Army, & a hot Engagement ensued, other Accounts say that many were killed on both sides, that our Troops beat off the Enemy & that Colo Francis of the Massachusetts & some of his officers were among the slain.(4)  I shall not write you any more Letters for I hope to see you soon.

  D Sir Philadelphia July 22d. 1777 I waited some time for the Inteligence from Ticonderoga which you will find in the inclosed paper, and I declined writing until I could give you particulars because I did not chuse to put you on disagreeable Speculation.  Many of us have long expected that Ticonderoga would be evacuated at the Approach of an Enemy because we had no hopes of having a force there competent to its defense. We have mistaken much, in my Opinion, our Line of conduct in these matters. We have relied too much on Fortifications without sufficient force or discipline to defend them. Our Troops in general make no resistance when they are cooped up within Lines and assailed on all sides, and experience has Convinced the World that even Veteran Troops prove unequal to such a Trial. To wait firm and determined to Sustain the Shock of an Enemy charging from all sides is an Effort of Fortitude that very few armies have ever been found equal to, and it Seems to me not very wise to expect it in our raw and undisciplined Armies. Our own Experience too is Sufficient to Instruct us in avoiding this kind of battle, for therein the Enemy is always superior to us and in desultary war we are always superior to them. We shall now dispute the Country with the Enemy, and I hope with more Success than we defend fortifications.  General How is still inactive at New York and Staten Island, and General Washington with a superior army is ready to oppose him whichever way he moves.  Mr Harnett arrived here on Friday night last but has not yet been able to go into Congress.

  Dear sir Philada. July 22d. 1777 The honour you did me at Chantilly the 12th came yesterday to my knowledge. Your just reflections served to recall a chagrin which I had sensibly felt at the time of debating the Commissions refered to.(1) Those, like the Confederation, are martyred to the change in Delegation which takes place between the periods of second and third distant discussions upon the same point. The obstinate Vanity of N[or]th C[arolina] and the persevering Design of N.Y. have been reinforced by the ill timed Bodings & Frosty Caution of C[onnecticu]t.  I will not say much upon the Events in the northern department. Your well founded prophesies six weeks ago will have tended to blount the edge of this cutting misfortune.  As Mr. Adams & your worthy Brother will have the opportunity of getting minute facts from papers at the board of war, I presume their letters at this time will be lengthy.  I find the N England States are to be pointed out as the sole cause of the retreat from Ty.  I shall put my Friends in Boston upon a thorough scrutiny for their own honour. Though Genl. Stevens makes a number of very alleviating remarks to your Brother as to the Consequences of this Loss, yet he is full as to the Cause of it against my Country.  \""That Post was esteemed of interesting consequence to the States of N.

But such Curosities as these are visable in the Letters & returns.

It gave me not a little Satisfaction to hear of your Welfare, that of our dear Children & Connections. God grant this may find you all in health & safety. It was impossible for me to write you; my right arm which you know has been  JULY 22, 1777  affected with the Rheumatism has been tenfold worse than ever, the pain at first fell suddenly into my wrist, sweld & became exceedingly painful, & after some Time returnd back to my Elbow & was worse than before & my whole arm was inexpressibly sore & painful from my Shoulder to my hand so that I cod not dress, undress nor sleep for some time, but by the mercy of God, & his blessing, it is much better but not perfectly well, & I fear it may return. Am able to write, tho have nothing very material to say. We are at present in the same Lodgings which Col Dyer used when He was formerly here, tho not occupied by the same Family. The House swarms with French men, part of the seventy odd Mr Dean has sent over &c tho we have very little to do with them save at Breakfast Time, we keep our Chambers pretty much & are Company for Selves, tho Mr Law is obligd to sleep in a lower bedroom, & at suppers. I have nothing to do & we dine by our Selves, abt 4 or 5 oClock. The swearing & Wickedness that abounds in this City is truly shocking to chaste Ears & alarming in a moral View, the Judgments of God don't seem to have any Effect, unless the most awful one, of rendering us worse. I tremble to think so, but I really fear it is true, will he that made us, shew mercy to such a People ? His Mercy is boundless, & infinite. I will yet hope in it nor Limit the Holy one of Israel. O, that Wickedness was confined to this City. Alass I fear 'tis as great in N. England & thro the Country. When I was here last Summer & heard of the Defeats at N York, the Northward &c I thot it was impossible but it shod alarm our Countrymen & awaken them to turn to him that smote Them but I found it far otherwise. Alass, the Chastisements of his Providence will have good Effect without the inward teaching of his Spirit, but God is pleased to withhold those Influences, the most sore & distressing of all Calamities. O, that every Soul who has an Interest in Heaven wod cry day & night with ceaseless & unfailing ardor, that God wod pour out his blessed Spirit to awaken & bring the Country to Repentance. Too few I fear think of the infinite importance of that Blessing even without any regard to our present Calamities. But what can I say or Do. God will work as pleaseth Him.  Among the other Sins that prevail here extortion & oppression is not the least, & it is by the wicked Arts of our internal Enemys here brot to such a pass, tis hardly possible to tell the price of their Shop Goods. There are many Goods here & yet They keep the Prices at the most extravagent sums. I believe Linnens I used to sell at abt 2/ are 20/ & more, Tea £8, the pound, dirty base brown Sugar 5/ & more, Loaf 10/, rum 45/ the lowest the Gallon, Molasses, my drink with Water 6/ a quart, butter in market 5/ & 6/ the pound, beaf 2/6 & every thing in proportion & daily rising, & will rise, unless our affairs in infinite mercy shod take another turn. I believe tis not best to mention these things lest it shod still add to our own distresses of the same kind, but be very careful of what little stores We have. It will be too late or I shod ask  you to be careful of rum to Mowers &c. Surely They shod be content with very little &c.  I regret my absence & long to be with my dear Wife, Children & Friends, but there is no peace there, & I must stand in my Lot & wait the Will of God, & his appointed Time. If He shall ever bring me home again in Peace, I hope I shall not forget Jacobs Vow. May God be gracious to you & the dear Children, little do They know what I feel for Them. I wish to hear from you of every thing even the least Incidents. The last We heard from the army They were at Clove, abt 12 or more miles from Morris Town toward Peekskill, to be as ready as They can to move up the river or to this Place as the designs of the Enemy shod appear. It is very uncertain whether they do not intend to have this City, & many things look much like it. If They shod I hope We shall find a place of Safety, & that it will prove a trap & Snare to them & trust it will. It is very surprizing We hear no more from Schuyler. Have nothing but the confused Acco. That Ty. is gone & all the Stores &c &c. I dare say your Father (1) has better Intelligence. This is another sad Token of Gods anger but We dont lay it to heart.

  Sir, Philadelphia 24th July [1777] So long ago as Decr. 2d 1775 direction was given by Congress to the committee of secret correspondence to procure from Europe four good Engineers This was not however accomplished till the 13th of last Febry., when the bearer the Chevalier du Portail, with Mr. La Radiere, Mr. Gouvion and one other Officer who is left sick in the West indies, was engaged by Doctor Franklin & Mr. Deane to come over to America.(1)  I beg your Excellency to observe well that these are the only Officers, of any species, who have been procured from abroad by express direction of Congress And this I do because I am about to furnish you with several circumstances peculiarly within my knowledge relative to a point of equity well worthy of your Excellency's attention. The corps of Engineers is very honorable in France; and officers from it are sought by different European Powers. These Gentlemen who are come over into our service made an agreement with our Commissioners to rise one JULY 24, 1777  degree from the rank they held at home, upon a supposition that the practice of Europe had been regarded here. But when they arrived, they found instances very different with respect to officers in all other corps. It was their mishap also to see a Major of artillery affecting to be exalted four ranks, as a Chief in his proper line and theirs also. They made a representation of these circumstances & appealed to the Equity of Congress. But, they had arrived at a time when the Infatuation of some here and the wild conduct of one abroad had rendered a spirit of reformation absolutely necessary as to the point of rank. The Ingenuous, however, must own that there is singular hardship in the case of these gentlemen. The only officers ever sent for by us-procured by the real political agents of Congress-coming out with the good wishes of the French Ministry-being of undoubted rank & ability in their profession, find themselves in the Dilemma of becoming the first examples of our new reforming Spirit, or else of going home during a Campaign, which their high sense of honor will not allow. But, tho' the Chevalier du Portail was not made a Brigadier, yet it appeared too gross to expose him to be directed in his peculiar line by such as will readily acknowledge his pretensions by regular education & discipline to be greatly superior to their own. His commission prevents this, and enables him so to distribute, in work, the others who came with him, as to prevent them, who have been within a few months as long in service as himself, from being interfered with by such as never belonged to the royal corps of Engineers in France or perhaps but a very short time to any other. Your Excellency cannot but wonder at the strange manner of wording the commission. I shall explain it with the greatest freedom. Mr. Du Coudray being employed as a good artillery officer to examine the arsenals in France to see what cannon &c could be spared from them acted with great Industry in that employment and much seeming regard to America. In the course of his transactions between the Ct. de St Germain & Mr. Deane, he was not blind to perceive that he might take occasion to serve himself Besides being paid for his trouble & Expenses in France he procured an agreement from Mr. Deane wch has already been shown to yr. Excellency, and has affected you, doubtless, with the same surprize & indignation which it has excited in others, almost without a single exception. I shall omit any remarks upon that treaty, or a long too-ingenious memorial presented to Congress with it, except such as are strictly connected with the occasion of this letter. Mr. Du C. having erected himself to the Command of Artillery and Engineers persuaded Mr. Dean that it will be impossible to get any from the military corps of Engineers now called royal because their Demands would be so exorbitant; and that it would be also unnecessary, because we ought not to build fortified Places in America to serve as secure Holds to our Enemy when once taken from us; and that therefore, a few Bridge e Causeway-makers would answer all the ends of military Engineers.   Such he brought with him, who were quite ready to fall under the command of an artillery direction: when not the lowest officer of the royal corps of Engineers would have submitted to such a novel pretension. It is needless to enquire whether it be true that Mr. Deane acknowledged he had been surprised into his uncouth compact. It is sufficient that Doctr. Franklin made an after one, which Mr. Deane also signed. Is not this in fact tantamount to a disavowal of the first treaty so far as relates to the orders of Congress? For, if those orders were fullfilled by the first, why was a second treaty made? The Agents show that there had been a deception; or that there had not been any attempt to follow the instructions of congress as to Engineers, in all the train attending Mr. Du C---. Another remark may not be impertinent here. As these four Engineers showed their treaty to the Count de St. Germain to whom they have also written from hence, it cannot be supposed that he would have permitted a Lt. Collo. of the royal corps of Engineers & two old Majors of the same to come over hither, to be under the immediate command of a young Major of Artillery. It is not to be conceived. From whence, I conclude that Mr. Du C never let his exorbitant & whimsical treaty be known to that Minister of the War-Department, who must have been shocked at the confusion of corps in the principles of the contract. Excuse me, dear General, I will not again wander from the points which I said I would explain. Mr. DuC--has given full scope to his species of Ingenuity here as in the Neighbourhood of Mr. Deane. I have been told that he has said, if he could not be employed himself he would bring it about that these others should not. This may be an absolute Falsehood. But, I will own it comes the nearest of any thing, which I can conceive of, to explain the delays which have taken place in regard to these Engineers, who ought to have been sent to your Excellency long ago. They have remained subject to the crucifying expences of this city, because their employment seemed to interfere with Mr. DuCoudray's Pretensions, tho' those very Pretensions had been rejected. Your Excellency would doubtless smile if you should ever hear that even a number of Peasants disputed 3 days about the difference between the consequences of a man's being Colonel in Chief, or First Colonel, or Colonel to take rank & Command of all heretofore appointed, or Colonel Commandant of Engineers. Would not a Brigadier or Major General of Engineers alike annul the supremacy of the differently worded commissions? Or rather, do not the 4 different modes give like command? I shall pass from rank to pay. These Gentlemen not only far from the prophesied exorbitancy in demand of rank, never received one shilling in France as Gratification tho' others who were not sent for received large sums and claim pay from their embarkation and even pensions for life. But Doctr. Franklin, supposing it would be less trouble to himself and more agreeable to the Engineer to see to their own passages, stipulated their pay from the 13th  of Febry. As no Regulations have yet been made in regard to Cavalry or Engineers, these Gentlemen have received 5 months pay as Infantry; which will not refund the expense of their voyage. I am really uneasy when I find manly honourable Intentions do not meet with at least equal emoluments with artful suspicious tricking contractors. If these Officers do not walk to camp, it is not because they were furnished by the Board of war with horses upon my application for them. And yet the nature of their Profession demands a provission of this Kind. Are they suddenly to reconnoitre a Camp, a River, a Shoar, or a whole neighbouring country thro' which an army is to march, and to make the speediest returns to the Generals, on foot? I trust your Excellency when asking for Engineers had Ideas of something beyond what the sinister views of an ambitious foreigner has sought to inspire us with here; which is forming a causeway or cutting a ditch or planking a bridge. And I shall consequently rest satisfied that you will receive the Officers now presenting themselves to you, and secure to them such honours and emoluments as you shall find them to merit from their education & abilities exemplified under your command.  No one has been more backward then I in desiring to see foreigners in our service, to the slight of my countrymen. And, except Engineers, I could not admit the thought of our wanting any military strangers other than one or two veteran adjutants or Majors, who knew our language well, and could serve as instructors-at-large to our spirited and well attached young American Officers.  I wish these Engineers could speak English better than they do; but they can receive orders & give them in English, and will speedily learn to speak.  I hope your Excellency will not think amiss of the freedom I have taken at this time both as to the matter of my letter & the interruptive length of it. I do not write officially, as of the Committee on foreign Applications. In that capacity I have more than once communicated to you the proceedings of Congress in a stile which might lead you to misconjecture my individual opinion. I write as a Friend to my Country and the Reputation of it's Congress its Army & its Agents abroad. I write as being well acquainted with your Excellency, or, in other words, as thinking I know you. In short, I write because I had determined it to be my Duty so to write. That path once determined, I never ask myself whether there may not be a Lion in the way.  After the important kindnesses which your Excellency has done me, I so far forgive the late injury of your apologizing for a short answer written by one of your hurried family, as not to revenge myself, by intreating you to excuse my rough uncopied sheets to a violent headache.  Aliquando dormitat did not appear an unnatural charge against Homer. Nimium vigilat would have appeared so against Scipio or   Marlbrough, and yet I am led by you to think they might have given provocation for it.(2)  With truest vows for your prosperity, I am, Your Excellency's Obliged Friend & humble Servant, James Lovell  ""

  Dear Sir(1) Philadelphia 25 July 1777. The inclosed News papers contain all the Public Intelligence known in this Place except that Genl. Washington was three days ago at a Place call'd Clove where he had march'd to watch the motions of the Enemy. The Sailing of the Fleet will put him also in motion, but in what Direction? is the important Question. Conjectures are as upon all such occasions various. Some look towards the Capes of Delaware and others say New England is to be attacked on all sides. Chesapeak Bay is talk'd of, and there are [those] who think Carolina or Georgia as likely to be an Object notwithstanding the Season of the Year, as any Place. Be that as it may, when so important an Armament is on the March I think every State shd be alarm'd and therefore I proposed yesterday morning to my Colleagues to send an express Messenger for that purpose to Charles Town but they were not of my opinion.  JULY 25, 1777  I catch this opportunity by mere accident, pray present my Compliments to the President, to Mr & Mrs Manigault, to Mrs Gervais and to every body you think proper. I arrived here the 20th. J. Laurens will begin his Journey to the Army this morning. J. Ball, his Man and my George were innoculated for Small Pox the 21st. Pray communicate this with my Respects to his Father and Brother. I shall in two or three days have another opportunity of assuring you &c.  I should have excepted of Public Intelligence that our Fleet of Zebeques and Galleys lie ready in the River for a concerted Expedition below, upon which they wd have sail'd before this time but for an improper Demand of Increase of Wages made by the Lieutenants 12 in number. The Congress orderd them immediately to be dismiss'd the Service under a Resolution rendring them incapable of serving in any of the States in any Capacity, civil or Military. This Resolution produced humble Petitions from the whole. They are now reinstated and I suppose Business will go forward again.(2) A Combination of Sargeons in the fleet treated in the same manner.(3)  ""

On my joining the Congress I found them wourid with Petitions from a grate Number of French gentlemen for commissions to serve in our army-to be made generals & none less then colonels & that our agents in France & General Washington in the camp were not less troubled with them.  The first oppurtunity we had we presented the Petition of Mr. Phillbrook & that of our State to the Consideration of Congress which was referred to the treasury board & this morning we arre to have a hearing before them. By what we Can learn from the Members & the exhausted State of the Treasury, at this Time we despair of Success on the Petition of the State, tho it seems to be the wish of Congress that the same thing which is asked by us might be done with each of the thirteen united States.

  My dear Son Philadelphia July 27. 1777  If it should be the Design of Providence that you should live to grow up, you will naturally feel a Curiosity to learn the History of the Causes which have produced the late Revolution of our Government. No Study in which you can engage will be more worthy of you.  It will become you to make yourself Master of all the considerable Characters, which have figured upon the Stage of civil, political or military Life. This you ought to do with the Utmost Candour, Benevolence and Impartiality, and if you should now and then meet with an Incident, which shall throw some Light upon your Fathers Character, I charge you to consider it with an Attention only to Truth.  It will also be an entertaining and instructive Amusement, to compare our American Revolution with others that Resemble it. The whole Period of English History, from the Accession of James the first, to the Accession of William the third, will deserve your most critical Attention.  The History of the Revolutions in Portugal, Sweeden and Rome by the Abbot de Vertot, is well worth your Reading.(1)  The Seperation of the Helvetic Confederacy from the Dominion of the House of Austria, is also an illustrious Event, that particularly resembles our American Struggle with Great Britain.  But above all others, I would recommend to your study, the History of the Flemish Confederacy, by which the seven united Provinces of the Netherlands, emancipated themselves from the Domination of Spain.  There are several good Histories of this great Revolution. Sir William Temples is short but elegant, and entertaining. Another Account of this Period was written by Puffendorf, and another by Grotius.  But the most full and compleat History, that I have seen, is one that I am now engaged in Reading. It is intituled \""The History of the Wars of Flanders, written in Italian by that learned and famous Cardinal Bentivoglio, englished by the Right Honourable Henry Earl of Monmouth, the whole Work illustrated, with a Map of the seventeen Provinces and above twenty Figures of the chief Personages mentioned in the History.\""  Bentivoglio, like Clarendon, was a Courtier, and on the side of Monarchy and the Hierarchy. But Allowances must be made for that.  JULY 27, 1777  The first Cut is of Guido, S.R.E. Cardinalis Bentivolus.  2. The Emperor Charles the 5th. Prince of the low Countries.  3. Phillip the 2d. King of Spain, Prince of the low Countries.  4. William of Nassau, Prince of Orange.  5. Margarett Dutchesse of Parma and Piacenza, Daughter to Charles the 5th. Governesse of the low Countries.  6. Elizabeth Queen of England, France and Ireland.  7. Anthony Perenott Cardinal Granvel, Councillor of state to Margarett of Parma.  8. Peter Ernest Count Mansfeldt Governor of Luxemburg.  9. William Lodowic Count Nassau, Governor of Frisland.  10. John Lignius, Count Aremberg, Governor of Frisland, General at the Battle of Hilligal.  11. Ferdinand of Toledo Duke of Alva, Governor of the Low Countries.  12. Sancho Avila Governor of the Fort, at Antwerp, General at the Battle of Mooch.  13. Chiapino Vitelli Marquiss of Cetona, Camp Master General.  14. Robert Lord Dudley Earl of Leicester, Governor of the united Provinces.  15. Maximillian Hennin Count Bossu, Governor of Holland and Utrecht.  16. Lodovico Requesenes, Great Commandador of Castile, Governor of the Low Countries.  17. Phillip Croy Duke of Areschot, Knight of the golden Fleece, Governor of Flanders.  18. Don John of Austria, son to Charles 5th. Governor of the Low Countries .  19. Mathias, Archduke of Austria, Duke of Burgundy and Governor of the united Provinces.  20. Alexander Farnese, Prince of Parma, Governor of the low Countries.  21. Francis Hercules De Valois, Duke of Anjou, Alencon, Brabant and Protector of the Netherlands.  22. Phillip Count Holach, Baron of Langenberg, first General of the united Provinces.  23. Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange, Count Nassau, Governor of the united Provinces.  24. Adolphus Solm Count de Meurs, Governor of Gelderland and Utrecht.  There are three most memorable Seiges described in this History, those of Haerlem, Leyden, and Antwerp.  You will wonder, my dear son, at my writing to you at your tender Age, such dry Things as these: but if you keep this Letter you will in  some future Period, thank your Father for writing it.

Most fervently do I pray, for a Continuance of his Goodness in the compleat Restoration of my best Friend to perfect Health.  Is it not unaccountable, that one should feel so strong an Affection for an Infant, that one has never seen, nor shall see? Yet I must confess to you, the Loss of this sweet little Girl, has most tenderly and sensibly affected me. I feel a Grief and Mortification, that is heightened tho it is not wholly occasioned, by my Sympathy with the Mother. My dear little Nabbys Tears are sweetly becoming her generous Tenderness and sensibility of Nature. They are Arguments too of her good sense and Discretion.  ""

  My dear sir Philade July 28 1777 I receiv'd your favor of the 26th of June and also one from Col Crafts of the same Date.(1) I wrote to him by the Return of the Post & desired him to communicate the Contents to you.(2) I conversd with Mr. J A upon the Subject of your Letter, and we venturd, both of us, to step out of the Line of strict order in a debate in Congress, the other day, to bring your Regiment of Artillery into View. It occasiond a Conversation in the House in which we had an opportunity of acquainting the Members of the long Standing of that Regiment & the Seniority of its Officers. But still it was considerd as a Regiment raisd by a State & not by the Continent. And though we caused the Merit of it to be well-understood &  JULY 28, 1777  it was acknowledgd in the House the Difficulty of altering the Regulations you refer to appeard so evidently in the Minds of the gentlemen, that we waved making any Motion at that time, because we apprehended that the Issue would be unfavorable. Indeed I arn of Opinion that Congress will not be induced to make the Alteration you wish for, until it shall become a Continental Regiment. In that Case, I am apt to think there would be no Difficulty with Regard to the Seniority of other Regiments which have been raisd since, over yours. But till that is done, it is feared that an Alteration in this Instance would cause Discontent in other States, where it is said there are Instances similar A Regiment of Artillery rais'd in this State under Command of Colo Procter was lately taken into Continental Service and the Commissions were dated at the time they were raisd. It was upon this Occasion that Colo Craft's Regiment was mentiond; and I suppose that Regiment wd be admitted on the same terms.(3) But I think I foresee an insuperable Obstacle in that Case. If any thing can be done consistently with the general Service, to shew Honor, but especially to do Justice to the Regiment of Artillery in Boston, I shall not fail to push it as far as I may have Influence. My fellow Citizens well know that I have never been indifferent to them. I am thought here in a great Degree partial in their Favour. I have in particular a Predilection for that Regiment. But my Friend, let me intreat you and the Gentlemen of your Core, above all other feelings to cherish those of the virtuous Citizen. I will allow that the Ambition of the Soldier is laudable. At such a Crisis as this it is necessary. But may it not be indulgd to Excess! This War we hope will be of short Duration. We are contending not for Glory, but for the Liberty, Safety & Happiness of our Country.

  My dear Friend: [Philadelphia] 29th July 1777 I have experienced extreme uneasiness in not hearing from you since the loss of Ticonderoga, and hardly know how to account for your silence. Your enemies in this quarter are leaving no means unessayed to blast your character, and impute to your appointment in that Department, a loss which, when rightly investigated can be imputed to very different causes. The friends to truth find an extreme difficulty to stem the torrent of a calumny.  Be not surprised if you should be desired to attend Congress to give an account of the loss of Ticonderoga. With respect to the result of an enquiry I am under no apprehensions. Like gold tried in the fire, I trust that you my dear Friend will be found more pure, and bright than ever.  There is but one thing for you to do, to establish your Character on such a basis that even suspicion itself shall be silent, and in doing this, you will I am concious follow the impulse of your own heart. From the nature of your Department, and other unavoidable causes you have not during the course of this war had an opportunity of evincing that spirit which I and your more intimate friends know you to possess. Of this circumstance prejudice takes a cruel advantage, and malice lends an JULY 29, 1777  easy ear to her dictates. A hint on this subject is sufficient. You will not I am sure see this place till your conduct gives the lie to this insinuation, as it has done before to every other which your enemies have so industriously circulated. Genl. Washington has lately transmitted to Congress a late letter of yours to him.(1) I know the strong coloring used in it was done with a design to induce him to reinforce you with Continental troops, the only sure dependence in opposing the enemy's army. You know Congress like an hysteric woman want cordials. Write truths, without making any reflections of your own. When you call to mind what conversation has passed betwixt you and Mr. Duane on this subject, you will understand what I mean without my enlarging further.  My dear Schuyler, if you knew how warm an interest your friends have in whatever concerns your reputation and happiness you would spare time to write them fully and frequently. I entreat you by the ties of our long acquaintance not to be silent, at least to myself. May heaven preserve you, and may I shortly see you crowned with Laurels, or may I have an opportunity (should fate decide for the worse) to rescue your memory from the cruel assasinations of wicked men, who are endeavoring by every artifice in their power to raise the popular clamor against you, and your friends, in order to divert the public attention from the true source of our misfortunes in your quarter.

  My dear sir July 29th. 1777. Perhaps it is from my attachment to N England that I do not give into the Determination that How is certainly coming into the Delaware with his Fleet wch. has appeared off the Capes, but I still imagine he has other Designs. I hope the Alarm List in the Eastern States will be ready to give amusement & opposition to him if he should take a turn that way, till they shall be joined by continental Troops. For tho we have not near the Army voted to be in the field, yet you may be assured we have a fine body, in good Spirits and giving signs of the best Discipline, as our Committee just returned from Camp affirm, among friends, for it is thought best to say little yet. There were in the Jersies and at Peaks Kill 18,000 besides Cavalry & many troops which were not in the Rolls but wch. we know have since gone or are at work on this River making upwards of 20,000. I think just at present this should  JULY 29, 1777  not be public. If Howe is coming here it is under circumstances more in favour of Philada. than will again happen. The brave Jersey Militia who have been baulked of fighting at home as much as they wish will be as good or better here than continental; the last fight from duty, the first from a spirit of revenge.  The States General of Holland made a too humble reply to York's saucy remonstrance, and Lord Suffolk was sarcastic to Count Welderen in a responsive letter of the 10th of April in which he tells the Count that his Majesty's Expectations are fulfilled by the Recall of De Graaf & a disavowal of the insult complained of. (1) People in Holland & elsewhere are dissatisfied with the Humility of their High Mightinesses.  From the report of an English pacquet being taken & carried to France, we are wishing to hear from our Commissioners more than usually. It cannot be long I think before we shall have a vessel from France. The southern Coast is too much used; our eastern Country affords more certain ports. I shall be punctual in letting yr.

  My Dear Sir, July 29th 1777 With most hearty wishes for the health and happiness of you and your's, I acknowledge the receipt of a kind proof of your remembrance of me dated the 15th. Your ideas about Ticonderoga you will find by my letters of last Tuesday are similar to those which we had here.(1) But will you believe that the same obstinacy which withstood the sending Schuyler to Head Quarters in the Jersies 7 weeks ago, now- also withstands calling him hither to give an account of our affairs in the Northern Department and of the causes of the relinquishment of Inde- JULY 29, 1777  pendence, to say nothing of the Western part. He writes that the Tories will all join Burgoyne and the timid Whigs and Six Nations of Indians and that the Eastern Militia will not stay with him; yet we are not to send a more fighting popular General in his place. Just such contradictory letters as you and your brother mention, we received here. If the Eastern States do not muster all possible proofs that they have done as well at least as others, a number in Congress with the Northern Council of War and Schuyler, and more than one in the Jersies, will cry out \""New England alone is to blame.\""  In addition to the perplexities which I have before mentioned to you about French Treaties made by Deane we have a fresh quantity from the arrival of 2 Majors General, two Brigadiers, 2 Lt Cols, 2 Majors, 3 Captains and two Lts created and ranked 7th Nov last and 1st of Decr to whom have been advanced 16,000 livs 1/2 gratuity & half pay (2) Ought not this weak or roguish man to be recalled; (3) if as a corresponding Agent he did thus, what will not he think himself entitled to do as a Commissioner! General Washington is coming this way with his forces some of which are actually in this City already. Howe's fleet are off the Capes 250 sail. I should not wonder if he tried to draw the General even to Virginia and then pushed for New England, that great object of Ministerial malice I expect he will do this or make a quick return up North river. I shall not believe he will now come here; he must attempt it before he leaves America, but he may watch much better opportunities than the present. I think he ought now to alarm your Sea-coast, while Burgoyne is on the Frontiers. Two or three days will determine the matter.  ""

But the misfortunes in the Northern Department, and the fresh attack which is made upon General Schuyler in consequence of them, renew our Difficulties. The Eastern States openly affirm that their Troops have no Confidence in General Schuyler and assign this as the Reason that they have not marched to his Assistance. They therefore insist that he as well as Genl. St. Clair shall be recalled and General Gates again appointed to the Command: or that Congress must Take upon themselves all the Consequences which JULY 29, 1777  may attend a Refusal of this Proposition. You see Gentlemen the Delicacy of our Situation. If the Eastern Delegates carry their point the World is left to conclude not only that General Schuyler is unworthy of the Command; but that if the late changes had not taken place, Ticonderoga, by the abilities of Genl Gates, might still have been preserved.  In what Light your Delegates & the State by whose Authority they interposd will be represented, on this View of the Case, is sufficiently obvious. But supposing General Schuyler, after this warm application for his Removal, shoud be continued in the Command, and the Eastern States be backward in supplying their militia, and the calamities of the Country in that Quarter encrease, Would there under these circumstances, be any End to Clamour and Reproach ?

  My dearest Friend Philadelphia July 30. 1777 I am sorry to find by your late Letter what indeed I expected to hear, that my Farm wants manure. I fear by your Expressions that your Crop of Hay falls short.  But, there has been an Error in our Husbandry in which We have been very inconsiderate and extravagant, that is in pasturing the Mowing Ground. This will ruin any Farm.  The true Maxim of profitable Husbandry is to contrive every Means for the Maintenance of Stock. Increase your Cattle and inrich your Farm. We bestow too much manure upon Corn-too little upon Grass. Make Manure, make food for Cattle, increase your stock-this is the Method.  JULY 30, 1777  Howes Fleet has been at Sea, these 8 days. We know not where he is gone. We are puzzling ourselves in vain, to conjecture his Intention. Some guess he is gone to Cheasapeak, to land near Susquehanna and cross over Land to Albany to meet Burgoine. But they might as well imagine them gone round Cape horn into the South Seas to land at California, and march across the Continent to attack our back settlements.  Others think them gone to Rhode Island, others think they mean only a Deception and to return to the North River. A few days will reveal their Scheme. (1)  We have now before Us, the Months of August, September, October and November, for the Operations of the Campaign. Time enough for Mischief.

  Dr Sir Philadelphia July 30th 1777 Altho. I expected by this time a very active Eventful scene yet I have scarcely anything to communicate to you worth your attention; for near a week past the enemy have been expected here, and preparations are made for effectively opposing them, but there is yet no appearance of them. What gives rise to the apprehension is that a fleet of Men of War and Transports amounting to upwards of two hundred sail departed from Sandy Hook on Tuesday Last, and steered southeast, having on board Troops, horses, artillery &c in great quantity. This appearance has convinced all who deemed this City their peculiar object, that their destination was for the River Delaware, and even such as have always thought otherwise feel their opinions now wavering: they can see no other probable object, and are therefore constrained to admit that it must be Philadelphia. For my own part, I am still of opinion that they will co-operate with their Forces from Canada in endeavouring to effect a junction and establishing a line of communication between the sea and the Lakes, so as to divide the Continent, and bar all succours from one part to the other, while their operations are carried on against either. But why should I trouble you with my conjectures? Time alone can discover what they intend; and as neither we nor they can govern events, there is no foreseeing what they will do.  No new accounts have arrived from the Northern Department since my last. Our affairs there give us great uneasiness. The loss was cer- JULY 30, 1777  tainly occasioned by the want of sufficient well appointed force, and as the Eastern States were to supply the Troops for that station, they are very solicitous that it should be thought the fault of the officers, who in reality could not have done more than they did with the force in their hands. They are unwilling that it should be thought they have not the force they have always pretended to; and altho' it must be and is admitted they have exerted themselves as much as any States, yet they are very unwilling to admit that any of our misfortunes has happened through a weakness which they only share in common with the rest. The result I suppose will be that the Officers must be unjustly disgraced. Upon the whole of our affairs, they bear rather a promising aspect, and could we, by general taxing, or any other means, establish the credit of our money, every campaign would give us more command of the war. I shall not trouble you, Sir, with any more at present. I have the honor to be, with the greatest respect & esteem, Your obt Sert.  Thos Burke ""

  My dear Sir Philade July 31 1777 It is a long time since I had the pleasure of a Letter from you. I have not heard your opinion of the Evacuation of Tionderoga.(1) You are doubtless as much chagrind as I am. It is ascribd to different Causes. Congress is determind that the true Reasons shall be enquired into, & the Conduct of the General officers. Schuylers Freinds are endeavoring to clear him from all Blame, because, say they, he was not there. This is true. And as it was well known he had never been used to keep his own Person near his Army, perhaps it may be pertinently asked, Why he was pitchd upon to take the Command. Your Delegates, I can assure you, were utterly against it. And, notwithstanding it was publishd in one of the Boston News papers, said to be warrented by a Letter from this City, that General Schuyler had the entire Confidence of Congress, there were five only of Eleven States present, in favor of it. The Paper I think was of the 5th of June. (2) I wish I could know who gave the Letter to the Printer. In order, I suppose, to give Credit to that Letter, there was another Publication in the Papers here, informing the World, that when he set off to the Northern Department, he was accompanied by the President and other Members of Congress, which I take for granted is true. These are trifling political Mancevres similar to those which we have formerly seen practied in the Massachusetts Bay, when a Prop was wanted for a sinking Character. You may think them not worth your  JULY 31, 1777  Notice; Excuse my troubling you with them. Cunning Politicians often make use of the Names of Persons, & sometimes of the Persons themselves, who have not the least Suspicion of it, to serve their own designs. When I mentioned five out of Eleven I should have explaind my self. There were five States for the Measure, four against and two divided.(3) Had not the State of Rhode Island been at that Juncture accidentally unrepresented, there would have been an equal Division, and the Measure would have been prevented. The most important Events may sometimes depend upon small Circumstances. Some Gentlemen of the State of N Y are exceedingly attachd to G Schuyler. They represent him as Instar Omnium in the Northern Department. After all that has been said, I concieve of him, as I have for a long time, excellently well qualified for a Commissary or Quartermaster. The N E Delegates were (perhaps one excepted) to a Man against his having the Command of that Army. But of this I will write particularly in another Letter.  I am not willing to prejudge, but I must say, it is difficult to reconcile the sudden Evacuation of Ty. with the previous flattering Letters of General St Clare. In one of his Letters written but a few days before he says \""My People are in the best Disposition possible and I have no Doubt about giving a good Account of the Enemy if they shall think proper to attack us.\"" He has been esteemd here a good officer and in his Letter he bespeaks the Candor of the Publick till he can be heard. Pains will be taken to lay the Blame upon the N E States, for not furnishing their Quota of Men. I wish therefore you would procure for me an authentick Account of the Number of Men, both regular and Militia sent to the Northward from our State, and how they were cloathd and armd. You may remember that Congress recommended to the Eastern States, some time I think in December last, to send a Reinforcement of Militia to Tionderoga to remain there till they could be replacd by Continental Troops then raising. I have never been informd of the Effect of that Recommendation, or if I have I do not recollect it.(4) Pray put it in our Power to state Facts precisely as far as they regard our State. It is agreed on all sides that a Fault lies some where. I hope the Truth will be thoroughly investigated, & to use the homely Proverb, the Saddle laid on the right Horse.  We are looking every moment for the Arrival of the Enemy in this River. Two hundred & 55 Sail were seen on Wednesday last steering from the Hook South East. Seventy Sail were seen from the Shore near Egg Harbour about 20 Leagues from these Capes on Saturday last steering the same Course. The Wind against them. They could not come here at a better time. Genl W. is drawing his Troops into this Neighborhood. Some of them are arrivd. But as the Enemy has the Advantage of us by Sea, it is too easy for them to oblige us to harrass our Troops by long and fruitless Marches, and I should not wonder to hear that they have tackd about and gone Eastward. I hope my Countrymen are pre-  pared Let brotherly Love continue. Adieu. Pay my friendly Respects to your Lady & family.  [P.S.] Write particularly in another Letter.  ""

  My Dear Sir, (In confidence) Friday August 1st 1777. You will easily guess that some of your friends here have had a task indeed to get so much justice done to the public as to call Schuyler and St Clair, Poor, Patterson and Fermoy to Head Quarters, and direct General W to send a proper officer to command in the Northern Department-hot work from last Saturday.  These recalls were prefaced the 29th of July by a Resolve that an enquiry be made into the reasons of the evacuation of Tyconderoga and Mount Independence and into the conduct of the General Officers who were in the Northern Department at the time of the evacuation.  Committee to digest and report a mode of conducting the enquiry- Col Lawrence, South Carolina, a worthy member, J Adams, Col Dyer, General Roberdeau and General Fulsom.  I doubt not Gates will be sent, and I hope the militias of New England will do justice to our labors, by turning out and behaving well. The unpopularity of the Northern Commander has been declared a bar to our hopes-therefore the change.(1)  Before this reaches you, it will be fully decided whether the enemy intend for Philadelphia. General Washington seemed this morning not to doubt it. I found him in good health and much relieved by finding repeated proofs of what he has for a long time been most inclined to believe were the views of Howe.  I am your friend and Servant, J.L.  10 at night  Since writing the foregoing, we are told the enemy's fleet has left the Capes, and steered Eastward. You cannot think I am pleased with this,  AUGUST 2, 1777  because I had prophesied it. No indeed, I wished them to come here, though I declared I would not believe they were coming till they had landed some of their artillery.  They will kill our army by a march to New England in this cruel hot season. All are baulked much both Whigs and Tories.  We had recommended to the Council of State here to seize all such Crown & Proprietary officers and other persons as are suspected to be disaffected or dangerous to the public cause; but should not be mentioned as it may be now laid aside as unnecessary.

  Sir, Philadelphia 2d. Augt. 1777.  Despairing of an opportunity of personally communicating a piece of business, in your present perplexing situation, I beg leave to take this method of doing it.  The exposed state of Georgia calls aloud for a pretty formidable force to defend it; for this reason congress have not forbid Col White recruiting deserters from the British Army. I have been informed that there are a considerable number now in the grand army; and [these?] I conceive might be more safely and better employed at a distance from the army from which they deserted. I would then submit it, whether it would not be eligible to turn them over to White, he refunding to the officer the bounty?(1)  It is not necessary to adduce reasons to a Gentleman of your discernment, to prove what ought to be done; but I would only observe, that I have no view in making the proposition but the public service.  It may be objected, that, if deserters are refractory, or willing to return, in the face of the grand Army, they would more probably be worse in a distant weak state. Against which I would say, that Discipline is much severer there-they might be incorporated into other regiments, & kept in Garrisons and upon the Indian line to awe the Savages.  I have the happiness to be your Excellency's most Obedient Servant , Geo Walton.  N.B. I have desired Colonel White to wait upon & deliver this to you, of whom you may satisfy yourself as to any particulars.  ""

  Gentlemen, (Circular) Philada. Augt. 3d. 1777. While the American War continues, & our cruel Enemies manifes a Disposition to persevere in their Views of reducing us by Force of Arms to submit to their Dominion & Government, it becomes the United States to pursue every Step in their Power to oppose them. The American Army, from the Events of War, and other Losses unavoidable in Camps, must necessarily suffer a considerable Diminution. To supply this continual Waste, as well as to encrease our Army, and to fill up the Regiments which were to be raised by the respective States, must certainly be an object of the utmost Importance. The Congress therefore in Hopes of accomplishing their Views in this particular, and rendering the Army of the United States sufficiently strong to vanquish our Enemies, have come to the enclosed Resolves, which are extremely well calculated to answer those Purposes, and if adopted by the States, cannot, I flatter myself, fail of Success.

  My dearest Friend Philadelphia August 4. 1777 Your kind Favour of July 23, came by the Post, this Morning. It revives me, to hear of your Health, and Welfare, altho I shall be, and am disappointed of a Blessing, which I hoped to enjoy. But this is the Result of Wisdom superiour to ours and must be submitted to with chearfull Resignation.  The Loss of Ti. has occasioned as loud Complaints and as keen Resentment in Philadelphia as in Boston. And Congress have determined that an Inquiry shall be made, and have ordered the Major Generals Schuyler and St. Clair, to Head Quarters and ordered M.G. Gates to relieve M.G. Schuyler.(1) Lincoln and Arnold are there. These three I believe will restore our Affairs in that Department.  We have Letters from France, Spain and the West Indies, which shew that our Ground in Europe is firm, and that a War is brewing.  We have all the English Papers, till the latter End of May, which shew that Britain is in a wretched Condition indeed-their East India Affairs in Distraction, their Affrican Trade ruined and their West Indian Concerns in the Utmost Distress. Almost all their West India Planters have left the Kingdom in Despair.  Their Scavengers of the Streets of Germany have been able to rake together, but a little Filth.  Where How is going No Astroleger can determine. He has left the Capes of Delaware and where he is gone no one can tell. We expect to hear from him at the North River, or at Rhode Island, but cant tell when.  I, for my Part am very homesick, but I will not leave the Field untill the Campaign is ended-unless I should fall sick. This horrid Hot Weather melts my Marrow within my Bones, and makes me faint away almost. I have no other Way to keep alive, but by Abstinence from Eating and drinking. I should not live a Month if I did not starve myself. When I come home I shall be an Epicure.

  My dear sir Philade Augt 5 1777 I have had the Pleasure of receiving several Letters from you and I thank you for the Intelligence therein communicated to me. I beg you to continue your favors although it may not be in my Power to balance the Account.  Our Affairs are now in a very critical Situation. There is strong Reason however to promise ourselves a favorable Issue. Men of Virtue throughout Europe heartily wish well to our Cause. They look upon it, as indeed it is, the Cause of Mankind. Liberty seems to be driven from every other Part of the Globe. The Prospect of our affording for its Friends an Asylum in this new World, gives them universal Joy. France & Spain are in reality, though not yet openly, yeilding us Aid. Nevertheless, it is my opinion that it would be more for the future Safety, as well as the Honor of the united States of America, if they could establish their Liberty and Independence, with as little foreign Aid as possible. If we can Struggle thro' our Difficulties alone and establish ourselves, we shall value our Liberties, so dearly bought, the more, and be less obligd, and consequently the more independent on others. Much depends on the Efforts of this Year. Let us therefore lay aside the Consideration of every Subject which may tend to a Disunion. The Reasons of the late Conduct of our General Officers at Tyconderoga must endure a strict Scrutiny. Congress have orderd an Inquiry, and for this Purpose Genl. Schuyler & St. Clair are orderd to Head Quarters. Gates immediately takes the Command of the Northern Army. He gains the Esteem of the soldiers, and his Success in restoring the Army AUGUST 5, 1777  there the last year, from a State of Confusion & Sickness to Health & good order affords a flattering Prospect. In my opinion he is an honest and able officer. Bad as our Affairs in that Quarter appear to be, they are not ruinous. Reinforcements of regular Troops are already gone, & I hope the brave N. England Militia will joyn in sufficient Numbers to damp the Spirits of Burgoyne. One grand Effort now may put an End to the Conflict. I am, Yr affectionate Friend, Samuel Adams  ""

  Dr Sir Philadelphia August 5th 1777 Yesterday your favor of 15th ulto came to Hand inclosing a Letter for Captain Caswell which shall be Immediately forwarded to him, and you may be assured that every possible attention will be paid to him by me, and with the greatest pleasure.(1) I have written to you on every Subject which you Suggest in your Letter, by many Opportunities, and am much Concerned to find they had not reached your Hands before the Date of your last. I hope however you have received them long before this, and you will perceive by them that I have paid the most early and dilligent attention to your Commands. The Business relative to Collo. Shepherds Battalion, and the Artilary Company underwent no delay except what was absolutely Necessary for the several references and reports Incident to the War Department. The result on Both was, the Battalion was taken into Continental pay as one of the 16 (the Stipulations of the Assembly being observed), the Company also taken into pay (but not annexed to any Battallion), and both are ordered to Join the Grand army without delay. The resolutions relative to these were transmitted to you both by the Board of War and by me, and Inclosed duplicates of that relative to the Battalion.(2)  I am much Concerned that the money has met with such unexpected delay, but I assure you that so soon as I heared of the Determination of the Assembly I took the only step then in my Power to expedite the Transmission of it, which was to give Notice to the Treasury that I daily expected to demand of them the Ballance of the 500,000 Dollars, but the Constant and pressing Demands render this precaution Ineffectual, because the Military Service would admit of no delay, and the Treasury were obliged to pay out what was reserved for our State, and not having the Resolve of the Assembly, I could not Interfere to prevent it. When Mr Penn arrived the Treasury here was exhausted, and we were obliged to apply for an Order on the Treasurer at Baltimore. This Occasioned very great delay and Difficulty. The ordinary mode of Transmission by the Board of War could not take place, and  AUGUST 5, 1777  we were obliged to apply to General Nash for an Officer to take Charge of the money when delivered by the Treasurer. The officer received from us his Instructions on the 11th July and we have Since heared nothing more of him but presume he has before this arrived in your State with three hundred thousand Dollars and some proclamation which Mr Penn charged him with.(3) From Mr Penn's having with him the resolve, and from some other Circumstances, I concluded he was chiefly Expected to transact this Business. This however did not prevent me from giving the most dilligent attention to it, and I can assure you that no unnecessary delay happened after his arrival here, for altho he undertook to do that part of the Business which respected the Treasury, and I what respected the Board of War, yet I gave the strictest attention to Both, nor did I perceive him in the least remiss. In short Sir if you knew how heavily money Business proceeds here you would not wonder at the delay.  As the Post is Just going out I have not time to add any thing more to this letter, except that we have been for some days under Expectation of an Invasion of this State. The Enemys Fleet Sailed from New York, as you will see by my last and they soon appeared off the Capes of Delaware. After hovering there several days they steered away but it is not agreed what Course. General Washington is here and great part the army Encamped in the Neighborhood. The Movements of the Enemy have disappointed both whigs and Tories. The latter wished for them in order to their Subduing us, and the whigs wish for them in full Confidence that we should give them a very warm reception, and an Effectual Check. It is now pretty generally thought that they have no design on this City, and that their principle object is to Establish a Communication by way of Hudsons River, between the Sea and the Northern Leaks.  A Gloom still hangs over our affairs in the Northern Department, and we are using our best Endeavours to remove it. Nothing Interesting has transpired thence since my last.  You shall have the earliest Intelligence of every thing that is worth your attention.  I have the honor to be, your Excellency's very obedt Servt.  Thos Burke ""

  Dr Sir, Philada. 5th August 1777 I wrote to you the 25th Ulto by Capt Budd of the Georgia Troops. Every day since my Arrival in this place has produced something new from the Theatre of War, you will find the principal occurrences in the News Papers which I shall send you.  The Loss of Ticonderoga has raised universal Complaint, an inquiry has been demanded by the Voice of the People and is now orderd by their Representatives. To say all that I think upon that Subject founded upon his own Letters might bear too hard upon the Commanding Officer, but 'tis easy to perceive great Propriety in the advice of the General Officers for evacuating the Fortress at the time their Opinions were ask'd, and a criminal Deficiency on the Commanders Part in not calling for them while there was opportunity for saving the Cannon, stores and some Lives. Be that as it may, Genl. Fermoy disclaims the merit of abandoning the whole to have been consistent with his Sentiments before a proper Resistance had been made .(1) General Schuyler is not a little blamed for absence from his Post, nor on the other hand does he want Advocates who hesitate not to cast part of the Fault upon Congress. These are the Ebullitions of Party. A Court of Inquiry will develop Truth and give the Public better Information. In the mean time Genl. Gates by the unanimous Vote of Congress is orderd to take Command of the Northern Department, tis said he is an excellent officer and exceedingly popular in N. England, whence we hope to derive such Aid from the Militia as will at least check Mr Bourgoynes Progress. I am sorry to say he seems at present to be bearing down all before him.  The late Motions of Lord and Genl Howe have puzzled every body on our Side of the Question. After we had learn'd of Bourgoynes Successes I uniformly maintain'd that the Fleets appearance even off the Capes of Delaware was no more than a Feint calculated to draw Genl Washington into fatiguing Marches and remarches through Jersey. It seems the General was so strongly persuaded of that Fact he would not cross Delaware until he had received Orders from Congress in consequence of an erroneous Information that 60 of the Fleet had certainly anchor'd within the Bay, and the Remainder were pouring in with a fair Wind. So strongly had this false Intelligence been impress'd  AUGUST 5, 1777  upon our minds that orders were dispatch'd for driving off Cattle, removing Waggons, Horses &ca &ca from the borders of the Bay and River.(2) Five Ships were equipp'd and the best inform'd had mark'd the very day for landing the Enemys Troops. All parties were disappointed-the cursed Tories who abound in and about this City, because they had expected their Friends-the Friends of freedom, because they had wished to give a decisive Blow to those British Buccaniers. These finally disappear'd about four days ago, and whither they are now wandering we know not, probably they may have reenter'd North River, possibly landed at Rhode Island and part of the Fleet may be gone to bombard Boston which we know to be one Line in the general Plan. Our Troops are encamp'd within a few Miles of this City, by the time they have recover'd from the fatigue of the late severe Marches we shall learn more certainly the Destiny of the Strollers. Part of them must have shar'd fatigues with our People. Their Horses & many of their Men had been a full Month on Shipboard, when we Last heard from them. Mischief they may do tis all they can hope to do. Conquest they cannot expect, even if they should work our Destruction, in that Case they will only have enabled their Rival Neighbours to reap the Harvest of their own Ruin. To console us in some measure we are told and it is believed that our Eastern Friends have in a second Attempt actually taken Fort Cumberland in St Johns.(3) To morrows Paper which I shall have time to inclose with this will shew you the fate of brave Manly, whose fall I think more glorious than all his Feats.(4) He was announced at N. York as a Pirate but it will behove his Keepers to treat him like a Gentleman if they have any regard for the late Commander of the Fox. We have heard nothing late from General Lee. The Capture of Major Genl Prescott will be another Bar against further ill Usage to him and when the heat of present Enterprizes has a little subsided an Exchange will probably be effected.(5)  The repeated Instances of British cruelty exercised upon American Prisoners particularly those produced in Doctor Franklins letter to Lord Stormont and others this very day by a Master of a Vessel escaped from N York have raised a Spirit which will soon appear with the Label of Retaliation. When the Question is brought I will oppose it in part. I abhor the practice of Cruelty and will never in our circumstances consent to make Returns except in cases where good effects may be expected. Circumstanced as we are a general and rigid Retaliation wd be impolitic. The common people of England are our Friends. I believe their infamous Leaders have strove to extort Cruelty to prisoners on our part in order to enrage and unite them against us. Nothing less will make them our Enemies. To imprison closely and if occasion require to hang a Prescot and a Barrington for Injuries done to Lee will not displease but rather be applauded by those common people. Such  Strokes I have no Objection to. With the lower Class of Soldiers and Seamen I would contrast American Humanity against British Ferocity, but if a Douglas or a Jordan could be handled some Atonement should be made for the Blood of Burke and others who have sufferd under their Barbarian Hands.  It does not appear that Genl Howe has received any considerable Reinforcement the present Year, perhaps a few hundred, at most 2000 chiefly Anspachers. These we are well inform'd refused to march and by a Letter from a Friend at Rotterdam (6) we are assured that most of them were sent down the Maes tied Neck and Heels. The foreign Troops on the Spot are much disgusted and among Bourgoynes a Mutiny lately happend in which eighty Lives were lost.  We are assured from good Authority that this City is the grand Object of the Campaign. It might have been so while Reinforcements were expected, but the late Movements of the Brothers mark the Imbecillity of the Generals Army which we think cannot exceed 8000 & General Washington seems to be certain that Bourgoyne has not above 6000. To them some recruits may have been added from among the mal Contents on his late rapid inroad. You will see in the News papers we have taken the Liberty to hang two of General Howes recruiting Officers on North River. If those Generals can form a junction, no doubt an attempt will be made to penetrate the Country & we may hear of them in front & Rear before October. On the other hand Spirited measures under General Gates who will go out this day (the 6th) to Command the Northern Department will keep them asunder & may prove the ruin of their Campaign.  General Putnam commands at Peeks Kill. He will have his hands full & if not Speedily & well supported we shall lose our frigates on North River, the Country will be laid open & Thousands of Tories & property Men join the Enemy. Exposed to Similar dangers I find we are at Providence, where we have also two Frigates & much other Valuable Shipping. These the Enemy are at this time attempting to destroy to complete the Conquest of Rhode Island Government & open an easy passage to Boston. Not one of these projects could be executed if the people were anxious to defeat them, but there seems to be an universal langour, except in the article of Money. Zeal & animation to make as much of that as possible & by all possible ways & means are very visible among all Classes. While this Spirit Governs nothing more can be expected than base defensive action, but tis clear if we were united & would act with vigour only three Months no British Troops would remain on this side the Lakes but such as were protected by Men of War or confined by prison Walls. The New Yorkers & some others blame New England, the Yankees retort & upon a fair hearing it appears that the latter have given more Men in proportion than any   other State. But Say the Southern States they are able to do more, they are attentive only to privateering & making Money. New England replies we furnish our quota ascertained by your Selves, we have a large frontier to defend both by Land & Sea, our Country is barren & affords bare Subsistence in return for hard Labour. Ye enjoy fertile fields, live in Luxury Without the Labour of your own hands, Ye are Rich in Money & Products & can better afford to pay. I believe New England is at this time, unless the British Army is actually gone there, in happier circumstances than any Southern State, but we should remember three things. They bore the first & Severest attack-what they now enjoy they have gained by their address & their industry- their gains have greatly distressed the common Enemy & in so far we participated I may add, they are still the grand object of British revenge.  We have the best assurance that the port of Havanna is open to American Vessels, that the Caribs in the Island of St Vincents have reasserted their rights, obtained Supplies of Arms & ammunition from Martinico, made Several Successful inroads upon the planters, taken many of their Negroes, destroyed vast fields of Cane & Grain, that the Governor at the head of the Militia had marched against them. If I remember right seven British Regiments were fully employed to bring those half armed Savages to a treaty & a drawn game in 1773. Lord North has now cut out work enough to employ Seventy Regiments.(7)  The late flood of French Men rushed in upon us under argeements with Mr. Deane has reduced Congress to a painful dilemma. If we employ with all his unwarranted Contracts, many of our best Generals will be grosly affronted; if we do not, the United States will be exposed to the reproach & probably resentment of Men who have been deceived & ill used. Some of them have been very clamorous & we shall be obliged to make pecuniary Satisfaction for their disappointment of Rank, Some of them by the by prove to be rank Cheats, nevertheless they have Credentials from our agent Deane & must be provided for in Some way. Holzendorf being a long time upon hand, I interposed on his behalf, obtained his Commission of Lt. Colonel according to agreement, but he is not employed.(8) This so far looks well as it Shows these people we are not altogether dependent upon Frenchmen. The Chevalier Faliat [Failly] who in his passage from Charles Town to Virginia had been taken by the Daptine M.W. [H.M.S. Daphne] arrived here a few days ago. The recommendation of Doctor Franklin Seconded by that of Monsieur de Coudrie has ensured him a Majority, a Commission only but no employment at present.(9)  A Commission of Major General is granted to the Marqui de la Fayette the young nobleman who lately came from Charles Town. He required no pension, no Special Command; the honour of fighting  near General Washington & having rank in the Army was all he coveted except opportunities to shew his Zeal for the glorious cause of American Freedom either in the Field, or at Court when it shall be judged he can be more Servicable at Versailles. This illustrious Stranger whose address & manner bespeak his birth will Serve a short Campaign & then probably return to France & Secure to us the powerful Interest of his high & extensive connexions.(10)  General Howe has published by proclamation an extraordinary regulation of Trade in New York, calculated as they pretend to Starve the Rebels. (1l) Except the necessary article of Salt we abound in good things although we pay abundantly for them. Salt is excessively dear, 16 Dollars per bushel. Nevertheless the Enemy's men who are purchased & fed at much dearer rate will be all defunct or banished before our whole Stock of Salt is exhausted. From the Same quarter we learn that the Inhabitants of that City & its environs are very unhappy infinitely more so than their old friends whom they infamously forsook. I have seen & read English News papers up to the 13 May & Letters from France late as June. England is truely distressed on all hands. She has Suffered by Captures made by the Americans & Frenchmen Americanized far beyond my former apprehensions. The number of Privateers Maned by Frenchmen under English Captains & Congress Commissions is astonishing. These have destroyed the English West India & African Trade & are daily making prizes in the Channel from Scilly to the German Sea. To such insults do the British Ministry Tamely Submit-while on the other hand they meanly threaten Holland only for having connived at illicit Trade with us. You have seen Sir Joseph Yorkes memorial presented at the Hague, I will Send you the Dutch Envoy's humble answer & we learn from undoubted authority that a Mr. Vanbibber our Commissioner or Agent was lately imprisoned at St. Eustatia for having caused an English Vessel to be taken in Sight of the Island.(12) Tis however Said this is the effect of policy. I will not take upon me to comment but you may depend upon it we have now a Vessel for War building in Amsterdam which will be equal or is intended to be, to an English 64 Gun Ship & that the States of Holland are as anxiously concerned to establish our Independence as the French are, & that in order to be ready for defense they are augmenting their Navy.  Our Agents in France have contracted with proper persons to dispatch an advice Boat together with 30 Tons of Merchandize if required once a Month to Congress. The first arrived at Portsmouth a few days ago & brought us the accounts which the News papers & This have retailed to you together with Some of a more private nature. The Second Sailed as I suppose the latter end of June or beginning of July & on this Instant learn she was taken within Six hours of her   leaving port-Stratagem which must be guarded against in future time. Mr Lee (Arthur) had been at Madrid where he had been well received as a private Agent for the American States, but the Court would not recognize him in any higher Character. From thence we have obtained Strong assurances of friendship. The ports of Spain in Europe & that of Havanna in America are open to our Ships Warlike & Commercial & every desirable encouragement held out to us. Content with this Since no more was to be gained, Mr Lee turned his face to the Court of Berlin.(13) I long to know his reception & Success there.  I shall send to the President Copy of a Letter from a very intelligent writer at Paris which he will probably give Wells to print,(14) the Gentleman to whom it was addressed assures me we may depend upon his correspondents veracity. Indeed tis no more than consonant with advices which we have received from our Commissioners. You will learn there how much all the States in Europe, Portugal excepted, Interest themselves in our Cause, it is said that even the Empress of Russia wishes our Establishment & we are assured we shall not be troubled with Troops from her dominions. Our greatest Enemies are within ourselves & not among those Men who oppose us by Arms or who honestly & openly profess themselves averse from our measures & politics. You would be astonished were you here to see the number & influence of the property Men. I call them so because almost every Man of them were the most Vigorous in opposing the measures of the British Ministry until they perceived that opposition, proceeding to a serious War, then fear of the Loss of Life & Estate shocked their faith. they wished to remain neuter, they still acknowledged that America had been greatly aggreived but withdrew from the Councils & Society of their former Colleagues under pretences, some that Independence had been declared too soon, others that it had never been their design to be Independent. A few such we have in Carolina, observe them, they are Men of property called sensible & good Sort of Men. They are cunning Men, & their cunning is exceedingly baneful to a cause which in their hearts they wish well. If we lose that Cause it will be the effect of their timidity & their pernicious examples. Whether their wishes to enjoy their Estates in quiet will succeed I know not-I rather beleive they will drag a few years of life through painful reproaches & reflections- but I say, Such Men in this State & that of New York abound-& unless the progress of Burgoyne & his junction with Sir William Howe is Speedily prevented they will have room to expand to join the Enemy & to reduce the friends of Freedom to the utmost hazards & difficulties.  The amazing scarcity & high prices of articles formerly imported from Europe & the West Indies have influenced the rates of every necessary of Life. Fire Wood delivered at a House not 1/4 Miles from  the Wharf at 220 Carolina Currency per Chord, Butter at this Season the best a Dollar a pound, Beef 6/3, Mutton & other small Meat 7/6, Rum £12, Wine £13, Brown Sugar 25/, Horses at Stable a Dollar & upwards per day-for a Living Room, a Bed Chamber & the use of a Kitchen, where I find my own Fire & my own food of every kind, my Cook also, I pay 14 2/3ds Dollars per Week, & so in proportion for every thing else. These extraordinary circumstances hurt a few people, I am one among the hurt, but they by no means threaten immediate ruin to America, yet from them these property Men denounce our destruction & are very industrious to impress the minds of weak people with the most direful apprehensions. Some Steps have been taken by the Executive power to remove such Men from the Capital, weak & feeble attempts & hitherto without any good effect. We are not yet Sufficiently distressed to make us Sufficiently in earnest. An old friend of mine now a rigid Tory, complained to me of the friends of Liberty who had on the 4 July broke the Glass Windows of such quiet people as had refused to illuminate their Houses upon that anniversary. In reply I expressed my concern for the ill timed destruction of Glass and added for his consolation, that he might depend upon this as a type of broken bones to that Glass unless they soon reformed or removed out of the Country. I have dwelt too long perhaps upon a Subject which you are well acquainted with, but although you are well acquainted with the Subject in general, you had no Idea when I left Charles Town of the number & influence of the Tories in these parts.  7th August. Your obliging Letters of 4th & 5th July by Colo C C Pinckney just came to hand & I thank you for all the trouble you have taken for me. More particular replies may appear in the sequel of this or in a future Letter.(15)  ""

  Sir Philadelphia Augt 5t. 1777 The foregoeing is a Copy of Mr Mifflins Petition.(1) When I arrived here Mr Mifflin was not in Town for sometime, when he came I gave him your Letter. He sayd he was immediately going out again & should return in about a fortnight when he would confer with me further upon the Matter but have not seen him since. I beleive they have not got the papers from admiralty Court relative thereto. However Sir as soon as I can get them to attend on it you shall hear further from me on the Subject. In the mean time youll see how far the Petition states the Facts aright & let me hear from you thereon.  I have taken up one hundred pounds L[awful] m[one]y of Mr Whartons & given a Draught on you therefore shall send you a Draught for sd Sum on the Treasury or pay Table.  As to News youll see all there is in the public Papers. We have for sometime been expecting an Attack upon this City, but the Fleet has now left our Capes & tis probable are gone with a Design to penetrate the North River. Genll How by this Manouvre has drawn Gen. Washingtons army this way, which leis en[camp]ed about 7 mile from hence. The great Advantage our Enemies have by their water Movements, put it in their power to harrass our Army by sudden & long Marches. We were in hopes that How would have pursued his attempt up this River as it is imagined we might have received them here to as great Advantage as any Where Else. Our Accounts from France look favourable and have reason to think a war in Europe cant be far Distant. We have many Frenchmen over, applying for Commissions &c bringing most exorbitant Contracts, which Congress have been obliged to disanull However some have been taken into our Service, where our Interest & Policy made it necessary.  AUGUST 5, 1777  Scyler & St Clair are ordered down to head Quarters in order that an Enquiery be made into the Conduct of the northern Department.

  My Dear Sir [August 5, 1777] Matters remain here much as when I wrote you last, except some alarms caused by a report that a very large fleet appeared off Cape Ann on the 31st Ulto. The time agreed very well with the accots we previously had of the fleets sailing from N.Y. As we supposed The Town was the Enemies object, all hands were preparing to go thither when on a sudden the Fleet vanished in a fogg & we have heard nothing of it since, but its still a matter of great speculation where this invincible Armada is Bound. It is reported as Gen'l Washingtons opinion that Virginia is the object but those who have not the most favorable opinion of that Climate think they know better than to go there, that this is only a finesse and that they will return immediately & push up Hudsons River. Others will have it that they are certainly coming this way. The last opinion I endeavor to support, not because I realize it, but because I wo'd have everybody in readiness if that sho'd be the case. The enemies ships are so thick on the coast that it is almost impossible to escape them, one of them chased a ship on shore a few days ago within 6 or 7 miles of this. She proved to be a West India man which had been taken by a Connecticut Privateer but unfortunately for the captors the tide was rising & the enemy soon took her off with them. It was reported yesterday that we had gained great advantages in a Battle on Wood Creek & that the Enemy had left Skeenborough & Castletown but we have no acco'ts from that way that can be depended on. I wish I co'd Know from the fountain of intelligence how matters stand with the Northern Army and to what the late extraordinary disaster is owing. Here the general Cry is treachery and some go so far as to name the sum given, however these re- AUGUST 5, 1777  flections are always to be expected on such occasions. If you meet with any plans of that country I wish you wo'd send me sketches that I may form some Idea of their movements. Can nothing be done with the officers that are loitering about.  I am told Boston is full of them, I suppose they pretend on the Recruiting service but if that is their business it must be for the next war for by the means they seem to use the recruits they raise cannot be fit for service under 17 or 18 years.

  Honored Sir, Philadelphia Augt. 5th. 1777 The large Fleet which sailed from New-York, and hath since been seen off and on the Capes of Deleware, have not been seen or heard of since last Thursday at sunset. A few there are, who still beleive they are yet intending an Attack upon this City-some there are, who suppose them gone still more South-ward, to Maryland, Virginia or So. Carolina -but the most general Opinion is, that they have either returned to New-York to push up the North River, or have gone to Rhode-Island. By this Faint, they have drawn Our Army at too great a Distance to give immediate assistance to the Eastern States; besides that Our Men must be greatly fatigued by such long Marches. Our Army is however in great Spirits & good Health. They are indeed much disappointed in not meeting with Mr. How, but will not murmur at making a much longer March than their last; If They can but releive their Brothers, and cut off our Amphibious Enemies from their Sea Retreat. I hope the New England States have been in such Suspicions of the Intentions of Mr. How, as to have put them upon every necessary Measure of Opposition. This I expect will be a trying Day to New-England. Her own future Happiness or Misery, and Her Fame amongst the Nations of the World, depend upon Her Firmness, Fortitude and Patriotism at this critical Moment. Threatned and invaded on all Sides, may She rise with Strength and Dignity, striking Terror and dismay upon the Hearts of Her Enemies, exciting Envy even from Her Friends, and securing thereby Glory & Honor to Herself & Peace and Happiness to Millions yet unborn.  Ticonderoga ! I know what the Public must expect ! I hope their Ardour has not been damped. I hope the Conduct of Congress will give Spirit & Vigour to Our Arms in the Northern Department. Genls. Sc-r and Sin r are ordered to Head-Quarters, Genl. Gates is ordered immediately to repair to the Northern Departmt. A Thorough AUGUST 5, 1777  Examination must and will be made. Meanwhile Our noble Exertions may restore Our Honor & secure Our Country.  The Treasury have not yet procured the Loan Office Certificates from Maryland; They expect them in a Day or two, when they will be immediately forwarded. I have heard nothing yet of the Arrival of your Vessell at Maryland for Flower &c.  Some few Days past upon an Application of One of the Southern States for Money, it was moved that a Carriage and a Guard might be procured at the Expence of the States.(1) And it appeared it had been granted several Times, this was somewhat surprising, as the New England States have ever risked their own Money & been at the sole Expence of conveying it. It was said those Charges would be allowed, I therefore advise you of it, that the proper Charges may be brought forward in your next Account.  Before I left the State a Committee was appointed to correspond with your Delegates, but I have never had a Line from that Committee. Perhaps Sir, there is not a State in the Union, that has so little Correspondance with its Delegates, upon Measures which respect the States in general, and their own State in particular.  Our Advices yesterday recd. from France are equal to Our most sanguine Expectations. An immediate Publication of them might frustrate Our Own Wishes, as well as the Efforts of Our Friends to serve us. By a Letter yesterday recd. from Martinico, we are justly lead soon to expect a War between France & England. Our Advices also from France strengthen those Expectations. It is agreed by all that if we support Ourselves but this year, the Day is, by the Blessing of Heaven, Our Own. And We must all agree that the present Strength of Our Enemies in America, is nothing to Our real Strength, if unanimously and vigorously exerted. With my best Wishes for the Honor, Peace & Happiness of Our Country and the Deliverance of Our State from the Invasions of Our Enemies, and the present threatning Appearances against it, and for Your personal Health & long Continuance in the Affection, Esteem & Honor of your Country I am, Honored Sir, yr. most obdt. & humble Servt. Hy Marchant  P.S. I submit it to the wisdom of the Genl. assembly, whether it is not essentially necessary to empower their Delegates in Congress to Act untill others shall be chosen in their Stead, and take Their Seats in Congress. Their appointment for the year, to the contrary, notwithstanding.(2) Mr. Ellery can more fully explain to you the necessity of this measure.  I enclose you certain Resolves of Congress, least you should not otherwise receive Them timely, as they require the immediate Consideration of the Genl. Assembly.(3)  ""

  Sir Philada Augt. 5th 1777 I this day received your favour of the 15th July but as you take no notice of a letter I wrote you dated June 21st (1) I suppose it miscarried. In order therefore to answer some questions you put to me, Inform you that I was detained about two weeks occasioned by my horses geting hurt, and not being able to purchase others sooner.  I arrived here the l9th and Immediately con[ferred with] Doctor Burke on the most expeditious method of sending away the money agreeable to the direction of our Assembly. We accordingly went to the Treasury Board, the Gentn. promised to furnish us with 300,000 Dollars in a week at farthest. We could have sent off 100,000 which was the largest sum in the office for a long time but as we looked upon that sum as too trifling and were made to believe that we should be supplied from the loan office we waited. At length finding that the money was received in small sums and the Treasury board was so pressed, we obtained an order of Congress on Michl Hiligass esqr. for 300,000 Dollars. He was at Baltimore superintending the press, with direction to send that sum to Newbern as soon as he possibly could under a proper guard. We were obliged to appoint a person to receive the money tho' it went at the risque of the United States and at their expence.  Lieutenant Allen was recommended by Mr. Blunt & Genl. Nash for that purpose. Our Troops were in possession of some No. Carolina dollars wch would not pass here and as every necessary of life was so exceedingly dear I thought it but Justice to exchange with the Soldiers and give them Continental money. I accordingly recd. 2485 1/2 dollars which sum was sent by Mr Allen with a list, made out by Mr. Blunt of the different parcels. This with the other money I hope you have received before this.  I assure you it was not in my power or Mr. Burke's to send off the money sooner. I knew the pressing demand you had for it and the very frequent applications made by us to Congress on that subject, will  AUGUST 5, 1777  excuse us from the charge of inattention or negligence to that buisness. The reason I did not mention any thing relative to the money in my letter of the 25th was owing to my having wrote fully on that subject a few days before.  Inclosed I send you a resolve of Congress relative to the recruiting business & apprehending deserters.  General Howe three weeks ago was supposed to have the greatest part of his Army on board with his horse. Upwards of 220 ships sailed from New York, part of them was seen near Egharbour, this induced Genl. Washington to march 8, or 10,000 men near this City. The Fleet appeared at the mouth of the Delaware for three days and then went off in the night. We have not been informed what course they went.  We have some accounts from France & Spain that are agreeable. Those powers are disposed to supplie us with all sorts of military stores, and to give our paper money a credit.  The Marques de Fiette a young Nobleman of the first Family in France and Nephew to their Embassador now in England, has la[tely?] got here.

The cause of my having made this proposition was that he had lately fought a Duel with Governor Gwinnett, in which the latter had fallen; and I was afraid the friends of the deceased, made sore by the loss of their principal, would again blow up the embers of party & dissention, and disturb the harmony & vigour of the Civil & military authorities.

  Gentlemen, Philada. Aug. 6th. 1777  The Congress having ordered Generals Schuyler & St. Clair to Head Quarters that an Enquiry may be made into their Conduct and the Reasons of the Evacuation of Ticonderoga, they have directed Genl. Gates to take the Command in that Department and to repair thither with the utmost Expedition.  In the present critical State of our Affairs in that Quarter, it is absolutely necessary that some vigorous and decisive Measures should be taken to stop the Progress of the Enemy. These Steps should be taken as early as possible, as the Consequences of Delay may be extremely disagreeable. From the great Advantage our Enemies have over us in the Facility with which their Troops may be transported by Sea to any Part of America, they will always have it in their Power to make a Descent before the Continental Army can possibly arrive to oppose them. The Militia therefore whenever this happens must be depended upon, and their Exertions I trust will never be wanting when called on, either to defend their own Country, or to join with the Army of the United States to oppose the Common Enemy. I am therefore most earnestly to entreat you will order such Part of your Militia to reinforce the Army under Gen. Gates as he may judge sufficient, & that you will exert yourselves to comply with the Enclosed Requisition of Congress (1) without the least Delay.  I have the Honour to be, Gentlemen, your most obed & hble Set. J.H. Presid.  P.S.

It was strenuously opposed by N. York, & supported by N England, & was carried by almost every Vote. The truth is Duane &c had earnestly remonstrated agst Him to the Genl & told him it wod greatly disgust their Convention &c (The fact is Schuyler hates him) & N.

If I had Inclination or Leisure to write a Letter of Complement, I am sure you would not be pleasd with it. The Times are very serious; our Affairs are in a critical Situation. The Enemy, after long promising a Visit to this City, made an Appearance last Week near the Capes of Delaware. But they have not been seen these six days past. The Hounds are in fault and have lost Scent of them. We shall hear where they are gone, I dare say, before long. It belongs to the military Gentlemen to penetrate their Design. I think they could not have come here in a better time, because we were well prepared for them. General Washington had drawn his Forces into the Neighborhood of this Place and I verily believe the people here, divided and distracted as they are about their internal Government, would have joynd in sufficient Numbers to have given a good Account of them.  The shameful Defeat of our Forces at Ticonderoga is not more distressing to us than it is vexatious. A thorough Scrutiny into the Causes of it must and will be made. For this Purpose Schuyler and St Clair are ordered to Head Quarters. I confess I cannot at present account for it even upon the Principle of Cowardice. There seems to me to be the evident Marks of Design. Bad as our Affairs are in that Quarter they are not desperate. Gates is gone to take the Command. He is an honest and able officer; always belovd by his Soldiers because he always shares with them in Fatigue and Danger. This has not been said of his immediate Predecessor. I hope the N. England States will once more make a generous Exertion, and if they do I am deceivd if Burgoyns Prosperity does not soon prove his Ruin.  Our Intelligence from Europe is very flattering to us. The virtuous and sensible there universally wish well to our Cause. They say we are fighting for the Liberty and Happiness of Mankind. We are at least, contending for the Liberty & Happiness of our own Country and Posterity. It is a glorious Contest. We shall succeed if we are virtuous. I am infinitely more apprehensive of the Contagion of Vice than the Power of all other Enemies. It is the Disgrace of human Nature that in most Countries the People are so debauchd, as to be utterly unable to defend or enjoy their Liberty.  Pay my respects to Colo Whipple.

  No. 7 In Committee for Foreign Affairs Gentlemen Philadelphia Augt 7. 1777  Inclosed are duplicates of Commissions and Instructions for Willm. Lee and Ralf Izard Esqrs. and Triplicates of Letters No 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.  Since our last No.6 (1) a variety of Circumstances in the Military department have happened, many of which are so intricate and unfinished as not to enable us to draw any just Conclusion therefrom.  Immediately after the unsuccessful attempt made by Genl Howe to cut off a division of our Army under Lord Sterling as mentioned in No. 6 The whole Body of the Enemy retreated to Staten Island, embarked on board their fleet and on the 23 of July put to Sea. On the 27th they were off the Capes of Deleware. Genl Washington with the Army arrived at German Town the 29th. The 31st the Enemy's fleet stood out again to Sea. They made a Second appearance at the Capes, but did not attempt to come in, since which we have heard no Account of them. As this Packet goes from the Eastward you will probably be furnished with something from that Quarter before she sails.  Our Worst News is, we have lost Ticonderoga; whether by Neglect or necessity, Cowardice or good Conduct will appear afterwards. Congress have ordered Genl Gates to that Department and have directed that Genls Schuyler and St Clair appear at Head Qrs. that enquiry be made into their Conduct of this Mysterious Affair. In the Philadelphia News Papers of July 16th & 23 and Augst 5th & 6th you will see Genls. Schuyler's & St. Clair's Letters, and the resolves of Congress.  We have been fortunate enough to take and unfortunate enough to lose again the Fox Frigate, she was made a Prize of by Capts Manly and McNeal but a 40 and 64 being in Sight when she struck she was afterwards retaken by them.  Major Genl Prescot who Commanded the Enemy's forces at Rhode Island was seized and made Prisoner of by a Small Party under Lt Col Barton, see Genl Washington's Letter to Congress in a Philadelphia News Paper July 23d. Congress have presented the Col with a Sword, and Likewise Lt Col Meigs with another who performed a Gallant exploit on L Island bringing off near an hundred Prisoners and destroying a Large Quantity of forage.  Were it not for the Ticonderoga Affair we should have nothing but good News to write, and even that may in the End be as lucky a Circumstance to the general Cause as their attempting to march thro' the Jersies last Winter. We have a fine healthy Army anxious for nothing so much as to meet the Enemy. Surely! it must appear a ridiculous  AUGUST 7, 1777  thing in Europe that Genl Howe should be thus shunning the Army he came to conquer, and wasting his time on running up and down the Coast with his whole fleet at this hot season of the year, when the ministry in England and perhaps Ld Stormont at Paris have given out that he has penetrated an hundred Miles or more up the Country.  We are with the greatest Respect, Gentlemen, yr. most Obt humble Servants, Benja Harrison  Robt Morris James Lovell P.S. Please to forward the Letters directed to Arthur Lee Esqr and M.

  Dear Sir August 7th 1777 By the delay of Mr Bass here without any good purpose being answered, you will find things go much after the old sort. Indeed, I do not think if he had been earlier dismissed, any thing could be sent by the packet boat which brought the dispatches from France for she must have sailed before he got here.  I still think General W's march to this City will give Howe and Burgoyne full swing in New England and New York. There seems to be no more moving here than if there was no other spot in America where it could be expected the British army could be tempted to land.  I ought to own to you that General Gates is quite of opinion that the enemy will make themselves Masters of Chesapeake and Delaware Bays for it-then will come up this river to attack the Cheveaux making Wilmington head quarters. I do not know whether I tell his story right for I did not believe what he said enough to fix it in my memory. My greatest anxiety is, to have him gone to stop Burgoyne's army which we hear is at Saratoga.  Mr Du Coudray has put in a memorial and petition wherein he requests that I may be dismissed from any Committee relative to his affairs and that no attention may be paid to any thing I may have said relative to his treaty with Mr Deane. Even his most enamored advocates did not think proper to support his petition. It was dismissed.(1) AUGUST 7, 1777  I hope Gates name will produce a willi1lgness to turn out in the Militia of New England. He will have some excellent French officers with him who may induce the Canadians to keep back at least with the Indians if not desert over to us.  We promised great spirit for our countrymen, if they could only have a brave Commander instead of one whom they thought the contrary and some of them even thought to have been traitorous.  General Fermoy writes like one crazy with chagrin. Though he voted for evacuating the posts, yet he meant to have sold them very dear. He says there never was so ill conducted a retreat made by man before. You see by Jay's publication that St Clair excuses Schuyler altogether.  I need not Scrawl any more as Mr Bass can tell you all the chathistory of this city and I have no secret informations beyond what I have before mentioned.  Your affectionate friend, J.L.  ""

  Dear David, Philadelphia, August 7, 1777. I received your last and Mr. Smith's two weeks ago at least, and I am sorry that I have not been, nor am at present, able to write you fully. You will have heard with pleasure that the enemy did not get so far as Princeton on their last excursion, which was very happy for us. They have lately appeared at Delaware Capes, but they are now gone from thence, and have not been seen since Thursday last.  I am glad to see that you are thinking of determining your profession for life. I have not time to write upon this subject, but shall do it fully in a few days. You know what my desire and ambition is upon that subject; but I am of all things most concerned that you should fear God.

  Philadelphia August 8. 1777 I have concluded to run the Risque of sending Turner Home It will save me the Expence of his Board and Horse.  The Moment he arrives, I hope you will send his Horse to Boston to be sold at Vendue. If he rides the Horse let him be sold immediately If he rides the Mare, you may keep her if you chuse to do so and sell the old Horse, provided the Mare will go in a Carriage which must be tried, because I dont know that she ever was in one.  We have heard nothing from the Enemys Fleet, since they left the Capes of Delaware. They may intend for Philadelphia yet, which makes me a little irresolute about sending away my Man and Horse without which I should be puzzled to get away from this Place, if it should be invaded. I believe I shall delay his Journey for a few days. Perhaps We shall hear more within that Time.  This day compleats Seven Months, since I left all that I delight in When shall I return? Not untill the Year is out, provided I can keep myself tolerably well.  Our Accounts from the Northward are still gloomy. Gates is gone, and I hope will restore some degree of Spirits and Confidence there Burgoigne is laying himself open to destruction, in that Quarter every day. It is strange that no Check is given him.  These vile Panicks, that seize People and Soldiers too, are very difficult to get over. But at last they turn to Vigour, Fury and Desperation, as they did in the Jerseys. I suppose a few Tories in New York, in the Grants and in Berkshire and Hampshire will join Burgoigne, but they will soon repent their rash Folly, and be sick of their Masters. For indeed they will find that neither Burgoigne nor Howe, nor their Master are kind Masters.  The longer We live, the more clearly We see, that nothing will serve our Purpose, but discipline and Experience. Discipline-Discipline, is wanting and must be introduced. The Affair of Ti. will introduce it The Public calls for Justice, and will have it. This Demand does Honour to the People and is a sure Omen of future Success and Prosperity. ""

We shall inform our Friends at Paris of our Opinion on this Head, and shall leave it to them to point out the Ways in which your Zeal for Liberty may be most useful to them & us with the least Degree of Trouble to yourself and Injury to your domestick Interests.

Our Affairs are not in so good a State as we know you earnestly wish them to be; nor are they so injured as the great Preparations of  AUGUST 8, 1777  England may have led you & other Friends at a Distance to fear they would be at this Period of the 3d Campaign.  Genl. Burgoynes Advances over the Lakes are Disadvantages which will be greatly magnified by him: And General Howe will most probably gain some Ground, at first, wherever he is gone.

Philadelphia Aug 8. 1777 We have to acknowledge yours of the 18th of March from Victoria in Spain, and another of May 13th from Paris.(1) The first falls particularly under the Notice of the Committee of Commerce to whom it has been refered AUGUST 8, 1777  You could not at the time of writing, have been certified of the arrival of some interesting despatches from Congress to your Colleagues in France on the 10th of that Month, which might have occassioned a very considerable alteration in the Politics of the Court of Versailles, which would consequently influence those of the Court of Madrid.  The intellegence contained in your last is a most pleasing confirmation of the hopes which you had given us, of pecuniary aid from Spain. Whatever tends to establish the value of our paper currency is most highly important to us. Congress will immediately go into a Consideration of the several hints for this purpose given by you and Messrs Franklin & Deane. The unpleasing events in the Nothern Department has so far engaged the attention of all public bodies, that it has been impossible for Congress to write upon the Subjects mentioned to them by you early enough for us to forward their determinations by the present opportunity.(2)  By our several Letters dispatched in the armed Sloop Independence, from hence, or by Duplicates and Gazettes sent by Mr McCreary from Baltimore, you will know by way of Paris, the history of our Military affairs in a regular detail. We are at this time altogether uncertain as to Mr Howes destination, his Fleet not having been seen since the first of this month.

  [August 9, 1777] 9th. Yesterday was Spent at a review of that part of our Army AUGUST 9, 1777  immediately under General Washington. It seems the General had directed this general Muster of Horse & foot in order to get Men & Officers together & immediately Marched them off the Ground towards Trent Town where they will be halted until we learn somewhat certain of the late Coasting Admiral & General having heard nothing of them Since they left the Capes of Delaware & taken as proof of their having gone beyond North River.  This Morning Mr. John Laurens who made one in the Cavalcade yesterday joined General Washington at head Quarters near German Town as one of his family. My heart was too full at parting & would not allow me to enquire into particulars. To tell you truly my Sense of this matter-although I believe the Young Man will acquit himself well any where, yet I am persuaded he has made an indiscreet choice for his outset in life. His Talents & his diligence would have enabled him to have been much more extensively & essentially useful to his Country in a different line at the same time to have been the Cement of mine & the builder of a new family. As a Soldier One Man can act only as one (very few Cases excepted) & in point of real usefulness will often be excelled by Men of moderate abilities & better Nerves. From this persuasion you will know that I am not perfectly happy under this event, but tis Man's part to bear disappointment with patience.  I have intimated above the high prices of articles in this Market. Let me add, that in consequence of your order I enquired this Morning the price of a Copper Still of 40 Gallons & was informed two hundred Dollars, this enormous 5 fold demand together with the impossibility of getting one to you for the use of your present Crop of Peaches induces me to Suspend a purchase until I hear from you again. Observe, while the Men of War lie in our Bay we can have no Water Carriage, such Vessels as now & then drop into Charles Town with Letters from Philadelphia go from the Sea Coast of Jersey & I believe the land Trade by Waggons is pretty well over.  Some of our Smaller Men of War are now upon an attempt to clear one of the Channels from Delaware to Sea by means of Fire Wrafts- tis said two Frigates lie in Cape May Channel, those are the objects of the present enterprize. We have no Sanguine hopes of a Success.  We have just received dispatches from General Schuyler informing that Mr. Burgoyne was within 25 miles of Albany, & giving Some hopes of cutting off his retreat if the New England forces are alert in coming to his aid.(1) Burgoyne has a numerous train of Indians with him, the Militia it Seems are panic Struck by these Savages, 50 of whom as General Schuyler writes lately put 300 of our people to most infamous flight. I wish our friend Williamson & his Ninety Six Regiment were here.   The packet Boat which I said was taken, was one which had Sailed from hence not one of the late Contract. I am afraid the Capt of the Fox Frigate was prisoner to Manly when he was taken, if so, we shall be at a loss for means to ransom that brave man.  General Howe's proclamation for restricting the Trade & Commerce & Gen. Morgan's regulating the police in New York mark out very Strongly that Governor Tryon is only a Cypher. Indeed when the Inhabitants who are called his Majesty's Loyal & faithful Subjects are threatned with Military Execution for breach of orders as they are in Major General Jones's Proclamation I cannot conceive what part's left for Governor Tryon to act. Comfortable Specimen of Military Government.(2) I perceived by the numerous advertisements in the Royal Gazette of New York that there have been vast importations of every Species of Merchandize into that City & when I tell you the Jews of all denominations in this, give 16 paper Dollars for a Guinea & in proportion for other Gold & Silver & Bills upon London, you will agree that Some of those Goods find a Safe passage hither notwithstanding the prohibitions of General & Major General. As Mr. Desaussan had arrived safely at Nantz I shall have Balance in the hands of [. . .] & Co. which I have desired them to remit in Blankets for my Negroes, but my Letter may Still be in Charles Town in Doctor Gordons hands. If so, I beg you to forward it & write by Some future opportunity as I will endeavor to do from hence. Pressing the Subject it may be possible to get a Supply from that quarter before Christmas. The prices you quote at the prize Sale are enormous; nevertheless I will rather Strip my Pocket naked than suffer my Negroes to be so in a Winter's Night. Therefore my good friend if any Blankets are to be had toward October or November buy a few which with the number I left at home may with prudent management of the Overseers serve the ensuing Winter.  I will not trouble you on my Plantation or Town affairs more particularly than I have done. I know you will do as much for me as your own will permit. I am here at an amazing expence in my Country's Service. If I can render it such as will deserve their acceptance I shall chearfully Submit to such Losses of Estate as will unavoidably be the consequence of my absence. Be so good as to tell me how long that is to be according to the Rule of your House of Assembly are we delegated for one or two Years & recollect that by the nomination to Vice Presidentship my Seat in the House was vacated & by my absence from the State I am no longer Vice president. Be assured I do not remark merely on my own account for tis my inmost wish & will be my utmost endeavour when I return, also to retire from public business, but because it is a flaw in the Constitution which had not been foreseen, tho' by the by I think it a greater that one man should represent the people  of Charles Town in Assembly & the State of So. Carolina in General Congress at the Same time according to your present practice except in the event which I have premised.  Possibly to morrow may produce important intelligence from the Eastward. In that case you will [be] troubled with a postscript to a Letter already enormously long, & may prove much ado about nothing as you will probably have heard all its contents before it reaches you. Be that as it may, you will acknowledge I have laboured to say some thing. I will conclude with what I always repeat with pleasure, my best wishes to you, to Mrs. Gervais & the Children.  ""

  Dear General Philadelphia 9th August 1777. About the 22d July I had the honour of delivering Severally your Letters to Congress & to the New England Delegates. The former was instantly committed to the Board of War & their Report followed by a confirmation of your appointment to Colo. Eveleigh & Mr. Purcel, but for your fine polite Commercial story which must have cost you Some labor to learn & given you much pleasure to relate no more notice was taken than of the particular kind of paper upon which the tale was told. I am sure I thought it a very clever thing when I read it at Mepkin & Sealed it up so nicely.(1) What sort of writing in this World goes for nothing. In that class your other Letter touching Rank may possibly be found, & it will if one may judge from our determination two days ago upon an application from an old & valuable Servant M[ajo]r Genl Arnold whose prayer to be restored to his rank was rejected notwithstanding the acquiescence of Officers whose dates are, as they admit, improperly prior to his.(2) But good General draw no hasty conclusions. Another unexpected vote may turn up & be in your favour.(3) When I am a little older in Congress I'll try hard at a reformation in that article of Rank, persevering in the present mode which is arbitrary & often Subject to caprice will not promote the welfare of our Army.  The evacuation of Ticonderoga & concommitant circumstances have excited public clamour & resentment. Burgoynes advance & Schuyler's retreat to the very threshold of Albany fills the minds of some with the most direful apprehensions, others say he will be checked & his retreat cut off. Everybody wonders what is become of your name sake Sir  AUGUST 9, 1777  William who abandoned his Jersey garrison early in July, embarked his Troops, Horse & foot about the middle, paraded with 228 Sail off the Capes of Delaware the latter end & vanished the 1st August. The Second maneuver drew great Washington [. . .] to this City by a fatiguing Countermarch of upwards 120 Miles, his Letters regularly intimated his opinion that the whole was a calculated feint. We shall probably soon hear of Ld. Howe's appearance at Rhode Island or farther eastward, he cannot be so mad as to leave Burgoyne to Struggle with the united force of New York & New England. We have received most shocking accounts of scalping & mangling by Burgoyne's Indians. He carries fire, Sword & terror with him. The Six Nations are heartily disposed to be our friends, or it appears so by a Talk which they lately Sent in & those who know best say they certainly will be, if our people will fight & give them prospect of conquest. Generals Schyler & St Clair are ordered to head quarters. General Gates gone to take the command of the Northern department. 'Tis agreed the New England Men will chearfully follow him, although they had abandoned Schuyler in whom, rumour reported, they had no confidence. General Fermoy one of the subscribing Council of War at Ticonderoga has written a Letter to Congress disclaiming any part of merit arising from the Surrender of the Fortress without an attempt to repel the Enemy or to Save the Stores. I have seen added in a Letter from a Man of Character that one hundred head of fat Cattle were driven & left within the lines the very morning the fort was evacuated. A deep & impartial enquiry will bring out the truth. Till that event I will neither join those who censure nor those who condemn Mr. St. Claire The principal charge against Schuyler in the public mouth is his residence at & attention to his own Estate, which ought to have but which never had been at the head of his Troops in Garrison. A few days before the Surrender General St. Clair expressed as you will read in one of the News papers strong hopes of making such a defence as would, if not destroy the Enemy, at least cripple him & Spoil his Campaign. The question anxiously asked by those who have a right to demand, is, what happened between that date & the Surrender & Shameful flight? Shameful no doubt, when Mr. Schyler himself writes that our people were panic struck. 300 of them had fled from a party of fifty Indians.  If we learn any thing farther of the British Fleet or from Albany you will be troubled with a postscript.  General Washington lay last night at Correls Ferry or Trent Town, he means as I am informed to encamp on the old ground in Morris Town & await events. Possibly in the enemy's absence he may attempt another Christmas Coup.  Intelligence from our Agents in France is much in our favour-but we have got a Thousand difficulties to Struggle against, if we persevere we shall break smooth ground for our Successors.  Adieu, I am &c  L.B (ScHi). Endorsed by Laurens: \""Sent News Papers. '  1 The letter of June 8 from Brig. Gen.

  sir (1) Philadelphia 9th August 1777. I have received your favour of the 6th July by Colo. Cotesworth Pinckney together with the News papers & thank you for the management of my affairs as you have described. My present time will not permit me to write much but I shall soon have another opportunity.  If Mrs. Wooley is a bad neighbor you must hire the House she lives in to Some body else & at a better rent. Mr. Henry must be ejected. You will See that his Rent was raised as a Step to that purpose & if necessary you will apply to a Lawyer under counsel from Mr. Gervais. Sammy Debat must be held with a tight rein, he is connected now with a very idle family & indulgence will ruin them & him.  I thought I had given orders to send as much of the Hams & Bacon to Mr. Gervais as he thot to take & to sell the rest, it was my intention to have done so, if Mr. Gervais does not want it now, sell it for the most it will yield. Poor Geofry, I am afraid his malady is beyond the Skill of the Baron. If the Baron will cure him I will give him half the Boy is worth for his trouble, but it would be mean to Sell him. If he Still lives consult Doctor Garden & Mr. Gervais & give him proper Cloths.  The Letter you mention for Mr. White did not come to hand.  Doctor Garden Should be consulted on the use of Betty & perhaps it may be necessary to take her into your Kitchen or to Send her into the Country.  Canto was working for the public at Braughton's Battery, my Accot. delivered in will shew to what day his Wages had been paid & you will remember my direction for him to Sleep at home & that you Should Send him in the Country if he attempted to play tricks. Mr. Gervais has an Accot. of my Brothers Rents & Negroes & probably you have before this time a Copy.  Public affairs here are in an unpleasant train. General Howe, tired with looking at General Washington without power to fight him quitted the Jerseys the beginning of July, about the middle embarked his Troops  AUGUST 11, 1777  Horse & foot Sailed out of Sandy Hook & made a parade with 228 Sail of vessels off the Capes of Delaware. From thence he disappeared about the 1st Inst. & may now be in the Moon for aught we know, but he is probably gone to New England & will Strive to join General Burgoine who found Ticonderoga evacuated & the Road clear for him down to Albany. Perhaps he may receive a check there; otherwise we shall be in a troublesome situation. Articles of every kind are exceedingly dear here. A Breast of Veal 55/ to 65/ our Currency. Butter 22/6 to a Dollar- meaning our Currency. Fire Wood when laid in the Cellar upwards of £22 a Chord. Horse feeding & Standing at Stable upwards a Dollar per day & every thing in proportion. It will cost me more to maintain 3 people here than it did to keep House & entertain Company at Ansonburgh. I hope we shall make something at home to ease this enormous weight. I fear all that my plantations will make will not support it. I thank Mrs. Loveday for her remembrance & desire my Compliments & good wishes to her & am &ca.  ""

  My dear Colonel, Philadelphia Aug. 13.1777 I have the pleasure at last of sending you some directions for making sugar; which I hope will be usefull.  You have my sincere thanks for your agreeable Letter by R.H.L. I am well pleased to find no abatement in your usual flow of good spirits. In spite of the cholic, I hope you will live long enough to see the down fall of this excessive fondness for popularity. It cannot long exist, in any great degree, where there are not many lucrative Offices in the gift of the people, and in Popular Governmts. I think the error is generally on the side of Parsimony. We are kept in great anxiety by the extraordinary manoevre of Genl. Howe, his going to sea with his Army; we can as yet only guess at his intentions. He was seen Last Fryday, about 50 miles to the southward of these capes, & perhaps may be in Chesapeak by the time you receive this, tho we think if he has any wisdom left he shoud go to the northward to cooperate with Burgoyne, whose genius, at present, seems to have the ascendency in his department. Our people there are still in a panic & Burgoyne's thoughtless activity is well calculated to keep it up. Our only comfort is, that the further he penetrates, the more surely he may be ruined; when they recover their senses. The Enemy have taken one of our finest frigates from us; but I believe we have one of theirs in return.  I have not yet had an opportunity of delivering your present to Doctr. Shippen. I am sure he will make every gratefull return in his power. You may be sure of your Sickles. It is so excessive hot & biting flies so plenty that I can scarce write.

  Philadelphia August 14. 1777 My dearest Friend Thursday We are still parching under the fierce Heats of Dog days It is agreed, by most People, that so long and so intense a Heat has scarcely been known. The Day before Yesterday, Dr. Ewing an eminent Philosopher as well as Mathematician, and Divine told me, the Spirit in his Glass, was at 91 in his cool Room, and from thence he concludes that it was above an hundred abroad in the Shade, because he says it is generally ten degrees lower, in his cool Room, than it is in the Shade out of Doors. Yesterday, it was at 94, abroad in the Shade. He placed his AUGUST 14, 1777  Thermometer, against a Post which had been heated by the Sun, and the Spirit arose to an 100, but removing it to another Place, and suspending it at a distance from any warrn Object and the Spirit subsided and settled at 94. How we shall live through these Heats I dont know.  If Howes Army is at Sea, his Men between Decks will suffer, beyond Expression. Persons, here, who have been at Sea, upon this Coast, at this Season of the Year, say, the Heat is more intollerable, on Shipboard than on Land. There is no Comfort to be had any where, and the Reflection of the Sun Rays from the Deck, are insufferable.  I wish this Wiseacre may continue to coast about untill an equinoctial Storm shall overtake him. Such a Thing would make fine Sport for his Fleet.  The Summer is consuming, and there is not Time enough left, for accomplishing many Things. If he should land tomorrow, it would take him three Weeks to reach Philadelphia. On the Jersey Side of the Delaware, is an ugly Road for him-many Rivers, Bridges, Causeys, Morasses, by breaking up of which, a Measure which is intended, and for which Preparations are made, his Army might be obstructed, puzzled and confounded in their March. His Army cannot proceed without many Horses, Waggons, and Cannon with their Carriages, for the Passage of which he must make new Bridges and Causeys, which would consume much Time, besides that he would be exposed, to the Militia and to the regular Army. On the other side the River there are several Streams and one large River to cross-the Schuylkill. And We have many fine Fire ships to annoy his Fleet. It would be happy for Us if he should aim at this Place, Because it would give Us an Opportunity of exerting the whole Force of the Continent against him. The Militia of the Jerseys, Pensilvania, Delaware and Maryland, would cooperate with Washington here those of N.Y. and N. England with Gates.

  Dear Sir(1) 14th August 1777 My journey to this yet fine City was in general pleasant the air rather hot till I reached the Mountains in the back of No Carolina about the 2d July where I found the Mornings so very cool as to require buttoned Coat & Wastcoat till the Sun mounted an hour or two & the whole day like our fine air in November, below. I travelled the upper Road 300 Miles from the Sea where to my equal Surprize & pleasure I found the Country more fully inhabited than even is between Purysburgh & Charles Town. The Landskapes are delightful, fine Farms & almost without exception abounding with Crops of Grain, Cotton, Flax & Sheep. The Spinning Wheel & Loom are seen on every farm & very few with less than Eight Children, that number seemed almost to be the Standard. What an increase will an Age or two of peace make. Water & Air are excellent. Bread the Staff of Life abundant. Fine pastures & Meadows consequently good Horses, black Cattle, Sheep, Hogs & Fowl of every kind. Thus circumstanced almost the sole complaint of these people was the want of Salt which had been very scarce & dear & so continued. They make good Spirit from Peaches, Barley & other grain & Substitute Honey for Sugar, in the Winter they brew good Ale & Beer & generally are well provided with Cyder but this year the Cold Spring destroyed the growth  AUGUST 14, 1777  of Apples. Conquer the Country who may, it will in time become the Scene of Health, wealth, Arts & Sciences & extend thousands of Miles back. The prospect is unbounded. The Envy of our Older Brethren in England has fooled them to attempt to check & restrain this growth, had they any knowledge of the Subject they would see the impossibility of success, they would be convinced that their Labours for that purpose will be as fruitless as an attempt to build a Bridge from Plymouth to Philadelphia. The work which they have taken in hand may be compared to that of building a Babel & it will have Similar effects, the builders will be confounded, will leave off the work & be scattered upon the face of the Earth, already many hundreds amounting to thousands have deserted their work & become good Americans. In the mean time it cannot be denied that we the faithful representatives of posterity feel many a hard Stroke from their rude & sorry am I to Say it, barbarian hands-Cursed by those who have borne false witness against us & encouraged this unjust persecution & all those who now from avarice & Interested motives look at our distresses with pleasure & the cruel hope of seeing our burthens increased.  My Son John [is] in the family of General Washington who is now encamped on the Northern Road, waiting to learn the grand design of Sir William Howe who has been amusing us with movements as yet inexplicable for a whole Month past. About the middle of July we received certain advice of the embarkation of his Horse soon after of the Infantry & upon the 23d a Fleet of 250 Sail in three divisions Shot Sandy Hook & Stood to Sea about SE. The 2d or 3d day after this invincible Armada was seen from the Jersey Shoar near the Cape, next it appeared off the Capes 228 Sail distinctly counted from our look out & so much in earnest did the conductors seem to be to enter the Delaware that about 40 or 60 Sail came actually within the Bay & the rest made a show of following as fast as circumstances would admit. After all their parade they stood to Sea again & on the 1st August were seen Steering E.N.E. with a strong southerly Wind which would have brought the whole fleet into this River in a few hours if Philadelphia had been their object. 'Tis to be supposed that some of the Rascally Tories had by this time informed General Howe of General Washington's arrival with his army near this City. Most people apprehend that to have been the thing he wished for & concluded that the fleet had Sailed to the Eastward, that the Troops would debark in some part of New England, that Country be attacked on all sides & a junction secured with the Army under Mr. Burgoyne. While we were in this suspense we received certain intelligence about 3 days ago of the Fleet or a Fleet of upwards of 200 Sail which must be the Same Seen off Sinnepuxent on the Maryland Shore & the same intelligence has been repeated. In the mean time we learn not a Syllable of Sir Wms. Army appearing any where to the Northward or Eastward. This riddle gives rise to a thousand conjectures. Every politician forms  & retails his own opinion. Some who pretend to be deepest say Phyladelphia is certainly the object in view. I reply, if it is, Sir Willm. Howe is more indulgent than ever Sir Peter Parker. In order to be quite right in my guess I declare I know not where they are gone nor whither bound. A few days probably hours will inform us. The evacuation of Ticonderoga has raised universal complaints against Generals Schuyler & St Clair who are both remanded in order to answer an Enquiry which will be made into their conduct respectively. General Gates is gone to relieve Mr Schuyler & to assume the Command of the Northern department which is now the very post of Honour. Tis said the Eastern people who detested his successor (2) adore him & will join him with alacrity. In this view me thinks he is in a delicate Situation. I wish him Success; upon that I may Say almost depends the Cause of America. If he gives Burgoyne an effectual Check the British Campaign will be over & Gates will Stand next to Washington; this will ever have the lead in America & an illustrious character in future history.  General Burgoyne announced his Entry upon the territory of the United States by a pompous proclamation in which in very affected language he is lavish of friendly promises to Tories & property men & not less profuse in denunciations against those who dare treat him as Junius did set him at Defiance.(3) Unhappily already for many who had confided in his promises of protection, they have fallen a Sacrifice to the ferocity of his gentle Allies the barbarian Indians. These even in presence of the British Savages have murdered & scalped some men & many women & Children who in obedience to the proclamation had remained quietly at home & removed none of their effects. Innocent young girls whose parents thought them in perfect safety & indeed under the protection of the British Commander have been taken as they were amusing themselves in the fields & inhumanely Butchered.  I hope General Gates will stop their progress. Gentlemen who are better acquainted with the Country than I am, say if the New England Militia are in earnest Mr. Burgoyne may not only be checked but his retreat cut off. In the meantime the number of auxiliaries which he may have collected from among Tories is altogether uncertain.  We have lately received very flattering intelligence from our Agents at Paris & in the West Indies. The French Court have lent us a round Sum of Money at an easy Interest, have reiterated assurances of keeping their ports open to our Ships, Commercial & Warlike, but are extremely shy with respect to recognizing our Independence & entering into a formal Treaty. Until they do both I will have no confidence in them. Every thing else is consistent with their own Interest & may be calculated & made use of hereafter to our further distress. For the Money lent they have the best security in the World & may raise the amount with large Interest at the Bank of England whenever they please, or may compel us to pay four fold in Land, which by one of their movements though cau-  tiously made they seem to aim at. In order to draw them from their seeming attachment to our Cause have made one Concession by offering them a large share of the Newfoundland Fishery.(4) The awful Frenchman waits no doubt to learn the highest bidding before he will explain; In the meantime he is certainly by Suffering his subjects to cruize upon the British Trade under Congress Commissions which at an hundred Sail at least so, offering poor old England such Insults as she has never been accustomed to Submit to.  Chesapeak Bay, Delaware, New York, Rhode Island having been long blocked up by British Men of War every article of foreign goods is become scarce & extravagantly dear. Hence the Farmer & Labourer have enhanced their several demands. Consequently those who have neither Merchandize nor Farms to live by & who give their Labours to the public are greatly oppressed. I am one in that Class & you will judge of the vast expence I am put to even for a Scanty decent living from the inclosed accot of prices---exclusive of Cloths I dont think I can live half so well as I had at home & maintain only two instead of a dozen Servants for £1500 Sterling a year.  French Marquisses, Counts, Barons & Chevaliers in pursuit of Commissions & of the honour of fighting for what is a mere phantom in their Country, \""Liberty,\"" overrun Philadelphia, living at a very dear rate, four Dollars for a warm dinner & as they have been accustomed to get for half an one many of these are truly to be pitied. For although Liberty is visionary in their Native clime, they are not ignorant of its estimate. From many accounts which I have seen from France, however artful the Court may be, the people in general wish us success & seem to feel themselves Interested in our Cause. If we attain to our wishes of confirming Independence I have no doubt but that in a few years there will be an addition to our number of some hundred thousands from the Continent of Europe. This very circumstance may possibly weigh with proud Kings & prevent their giving us all that assistance which otherwise they would.  The loss of Manly & the fine Frigate he Commanded is not a trifle, however he fought more bravely than his Captor is pleased to declare. Another Account in the Royal Gazette of New York says his Ship was so much Shattered she would not have swam to New York; she was therefore sent to Halifax. His fall was glorious, nor did he fall before he had convinced the World that the British Flag might be Struck to the American. The taking of the Fox of 32 Guns was a great act, according to English estimation she should have been an overmatch for Cap Manly's. I believe the Fox is retaken & what is equally unfortunate the Commander of her was on board the Hancock, which deprives us of the means for Exchanging our brave Captain. Every day now teems with important events. This Campaign will, whether successful or not, spin the Web of British power to a fineness which will expose it to extreme danger from foreign blasts. Granting Britain should acquire a  farther extent of Sea Coast unless she conquers the hearts of half a million of Men determined not to submit to her the Conquest will but accelerate her down-fall. The more I see into the Subsisting dispute the more confirmed am I in the opinion which I have often declared to you -whatever may be the State of us the friends of America & whatever may be the Issue of our Contest, America is lost to Britain. There is but one way to regain all the advantages which she can hope for from Commerce with this Country, a Treaty. This 'tis probable would soon be attempted if the parties knew each others mind.  I shall not at present trouble you on the Subject of my own affairs; the confidence which I place in your friendship renders it unnecessary. You will save me if possible from farther illegal & unjust Strokes. I find that was one which was made under the authority of Mr. Dillon to which I must for a while Submit. I will beg of you to deliver the enclosed to Mr. Baillie half an hour. Present my Compliments to Mr Patterson & believe me to be with the most friendly regard & esteem &ca.  ""

  Dear Sir,(1) 15th August 1777 I arrived within half a mile of this City the 20th July where I halted for a night in order to adjust a plan for innoculating three persons who had travelled with me, Mr John Ball, his Black Boy & one of mine. Thank God they have passed very happily through the small Pox, neither of them were confined by the disorder 24 hours.  My journey although it would Seem long to count from the 7 June to 20 July was travelled in less than thirty days. I came the upper Road & when I had reached the Mountains about the 2d July I found the air extremely pleasant so cool in the Evenings & mornings as to make it necessary to button a Coat over the Wastcoat & so it continued until I approached this City. Here it is warm enough. The last fortnight has been intensely hot, I am now writing in an open room & striped to my Shirt, yet I am so moistened as to oblige me to use a paper under my hand & the nights are worse. I fear my friends in Charles Town must suffer more, but perhaps not, you may there have refreshing breezes from the Sea, here we are Shut up from all breezes.  On my journey I found every where plentiful Crops of Grain together with Cotton, Flax & Hemp, almost every House with Looms for Linen & Woolen & few with less than eight Children. The Country is delightful & no heavy complaints but for the want of Salt. Many other articles are Scarce & dear but the people can either do without or find Some substitute for such. I believe they have Scarcely Salt enough to Serve for the ensuing Winter's provision. Nevertheless they seem in general contented to bear inconveniencies in preference to British Taxes. For you scarcely find a Tory or a disaffected person to our righteous Cause among the Back Settled people in that part of the Country.  When Sir William Howe had been obliged to abandon New Jersey & to take Some new Step to distress us, he embarked his Troops, Horse & foot near New York between the 5th & 21st July & on the 23d sailed from Sandy Hook with a fleet of about 250 Sail great & Small in three divisions & stood to Sea about a South East course. Great care was taken to make a Show of the Fleet as it sailed along the Jersey Shore, the latter end of July 228 Sail were counted from our look out near the Capes of Delaware & every appearance was made of a design to come up this River, about 60 Sail came within the Bay & the remainder affected to be Standing in. These movements brought General Washington by very fatiguing Countermarches from the Clove about 120 Miles distance to the environs of this City. On the 1st August the fleet stood to Sea again Steered E.N.E. with a fresh Southerly breeze. It then became the general opinion they were bound for New England & had made a feint in order to draw General Washington this way & to harrass his Troops. After waiting Several days in uneasy Suspence, AUGUST 15, 1777  to our great Surprize we learned that the Same fleet was seen off Sinnepuxent on the Coast of Maryland. This advice has been confirmed by different Expresses, the last added that they had been seen steering Southerly with a Wind about South East. General Washington has marched his Army & is encamped about 21 Miles hence on the North Road where I suppose he will wait for further intelligence. 'Tis true Soldiers march quicker on Ships than we can on Shoar, but those various movements clearly demonstrate the difficulties which the British Generals have to encounter in their present dispute.  The loss of Ticonderoga has occasioned an universal clamour. General Schuyler & St. Clair are remanded in order to answer at a Court of Enquiry & General Gates sent by Congress to the Command of that department. He is said to be a favorite with the people of New England & that thousands who had abandoned Mr. Schuyler will immediately join him.  General Burgoyne who sent a very pompous proclamation as his forerunner towards Albany had met with very little opposition & had advanced within 25 or 30 Miles of that City the 4th Inst. He had marked his progress with the blood of many Innocent people chiefly Women who had been butchered & scalped by his Indians in Sight of British Troops, these unhappy people had remained quietly on their Lands in obediance to Mr. Burgoyne's proclamation. Every body hopes his cruel progress will be Stopped by General Gates & those who are well acquainted with the Country say his retreat will be cut off. He is a bold enterprizing Officer inclined rather to be rash, if he is as foolish in his Marching as he is in his writing I have no doubt but he will soon meet with a Check. Time must show the event. This Month will be marked with blood.  Our Accounts from France are all very flattering but methinks I perceive great artifice in the whole behaviour of that Court. We have in my opinion been much too forward in our offers of Treaty. The British Court on the other hand has made a proposition to them of some concession in the New Foundland Fishery. They are waiting to see who will bid most or possibly where they can make most, in the meantime benefiting by our trade & insulting the Flag & Commerce of poor old England in a degree which must gall that high Spirited nation.  Tis very true France has lent us a large Sum of Money but I do not pass that to the Credit of friendship. She has the best Security in the World for principal & Interest & may raise both at the Bank of England whenever she pleases, or may compel us to repay upon her own terms.  The midle rank of people & many of higher degree are panting for our Success in full prospect of participating Liberty. Nothing more   natural than this, but how the King & his Court enjoy the prospect of losing thousands of their Subjects is a question which time must Solve. Upon the whole I have no confidence in France that she will take one Step for us but such as lead to her own Interest & Security. This would lead me into an hours conversation.  The Consequence of having all our ports blocked up is scarcity of such articles as were wont to be imported from abroad & advanced prices. These are met by advances nearly equal on the part of the Farmer & Labourer-a schedule of which I will inclose. People therefore who are not concerned in Merchandize or Farming & hold no profitable Office under Government bear the weight of this extraordinary charge. I find myself in this Class, if I live half as well as I have been accustomed to at home fifteen hundred pounds Sterling will not pay one years expences exclusive of Clothing.  My Son John is now one of General Washington's family. I have no doubt of his being very happy there & am persuaded he will be very useful to the General. Our Seperation at the hour of parting weighed down my Spirits more than I had suspected it would. I felt it as the greatest disappointment I had ever Suffered nor could I forbear the intimation to himself. I wish he had made a choice for his outset in Life where he might have been more extensively useful to his Country where he might have been the long expected Support to mine & the builder of his own family. If I had suspected the contrary I should have-what should I have done-whatever is best, because nothing is but by the direction of Supreme wisdom & goodness. 'Tis the Duty of Man to bear Seeming misfortune & reason himself into conviction that there is no real misfortune & ever to be Thankful for the good which he has enjoyed.  Adieu My dear sir. My good wishes are ever with you & yours. I beg you to present my respectful Compliments to Mrs. Mannigault, Mr Joseph & the young Ladies & to accept the repeated assurance of being, your much obliged humble Servant  ""

  Philadelphia August 17. 1777 My dearest Friend Sunday  Yesterday We had a cool Day, the Wind Easterly and cloudy, this Morning there is a brisk northeast Wind and cool Rain, which restores Us, to some Comfort. A Number of People died here with excessive Heat, besides others, who fell Sacrifices to their own Imprudence in drinking cold Water.  This Wind will oblige the Knight Errant and his Fleet, to go some where or other. We have had no Intelligence of it, since last Thursday week.  We have a Letter from G Schuyler. in which he \""is not insensible of the Indignity of being call'd away, when an Action must soon take Place.\"" But I hope, the People will not resent this Indignity, so as not to turn out. G Gates I hope, will be able to find Men, who will stand by him. Never was there a fairer opportunity, than now presents of ruining Burgoigne. By the same Letter, We have confused Hints, that an Attack has been made upon Fort Schuyler, and the Enemy repulsed.(1) AUGUST 17, 1777  The Letter seems to suppose, that he had written a fuller Account of it before. But no such Account has reached Us.  The Enemy at Niagara and Detroit, are endeavouring to seduce the Indians, to take up the Hatchet, but as yet, with little success. They seem determined to maintain their Neutrality.  I read a Letter last Evening directed to Mr. Serjeant, and in his Absence to me from Mr. Clark a Delegate from N. Jersey who is gone Home to Elizabeth Town for his Health, giving a particular Account of Howes Army, in their late precipitate Retreat from Westfield. They were seized with the Utmost Terror, and thrown into the Utmost Confusion. They were so weak and sickly, and had gorged themselves so with fresh Meat, that they fell down in the Roads, many died, and were half buried, &c. &c. &c.  We have many new Members of Congress, among whom are Mr. Vandyke of Delaware, Mr. Jones of Virginia, and Mr. Lawrence of S. Carolina. This last Gentleman is a great acquisition-of the first Rank in his State, Lt. Governor, of ample Fortune, of great Experience, having been 20 Years in their assembly, of a clear Head and a firm Temper, of extensive Knowledge, and much Travel. He has hitherto appeared as good a Member, as any We ever had in Congress. I wish that all the States would imitate this Example and send their best Men. Vandyke is a Lawyer, and a very worthy Man, his Abilities very good and his Intensions very sincere. Mr. Jones also is a Lawyer, but has so lately come in that We have seen as yet no Exhibitions of him.  ""

  Dear Sir(1) 17th August 1777 The News paper which I shall Send with this will give you a pretty distinct Account of the State of the War in this quarter. I may add that we have begun to give General Burgoyne's Savage Allies a Check. An attack was made on Fort Schuyler by a detachment from Burgoyne's main body aided by Tories & Indians. Colonel Gansevor Commander of the Fort made a Sally from within & took 4 pieces of Cannon & 2 Royals. General Harkimer of New York Militia had an engagement with them, in which he suffered considerably but kept the field & counted after the Action 50 Indians lying dead. This will give that Tribe some kind of check & we hope a more effectual one will Soon to be given to the head Savage Burgoyne himself. Who can forbear calling him Savage when he boasts of Sending them to Murder Innocent Women & Children, which they have done to a shocking extent & even to many who had taken Shelter under his proclamation. The last Account we heard of the Grand New York Fleet was their Steering southerly from the Coast of Maryland. The Season of the year would seem to forbid it but I am not without apprehensions of a sudden attack on the land side upon Sullivants Island-where else but there or Georgia can that fleet be destined. I am not free from deep feelings for you all.  Your Brother John lodges at Doctor Bond's for the benefit he says of taking advice & Medicine for a pain in his Side, he went happily through the Small Pox & left on about the 11th Inst. in a manner not Satisfactory to me, I had taken as much care of him as if he had been AUGUST 17, 1777  my Son & had intended him some essential Service if he had continued longer under my protection.(2)  Present me in cordial terms to your Father & Sister.

  Dear Sir 17th August 1777 I refer to my last Letter of the 5th Inst & 16th Inst.(1) by the hand of a Georgia Officer dispatched by Colo. Walton. This will be delivered or forwarded to you by Colo. Sumpter who gives me very short warning of his design to leave Philadelphia to morrow morning. I am just going to attend a Committee (2) where I shall be detained till tis very late. Excuse me therefore for crowding together as much as I can in a few minutes.  We have heard from the Northern department by a Letter from Gen Schuyler the 10th Inst.(3) Fort Schuyler had been attacked by the Enemy, Colo Gansevort Commandant of the Fort by a timely sortie had taken 4 feild pieces & two royals. General Harkimer in the field near the Fort had engaged them, had suffered some loss but kept the ground, drove them off & counted after the action 50 Indians Iying dead on the Field, many wounded were carried off. That number in one affair will appear considerable to the Surviving Indians & I am in hopes will incline them to go home as their custom is after much blood in order to take breath.  As Mr. Burgoyne had made no impossible from the 4th to the 10th we hope General Gates who must have been at the head of the Army about the 12th will put a stop to his further progress. 500 Rifle Men under a Select Commander are ordered by Congress to join General Gates immediately.(4) He cannot yet learn what is become of the Fleet which Sailed from New York the 23d Inst., appeared off the Capes  AUGUST 17, 1777  of Delaware the 28th to the 1st August, then vanished, appeared again upon the Coast of Maryland the 7 & 8th Inst. & was last day seen Standing Sotherly. If we do not hear to morrow of their arrival in Cheasapeek Bay many people notwithstanding the forbidding Season of the year will be anxious for Carolina & Georgia.  General Burgoyne according to the menace in his extraordinary proclamation has given Stretch to his Savage friends.(5) We received advices yesterday from Colo. Morgan of many murders committed by Indians on the western frontiers of Virginia & Pensylvania, with these Butchers a few Canadians & British are joined. Where they murder they leave Proclamations from the General & say all the Savages on the frontiers of the United Colonies are to attack in that Side while 100000 British Troops are to enter Pensylvania, Virginia, Charles Town & Georgia from the Sea Side.  General Hand who Commands at Fort Pitt & Colo. Morgan seem to be under no apprehension of being routed. They intimate that Britain will have the Glory of Murdering many helpless Innocent Men, Women & Children & bring on the destruction of their friends. In preparation for this purpose they recommend to carry the War directly into their own Country & the most Speedy measures are adopted for that purpose.(6)  If any thing above mentioned will be acceptable to Mr. Wells please to give it him or to Mr. Timothy if his Gazette is to come first out. I need not Say I dont wish to appear as a News Correspondent. I never write News without good grounds apparently & I believe now every word I have written to be true but to morrow may contradict or vary all that does not proceed from authority.  I beleive that nothing less than the mode of a parliamentary enquiry into the Conduct of the Officers in the Northern department will content the people. For the purpose of answering Gen Schuyler will be in or near this City in a few days. We hear not a word from Genl. St. Clair nor do we know where he is-probably with the advanced Army.

  Dear Sir 17th August 1777 I have before me a Letter which I intend to trouble your Excellency with by the hand of a special Messenger from Colo. Walton to morrow who will probably be in Charles Town before Colonel Sumpter the bearer of this.  The News paper inclosed with this will shew we have begun to give Mr. Burgoynes Savage Allies a Check, & as General Gates must have been already to look him in the face Some days ago we expect soon to hear that Mr. Burgoyne himself has been stopped in his Career. He has indeed given \""Stretch§' to his Indians, large bodies of these headed by a few British & Canadian Soldiers have butchered many an Innocent Woman, Girl & Child upon the Frontiers of Virginia & Pensylvania. We received yesterday an Account of their Murders from General Hand & Colo. Morgan at Fort Pit. General Hand recommends to carry the War directly into their own Towns & every measure for that purpose will be expeditiously pursued.  Congress have now before them a plan for borrowing ten Millions Dollars. I hope the Carolina Delegates will oppose the mode much favoured by particular persons & Succeed. The Interest of all the States is concerned.(1)  As the destination of the grand Fleet from New York remains to us a Secret & that our last Report from Maryland was their being Seen Steering Southerly with the Wind at So. So.E. I am not free from apprehensions of an attack upon South Carolina-aware at the same time of the hazard from autumnal distempers & Tempests-but we are exposed to them as much as they are a Sudden debarkation upon Sullivant's Island would put as much greater hazard on our Side & certain other movements give us cause to wish we had employed our Engineers, Carpenters & Labourers to good purposes during twelve past Months. We have heard from General Schuyler as late as the 11th Inst & about the 11th from Peek's Kill.

I reached this place the 21st July.  Your application for leave to arm half your Regiment with Smooth bores & bayonets lies before the board of War-where a multiplicity of business may keep back a report many days. In the mean time I am well assured Congress will have no objection to your arming agreeable to your desire provided His Excellency the president shall judge the variation to be for the good of the Service. Make your application here or possibly with propriety to the General Commanding in the Southern department. From thence also you must expect to be supplied with Arms. There has been I am informed great waste made in this quarter & there is now an universal Cry for Muskets for the Militia.(2)  I have employed a proper person to enquire for a Bolting Cloth for you-the article is become very scarce & the price at least four times doubled of the former rate. I mean such as I have yet discovered, if I can find none cheaper I must Send you one by next opportunity. Tis an article which I suppose you cannot dispence with.  News as in Mr. Gervais's last Letter dated 17th Inst.(3)  The time is teeming with some grand event. The British Forces in this quarter Seem to be Struggling their last. If they do not conquer tis probable they will withdraw but tis hardly possible they should do so without one more attempt upon Sullivants Island if they make it suddenly by Land. I think more than is necessary to be Said to you on that Subject; you know what must follow.  This River is blocked up by four Men of War, every article of Life is amazingly dear.

  My dear Sir, Philadelphia, 17th Aug. 1777. Were it not for the very disgraceful evacuation of Ticonderoga and the loss of our Stores there, we should have little but good to relate of this Campaign as far as it has gone. The Generals Schuyler and St. Clair are ordered down to Head Quarters, where an enquiry will be instituted, and the public fully acquainted with the whole of that business. Gen. Gates is reappointed to the command of the Northern Army and by this time has joined it. The Militia is turning out to join that army, and now that they have the General they love and can confide in, I hope our affairs in that quarter will soon wear a better countenance. Already Gen. Hackerman of the N. York Militia has beaten a part of the enemies forces and slain 50 Indians .(1) Gen. Howes fleet was seen off the Eastern Shore of Maryland on the 7th instant, stearing southward, but it is somewhat doubtful whether his troops are on board now or not, and if they are, it is. surely the strangest Manoeuvre that was ever before put in practice-For, is it not wonderful, that whilst Burgoyne is pushing into the Country on one quarter, Howe should quit it on another? Time will explain this, at present, inexplicable movement. In the meantime Gen. Washingtons forces are so placed as to be ready to meet Mr. Howes visitation if it happens any where but on the two extremes of the United States. Our information from Europe does not promise us immediate war, but we are sure of very substantial aid from thence, whilst the powerful Armaments quickly preparing by France and Spain denote approaching war and certainly will check the British violence against [us?] by the necessity it creates of watching their powerful and dangerous Neighbors. The spirit of France rises with the increase of its Fleet, since we learn that when the British Ambassador lately told the Ministry that if N. America continued to be supplied from France, that the Peace could not long continue-He was answered 'Nous ne desiron pas la guerre, et nous ne le craignon pas.' (2) Dr. Lee is returned from Spain, and set out in May for the Court of Prussia. Gen. Lee is removed on board the Centurion, but we are not certain whether the ship remains at York or is gone with the Fleet. We hear that a Speech of Lord Chathams in the house of Lords lately has come to N. York, but they will not publish it, in which his Lordship advises them to make peace with America  AUGUST 17, 1777  immediately on Any terms, assuring them they have no more chance to conquer this Country with the force they have or can get, than he to conquer Britain with his Crutch, and that the longer they contend the more certain will be their ruin and disgrace.(3) The good old Man, instead of being dead as was reported, is, it seems, recovered to better health and revived powers.  Pray my dear Sir urge on our Works near the Falls of James River, we want heavy cannon extremely-And it would be greatly to our advantage if Copper and Calamine could be found in quantity sufficient to furnish us with Brass. My compliment to Mrs. Page.  Farewell dear Sir Affectionately yours.  P.S. If Government was now and then to stimulate the Managers of the Salt Works, might we not hope for a supply of that necessary. I fear Howe is gone to Charles Town in South Carolina. If so, against such a Land and Sea force no effectual resistance can be made____  curse on his Canvas Wings. MS not found; reprinted from Lee, Letters (Ballagh), 1:315-17.  1 Brig. Gen. Nicholas Herkimer of the New York militia had been mortally wounded at Oriskany on August 6 while attempting to relieve Fort Schuyler.

  My dear Sir, Philadelphia 17th Augt. 1777 We are not able yet to give you any account of the wandering Howe and his fleet, save that they were seen on the 7th instant off Sinapuxen stearing Southward. Our accounts from France say that George depends much on the \""desperate efforts that Howe & Cornwallis must make to redeem their Bankrupt honor.\"" (1) His present Manoeuvre seems the effort of a despairing Bankrupt. For what good can result from having multitudes of Men & Horses confined on board Ships at this season of the year, exposed to the torrid hell that beams upon their heads? Gen. Washingtons forces are well placed to meet Gen. Howes return, unless he should visit either extreme of the United States. The main body is about 20 miles from hence on the road to Coryells ferry on both sides of which the Carolina Troops & other Corps (about 2000) are stationed. Sullivan with 2000 more is in the Neighbrhood of Morris Town, & Gen.  AUGUST 17, 1777  Putnam with about 5000 occupies the Heights at Peekskill. I lately visited the Army here. It realy makes a fine appearance. Health, discipline, and good spirits, prevail thro the whole. I wish things lookt as well in the North, however I hope they will soon mend in that quarter. Gen. Gates is reappointed to the command there, and the Militia are turning out. Already Gen. Hackerman of the N. York Militia has had an engagement with a part of the enemy and beaten them, having killed 50 Indians on the spot. Congress has ordered 500 Riflemen from this Army to be sent up there immediately to check and chastise the-Barbarian Auxiliaries that Burgoyne has brought with him and who are murdering & scalping all before them, Men, Women, & Children; without sparing those who have taken protection & sworn allegiance to the Tyrant. Even inveterate Tories feel the keen edge of the Scalping Knife, and the barbarous butchery of the Tomahawk. Gens. Schuyler & St. Clair are ordered to Head Quarters that an enquiry may be had into the loss of Ticonderoga and its valuable Stores. Tis a shocking affair and cannot, at present, be accounted for. Our accounts from France, late in May, do not promise immediate war, but substantisl aid most certainly. Both France & Spain are arming powerfully and with great rapidity. The spirit of the former rises as its Fleet grows stronger, since we understand that the Minister lately replied to Lord Stormont, when he said the peace could not long continue if N. America continued to draw supplies from France, \""Nous ne desiron pas la guerre, et nous ne le craignon pas.\"" We neither desire War, nor fear it. The potent armaments of two such dangerous Neighbors must infallibly check the efforts of G. Britain against us, by putting her under a necessity of watching them, and being prepared to defend herself. Doctr. Lee is returned from Spain and gone to the Court of Prussia. I suppose William will soon take his place. Lord Chatham is not dead as report made him, but it seems is better in health than usual, and we understand a late speech of his is arrived at N. York, in which he advises the Lords \""that Peace be made with N. America immediately and on any terms, assuring them they had no more chance to conquer this Continent with the force they had or could get than he would have to conquer Britain with his Crutch and that the longer they carried on the War the more certain would be their ruin, and the greater their disgrace.\"" Wise and good Old Man, what pity is it that if Kings will be allowed, they cannot be directed by such Men!  I believe Manly is certainly taken & the Fox retaken.(2) They were greatly overpowered by superior force. My best wishes attend the family at Mansfield.  Farewell dear Sir, Affectionately yours, Richard Henry Lee  [P.S.] Colo. Lee & Lady are well.  P.S Since neither the Northern or Southern posts of this day bring us any account of Howes fleet I am almost sure that he is gone to Charles  AUGUST 18, 1777  Town South Carolina, which, in its present state, against such a great Land & Sea force, cannot stand. It must fall. Curse on his Canvass Wings. Tis an unfair advantage they take of us. R.H. Lee  ""

  My Dear Sir August 18th 1777.  I have nothing material to inform you of beyond what the Gazette contains, except in confidence, that it is a disputed point whether we shall go upon the scheme of drawing Bills of Exchange on France to carry interest after a certain day if not paid, hoping that bankers and merchants will discharge them upon the plighted faith of these States, or whether we shall only draw from the interest due on our Loan certificates to be paid out of a fund already visible and of most probable increase. Should the first plan take place, the mercantile part here would immediately run mad after the Bills, and so sink the Loan Office supply; whereas the certainty of dollar for dollar interest would encourage the Loan business, would induce the merchant to pay off widow's and orphan's dues to them, increase his claim of interest to be paid by Bills of Exchange at the offices and would give credit to our tickets in France where they will be bought up at par or a trifling discount. In the mean time we may tax very considerably to lessen the quantity of current paper by burning Colonial. Honesty and justice are for the last, fear and cunning are for the first. I will give you early intelligence of the decision; I only add that the last is the opinion also of our Commissioners, who have hinted a further plan for laying out land on the Mississippi as an object of a Subscription in France. This is much more honest than selling Bills without a known fund.  Schuyler has heard of the changes of command in the Northern Department, and is very angry but doubts not he shall receive the thanks of his country. As to the recruiting service which you mention in yours of the 5th measures have been taken which have gone to the General in Resolves and to the States. I will scratch a part of the only Northern Map I have if Monsieur A.B.C. &c will permit.  Your friend, J.L.  [P.S.] In the name of the Union what orders have you given to Stark? (1) He had better have tarried at home, than have marched so far as he has to refuse Continental regulations. He knew them before he set out. Maryland will not let her militia be under Continental Articles of War, but then she does not send her men out of the State till this is consented to. Secret and scandalous.  I do not know the merits of Stark's case but he makes great confusion.  Your Colleague opened the enclosed according to your orders.  ""

  My best Friend Aug. 19, 1777 Tuesday Your obliging Favour of the 5th came by Yesterdays Post, and I intended to have answered it by this Mornings Post, but was delayed by many Matters, untill he gave me the slip.  I am sorry that you and the People of Boston were put to so much Trouble, but glad to hear that such Numbers determined to fly. The Prices for Carting which were demanded, were detestable. I wish your Fatigue and Anxiety may not have injured your Health.  Dont be anxious, for my Safety. If Howe comes here I shall run away, I suppose with the rest. We are too brittle ware you know to stand the Dashing of Balls and Bombs. I wonder upon what Principle the Roman Senators refused to fly from the Gauls and determind to sit, with their Ivory Staves and hoary Beards in the Porticoes of their Houses untill the Enemy entered the City, and altho they confessed they resembled the Gods, put them to the Sword.  I should not choose to indulge this sort of Dignity, but I confess I feel myself so much injured by these barbarean Britains, that I have a strong Inclination to meet them in the Field. This is not Revenge I believe, but there is something sweet and delicious in the Contemplation of it. There is in our Hearts, an Indignation against Wrong, that is righteous and benevolent, and he who is destitute of it, is defective in the Ballance of his Affections and in his moral Character.  As long as there is a Conscience in our Breasts, a moral Sense which distinguishes between Right and Wrong, approving, esteeming, loving the former, and condemning and detesting the other, We must feel a Pleasure in the Punishment, of so eminent a Contemner of all that is Right and good and just, as Howe is. They are virtuous and pious Passions that prompt Us to desire his Destruction, and to lament and deplore his success and Prosperity.  The Desire of assisting towards his Disgrace, is an honest Wish.  It is too late in Life, my Constitution is too much debilitated by AUGUST 19, 1777  Speculation, and indeed it is too late a Period in the War, for me to think of girding on a sword: But if I had the last four Years to run over again, I certainly would.

The Gentlemen from South Carolina, begin to tremble for Charlestown.  If Howe is under a judicial Blindness, he may be gone there. But what will be the Fate of a scorbutic Army cooped up in a Fleet for Six, Seven or Eight Weeks in such intemperate Weather, as We have had.  What will be their Condition landing, on a burning shore abounding with Agues and Musquetos, in the most unwholesome Season of the whole Year ?  If he should get Charlestown, or indeed the whole State, what Progress will this make towards the Conquest of America? He will stop the Trade of Rice and Indigo, but what then? Besides he will get some ugly Knocks. They are honest, sincere and brave and will make his Life uncomfortable.  I feel a strong Affection for S. Carolina, for several Reasons. 1. I think them as stanch Patriots as any in America. 2. I think them as brave. 3. They are the only People in America, who have maintained a Post and defended a Fort. 4. They have sent Us a new Delegate, whom I greatly admire, Mr. Lawrence, their Lt. Governor, a Gentleman of great Fortune, great Abilities, Modesty and Integrity-and great Experience too. If all the States would send Us such Men, it would be a Pleasure to be here.  In the Northern Department they begin to fight. The Family of Johnson, the black part of it as well as the white, are pretty well thinned. Rascals ! they deserve Extermination. I presume Gates will be so supported that Burgoingne will be obliged to retreat. He will stop at Ticonderoga I suppose for they can maintain Posts, altho We can not.  I think We shall never defend a Post, untill We shoot a General. After that We shall defend Posts, and this Event in my Opinion is not far off. No other Fort will ever be evacuated without an Enquiry, nor any Officer come off without a Court Martial. We must trifle no more. We have suffered too many Disgraces to pass unexpiated. Every Disgrace must be wiped off.  We have been several Days, hammering upon Money.

  Sir War Office Augt l9th. 1777 There are about 80 Men with Officers for three Troops of Horse of thirty Men each now at Philadelphia. They came from North Carolina with General Nash's Brigade & have been here for a considerable Time their Horses being sold as they were unfit for Service & the Board were so embarrass'd with the high Price of Horses & other Necessaries for sending them into the Field that they had determined to order them back to N. Carolina. They were induced to do this too from the Men having refused to enlist during the War & they have only from 12 to 18 Months to serve. But it has been represented that they are all Americans & therefore the more to be depended upon & that many of the Regiments of Cavalry either from the Misbehaviour of the Men or Accidents have many Horses more than Men. The Board have therefore thought it best to represent the Matter to your Excellency for your Opinion upon it & desire to know how these Men could be employed & mounted. It seems they object to being drafted into the Regiments without their Officers but are willing to be annexed with them to any Regiment of Horse. Col Baylors would be most agreeable to them & it is said he has Horses & cannot get Men equal to the Number of Horses.

We have wrote two official Letters,(1) in the last of which we acquainted, that Congress had ordered an Enquiery to be made into the Losses sustaind in the northern Department, and that General Gates was appointed to take the Command there, and Genl. Scuyler & St. Clair orderd to repair to head Quarters. General Gates must have arrived eer now, and we cant but have great reason to hope that our Affairs in that Quarter will soon put on another Face, for if Burgoin Elated with his late Successes should push down much farther, he must leave such an opening that it will be in our power to throw such a body in his Front & Reer, that he must enevitably be cut off-especially if our People do but turn out and act with Spirit on this occasion, as we trust they will now their Confidence in their Commanders is restored.  We are still at a Loss what is become of Hows Fleet! The last we heard any thing about them, was that on the 8t instant they were off Sinepucscent Bar standing to the Southward.  General Washington with his Army is now encamp'd about 20 miles from hence, near Corels Ferry, waiting the movements of this Fleet- an oppertune Season now for an Attempt on New York.

Schoyler to the Command at the Northward gave great uneasiness to New Hampshire and I'l add to many other States also and that very justly. The Deligate from the Eastern States told Congress that the People in those States had no confidence in Sd. Genl. but the Influence of Said Man and the Deligates of New York (Dewane & Duer In my opinion is no better then their Genl.) had more wait in Congress at that time then all the Deligates from the Eastern States and Obtained a majority of one Vote in his favour, they now see the Ill Consequence of that Appointmt and have order'd Genl. Gates to Supersead him in that Command and sopose he is at that post if well before this time. Schoyler and St. Clear is orderd to head quarters in order for tryeul. I hope you'l furnish the Court of Inquiry with all the proofs Relating to the Situation that post was in and in what manner the troops was furnished. Schoyler & St. Clear writes to Congress and says most of the troops was old men, Boys, & negros and unfit for garison duty, their Armes very bad & but one bayinet to ten men, that many of the officers mutinous and a disgrace to an Armey, that he (Schoyler) wants power from Congress to Suspend AUGUST 19, 1777  them.(1) Thanks be to praise they are Suspended themselves. I Rejoice to here that our brave Countrimen are marching with Spirit & Viger to opose their Enemi. May the God of Armies go forth with 'm. Our Commissioners at the Courts of France and Spain have Established a loan for the payment of the Interest that is or may arrise on our money Issued by congress which we may draw from time to time on sd. Commissrs. at Paris at the Rate of five livers money of France for every Dollar which will we trust give our Loan office certificates as great if not greater Credit In Europe then the Bank notes of Great Britian as they carrey larger Interest and Incorage every Monied man with us to put his money in sd. office as they may be sure to Receive the Interest in Dollars as aforesaid and that these Courts have particuler strong Reasons for keeping out of the war as long as they can, besides the general one that on both sides the nation attacking losses the Claim which when attacked it has for aid from its allies and we have these advantages in their keeping out of the war (as long as they can) that they are better able to afford us private assistance that by holding them selves in Rediness to invade Britain they keep more of her forces at home and that they leave to our Armed Vessels the whole harvest of Prizes made upon her Commerce. The Commissioners have purchasd. 80,000 muskets, a number of pistols &c at second hand that if but one half arives safe they will be Cheep, all Europ is for us, the articles of Confediration and the Seperate Constiutions of the several States are published in France which affords abundance of Speculation to the Politicions of Europ and it is a very general Opinion that if we succeed in establishing our liberties we shall as soon as peace is restored receive an immence addition of numbers and welth from Europe.

Cursed and Detested will every one be that deserts or betrays it. The Congress is about setting the mode for drawing bills for the Interest of our money and it should be made publick that we now have a fund in France for the payment of the Interest [on?] our bills of Credit, which knolidge coming to the public [may] conduce them to put their money in to the loan Office, thereby we sopose may have a sufficient to carrey on the war without Emiting any more bills.

  My dear Sir,(1) Philadelphia l9th Augt. 1777 As it is always with pleasure that I obey your commands, so it is per- AUGUST 19, 1777  fectly agreable to me to make use of the opportunity offered by Mr. Butler of furnishing you with the present state of our affairs as well as I am able. Gen. Howe has thrown us all into the field of conjecture by his late embarkation, and various have been the opinions touching his destination. At present however, Many reasons concur to induce belief that he is gone to Charles Town in South Carolina, where unhappily for that place & for the Union in general, he may succeed. They are strong towards the sea, but all their fortifications are weak on the land side, and may be attacked with success in reverse. In fact, it does not seem likely that they can resist the great Land & Sea force that Mr. Howe has with him. It is not absolutely certain that he is gone to Charles Town, and therefore Gen. Washingtons army is obliged to remain inactive, a mere army of observation. This, added to a variety of other causes, gives Burgoyne an opportunity of figuring away in the North, and he uses the opportunity as might be expected from the abandoned servant of an abandoned Master. First he prevails with the people to remain with their Stocks on their plantations and [gives] protections to quiet their fears, immediately follow bands of Indians, some Canadians & Regulars, who scalp and murder all before them, neither age, sex, nor political character makes any difference. Men, women, children, whig, Tory, and Protectiontaker, all promiscuously feel the keen scalping knife and the murdering Tomahawk. This Burgoyne is a true Type of the Court he comes from; Howe & Carleton have some humanity. Very soon I hope his career will be stopt. Schuyler & St. Clair are ordered down to Head Quarters that an enquiry may be had into the loss of Ticonderoga &c. Gen. Gates by this time has joined the Northern Army as Commander of it Gates is able, and he is beloved in the Eastern Countries. The Men will now turn out. Morgans Corps, with some other Troops are sent up to check and chastise the inhuman Butchers of bloody Burgoyne. An affair has lately happened in that Quarter on the Mohock river that gives spirits to the people. Near Fort Stanwix a body of the enemy intending to beseige that place, were attackt by a party of Tryon County Militia under command of a General Hackerman. The General was wounded but bravely kept the ground & encouraged his men, several valuable gentlemen of that County were slain, but their enemies were totally defeated with great loss both of officers, men, & baggage. In the meantime the Commander of the Fort sallied out and did considerable execution upon 200 Regulars who made head against him. He brought off some artillery from the enemy, and a good deal of baggage.  I went the other day to see the Army, the main body of which is about 20 miles from this City. 2000 men are at Coryells ferry & Sullivan with 2000 more is placed at Morris Town. Old Putnam with 5000 occupies the heights of Peeks Kill on Hudsons river. This disposition was taken, to be in readiness to turn northward, or to defend this place, as Gen. Howes visit might render necessary. I think the Army is a gallant one,  well disciplined, clothed, armed (for they have all bayonets now) and sound in every respect-The Soldiers in good health and spirits, and every thing looks tout en Militaire. Among other curiosities there, I saw the young Marquis de la Fayette, a Nobleman of the first fortune and family in France, the favorite of Court and Country. He left behind him a most beautiful young wife, and all the soft enjoyments that such a situation, with an immense fortune in a polished Country can furnish to fight in American wilderness for American Liberty! After this can there be a Tory in the World? He has rank of Major General in the Continental Army & fights without pay. He is thirsty for glory but the Commissioners at Paris wish the General may restrain the arder of youth and not suffer his exposure but on some signal occasion. He is sensible, polite, and good natured. How this example ought to gall the worthless Nobility & Gentry of England, who meanly creap into the Tyrants service to destroy that liberty which a generous Frenchman quits every delight to defend thro every difficulty! Our intelligence from France is late in May, and tho we are not to expect immediate war in Europe, yet we shall assuredly receive substantial aid from thence. Both France & Spain are powerfully and rapidly arming, whilst the necessary attention to security agst such powerful neighbors, obliges England to incur great expences and prevents her efforts against us. The better opinion is, that the peace of Europe cannot continue a year. With their Fleet, the French spirit rises, for we yearn that when Lord Stormont lately said to the Minister of France \""The peace cannot long continue, if America continues to draw supplies from France,\"" he was answered \""Nous ne desiron pas la guerre, et nous ne le craignon pas.\"" The truth is, that both France & Spain are most heartily our friends and will give us every substantial aid, but directly going into the war, for which they are not yet ready. Dr. Price told a Gentleman in London the other day, that the Custom House books began to shew great deficiencies in point of duties, and a Ministerial Man said that nothing but the interposition of Providence could save G. Britain from destruction. But the Tyrant relies we hear, upon the desperate efforts that Howe and Cornwallis must make to redeem their \""Bankrupt Honor.\"" The Court of London, for purposes very obvious, encourages every kind of amusement and dissipation thro out England. By royal Authority Theatres are licenced in the formerly busy Manufacturing Towns of Birmingham, Sheffield &c &c.  Lord Chatham is not dead, as was reported, but lives with better health than usual. He has been figuring lately in the House of Lords, where he advised an immediate peace with America, on any terms; assuring his Hearers, they had no more chance to conquer this Continent with the Forces they had, or could get, than he would have to conquer England with his Crutch. He said they might create distress along the Sea Cost, and seize the Towns there, but the longer they carried on the war the greater would be their disgrace, and the more certain their   ruin. Good old Man. If Kings will be suffered in the World, why is it not insisted on that they shall attend to Wise and good counsellors!  I hope our friend Parker will soon be about salt making, and I further hope you will find time to assist him in the art of seperating and preparing the Purging Salt.  I have trespassed sufficiently on your time, and the little liesure that business allows me, begging therefore [my love?] to Doctor Steptoe I bid you heartily farewell, Richard Henry Lee  [P.S.] Poor Manly is certainly taken, and there is too much reason to fear the Fox is also retaken. They are yet much too powerful for us on the Sea. Manlys Frigate was very little superior in force to the Fox, but he made her strike. He could not immediately fight a 44 gun ship.

We have no Intelligence of Howe's Fleet. The Army we know for a Certainty is embarked. We begin to be apprehensive they have gone to South Carolina.  The Militia of Tryon County have had a very smart Engagement with Johnson & his Indians & a Body of British Troops. It is said the Militia consisted of 700. We lost about 100 men some of which are the most active leading Whigs in that County. The Enemy were defeated & lost fifty or sixty Indians and some of their best Officers. There was another Brush by a Party under Capt. Willet who drove another Party of the Enemy and took a considerable Booty. Genl. Schuyler writes that the van of Burgoyne's Army he is informed has moved forward to Saratoga. I wish our affairs in that Quarter bore a more pleasing Aspect. The New England States disgusted with Schuyler & his officers have been very slow in giving him Assistance. Gates perhaps will please them & get them to exert themselves.

  Philadelphia August 20th. 1777 My best Friend Wednesday This Day compleats three Years since I stepped into the Coach, at Mr. Cushings Door, in Boston, to go to Philadelphia in Quest of Adventures. And Adventures I have found. I feel an Inclination sometimes, to write the History of the last Three Years, in Imitation of Thucidides. There is a striking Resemblance, in several Particulars, between the Peloponnesian and the American War The real Motive to the former was a Jealousy of the growing Power of Athens, by Sea and Land. . .(1) The genuine Motive to the latter, was a similar Jealously of the growing Power of America. The true Causes which incite to War, are seldom professed, or Acknowledged.  We are now afloat upon a full Sea: When We shall arrive at a safe Harbour, no Mariner has Skill and experience enough to foretell. But, by the Favour of Heaven, We shall make a prosperous Voyage, after all the Storms, and Shoals are passed.  5. o Clock afternoon It is now fair sunshine again and very warm. Not a Word, yet, from Hows Fleet. The most general Suspicion, now, is that it is gone to Charlestown S.C. But it is a wild Supposition. It may be right however: for Howe is a wild General.  We have been hammering to day, upon a Mode of Tryal for the General Officers at Ti. Whether an Enquiry will preceed the Court Martial, and whether the Enquiry shall be made by a Committee of Congress or by a Council of General Officers, is not determined, but Enquiry and Tryal both I conjecture there will be.  If How is gone to Charlestown, you will have a little Quiet, and enjoy your Corn and Rye and Flax and Hay, and other good Things, untill another Summer.  But What shall We do for Sugar, and Wine and Rum? Why truly I believe We must leave them off. Loaf Sugar is only four Dollars a Pound here, and Brown only a Dollar, for the meanest sort, and Ten shillings for that a little better. Every Body here is leaving off loaf Sugar, and most are laying aside brown. As to Rum and Wine-give me Cyder and I would compound. N.E. Rum is but 40s. a Gallon. But, if AUGUST 20, 1777  Wine was Ten Dollars a Bottle, I would have one Glass a Day, in Water, while the hot weather continues, unless I could get Cyder.  ""

He had made an agreement with Mr Deane, but this he gave up by Letter to Congress, not wishing as he said to embarrass their affairs. Mr Duer who presented this Letter assur'd us he did not wish or desire Command, but gave us to understand his chief motive for going into our Service was to be near you, to see Service, and to give him an Eclat at home, where he expected he would soon return. These you may depend on it were the Reasons that induced Congress to Comply with his request, and that he could not have obtain'd the Commission on any other terms, The other Day he surprised every body by a letter of his, requesting Commissions for his officers, and Insinuating at the same time that he should expect a Command as soon as you should think him fit for one. Depend on it Congress never meant that he should have one, nor will not countenance him in his applications, I had it not in my power yesterday to get their opinions on the subject, but will do it soon.(1)  Where can Howe be gone.

At 9 o Clock at Night, on the 14 Inst. upwards of an hundred Sail were seen, standing in between the Capes of Cheasapeak Bay. They had been seen from the Eastern shore of Virginia, standing off, and on, for two days before. This Method of coasting along the shore, and standing off, and on, is very curious. First seen off Egg Harbour, then several Times off the Capes of Delaware, standing in and out, then off Sinepuxent, then off the Eastern shore of Virginia, then standing in to Cheasapeak Bay. How many Men, and Horses, will he loose in this Sea Ramble, in the Heat of Dog days. Whether he is going to Virginia to steal Tobacco, to N. Carolina to pilfer Pitch and Tar, or to South to plunder Rice and Indigo, who can tell? He will seduce a few Negroes from their Masters let him go to which he will. But is this conquering America?  From the Northward We learn that Arnold has marched with about 2000 Men to the Relief of Fort Schuyler.

  Sir, War Office Augt 21st. 1777 Col. Bland informed me that the Enemy had thrown into the Rariton on their Departure from Brunswick two Cannon, one of 32, the other of 24. If these Cannon could be raised & sent in to this Place they would be very useful in the Defence of the Chevaux de Frize as we have no spare Guns of that Weight of Ball. I mentioned this Matter to the Board who gave it in Direction to me to request your Excellency would order Search to be made after the Cannon & if practicable direct them to be raised out of the River & sent on to Philadelphia immediately. There are here about 20 Eighteen Pounders belonging to the State & the Board are collecting a Number of twelves which were intended for the Frigates, Monsr. Du Coudray's Plan requiring a vast Number of Guns. But whether twelve Pdrs. will answer much Purpose or whether it will be prudent to trust any great Number of Cannon on the Jersey Side where it seems a great Proportion of them are to go, are Matters which future Events will determine; at present they are at least doubtful.(1) I have the Honour to be, with the greatest Esteem & Respect, your very obed hble Servt, Richard Peters Secy  [P.S.] There are here two Frigates without Guns. Query would it not be better to make Batteries of these & put the Guns except a few at Billinsport & Red Bank on Board them as they could be moved off in Case of Accident, than to trust them where they must be lost if the Enemy prevail on the East Side of Delaware?

  Dear Sir 21st August 1777 I have by this Conveyance per Capt Hornby troubled you with two or three packets already. My Heart is now Swelled with alarming  AUGUST 21, 1777  apprehensions for my Country & my friends. I feel for all without distinction even for Some whose envy has made them often very unfriendly to me. I have long viewed Carolina as a fair bait for the Enemy-unguarded & even inviting. At length by false policy we have compelled them to take the most valuable jewel in the American Crown & to ruin our United Cause, for in the capture of Charles Town I see the destruction of the confederacy. God grant my feelings may upon the present occasion be without cause, I take it for granted the British Armament which lately disappeared from the Coast of Maryland is gone to So Carolina & Georgia in order to destroy our Trade, to make immense plunder of Negroes & perhaps Rice & Indigo & if we suffer them, to supply the West India Trade with Lumber & provision. In this view can I forbear grief ?  You may remark from my direction to Loveday to make a clean House, that I had always lively apprehensions of our danger, & upon the first intimation of a fleet from New York I urged my Colleagues partly from common maxims of policy to Sound the Alarm to our Constituents by an express notification that 250 Sail of Ships with 7000 Men well appointed were in motion, but they judged it unnecessary-but I had Stronger motives for giving the information. I knew the value of my Country to ourselves & to the Enemy. I knew they only wanted to be rightly informed to induce them to attempt it. I knew that we had unfortunately sent persons to them who could give them the best information. I knew they had among them an enterprizing Genius whose ambition & avarice would prompt him to use every artifice, every means in his power to gain a Command upon an expedition which held out to him Glory & Rich pillage. If the Enemy are gone to you, my old frien Grant(1) will be the first or second in Command & will have the merit of having been the projector.  This Morning I will move Congress to believe the danger real & to take some measure to hem the assailants within a narrow Circle if unhappily they Should get footing.(2) I have Strongly pressed Colo. Horry & Colo. Pinckney to fly homeward, they will go next Monday.  I send inclosed Copy of a Letter from a Gentleman of Rank to his friend here, it gives a melancholly true picture of our late affairs in the Northern department. Shew it to the president. If it meets you in the Woods it will rather mortify than console but we ought to know the truth. I pray God protect you all, you & yours in particular.  22d & 23d.

  Sir Philada. Augst. 21st. 1777 This gratefully acknowledges the receipt of yr. favour of the 31st Ulto. from Litchfield. The probable \""slow pilgrimage\"" of every written testimony of my esteem towards you makes it useless to endeavour to convey any novelty respecting matters to the east & north of my present situation; and the known simularity of our ideas of the leaders old and new in the FATAL DEPARTMENT annuls every call for my comments or reflexions upon their conduct. If the final decision in regard to Arnold's claim should draw any strictures from you, I shall not be backward to answer them in turn. It may be fresh to you that Genl. Starks from N Hampshire refuses to act with continental troops but upon his own terms; I believe the state gave some option whether to join the regular army or not; all, beyond that, is his own freak.(1)  We think we have reason to conclude that Howe is gone to surprize the Ports in North and South Carolina & Georgia. That he means to garison the places proper; to block the harbours, & to return to this or N. Yk. In the mean time our main strength will lay midway, instead of reinforcing Gates & Putnam to destroy Bourgoin & the last mentioned Capital; which are easy conquests in the absence of Genl. Howe's body of forces.  As to indoor matters they are like unto like. Our agents will pay the interest of our borrowings at the Loan Offices for 5,000,000 Dollars or more. Some of us therefore think that, by informing the public they shall either receive 6 per Cent here, or bills of Exchange upon our Commissioners at 5, mercantile men would be induced to lend. Others are for making new tickets carrying upon their face 5 per Cent in France so as to make them negotiable, supposing they would be bought abroad at par on a small discount. But even if this was probable, which it is not in my opinion, the consequence would be giving foreigners a demand upon us at some certain future Period for millions. These we could not oblidge like our own people to wait till we could sink our tickets by taxes in a course of years. You will guess who are for turning things into rapid mercantile courses with a motto of the devil take the hindmost. In both schemes attention is paid to present exigencies; for, Taxes are indubitably our only wise Plan for a continuance; and every day we omit to tax  AUGUST 22, 1777  we pass a precious opportunity. One of the schemes is built upon certainty; the other upon chance with the highest probability of ill consequences. The principal of the Tickets is to be paid here upon our plighted faith. If they do not obtain currency in Europe we shall be disgraced immediately; for, the face of the Paper shows our views & expectations. If they do pass freely, we shall have a sad after-reconing. If fresh encouragement to lenders, by bills of Exchange for their interest as it becomes due, does not give an immediate spring to our Loan business, we must emit directly, till a tax can supply. We should consider that we have only gone two years into our annual income; we can bear much more; and our circulation is most amazingly extended, so as not to leave the depreciation a charge against the quantity of Bills, by any means so strong as the prevalent opinion. Other causes have a more powerful influence. If Silas (2) and his York connexions could have a good opening to transfer their whole property to the other side of the water it is not impossible that they would gladly do it.  Sir 22d Augst Since scratching an attendant half Sheet we have had several sorts of intelligence that may produce changes very considerable in our domestic plans. In the first place there has been a proper council of war and determination as things then stood. We have in the next place information that on the 15th the Enemy's fleet was at the Capes of Virginia. The Genl. & Council had thought 5th. Carolina or the eastern States the Object of Howe's pursuit.(3) I still believe that Virginia is visited thro meer necessity, if the present appearance of the ships is any thing more than an allarrn. On the 5th of July the Troops went on board; they sail'd from Sandy Hook the 23d, appeared at the mouth of the Delaware the 31st, at Sinepuxent the 8th of Augst. and within the Capes of Virginia the 15th. It was said they had 40 days forrage on board, which must now be expended. Suppose Virginia is to be ravaged in part, some negroes and tobacco stolen, and a few stragling houses burnt; this is not forrage, or that conquest of America which is desired by Britain. It will furnish the Soldiery with plunder and revive their spirits a little. In the mean time, _____ Bu t, I leave that matter to futurity.  Starks & his militia have made even Genl. Chase willing to overlook a foolish rashness about rank. The Bennington affair may spur up to general vigour in the northern Department. Schyler has been petitioned by the Genl. Officers to tarry & influence the militia, and he has consented to do it. If he is not a valliant man, he certainly knows how to use the world; he is far from a foolish man. He advises to send other indian Commissioners because Mr. Woolcot &c. are so far off. I will give you the extract. This also is not f oolish.  4. Clock P.M.  Yesterday & this day we adjourned to dine. We were particularly   induced to it, now, by an Express declaring the fleet high in the Bay of Chesepeak.(4) It appears we must at length fight it between Head of Elk and Philadelphia.(5)  ""

  Sir Philadelphia Agust 22d. 1777. The Inclosed is a coppy of general Lincolns letter to general Schyler and the Resolution of Congress on Receiving it, which was the l9th Insant.(1) Some of the Southern gentlemen made themselves Very warme on the occation, threw out many Illiberal Reflections on general Stark, and some on the legisltive authority of the state of New Hampshire which made your deligates sit very uneasy in thair chairs even to give them time to go through, but in our turn we informed Congress that we had no information from the State of Newhampshire to informe us what the Resons waire that induced them to give such orders to general Stark, but that we had Recd. a letter from the Honel. Josiah Bartlet a member of the council of that State and lately a member of congress which had given us some of thaire Reisons and ware such in ouer opinion as ware concluscive and would justify the conduct of that state in the eyes of the whol world. That in the first Place the militia of that State had lost all confidence in the general officers who had the comand at Tyconderoga when it was evacuated and given up to our enemies. That they would not turn out nor be commanded by  AUGUST 22, 1777  such officers. That the Preservation of the lives of the inhabetints on ouer frunteers and the cause in which we weire all engaged mad Such orders at that critical time absolutely necessary. That we ware not abought to justify general Stark for making a demand of Rank in the army at that Critical time but we well know that he hase a great deal to Say for him salf on that head, and that he had been in allmost all of the engagements to the northward and distinguished him Self while others ware advanced [over?] his head. Yesterday a motion wase made by Maryland and seconded that a Resolve of Congress might be Paste to Censure his Conduct in Refuseing to submit to the Rules & Regulations of the armay on which a large debate insued in which we ware Suported by all the Newengland Delegates and some of the Verginians. On motion being made it was agreed it Should lie on the table and carried by a grate majority.(2) We informd Congress that a motion of that Sort came with a Very bad grace from Maryland who only of the thirteen United States had Seen fit to make laws Diracktly in oppersion to Congress, by Refuseing that thaire militia Should be Subjacted to the Rules and Ragulation of the army when Joynd. And we informd Congress that we had not the lest Doubt but the first batle thay heard of from the north would be faught by Stark and the troops he Comanded, notwithstanding that Some gentleman in thaire warmthe had Said Some things Disrespectfull of them and that I Should not be affraid to Risk my honer nor my Life thay wood do as much towards the defence of that Part of the Cuntrey and the Coman Cause as the Same number of any of the troops in that department. I will leve you Sr. to Judge of ouer feelings when the Very naxt day we had a Conformation of what we had asserted by an Express from general Schuyler Giveing an account of the Victory obtained by general Stark and the troops under his Command. We beleive this Curcumstance only will make those Easy who have been trying to Rase a dust in Congress. We have this day an account by express from Maryland of the arivel of a hundred Saile of Hows fleet in Chesepeek bay and a hundd. moore turneing into Said bay. It is the opinion of Congress thaire design is to attack this City as it is but abought fifty miles a Cross from whare thair Ships are at anchor to this Place. General Washington is incampt abought thirty miles to the northward of this Place with abought half of his army the Rest Chefly on Hudsons River. The above information no Doubt will turne his attenshon this way. As the enemy are within two Days march of this Place orders are given to the Inhabetents to drive back thaire Stock that they may not fall in to the enemys hands. General Gates Reacht Albany the 1 7th Instant in order to take the Command in that department. The Congress are not in the lest discoraged and have not the lest doubt but ouer effairs will bare a more favourable aspect in the north and had rather How should  come to this Place than anywhare else as general Washington is so handy.

  Honor. Gentlemen, Philad. 22d August, 1777. Your despatches of the 15th instant we had the honour of receiving, with so minute an account of the situation of our distressed country, and your efforts for its preservation, as you have been pleased to furnish.(1) We left nothing undone to procure the reinforcements which were in our opinion indispensably necessary for your safety. Van Cortlandt's and Livingston's battalions will be a seasonable relief, but Col. Morgan's corps of riflemen will, we flatter ourselves, be of decisive advantages.  The battles in Tryon county and at Bennington, so favourable to our affairs at the most critical juncture, will undoubtedly raise the spirits of our fellow citizens; and as New-Jersey is called upon for 1,000 men to garrison forts in the Highlands, with an express design to give the militia of our State an opportunity of repairing to the northern frontier and reinforcing the army there,(2) It is to be hoped General Burgoyne will meet with an effectual check, if not a total defeat.  General Howe's fleet were seen the 14th instant plying off the Capes of Virginia; what are his real intentions still remains an uncertainty. South Carolina is the only object worth his pursuit; but against such an enterprise the season seems to be an insurmountable obstacle. Should this however be the case, the army must look to the northward, for vain will it be to attempt to follow General Howe through the distant and unhealthy climes of the southern States, from which he can vanish at pleasure AUGUST 22,1777  Photographic Reproduction of Bennington Broadside, August 18-22, 1777 AUGUST 22, 1777  We have the honour to be, with the utmost respect, honor. gentlemen, Your most obedient and very hum. servants, Jas. Duane,  Wm. Duer.  P.S. Since writing what precedes, an express is arrived from Baltimore, giving us a certain account that the enemy's fleet have entered Chesapeek's Bay, and yesterday morning were near its head; their army by this time is probably landed. General Washington, with the American troops, lies about 20 miles from this city, and we presume will immediately move to the southward and attack the enemy, to whom he is probably superior in numbers, independent of the militia.

  My best Friend Philadelphia August 23 1777  It is now no longer a Secret, where Mr. Hows Fleet is. We have authentic Intelligence that it is arrived, at the Head of Cheasopeak Bay, above the River Petapsco upon which the Town of Baltimore stands.  I wish I could describe to you the Geography of this Country, so as to give you an Adequate Idea of the Situation of the two great Bays of Cheasopeak and Delaware, because it would enable you to form a Conjecture, concerning the Object, he aims at. The Distance across Land from the Heads of these Bays is but small, and forms an Istmus, below which is a large Peninsula comprehending the Counties of Accomack and Northampton in Virginia, the Counties of Somersett and Worcester in Maryland, and the Counties of Kent and Sussex on Delaware. His March by Land to Philadelphia, may be about sixty or seventy Miles. I think there can be no doubt that he aims at this Place, and he has taken this Voyage of six Weeks, long enough to have gone to London, merely to avoid an Army in his Rear. He found he could not march this Way from Somersett Court House, without leaving G. Washington in his Rear.  We have called out the Militia of Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, and Pensilvania, to oppose him, and G. Washington is handy enough, to meet him, and as G. Washington saved Philadelphia last Winter, by crossing the Delaware and marching to Morristown, and so getting in the Rear of Howe, so I conjecture he will still find Means to get in his Rear between him and Chesapeak Bay.  AUGUST 23, 1777  You may now sit under your own Vine, and have none to make you afraid. I sent off my Man and Horse at an unlucky Time, but, if We should be obliged to remove from hence, We shall not go far.  If Congress had deliberated and debated a Month they could not have concerted a Plan for Mr. Howe more to our Advantage than that which he has adopted. He gives Us an Opportunity of exerting the Strength of all the middle States against him, while N.Y. and N.E. are destroying Burgoine. Now is the Time, never was so good an Opportunity, for my Countrymen to turn out and crush that vapouring, blustering Bully to Attoms.  ""

Nicholson and several other Gentlemen with an Account that the Fleet, to the Number of Two hundred and Sixty Three Sail, have gone up towards the Head of Chesapeak Bay. They lie over against the Shore between the River Sassafras and the River Elke.  We have also a Letter from General Washington acquainting Us that Tommorrow Morning at seven O Clock, he shall march his Army through the City of Philadelphia, along Front Street, and then turn up Chesnutt Street, in his Way to cross over the Bridge at Schuylkill River, so that General How will have a grand Continental Army, to oppose him, in very good Season, aided by a formidable Collection of Militia.  I like this Movement of the General, through the City, because, such a show of Artillery, Waggons, Light Horse and Infantry, which takes up a Line of 9 or 10 Miles upon their March and will not be less than 5 or 6 Hours passing through the Town, will make a good Impression upon the Minds of the timourous Whiggs for their Confirmation, upon the cunning Quakers for their Restraint and upon the rascally Tories for their Confusion.  I think there is a reasonable Ground for Confidence with the Favour of Heaven that How will not be able to reach this City. Yet I really doubt whether it would not be more for our Interest that he should come here and get Possession of the Town.  1. Because there are Impurities here which will never be so soon or so fully purged away, as by that Fire of Affliction which How inkindles wherever he goes. AUGUST 23, 1777  2. Because it would employ nearly the whole of his Force to keep Possession of this Town, and the rest of the Continent would be more at Liberty.  3. We could counteract him here better than in many other Places.  4. He would leave N. England and N.Y. at Leisure to kill or catch Burgoine.  In all Events I think you may rejoice and sing, for the season is so far gone, that he cannot remove to you.  ""

  My Dear Sir Philada. Augst. 23rd. 1777. I received your Letter of the 17th by Thursdays Post. Yesterday Noon I received an Express from Mr. W. Bordley, informing that the fleet were off Rock Hall. The Intelligence was immediately communicated to his Excellency Gen. Washington, by whose Answer, received last Night, we are informed that he has ordered the Division under Gen. Nash, about 1500 & 300 artillery at Trenton, to march directly to Chester; that Sullivanes Division, now at Morris Town are also ordered down & the Army under his Command, at Nashameny, about 20 Miles from this, are to march this Morning.  You will receive, by Express, a Requisition to call out 1250 of the western, and 750 of the Eastern Shore Militia. They are desired to collect at Baltimore & Harford & George Town on Sassafras. Virginia is desired to march from her back Counties about 2000 to Frederick Town. The Intention is to cover our Country from the Incursions & Depredations of the Enemy, & to hang on the Rear of the Enemy. Gen. Washington never intends to join our or any Militia with his Regulars, but in Case of an absolute Necessity. Orders are sent to remove the prisoners and Stores from Lancaster, to prevent their Loss by a Coup de Main of Gen. Howe. This City is certainly the great object of Gen. Howe, & I believe he will not only be disappointed in that Design, but totally ruined, if the Militia turn out.  I greatly lament your Want of Arms. I hope you will be able in a little Time to render those lately arrived, fit for Use.  Genl. Smallwood & Colo.

  My dear General Philad 23d Augt 1777 I am now to thank you for your kind and confidential favour of the Instt.(1)  With the papers transmitted me by Mr Jay they have and shall be seen by those whose good opinion deserve your Solicitude.  Your Conduct in my Judgement wants no Apology. Instead of Censure it merits thanks. Your Friends in Congress echo this Sentiment freely. Your Enemies relentless and bent on your Destruction woud willingly involve you in the Odium of loosing Ticonderoga. The Change of Command was not however founded on this principle but merely on the Representation of the Eastern States that their militia suspicious of your military Character woud not turn out in Defence of New York while you presided in the Northern Department. So Confident were they in these Assertions and such from your Own representations was the gloomy Aspect of our Affairs there, that the Southern members were alarmed, and we thought it prudent not to attempt to Stem the Torrent. It was however agreed and declard, as I hinted before, that the Eastern prejudices against you were the only motive to your recall, and it was understood that you might take your time in coming down. Indeed to have ordered otherwise, at so critical a Time, wou'd have been inhuman considering your family, fortune and Influence in that Country. Your Resolution to stay & exert yourself while she remains in such imminent danger is worthy of a Virtuous, brave and patriotic Citizen. All your Friends wish that fortune may put it in your power to give some signal Proof of the only military Talent which you have not Evidenced in the Course of your Command for want of an Opportunity. They all pronounce that this woud put your Enemies to Silence and to Shame and elevate you to the highest Rank among the American Commanders.  The Application from the Eastern Generals for your Continuance in the Department, and the respectable Reinforcement from New Hampshire which so palpably contradict the Assertions which were the Basis of your Removal are no small Occasion of Triumph to such of us as predicted that you woud be supported, and will not readily be AUGUST 23, 1777  forgotten. Probably a few weeks will give a decisive and fortunate turn to our Affairs in the North. The Loss already sustaind by the Enemy must be severely felt, and Mr Burgoine's Temerity cannot fail of exposing him to inextricable Embarrasment.

Stark has in some measure retrieved our Affairs in the Northern Department. He is a Militia Brigadier from N Hampshire & has acquired great Honor. The fleet of the Enemy are arrived in Chesapeke Bay, what may be their Intensions Congress is not informed, but are prepared, I hope, to disconcert their Plan whichever way it may be pointed. As Congress seem at present Inclinable to fortify Sea Ports at the Continental Expence, I could wish Your Excellency would be pleased to forward to the Delegates of your State, the Plans of Cape Lookout Bay and C Fear River. I hope for the Assistance of Congress in this business, I have, ever since I arrived in this City, proposed to my Collegues to write Official Letters Jointly, this has not as yet been thought necessary, I only therefore can Lay before your Excy. my own Crude & Indigested thoughts on Subjects as they Occur to me.  Would it not be adviseable to Collect the Arms Drop'd by our Battalions in Virginia & Maryland, perhaps an Application to the Governors of those States would Effect this purpose, bad as those Arms are, they are better than none.

  My dearest Friend Philadelphia August 24. 1777 We had last Evening a Thunder Gust, very sharp and violent, attended with plentifull Rain. The Lightning struck in several Places. It struck the Quaker Alms House in Walnut Street, between third and fourth Streets, not far from Captn. Duncans, where I lodge. They had been wise enough to place an Iron Rod upon the Top of the Steeple, for a Vane to turn on, and had provided no Conductor to the Ground. It also struck in fourth Street, near Mrs. Cheesmans. No Person was hurt.  This Morning was fair, but now it is overcast and rains very hard which will spoil our Show, and wett the Army.  12. O Clock. The Rain ceased and the Army marched through the Town, between Seven and Ten O Clock. The Waggons went another Road. Four Regiments of Light Horse-Blands, Bailers, Sheldons, and Moylands. Four Grand Divisions of the Army-and the Artillery with the Matrosses. They marched Twelve deep, and yet took up above two Hours in passing by.  General Washington and the other General Officers, with their Aids on Horse back. The Colonels and other Field Officers on Horse back.  We have now an Army, well appointed between Us and Mr. Howe, and this Army will be immediately joined, by ten Thousand Militia. So that I feel as secure here, as if I was at Braintree, but not so happy. My Happiness is no where to be found, but there.  After viewing this fine Spectacle and firm Defense I went to Mr. Duffields Meeting, to hear him pray, as he did most fervently, and I believe he was very sincerely joined by all present, for its success.  AUGUST 24, 1777  The Army, upon an accurate Inspection of it, I find to be extreamly well armed, pretty well cloathed, and tolerably disciplined. Gill and Town by the Mottoes to their Newspapers, will bring Discipline into Vogue, in Time.(1) There is such a Mixture of the Sublime, and the Beautifull, together with the Usefull, in military Discipline, that I wonder, every Officer We have is not charmed with it. Much remains yet to be done. Our soldiers have not yet, quite the Air of Soldiers. They dont step exactly in Time. They dont hold up their Heads, quite erect, nor turn out their Toes, so exactly as they ought. They dont all of them cock their Hats-and such as do, dont all wear them the same Way.  A Disciplinarian has affixed to him commonly the Ideas of Cruelty, severity, Tyranny &c. But if I were an Officer I am convinced I should be the most decisive Disciplinarian in the Army. I am convinced their is no other effectual Way of indulging Benevolence, Humanity, and the tender Social Passions, in an Army. There is no other Way of preserving the Health and Spirits of the Men. There is no other Way of making them active, and skillfull, in War-no other Method of guarding an Army against Destruction by surprizes, and no other Method of giving them Confidence in one another, or making them stand by one another, in the Hour of Battle.  Discipline in an Army, is like the Laws, in civil Society.  There can be no Liberty, in a Commonwealth, where the Laws are not revered, and most sacredly observed, nor can there be Happiness or Safety in an Army, for a single Hour, where the Discipline is not observed.  Obedience is the only Thing wanting now for our Salvation-Obedience to the Laws, in the States, and Obedience to Officers, in the Army.  12 O Clock. No Express, nor accidental News from Maryland to day, as yet.  ""

  Honored Sir, Philadelphia August 24th. 1777 I have by no Means been unmindful of the unhappy Situation of the State of Rhode Island. A very large Body of the Enemy long since took Possession of near a quarter Part of that State, and altho' the Enemy have called off from Time to Time great Part of Their Forces there, yet Their having gained a Possession, aided still by Their Ships; the Force of the State with the small Aid received from Our Sister States have not yet enabled Us to dislodge the Enemy. In the mean Time, the whole Trade and Commerce of the State, as well as the Continental Ships have been blocked up. Taking into Consideration that the Enemy have seen proper to make this Campaign so far to the Southward and Northward as I am in Hopes will give an Opportunity to raise a sufficient Force of Militia and State Battallions to induce Our State joined by Massts and Connecticut to make an Attempt upon Rhode-Island: And in Order to give a Spring to such a hoped for Design; and wishing at least to get Our Shipping and Continental  AUGUST 24, 1777  Navy out to Sea, I ventured to draw up the enclosed Resolutions and to prefer Them to Congress. They were by Congress referred to the Marine Committee, and obtaining a favourable Report from that Board, I finally got Them passed by Congress nearly as I had at first drawn them up.(1) If they should be thought by the Navy Board for the Eastern Department and the Councill of War of Our State, to have been idle, inexpedient or unadviseable, I shall but have lost my Pains, not doubting but they will be candidly considered. If on the other Hand, they should meet the Approbation of the State I have the Honor to represent, I shall feel myself amply rewarded. And should They prove effecatious in delivering Our Trade and Commerce and the Continental Navy from its present Embarassments my every Wish will be unspeakably gratified. I thought I could not well answer it to the distressed State of Rhode-Island &c to remain an Idle Spectator of the Calamities to which it has been reduced without receiving any Continental Aid, while so many Thousands have been expended in the particular Defense of Delaware Bay and River; not less than ten Fire Ships, besides several large Gallies having been ordered by Congress, exclusive of very great Continental Assistance in constructing and raising of Batteries &c &c. I would by no Means however wish to see the publick Monies expended in Our State, without a hopeful Prospect of its being really beneficial. And I would therefore strongly recommend that it be first well considered. I doubt not you will have the same Resolves inclosed to you by the President; but I have hitherto made it my Duty to transmit you all Resolves that respect Our State. I could wish the Hints I offered some Time past, of sending out two armed Briggs on a Cruize, and to France for Cloathing &c four Our Soldiery, may be thought worthy of Attention; especially if Our Harbour should be opened.  Just as Congress as well as Genl. Washington had concluded, Mr. How had most certainly sailed for South Carolina, and an Expedition was forming four Our Army, and some of Them had began to move again Eastward, An Express denounced Mr. How's Appearance with a Fleet of 260 Sail almost up to the Head of Cheaspeak Bay, Genl. Washington immediately ordered his Army to march this Way. The main Body of His Army this Morning passed thro' this City. From the State House We had a fair View of Them as They passed in Their several Divisions. The Army alone with the necessary Cannon and Artillery for each Division, exclusive of their Baggage Waggons, Guards &c which took another Rout, were upwards of two Hours in passing with a lively smart Step.  I congratulate your Honor upon the Victory obtained by Genl. Stark, Genl. Harkimer, and by Col. Witlet. These are happy Presages I hope of future Success.  It is just reported that How has begun a landing about seven Miles below the Head of Elk. We have also a Report of a Skirmish upon Staten Island, terminating to Our Advantage; but have not the Particulars. With great Respect I am, Honored Sir, your most Obedient, humble Servant, Hy.

  My Dear Sir. Philada. Augst. 25, 1777. Monday Evening. I am favoured with your Letter of last Fryday by this Days Post. Your Expresses arrived here Saturday afternoon. Eer this an Express to you must be arrived. I wrote You this Day, that we were informed by a Letter from Hollingsworth of yesterday that 200 Sail were lying between Turky Point & Sassafras River, & that on Saturday Evening not one Person had landed. Troops are undoubtedly on board. Gen. Washington marched at the Head of his army, between 8 & 9000, thro' this City yesterday Morning. Genl. Nashes Brigade of N. Carolina forces between 12 & 1500 passed thro' this Morning. Genl. Sullivane will be here in three or four Days.  I must approve your Proclamation for Calling forth the Militia, and am glad the Wish and Intentions of Congress and Gen. Washington so exactly correspond with yours. I beleive Gen. Washington will be posted on the Heights before Howe can land & march there. It will greatly assist Us to be in Possession.  I am satisfied neither Annapolis or Baltimore can, at present, be defended against any considerable Sea or Land force, and yet I would AUGUST 25, 1777  by no Means have them abandoned, especially the latter I am convinced Mr. Howe will be fully employed, and can spare no Land force against either, if he means to prosecute any attempt against this City. If I may be permitted to suggest my opinion, I would endeavor to obstruct the Passage between Queenbury and Horn Points, and would keep the Gallies & Xebeck in the Harbour, put the Forts in the best Condition, & keep 200 Militia in the City. I would give considerable attention to Baltimore. I would compleat the present works, erect new temporary works on some advantageous place between the Town & Pataspsco River, capable of being defended by 500 but capable of Holding 1000 Men, & I would station 500 Militia in Baltimore. In that Situation neither could be taken or destroyed without a Landforce that Howe cannot spare. It is probable if Mr. Howe should fail in or decline his Design on this City, or be beaten, he will make an Attempt to possess himself of one or both of those Places for his Winter Quarters. If you could only delay him a few Days, our Army would follow him. Expence must be incurred & some Danger risked. I am very unwilling to lose our only trading Towns. Be assured that a few fire-Rafts, procurred at a little Expence, will greatly terrify the Enemy. Gen. Washington will consider of sending you an Engineer.  I think you perfectly right to remove the public Stores & Money, but I hope You will consider well before You dismantle the fortifications.  This Moment, while writing, Colo. Hazen showed Me a Letter, giving an account of an attempt by Gen. Sullivane on the Enemy on Staten Island last Thursday. One party under Colo. Ogden of 500, surprised the Enemy, killed a few, made 100 prisoners & returned. Sullivane commanded Deborres Brigade, he killed 5 & made 30 prisoners. Gen. Smallwood had no Luck. He was discovered & the Enemy escaped. So far Success. About 9 o'Clock the two Brigades joined, & began to cross at the old blazing Starr. Before all our Men got over, the Enemy came up & attacked 150 of our Men. Our People behaved bravely, drove the Enemy several Times, but were overpowered. We had but a few killed. We lost 130 privates prisoners. Colo. Antill, Major Woodson, Major Stewart, Major Tillard, Capt. Carlisle, & Duffee a Surgeons Mate are taken. Capt. Hoven, Lieut. Campbell, Lt. Anderson & Ensign Lee were not mentioned in the flagg & are suffered to be killed. Several Field & Commd. officers fell into our Hands. The above is the substance of the Letter.(1)  If Howe should issue a proclamation I wish You would answer it by another. Their perfidy to, and Robbery & Murders of those who were so credulous as to trust them would be excellent Subjects. Our press should rouse our People. I am convinced in no Manner can our Friend Mr Carroll so effectually serve his Country as by publishing a weekly Paper.   Our affairs look very favourably in the North. Farewell, tis now almost 12 oClock. If any thing ocurs tomorrow before the post leaves this I will write again. I expect Mr Paca here tomorrow with his Lady.  Your affectionate Friend and Obedt.

 Connecticut Delegates to Jonathan Trumbull, Sr.  Sir Philadelphia August the 25th. 1777 Since ours of last Monday when it was apprehended Genll. How was gone for South Carolina he has appeard with his whole fleet as it is supposed entering Cheesepeek Bay & by the last Accounts was up as far as where the river Elk enters the Bay. It is Conjectured he Intends landing at a place called Charlestown, from whence it is probable his first design may be upon Lancaster where we have large Stores & some hundreds of Prisoners. On Notice of the fleet coming up the Bay Immediate Orders were sent to Lancaster to remove the Stores & Prisoners from thence to some place of Safety but Philadelphia may yet be his principal Object as he will have but about fifty miles March to this place. If this is his design the only reason of his Changing Delaware for Cheesepeek must be the Concern he had of the Fire ships & rafts of which we had large Numbers in this river. Genll Washington with his Army had lain about 20 miles from this City towards the Jerseys untill Thursay last when Supposing Genll Howe to have gone far Southward beyond his reach had determined to push up the North River & Indeavour A total rout of the Enemy Northward if possible, at the same time to have attempted dislodging the Enemy from New York & have drove them in their detached parts from all their posts in the Northern & Eastern Department. Providence seemed to point out this season when How was at so great a distance, to Accomplish all this before his return but having that day received Intelligence of the Fleet pushing up Chesepeek altered his rout & is now on his March to Meet the Enemy wherever he may find them on this side Cheesepeek. He marched thro this City yesterday morning about 8 oClock with his whole Army which made a very respectable appearance. The Militia from this State, Delaware, Maryland & the nearest Countys in Virginia are ordered to join him. It is rather thought that Genll Washingtons forwardness to meet him in this quarter & especially if the Militia join him as is expected will again discourage Hows attempts this way but if not have the greatest hopes with the blessing of Heaven that here he may receive his final Overthrow. And we are yet in hopes Notwithstanding Genll Washingtons being Diverted from the Northward And Eastward Yet if New England (on the present divided State of How  AUGUST 25, 1777  & Burgoins Army) will properly exert themselves And rightly Improve the Advantages put into their hands they may by the blessing of Heaven Effect a most happy close to the present warr before this Year expires. We hope Burgoins Success (however blame worthy the Genll officers in that quarter may have been) will by the disposals of Providence prove his ruin & destruction. Congress have done what lay in their power to remove the Complaints of the People, recalled the Officers concernd, ordered the Strictest Scrutiny & are making every preparation for a full, fair & Impartial Tryal. They have sent such Officers to Command in their room in that Department as they thot most Acceptable to the people & in whom they might confide both for skill & fidelity, that we shall have no excuse for ourselves or the people whom we represent if they should now fail to offer themselves readily & Chearfully in the Cause of their bleeding Country. We hope, we trust, they will no longer drouse or Sleep untill the Tommohawk awake them in their own dwellings & habitations. The Notable Affair of Genll Stark with his party, seems to open a happy prospect of future success in that quarter if properly followd & pursued which God grant. This, with the Success of Coll Herkemer & Willet near Fort Stanwix & the distruction of so large a Number of the Savages at their first onset are most seasonable Interpositions of Providence in our behalf when every thing looked gloomy in that quarter. The great & weighty affair of our Confederacy, the Supplies of our Treasury giving Credit & Stability to our depreciating Currency are Objects which we trust will very soon be attended to, tho we have been unhappily diverted therefrom by other matters tho not so Important yet Necessary to be done.

Since you left Kingston the Council of Safety have been pleasd to resume their former Correspondence with us, which is the Reason you have been so long without an Answer; as we concluded our Letters to that honourable Body would be presented to you with the first Opportunity.  We have the Satisfaction of finding a perfect Correspondence between your Excellency's and our Sentiments on the Subject of the Northern Department; and can bear our Testimony That General Schuyler is sacrificd to unworthy Suspicion and unprovoked malice: and our State left to struggle almost alone under a powerful Invasion attended with every Circumstance of savage Barbarity and Devastation. The Change of our Affairs will have some Tendency (but much greater the Strange plan which general Howe is pursuing) to call forth our Massachusetts & Connecticut Neighbours into Action. Besides, as their favourite (1) commands they will be destitute of the Shadow of an Excuse if they do not Join the Army with the utmost Diligence and Alacrity. With the brave New Hampshire Militia, Morgan's, Livingston's & Van Cortlandt's Corps, joined to our own militia, I cannot but think, Heaven not being unpropitious, that General Burgoine will be obliged to consult his Safety by a precipitate Retreat. Perhaps, from his great Confidence, even that may become impracticable.  General Howe is now between Turkey point and Charles Town near the Head of Chesapeak bay. We have not learned that he has yet landed his army: but expect the news every Hour. General Washington marched part of his Army thro this City yesterday morning. Other Divisions will soon follow with a considerable body of militia. General Howe will therefore meet with a very warm Opposition. The Spirits of the People here are high. They have had time to regulate their militia and We have Reason to think they will turn out Very chearfully.

  Dear Sir Phila.

Since the loss of Ticonderoga (into the cause of which, and the conduct of the commanding Officers, Congress have ordered inquiry to be made) and Gen. Burgoynes speedy march to Fort Edward, our affairs in that quarter begin to wear a favorable appearance. In addition to Burgoynes force, another Body of Men came down the Mohock river, by way of Oswego, and laid seige to Fort Stanwix, or Schuyler, as it is now called. At this place a battle ensued with the Tryon County Militia, in which the enemy were driven from the ground with the loss of more than 200 Indians and several regulars Colo. Willet making a Sally from the Fort did great injury to the enemy and took from them a great quantity of baggage with 2 or 3 field pieces. However, the Militia having lost many Men in this Action and their best officers having been killed or wounded, they retired and left the enemy to return and lay Seige to Fort Schuyler, which the Garrison was bravely defending, when Gen. Arnold was detatched with a body of men to relieve the place. We expect every day to hear of his success. To the northward of this, in the N. Hampshire grants, Gen. Stark with 2000 Militia attacked Colo. Baum and 1500 Regular Troops behind works, and with Cannon. The consequence you will find in the inclosed Hand bill.(1) This was an important victory, well timed, and will probably occasion Mr Burgoyne to retire very quickly. If he does not, I can venture to Augur his destruction. He is at Saratoga and Fort Edward, with our main Army a few miles in his Front at the mouth of Mohock river. I expect Generals Lincoln and Arnold will presently be in his rear, after which, his chance of returning will be very small. Gen. Gates has joined the Northern Army and now commands in that quarter. Putnam with 5000 men commands on the heights of Hudsons river above N. York, in which place Gen. Clinton is left with about 3000 men. After Gen. Howe had long raised the curiosity of this part of the world, to know what could be his view in embarking his Army and coasting it for 5 weeks in a most oppressively hot season; at length,  AUGUST 25, 1777  he appears at the very head of Chesapeake Bay where he remains with more than 200 sail of Vessels His Troops not yet landed that we know of, but imagine they were put on shore yesterday. We are left yet to guess his Object. It may be supposed either for this City, or to conduct a line from Chesapeake to Newcastle and thereby inclose a large tract of Country between that Bay, Delaware, and the Sea. Let his plan be what it may, Gen. Washington, with a gallant Army is gone to enter a Caveat. The General with his Army passed thro this City yesterday, and they made a fine appearance. To aid the Army, and make the business secure, Congress has called for Militia from this State, Delaware, Maryland, and the Northern Counties of Virginia. Should Gen. Howe venture to enter the Country against this force, I think his ruin will be sure, notwithstanding we are told his Master depends on the \""desperate efforts that Generals Howe and Cornwallis must make to redeem their Bankrupt honor.\"" So, we learn from France, the King of England hath said. We have no reason to suppose, from our foreign intelligence that a war in Europe will immediately take place, but that every preparation for it is making remains without doubt- and in the mean time we shall surely receive most substantial Aid from our friends there. The fleet of France grows stronger daily, and with it, the spirit of the Court rises, as appears by the answer made to Lord Stormont when he told the french Minister that \""the peace cannot continue long if N. America continues to draw supplies from France.\"" \""Nous ne desirons pas la Guerre/ et nous ne le craignons pas.\"" In truth, every art of falsehood and fraud has been practised to prevent a war there, but it seems clear that this will not long prevail. Dr. Lee is returned from Spain and is gone to the Prussian Court. That Monarch is fond of commerce and is desirous of being acquainted with the whole nature of ours. He is offended with the Court of London, and has no reason to fear its resentment. We have good reason to expect considerable advantage from his friendship. If our funds fail us not, and our Union continues, no cause was ever safer than ours. To prevent the former, most extensive and vigorous taxes should immediately take place. The sum in circulation is immense and no corrective can be applied but Taxation, nor was there ever a time when the vast plenty of money rendered that business more easy. The Loan Office, with that, will I believe answer, and upon the success of our funds will probably depend the Unity of our exertions. The Confederation goes on but slowly, occasioned by the immensity of business created by the war. But I find our right to our Charter bounds, as stated by our Act of Government will be strongly contested.(2) The Charter of 1609 it is said has been vacated, and that no transfer of that Charter right can be shewn from the Company to the people of Virginia. That therefore the ungranted lands were the property of the Crown, and being taken from it by common exertions, must become common Stock. Will you be so kind as favor me with your reasons and authorities in  support of our right? I am with great regard & esteem, dear Sir Your most affectionate and obedient [Servt.], Richard Henry Lee  ""

General Washington was at Wilmington last Night, and his Army is there to day. The Militia are turning out with great Alacrity both in Maryland and Pensilvania. They are distressed for Want of Arms. Many have none others have only little fowling Pieces. However, We shall rake and scrape enough to do Howes Business, by the favour of Heaven.  Howe must have intended that Washington should have sent his Army up to fight Burgoine. But He is disappointed.  The Kindness of Heaven, towards Us, has in nothing appeared more conspicuous, than in this Motion of Howe. If the Infatuation is not so universal as to seize Americans, as well as him, it will prove the certain Destruction of Burgoines Army.  The New England Troops and N. York Troops are every Man of them at Peeks Kill and with Gates. The Massachusetts Regiments are all with Gates.  Gen. Washington has none but Southern Troops with him, and he has much the largest Army to encounter.  If My Countrymen do not now turn out and do something, I shall be disappointed indeed. One fifth Part of Burgoines Force has been totally destroyed by Starks and Herkermer. The Remainder must be shocked and terrified at the Stroke. Now is the Time to strike.

  Dr Sir Philadelphia Aug. 26th 1777 I have been in daily expectations of setting off for the Southward for AUGUST 26, 1777  some time past, and therefore have omitted writing to you, and indeed we have not until very lately had any thing to write about. At length the campaign begins to be active, and I am, though exceedingly anxious to get home, induced to defer my journey until something material shall happen between the two grand armies who are now approaching each other.  After many unaccountable movements the fleet and army under the Hows has reached so far up Cheseapeak as to have their rear above Baltimore, and their van a good way into the Susquehana. No accounts are yet received of their landing. General Washington has already marched with a gallant army composed of Southern Troops to oppose them; and a few days will bring him sight of them. He will we hope be powerfully supported by the brave and martial militia of Maryland and Pennsylvania. In short, Sir, our hopes are very high that a capital blow will be given to the enemy in every quarter. Burgoin already feels the force and spirit of the New York and Eastern Militia. A choice body of 1500 men were encountered by about two thousand New Hampshire Militia, and routed with the loss of 12 hundred killed and taken with all their artillery. Another brave action was fought by a party of New York militia, who, tho' surprised by an ambuscade, fought with most obstinate perseverance from nine until three o'clock, when the enemy were forced to retire, having suffered great slaughter. What renders this action remarkable is, that, upon the first surprise 200 out of seven hundred were panic-struck and fled; the commanding officer was wounded, and many brave officers were killed very early in the engagement, yet the men, with a courage that would do honour to the best veterans in Europe, sustained the engagement under every disadvantage, and under a very bloody slaughter, until they gained an undisputed victory. The particulars of these actions you will find in the inclosed papers, and I touch upon them here only because I deem them happy presages of the accomplishment of what I have always hoped and wished for, that our militia would become good soldiers. Happy improvement! What foreign force, or domestic ambition should we then have any thing to fear from?  General Nash with his Brigade has passed through this City, and they appeared very well. I saw Captain Caswell, he is well, but had no time to talk with me.  I wish, Sir, I could tell you the Congress improve in wisdom and virtue, but as I hope soon to see you, I shall reserve what I have to say of them.

  Hond Sir Phila Augt 26 1777 Since my last of abt the l9th Inst(1) I have by the good hand of Providence been regaining my Health, have been able to attend Congress ever Since, tho I recover Strength very slowly; am not able at this Time to write Mrs. Williams. You will please to let her & my other dear Friends know the better State of my Health.  In a joint Letter of last Even'g We informd you of the Intelligence We have of the Howes Fleet & Army. There is a report the army is landed at George Town & Frederic Town, up Sassafrass River in Maryland, but I believe very uncertain, as no Express has brot it. It is said They had a most remarkably safe & quick Passage up Cheasapeak Bay, that there is commonly more danger in that Navigation than a West India or European Voyage, & that a Single Ship is generally 8 days in getting as high as the whole Fleet arrivd in Three. I trust their Design must have been to attack this City, that They were detered from attempting it up this River by finding our Army so near, & so much Fire Craft, &c prepared to meet them, (They have minute Intelligence from those Enemies of God & Man the Tories). It seems probable their next Intention was to come up the River Elk at the head of the Bay. They are in, & within about 12 miles of New Castle & make their attempt that Way, & have lain out of sight so long on purpose that Genl Washington might return to his Station, which by the united opinion of his Genl. Officers he had determined & which was approved by Congress, & beginning to execute the moment we were advised of their being in the Bay, which occasioned his return. He passed thro the City on Sat. morn'g last, another Brigade passd yesterday morn'g. 4000 Militia of this State are ordered & on the proper ground, 1000 from Delaware, 2000 from Maryland & upwd of 2000 from the nearest parts of Virginia are called upon & hope will be seasonable.  Whether the Enemy on getting Intelligence of these Things will think it prudent to hazard so much I cant say, but believe it is more than They expected.  Indeed were it not for the abounding Sins & wholly unreformed State of the Country, I shod dare to hope that God in Mercy had blinded the minds & darkened the councils of Enemies & turned them into foolishness. I know not what may yet be, but it wod seem they had lost the Season, & must render their troops sickly on Ship board so long in extream Heat & neglected for Them a happy Season to join & cooperate with Burgoyne, or fall upon other parts of N England, & effectually pre- AUGUST 27, 1777  vent any succours to the Northward, & so leave in Burgoynes power to accomplish his Rage, which Howe might have ravaged & desolated our Country & reduced Us to amazing distress & effected more than the conquest of this city. But We know not what certainty what is before Us, & may be sanguine. But this is certain N England has vast Occasion to bless & praise the Lord, for his wonderous Mercy in our Deliverance from the dreadful Scourge. The distress had been beyond all discription had our Enemy invaded them in so critical a Moment. O that there was an heart in our Countrymen. May God in infinite Mercy pour out his Spirit upon Us, I hope & trust is the earnest Cry of all that Love his Name.  I am glad to See a Day of Fasting is appointed in Contt & Massa. May We no longer mock the Almighty with deceitfull Words from feigned Lips. The Time is elapsed & the Post on the point of Setting out.

  My dear and honourd Sir Philadelphia 27h Augt. 1777 Mr Thorne deliverd me your favour of the 15t Instant. I participate in the Distress & Anxiety you must have felt at the prospect of Genl Burgoine's Approach attended by murdrous Savages and no less cruel European Troops. That gracious Being who has hitherto protected us will I trust disappoint the destructive Projects of our Enemies. To him let us look up for Protection; and our Efforts for our own self preservation will be blessed with Success. The signal Victory gained at Bennington; the severe blow given to the Indians by our Tryon militia, and the Courage and Perseverance of the Garrison at Fort Schuyler, join'd to General Burgoine's Temerity, and Genl Howes great Distance which must effectually prevent his giving (1) any Succour in Season; Above all the present Security which the Eastern States derive from the remote Situation of General Howe which leaves them at full Liberty to employ their whole Strength to the Northward-All these Circumstances united will probably give a happy turn to our affairs, and oblige Mr Burgoine to retreat with more Rapidity than he advanced.  We have Reason to hope that General Arnold will raise the Siege of Fort Schuyler as he writes that the militia of Tryon support him with the AUGUST 27, 1777  utmost alacrity. This we may reasonably conclude will settle the minds & secure the Fidelity of the six nations and our western frontier. Indeed we have the strongest assurances that on this Event they will take an active part and retaliate on General Burgoine who under the guise of Religion and Humanity has Been the Author of Cruelties at which his Countrymen must blush, and which must stain the page of British History with indelible Infamy.  Col. Ogden has made a successful Sortie on Staten Island and took a hundred Prisoners, but this fortunate maneuvre was unhappily marr'd by General Sullivan who attempting a like Enterprize suffered his rear Guard to be cut off, so that tho' nothing coud equal the Cowardice of the Enemy, nor exceed the gallantry of the Continental Troops, the Account is nearly balancd.  General How has certainly landed his army near the Head of Chesepeake about 48 miles from this City. General Washington is on his way from this city to meet him. He writes Congress that the militia shew the greatest alacrity to support him. Those who are Judges assure me that General Howe coud not have Chosen a place in this part of the Continent to which more good men coud have been drawn on a sudden Emergency to oppose him. I need not tell you, who are so great a master of Geography, that his army is now near 230 miles from the Sea. What Advantages he proposes by taking this ground is hard to be conceivd. His Object is undoubtedly Philadelphia; nothing else is of sufficient moment. To obtain it he must leave his shipping at a great distance and give G Washington an oppertunity of taking his own Time, and his own Ground, to harrass and oppose him. A few weeks, perhaps days, will settle the point between the Competitors. The people here in general are firm and pleasd with the Hopes of success. I have not seen a single family moving out of the Town, nor a single Feature discomposed with Fear.  I am Dear & hond Sir, your Dutiful Son & most obed Servt,  Jas.

  Dear Sir, 27th August 1777 The Carolina News papers had announced my loss by the Sudden death of our late friend Doctor Air some days before your favor of the 24th July came to hand. The first Stroke affected me deeply, I felt myself marked again by a Shadow, but from the frequent alarms which have been repeated in my history by Similar disappointments AUGUST 27, 1777  I have learned that all events are directed by Supreme Wisdom & from that persuasion I would not hesitate, even in the gush of irresistible Tears, to acknowledge, \""Whatever is is best.\""  I wish it was in my power to join other friends in Offices of consolation to the distressed Widow, the big tear which at this Instant overflows each Eye, Sympathises in her complaints, but at this distance I can offer nothing but wishes that She may Submit with Christian fortitude to the desire of providence & learn betimes to Say, \""Thy Will be done.\""  I had paid so little attention to my own affairs for a long time before the public commanded me upon this unreasonable Service, that I cannot remember particular accounts. My Books & papers were carried to my Mepkin Plantation where I had intended to have devoted three or four days to the Service of arrangement, but I was soon convinced my hopes were ill founded, therefore I huddled them into Trunks confiding in providence for a future opportunity. In this State of the Case I cannot recollect the Amount of Mr. Air's debt. There is a Bond for a much larger Sum than he owes me. It was taken in that Style, when we were in England in order to include such Sums as he might be Supplied with on my Account after I should leave that Kingdom. I impressed the advice of frugality upon his mind for his own Sake, & when we arrived in Carolina I had the Satisfaction to find he had paid proper attention to my Sentiments, for he had room enough under my indulgence to have used Several, perhaps four or five hundred pounds Sterling more. As I remember, his Balance to me was between fifteen hundred & two thousand pounds Currency out of which he had a right to a considerable deduction for his Accounts of Medicine &ca, the real Balance therefore cannot be great. Be that as it may, I request you to take upon you the trouble of the Administration of his Estate & when please God we meet my Account shall be adjusted in a manner perfectly to your Satisfaction. If he had left a poor & friendless Widow my Love for him would have prompted me to offers which would now be improper. But if it shall appear that he has not left enough to pay off all his engagements I shall not count any deficiency towards me a loss. You now know my mind, & I know you to be an honest & good Man, therefore act in the premises as you Shall judge proper.  You will have heard before this reaches you of the many extraordinary Movements of the Grand Army of our Enemy, which at length have terminated so far as to effect a landing at the head of Elk River, about 45 or 50 Miles from this place within the State of Maryland. General Washington with upwards of 12000 Continentals & an innumerable hive of Militia are waiting their approaches. It seems the long Voyage from New York to Chesepeak Bay had greatly hurt their Cavalry, these are turned into Corn feilds & pastures to recruit &   when they are a little recovered the grand March for this City may be attempted, in the meantime they are Sustaining losses every day. We have already possession of 84 Soldiers & Sailors by Capture & desertion without the loss of a Man on our Side. Some of these assure us that the Navy & transports are not above half Manned & these very sickly & also that both Soldiers & Sailors are a tiptoe for desertion, they add that many more than these 84 had deserted but had taken different routes into Maryland & Virginia.  'Tis reasonable from many circumstances to beleive Mr. Howe would not have attempted his present Seeming plan if he had not been amused by that fop Burgoyne with hopes of being joined by his \""retired Arm\"" of which he [. . .] boasts in his proclamation. The Checks which that Braggadocia has already received will stop his Career. He will be fortunate even if he can tread back his Steps with half his Troops & cross the Lakes again. You will learn many particulars from the News papers which I shall put under Cover with this. One would naturally ask why did we Suffer Burgoyne to come so far, if 'tis in our power to drive him back, it certainly was in our power to have hindred his advances? This is very true, but it is equally & lamentably true that people on this side are all too eagerly scrambling for the fruit before they have effectually secured the property of the Orchard. Every Body bent upon making Money by every possible practice, & those who ought to be watchful & attentive to public Safety will not act but upon the Spur of occasion. The evacuation of Ticonderoga in the manner & at the time of the Act was shameful. I spent some hours last Night in examining papers relative to that Incident which prove to me that our Guardians had been all Nodding-the Commander in Chief of the Northern department absent from the post of Duty, present they say at his own Farms & Estates-the Commanding Officer at the post so totally inapprehensive of danger he had not made one disposition for removing the Military & other Stores, nor the Sick, untill the very hour of retreat-which in that extremity resembled the most precipitate flight & was consequently followed by a very heavy loss-all our Cannon & Stores & not a few Lives.  I wish I could even excuse Congress from a share of general blame. But to do them justice they must participate. They were lulled by misplaced confidence & that kind of timidity which makes Men too often neglect their most important duties through fear of offending popular Men. However although I would no more excuse any who were the means of losing that important post because good consequences may & are likely to spring from their neglect or misconduct than I do Judas because he was an Instrument in the work of Redemption, yet I begin to see in a new instance that whatever is is best. Our apparent Loss will be our gain. We shall probably ruin Burgoyne's  Army & contend with Mr. Howe's at much less risque than we could have done if the two had united in any part of the Jerseys or on the Pennsylvania Shore any where within the Capes of Delaware. Mr. Burgoyne's ill success will damp Mr. Howe & I hope in a few Weeks you will learn that these blustering Heroes have ended the Campaign by escaping with fragments of their pretended omnipotency.  The present hour is teeming with the fate of our Union. Thank God, notwithstanding some things in the Cabinet as in the field, look untoward, I feel confident of a happy event. You must expect in Carolina a brush from the tail of this Comet & should be upon guard. Dear Sir, I repeat my good wishes to yourself & Daughters & am with great regard &ca.(1)  ""

  Philadelphia August 29. 1777 My dearest Friend Fryday  The Newspapers enclosed, will give you, all the Intelligence, of any Consequence.  General Washington with a very numerous Army, is between Wilmington and the Head of Elke. How will make but a pitifull Figure. The Militia of four States, are turning out, with much Alacrity, and chearfull Spirits. The Continental Army, under Washington, Sullivan and Nash, besides is in my Opinion more numerous, by several Thousands, than Howes whole Force. I am afraid that He will be frightened and run on board his ships and go away, plundering, to some other Place.  I almost wish he had Philadelphia, for then he could not get away. I really think it would be the best Policy to retreat before him, and let him into this Snare, where his Army must be ruined. However this Policy will not be adopted.  In a Letter from good Authority, Mr. Paca, we are informed that many dead Horses have been driven on the Eastern shore of Maryland. __Horses thrown overboard, from the Fleet, no doubt.  Price current. £4 a Week for Board, besides finding your own Washing, shaving, Candles, Liquors, Pipes, Tobacco, Wood &c. Thirty shillings a Week for a servant. It ought to be 30s. for the Gentleman and £4 for the servant, because he generally eats twice as much and makes twice as much trouble.  Shoes five Dollars a Pair. Salt, 27 dollars a Bushell. Butter 10s. a Pound. Punch twenty shillings a Bowl.  All the old Women and young Children are gone down to the Jersey shore to make Salt. Salt Water is boiling all around the Coast, and I AUGUST 29, 1777  hope it will increase. For it is nothing but heedlessness, and shiftlessness that prevents Us from making Salt enough for a Supply. But Necessity will bring Us to it.  As to sugar, Molasses, Rum &c. We must leave them off. Whisky is used here instead of Rum, and I dont see but it is just as good. Of this, the Wheat and Rye Countries can easily distill enough, for the Use of the Country.  If I could get Cyder, I would be content.  The Business of the Continent has been in so critical and dangerous a situation for the last 12 Months, that it was necessary the Massachusetts should have a full Representation, but the Expences of living are grown so enormous, that I believe it will be necessary to reduce the Number of Delegates to three after this Campaign is over.

  Philadelphia August 30th: 1777 My Friend Saturday  A Letter from General Washington, was received last Night by the President, which I read. It is dated the 29th Yesterday.(1)  The Enemy are in Possession of the Head of Elke, a little Town,  at the Head of the River Elke, in which they found a Quantity of  Corn and Oats, belonging to the States. Waggons were so universally  AUGUST 30, 1777  taken up, in conveying away the valuable Effects of the Inhabitants, that none could be procured to transport this Grain. Part of their Army, is advanced to Grays Hill about two Miles from the Head of Elke, but whether to take Post there, or only to cover while they remove their Plunder, from the Head of Elke is uncertain.  Our Army is at Wilmington. We have many Officers out reconnoitring the Country and the Enemy. Our Scouting Parties have taken between Thirty and Forty Prisoners, and Twelve Deserters are come in from the Fleet and Eight from the Army.  They say the Men are generally healthy, but their Horses have suffered much by the Voyage.  These Prisoners and Deserters are unable to give any other Intelligence. The Enemy give out, that they are Eighteen Thousand strong. But these are like Burgoines \""Make Believes\"" and \""Insinuations.\"" We know better; and that they have not Ten Thousands.  The Militia from four States are joining General Washington, in large Numbers.  The Plan of their military Operations, this Campaign, is well calculated for our Advantage. I hope We shall have heads and Hearts to improve it.  For my own Part, I feel a secret Wish, that they might get into this City, because I think it more for our Interest that they should be cooped up here than that they should run away again to N. York. But according to present Appearances they will not be able to get here. By going into Cheasapeak Bay, they have betrayed a Dread of the Fire Works in the River Delaware, which indeed are formidable. They must make the most of their Time, for, They cannot rationally depend upon so fine a Season, late in the fall, and Early in Winter, as they had the last Year. September, October, and November are all that remain.  We expect Hourly, Advices from Gates and Arnold. We have Rumours of an Expedition to Long Island under Parsons, and another to Staten Island, under Sullivan, but no regular Accounts.

I am strongly impressed with an opinion that Mr. Howe will not detach any of his forces either to Annapolis or Baltimore, before he either is checked, or succeeds against Genl. Washington. I do not beleive he has above 12,000 effectives, & rather suspect his force does not exceed 10,000.

  Dear Sir,(1) 30th Augst 1777 I am much indebted for your friendly Letter of the 4th Ulto. which Mr. Donaldson delivered me three days ago. 'Tis true the present or the late measures in your State Seem untoward, but good Men must not therefore desert their posts, 'tis their duty through good Report & through evil Report to strive against the powerful Stream of popular error without uniting in party Spirit on either Side, & from a persuasion  AUGUST 30, 1777  that the majority never mean to hurt themselves, labour by good examples & seasonable advice to lead them into a better way.  We ought to look with the most watchful attention in order to discover if there be any, our most rooted Enemies blazing in the guise of enthusiastic patriotism. Such, when found out, are easily removed without blows. The prescription by one of the early Christians for marking out a vain Religionist, will apply extremely well in detecting a Sinister patriot, but we must not be too hasty in our conclusions. All Men are liable to Err, & often we see the best become dupes of their own policy. Our freind General McIntosh will remember my Sentiments upon his very favorite Constitution & acknowledge that the best Rules may not only lose their efficacy but even become pernicious perhaps destructive by misapplication. 'Tis more essential to know how to apply with advantage, than merely to know, I foresaw that a Stark-naked democracy which might have been in times of tranquility a happy form of Government in Pennsylvania. would be a rueful project for the conservation of a handful of Men of dissiminated affections & attachments within, engaged at the same time in a public & violent War which demanded the purest wisdom to contrive & the utmost vigour to execute means even for Self defence, & now with great grief & concern I learn of the bad effects. But for all this we must not dispair, we must not turn our backs & conclude that all is lost. Every honest Man, indeed every discreet Man who means to promote his own, as well as the welfare of the Community, when he discovers that neither Men nor measures have a tendency to that point will exercise all his powers to effect a happy Resolution. Perhaps after a little time even your present form of Government may be made happy. God forbid you should Sink under the present convulsions. Of all the Mad Schemes you have been pestered with that of uniting the opposite Shores of Savanna within one State appears to be most frantic & no doubt has been the provocative to that frenzy for indiscriminately mixing the best friends & most bitter Enemies of Georgia & attempting to rob the former of their unalienable property. Severe & unjust as the attack is upon me in that Incident I will not abate of my Zeal for the Interest & happiness of that branch of the thirteen United Independent States of America. I am of opinion that when the Ruling powers & people of Georgia in general have reflected on the evil consequences which must follow the execution of the \""Act for opening a Land Office & for the better Settling & Strengthening the State\"" in its full extent they will hasten to make Such alterations & exemptions as justice & Sound policy shall dictate.(2) I can hardly indulge my Self in thinking it necessary to prompt them on this occasion, nevertheless that I may not be charged with remissness of Duty to my Country & to my Children I shall make a proper representation & every Suitable effort to deprecate greater evils.  I beleive Congress will interpose a recommendation if I ask for it. If  I do, my representation shall be in terms which will not dishonour Georgia nor its Government. I may seek & obtain redress to my Self & for others in Similar circumstances without attempting to obstruct any of those good effects which the Majority of the Legislature must have had in view when they framed the Law.  One circumstance which has Soured minds of your people is undoubtedly that in which the indiscreet Geo. McIntosh has had so great a Share.(3) As we are all friends I may venture to Speak voluntarily as well as freely to you. I cannot bring my Self to be Advocate for the transgressions, wittingly committed, even of a Brother. I have carefully read the printed Case of that unfortunate Gentleman & upon my honour from that very Paper he may be charged to have been wilfully highly Criminal. The testimonies which set forth his Zeal in promoting the general Association prove at the Same time the most flagrant violation of that Sacred band by his close, intimate & Interested connexions with Men who were not only Nonassociates but notorious Enemies to the Cause which America at the hazard of Life & fortune was Strugling to Support. If he was forward openly to keep Committees together in the part of the Country where he resided he has proved by the most favorable affidavits of Mr. Baillie & Mr. Demere that he was secretly counteracting & even Sapping their Resolutions. In a word I never will beleive a Man very chaste who delights in private meetings with harlots & debauchers & who affords means for promoting their Commerce although he Should produce a thousand witnesses of his constant repetition of the 7th Commandment at the regular Striking hours of a Town Clock. I shall attempt to open Georges Eyes that he may see his indiscretion that he may acknowledge it too, to his Countrymen & promise hereafter to take every opportunity to make atonement. The General (4) knows my Sentiments pretty clearly already on this Subject. If he had taken a wise part in the beginning, if he had not attempted to knock down Suspicions too well founded, much trouble might have been Saved. By misconduct this affair has become not only a party & family but a national quarrel & God only knows when & in what intent it will end. For his sake will we pretend to Love Mercy let us also deal justly. A transgression against our Associations against our Laws is a greater Crime than Housebreaking, & by a Man vested with public confidence is aggravated in proportion to its pernicious influence & effects. Let us in this day of tryal divest ourselves of partial affections, extend every warrantable kindness of humanity even to conquered Enemies but let us know no Man as a friend or a Brother who in the Strictest Sense of the term, falls Short of the Duty of friend & Brother. To Neutrals let our Love be neutral, our eyes & Ears attentive to apostate Guardians, Chiefs & Trustees becoming severity should be exercised, they know that times of Civil War exclude the virtues of Charity & forgiveness &c &c. Sir I have written the impressions of my  heart, a Heart which never deliberately consented to an uncharitable or Cruel Act, but which had ever fortitude enough to blame a criminal friend, without fearing consequences of resentment, & I have detained you so long on this painful topic because from that Source I am persuaded much of the Evil complained of in Georgia has Sprung. All may be rectified & made Smooth again by prudent & wise exertions on the part of those who have given offence to the public & furnished such Characters as you have depicted in the Sequal of your Letter with opportunities of figuring in the Language of public Spirit. For the Sake of a bleeding Country I hope the General will reflect on these circumstances in an hour of composure. If he does I am sure his good sense will prompt him to do what he must know will be right.  I will take the liberty of inclosing with this a few News papers. You will learn from them many particulars relative to the Belligerent powers in this Neighborhood. In general I may say & with much Satisfaction we are Stronger & the Enemy much weaker than the parties respectively were nine or even two Months ago. Our Army is better than ever it was, theirs is worse. Our finances are streched, theirs are broken to pieces. The present hour is big with the fate of America, the proximity of Armies within 50 Miles so. west & two hundred & fifty North East of this Center shew me that our grand dispute is drawn to an important Crisis. I feel confident it must be from an assurance which has never failed me that our Cause is good.  I remain with great truth, Dear Sir &ca.  ""

Altho' this disaster for the present is grievous, yet I think it has put Burgoyne into our power,  SEPTEMBER 1, 1777  and I hope he will not be suffered to slip out of it. Mr. Howe has planned his operations in such a manner, as to give us a vast advantage, both of him and Burgoyne. He is at the head of Elke about 55 miles from this city. Genl. Washington is at Wilmington, about 15 miles on this side of him, with a noble army of continental troops, and a large body of militia, which is constantly and rapidly increasing. Whether the General will be compelled to depart from his Fabian System or not time will discover. A general action, successful to us is destructive to them, and even if they should be successful and keep the field, they will loose so many men, as to be crippled after it.

  My dear Philadelphia September 1.1777. Monday We have now run through the Summer, and altho the Weather is still warm, the fiercest of the Heats is over. And altho the extream Intemperance of the late Season has weakened and exhausted me, much, yet I think upon the whole I have got thro it, as well as upon any former Occasion.  A Letter from General Washington, dated Saturday, informs that our light Parties have brought in four and twenty Prisoners, more.(1) So that the Prisoners and Deserters, since Mr. Howe landed is near an hundred.  The Question now is, whether there will be a general Engagement? In the first Place I think, after all that has past it is not good Policy for Us to attack them unless We can get a favourable Advantage of them, in the Situation of the Ground, or an Opportunity to attack a Detachment of their Army, with superiour Numbers. It would be imprudent, perhaps for Us, with our whole Force to attack them with all theirs.  But another Question arises, whether Mr. Howe will not be able to compell Us to a General Engagement? Perhaps he may: but I make a Question of it: Washington will maneuvre it with him, a good deal to avoid it. A General Engagement, in which Howe should be defeated, would be ruin to him. If We should be defeated, his Army would be crippled, and perhaps, We might suddenly reinforce our Army which he could not. However all that he could gain by a Victory would be the Possession of this Town which would be the worst Situation he could be SEPTEMBER 1, 1777  in, because it would employ his whole Force by Sea and Land to keep it, and the Command of the River.  Their principal Dependence is not upon their Arms, I believe so much, as upon the Failure of our Revenue. They think, they have taken such Measures, by circulating Counterfeit Bills, to depreciate the Currency, that it cannot hold its Credit longer than this Campaign. But they are mistaken.  We however must disappoint them, by renouncing all Luxuries, and by a severe (Economy. General Washington setts a fine Example. He has banished Wine from his Table and entertains his Friends with Rum and Water. This is much to the Honour of his Wisdom, his Policy, and his Patriotism, and the Example must be followed, by banishing sugar, and all imported Articles, from all our Families. If Necessity should reduce Us to a Simplicity of Dress, and Diet, becoming Republicans, it would be an happy and a glorious Necessity.  Yours-Yours-Yours .  ""

  Sir Philadelphia Septr 1st 1777 Since our last (1) when we Informed you Genll How had landed his Army at the head of Elk the Enemy have made but little progress and have extended their Army but about 4 miles. Genll Washington has made his head quarters at Willmington about 14 miles from the Enemy. Genll Green about 4 miles advanced towards them with about 4000 men. The Militia of this Country are daily reinforcing Genll Washington and Are employed in harrassing Genll Hows partys which oblidge them to keep pretty close & Compact. It is supposed our Army now Consists of near Twenty thousand men under Genll Washington & Increasing, our parties have taken about a hundred since their Landing Including some deserters, the Enemy have lost a Considerable Number of their horses since they landed Nothing appears discouraging in this Quarter, if the Enemy Should Advance it would give us an Advantage of throwing a large body of Men in their rear. Appearances are favourable but Success is of the Lord, to whom we would Commit our Cause & hope for a prosperous issue. Congress are Deeply engaged in financiering in Contriving ways & means. All agree in taxing largely but that will not afford us Immediate supplies, France & Spain Offer to Lend us, will it do to borrow at least so much as to pay the Interest by bills drawn on our Commissioners there? Will that Induce our Continental bill holders to place their money in the Loan Offices as fast as we want it? Ought we or does policy require now our Streights are great for speedy Supplies that in order to obtain them we may be oblidgd to borrow on France & Spain sufficient to pay the Interest by Bills drawn in favour of our Lenders on our Commissioners there which will serve their Interest not only in Specie but payable in Europe whereby the great risque & Charge of Transportation is saved & will bring us Considerably in Debt to those foreign Powers.

You will please to credit me therefor, with the Invoices by Capt St Clair & Williamson as heretofore requested.(2)  In the Bale No 6 per Capt Hodges, was 1 Ps of russia Duck more than was charged in the Invoice, which is passed to your Credit in 270 [Rrtn?].(3)  Agreable to your Request, an Extract of your last Letter relative to the Indulgence of your Court to Adventurers in the Article of Tobacco is inserted in the publick prints.  When I wrote You last, We left General Howe at Amboy a Seaport Town in the State of New Jersey, to which he retreated for the Security of his Army. After he had there taken Post, & recovered from the Fatigue & Confusion which generally attend a Retreat, several attempts were made to surprize Part of General Washingtons Army, & to manoeuvre him out of the Strong Post which he possessed in that State, but these proving unsuccessful induced General Howe to remove his Troops to Staten Island, which is about 18 miles in Length, & lays on the Jersey Shore extending from Amboy towards New York, & forming Part of the Harbour of that City. Here he continued a few days & again embarked his Troops on a secret Expedition, intending as was supposed for the Delaware, or for the North River which leads up to the back Part of the State of New York, against which General Burgoyne was bringing his Army. About the 23d of July he sailed from New York Harbour, with a Fleet of 280 Sail including Ships of War, appearing after a few Days  SEPTEMBER 1, 1777  off Egg Harbour about half Way to the Capes of Delaware, & about the first of August at the Capes. General Washington in the Interim, leaving 4 or 5000 Men at the North River, marched about 12 or 14000 towards Philadelphia, where an equal number of the Militia were ordered to be in Readiness to join them; but to the Surprize of most people the Fleet again disappeared, and was not seen from the Land for three Weeks, when Information was sent from Virginia, that It appeared off their Capes, & in a few Days that the Whole Fleet had reached the Head of Cheesepeak Bay, which is about fifty Miles from hence. There General Howe has debarked his Troops, & General Washington with the Army aforesd, reinforced by the Militia, who voluntarily collect in Numbers far exceeding the Requisitions of Congress, has taken Post within six Miles of him, & is constantly harrassing him. What the Event will be, Time must determine, but I think We have not much Reason to be apprehensive, unless providence should remarkably frown on our Cause.  Philadelphia is evidently the Object of General Howe's Wishes, but this is vastly inadequate to the risque of marching from his shipping, since the Loss of it on our Side would not be much felt, & a Defeat on his would decide the Cause against him, & compell the whole of the British Troops to evacuate the Continent.  With Respect to General Burgoyne on the Western Frontiers, about the Beginning of July he made his approach to Tyonderoga, & to the Surprize of the whole Continent, Our General Officers in that Department at a Council of War determined to evacuate the Fort without firing a Gun, or securing or destroying the Stores & Baggage, notwithstanding they had 3000 effective Men in the Garrison, Plenty of Stores, & in ten or fifteen Days Time would have been reinforced with 6 or 8000 Men, if so many were necessary to raise the Seige. Their Conduct is highly resented, & a Court martial is ordered to [be] held on all the Generals aforesd.  By this Misconduct of four or five of our officers, General Burgoyne was flushed with Success, & published a pompous proclamation which being somewhat diverting is herewith inclosed.(4) This performance has answered the purpose of Amusement to our Wits, & of making the Author compleatly rediculous. He however thot the Country would be affected by it & pushed towards Albany (to which the North River is navigable for Transports) but has met with severe Checks, having lost at Fort Schuyler by a Sortie from the Fort about 300 Men, at Bennington about 900, & is now obliged to raise the Seige of the former. I sincerely hope that General Burgoyne whose Army does not exceed 6, or 7000 Men, will be hardy enough to attempt a March to Albany, as the Militia of the New England States who are ordered to oppose him, must be able to accomplish it with little Trouble. We have now a Number of Troops on that quarter equal to G. Burgoynes Army, & such large Reinforcements are ordered to General Gates who is an experienced officer  & has the Command there, that I fear Mr Burgoyne will be on the Retreat, before he can be brot to Action.  In Consequence of the Movement of General Howe to Cheesepeak Bay, I shall be glad if You will order one of the Salt Vessels (which I desired You to load for my Account), to Boston or any Port between that & Portsmouth, & the other to North Carolina consigned to Messr. Hughes & Smith of Edenton.  I remain Gentlemen with much Esteem, Your very hum Sert. E G.  N.B. In the publication of the Extract I have somewhat deviated from the Letter, but have endeavourd to retain the Speech of the Original.  ""

  Sir, Philada. Septr. 1st. 1777. Your several Favours to the 30th ulto. (inclusive) I have had the Honour of receiving in the Order of their Dates.  From the enclosed Resolves you will perceive, the Congress have appointed a Committee to collect and arrange the Evidence relative to the Evacuation of Ticonderoga, which will be afterwards transmitted to you, that a Court Martial may be thereupon instituted for the Trial of the general Officers who were in the Northern Department when the Evacuation took Place.(1)  The great Demand for Arms to equip the Militia who are called into Service, has induced the Congress to pass the enclosed Resolve, directing that a Number of Workmen (conversant in the Business of repairing Firelocks) should be immediately detached from the Militia to be employed in repairing the Arms in this City there being between two and three Thousand that in a short Time may be rendered fit for Use.(2)  I have the Pleasure to congratulate you on our farther Success in the Northern Department in raising the Seige of Fort Schuyler. The Enemy, on the Approach of Genl. Arnold, fled with the utmost Precipitation, leaving behind them their Tents, Ammunition, Provision, &c. As I forward herewith several Letters for you from that Quarter which  SEPTEMBER 1, 1777  I make no Doubt contain an Account of the Matter, I beg Leave to refer you to them for further Particulars.(3)  I have the Honour to be, with the greatest Respect, Sir, your most obed & very hble Serv.

  Dear sir. 1st Septem 1777 Since my last of the 11th Ulto. by Capt. Hornby our affairs in the Feild have acquired a more pleasing aspect. General Howe who we apprehended had been gone Eastward in order to form a junction with the foppish Burgoyne, has been floating round to Chesepeak Bay in a fleet of thirty Men of War & 280 Transport Vessels. The tediousness of his Voyage, hurt his Cavalry very much & 'tis not to be doubted that his Troops must also have suffered by sickness. About a Week ago he effected a Landing on the Banks of Elk River some 50 to 60 Miles distance from this spot upon which his Eye is fixed. The Horse were turned into Corn fields where many of them finished their Campaign by improper food. The Troops were stretching their Legs. Some of these also, perhaps upwards of ninety, have finished their Campaign, by Capture or voluntary desertion-among the latter about 15 seamen who unanimously report that the fleet is very sickly, not above half Manned, the Men exceedingly discontented & only waiting favorable opportunities to get off. General Washington at the head of a large well appointed Army 10 to 12 Thousand regulars, a fine train of Artillery & an uncertain but very numerous collection of Militia lie stretched along from Head Quarters at Wilmington to an encampment near the Enemy's Van watching & waiting for their motions. Our light Horse are employed in galling their flanks & seizing straglers in which they have been very successful. It appears to me this circuitous fetch by Mr. Howe must have been made in consequence of Burgoyne's rapid Entrance through the Country on this side Tyconderoga & in confidence of the \""Stretch of his Arms\"" which he so much boasts of. (1) You will read in the News Papers our successes against that Brute who pays ten Dollars for the Scalp of an Infant. The Check which he has received will undoubtedly leave Mr. Howe to play all the future game in this Quarter without his Partner. This places us in a situation much less to SEPTEMBER 1, 1777  be regretted than that which we should have been driven into, had the fop penetrated New York & approached this City through New Jersey. I am told he cannot attempt, even if he should escape across the Lakes, to bring his division round by Sea till the ensuing Year Sir William Howe has published another kind invitation to Rebels to go in to him & accept Pardon.(2) This he styles a Declaration & the language is more Courtly than any of his former Addresses of that kind. Nevertheless I believe he will receive more blows than proselytes. Our People seem to be very much in earnest to fight & a good watch is kept on the few disaffected in the environs of the Enemy's Camp.  We are now at the Eve of a grand Crisis. Much blood will be spilled & possibly the fate of American Independence suspended or confirmed in the course of this Month. I feel confident of success persuaded that our Cause is good & that it cannot fail. Indeed the many false steps which have been taken by the mighty omnipotent British Generals, are enough to make every man on this side confident. However the event of War is uncertain. I am therefore not free from a suitable concern for our freinds.  Yesterday the Executive Council of this State caused divers persons chiefly of the people called Quakers to be seized & their Papers inspected. Among the suspected are Israel & John Pemberton & others of the most respectable people of that profession. The ground for this exertion of power is an information of correspondencies carried on between the Quakers & the Enemy. That information is supported by Papers which had been lately found at Staten Island & indeed by the very unfreindly declarations openly made by the Quakers in general. What or whether any discoveries have been made has not transpired.(3)  Governor Penn & Mr Chief Justice Chew who had been on Parol are both removed from this State into a remote part of Jersey. (4) The Powers here act as we too often do to the southward, upon the spur of the occasion. All these & many better things ought to have been done if necessary, with more deliberation & consequently with more decency.  Congress is now engaged in ways & means for filling an almost exhausted Treasury without repeating an Emission of Paper Dollars. The favorite scheme is that of borrowing from France, which I esteem the most destructive step we can take, so far as for all internal demands & will be to all intents & purposes a further emission of Paper Money, infinitely more detrimental in its consequences than the evil which is dreaded from a further Issue of Dollars. It may deprive us too of the use of so much Money as we shall want in France for the most important occasions to which Paper Dollars are inadequate. I have endeavoured to point out ways & means by which our Treasury might be filled without either of the modes abovementioned. Make the Conditions of your Loan more favorable I might say more equitable to Lenders, & practice that frugality & economy in Public & private   affairs which was our boast in 1774 & from which particularly in Public Economy we have departed as widely as prodigality lies from discretion & virtue. This may employ a future hour between you & me. You will be astonished when you know all that may with too much truth be said upon the subject in one hour. At present be assured that affairs in the grand Circle are very unsatisfactory to every thinking disinterested Man. I judge so, because I not only feel my self dissatisfied but because I perceive a great majority are so, & hear them at different times acknowledge it. The cause may be, we begin to feel the weight of our grand contest & have not yet quite resolution enough to change our mode of living suitable to our circumstances. Luxury abounds here as it does in the more southern States & Luxury if we persevere in it will return us to dependence either upon Great Britain or transfer us to some less tolerable Master.  I now turn my attention to your favor of the 15 July which I received by the hands of Mr. Donaldson. The principal subject relative to your Brother Colo. George McIntosh is very affecting.(5) I have perused the printed Case according to your request with care & attention & I am sorry to tell you, he appears, from the most favorable representation in that State, to have acted, if not designedly a criminal part, yet a part extremely indiscreet & meritting Censure. This you may depend upon, it is the opinion of every person to whom I distributed that Paper, as far as I have learned, & you may almost infallibly rest assured it is the opinion of some who have not ventured to speak quite so plainly to you or him. I say this, alluding to one very particular Instance. The affidavits of Mr. Bailley & Mr. Demere which set forth strong appearances of Mr McIntosh's attachment to the American Cause, at the same time prove his close connexion with the declared inveterate Enemies of that Cause & this is confirmed by himself. Had this connexion been confined to common Civilities & innocent intercourse those disputes which our friend maintained in support of the Cause which he had espoused, might have been produced as evidence in his favour, but when it extended to Partnership in exportation & the management of the Voyage left to a Man who was notoriously a violater of the American Associations & a known fugitive from a Neighbouring State, suspicion lies hard against him, & rather gains strength from the Circumstance of Mr McIntosh's clearing the Vessel for Surinam. To judge charitably your Brother gave way to temptation & to say the least, acted very indiscreetly. He seems to have been in the class of those who wished the American Cause very well, but not so well, as to make any sacrifice of his Interest in order to promote its welfare, & I remember to have heard you declare your sentiments to this effect about a Month before the unlucky transaction which has occasion'd him & his friends so much trouble. I think he has severely smarted for his folly, for I am persuaded there was no Criminal design. I shall as  soon as he recovers from the Small Pox speak in the most friendly terms to him upon this business & every thing that my own honour & my allegiance will warrant I will do for restoring him to his family & I think it will be in his own power to restore himself to the favour & protection of his Country.  I must take every method in my power to shield my property in Georgia against the attacks of violence. I think however your Assembly upon reflection will before the 12 December either repeal or make such an explanation of the Act of Assembly which I suppose you allude to as will distinguish friends from Enemies.(6)  My good wishes attend Mrs. McIntosh & your whole family. I hope soon to take you by the hand & to assure you by every respectful & friendly Office how truly I am, Dear sir, Your most obedt servt.  Henry Laurens ""

There is but one Course for Us to take and that is to renounce the Use of all foreign Commodities. For my own Part I never lived in my whole Life, so meanly and poorly as I do now, and yet my Constituents will growl at my Extravagance. Happy should I be indeed if I could share with you, in the Produce of your little Farm. Milk and Apples and Pork and Beef, and the Fruits of the Garden would be Luxury to me.  We had nothing Yesterday from the General. Howes Army are in a very unwholesome Situation. Their Water is very bad and brackish, there are frequent Morning and Evening Fogs, which produce Intermittent Fevers in Abundance. Washington has a great Body of Militia assembled and assembling, in Addition to a grand Continental Army. Whether he will strike or not, I cant say. He is very prudent, you know, and will not unnecessarily hazard his.Army. By my own inward  SEPTEMBER 2, 1777  Feelings, I judge, I should put more to risque if I were in his shoes. But perhaps he is right.  Gansevoort has proved, that it is possible to hold a Post. Harkermer has shewn that it is possible to fight Indians, and Stark has proved that it is practicable, even to attack Lines and Posts, with Militia. I wish the Continental Army would prove, that any Thing can be done. But this is sedition at least. I am weary however, I own, with so much Insipidity.  St. Ledger and his Party have run away. So will Burgoine. I wish Stark had the Supream Command in the Northern Department. I am sick of Fabian Systems in all Quarters. The Officers drink a long and moderate War. My Toast is a short and violent War. They would call me mad and rash &c. but I know better. I am as cool as any of them and cooler too, for my Mind is not inflamed with Fear nor Anger, whereas I believe theirs are with both. If this Letter should be intercepted and published, it would do as much good, as another did two Years ago.  Adieu.  ""

  Dr Sir Philadelphia Septr 2d 1777 The inclosed paper will give you all the public intelligence since my last. The complexion of affairs is not yet become so determined that I can set off for home; but I am in daily expectations of some events which may determine my resolutions to that purpose.  Our finances have long engaged our attention in Congress, but we have not yet come to any conclusive Resolutions thereon. The subject is of the greatest importance, and truly too great for our talents. One thing every one seems clear in, that Taxation in a very liberal degree must take place. This, Sir, is so necessary that it must at all events be attempted every where. The quantity of money in circulation, and its consequent depreciation, and the accumulating debt of the public makes it inevitably necessary. I fear the system under consideration will not be so far mature before my departure that I can carry it with me, or know how to apply my endeavours at home to the perfection of it. I shall however make myself as much master as possible of the prevailing opinions thereon.  You will find by the intelligence that our affairs every where bear a promising aspect. I have the most sanguine hopes that this campaign will give a severe blow to the British arms; and I even look forward to an end of the war, much sooner than has hitherto appeared probable.

The Enemy remain inactive in the same Situation as I mentioned in my last. An ad- SEPTEMBER 2, 1777  Portrait of  William Howe  vanced Body of about 2,000 are a little on this Side the Head of Elk- their main Body lies a little to the South of Elk River. Genl. Washington has detached 1000 light Troops to watch Mr. Howes Motions and to annoy them as much as possible. Our Army is encamped on the Heights about Wilmington. Lines & small Redoubts are making in our Front. Sullivane's Division, about 1400 effectives, will join the main Army this Day. The Militia of this and the Delaware State turn out very generally, but Complaint for arms is universal. I hope Genl. Smallwood will be agreeable to the western Shore, and Colonel Gist to the Eastern Shore Militia. If Congress should be blamed, I must take a considerable Share of the Censure. I thought Mr. Smallwood had some personal Influence, & I know no officer in our State equal to him. I beleive Colo. Richardsons Battalion will be ordered to join the Eastern Shore Militia I submit to you the Propriety of ordering about 100 Militia to Jacob Giles or thereabouts to prevent the Enemy from sending small Parties to plunder.  I have just seen Genl. Howes Procla. of the 27th of Augst., inclosed by Gen W. to Mr. Hancock, & will if possible procure & send You a Copy.(1) He offers Pardon to all Inhabitants of Delaware, Pennsylvania, and the Eastern Shore Counties of Maryland, who will surrender themselves to any Detachment of his army, & that he will hereafter make known the Day after which his gracious favor shall cease. He denounces Vengeance against all found in Arms, and promises Protection to all who remain quiet & peaceable. He excepts from his Pardon all who have acted in the legislative & judicial authority of the new Government. He acquaints the Inhabitants that his army is under the strictest Discipline; & yet an affidavit is sent to Congress of a most violent attempt by some of his Troops to ravish a Girl of Credit & Family. I wish to see it published in our Paper and in Hand-Bills & dispersed in every Part of our State, with observations & Remarks. No faith, no Confidence can be placed in any promises of the Nation of Britain or any of her Generals. Genl. Howe & Burgoyne promised protection, & plundered both Friends & foes. The Jersies & N.

  Dear Sir, 2d September 1777. I had the pleasure of writing to you by Capt Hornby of the Georgia Troops under the 20th Ulto.  A few days ago by the transmission of a friend I was informed of an Act of Assembly lately passed in your State for vacating the Lands of all absentees after the 12 December next, notified by your Governor's proclamation.(1) It is not to be doubted but that all my Lands at Altamaha & Turtle River will come within the Letter of that Law although I cannot believe it possible to have been meant by an Individual of the Legislature. It should be considered that I continued the improvement & Cultivation of those remote frontier Settlements not only after all my Southern & Western Neighbors had removed but even long after the Cathiad Settlement & other interior inhabitants had left me-that Broughton Island & New Hope had been for Several Months exposed to the plunder & ravage of the Enemy-that five of my Negroes had been actually Stolen & carried away to St. Augustine-that the Man who had perpetrated that act of villainy had returned with a party in order to carry off as many more as he could take, that my escape from the heavy loss which would have happened if my Negroes had been at home was owing to mere accident-that I was left defenceless & that to have remained in that Situation would been an Act of temerity which would have encouraged the Floridians to persevere in their predatory War & eventually have been injurious to the States. SEPTEMBER 2, 1777  Perhaps it may be worthy of consideration too that I am now upon Duty in the Service of the thirteen United States, unable to quit my Post without permission.  In these Circumstances I request your friendly interposition to shield me against a damage which would on one hand be intolerable & on the other would Subject the State of Georgia to the charge of injustice & ingratitude. Perhaps the rigour of that Law in the particular Instance of my property might be eluded by Sending an overseer & a few Negroes to dig a Spade full of Earth & build a hut alternately on each Tract-but this is not what I aim at nor what I wish for; I have never in any part of my life practiced Jockeyship nor do I owe to dishonest artifice one farthing of my Estate I mean to claim the protection of the State in which my property lies, where, while I held it, my constant practice was to make it as far as possible Subservient to the good of the State, & which I did not abandon until it was impracticable for the State to afford me a defence against the threatned attacks of a contiguous Enemy.  I intreat you to take proper Counsel & to make proper Addresses by Remonstrance, Memorial or petition to the Governor & his Council & to the House of Assembly & obtain a reasonable Suspension of the impending Escheat or an explanatory Act of Assembly establishing such exceptions as shall to the House seem consistent with Justice & good policy, I may say consistent with the happiness & well being of the State. From your friendly Offers of Service & from your attachment to the Interest of your Country as well as from your known love of justice, I flatter my Self in a dependence upon your exertions in the premises & therefore I will not take upon another moment of your time upon this head, but to say that for the honour of Georgia I trust there will be a discrimination between its warmest friends & most inveterate Enemies.  Our Arms in the Northern department have lately been Successful. Mr. Burgoyne has failed in every attempt except in too many acts of infamous Butchery upon Women & Children by his Indian Allies, since he made the halt at Fort Edward by a moderate computation he has lost Two Thousand Men killed & taken prisoner. The loss of Indians proved too heavy for them to bear-in order to prompt them to action they were made Drunk & Mad-the Survivors therefore when they soberred returned mourning & murmurring to their respective Countries. This Circumstance added to the great loss before Fort Schuyler & the total defeat of Colonel Baum has obliged the fop who boasted of extending his Arms far to contract his remaining forces within the compass of a strong-post, where he has hedged himself between a River & a Woody Mountain, on the defensive he will soon from necessity be obliged to remove in three or four Weeks. The   Season & the want of provision & necessaries will compel him. Our Troops will in the mean time make his Situation extremely incommodius, & w ill hang on his Skirts in a retreat. The evacuation of Tyconderoga will probably prove a profitable event. No thanks by the bye are due to those who should have defended it.  The Check which the puffing Burgoyne has received will probably operate as a Check upon Mr. Howe who no doubt had been taught to expect that his Coadjutor would before this day have been Marching through Jerseys towards Philadelphia & have facilitated his own from Elk River. The Road is now Thorny-many a bruised head & wounded heel will there be if he Should make the attempt. I hold it impossible that he Should finesse & embark without a tryal, but there are wiser Men of a different opinion. His force is computed at 10,000. General Washington's regulars exceed that number & the Militia are innumeraable They are very many daily increasing & very willing to come to action. We are drawing to a Crisis, probably while I am writing the Fate of 13 United States is in decision. Delay will be pernicious to both, but most to the Enemy, however they have many resources & advantages. Our trust is in the Righteousness of our Cause which is intitled to the favour of providence. I will enclose with this 2 or 3 latest News papers. Believe me to be &ca.  ""

  My dear Sir [September 3? 1777](1) I recd your favour of the written at a time our dear natale Solum was in the greatest distress, and our Friends had every thing disagreeable to expect. Thro' the Bravery & good Conduct of Herkimer, Gaansvourt, & Willet, our Western Hemisphere is changed, the Clouds are dispersd, and we can view it without discomposure. To the Northward too the prospect brightens. The compleat Victory gaind by Stark with his militia over the large Detachment of Burgoine's Army sent to savage our North Eastern Frontier, cannot, under Heaven, fail of being productive of a variety of good Consequences. It has undoubtedly disappointed and depressed our Enemies; not less than it has encouraged and elated our Friends; And very probably deliverd our State from Ravage and Destruction which a vigorous Exertion of the Enemy, unsustaind as you then were, might easily have affected. Let us, my dear Sir, adore most thankfully that gracious Being whose Interposition on this trying Occasion seems to have been So manifest in our favour. At the same time the brave Men who so happily conducted those several Enterprizes ought to be forgotten.(2) On the Contrary they ought to experience the Gratitude of their Country by sensible Effects. Herkimer first reversd the gloomy Scene and with a Courage and perseverance that do him infinite Honour. But it is his misfortune to want the powers of Description, and we have a most lame and imperfect account of this great Event-great I call it, since, from the SEPTEMBER 3, 1777  severe Loss the Savages sustaind, it will not only give peace to our State with respect to the Indians but probably overawe all the Indians to the Southward. In this Light it appeard to General Washington who with a Benevolence peculiar to himself lamented that a more distinct Relation was not obtaind of this action, that the merit of the Commander & the militia might be properly understood by the world, & the former rewarded by his Country. I recommend this matter to your attention and any Letter you communicate for the purpose shall have its' full weight. It is difficult to fix a Reward for Herkimer. He does not want a Continental Command nor money. The Thanks of Congress and a sword will be readily granted. Can you think of any thing more suitable? (3) Gansevoort & Willet are in the highest Degree of Fame We have had such a train of disgrace at all our Forts, & lost them so unexpectedly-Let me except Sullivan's Island-that the brave Defence of Fort Schuyler has made the deepest Impression. The Reward due to these Gent. is not yet determined, but it is generally talked to raise Gansevoort to the Rank of Brigr. General, & Willet to that of Colonel.(4) Stark will also be provided for tho' he is something under the Clouds for refusing to serve under General Lincoln to whom he refusd the Command of the Troops, assigning as a Reason that Congress had done him Injustice in not promoting him.(5) General Schuyler prevailed on him to submit to Lincoln: but before that General's Arrival at Bennington he took Care to attack and defeat the Enemy. You'l allow this to be a handsome Apology for intemperate Expressions.  Doubtless you are anxious to know the Situation of the two grand armies. General Howe's main body lies South East of the Head of Elk about two miles. An Advancd party of about 2000 lie about the Head of Elk. General Washington's main Army lies on the Heights of Wilmington; an advanced party of 1000 picked Regular Troops and a number of militia hang on the Enemy's advancd party. The grounds about Wilmington are tolerably advantageous but the Country between that & Philad does not admit of any strong Post. Take for the rest an Extract of Hamilton's Letter to me of last Saturday. \""We must rely wholly upon our Numbers; the goodness of our Troops and our own good managemt of them. I see clearly we must either beat the Enemy in a general Action, or they will carry their point with respect to Philadelphia. It will not be very difficult. I am in hopes, to give them a handsome drubbing if we only have time to bring our whole army together assisted by 5 or 6000 militia well embodied, and I think we shall not want time for the purpose.\"" I only add that there have been some slight Skirmishes & our Army have taken about 70 Prisoners without loosing more than 2 or 3 men. About a dozen Deserters have come in. By every Account a powerful militia from Pensa., Delaware, Maryland & Virginia are collecting to Join General Washington; so that   numbers will not be wanting. People appear here to be in perfect security-not a family has movd. The Conjecture is that General Howe will not risk a Battle. His situation, whatever may have been his Hopes, is certainly much worse than when he was at Somerset Court house, & ours infinitely better on every Account. He has issued another Proclamation to try the Affections, or, as Ld North expressed it, to sound the Country.(6) It has no Effect. Nothing but a superiority in Arms will now serve his purpose. John Dickinson is once more in the feild & with George Reade accompanies Caesar Rodney the General of the Delaware Militia. The want of Horses & Desire of securing a Retreat by Lines or Forts are supposed to detain General Howe which gives General Washington immense advantages; as he has not yet all his regular Troops assembled.  Present my affectionate Regards to Mrs Livingston and all our Friends at both Mannors & believe me with the utmost Respect, Dear Sir, Your affectionate & most obed huml Servant,  Jas Duane P.S. Col. Wilson, Mr Morris, Mr Duer, the President &c &c present their Respects to you.  ""

(1)  As this Event is of much Importance to the united states and has So greatly, and So justly excited the public Attention, it is necessary that the most effectual Measures Should be Speedily taken, in order to obtain an impartial State of the Facts. To which End, We have the Honour to request of you, sir, to lay this Letter with the enclosed Copy, before your Assembly, if Sitting, if not, before the Council, for their Aid in procuring Evidence from Records and Witnesses, relative to the Several Objects of Inquiry, enumerated in the Resolution.  The Testimonies of Witnesses, Should be in Writing Subscribed by themselves, and authenticated in Such manner, as you shall think proper: their Places of abode also should be pointed out.  Justice to the Public, as well as to the officers whose Conduct is to be inquired into, requires, that all the Dispatch, which is consistent with the Nature of the Business, Should be made.

I hope it will arrive time enough for your sugar making business. I cou'd have procured the Sickles at 10/ & 12/ a peice, but the impossibility of conveying any thing from hence to Virginia at present, will oblige me to hold my hand, till I hear further from you.  Genl. Howe is now within 40 miles of us with his whole force, yet we are in good spirits having our Genl. & a spirited Army to oppose him. By the papers sent to Col.

  Dear Sir, Philada. Septr. 4th. 1777 I have seen letters from Cap McNeil to the Marine Committee wherein he blames Manly for some part of his Conduct, it was a great pity they did not push into some port with their Prize where the whole might have been manned & gone out fresh again, they wou'd have formed a Clever little squadron, however as that can not be, we must attend to what is in our power & if Thompson, Hinman, Jones & McNeill are not gone they will now receive orders to cross the Ocean, this point I carried yesterday in Committee & the orders will be sent immediately. (1) I am much engaged in winding up the Accounts of the Secret Committee & it will be a Herculean labour, & in order to do it compleatly I moved for a New Committee which was appointed & is Stiled the Commercial Committee who are to carry on the business in future. (2)They have chosen me Chair Man but I am very averse to engaging deeply in this New business untill the old is closed, & indeed I now wish to be released from public business totally. I have had a long SEPTEMBER 4, 1777  spell, my own affairs suffering amazingly the whole time & having no Ambition to gratify I wish to resign my honors & powers to somebody that may be better pleas'd with them. Whether I shall be permitted to retire or not I dont yet know, but the meeting of our assembly is at hand & I hope they will leave me out of the new appointments. The Commercial Committee agreed at their last meeting that it was better to lay by awhile as the Enemies Cruizers are too numerous on our Coasts for any thing to escape in the Summer Months, but I suppose they will commence some operations soon as hard Winds begin to blow. I shall want a vessell or two to load in Carolina or Georgia & wish you had told me the prices or terms of Charter. If you meet with any very good bargain of a vessell I wou'd either be concerned with you or wou'd wish a purchase on any Account for which you may draw on me with assurance that your bills shall be punctually paid, & you may dispatch her for Charles Town South Carolina Consigned to Mr. John Dorsius writing him to Load her with Rice for Havre de Grace Consd to Mr. Andw. Limozin, or if she cannot get into Charles Town she may go to Savannah in Georgia & apply to John Wereat Esqr. You may direct your letter to both those Gentn & they will comply with your orders as they have Funds of mine in hand. You may direct the Captain to go North about Scotland & keep well in with the Dutch & French Coast coming down to Havre. He must return to America with Salt.  Genl. Howe is preparing to disturb us but we hope to disapoint him. The Militia turn out with Spirit, they want arms but still we shall be able to Cope with him. Genl.

4155,dg007516,1777,Henry Laurens to John Lewis Gervais,"""Henry Laurens to John Lewis Gervais
  Dear Sir, 5th September. 1777. I sit down this Morning with a design to trouble you with a very long Letter, God knows whether I shall be permitted to accomplish. The Main body of the Enemy were within thirty Miles of us yesterday morning & about four or five from our Army. We expect every moment to hear of an important clashing, but what I think most probable, admitting General Howe to be so Strong as he is reported to be 18000 men or even 15 thousand, is, that he will keep General Washington at Bay with one part & March the other by a different route to this City. These & a thousand as Idle conjectures employ the conversation of Men at this distance. The time is big with fates, Somewhat very important will be brought forth before we are three days older. Congress has not yet determined to adjourn from this City but I am taking time by the forelock. James is gone to get the Horses Shod, will have our little All packed up to day & be ready for a March in case of need. Before the meeting of the House I will endeavour to say the needfull in reply to your very kind Letters of the 26th & 29th July. (1)  All that you had done or had intended to do respecting my Brother's affairs, appears to be extremely proper. The House in which Mr. McKay lives ought to be repaired. Mr. Motte should be at one half the expence & pay that half in Cash, but I doubt whether he will do so. He does not use my Brother well, he refuses to pay the Interest on his Bond under a pretence that my Brother receives the whole Rent of that House, although he knows the latter has not been for a considerable time past equal to the former & I have reason to beleive it never has been quite equal after deducting Repairs & Taxes. I wrote to my Brother on this head Some time ago; 'tis probable we shall hear from him. In the mean time Mr. Motte Should advance money for his part of the expence to be incurred by Repairs.  Betty is very troublesome & it appears by a memorandum of her Masters she has been always so. To hire her in a family will certainly be best. If she does not behave well in that Station & Ishmael still absent I think it will be best to send her in the Country. I believe while Ishmael was at home he maintained her & paid the principal part of her Wages. She is very Idle.  In a Letter which I wrote to you Somewhere on the Road to this place or perhaps since my arrival, I requested you not to part with  SEPTEMBER 5, 1777  the Gold, but to keep it as on my Accott. which I now repeat & I will improve it for my Brother agreeable to his desire by assigning him a proper Sum to be received in London. I shall be obliged by your opinion what the Exchange ought to be.  The circumstance of March at Wright's Savanna shocks & effects me exceedingly, nor is it less amazing because he was ever a man of placid & obliging disposition & always as far as I knew a good & faithful servant until he unhappily became connected with Mary. He has since that Union been guilty of Robbery. It was for such a Crime he was really shipped by Morgan. I am really grieved for the poor fellow. It appears to me best to send Mary to Georgia & order her to be Sold there, she has very great abilities & when she is cut off from her old acquaintance she may find it her Interest to exert them. If you will take the trouble to correspond with Mr Clay on this matter & he gives hopes of obtaining £200 Georgia Money for her, order her to be sent to him. As to March I think the mode of punishment which you propose is due to the public, otherwise from the reluctance I feel, I believe he would escape. When his wound is healed he must be kept at such work as he is capable of performing & from the necessity of the Case great rigour Should be exercised upon him until he gives proof of humility which will soon be, after he is Seperated from that wicked Devil.  Casper seems to be held in contempt by the Negroes & I am afraid of Some fatal accident. I shall write to him by this conveyance & submit my opinion to yours.  My Dear Sir, it makes me very unhappy to give you so much trouble as I am in my present circumstances obliged to do. It is extremely unreasonable in my Country Men to compel me to this useless Service, if they had only considered how much of my time had been devoted to theirs & how very little to my own affairs I think common gratitude would have induced them to give me a moments respite. Did they know how their delegates are now mis spending time I am sure they would recall them or give them very Special orders. Congress is not the respectable body which I expected to have found. To be particular on this point would be improper, but I mention so much from that feeling which is irresistible. I see my own private affairs going to Wreck, I am helping forward the heavy loss by most amazing expences here. I am adding to the load of trouble which my friends must have from attending to their own concerns & am rendering my Country no intrinsic Services. This latter consideration grieves me most. I think I have been instrumental in averting two pernicious schemes & except these my time 5 or 11 hours every day has been Squandred The most necessary work we have to do at present is that of Confederating-& that of making a State of past Expences, to be   fully informed of the application of those Millions already Issued to govern our future proceedings by wiser measures & to fill our exhausted Treasury by means least likely to involve us in difficulties. My attempts to accomplish these great purposes have hitherto proved fruitless & I have too much reason to fear, from a discovery of the cause, will ever prove so-unless very particular Instructions from some of the States should be charged upon their Delegates to demand of Congress an adjustment of Accounts. I wish we were half an hour together. I would say many things to you, as an Assembly Man, in favour of our little honest State. What I have Said you may think of in that Character but as being said to your Self only.  I have wandered into this digression of hints from a reflection which Suddenly took place in my mind, of the vast trouble which an attention to my business has already occasioned to you while I my Self am detained in a State of worse than Idleness. I shall write to the president requesting His Excellency to obtain leave for me to return to Charles Town if my health Should fail me as I fear it will when the Cold weather comes on. In such case even attempts to Serve must fail & therefore I request your aid if a question should be made in your House. Mr. Middleton will leave us in October. You should really send us two or three Men of business & Spirit, if I am to stay here, Maugre all the disadvantages that your absence from Carolina will work to my Estate I wish you may be one-but come who will the Assembly Should in common justice allow them to live at least half as well as they had been accustomed to at home & pay their bare expences. Pray what is the present allowance? I have lived in a very humble style compared with the humble style of Ansonburgh yet including travelling expences (not Carriage & Horses) have already nearly exhausted 2300 Dollars. Mr. Middleton tells me he lives upon public money & offered me a supply but I will have none, I never touched any in my life. Admitting General Howe is so complaisant as to allow us to remain here the Winter expences will be Still more enormous. Judge from this one item, James tells me I must pay four Dollars for a pair of Strong coarse Shoes for George, & this, paid a Taylor for making a Single coat. I found the Cloth 24 Dollars-every article in proportion but to return to your Letters from which I have strangely wandered, my mind is rended with Ideas which March out with all the regularity of Militia Soldiers. It is scarcely possible to make an exact arrangement when one expects every moment an alarm. James is now packing up in order to be in readiness for a move. I must go to the House of Idleness, Shall probably not see this table again till 4 or 5 oClock P.M. after having been witness to the transaction of business which would require no more than half an hour judiciously applied. I know where the defect lies & may tell you by & by. At 5 oClock I returned from Six hours Session  SEPTEMBER 5,1777  without doing one hours business. Took half an hour to dine & am now proceeding in this Address because at 7 I must attend a Committee upon a Wild Goose chase. (2) You see I am thoroughly out of humour, my Colleagues are not less so. I told you Mr. M[iddleton] is to leave us in October, Mr. H[eyward] says he will follow him in November. These are serious matters & demand the attention of Assemblies. For your own Sake do not leave the burthen of your whole State upon my insufficient abilities-but as I said a little while ago to return to your Letter.  As Bailey had not finished the business of my Georgia Estates the 9th July I should have been extremely glad to have heard from himself or Mr. Clay what progress he had made. The Georgia proclamation relative to our Chief Justice was a Secret to me before your intimation (3) & there was one published the 12 June relative to the forfeiture of the Lands in that State owned by Absentees which must have been a Secret to you the 29th July otherwise you would have Spoke to a matter of Such magnitude in my dwindling Estate.(4 ) I have written on the Subject very f ully to Mr. Clay (5) as you will see by my Letter to him which will accompany this & left undone flying Seal for your perusal & information. I commend the Subject to your attention requesting you wod do every thing in your power to ward off the impending unmerited attempt to rob me of near half my Estate.  If your House of Assembly is setting & you think it necessary you will apply for their interposition, in their recess I am sure the President will not refuse his utmost assistance & if nothing less will do than my personal appearance I beg you will obtain permission for me & transmit it with dispatch. I shall scarcely have a day to Spare, even if I should receive a return to this the 1st November.  Mr. W.B.(6) was formerly of a different opinion from that which you now intimate relative to the source of the Water at Wrights Savanna, but other Mens sentiments upon different views have also varied whence I conclude the fact requires a more full investigation than was entered into by those unkind neighbors who gave powers which would have been inconsistent with Law & justice even after the strictest scrutiny. James Brisbane holds those Lands near my plantation without any Titles from the Owners Messrs Wright nor has he ever paid one farthing of purchase Money.  My agreement with Gruber was £35. His additional claim of £10 is for assisting to conduct the Chariot from George Town, this part at least Mr. Heath was to pay but I think I made it a condition that he was to pay the whole if I purchased the Carriage. My memory will not furnish me with particulars but my Letters to Mr. Heath or your Self will testify. Soon however Gruber ought to be paid the £45, & by me rather than keep him longer out of his Money.  I owe Mr. Nephew something but dont know how much. Himself only is to blame that I remain in his debt. I had Money with me in March 1775 for cancelling his Account, he appointed a day to meet me at Boston Island, I waited for him one or I beleive two days extraordinary for no other purpose, but he did not come. There were some questions to be asked which would not have been pleasing to him-at my return to Charles Town I was ordered into the Chair of the General Committee, soon after into those of Genl Congress & Council of Safety. You know the burthen which the people laid on me how diligently I applied my whole time to public & how totally I neglected my private concerns, my Books & papers were in so disorderly a State when I left Mepkin I was ashamed to show them even to you. I have therefore no regular Idea of the State of Mr. Nepher's Account but there is among my papers the ground work for building a just & fair reckoning between us. I should be sorry to keep from him one farthing that is due & as I hope he will not demand more I shall have no objection to Mr. Clay's paying him on my Account Seventy Pounds Georgia Currency taking from him a proper Stipulation promising to account with me. I Say Georgia Currency because I beleive our agreement was so, if he Shews the contrary, then I would pay him £400 Carolina Money, I mean to do him complete Justice but I remember there are one or more large charges againt him & he will acknowledge the delay which has happened was owing to the disappointment above mentioned. I now recollect he was to have called on me on a Tuesday. I had intended to have left the Island on Wednesday or Thursday according to the arrival of an expected boat from Sunbury, but I did not leave it 'till Saturday.  Payment of Mr. McCulloghs order to Byers, of Parkinson's Note & Balance I believe are very right & so may be the 25 to Mamma Narvo. I dont exactly remember the Old Womans last version but judge your payment will fully cancel it to the midle of September, from whence her Stipend may recommence at 40/ per month. In the meantime I beg you will give her as from me £4 & shall I request you also to give to Mr. Joseph Roper Fifty Pounds & Twenty five pounds to Sam's Wife or if he has behaved well I would wish to add some indulgencies to bare necessaries for himself.  The prize which you mention to have been made by Seymour was an excellent favor of fortune, the more valuable by the Capture of so inveterate an Enemy as Lofthouse. As a rooted Enemy to our State & by no means from any resentment for his imprudence to me I hope you will not part with him before you obtain an adequate Exchange. Pray what is become of Bishop. If he is at large in Augustine 'tis high time he Should fulfill his promise of remitting by Gold or Bill the money I advanced for him of which he has the Account.   If Mr. Arthur comes here he will probably have cause to regret a fruitless journey. Your Letter to Fosdick is very good, but since Jimmy Debatt's marriage into the Noble family he is turned a Sad Rascal, if I had been at home I would have sold him & so I would Doctr. Cuffee & Montezuma, & I earnestly request you to do so by all or any of those Villains, ungrateful villains if they give farther cause for complaint. The two last mentioned, if they are not carefully watched & kept low will Slip further off than Wright's Savanna whenever an opportunity presents. If they know as much of my intentions towards them as I do, my Negroes would esteem a change of Masters to be the heaviest punishment that could be inflicted upon them.  I hope Mr. Clay will very Soon inform me the State of my affairs under his protection, therefore I do not trouble him on that Subject, nevertheless his long delay induces me to request you will acquaint me with all you can learn from Bailey or to procure from him a Letter.  I propose to leave all the Letters under your Cover open for your perusal. You will be so good as seal & cause them to be delivered as Soon as possible. One to Mr. Legare will shew you some thing of my poor James Air's Account. From those to Mr. Wereat & General McIntosh you will learn my Sentiments on the Georgia Land Act in addition to what I have Said to Mr Clay as well as on Colo G. M's Case. (7) The general has been very pathetic in a late Letter on this Subject, but concerning my Land he touches so Slightly I should not have understood his meaning without the aid of the other Gentleman who has taken a very friendly part. The little which my old friend has said seems to have been postulated more to impress upon my mind a harsh opinion of the prevailing party in Georgia than for my Service. In each of these Letters you will gather some fragments of intelligence, more you will collect from the News papers which will accompany them & upon Monday Morning when I intend to dispatch this Messenger you Shall be informed of every material branch of intelligence which shall in the mean time come to my knowledge relative to our Armies on Delaware, the middle & Northern departments.  I feel a Strong disinclination to plague you with minute directions on any parts of my Estate. I am confident you will give in general & in Special proper orders together with such attention as your health & leisure will admit of & I will prefer great losses to the cruelty of pressing an overload upon you, but what a load do you think I have been contriving & were you here, if it should from Love of the Cause we are engaged in even cost me two thousand Guineas, you should bear it, I am sure you would be requested to undertake it. It is necessary to recal Mr. Deane from the Court of Versailles, his conduct has not given Satisfaction. I do not know a man in America nor have we yet employed one according to my opinion so equal to the Task in all  respects as my friend Gervais. If you were here many an hundred pounds should I suffer by your absence from Charles Town, but I wish you were here.  We have had a little Skirmish between advanced posts. Baron Holzendorff this minute from Camp tells me one of our Generals misbehaved. The Enemy had Cannon, we had none, our Troops retreated. General Washington writes our loss is not very considerable; that of the Enemy he thinks was, from certain circumstances which he mentions & he is ever candid. The Baron whispers-\""Your Soldiers my Dear Colonel are very good Mans, so good as any brave Mans in the World, but your Officers my Dear Colonel your Officers\""-& then bursts his soft Laugh. I understand him & believe he is pretty just in his meaning. If we are put to the Block it will not originate in the Ranks. Here I left off at 1/2 past 10 Clock (the 6th) & went to Congress; am this moment returned 1/2 past 3. Five hours debating one Silly point whether certain persons chiefly Quakers who have given the Strongest proofs which in these times can be expected of their avowed attachment to the cause of our Enemies, who have peremptorily refused to take an Oath or affirmation of Allegiance to the State or to give a parol to the Executive power, should have a hearing in their own defence. The hearing which they aim at is not intended, but a hearing they may have, if they will accept the mode prescribed. Congress have recommended to the Executive Council to hear what they have to allege \""for removing Suspicion that they are Enemies to the Independence of the United States.\""(8)  I am much mistaken if by this shifting ground the Cry of persecution will not be raised to a tone higher, & that Congress & Council will eventually make ridiculous figures.  You will see either by this or the next opportunity a chain of publications on this affair. What other hearing can reasonably be required or granted when a Country is actually invaded, the Enemy within a few Miles of the Capital City, denouncing vengeance on the Rulers & principal Inhabitants of the State?-see Genl Howes late Declaration-but an honest explicit answer to a reasonable, fair & necessary question. Will you behave inoffensively in all respects & neither directly nor indirectly by Act or deed desire or work damage or injury to this State? Or, do you profess to owe allegiance to this State or to the King of Great Britain? Determine this affair as it may, the weakness of Congress will be marked, they Should have directed the measure in the first Instance or not have Submitted to be driven into it. This is an important question, if it shall be decided as there is too much reason to fear it will, Toryism will stalk triumphant & the first Assembly in America will be held in light esteem. If the Law of necessity will not justify us in the Act of confining notorious Enemies of the State when   that State is actually invaded, what shall we Say to the late Suspension of the Habeas Corpus in England not Invaded? To the denunciation of Military Execution by Genl Howe & General Jones in New York, or to the Rules prescribed in Burgoyne's Orders to Baum in general, & particularly for distinguishing the good & imprisoning such as Governor Skeen Should think bad? If the Quakers pretend to claim protection of the Laws of the Land, it should be remembred they refuse to obey those Laws & deny allegiance to the State? In a word while the British powers Seize & confine the persons of our Subjects or friends upon Suspicion & we suffer their professed friends to be at large & to go through all the Ceremonies & chicanery of Courts of Law in their defense, we proceed upon very unequal terms. We go without Arms, to War with determined & well appointed Armies. I am anxious for a determination of this great question.  It appears to me there was no ground for raising it. Are you not surprized at hearing that Congress has forgot her own Resolutions or will not exert powers which she has vested in all the States? You know Men have been Seized & confined because their going at large was judged by the Executive power to be dangerous to the State. A dangerous Rule I confess this would be in days of tranquility, but you well know it is absolutely necessary for the Safety of each State in our present Circumstances. But will you not be more Surprized when you reflect that the Gaols here are now full of prisoners Committed upon Suspicion, or for refusing to give their parol or to swear or affirm allegiance, nay that many have been put to death upon well-grounded suspicion only, of being Spies & yet that Congress should do & undo, determine & hesitate, Resolve & reconsider & Suppress the Resolve- when a few powerful Men called Quakers come to be the objects? No, you would not be surprized if you knew as much of certain affairs as I do. No Man has more Love for the Society of Quakers than I have, they are good friends, good neighbours, good Citizens in times of peace & tranquility & in time of War exceedingly useful in their own ways to the Side to which they are attached, but they are the most dangerous Enemies in the World. They now profess themselves to be \""real & true friends to America,\"" but read their testimonials particularly No. *(9) & No. & answer, are they friends to the Independence of the 13 United States? Are they friends to the Laws & Constitution whose protection they claim in the State of Philadelphia? Can there be more dangerous Inmates than Men who are in close correspondence with & giving intelligence, to the open Enemies of those with whom they dwell & to whom they outwardly profess Love & friendship? Can there be an instance produced of more refined insulting hyprocrisy than an artful declaration of Specious truth calculated to deceive? \""We profess Love & Friendship to you in our open Addresses, but in our Secret Testimonials  we declare the strongest attachment to your inveterate Enemies, we there call you unjust-tyrants usurpers of power & authority & we demonstrate that the true meaning of our Love & friendship for you is, Opposition to you, & an ardent desire that you may be Subdued by your Enemies who we know will imprison some of you, put others to death & confiscate your Estates & this you are also to understand to be the genuine interpretation of our professed, real friendship to America.\"" The Devil himself would be too honest, none but a thorough bred Jesuit would have the hardiness to call such duplicity \""that Wisdom from above which is first pure then peaceable, gentle & easy to be entreated, full of Mercy & good fruits, without partiality & without hyprocrisy\"" (Pemberton's Address 20 December 1776).(10) The calling God who is the fountain of truth, or the quoting his Holy Scriptures, which are the Oracles of Truth, to witness a Lie, or any Species of deceit is blasphemy. And to such men as we have in view it may very fairly be retorted \""they wrest the holy Scriptures to their own damnation.\""  I am sure you will not mistake me, that I mean to condemn the whole Society of Quakers. You are too well acquainted with my Maxim that I know no man by his Country or his Religious profession. No I am persuaded that every honest sensible Man in that Society will upon due reflection censure their Brethren & many will detest the principles of those double-minded leaders & their adherents. Sentiments Similar to these I have already heard from one speaking the language of others. To Speak in their Style, \""my mind being deeply impressed with a fervent & anxious concern for the honor of Congress & for the welfare & preservation of the 13 United Colonies in the true Spirit of Liberty & Independence I am constrained to impart to you this detail of an extraordinary occurence & to signify my apprehensions of ruin to our Cause, or much detriment to say the least, if these Crafty Men succeed in their present attempts. To put an end to the Subject at present & to hope for the best, the Council will determine with becoming spirit on Monday & Send these Seditious dangerous Men to a place where they will be deprived of the means of doing harm. But you will ask what ground I have for such hope when I know that we have in another instance even in this very day Jockeyed ourselves? Governor Penn & Chief Justice Chew as Kings Officers were ordered to be sent out of the State in case of Invasion & it was understood they were to go to Virginia where few Tories are & where they would have little influence & little opportunity of corresponding with the Enemy-the trust was reposed in the Board of War. The Board has ordered these Gentlemen, I should Say connived at their going, to Union Iron Works in Jersey, the property of William Allen Esquire a confirmed Enemy of our Independence two of whose apostate Sons are gone over to   General Howe & one or both of them in his Army, from whence they may safely correspond with & transmit plans to our Enemies all around. (1l) Is not this enough to make an honest man who has staked his Life & all on our side exclaim with faithful Mercutio, \""a pox on both your Houses\"" & wish he never had had any thing to do with such Citizens? Better never to have offended Mr P & Ch by the stigma of Imprisonment & banishment than to provoke them by the Act, & lose to the people the intended effect & benefits. I speak plainly to you General Washington's Life, his virtues are the only present proofs of our Cause. Should he drop Suddenly, I will not determine that so good a Cause would be lost but I cannot err in avering that we should undergo most violent convulsions. When I first arrived here I was told by way of caution that in Congress there were parties-I soon perceived there were. In the Short span of seven weeks I have discovered parties within parties, divisions & subdivisions to as great a possible extent as the number 35 (for we have never more together) will admit of. As it is wholly contrary to my genius & practice to hold with any of them as party, so I incur the censure of not being long with any. These will continue & the evil effects of them increase every day until we confederate & adjust Accounts & until we Resolve to banish & punish Luxury & to practice economy public & private suitable to the Circumstances of people whose means for Exports are almost all & will soon be totally, cut off, until we sift the chaff from the Corn, the Enemies from the friends of the United States, until we determine to depend more upon our Selves under the protection of God Almighty, than upon a Crafty designing Court, who never has done, & who never will do, any thing for our Interest but what has been or shall be subservient to their own & who by every Act has demonstrated a disposition to make Tools of us for promoting their own ends.  When we are driven by hard Strokes to virtuous frugality, to a firm dependence upon our own Strength, then we shall help our Selves, we shall be really & truly independent, then we shall receive offers of Service which we may accept or reject as dear bought wisdom shall dictate, but from our present proceedings & from all appearances we are yet to be reduced to the State of a Rudderless ship in a boistrous Ocean. What can be more affecting than to reflect, that our Congress were last Year so wanton, so young & incautious as to make propositions, very injudicious propositions, for a Treaty with France which that Court has betrayed to our Enemy but has not deigned to favour with an answer. Yes, there is something more affecting-the avidity of some Men (too many I fear from Selfish veiws) for borrowing unlimmitted Sums of money from that Court which will be to Sell your Soil & your selves into a worse State of dependence than that from which we are endeavouring to escape. Judge from certain authentic extracts.(12)  \""Our Treaty of Commerce is not yet proceeded upon. Their plan is not to have any transactions with us which shall acknowledge American Independency but to make us more easy they tell us we enjoy all the advantages which we propose by such a Treaty.\"" Strange.  \""Capt Cunningham is imprisoned at Dunkirk & the prizes which he took will be restored, this will serve to lull the British Ministry & then Cunningham & his Vessel will be released through favour, but we must put up with the loss of his prizes. This is a matter of Triumph to our Enemies which we Suffer them to enjoy for the present while we have the most Substantial proofs of the friendship of this Court & of Spain which will Soon be manifested to the World.\"" Substantial proofs indeed!  \""Feeling our Selves assisted in other respects we are induced to let them take their own time.\"" Aye! & their own time they will take!  \""Mr received the same professions of good Will at Madrid but was refused the Character of Ambassador or to be received or acknowledged openly.\"" Manifested to the World!  \""We applied for the naval aid you require & received a possitive refusal.\"" \""Also for the two Millions Sterling on Loan & was told it was im- possible to lend so large a Sum.\""-\""but are promised certain quarterly payments to make good the payment for Interest on 10 Millions of Dollars if you should borrow so many.\"" (I beleive it is extended even to the Interest of 20 Millions at 4 to 6 per Cent.) This may be in the whole about two hundred & seventy thousand pounds per Annum if we should borrow so much as 20 Millions Dollars per Annum. This of 20 Millions is grounded only upon \""we hope\"" how long any part of it is to last we have no assurance. The change of a minister would put an immediate Brake [. .](13) other demands which will absorb the greatest part if not the whole of the first intended grants for paying the Interest of the hoped for 20 million Dollars & farther that tis expected we shall enable the Court to collect by Duties in Tobacco which we have engaged to Send to the Farmers General, great part of the proposed Loan.\"" Immense friendship! Enable me, & I will lend you a Sum of Money. Will you believe it, upon this Slender Basis a bold attempt has been made to draw plumply & immediately for ten Million of Dollars, next for five Million; the former equals 22,250,000 Sterling, the latter 21,125,000. Did I say Slight basis? Are we not told in the Strongest language it is impossible to lend us any such Sum? Is this going hand over head? Is it governing 13 United States by random Strokes of policy? or did it spring from sinister motives? I cannot suspect the latter. Yet Such projects were the megrims of Men who hold themselves of the first rank & first importance in our political system. I told you I had been Instrumental in averting two pernicious schemes. This is one of the Instances. The other was a proposed mad expedition, (14) but I have not succeeded to my wish. Far   from it. By a Majority of one voice we have Resolved to draw on France at all hazards, Tobacco or no Tobacco or whether the fund may be exhausted by other demands or not, to draw I say for the Amount of Interest of all past & future loans.(15)  I cannot persuade Gentlemen to believe that Bills of Exchange on France bearing 6 per cent interest is a farther emission of paper Money, but so much more dangerous than an emission of Square Dollars by the Interest which will accumulate to be repaid abroad & thereby in effect mortgaging to a foreign Crafty power so much of our Soil. I cannot prevail upon them to beleive that if their Loan Certificates were made payble in one Year instead of three or five years & the Interest quarterly or half yearly, Money holders could be induced to lend more freely. I cannot prevail by my reasoning, to prove that either, from the tenour of their present loan Certificates or from the insufficiency of the Sums Emitted to answer the amazing circulation of paper Currency & also for a return into the public Funds arises the Slackness & deficiency of Loans. I beleive it arises chiefly from the former because there can be no man so Stupid, as to think Congress money in many Bills more permanent & secure by Iying in their Desks useless & Subject to many ordinary risques than it would be if it was comprised & expressed in one Certificate of Congress Money & bearing 6 per Cent Interest. (16) Neither can I prevail on Interested Men to acknowledge that 20 Millions of Expence per Annum all paid in ready Money whether the Expence be for Soldiers, Waggons & Rations or for Broad Cloth & Silk requires more money for circulating Currency than the expence of 8 or 10 millions per Annum-of which 7/8th at least was entered into Books not paid for in twelve or 18 months & even then not 1/3d paid for in Paper Money but in produce of the Ground- nor can I persuade such Men to own although they must know, that however hard they may Struggle & rant in order to accomplish impossibilities the Value of their paper Currency whether in Bills of Exchange hawked about in France or in Paper Dollars contemned in Philadelphia-But Market will continue to decrease until we can open our Ports & obtain a free exchange for the products of our Land. We may indeed find some temporary relief by Sale of Forfeitures within. What is worse than all I cannot prevail upon them to listen to the alarm-that going in debt to France how be it this may afford us present means & put our debt out of sight for a little while will be mortgaging our Soil, will induce that Court to persevere in her plan \"" to do no act which may seem to acknowledge our Independency,\""(17) will encourage the British Ministry to protract the War, will infallibly Create Jealousies & engender broils & divisions among the States & will in a very few years burst our Childish bubble of Independence. That from these awful considerations Wisdom dictated to us to draw upon  France for no more Money than is absolutely necessary to purchase & pay for articles essential to our defensive War. That we should contract our expences public & private, recommend Taxation in each Colony, borrow at home upon the best terms, clear the States of Enernies, Sell vacant & forfeited Tracts & other Estates, encourage manufactures, strive more ardently to improve our marine force & do a Thousand other things which we know to be necessary which we ought inunediately to engage in & which we would do, if Luxury & Avarice were discountenanced & banished. If we have not virtue enough to save our selves, easy access to the Treasury of France will only hasten our ruin. These Sir are very serious considerations. I have suffered much distress of mind on the occasion, I have been told that my arguments were very pretty for theoretic writers but I appeal to experience, it is from experience I draw my reasoning. I do not contend for a further Emission of paper Money, I wish to avoid it. I am sure we may avoid it if we please. I contend against the most dangerous of all Emissions drawing Bills on a foreign Court, but if we must emit for domestic purchases & Services, of two Evils I would choose the least. Many other arguments I have at different Stages introduced, too many to trouble you with, I hope my endeavors will be acceptable to my Constituents, I am void of understanding if my reasoning will not bear the test of experience & sound judgment. The subject is as farniliar to me & as clear as that Indigo in such circumstances as we have been reduced to for the three years past is a preferable Commodity for exportation to Rice & Lumber (uncommon Cases excepted). Had we been so wanton as to have drawn for 10 or 5 M[illion] Dollars, the purposes of those whom we have no reason to befriend might have been Served; Tories would have thrown back your paper money if they had any faith in your Bills of Exchange & taken leave of you, a few Merchants would have attempted to introduce a flood of French articles which we may & ought to do without. In fine we should have incurred a solid ponderous debt without the benefit of one Solid article in return. (l8)  ""

  Dear Sir Philadelphia Septr 7th 1777 I recievd your kind favour of the 1st Inst from Lebanon. Am rejoiced to hear my family are so well, son Thos. you say a little better. Mr Wales writes me much better near fit to join the Army. I hope his account may prove true being the most favourable but shall expect after you get to Windham to have in your Next a little more particular home Accounts than have had. I now Consider you as one of my family. What I have left at home, House, pastures, barn and any thing else is as free to you as the rest of my Children & would have you look upon it as much your home as you please till you think best to set up house keeping which shall leave with you & my daughter. Tho am concerned for furniture you know it grows worse & worse, believe we must not stand on Niceties at these times, hope all will come right by & by. I think Congress now are in a pretty good Temper to do business if this plaguy fellow of an How does not disturb us, we are now very Sulky and determine not to move for him if we can help it. How long our Courage may last I know not. It will not be strange if at this time it should exceed our Conduct. We feel very Magnanimous, but a few days may decide-before Hows appearance this way, our removal from this Venial City became a serious topick, & believe would have been the case had not G How appeard but you know we Scorn to fly. Confederation & finances are now the great Objects but ten thousand Necessaries are dayly Crouding in but there is no design nor Art in keeping it off. All are agreed in the Object, differ only in the proportion of Representation & taxation. You may say that is enough. True it is but I think we shall not break upon these; it will now soon be agitated. Supplying our Army securing & appreciating our Currency is now first attended to. France & Spain offer us money to pay the Intrest of all our Loan. Will not sure Bills on our Commisrs in France for the Intrest at 6 per cent in Specie make money Catchers fond of our Bills & eager to put them into the Loan Office on recieving their Intrest in Europe by bills of Excge drawn on our Commisrs. It would in fact be equal to 15 per Cent. For the present if you have any to put in you had best wait a few days for a decision for I yet know not whether that advantage will be given only as Incouragement to those who will now throw in their money into the Office as it may soon be wanted or shall SEPTEMBER 7, 1777  extend to those whose money we have allready got, I mean to past Loans.(1) For my part if this takes place I should think it my Intrest to sell the most of my landed Estates, ie, if it will sell high in proportion to other things and place Avails in the Loan Offices as am persuaded in a few years when these loans are paid of[f] the same money will buy more than double the land in Value & Quantity especially in the heart of our Country. Should be glad to hear Whether Lands rise & Whether there is still a demand. Mr. Webster offers me about 17 hund pounds for Scotland farm. Believe should Venture to take 2000. Hope you will soon write me a little particular of family & Affairs & when I had best come home &c &c. I have wrote to Benjn. once or twice telling him I could get some very necessary articles here in his way if he wanted them such as could send by a post.

  Dear Sir Philada. Sepr. 7th. [1777] I find by yours dated the 1st of this Month that you will probably be a little more stationary than you have been for many weeks back. Therefore I shall scratch something or other upon paper for you, at least weekly; as is my practice to others of the few in whom I intirely confide.  SEPTEMBER 7, 1777  I can excuse you, upon your first meeting with your lovely Amelia, for that descriptive Sketch which you have given me of your Happiness. But I charge you in future to avoid even Hints about dear domestic Joys. Consider that my Duty has fixed me in unsocial Philadelphia; and do not heedlessly make me the Victim of Envy which is its own severe Tormentor.  As to Journals-be persuaded that no Expence or Industry has been wanting on the Part of Congress to get them up to the present Time. The Flight of Printers & the Want of paper has impeded the Work till now, when we have a good prospect. We are up to Octr. 25th. and shall very shortly have the Year-76 in a Volume. (1)  When the main Army is at our Elbow, and while we are situated in the Capital of such a State as Pensylvania we shall never want ten thousand Interruptions to the Settlement of the Articles of Confederation & the Establishment of our Currency.  As to losing the Confidence of the people, I shall be sorry for their own Sakes; But, by Way of Scare Crow to an honest Heart, I value it as little as any other natural Phenomenon of Nature. There is a majority in every State of the Union, and in every great Assembly, which can be depended upon, at this Day; But there are also heavy Clogs in each. The Cause of the people is safe. But their Patience must have full Exercise. Virtuous themselves they cannot be ruined by their present Assailants.  Had there been due Vigour in this Government, Congress would not have been obliged to have pointed out Individuals of this State for Arrest. But the Safety of the Union called for it. And you may depend upon it every step we have taken can be handsomly defended. Freely did old Israel and the Tribe in general turn out armed when scandalous Oppression had stirred up the Paxton Boys. Read the hypocritical Cant of these Days. Hear the Appeal to the Freemen of Pensylvania, and Quotations from the Bill of Rights of this Independent State, from Wretches who will not affirm themselves faithful Subjects of it; and who since the Declaration of Independency complain, in the Registries of their rneetings of Sufferings, that they are forced to aid in a War against Government.  I will suppose Coll. Dyer has written on the Subject of giving a Spring to the Loan Offices, therefore I shall omit that Topic at this Time.  Before this reaches you, a Number of New England Shippers will be about you, who have left their Vessels at the Head of Elk. There has been a most horrid Delay in the Management of the Persons to whom they were consigned. I have written to Coll. Aylett (2) to desire he would confide the Settlement of his private Accounts as well as public to you so far as concerns the 6 Captains particularly Taylor my old Fellow prisoner & Perkins my half Land Lord. You can empower Tracy or   Deacon Smith to go through with it. The poor Fellows are heartsick of public Employ. They have about ruined themselves by their Late Tryal. Four in Five would have got to Boston long ago if they had been in private Service.  My Wife gives me a useful Account of the Scarcity of Bread, in Boston. How is it? artificial? Has it not been fruitful in the Eastern States? There is a vile Jewlike Struggle in every part; I wish Howe was nearer to his old pen in 42 Deg. 30' Latitude. Not indeed that I find he mends the People of this City by coming into their Neighbourhood. But he would have different materials to operate upon in my Country from what Quakers are constructed of.  You tell me you have nothing new. It cannot be long so with us. The Enemy's Fleet has fallen down Elk, our Genl. thinks it is to water at the mouth of Susquehannah. Time must discover. Though both Armies are exposed to the Fever & Ague, yet there is a great Difference to be expected in the Consequences. A Stranger with his Teeth chattering will think himself dowright sick. Our Countrymen will sweat off their Fever & go instantly upon Duty, as they have practised in regard to Field Labour. I close, Your affectionate Friend, J Lovell  ""

  My dear Philadelphia Monday Septr. 8. 1777 There has been a very general Apprehension, during the last Week that a general Action would happen, as on Yesterday. But We hear of none.  Our Army is incamped between Newport and White-Clay Creek on advantageous Ground. The General has harrangued his Army and published in General orders, in order to prepare their Minds for something great, and has held up the Example of Starks, Harkemer, Gansevoort and their Troops, to animate his Officers and Men with Emulation. Whether he expects to be attacked, or whether he designs to offend, I cant say.  A General Action which should terminate in a Defeat of How would be compleat and final Ruin to him, if it should terminate only in a drawn Battle, it would be the same Thing. If He should gain a Victory, and maintain Possession of the Field, he would loose so many Men killed and wounded, that he would scarcely have enough left to march  SEPTEMBER 8, 1777  to Philadelphia, surrounded as he would be with Militia, and the broken remains of the Continental Army.  But if there should be no general Battle, and the two Armies should lounge away the Remainder of the Campain, in silent Inactivity gazing at each other, Howes Reputation would be ruined in his own Country and in all Europe, and the Dread of him would cease in all America. The American mind, which I think has more Firmness now than it ever had before since this War begun, would acquire a Confidence and Strength, that all the Efforts of Great Britain afterwards would not be able to relax.  You will see by the Papers inclosed, that We have been obliged to attempt to humble the Pride of some Jesuits who call themselves Quakers, but who love Money and Land better than Liberty or Religion. The Hypocrites are endeavouring to raise the Cry of Persecution, and to give this Matter a religious Turn, but they cant succeed. The World knows them and their Communications. Actuated by a land jobbing Spirit, like that of William Penn, they have been soliciting Grants of immense Regions of Land on the Ohio. American Independence has disappointed them, which makes them hate it. Yet the Dastards dare not avow their Hatred to it, it seems. (1)  The Moments are critical here. We know not, but the next will bring Us an Account of a general Engagement begun-and when once begun We know not how it will end, for the Battle is not always to the strong. The Events of War are uncertain. All that We can do is to pray, as I do most devoutly, that We may be victorious-at least that We may not be vanquished. But if it should be the Will of Heaven that our Army should be defeated, our Artillery lost, our best Generals kill'd, and Philadelphia fall into Mr. Howes Hands, still America is not conquered. America would yet be possessed of great Resources, and capable of great Exertions. As Mankind would see. It may for what I know be the Design of Providence that this should be the Case. Because it would only lay the Foundations of American Independence deeper, and cement them stronger. It would cure Americans of their vicious and luxurious and effeminate Appetites, Passions and Habits, a more dangerous Army to American Liberty than Mr. Howes.  However, without the Loss of Philadelphia, We must be brought to an entire Renunciation of foreign Commodities, at least of West India produce. People are coming to this Resolution, very fast here. Loaf sugar at four dollars a Pound, Wine at Three Dollars a Bottle, &c. will soon introduce Economy in the Use of these Articles.  This Spirit of Economy would be more terrible to Great Britain, than any Thing else and it would make Us more respectable in the Eyes of all Europe.  Instead of acrimonious Altercations between Town and Country and between Farmer and Merchant, I wish, that my dear Countrymen  would agree in this Virtuous Resolution, of depending on themselves alone. Let them make salt, and live without sugar-and Rum.  I am grieved to hear of the Angry Contentions among you. That improvident Act, for limiting Prices, has done great Injury, and in my sincere Opinion if not repealed, will ruin the state, and introduce a civil War. I know not how unpopular, this sentiment may be: but it is sincerely mine. There are Rascally Upstarts in Trade I doubt not, who have made great Fortunes in a small Period, who are Monopolizing and oppressing. But how this can be avoided entirely I know not, but by disusing their Goods and letting them perish in their Hands.  ""

  Dear Sir, Swan Creek 8th Sept 1777. I beg the favor of you to forward the inclosed by the first Safe opportunity: my father will be anxious to hear from me.(1)  G. Smallwood writes to you by this opportunity & transmits a return of the militia here, their arms, ammunition, & accoutrements & I suppose will inform you he proposes to order the militia to rendevouze at Johnson's Ferry. The militia at this place will march tomorrow for that ferry. I shall proceed to head Quarters. No doubt you have better information from Mr. Jones of the enemys position & motions than I can collect at this out of the way place. Howe I hear is at Aithim's Tavern 5 miles from head of Elk. Col. Rumsey, who is now here, was Saturday at head of Elk & made some prisoners. Cornwallis is at Crouch's mills, Kniphausen at Fisher's mills, the last distant from Newark 3 miles. Poor Alexander is gone along with the enemy with all his Family. He can never remain in this country unless in the disagreeable situation of seeing it conquered by the enemy. If he has any virtue, this thought alone must pain him. Dr. H. Stevenson, it is said, cried like a child when he left his plantation in this neighbourhood. Unfortunate misguided men! G.W. made a speech (I am told by one Rogers who keeps Susquahanna Ferry) to his army which was recd with great applause. Officers & men desired to be led to battle. Washington is said to be at the head of 30 thousand men. I believe this number exaggerated by at least a third. I believe Gen. Smallwood does not intend to cross Susquahanna till he  SEPTEMBER 8, 1777  receives the feild pieces, at least not to proceed near the enemy. Gen. Washington I am sure will not hazard a general battle. We this day had a full view from stony point of the Enemy's fleet lying from the mouth of Elk to Sasafras, but chiefly about the mouth of Sasafras. If Mr. Smith should be desirous to return home, as it appears he is by a letter of his I this day saw written to Col. B. Rumsey, I shall proceed to Congress, & not return to join Smallwood's brigade of militia.(2) Indeed I already find this kind of sauntring life extremely disagreeable & fatiguing & hard lodging & irregular hours of eating begins to disagree with my puny constitution & habit of body; but perhaps I shall soon be more inured to & better able to support the fatigue of a campaign. I heartily wish you well & am yr. affectionate friend,  Ch. Carroll of Carrollton ""

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia Sept. 8th. 1777 I Recd. your favr. wrote in Kingstown Augst Wherein you say you were just returned from Springfield and the result of the Commissioners from the several states laid before Congress which we have Recd. but have not as yet acted on it.(1) The Avarice, Venality and disipation prevaling among all Ranks here in this quater and Increasing more & more in the Eastern states I fear it will be impractable to addop the Measures Recomended by your Committee, altho I think with you that it is Very Alerming and fear it will be Attended with Very ill consequences. As to the support of the Credit of our Money I can conceive of but two ways. First our Commisrs. in France & Spain has procured for us a loan to pay the Interest of all the Money we shall borrow by our loan office certificates at the rate of five livers France for every Dollar Interest which we sopose will give great encourragement to the Monied Men to lend the United States. The Other is that all the States go Immediately into large Taxation by which Means we shall be able to pay our Armey &c but if those two Measures should fail and we are obliged to Emit more Money (which I hope that wont be the case ), it will sink it Very low indeed. As to the Northern affairs they have been Very Alerming but at present through SEPTEMBER 8, 1777  the Goodness of God I trust they are at present Very favourable. You'l see more perticuler by the News papers and that Congress has adopted measures for Inquirry in that Affair. We Could have wished Borgoyne had pushed his armey lower down then he has that we might have marched an Armey in his Rear as well to Attack him in the front, we hope however that our brave Starke will be able to perform the former wile Genl. Gates attacks their front. Genl. Howes armey is some weare nigh Caskeen bridge, and Genl.

4166,dg007527,1777,Henry Laurens to John Lewis Gervais,"""Henry Laurens to John Lewis Gervais
  [September 8, 1777] It is now Monday Morning the 8th. We have nothing yet from the Camp except that both Armies seemed to be preparing for Serious Action. General Washington had approached the Enemy within three or four miles of Contact, had issued a very sensible animating public order a Copy of which I have seen & will endeavor to send you, (1) by this it would seem as if he meant to attack. General Howe on the other hand has sent on board the fleet all his Sick & wounded & ordered as [of] the 6th Inst four days provision to be Issued. This comes by a deserter who came in to General Washington yesterday morning, if this be true Mr. Howe expects to dine here on Wednesday, I hope we shall disappoint Sir William here as we did Sir Peter at Charles Town. The wounded arrived from the Skirmish the other day in which some of the  SEPTEMBER 8, 1777  lower County Militia behaved Infamously, threw down their Guns & fled without stopping till they got home, but others made great amends & the Enemy altho they had Cannon & we had none suffered exceedingly. Colo. Martin of North Carolina & his Regimt have gained glory in that affair. I say as I have nothing new from the Camp I will trouble you a little further on the Subject which I droped the 6th. (2)  It was said, \""many people hold Congress money to purchase Lands & other bargains or would even lend it at a low Interest to private persons in preference to putting it into the Loan Offices.\"" Answer, admit these to be facts-what is proved, but that there is a circulation for money either by purchases or by Loans, & that there are some people who have as good an opinion of Congress money as to Exchange Land for it & some who have opportunities of improving it in different ways otherwise they would not borrow, & the loans to them being at a low interest prove these to be men of substance.  Again, \""Many people will not take Congress Money who will by some means or other find Money to purchase Bills & fill your Loan office.\"" Granted, but who are these people? Surely our freinds do not refuse to take Congress money, & shall we Involve the States in a debt which may involve their ruin in order to accomodate our Enemies? But is it certain that Tories who will not Credit us here at home where there is a Stamina, will take our paper money Payable in a Country where we have no foundation?  \""But it has been the practice of all Nations to borrow\""; true when necessity obliged them, & so far & no further, I consent now to borrow. But so extremely cautious wise nations have been of borrowing from other powers, so jealous even of a Balance of Trade against them has Great Britain been, that they broke off connexion with France & Submitted to drink muddy port instead of sparkling Champaign & brilliant Claret.  \""But Great Britain owes now about 40 Million to the States of Holland for money borrowed.\"" This lies on you to prove, but I believe I may safely deny it. The Dutch subjects I will grant have money in the British Loans, I dont know to what amount perhaps six or eight Millions, so have the subjects of other States as Individuals. But if nations have been accustomed to borrow of other Nations have they not given security? Did not Holland put some of her Port Towns into the hands of the Queen of England! Did not Prussia Mortgage Selissia for the Credit established in London? Which of the United States will you put into the hands of France as guarantee for the Sums intended to be borrowed. But why will you borrow when by a reassumption of that Virtue which we boasted of & dropped in the same year, you may go on & Succeed without borrowing?  \""But France asks us no Guarantee, she offers to lend without any Security & when we are in her debt it will be her Interest to Support  us.\"" True she has as yet Courted us to take trifling Sums & magnified \""The K______ s generosity\"" in demanding no Security. She has also told us it is impossible to let us have the trifling Sum of two Millions Sterling. How long shall we remain free from a demand for guarantee? Can anyone answer? If it will be consistent with the Interest of France to Support us when we are in her debt, it will be equally consistent with her Interest & her practice too to send a few Men of War, Troops & Officers into one or more of our ports to protect us from insults from our old Enemies & at the same time to collect the Revenues due for the Loans. We have a recent proof of the Value France has put upon our Lands in our present Circumstances a \""Livre or 10 1/2 d. Sterling per Acre\"". What folly, what madness will it be to involve our selves in debt to that power. We should at least refrain until we have Resolved upon the Port for the reception of the French Men of War.  I compare our present attempt to the folly of a Young Man borrowing money from a designing Sharper upon the Credit of an expected Heirship. We are unwary & love ease & pleasure, we will borrow because it will save trouble. France pleads poverty in order to enhance the favor-will lend as much as she can (if you will enable her) & asks no Security. This magnifies the Royal & National Generosity. To whom are these manifique Offers proposed? To free & Independent States? No. To puppets whom she keeps behind the Curtain, to Squeak her purposes, for tis her plan \""to do no Act which shall seem to acknowledge our Independency.\"" She will not openly receive our Agents. Her Minister tells them \""it will be well taken if they communicate with no other persons about the Court but himself, that he will at all convenient Seasons be ready to confer with them.\"" They treat our Agents \""with all Civility but are cautious of giving Umbrage to England.\""  \""They (the French Ministry) take every Step to gratify England publickly-attend to their Remonstrances, forbid Ships with Military Stores for America to depart, recal leave of absence to their Officers going out to America & in presence of the British Minister give Strict Orders that American Prizes should not be sold in France, At the same time all these things are nevertheless done & they assure us (American Agents) of their good Will.\"" (3) Can there be Stronger proofs adduced of French dissimulation & American Puppetism?  Would wise Men, would the Guardians of thirteen Orphan States incautiously trust their Wards in the power of such a Court? If you profusely borrow from her you will, you must be in her power. I tremble at the prospect. I would almost rather return to Subjection to England, but I would surely rather recall our Agents than Submit any longer to such Insults. France will not for her own Interest let you go back to England. Be Virtuous, She will also for her own Interest Seek you, she will continue to supply you with every thing needful & to keep her ports   open to your Ships. In a little time such virtuous Resolution will render you Independent both of France & England. I must have tired you good Sir & yet I have not minuted here one half that I thought myself obliged to say & repeat upon this important business in the Course of 5 or 6 days debate & adjournment. Many good men see into the danger of contracting a debt with France but they do not see clearly. They say \""what shall we do, the Treasury is Empty.\"" This shews our Error in having neglected so long a business which is one of the main pillars of our Independence. It shews our folly too in the wanton terms proposed for Treaty last year-there the Court of Versailles has again made puppets of us & treated us with the Contempt we deserved. God Grant Mr. Washington, that brave & virtuous, that disinterested, Patriotic Hero, success in a Conflict which is probably now in agitation & we shall have further time to retrospect our proceedings & to mend what shall appear to have been amiss. If he fails a New Scene will open. Nothing but virtue then can Save us. We never shall call in her aid until we feel Severe distress. Tis time to attend Congress, maybe when I return I may tell you more of the Quaker affair & trouble you with another Sheet, but before I go let me suggest a danger which we seem to be drawn into. A whole week is passed & nothing is said or done further for replenishing our Treasury, if the proper means are neglected until that is nearly or more nearly exhausted, we may be frighted into a measure big with ruin, that of drawing for five or ten Million Dollars for doing which we have neither permission nor encouragement. If this shall happen remember I have foretold it to you & other my Constituents who are concerned in the event.  I am happy in having Mr. Middleton exactly coincide in Sentiments with me altho he has not spoke to the point. Mr. H[eyward] differs but I would not have it taken notice of for whatever his opinions may be, he is a Man of Candour & Integrity & I wish not to name any Body.  9th September. I did not return from business yesterday till the Sun had Set, eat a Scanty dinner & was obliged to go out again upon business. When I came home I felt a much stronger propensity for the Bed than the writing Table. It was mortifying to sit from 11 oClock to 1/2 past 6 without respite, spend four hours of that time wrangling a point which I think had employed us five days before-receive & pocket a well timed & spiritted reprimand from the Council & end the business relative to the Quakers & other self disaffected, where it might have been ended & in the manner in which it ought to have been ended in five minutes from the very outset, by recommending to confine at an appointed place Stanton in Virginia, all the mischeivous & active ones who shall refuse to take the Oath or affirmation of Allegiance to the State. I will not say the business is quite ended, for  as the Council feel or rather express themselves as if they were chaffed by our conduct, it may be they will have nothing further to do in it.(4)  These are weighty Considerations. Every weak, every impolitic step in Congress tends to lower it in the Esteem of the World, to sink its power & influence & to strengthen the hand & hopes of our Enemies abroad & at home. Many such steps are taken which the World do not know of. Those which are the subject of public canvassing make a rapid progress to our detriment. Observe among other reasons given in the House of Commons by Ld Geo Germaine for continuing the War in America he gives particularly this one-\""that he had further formed his opinion from the circumstance of the Congress having given up the Government confessing themselves unequal to it & creating Mr. Washington dictator of America.\"" (5) London May 16th. In the same speech he remarks on our Liberality giving the British West India Islands to the French, a foolish project which our Auctioneer friend must have betrayed & asked who will bid more? If people in America are once impressed with an opinion that Congress is inadequate to the business of Government, this Assembly will be presently blown up & our circumstances will become deplorable. I must observe that no part of the blunders or misconducts which I have been Witness to are chargeable upon the Men of business & plain good understanding. One bold patriot with few hairs on his Chin & endless fun & joke in his Brain, who boasts much of his knowledge in Law & Logic, who delights to discountenance a modest man & to baffle reason by ridicule, Strove as ardently to involve us in a serious quarrel with the Executive Council in this moment of danger as he did to plunge us into an enormous debt to France. Thank God we have hitherto repulsed him in both attacks. You will be again surprized when I tell you that during the important debates on the Subjects of borrowing money & removing Enemies from our bosoms we have Seldom seen more than twenty members upon the floor, & more than once, business has been interrupted by want of Members (9 States) to make a Congress. I may add to \""weighty\"" that these are melancholy considerations. The Evil demands attention from the Several States-there must be a thorough Renovation. I can do you no good here. I am wasting time to no good purpose.  I am persuaded you will make the best use you can of these intimations, you may depend upon it I have neither by word or energy misrepresented any fact, I have Spoken pretty freely to His Excellency the President. Mr. Middleton I beleive has delivered his Sentiments & will deliver them very fully when he returns, but I Speak more to your Self in the Character of one of my Representative Constituents. I wish what I have said may be useful. I hold it dangerous that the public Should know our \""Infirmity\"" as it was yesterday properly termed in debate by my Colleague last mentioned.  I beleive I shall scarcely have time to write by this opportunity to  Mr Manigault. You will be so good as to present me to him & to Mrs. Manigault in the most cordial terms. I beleive the good old Gentleman will not differ in opinion with me on the Subject of depending on or going wantonly in debt to the French. He will pity as I sincerely do the State of all people of quiet peaceable dispositions among the Quakers who no doubt are greatly distressed for the present Circumstances of their turbulent friends, for although many of them censure the Pembertons & others for having indiscreetly as they say interfered with affairs of State, yet they have deep feelings & many are apprehensive the Stroke may be aimed at their whole Society, this is not by any means intended.  I have not heard from Mr. John Laurens since the 31st August. He keeps close to duty with the General whom he greatly admires.  The Enemy at New York & Staten Island threaten to return the late compliment by General Sullivan on a visit to the Jerseys which is at present undefended except by their own Militia, these lie scattered & Estates & persons may be much injured before a respectable body can be collected & whereever the Enemy prevail they lay all waste & commit horrible Cruelties on the Inhabitants especially on the Women.  We have Submitted to General Washington for the propriety of ordering three Thousand Men from Peeks Kill for the protection of Jersey or for forming a Corps de reserve for enabling him in case of need to give second battle to General Howe's Troops.(6) It is said from Camp that General Howe has with the Sick & wounded embarked his Baggage & Tents, his Army retired a little way & Camped in Bowers on & near Iron Hill. If this be true the fleet will soon reappear in Delaware. I must now go again to Congress, when I return or early to morrow Morning will close this very long Epistle. We are more than three days older yet nothing extraordinary is brought forth so vain are all our conjectures.  Just returned from Congress 4 oClock. I cannot sit to dinner before I disburthen my mind by giving you a further Idea of our Confused proceedings.  I have been Witness to a Report made by a Committee of the whole, which had been entered upon the Journal, Superceeded by a new Resolution even without reference to the Report. A Resolution carried almost nem con-entered, & half an hour after reconsidered & expunged.(7) When I add that such irregularity is the work of almost every day, you will not wonder that I wish to be any where but in Congress.  The great question upon borrowing Money & paying in Bills upon France for the Annual Interest at 6 per Cent was this morning confirmed which if our Bills are accepted is meant to involve us further at least Two hundred & Seventy thousand pounds Sterling per Annum in a debt to France. 21 Yeas against 5 Nay. The Nays Colo Harrison,  Mr. John Adams, Mr. Duane, Mr. Middleton, Mr. Laurens. A very thin house for deciding the fate of America-time will Shew who are in the right.(8) £27000 Sterling per Annum. I Should have added besides the disadvantage of Remittances & besides vast other debt, but we have now temporary access to Money we shall continue to squander until we receive some very severe Check. This may possibly be within 48 hours for we this moment learn by express that Genl Howe has Stolen a march upon our great General He must be stopped this night or tomorrow morning he will be on our Skirts. We are all now talking of adjourning to the Country. The question is, where?  I take up another sheet chiefly with a design to ask your pardon for this long detaining you & to conclude. If any thing momentous or any thing worth your notice comes to pass before I seal it shall be added in a Postscript. This had been intended by an Express Messenger, my Colleagues judge it proper to detain him a few days. It will therefore go by the hands of Doctor Houston of Savanna.  Adieu. My Compliments to Mrs. Gervais & best wishes to the Little folks & all of you. I am with great regard & affection &ca (9)  ""

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia 8th Septr. 1777 Nothing new hath happened that we know of since my last. But it seems extremely probable that a general engagement will take place  SEPTEMBER 8, 1777  in a day or two between the American Army and Gen. Howe. The Quaker m[otto] ought to be \""Nos turba sumus\"" for if you attack one, the whole Society is roused. You will see by the inclosed Testimonies a uniform, fixed enmity to American measures, which with the universal ill fame of some capital persons, has occasioned the arrest of old Pemberton and several others, to prevent their mischievous interposition in favor of the enemy at this critical moment when the enemies army is on its way here, with professed design to give this City up to the pillage of the soldiery. They have taken infinite pains, according to custom, to move heaven and earth in their favor, and have transmitted copies of their indecent remonstrances over the Country. Congress have, to prevent ill impressions, ordered their several inimical Testimonies to be published in one Handbill. Altho nothing can be more certain than that Allegiance & protection are reciprocal duties, yet these Men have the assurance to call for the protection of those laws and that government, which they expressly disclaim and refuse to give any evidence of their Allegiance to. There is no doubt but that they will endeavor by means of the \""Friends\"" in Virginia to make disturbance and raise discontent there, but this may serve to put you on your guard. We understand that Gen. Howe has put all his heavy baggage and even his Tents on board ship and that all his fleet except a few Ships of war have fallen down to the mouth of Sassafrass, and many of them gone down the Bay. The Army has three or 4 days victuals cooked and by all their Manccuvres it seems clear that they mean to urge their way to this place. Gen. Washington is within 6 miles of their main Body and determined not to remove without a battle. By your letter of the 30th last it would seem that you have not received many letters from me that I have written, not one post since my arrival here on the 12 of August having gone without a letter to you with all the material news, besides one by Express. It is realy discouraging to write so much as I do having so little time, and yet my friends not receive my letters. This day Congress have proposed that the Quaker Tories should be sent forthwith to Stanton in Augusta, I hope you will have them well secured there for they are mischievous people. Should Howe be disappointed here, as it seems very likely that he will, it is more than probable that he will endeavor to do us all the injury in his power as he returns, and therefore it will be wise to be as well prepared for him as possible. I am dear Sir most affectionately yours Richard Henry Lee  P.S.

Septr. 10th. 1777 The great Desire of Congress to be informed of the Movements and Positions of the two Armies as early as possible, at this critical and important Period, has induced them to pass the enclosed Resolve, to which I shall only refer your Attention.(1)  Your Favour of yesterday I was honoured with last Night.(2)  With warmest Wishes, that Victory and Success may attend you, and that the Campaign may terminate in such a Manner as to encrease your Fame and Glory, I have the Honour to be, with the greatest Respect, Sir, your most obed Servt.3 John Hancock Presidt  ""

  Dear Sir, 10th September 1777. I had the honour of writing to Your Excellency the 12 & 15 August by Colo. Sumpter.  A very important question varied in different branches of borrowing Money from the Court of France has been Since agitated in Congress, I have been uniformly against the measure & think it my duty by the earliest opportunity to inform Your Excellency the grounds of my dissent.  The first question was for drawing Bills on our Commissioners for Ten Millions Dollars-which passed in the Negative.  A proposition was then made & a question put for drawing for five Millions of Dollars-passed also in the negative.  Yesterday by the most extraordinary motion & irregular proceeding that I have ever been Witness to in any other Assembly a Question was carried for drawing Bills of Exchange on our Commissioners at the rate of 5 Livres of France for a Spanish Dollar for payment of Interest at 6 per Cent per Annum of all Money already brought into the Loan office & that shall be brought in before the 1st March next.(1)  It is expected that upon this encouragement Money holders will bring Supplies to the Loan Office & that we may without another Emission of paper raise before the 1st March 20 million Dollars, the Annual Interest of which will be about £270000 Sterling besides the risques of loss & delay by Remittances.  'Tis true the Commissioners have given Congress assurance of Money received & promised Sufficient to pay the Interest of five Million Dollars annually & added \""we hope\"" also to find Sufficient by subsidies to pay the Interest of 20 Million if we should be obliged to borrow that Sum. At the Same time they inform us, that upon application to the Court of France to borrow two Million Sterling they were told it was \""impossible\"" to Spare Such a Sum. That they had been Strongly pressed & that the Minister was \""anxious\"" to contract for the delivery of 20,000 Hogsheads of Tobacco as a ground for raising Money by Taxes. That they had actually engaged to deliver 4000 Hogsheads & had received a very considerable advance on the Stipulation & \""earnestly intreat\"" Congress to enable them to comply with their part of the agreement, which while our ports are Stopped will be impossible.(2)  SEPTEMBER 10, 1777  It appears to me that the foundation for drawing Bills is not Substantial, the practice dangerous & the measure except for articles absolutely requisite for carrying on our defensive War not necessary.  The Commissioners Speak possitively of Money advanced & expected by periodical payments only for payment of the Interest of five Millions, which Sum & a much larger I apprehend will be consumed by a variety of other demands on them, which 'tis impossible from our mode of transacting business & our total ignorance of the public debt contracted & increasing, to form an Estimate of. This forbids in the Strongest terms the Act of borrowing Money abroad. They say in a Subsequent dispatch that we may rely on punctual payment of Congress-Bills drawn for the discharge of the Interest of Sums borrowed, but refer I apprehend only to the Five Million Per Annum & here they recommend that the Interest should be reduced to 5 or 4 per Cent, (3) but Congress upon a question confirmed 6 per Cent against 5 & have put former loans upon a level with such as may be hereafter made. (4)  The Court of France on failure on our part of the Contract for Tobacco, our continued demands on them for Money, for Ship building, Cloths, Arms & many other articles will have ground for Complaint & may make a pretext of failure on our side for withholding further payments to the Commissioners.  The drawing Bills of Exchange is to all intents & purposes emissions of Paper Money upon the very worst terms aggravated by 6 per Cent per Annum to be discharged under all disadvantages in a foreign Country, it is putting our debt out of Sight for a little time but it will infallibly return upon us with accumulated force.  Although France has peremptorily told us it is impossible to lend us two Million Sterling we are hastening to make a demand for that & for aught we know a much larger Sum.  The seeming temporary relief which we shall receive by draughts upon France will draw off our attention from enquiring deeply into the State of our funds & debts & lull us in our present alarming course of extravagance.  We should pay proper regard to the conduct of the Court of Versailles, in refusing to receive our Commissioners openly in their Ambassadorial Character, in \""avoiding every act which should seem to acknowledge our Independence,\"" in \""refusing possitively\"" the Naval Aid which we had applied for, in neglecting to consider or give any answer to our plan for a Treaty & in betraying part of our proposals & possibly the whole of them to the British Ambassador, in a taunting Sarcastical remark to one of our Commissioners that we had not bid high enough, in Imprisoning one of our Captains, Seizing his Vessel, ordering a restitution of his prizes & in a word in carefully avoiding to give \""umbrage\"" to the English.  To borrow Money from a foreign power is to Mortgage our Soil.  That the boasted generousity of the K of F. in feeding us lightly & demanding no Security, is, when compared with the conduct abovementioned liable to suspicion of being insidious. It will be the Interest of the French Minister to ensnare us by degrees into a considerable debt & the knowledge of the Negotiation will be a Strong incentive to the British for protracting the War.  That by altering the tenor of our Loan Certificates making the payment of Capital at one instead of three Years & of Interest quarterly or half yearly, Money holders would be induced to bring Supplies into the Office-that the expectation which the public have been held in of an emission of Bills of Exchange for 5 or 10 million of Dollars had been no small impediment.  When the loan Office Certificates are put on a beneficial plan, if Money shall not be brought in Sums equal to the public exigency, it will be a proof that past emissions are not excessive. The demand for Money at this time is not confined to the Capital Towns & Cities & within a Small Circle of Trading Merchants, but spread over a surface of 1600 Miles in length & three hundred broad nor is it now the practice to give Credit for one & more years for 7/8th of the whole traffic. Every Man is a Moneyholder & every article is paid for in Cash. It is hence obvious that an immense Sum is necessary for a compleat circulation. No Man would be so void of understanding as to keep Continental Bills Idle & at a risque of loss in his Desk when he might upon the Same Security improve them at 6 per Cent per Annum.  The Sudden rise of price for domestic necessaries of Life is not wholly owing to great Emissions of paper, but in fact principally to the total Stoppage of Imports & the consequent Scarceness & dearness of such articles as our real wants cannot, & too many which our Luxury will not forego.  Borrowing of a foreign power will not increase the value of our paper Money, it may & probably will be the source of extending the depreciation to several years beyond the term when we might if we were in debt at home only have redeem'd it.  Such & many other arguments I used upon this occasion particularly recommending Taxation & the most vigorous exertions for opening our Ports & promoting exportation. I had the mortification to fail in my endeavors. The question being put & the yeas & Nays demanded there appeared 21 yeas & 5, Colo. Harrison, Mr. Jno. Adams, Mr. Duane, Mr. Middleton, Mr. Laurens, Nays. If I have erred in my attempts it is fortunate for my Country that I have done no harm, but the measure appears to me big with danger & as I am apprehensive a further attempt may be made to draw for some Capital Sum on the Commissioners I request to be instructed by Your Excellency whether to consent or protest.  I beg your Excellency's pardon for having delivered my Self on  this important Subject so unconnectedly, but I am reduced to a very short Space for writing, my Colleagues have intended to have sent our dispatches as tomorrow by an express Messenger. We have now determined to stay him till we learn the event of an approaching general battle between our Army & the British now very near each other & within thirty Miles of this City. I intend this by the hand of Doctor Houston who waits for it. I shall inclose half a dozen News papers & refer to them for past intelligence & add only that I am with great regard & esteem &ca.  P.S. Casting my Eye upon the Resolve I perceive the time for bringing Money into the Loan office on the terms above mentioned Stands unlimited. The Report of a Committee of the whole House had Limitted 1st March which was passed over without a question so very irregularly do we transact business every day. This Resolution being made known in our State will give an opportunity to our people to prepare for partaking the proposed benefit if they choose to lend.(5)  ""

The above is confirmed.  We have heard Nothing of Genl. Smallwood or Gist since they left this City.  Our Resolve to pay the Interest in Bills will bring Us Money, if any thing will do it.

  Dear Sir Philadelphia, Septr 12th 1777 The last Accounts I gave you of the two great Contending Armies this way was that Genll How had left the head of Elk & had Marched for this City sending his Ships down Cheesepeak Bay supposed with a SEPTEMBER 12, 1777  design to have them come round to this, that he had Cast the die & put all at Hazard upon his Success & that the two Armies were near togeather not far from Willmington parted by the River Brandywine where was a pass way over a Bridge near Willmington, & a ford way about 12 miles farther up in the Country. After This Genll Washington passd with his Army over the bridge to meet the Enemy, formed a line of Battle waiting for Hows Attack which for that day was hourly expected but it seems Howe declined, & in the Night after (Wednesday) stole a March up the river towards Chads ford on which Genll Washington repassed the Bridge & pushed up on this side the river towards the same ford where he Arrived just at time enough to oppose How in his passing that Ford where a sharp Cannonading insued on each side. During this, How sent a part of his Army about 6 miles above where was another ford way. For fear of this Genll Washington ordered Genll Sullivan towards that Ford & to watch the motions of the enemy, but Sullivan having false Intelligence from a Country man, that the Enemy were not passing that way which he sent back to Genll Washington which prevented him sending the reinforcement Intended, & thereby the Enemy passed that ford without any body to oppose them & was in their full March to flank our Army. Genll Sullivan by the sudden appearence of the Enemy had not time to form in the best manner, & before he was reinforced His division was thrown into Confusion, the reinforcements coming in rather in small parties tho they faught with utmost bravery yet were overpowered with Numbers were oblidged to give way. To Support them Genll Washington was oblidged to Weaken his force opposing the Enemy at Chads ford by which means the Enemy at length forced their passage through that & our Army were oblidged to retreat from the ground being thrown into Considerable Confusion. The greater part of this day was taken up in very severe Attacks & very heavy & sharp firing. Our loss is Computed from 400 to a thousand. It is said & affirmed by most, that the Enemy have lost more than double the Number. Our Army were oblidged to retreat to Chester & were coming in from their dispersions this day. At the same time the less fatigued part of our Army are on the way to the Schuylkill & now at Evening some divisions have passed it against this City & are moving up towards German Town. The Enemy by the best accounts have lain still this day to bury their Dead, to take care of their wounded &c but are expected very soon to Move & supposed to pass Schuylkill about 15 miles above this City at a smooth shallow ford way there called Sweeds ford. Genll Washington is bringing over his Army this side by a bridge against this City & moving up to oppose him & Another Battle is very soon expected which most likely will decide the fate of this City or of Genll Hows Army. We wish Providence might order a delay for 2 or 3 days for some reinforcements coming in from the Jerseys & a body of Troops from Maryland & from   that quarter who are now on their way, & will soon be close on Genll Hows rear. We fear but do not despair. We were too self Confident before the late disaster. That has given a little seriousness & hope may direct us Heaven ward for Help & that before I finish this letter a kind Providence will Interpose for us and that I may close it with giving you a more favourable Account of our Aflfairs.  Saturday Evening. I had no design of finishing my Narrative in two or three days expecting something further material would happen before that time but Morris calling upon me this Evening going out very early in the Morning must Close it with only mentioning that we expected Genll How would have pushed on rapidly for this City, but we find his Victory has cost him so dear that he has been Willing to lye still to this time, has sent in a flag to Genll Washington requesting protection for a Hospital for [His?] Wounded which we learn amounts to 18 hundred.(1) What answer Genll Washington has given him am not yet Informed. Our Army are much fatigued but not at all discouraged but on the Contrary are said to be very alert & in high spirits. We hope for rest two or 3 days when we expect 3 or 4000 Jersey Militia. Tho this City were thrown into great Consternation on finding the retreat of our Army before the Enemy but their Spirits now revive and they are turning out Militia & Volunteers to join Genll Washington, & now instead of Genll Hows making for the City we begin to Imagine he will return to Willmington & wait for a reinforcement from New York & Rhode Island which we hear he sent for sometime agoe as also for his shipping up this river, but all is Uncertain at present. Genll Washington has again repassed the Schuylkill with that part of his Army which came over & has by this time his main Body at Darbey about 8 miles from hence & believe designs soon to take his turn & attack How. The Event must leave to That Being who Governs All. Congress tho much Alarmd yet determined not to move till the last Extremity tho they had began to be in earnest about moving from this City before Genll Hows approch. We are Still in great hopes How will never be able to get to his Shipping again. My sincere affection to family & am Your, Elipht Dyer  ""

I every time Inclosed you the Last papers. You have them again now, by which you will find we have had a Battle at Shad's ford upon the Brandywine, and Our brave troops Obliged to leave the field entirely owing to a mistake in the intelligence received. Our Army however are in high Spirits & very desirous of having another Brush with the Enemy who by the last Accounts still remain on the field. By the best Accounts as yet received of the Loss sustained by us is about 400 killed & wounded, and a gentleman who was lately near the field of Battle was informed by the inhabitants of that part of the Country who had viewed the Dead that there were at least three to one killd of the Enemy. It is supposed Genl.

Howes whole Army which ended after 4 hours engagement in the enemies keeping the field and our Army retiring. But Gen. Howe may say with Pyrrhus, such another victory will ruin me. Every account of Officers and Country people who have been in the field since the Action say the enemies loss in killed & wounded must be between 2 & 3000. Nothing proves this more strongly than their remaining yet upon the field of battle, when every interest called upon them to push. Our loss in killed & wounded scarcely comes up to 500. The Militia were never engaged, nor was a strong division of our Army much in battle. The Virginia Troops have gained immortal honor. No capital Officers are lost and none wounded except the Marquis Fayette in the Leg & Gen. Woodford in the hand, but neither badly. Our Army is now the greatest part between Darby & Schuilkill-Two Brigades on this side-All in high spirits and wishing for another trial with the enemy.

  Hond Sir Philadela. Sepr. 13th. 1777, Saturd. Eveng. In my last I hinted my & the common apprehention that Howe did not intend to fight till his Ships had got into the Delawar, but the Event has shewd it otherwise. Thursday last was a day of most severe Conflict, & it has pleased the holy God to suffer it end for that Time to our great disadvantage. Between 8 & 9 oClock in the morning the Enemy attempted to force a passage over the Brandywine river at Chads Ford near which our main Body was placed, they began a heavy Canonade which was returnd & brot on a prodigious Fire, wherein we had great advantage &ca in an Engagemt which lasted till about 11. The Gen. had advice They were moving their main body about 6 or 8 miles higher up to another Ford near to which was Gen Sullivan &c., who had sent the Genl. that advice, on which Gen Stephens, Green, & one more division were ordered to the assistance of Sullivan, but the Genl received again Intelligence from him that the first advice was a mistake, (1) on which their march was countermanded, but unhappily, as the first advice was true, & about 5 oClo. they forced the Passage before Sullivan was able to form, tho he attacked them with great Bravery as did many others posted there about. A very heavy & tremendous Fire took place for considerable time; old officers & all I have seen say beyond what they conceived possible from Musquetry. Our men fought with great Bravery, but were obliged to yield to superior numbers, & broke & fled, about 15 min. before Green's Division came up, who was however of great advantage in covering the Retreat & in the defence of so many, sent to the upper Ford. The Enemy also forced a passage at Chads & our Army retreated as fast as cod well be & brot off all the amunition & Baggage Waggons &c &c which were very numerous, but lost 9 pieces of Cannon (they are replaced from the City tis said). The Enemy were left masters of the Field, the Con- SEPTEMBER 13, 1777  Portrait of William Williams  fusion of the Day was great. Genl Washington retreated to Chester, abt 12 Miles below us, & endeavord to collect his Army there, as they went & scatterd in such Confusion, I trust he will never find them all again by many, who are alive. The Genl is now got to German Town, 6 mi. from this northward, where his headquarters are, & I take it the main of his army. The Loss on our side is very much unknown even to the Genl, some are confident not more than 400 of killd, wounded & missing, & others are Confident it is at least 1000, & every one inclines to think the Enemys is much larger, some say at least 3 to one, but doubtful to me. We always think in this way. As our Army was much dispersed having many Posts & Passes to defend, not near all were ever engaged & few or none of the militia. Tis said by every one that they behaved with great bravery, but were under many disadvantages of ground &c, & also that They are yet in good Spirits & not dismayed. The Genl also has strong Faith, yet effectually to resist them, both which I believe are true.  The Storys are very many & various & volumes wod not contain them.  It is said & believed the Enemy have not moved from the field, but reports have been that they are moved up to the Sweeds Ford over the Schuykill about 15 miles & will come by the way of Germ Town & also that part are gone to Wilmington &c. I rather think the first is true, & that They are much galled, & wait for 4000 Recruits from Rhode Island, N York, & parts adjacent, which we learn from Peekskill They had sent for before the Battle, & are probably hard bye. Congress had also sent for 1500 from that place before the Action. 4000 Jersey Militia are on the move & expect them in 2 or 3 days. The whole Militia of this State are called upon & 5000, to march, but I cant say they turn out with Spirit, tho some worthy men of the City affirm They Do. Tis said 1500 Maryland Militia are in their rear coming on, have heard nothing from Virgin. but hope They are moved. The People of the City seem to be a little stirred & but very little. They are amazingly stupid & seem to think no harm will come to them, tho there is little doubt but the murderers are promised the plunder of the Town. Indeed tis hard for me to say whether the greater part will be well pleased with Howe's success. A flag is come to the Genl this day, it is said, with proposals to succur our wounded prisoners in their hands & with promise that the rest shall be treated as those of War &c. Some are disposed to make light of what has happened, & others to aggravate it to the highest degree. Most certainly it is a serious & important affair, to have such an Army so full of confidence & Spirit, so worsted, as to find it proper to retreat above 30 miles, & make their last stand, where such another Encounter will certainly be fatal as to this City.  It is an awful Frown of divine Providence, but we are not at all  humbled under it, a sad sign that more dreadful Evils await Us. We are indeed at a most critical & tremendous Crisis, a powerful Army, flushed with victory & animated by the strongest motives, Riches & Glory before them, no hope of Escape from Shame & Death but by Conquest, pursuing & at the Gates of this great City. Yet if we have a few Days & the People turn out & behave as They ought on such an Occasion, we might have yet great hope & to be sure, I am far from Despairing, that God will yet save Us. Yet We have reason to tremble. Our amazing Sins totally unrepented of to all appearance, is the burden of my perpetual Fear, & apprehentions, but such Language is most exceedingly ungrateful & unattended to here. What can we then expect but God's Mercy is infinite & greater than our Sins. Yet does he usually save a People that wont be saved & fight against him Yet I must & cant but hope, but perhaps it is a false & illgrounded Hope. I must however entertain, till I know it is so.  The next News you receive from hence will be of vast importance, God grant in his infinite mercy, it may be happy. Shod They succeed, tho the blow must be terrible & the Wound deep, but I hope not incurable, the Effect it may have on our Credit & currency will not be the least dangerous. What will become of us in such a Case, God only knows. Congress are not disposed even to consider where we shod remove to, if we are not able to stay here, & I dont expect They will till the last minute. We are in the hands of an infinitely wise & great Being, who orders all Things well. O that every Soul was joining with you in ardent Supplications for the Reformation of this People & for the deliverance & Salvation of this Land.

  Sir Philad. 15th Septr. 1777 You have undoubtedly before this heard of the late Battle between the grand armies under General Washington & General Howe. General Washington's Account is enclosd.(1) I was in hopes to have had it in my power to collect a more particular Account of this sharp & bloody conflict founded upon satisfactory Evidence. But as the Enemy were last masters of the field of Battle my Expectations have hitherto been disappointed.  Several Countrymen have viewd the Field, before the dead were buried, who, according to their Report, amounted to 1500 at least, more than two thirds of them British & Hessian. There can be no doubt but the Loss was very great as the Enemy have not Attempted to improve their Advantage. Their main Army now lies between Namun's Creek and Wilmington about 24 miles from this City. General Washington has repassed the Schuylkil & gone towards them. A large Body of Militia, the Light Infantry Corps, & Light Horse are hanging about them. If I may be indulged a conjecture I presume that General Howe will strongly fortify the Camp he now occupies & wait the arrival of the Fleet which is expected up the Delaware: if not of the Reinforcement which it is said he has orderd from New York and Rhode Island.  I am sorry to inform your Excellency that my only Colleague here, Mr. Duer, is sick & has been incapable of attending Congress for about 10 days during which time the state has had no Vote.

How is about 15 miles from Us, the other Way. The City seems to be asleep, or dead, and the whole State scarce alive. Maryland and Delaware the same.  The Prospect is chilling, on every Side. Gloomy, dark, melancholly, and dispiriting. When and where will the light spring up ?  Shall We have good News from Europe? Shall We hear of a Blow struck by Gates? Is there a Possibility that Washington should beat How? Is there a Prospect that McDougal and Dickinson should destroy the Detachment in the Jersies ?  From whence is our Deliverance to come? Or is it not to come? Is Philadelphia to be lost? If lost, is the Cause lost? No-the Cause is not lost-but it may be hurt.  I seldom regard Reports, but it is said that How has marked his Course, from Elke, with Depredation. His Troops have plunderd Henroosts, dairy Rooms, the furniture of Houses and all the Cattle of the Country.

  Dear Sir, Philada. Septr. 16. 1777. Tuesday Morning. By the Post which left this City on Saturday I acknowledged the Receipt of your Letter of the 6th, & I am now to thank you for your favor of the 11th. I sent you by Mr. Wm. Hammand 20,000 Dollars. I hope he got safe to you. We hear Colo. Gist was at Christeen Bridge on Saturday with 400 of our Eastern Shore Militia, & that Genl. Smallwood was the same Day at Nottingham with 1000 of the western Shore Militia. I wish You had or could inform Me of the Number of our Militia under each of these Gentlemen.  It will be impossible to obtain a Declaration from Congress that our Militia should be subject to their own Articles of War. I pressed it with every Argument in my Power when the Requisition was made for our Militia. I before mentioned to you that our Militia will not be joined to the Regular Troops. Mr. John Adams, Chairman of the Board of War & who constantly attends, knows of no such Letter to Mr Peale, & is inclined to think no such order ever issued.  On Fryday Night the Enemy, to the Amount of 1000 or 1500, entered into Wilmington, without the least Discovery by the Town or Governor McKinlay who they made Prisoner.  On Sunday Morning Genl. Washington marched with his army from the Heights of Schuykill, near German Town, and on yesterday at 3 o'Clock A.M. he was at Bucks Tavern (near Radnor Meeting) on the Lancaster Road, about 16 Miles from this City, & was moving up that Road to get in between the Enemy & the Swedes ford. The main Body of the Enemy, from the best Intelligence G.W. has been able to get, lies near Dilworth Town near Birmingham, not far from the field of action, where they have been busily employed in burying their Dead, which from accounts amounted to a considerable Number.  We are informed the Enemy from Staten Island have made an Excursion into the Jersies & landed 1000 at Elizabeth Town point, & 1000 more at Second River. They have possessed themselves Elizabeth Town & Newark; this Movement is designed to keep their Militia at Home.  By Letters from Genl Gates of the 10th ulto. from Still Water he is moving towards the Enemy. I before mentioned that Burgoyne was at fort Edward. Baton Kiln is in his front & Hudsons River on his left. I SEPTEMBER 16, 1777  am informed by a Letter from Mr. Wells from Albany, that Gates has above 7000, and Lincoln 5,000.  Mr Smith sends to Dr Boyd an [account ?] received from Gen. Dickenson of Howe's force which he got from N York.  Mr. McHenry waits. Adieu.  Your Friend, S Chase  P.S. Would it not be proper to publish the Substance of what Intelligence I send you? Send to Paca-no Conveyance to him from thence- his Son is well, & all his Relatives here.  Genl.

  Sir Philad. 16th Septr. 1777 I had the Honour to write to your Excellency Yesterday. Every moment is now become interesting and the Prospect of a general Engagement on which much depends cannot be contemplated without the utmost Anxiety. The British Army since the late bloody Engagement moves with the utmost Caution. They are now at Dilworth Town not far from the late field of Battle. Our main army about 12 miles distant from them stretches between the Enemy and the Sweeds ford on the Schuyl-kill. The Light Infantry under General Maxwell & 2000 Pensylvania militia are gone on some Enterprize I imagine in the rear of the Enemy. Col. Gest with about 700 Maryland militia lies at Christiana about Twelve miles above the Town of Wilmington, Genl Smallwood with about 1100 at Oxford 9 miles South of the field of Battle. There are other parties at different places. I suppose General Washington will soon bring on an Action to deprive General Howe of the Advantage of cooperating with his shipping for which he is very probably waiting; tho' the bloody battle of the Brandywine undoubtedly demanded for the Survivors some Repose. A few days will decide the Fortune of the two Generals, & probably the Fate of this City; so far as respects its being either consigned to Plunder, or delivered from that dreadfull Calamity: for that General Howe shoud be able to hold it with an Army of not 10,000 men when they left New York woud be too extraordinary to admit of serious Apprehension unless we can first be perswaded that the Patriotism and the promises of the Southern states were meer Puffs and Delusions. I look, Sir, to the North with the utmost solicitude. Pleasing as are the Prospects I await the important Event with the utmost Impatience. Good news from thence woud  SEPTEMBER 16, 1777  animate every Breast.

  Dear Sir 16th September [1777] Since my arrival at this place I have had the honour of twice addressing Your Excellency, the 12th Ulto. by Capt. Hornback & the 10th Inst. by Doctor Houston.(1)  The present is intended by the Revd. Mr. Holmes who calls late in the evening to acquaint me of his intention to begin his journey to Carolina early to Morrow Morning, tis probably the last trouble I shall give your Excellency from this Station, it may be the last I shall ever give.  As my Colleagues have been Some days absent, gone with their families to a place of Supposed Safety & as I may find it necessary to leave Town this very night I think it my duty to devote a few minutes to transmit a brief State of our affairs at the present Instant.  Colonel Horry who went away yesterday & who will probably be with you before this, will inform Your Excellency in general & in many particulars the rise & progress of last Thursday's battle I will therefore only add on that head, that by accounts which Congress has received this day we are confirmed in beleif that the loss of the Enemy was very great, not less than one Thousand killed & probably as many or more wounded, had it been otherwise tis not to be doubted that  SEPTEMBER 16, 1777  General Howe wouId have improved the advantage which one unlucky mistake on our Side had afforded him & have been in possession of Philadelphia upon Friday. I Speak from appearances & accounts which deserve Credit.  General Washington as Speedily as circumstances would admit of recollected his forces, recrossed the Schuylkil Sunday the 14th. This morning he informed Congress of his being within a few Miles of the Enemy, that as his Troops had been hard Marched he had halted & given them an opportunity of refreshing themselves, that the British Commander had discovered a \""violent inclination\"" to get again on his right & intimated the Signs of an approaching Second battle. He strongly recommends the immediate removal of all public Stores from hence & the most Speedy efforts to Supply his Troops with Blankets & Clothing.  The recommendation to remove Stores is construed by many Members of Congress to imply their own removal, which they Suppose & Some have Said he wishes for, although he may not think plainer terms becoming from this circumstances. If we do not learn Some event very favourable to us, the Representatives of the 13 United States will be Scattered to morrow & proceed in hopes of reuniting at Lancaster or York Town.  General Washington commenced his last March determined against waiting to be attacked. The nearness of the two Armies therefore puts it beyond a doubt that a Second general battle, provided the Enemy is not averse, will happen to morrow if the Weather Shall not forbid. At this moment it rains tremendously & the air does not promise to favour Gunpowder in a few hours. For my own part I feel under all discouraging appearances confident of Success. I have learned from Officers who were in the heat & the hottest of that heat of the 11th Inst. that our Men are firm, that they showed no fear of Superior power of Cannon nor of fixed Bayonets. They are gone out now determined to recover the honour lost on that day by the Shameful misconduct of Some of the Officers. These I flatter my Self will behave better & be doubly anxious to bury in oblivion the remembrance of their Crimes. 'Tis much to be lamented as a part of those Crimes we cannot obtain returns of our late loss nor of the present State of the Army. The latter from the best guess accounts I compute to be nine to ten Thousand Continental & five to Six Thousand good Militia if any Militia besides those under General Starks can be called good. From an orderly Book found in the pocket of a Slain Captain of the 49th British, General Washington had computed General Howe's whole force embarked at New York to have been under 9000, & from an authentic Account which we have obtained from New York of the whole forces under his Command, a Copy of which I shall here inclose, Your Excellency will beleive it could not have been greater.   Yesterday Congress was informed of the landing of 2000 Troops from Staten Island & New York at Elizabeth Town & this day General Dickinson has advised that the number landed there was 4000, in consequence of which he was that minute going to Assemble all the Militia who had been otherwise intended as auxiliaries to General Washington. We have also advise of nine Ships of War being as high up the River as Reedy Island, of a very dangerous plot concerted in this State & part a Neighbouring Colony extending from Fort Pitt to the Enemy's Army & that some of the chief conspirators were apprehended & Committed to Gaol.(2)  If Townes Evening post comes abroad this Evening Your Excellency will find also inclosed an extraordinary history of Correspondence between the invincible Burgoyne & General Gates from whence it appears that our affairs are in a pleasing State in the Northern department.(3)  All the Stores, Sick & wounded which had been removed hence to Trenton are now ordered to be carried to Bethlehem. The New Frigates & some other Navigation are as high at Burlington if the Enemy should penetrate so high these will form funeral pyres.  Other Frigates, Fire Ships & Wrafts, Gallies, Gondolois & Gun Boats are below. What defence or destruction these will make is very uncertain but as Billings port is abandoned & Fort Island not in a full posture of defence, I am apprehensive the Enemy's fleet will meet with no great resistance from them. The land battle will decide their fate.  General Caudre unfortunately drowned this morning in Schuylkill. Baron duKalb yesterday appointed a Major General his Commission if he accepts to be dated one day anterior to that of Marquis delafayette who lies wounded in his Leg at Bristol where If I am obliged to run I mean to call for him.(4)  We are drawn to an important Crisis. If we are blessed with Success, my native Country will probably enjoy another Winter unmolested; on the contrary, she must expect a Severe attack before Christmas. It will be her wisdom to prepare immediately without hesitation or waiting for events to increase her honour & military fame.  I must now go through the weather to learn if any thing momentous has happened Since I came home & if necessary at my return a postscript shall be added, mean time I beg leave to Salute your Excellency with repeated assurances of being with respect Esteem &c.

  My dear Betsy Philada. Sept 17. 1777  Your kind Letter of the 29th of August is now before me. You therein take a very proper Notice of the signal Success of our Affairs at the Northward. I hope my Countrymen are duly sensible of the obligation they are under to Him from whose Hand, as you justly observe, our Victory came. We had a Letter from General Gates yesterday, from which we every hour expect another great Event from that Quarter. The two Armies this Way had an obstinate Engagement last Thursday. The Enemy have gaind a Patch of Ground but from all Accounts they have purchasd it as dearly as Bunkers Hill. Two or three more such Victories would totally ruin their Army. Matters seem to be drawing to a Crisis. The Enemy have had enough to do to dress their wounded and bury their dead. Howe still remains near the Field of Battle. Genl. Washington retreated with his Army over the River Schuylkill through this City as far as (1) [Germantown]. There he recollected his Forces and [recrossed] the River again & posted himself [. . .] the Enemy. Our Soldiers [. . .] eager for Action and we are every day expecting another Battle. May Heaven favor our righteous Cause and grant us compleat Victory. Both the Armies are about 26 Miles from this City.  I am pleasd to hear that Col Crafts invited Mr Thacher to preach a Sermon to his Regiment. He discovered the true Spirit of a New England Officer. I dare say it was an animating Discourse. Religion has been & I hope will continue to be the ornament of N England. While they place their Confidence in God they will not fail to be an happy People.

  My dear Sir Philade Sept. 17 1777  I receivd your favor of the 1st Instant. I have not Time at present SEPTEMBER 17, 1777  to give you a particular Account of our Military Movements in this Quarter. I suppose you will have it from our Friend Mr J A. There was an obstinate Engagement last Thursday. The Enemy were left Masters of the Field, but by all Accounts the Advantage was on our side. Howe & his Army remain near the Field of Battle. They have had much to do in dressing their wounded & burying their dead. General Washington retreated over the Schuilkil to Germantown a few Miles above this City, where he recruited his Soldiers. He has since recrossed the River and is posted on the Lancaster Road about 12 Miles distant from the Enemy. His Troops are in high Spirits & eager for Action. We soon expect another Battle. May Heaven favor our righteous Cause & grant us compleat Victory ! Both the Armies are about 26 Miles from this Place. A Wish for the New England Militia would be fruitless. I hope we shall do the Business without them.  I have a favor to ask of you in behalf of my very worthy Friend R. H. Lee. He supposes that Mr Gardoque of Bilboa has sent him some Jesuits Bark. I wish you would inquire of the Captains from Bilboa & forward it to him, if any is arrivd, by the first safe opportunity. I have requested the same thing of Capt John Bradford, not knowing but the Multiplicity of publick Affairs might render it impossible for you to attend to it, although I am sure you will oblige so good a Patriot as Mr Lee if it may be in your Power.  We are told that the Enemy have landed in the Jerseys, 4000 strong. You can tell whether they have left Rhode Island. I have Reason to hope that an equal Number of spirited Jersey Militia are musterd under the Command of General Dickinson, Brother of the late Patriot. These were designd for a Reinforcement to the Army here. If the Report be true, these Militia joynd with 1500 Troops from Peeks Kill (undoubtedly now in Jersey) under the Command of Brigd General McDougal, will be sufficient to give a good Account of them.  I think our Affairs were never in a better Scituation. Our troops are victorious in the North. The Enemies Troops are divided & scatterd over a Country several Hundred Miles. Our Country is populous & fertile. If we do not beat them this Fall will not the faithful Historian record it as our own Fault. But let us depend, not upon the Arm of Flesh, but on the God of Armies. We shall be free if we deserve it. We must succeed in a Cause so manifestly just, if we are virtuous. Adieu my Friend. S A  ""

  Dr Sir Philadelphia Sept 17th 1777 I wrote you a few Lines from Head Quarters on Brandywine near  SEPTEMBER 17, 1777  Chads Ford on the Tenth Instant, and in them gave you the hopes I then Entertained of seeing in a few hours our Arms triumphant over our Enemies. I am sorry I can not now tell you those hopes were realised. I am constrained to give you a detail of Circumstances which have grieved me to the Soul, and I know will give you and my Country great concern.  On the morning of the eleventh about Eight oclock the Enemy appeared on hights to the southward of the Creek and a little to the westward of Chads ford. They drew up in order, and erected Barbet Batteries from whence they kept up a Cannonade on our Lines which were formed on the North side of the Creek in a Meadow flanked by Hills to the right and left, on which we had several pieces of Artillary posted to advantage and from whence a well directed fire was kept up very hot until eleven, by which time the Enemy's Batteries were Silenced and their Troops driven from the Grounds on which they had first formed in the morning. During the Cannonade the Light Troops on both sides skirmished very warmly and always with advantage to us. Lower down the Creek Extended General Washington's left Wing composed of four thousand Pennsylvania Militia who had no Opportunity of engaging. Up the Creek extended the right commanded by Major General Sullivan. About two oClock the General received advice that a Body of the Enemy amounting to five thousand had moved up the Creek in order to pass at a ford about four or five miles distance. He immediately made the necessary dispositions for encountering them so as to prevent their getting on his right Flank. Soon after this General Sullivan was Informed by a Country man, a Major of Militia, that he had come along the road which immediately led from that Ford and had seen no Enemy, whereupon he dispatched Information to General Washington that he was Convinced from the Countryman's Intelligence that no Enemy was upon that rout, and the General in Consequence thereof halted the Troops destined to resist them. The Error was not discovered until it was to late to bring the Troops up in good order. The Consequence was that the Brigades which first formed were attacked before they Expected it, and those who were forming were thrown into disorder, and soon routed. The right and left Flanks of those who were first formed were then exposed, and the Enemy gained such advantage thereby that they overpowered our Troops and defeated them with the loss of their Field pieces, five in Number. The Evil did not end here. Green's division and Nash's Brigade which formed the chief strength of the centre were ordered to the right to reinforce the Troops on that Wing. By this General Wayne was left to sustain an fierce engagement for an hour and an half against Numbers greatly superior, and under a heavy Cannonade which the Enemy now renewed from Batteries lower down. He and his Troops behaved with exemplary Gallantry and after destroying great Numbers of the Enemy retreated without losing their  Artillary or leaving their wounded behind them. Coll. Proctor with some Artilary was posted on the right of Wayne and was attacked by a strong Column of the Enemy who forced their way within Pistol shot before our men gave way and at length they brought off their Guns except two whose Horses a Waggoner had run away with.  None of the reinforcement had time to get up so as to engage except Weedons Brigade who checked the Enemy and very Gallantly covered the retreat of the whole Army. The Enemy did not dare to pursue but retired from the field of Battle that night.  During this action I had an Opportunity of observing that our Troops and Inferior Officers are exceedingly good, but that our Major Generals (one only excepted) are totally inadequate. They were so disconcerted by the unexpected attack of the Enemy that they knew not what to do but to permit, (some say to order) a precipitate retreat. Sullivan to compleat his Blunder made a circuit of two Miles when one quarter in the direct road would have brought him to his Ground, and he arrived so late that it was preoccupied, but as he was Commander in that Wing he insisted on Changing the disposition, and while he was attempting it, his Troops which were brought up in great confusion, were pressed by the Enemy, and not being able to form into any order fled without resistance. These Miscarriages snatched from my Hopes the Glory of a Compleat Victory which was certainly in our Power if Sullivan had not by his Folly and misconduct ruined the Fortune of the Day.  Judge Sir how disagreeable must be my reflections on this Occasion, when my Sanguin and well founded hopes were at once cut off not by the Superiority of the Enemy but by so glaring an Insufficiency in our Officers. Could the Commander in Chief's Ideas be executed I should deem our Success certain. But I have the Melancholy Conviction that his principle Officers are Incompetent, and I fear it is an Evil that cannot be remedied.  Sullivan was for three days posted on the right Wing, and furnished with Horse and light Troops for reconnoitring. Yet so uninformed was he of the Ground that he knew not even the roads by which the Enemy might march to attack his flank, and altho he was warned by the General that the Enemy would in all likelihood make that movement, and was ordered to keep out reconnoitring parties in order to know certainly their force and motions, yet he relied on the Information of a Country man who passed along One road while the Enemy were marching on the other. This unfortunate General has ever been the Marplot of our army, and his Miscarriages are I am persuaded owing to a total want of Military Genius, and to One of that sort of understandings which is unable to take a full comprehensive view of an object, but employs it's Activity in Subtle Senseless refinement. Thus persuaded, I thought it my Duty to Endeavour to have him removed   from his Command, and I succeeded so far as to have a resolution passed for recalling him. But General Washington remonstrated against it at so critical a time and the Execution is now left to his discretion. (1)  In a word Sir, so long as our army is Conducted by such Officers I shall not be very Sanguin in my Expectations of Success. However I shall hope for the best, and as our army is composed of good Troops, and in general of good Officers from the Major Generals downwards, and under the auspicious Command of General Washington, I shall keep up my expectations until I know the Issue of our other Battle. Our loss was not very considerable tho I know not the particulars. The Enemy have suffered so much that ever Since they have not attempted to advance. General Washington has put his Troops again in order, and has disposed his army so as to hang on their flank if they attempt to cross the Scuylkill. I wish we could Once bring ourselves to attack them instead of waiting for them to attack us. We should certainly have the advantages which they now have over us.  Our affairs in the northern department bear a very promising aspect. General Gates has a formidable army under his Command, and was by the last Accounts on the point of attacking General Burgoin.  There are certain accounts of a plot of a very Extensive Nature formed in this State for blowing up Our Magazines and destroying our Stores. The particulars are not yet come to light but the Execution is prevented. (2)  Captain Caswell is well. I shook hands with him on the Field of Battle.  I have the honor to be, with the greatest respect and Esteem, Your very obdt hum Set. Tho Burke  ""

  Dear General Philad. 17t Sept. 1777 I have the Honour of your favour of the 3d Instant: on the various subjects of which I have no Time to comment; nor is it necessary, since you may be assurd that I return every Sentiment with regard to you which I was impressed with when we separated. Accounts daily come in of the severe Losses of the Enemy in the late bloody Battle of the Brandywine. Their Killed and wounded are estimated between 2 & 3000, a large proportion of Officers and one General being of the number. You see from this Account that there is no certainty, all depending on the Conjectures of the Country people. To keep up the SEPTEMBER 17, 1777  Spirits of the British Troops reports are propogated among them that General Washington was totally defeated, his army dispersed, & that they woud not be able to give the least Opposition to General Howe's designs. However they doubtless changd their opinion yesterday: for at 1/2 past 2 oClock P.M. they met General Washington at the Head of his army about 24 miles up the Lancaster Road prepard to give them another battle-which was only prevented by a violent Shower of Rain. General Washington's Army is in good order and Superior to General Howe's exclusive of the Militia-which last is not inconsiderable. Every moment we expect an Express from the Army with the important Issue of the Battle; If this Express does not set off before we receive further Intelligence I will furnish you with the News.  The Troops from Staten Island & the City of New York to the amount it is said of 4000 have enterd East Jersey & will probably gain Morris Town before a competent Force can be collected to oppose them, tho' it is not doubted they will be driven back when the Country can be raised.  I long most ardently to hear of the Issue of the Campaign to the Northward where Genl Burgoin seems to be much inferior to the American Army. Adieu. I present my Complt. to Mrs. Schuyler, the young Ladies & all our other Friend & believe me to be, with the greatest Respect, Dear Sir, your most Obedt. & very hume servt,  Jas. Duane ""

  My dear Sir Philadelphia Sepr 17. 1777  Since my last I am favoured with yours of August 31st with the Agreable Intelligence of Capts. Lee's & Harris's Arrivals.(1) The Contents of your Letter & of the Invoices inclosed by Messrs. Gardoqui's were communicated to Congress, in Consequence of which You will receive Orders by this Conveyance from the Committee of Commerce, for the Delivery of the Goods; unless the general Hurry, which the Approach of the Enemy to this City occasions, should prevent it; in which Case You'll please to deliver the Duck & Tent Cloth to the D Q M General, the Cloathing to the Agent of the Cloathier General, the Salt to the order of the Commissary or D Commissary General of Issues for the eastern District, the naval Stores to the navy Board of the District, & the Medicines to the Dep. Director General or his order. An Order passed Congress on the Loan office of your State, in Favour of the Commte. mentioned, for 5000 Dollars, wch is to be sent to You by this Conveyance for the purpose of defraying the Expences  SEPTEMBER 17, 1777  mentioned in your Letter.(2) The Circumstances of Capt Harris's Conduct have also been mentioned to Congress, & no objection was made to the proposal of his continuing in the Command of his Vessel, which will probably be ordered to Carolina for a Load of rice. Duplicate Receipts being taken for all the Articles delivered, one of each may be forwarded to the Committee.  Inclosed are printed Copies of two Letters from General Washington & his Secretary of the 11th Instant wch. may serve to give You some Idea of the Battle of the Brandywine, wch happened on that Day(3) This Creek empties into the Delaware about 26 Miles below the City, & runs a considerable Way into the Country. At the Mouth on the other Side is Wilmington, & it is there crossed by a fine Bridge. About twelve Miles from the Bridge into the Country is Chads Ford, & 5 or 6 Miles from thence higher up is Jones's Ford, at & near which was fought the Battle. General Washington was a few Days before posted on the Heights of Chrystine Creek, about 8 or 10 Miles on the other Side the Brandywine, but General Howe declined giving him Battle on that Ground & passed him on the Right, which left the Delaware in his Rear, the Brandywine on his Right Wing & White Clay creek on his left, with the Enemy to the Westward & in Front. This occasioned the Removal of our Army to the N E Side of the Brandywine, on the Banks of which opposite Chads Ford they posted themselves. The Enemy approached this Ford on the Morning of the 11th, abt 3/4 after 8, & began a Cannonade, which We distinctly heard at this place & wch was returned by our Army untill 11, when it ceased for the most part. Here General Maxwell twice crossed with about 1000 of the continental Troops, which were picked from the several Brigades & formed into a Corps of light Infantry. The first Time he advanced about a Mile or two, & as the Enemy came on retreated to a pass or Defile, where he formed a Kind of an Ambuscade & poured on them a very heavy Fire. This did considerable Execution, as is agreed on all Sides, & their Loss is by the General's Computation which by far is the most modest, above three hundred killed & wounded. The second attack of Maxwells, by the Secretary's Letter left 30 of the Enemy dead on the Spot, & of Course the wounded were double the Number. Mean while General Sullivan, who was posted on the Right to guard Jones Ford, was inforrned by some Scouts that the Enemy were marching up the Country, but discredited it from the Information of a Farmer not having seen them, could not confirm the first Account. Lord Stirling & Stevens with their Divisions, who in the Afternoon were posted near to Sullivan, on hearing the Account that the Enemy had crossed the Creek marched towards them, & soon meeting them formed for Battle. Sullivan also marched, but by the best Information to be had, was attacked before he could form. Whether it was owing to Chance or Misconduct, I must leave You to judge. A very warm engagement  ensued, in which was as heavy a Fire from the Musketry as perhaps has been known this War in America, but the Disorder into which Sullivan's Division was soon thrown, was communicated to the others, & obliged the three Divisions after a severe Conflict of between one & two Hours to retire in Haste. General Washington however arrived in Time to cover the Retreat with Green's Division, which with General Conway's Brigade in Sterlings Division behaved incomparably well. The Enemy at Chads Ford at this Time pressed on, & obliged Maxwell & Wayne, who were unsupported by the Militia wch were posted three Miles below them towards the Bridge, to give up the Ground. What the Loss on either Side is, I cannot ascertain, but that the Enemy have received a severe Check is evident from their Silence since the Battle. I have not any Doubt that they are at least 1500 weaker (killed & wounded) by this Action, which We have Reason to think much exceeded our Loss. Indeed the people from the Country make their Loss much greater, but to avoid Disapointments, it becomes necessary to form moderate Expectations. General Washington two Days after the Battle, marched his Army to Philadelphia, from whence he went to German Town about five Miles from hence up the Schulkyll River, there he crossed & is now about fifteen Miles from this City on the Northwest, & the Enemy about the same Distance on the Southwest. 1500 of the Maryland Militia are to joyn him in a Day or two, & 2500 of the Continental Troops are ordered from Peeks Kill, also 3 or 4000 of the Jersey Militia are ordered to be embodied, which must soon make him powerfull. The Enemy have lately landed two Divisions of 1000 Men each, in New Jersey, & will probably find Employment for most of the Jersey Militia. The Governor & Council of that State do not however appear to have much Apprehension of their Power to penetrate the Country, having ordered their western Militia to reinforce General Washington. A Reinforcement of two thousand Men is also expected from Virginia, but these I presume will not be in Time for an Engagement wch is daily Expected & in our present Situation will put General Howe between G Washington & this City. The Enemy's Ships of War are as high up as Wilmington, & probably mean to co'opperate with their General. Thus You will see, that the Campaign opens briskly, altho late, in this quarter. The publick stores & papers are removed to places of Safety, it being tho't improper to keep them in a place for wch the Armies are at present contending; & our Troops are in high Spirits.  9 oClock in the Morning. I am just now informed that last Evening the Armies were so near to each other as to have a warrn Skirmish, which would have ended in a General Engagement had not the Rain wch fell very plentifully prevented it. If General Howe should be tripped, he will find it difficult to recover, whilst our situation may admit of Recovery under repeated Misfortunes.   Our Affairs at the Northward, by late Advices looked very favourable, & e'er this reaches You I think something important may happen in that Quarter.  With respect to foreign News, We have none, save a Continuance of the friendly Disposition of the Courts of France & Spain, so far as it respects their assisting us by Supplies; I think their Conduct in not immediately recognizing our Independence, to wch the former early professed to be a Friend, shews that they so far regard their own Interest as to run as little Risque as possible. Indeed if the Credit of our Currency is established, wth We are in a fairer Way of accomplishing than We have yet been in, I think We can oppose Great Britain without their declaring War; but this will not justify their Conduct in the Matter, when they well know that the power of G Britain was sufficient to overcome their united Exertions during the last War. We have however the strongest assurances from some of our Commissioners that War will be declared before the next Campaign, if the present is attended with tolerable Success.  The Confederation will I hope be finished before the Winter comes on, but this also depends in some Measure on the Success of our Arms. I can only add that with much Esteem I remain sir yours sincerely,  E Gerry P.S. As I have not Time to write to my Freinds at M[arble]head, I shall be much obliged to You if a Copy of the Letter relative to the Action of the 11th can be taken by your Clerk & sent to Mr Gerry.  ""

  My Dear Sir, Philadelphia Sept 17. 1777. Your favor of double date the 25th and 30th is before me. That same \""military check\"" will justly rank for its consequences with the most capital blows given to the enemy this war, while in circumstances of bravery it not only exceeds them but the actions of any modern campaign. It has been proposed as a stimulus in General Orders to the Continental Army in this quarter.  As to the affair at Brandywine last Thursday I doubt whether you will even accurately know whether fortune alone is to be blamed, or whether Sullivan and the Chief should not share with her in the slanderous murmurs. Knowledge of the enemy's intentions on the right wing of our army was certainly wanting. General Washington and some good military men especially the highest officers do not charge the want to Sullivan. But as he was under the order of Congress for a Court of Enquiry as to Staten Island the Maryland officers in his division, the delegates of that State, the great Burck, the friend of St Clair and the connexions of Schuyler accomplished to cast such reflections upon his want of capacity to direct a wing of our army in this critical day, that a majority, after first demolishing old De Borre affected the Resolve to recall Sullivan till his conduct should be enquired into as per former order. You are to take with you that an attempt to send St Clair to join the Army had been baffled. Agreeable to the prophecy of the Minority the Commander in Chief has written in the most pressing manner for a suspension of the Order of recall which being carried Ch_____e moved that a direction might go to put the Maryland troops under some other M. G[enera]l which would have been in effect throwing out S_____ n, for the soldiers of other divisions would be unwilling to serve under a man discarded by the Marylanders if the Generals would consent to exchange. R____d joined and had the Delaware inserted with Maryland.(1) But these States were the only yeas which agreeable SEPTEMBER 17, 1777  to modern petty practice were booked with the Nays by the request of M d. The foreign officers showed themselves to great advantage in the battle. Brevets are given to Du Coudray and all his officers; he having modestly, for once, asked a Captain's for himself and Lieutenant's for his attendants. In crossing the Scuylkill his horse leaped out of the boat with him, who was foolishly in the saddle and so was drowned yesterday. Count Pulaski who headed the Polanders, is now Commander of our Cavalry, having first signalized himself greatly in the battle of Brandywine. Baron de Kalb who speaks English well and has been in Pennsylvania formerly and who in manners and looks resembles our Chief is made a Major General, but I am not certain he will return having left this City on Monday for South Carolina though I imagine he is yet at Bristol.  The intention of the enemy is to gain upon our right wing, but I think we are so posted as to render it impossible. The Lancaster road must be so perfect a clay pit, that no cannon can move in it for some days after the present very heavy rain. Phil. Dickinson, General of the Jersey militia writes that 4000 of the enemy have visited them. McDougal must join him very shortly as our Order went last Thursday. I doubt not they two will give Courland Skinner and the Tory levies a full beating; for there cannot be above 1200 British, if there is no mistake as to 4000-we heard of only 2000 at first.  Howe's whole command in America is said to be the 16th and 17th regiment of Light Dragoons, 1 Brigade of Guards, 5 Companies of Artillery, 9 regts of Foot, 2 Battalions of Marines, British-Hessians, (2) Companies of Chasseurs, 18 regts Foot, 1 of Artillery.  Ships 50 to 28 guns 34  20 to 10 \"" 22 Bombs 2 Armed Vessels 10  With this trifling force and some Torries he is plaguing several States. Oh Shame! But he will not long continue to do it. I think our affairs are very favourable, among other things a fine Continental cargo from Bilboa at Boston.  Yours affectionately, J.L.  [P.S.] Esq Frost sets out for home tomorrow.  ""

  Gentlemen, Philadelphia Sepr. 17th. 1777 You have doubtless seen the Resolution of Congress, for paying the Interest of the Money they borrow by Bills of Exchange to be paid in France, or in Contl. Bills, at the Election of the Lender.(1) This must give a Spring to the Loan offices and thereby considerably appretiate the Currency. Let this be followed with large Taxes, which the Country were never so able to bear, And we may fully establish Our Credit. In short rightly considered, every Man must see that how great soever the Tax he pays, if proportioned with others, he does not lessen his Estate, because what he still has left is of more Value, than the whole was before, and this will continue to be the Case, till the Quantity of Money is reduced to so much as may be necessary for a Medium of Trade.  Congress have the utmost Assurance that those Bills of Exchange will be punctually paid.  The 11th of this Month is famous for the Battle of Brandewine-a River leading out of Deleware thro' part of the State of Deleware and into Maryland. The Battle was at Chadsford and Birmingham. It began a little before Nine in the Morning with a heavy Cannonade, which was very distinctly heard in Our State House yard about 30 miles from the Place of Action. It lasted till dusk; and tho' we were obliged to leave the Enemy Masters of the Field, yet we may esteem it a Victory, as our whole Loss did not exceed in killed, wounded and missing more than 700. By the best Information from some steady Countrymen who lived near the Spot and were obligd by the Enemy to help bury their Dead, they had 1200 killed, and at least 1500 Wounded. They had not dressed all their wounded in three Days after the Battle, and have remained near the Spot ever since. Genl. Washington marched in a Day or two after, his whole Army this Side Schuylkill, save some reconoitering Parties, and having well refreshed his Men marched again and was yesterday by his Letter,(2) upon the left Flank of the Enemy, and not more than five or seven miles from them. Our Army are in high Spirits and wish for a second Battle which is hourly expected.  We had Information Yesterday that four Thousand of the Enemy had landed in the Jersey, a large Body of Millitia had collected, and Genl McDougall from Peekskill with 500 men, ordered sometime before to march this way, was in the Jerseys, that we are in good Hopes a proper Account will be given of the Enemy. Our Accounts from the Northward are very favourable. By the Blessing of Heaven (and I most sincerely wish we more deserved it) we have Reason to expect a happy Issue to this Campaign. We had Intelligence that all the British Troops SEPTEMBER 17, 1777  had left Rhode Island, but I doubt it. Congress have requested, if the Fact be true that One of your State Battallions may be forwarded to Peekskill, that we may be able to draw the Continental Force from thence as Circumstances may Require.(3) A Requisition of the like kind is gone to Connecticut,(4) And will I presume to Massts.  I hope some Expedient will be found for getting Our Vessells out of Providence River, And that One or two State owned Vessells will be employed to go to France for Arms, Blankets and other Cloathing ballasted with Salt. They may very probably clear the whole Adventure by Prizes. I have offerd this Hint before; I hope my Zeal for the Good of my Country will plead an Excuse for those or any other Observations I have made and am with great Truth, Your most obedient and humble Servant, Hy. Marchant  ""

  Sir Philada. Septr. 17th. 1777 On the 11th Instant there was a very severe Ingagement between the Armies of General Washington and Howe, on the Brandywine twelve Miles above Wilmington. The enemy made the attack at 8 oclock; it SEPTEMBER 17, 1777  lasted with little intermission untill dark. The officers say the fire from the Cannon and small arms was the hottest they ever heard of, they kept the ground but paid dearly for it having from the best accounts we have had, lost upwards of 2000 men, one General & several Field officers killed & wounded supposed to be their best men. Our loss is said to be 700 killed & wounded tho' the greatest part of the latter were brought off. Only one field officer was killed a Major Bush. The enemy got seven pieces of Cannon from us.  General Washington retreated over the Schuylkill but the next day marched towards the enemy, taking an upper road. He soon got near the place where the late action was, the enemy having been the whole time busily imploded in burying their dead & taking care of their wounded. The armies have been manuvring for two days, we expect there will soon be another action. It is with pleasure we can inform you that our officers & soldiers are in good spirits anxious for an opportunity of obtaining revenge.  You will observe from General Washington's letter to Congress (1) that our loosing the ground was owing to some mistake as to Intelligence relating to the movement of the enemy.  Our affairs to the Northward are in a promising situation. General Burgoyne has met with such a check as will make him more attentive to effect a retreat to Ticonderoga, than any thing else, as Genl. Gates has nearly the double of his force & a large body are getting into his rear.  General Howe is making his last effort. If he meets with a defeat, he is undone, as he is a considerable distance from his ships, his situation is truly critical. We hope soon to be able to give your Excellency the agreeable news of the success of the American arms. The North Carolina Troops were not ingaged in the late action.

  Hond. Sir Philadel the 17 Sepr. 1777 Wed. Morn I have nothing material to add, since my last by Morris, no important movements of the Armys have taken place since the late action of BrandyWine. Genl Washington is encamped, I cant describe where as SEPTEMBER 17, 1777  Places have no names here. I take it about 15 Miles westerly, or southwesterly from this, at the crossing of sundry Roads, & the way is open for Howe to Us. I take Washingn intends to attack them on the rear, on his attempt to get here. Howes main army the last we heard lay near the place of Action, being doubtless much galled & probably to wait reinforcements, which they have sent for before the action, from R Island, N Y &c & their Ships, We have no certainty about any being in the River, tis said they are & that they have per York or S. Island invaded Jersey agn with 4000 men & they destitute of Amunition, & were supplied from hence yesterday. Probably they hope to penetrate thro to Us or however it will effectually answer their great End of stoping their Militia from Washns assistance, otherwise their Genl Dickinson says he shod have brot 4 or 5000. Tis Confidently said, but we have not sufficient Evidence, that the Enemy buried 1070 at the upper ford, beside what were killed at Chads. Report this morning is that a Skirmish happened yesterday between advance or picquet Gards of the two Armies, but that the rain parted them. The last was an exceeding rainy night. Somthing very important will soon take Place. May every Heart & every Soul be lift up to God for Mercy & Deliverance. Tis most ardently to be wished but alass, alass, how little to be expected, by appearances here, I pray God it may be otherwise in Connecticut !  Congress remain here, but begin to talk & have indeed voted to move to Lancaster if They are obliged to remove. It is about 60 miles west of this. Tis sorely against my Will to move that Way, & as the Time is very nearly expired that I intended to Stay I have some thoughts of returning home but less III Nature shod call it Timidity, beleive I shall not.  The two last Posts brot me no Letters, which was very greivous. If my Freinds have all forgot me, I must bear it.  Intended to have wrote largely about Mr Erkelens, with whom I have had much Conversation, I am fully convinced he is a firm, solid, principled friend to America, & his Stay & manufactures in our Colony wod be a most valuable Acquisition. He is determind if he cant go on there to move to this, the Center & cherisher of all Manufactures, to their immense advantage. (the Wethersfd Peace Maker carries on a great stroke here). The Crops are very large here & thro the Country there is no possible Danger of the armys suffering for want of Bread & I shod think the Spirit for them wod be of very great Importance. They want it exceedingly in this Army. I hope we shall be too wise to loose so valuable a Business, but He wishes most heartily & he mut be rid of the Tory Shaler if it shod be discouraged, for a Time, to make Shaler sell out to him, possibly it wod promote it.  But also what is all this, if God is pleased to give us up to Slavery & Destruction, but I hope in his Mercy, let us not faint nor be discouraged,  SEPTEMBER 18, 1777  but wait patiently for the Lord, & he will not fail them that trust in him. They begin to be alarmed here so as to run out with Effects &c but not so much to fight as I cod wish. With tender Rembrance to yr dear Daughter &c &c I am most respectfully yours &c,  W. Williams [P.S.] This minute I hear in Congress that the Enemy certainly carried 100 waggon load of Wounded to Wilmington. One Genl officer killd &c. They say our army is intirely cut to pieces.

  Dear Sir, 18th September 1777. I had the pleasure of writing to you two or three days ago(1) by favor of Colonel Horry. This will inclose a couple of News Papers. If any thing contained in them valuable to Mr. Wells be so good as to communicate & tell him I have never missed one opportunity of Sending News papers to him directly or through you.  I have written fully in general terms to the president who will let you know what I have Said if worth hearing. Perhaps Letters by express ten days hence will make my intelligence Stale.  SEPTEMBER 18, 1777  All our affairs are undoubtedly in a better appearance than they were three days ago, but fright has driven Some great Men to do precipitantly what I Strongly urged as necessary to do early & deliberately as soon as we learned of Mr. Howe's landing at Elk. But I suffer the fate of all wise Men, my counsel is not always attended to. No wise man however can suffer with more patience & indifference. Some who smiled at the proposition are gone in a hurry, embarrassed, others are now on the wing, we keep enough to make a Congress & that's all. I shall remain as long as any. I sent my baggage forward some days ago & can easily transport my self, but I am really in a comfortable State of confidence that General Washington will be victorious in the next engagement which will probably happen this Evening or to morrow, be that as it may I am ready to go or to remain & may do either with a good face. My advice was not to go, but to prepare for going, that we might not be endangered to have our last moments which ought to be Spent in the most Serious & solemn deliberations & orders, perplexed by a thousand different opinions & reflections how to dispose of our bodies & wordly Estate. We Spent lately upwards of 4 hours in that sort of confusion & considered & reconsidered 4 times, & what was then determined I believe by a reconsideration is now undoing. I came out of the House to forward barely two lines to you & I find I have scribled above twenty-the effect of being at leisure in mind (though hurried by the party who is to be bearer). My baggage is ahead, my Horse is ready, before the Enemy can cross Schuylkill, which I hope he will never do in any character but prisoner, I may be 15 or 20 Miles on Bristol Road & Strike off into the interior Country. Wherever I am I shall endeavor to let you hear from me & will always be wishing the happiness of you & yours. This moment I got here, a friend comes in to dine with me 'till 1/2 past three & in a burst of Laugh tells me we are to meet at 6 oClock this evening & to morrow to enter upon the weighty business of the Confederation. Fright sometimes works Lunacy. This does not imply that Congress is frighted or Lunatic but there may be some Men between this & Schuylkill who may be much one & a little of the other.

Intelligence was received from the General Officer Commanding on Schuylkill that the Enemy were then attempting to cross and that they could not be prevented, and avising the Congress immediately to remove from the City. The movement was made not by a vote but by universal Consent, for every Member Consulted his own particular safety.

  Dear Sir,(1) Philadelphia 20 Sept. 1777. My evil genius tempted me back into this Sodom after I had breakfasted yesterday morning with the other night fugitives at Bristol, I was sure the alarm was not sufficient, though given by the General's aid de camp Hamilton, who said his horse was shot, and one of his oarsmen, and that the enemy could throw a body of troops into the city before morning. I had left some linen in this place and expected some things by a waggon which left Boston the 25th ult, and I had a prospect of serving several gentlemen besides Col R. H. Lee whom I much esteem; therefore to this vile place I returned, and in the last evening had my pocket book stolen with 260 dollars and your tickets, with sundry other papers. I have gained a hint of the book and almanac which were found on a wharf below the Coffee House. It is in possession of a light horse man at Mount Holley in the Jersies, who picked it up in company with a man now in this place. I know not the number of your tickets nor any description, as they  SEPTEMBER 21, 1777  were put up in the memorandum you gave me, and had never been out of my chest till yesterday morning. Forwarn all from purchasing as they will be checked on the books. Send me one of the papers in which you advertize, that I may have the description. The books are all sent away and will not be opened till they return to this City, and I suspect the Lottery will be ruined by this new interruption, if it would otherwise have gone on, but this suspicion is in confidence to yourself.  Commodore Hazelwood went down yesterday to attack some of the enemy's ships which fled from him. General Washington is on this side the Schuylkill. This looks as if there would be no pitched battle. I know not enough of circumstances to praise or absolutely condemn these manoeuvres.  Let me hear from you as soon as possible; be as favorable as you can about my want of care among pick-pockets and tell me how the best may be made of the affair.

  1777 Septr. 21. Sunday It was a false alarm which occasioned our Flight from Philadelphia. Not a Soldier of Howes has crossed the Schuylkill. Washington has again crossed it, which I think is a very injudicious Maneuvre. I think, his Army would have been best disposed on the West Side of the Schuylkill. If he had sent one Brigade of his regular Troops to have heald the Militia it would have been enough. With such a Disposition, he might have cutt to Pieces, Hows Army, in attempting to cross any of the Fords. How will not attempt it. He will wait for his Fleet in Delaware River. He will keep open his Line of Communication with Brunswick, and at last, by some Deception or other will slip unhurt into the City.  Burgoine has crossed Hudsons River, by which Gen. Gates thinks, he is determined at all Hazards to push for Albany, which G. Gates says he will do all in his Power to prevent him from reaching. But I confess I am anxious for the Event, for I fear he will deceive Gates, who seems to be acting the same timorous, defensive Part, which has involved us in so many Disasters.

  Dear Papa, Reading 23d Septr. 1777.  Mr. Smith being returned home and there no representation without me from Maryd. induced me to leave our army yesterday &  SEPTEMBER 23, 1777  proceed to this place; tomorrow I shall set off for Lancaster, distant from this 30 miles. The Congress is to set at Lancaster. By Gen. Howes movements it appears to be his design to force Gen Washington to a battle. This our prudent & worthy General will endeavour to avoid for some time till our army is recovered from their fatigue occasioned by the bad rainy weather & long night marches. Reinforcements too are expected from more quarters than one, and in three weeks, if General Washington can in the mean time avoid fighting, he will I make no doubt be at the head of a strong army. I am sorry to inform you that our discipline by no means answers my expectations, and till that growes better, we must not hope to overcome the enemy tho' much inferior in number. Numbers do not constitute the Strength of an army, unless they be well disciplined. They only serve to breed confusion & disorder. The General has by a late Resolve of Congress great, nay, almost unlimited powers conferred on him. I wish he may use them, unless he does, our affairs will never go well, but he is so humane & delicate that I fear the common cause will suffer from his humanity & delicacy of temper. However I believe he is determined to act with more vigor than heretofore. This man can not be too much admired & lamented. I have no doubts myself but that America will at last succeed. Her armies must be beat into discipline, & public calamity will place at the helm in the different States men who are capable of guiding it. The superficial, the plausible, the noisy, the men merely popular, will be removed, and men of business, of firmness, of resources will succeed them.  Our last accounts from Gates were pleasing. They were dated the 9th instant; he was then at the head of 8000 regulars advancing towards Burgoyne encamped near Fort Miller about 7 miles above Saratoga. Lincoln was in his rear with 5,000 militia, and it was expected than Burgoyne would be obliged to retreat to the lakes, or fight on disadvantageous terms.  Opportunities of writing to you will now be Scarce at least for some time. I believe I shall remain in Congress till my time expires, unless I am sooner superseded by the assembly. When I get settled at Lancaster I shall send Johny home for my winter cloaths & more shirts. My love to Molly & Mrs. Darnall. I am, Yr. affectionate Son,  Ch. Carroll of Carrollton P.S.

  My dear sir Philada. 23d Sepr. [1777] You will have heard before this reaches you that Congress left this City at 3 oClock in the morning of the 19th in Consequence of Advice by Express from Coll. A. Hamilton Genl. Washington's Aid de Camp whose Horse was shot as he was passing the Schuylkill and one also of his Oarsmen was killed. I know not which Way Coll. Dyer & Co. steered after they crossed into the Jersies. I was averse to going at first and after breakfasting at Bristol, Curiosity and some Interest brought me back here to dine the same day. It is said that 4,000 of the Enemy have now actually crossed at the Sweeds Ford. I shall know the Truth before the Post goes off Tomorrow. I have again heard very disagreable accounts of the Necessity of the People in Boston. My Wife now on the Point of Confinement, with 7 Children and unable to get one Loaf of Bread per Day. I must pay £5 per cwt Waggonage from this Place which is the Price asked per cwt for One Commodity (Flour) in Boston. But that is not the worst. I was robbed of my  SEPTEMBER 24, 1777  Pocket Book in the twinkling of an Eye last Friday Eveng. at the Coffee House, containing 260 Dollrs. With 15 or more Lottery Tickets, belonging to Col. Whipple, and some Papers of my own. My Loss of that money effectually joins with the exorbitant Prices in Boston to starve my Family. I must quit in consequence and seek Employ nearer home.  There is a fine Supply of Fireworks and a good Show of Spirit upon the Delaware. If there should not be an abominable deficiency of the latter on the country side Philadelphia will not be lost this tryal. But the Inhabitants cry \""oh that Howe was the present 70 miles from his Ships in New England.\"" There is an amazing Lethargy in these parts. Our Genl. has no Intelligence. Howe has the best Spies & Guides; that villainous Galloway wth. the Allens & several Sherriffs of Counties & 1 Surveyer.  Baltimore was relieved from Fear at 1 o'Clock the 18th the last of the Fleet then going down by the mouth of Patapsco. 20 or 30 Ships had gone down before. In Consequence Govr. Johnston would send more militia to join G. W n and the Virginians also were to do the like, to be ready in case of any mishap. Commodore Hazlewood went down to burn some Ships the 19th at night but they fied. He has orders not to go into Broadwater which perhaps was the wish of the Enemy.(1)  ""

  Sir Philada. 24th Sepr. A.M. [1777] Situated as I am, it would be very unpardonable in me not to give you some sort of history from this quarter.  About 3 o Clock last Friday morning the Members of Congress were warned by an express from one of Genl. Washington's Aids, Coll. Hamilton, to leave this city immediately as the enemy could throw a body of troops into it, some of our boats having fallen into their hands. The Gentleman wrote his letter just after his horse had been disabled, one of his oarsmen killed and another wounded in passing the river Schuylkill. Upon so strong an allarm, with the capture of Govr. McKinley fresh in memory, your Colleagues with their brethren of Congress took to the saddle without loss of time, governed by different fancies as to roads. Mr. S. Adams with others who boarded with me at Mrs. Cheseman's crossed into the Jersies by the middle ferry, as I have heard, to hastily for me to be of that party. I breakfasted at Bristol in a large Company. Mr. Hancock went from thence to Trenton and was soon followed by Mr. J. Adams. Mr. Geary intended to take another road to Reading, when a desire to ascertain the true state of affairs & a little unfinished business of my own, together with a greater quantity for others, brought me back to this place. Finding the city quietted in a degree I remained here to receive the letters expected by the Post from the eastward and to forward if necessary any intelligence of weight by expresses. Last evening we had a most sudden allarm that the enemy were on this side of the Schuylkill in full march towards this city, the militia flying before them. The Officer who commands advised me to remove; but with the Delaware so near at hand I chose to wait for daylight. I will not seal till I have collected the Reports of this morning.(1) In the mean time, however, I will carry you back a few days. I have it from Governour Johnston that the last of the enemy's fleet passed down by the mouth  SEPTEMBER 24, 1777  of Patapsco River at 1 o Clock the 18th, twenty or thirty ships having passed down several days before. He judged Baltimore to be rendered so safe hereby that he intended to send a few additional companies of militia to join Gen. Washington. He also acquainted Govr. Henry to the movement of the ships that the Virginia militia then collected might march so as to be useful in case Howe should move but slowly or we should be unfortunate. Are you not astonished in New England at hearing that the enemy have marched 70 miles, that their ships are rounding the Cape of Cheseapeak to come the Delaware and that day after day passes without even a skirmish? I dare not be more minute as to the causes than only to tell you that the Philadelphians themselves say \""it would not be so in New England, every stone wall would rattle about their ears.\"" I hope, however, you will not give the least entertainment to despair of precious cause. Consider that Galloway, the Allens &c are conducting the enemy thro the most torified tracts assisted by Sherrifs of counties who know all the paths accurately, while our worthy Chief is intirely among foes, who will not or friends who dare not act the part of spies for him. Should the enemy be coming down on this side of Schuylkill from Sweed's ford or higher up the case will be altered, the roads known and the people somewhat faithful to him.  Commodore Hazlewood expected to have had a chance of burning some of the Enemy's Ships last Saturday morning. He fell down the River over night, but his object slipped away, perhaps with intend [intent] to draw him into broad water further down than Chester, but his orders are contrary. There seems to be no want either of fireworks or Manly spirit on the Delaware. Unless there should be a fatal deficiency of the latter on the country part Philadelphia will not go to ruin in this tryal of Sr William & My lord conjunctly.  I am chagrined at not hearing from Genl. Gates 13 days. In his last, he said that \""perhaps few hours will discover whether Mr. Bourgoine will risque a Battle or slip back to Tyconderoga.\"" That letter reached us in 3 days.  You will be affected by not receiving News papers from hence. The failure of them makes a general melancholy impression. We took early care to remove types as a valuable article. I can scarcely read yr eastern papers now, the types are so blount with use. Let the people know that the Papers are not stopped by Congress to \""conceal bad news\"" as Tories used to propagate last winter.  Upon enquirey I find from Coll Hamilton that a small party of Hessians & Light Horse crossed about 18 miles up the River and there remain! Scandalous! The militia here seem to turn out only for the pay, without Intention to fight at all. Genl. Washington is at Monotamy watching the main body of the Enemy which lays at Potsgrove on the opposite bank of Schuylkill 35 miles from this. He will not expose his baggage & stores, laying in the neighbourhood of Read-  ing, to save this City from a Fright or even Destruction, finding the Inhabitants of the State do not think it worth strugling for.  The city post master slipped away last evening to Bristol, and I am suddenly called on by the postmaster of the army.  Peletiah Webster who intends to remain here urged me to take from him 200 Dollars, money belonging to our State. I did it without Authority, having been bro't to want it by a villainous Pickpocket last Friday evening, who took my Book wth. 260 Dollars and a Number of Lottery Tickets I think 15 belonging to Col. Whipple. My Family was in want before. This Blow will oblidge me to quit, here, and return speedily to seek some mode of aiding them nearer home.  The Evening Post has nothing new; nor was there any thing interesting in a packet which I recd. 3 days ago from the Hague of June 11th.(2) Both French & Dutch seem to be waiting till we are free & independent by our exertions, and then they will dare to feel so themselves.  I am, with much Regard, Sir, Your Friend & humb Servt. James Lovell  [P.S.] I believe the Chester Letter writer of Sepr. 12th has aggrivated the Enemy's loss of General officers, otherwise his account is tollerable.  ""

They marched immediately towards Philada & I imagine their advanced parties will be near that City to Night. They had so far got the Start before I reced certain Intelligence that any considerable Number had crossed, that I found it in vain to think of overtaking their Rear with Troops harrassed as ours had been with constant Marching since the Battle of Brandewyne, & therefore concluded by the advice of all the General officers to march from this place (near Potts Grove) tomorrow Morning towards Philadelphia, & on the Way endeavor to form a Junction with the Continental Troops under General McDougal from Peekskill & the Jersey Militia under Genl. Dickinson, both of whom are, SEPTEMBER 25, 1777  I hope, on this Side the Delaware. I am also obliged to wait for Genls. Wayne & Smallwood who were left upon the other Side of the Schuilkill in Hopes of falling upon the Enemy's Rear, but they have eluded them as well as Us.\"" This Extract from G.W. to Congress.(2)  We hear the Enemies advanced parties entered the City yesterday Evening.  About 1000 of G. Washington's army are without Shoes & Stockings. About 500 of Genl. Waynes Division lost theirs & their Blankets in the late shameful Surprise. We lost 272 dead, prisoners, wounded & missing in that affair. Our Militia behaved very ill, many of them were run quite off with their Arms. Our officers behaved remarkably well. Would it not be(3) proper to take Measures to carry them back?  One Higginson, who once lived at Annapolis, went to Saml. & thence run away, has been concerned in a Conspiracy at fort Pitt, he is well known to Whetcroft, Quynn. It is highly expedient that he be secured as soon as possible. Genl. Hand has sent after him, but it is probable he will get to the Eastern Shore.  The president is not arrived, he will be here this Evening. He has a Letter from Genl. Gates-Nothing important in that Quarter. He has about 7000 & Lincoln about 5000.

  Sir (1) Lancaster Septemr. 26th 1777 As the future safety of Philadelphia and the public good so greatly depend upon preventing the enemies Fleet from getting up to Town and succoring the Army, you are desired to co-operate in the most full and freindly manner with the Other Land and Sea forces both of the Continental and the state of Pennsylvania in effecting this valuable purpose. It is expected that you exert every art that valour, vigilance and address can suggest to you, as well as to prevent the enemy from Philadelphia possessing themselves of the Fort, as to keep the British Fleet from getting up. If there should be a probability of either provisions or ammunition failing you, let timely care be taken to get supplied from General Washington who with his Army will be in the neighbourhood of Philadelphia above the City. If the Fort and the passage of the River is bravely and properly defended, the possession of Philada will probably turn out to be the ruin of the British Army.  Your established reputation for valour makes it unnecessary to say that brave minds should never despair, and that every thing is to be hazarded where the public good require it. You and the brave American forces with you, will therefore keep the defences on the River Delaware to the last extremity. But, if every resource of valour and skill should fail you, and it becomes absolutely impossible to hold out any longer, you are then to push with the Continental Vessels as far as they can swim up the River, and having defended them there as long as possible, they must all be destroyed rather than suffer them to fall into the enemies hands. If it should be found that Fort Mifflin must be given up, you are then to use your utmost endeavours to bring off the garrison and convoy the Troops to a place of safety. Congress has already determined that in defending the Delaware the Continental Marine Officers shall be under command of the Commodore of this State, and you are accordingly to observe and pay due regard to that Resolve.  SEPTEMBER 27, 1777  Wishing you the most honourable success, We are sir, Your hble servants  ""

We have no doubt but that your joint and vigourous efforts will be employed to defend the passage of the River to the last extreamity and if at last it must be given up, it is expected that you will assist in removing the Troops from Fort Mifflin to a place of safety.

Mr. Peters moreover informs me that to his certain knowledge several of these cartridges boxes were converted by the soldiers into cantenes & by some officers into shaving boxes.

I am sorry to observe that two officers in high command in our army are said to be much addicted to liquor: what trust, what confidence can be reposed in such men? They may disconcert the wisest & best laid plans: such men ought to be removed from their command & the army, for their example, besides the mischief which may be occasioned by a clouded & muddled brain, will have a pernicious influence on others: but how are they to be removed from their command?

  Dear Sir Lancaster Septr. the 28th 1777 I received yours of the 8th Instant on the road to this place & of the 16th by Stores yesterday. Am rejoyced to hear Mrs Dyer is in a fair way of recovery & the rest of my family well. Since my last wherein I Informed you of the Situation of the two Armies this way & of the Battle at Brandewine & the hopes we then entertained that the Enemy could never penetrate the Country & possess themselves of the (great) Capital of this State yet all this they have done & without any loss or may say almost without a gun being fired at them since instead of the Country rising for their defence & surrounding & harrassing the Enemy in every Movement the Militia which were Collected have principally run of [f] & left the Genll with his Continental forces to shurk for himself. This State is torn to peices by factions in Government, Quaker, Dunker, Milese & Moravians in religion whose principles not only prevent them from fighting but Induces them to disaffect others & to give all possible Aid to the Enemy (Moravians excepted). We had large Stores at Reading and at many places back in the Country, at one time Genll Howe would seem to aim at them, & then again make a sudden trek toward the City, tho it would appear afterward to be only feints & by parties while his main body lay still & at rest. These appearances put Genll Washington Continually on the March sometimes one way & sometimes another to Counteract his designs by which his Troops become fatigued & wore out & dispirited. How seems to be among his friends favoured with every advantageous Intelligence & supplied with every Necessary & Conveniencie both of Provission & Carriage while Genll Washington being in the midst of his Enemies & those disaffected to the Cause was deficient in both. Twice he determined to give the Enemy Battle but Unhappily dissapointed in both the first by an excessive rain, which entirely wet & ruined all the Cartridges of his Army with which they were provided in order to Attack the Enemy by break of day, which not only prevented the proposed Attack but oblidged him to march  SEPTEMBER 28, 1777  his whole Army back into the Country 15 or 16 miles from the Enemy to recruit his Arms & Amunition. That left the Enemy so far advanced between him & the City & nothing but the difficulty of passing the Schuylkill (then raised by the rains) prevented their Marching directly into the City & by an express who came into the City about one oClock on the morning of Fryday the 19th Instant Informing the Enemy had passed the Schuylkill & was then on their full March for the City, Noticing the Congress Members Immediately to leave the City, & that they had not a minute to spare tho this proved a mistake You may depend upon it we were soon on the Wing & made our flight with all speed to Trenton where we arrived early that day. From Thence we journeyd to Bethlem & through Reading to Lancaster to which place we had agreed (1) to adjourn Congress when there should be Need, but we only met there to Adjourn to this place where we Open Congress this day. We thought it not best at this time to remove out of this State least in this Critical Situation of affairs there should be a total defection of this State. The Enemy are now in possession of their Capital which they entered on Fryday last with a party of about 15 hundred & with their main body are fortifying on the heights near German Town. Genll Washington is now reinforced with McDougles Brigade from the Peekskills, by some Jersey Militia with about 2000 from Maryland & about the same Number from Virginia which last are now come forward on the road & others passing thro this place to join him. He must now have a large Army but hast lost all the Advantages he has had Against the Enemy in their March, but yet are not without hopes that he may still dislodge the Enemy, before their fleet arrives up the river. We have a large Number of row gallies, fire ships &c in the river to give them at least one blast when they come. I receivd a letter from Benjn with yours in which he wrote to me to send him a quantity of drugs from Philadelphia but it was not received till after I left the City & the Enemy were in possession. Otherwise if he had sent to me some time agoe he might have been supplied with all the Articles he sent for. He must blame himself for his delay. I hear Nothing from Coll Thos.

Howe had not got into Pha. last Thursday: his army lay between German Town & the city. I do not believe he will trust himself in Pha. before another battle is fought. His shipping cannot come up till the fort is taken & the cheveaux de frise raised. The last letter from Gates was dated the 15th instant. Burgoyne was on the west side of North river: Lincoln in his rear with 5000 on the east side: Gates in the West side, but had 13 bridges to build before he could get at Burgoyne, or Burgoyne at him, so that no action could happen between them before the 25th of the month or thereabouts. If our northern army can be kept together, I think with prudent management Burgoyne will find it equal difficult to retreat or advance. The State of Pena. is either disaffected, or its Governt.

  York Town Pensylvania, My best Friend Septr. 30. 1777 Tuesday  It is now a long Time, since I had an Opportunity of writing to you, and I fear you have suffered unnecessary Anxiety on my Account. In the Morning of the 19th Inst., the Congress were allarmed, in their Beds, by a Letter from Mr. Hamilton one of General Washingtons Family, that the Enemy were in Possession of the Ford over the Schuylkill, and the Boats, so that they had it in their Power to be in Philadelphia, before Morning. The Papers of Congress, belonging to the Secretary's Office, the War Office, the Treasury Office, &c. were before sent to Bristol. The President, and all the other Gentlemen were gone that Road, so I followed, with my Friend Mr. Merchant of Rhode Island, to Trenton in the Jersies. We stayed at Trenton, untill the 21 when We set off, to Easton upon the Forks of Delaware. From Easton We went to Bethlehem, from thence to Reading, from thence to Lancaster, and from thence to this Town, which is about a dozen Miles over the Susquehannah River. Here Congress is to sit.  In order to convey the Papers, with safety, which are of more Importance than all the Members, We were induced to take this Circuit, which is near 180 Miles, whereas this Town by the directest Road is not more than 88 Miles from Philadelphia. This Tour has given me an Opportunity of seeing many Parts of this Country, which I never saw before.  This Morning Major Throop arrived here with a large Packett from General Gates, containing very agreable Intelligence,(1) which I need not repeat, as you have much earlier Intelligence from that Part than We have.  I wish Affairs here wore as pleasing an Aspect. But alass they do not.  I shall avoid every Thing like History, and make no Reflections.  However, General Washington is in a Condition tolerably respectable, and the Militia are now turning out, from Virginia, Maryland and Pensilvania, in small Numbers. All the Apology that can be made, for this Part of the World is that Mr. Howes march from Elke to Philadelphia, was thro the very Regions of Passive obedience. The whole Country thro which he passed, is inhabited by Quakers. There is not such another Body of Quakers in all America, perhaps not in all the World.  I am still of Opinion that Philadelphia will be no Loss to Us.  I am very comfortably situated, here, in the House of General Roberdeau, whose Hospitality has taken in Mr. S[amuel] A[dams], Mr. G[erry] and me. My Health is as good as common, and I assure you my Spirits not the worse for the Loss of Philadelphia.  Biddle in the Continental Frigate at S. Carolina has made a noble Cruise and taken four very valuable W.I. Prizes. SEPTEMBER 30, 1777  Continue to write me by the Post, and I shall pay my Debts.  ""

I met the Congress on Saturday last at Lancaster, & upon consultation it was judged most prudent to adjourn to this place, where we now are & where we can deliberate & prosecute business without interruption, & where your dispatches will meet us.  I have just now reciev'd by general Gates's Aid de Camp (Major Troup) sundry Letters, Copies of which I have the honour to inclose you, by which it appears that our affairs in the northern department wear a favourable aspect, and I hope soon to transmit you an Account of an issue to the contest in that quarter.  I wish soon to receive the most pleasing accounts from you, we are in daily expectation of agreeable tidings, & that Genl. Howe is totally reduced.

  Dear Sir. York Town Pennsylvania Sept 30. 1777 I take the liberty to inform your Excellency that Congress have at last fixed themselves in this Town, where they in all probability will remain for some time. An express has been this day received from Genl Gates, who informs Congress of an action which happened on the 19th Instant, within three miles of Stillwater, between our army under his command and that of the Enemy under Genl Burguoyn. It continued several hours, but night put a stop to it. Both armies retreated to their Encampments leaving the field to be again disputed on another day. The left wing of our Army was only engaged against the whole of the British and most of the Foreign Troops. A heavy and brisk fire was kept up on both sides, we had 2 Lieut Colls, 3 Captains, 3 Subs, 2 Sergeants, 2 drummers and phifers, and 51 rank & file killed. Several officers and 180 odd wounded. The Enemy's loss was very considerable supposed to be at least 1200 killed and wounded. It is said by Prisoners and Deserters that Genl Burguoin received a wound in his shoulder. His situation is so very critical that we have the most sanguine expectation of hearing in a few days of his meeting with a total defeat. Genl Lincoln has taken by a party sent from his army 200 Battallions [i.e. Batteaux] on lake George and Lake Champlaine, upwards of 200 prisoners with their arms, and released 100 of our men who were prisoners in that Quarter, and it is supposed a successful attack will be made on Ticonderoga very soon. I wish I had it in my power to give your Excellency as pleasing an account of our affairs in this Quarter, Genl Howe is, or can be in possession of Philadelphia when he pleases. Genl Washington's army are upon Schuylkill, betwixt Reading & Philadelphia, a reinforcement of 1500 Regulars under Genl. McDugal has joined him, and upwards of 2000 Virginians are on their march for the same purpose. And it is believed Genl Washington will march to Philadelphia, or near it, and that another general Battle will be fought in a few days. The Enemy are not as yet in possession of the River. Our Troops and armed Vessels intend to defend the Fort to the last extremity. A firing was heard on Saturday last, which continued some hours, supposed to be between some of the Enemy's ships and the Fort. The particulars have not as yet been received by Congress. I shall be very happy to receive a line from you as often as you can find leisure. SEPTEMBER 30, 1777  Messrs Burke & Penn are not yet arrived, but I expect them every hour. I am with great respect, Your Excellency's most Obt huml Servt. Cornl Harnett  ""

  Dr. Sr. York, 30th Sept. 1777. I have your Phaeton here though I was obliged to send for it after I left Philadelphia being put to the rout the night I recd your Letter.(1) The bolt that fastens the pole & part of the long reins were lost, some brass nails also gone, and the lining much dirted and in some places torn. I will get these little matters repaired and have the carriage and Harness kept clean and in as good order as I can, which is the least I can do for the use, though I wod. much rather buy it if you are not determined agt. selling, and submit the price to yourself or our Friend Colo. Harrison, who may view it and pay the Cash Upon demand to your Order. The Harness I observe is not matched, though the difference is not very striking. Whether this happened at Philadelphia since you left it there, or before You can judge. We have met upon the road many Companies of Virga. Militia and more are coming, though I am informed numbers are gone back, in consequence of your Letter respecting those unarmed.(2) I observe they are in general bare of cloathing, wch if possible shod. be furnished them, and their stay at Camp made as comfertable as circumstances will admit, that when they return Home they may not go disgusted spreading evil reports, greatly to the prejudice of the recruiting service and the cause in general. These Men come far to support the Rights and property of an invaded State, that makes little or no exertions in its own defence, but on the contrary afford every succour and support to the Enemy, and rather than they shod. want necessaries or any other part of the Army at this and the approaching inclement season, I wod. not scruple to take all such necessaries from the disaffected where ever found. Our Friends are striped by our Enemies wherever they go, and our Foes freely furnish them what they want. What the last have left usefull to the Army I wod. take, and where the first are so exposed to the Enemy as that what necessaries they have must unavoidably fall into their hands, I wod. demand a surrender of them, paying the value or giving Certificates, assigning the reason of proceeding. The Enemy subsist their Army at our Expence, drawing supplies from around them as they pass. I Wod. subsist our Army from around it as far as possible, and in the rout of the Enemy. These are my private sentiments which I communicate without reserve, to be regarded or disregarded by you as you shall judge best. I own to you this Conduct wod. often hurt my feelings,  SEPTEMBER 30, 1777  as I am satisfied in many instances it must yours but where I was satisfied the public good wod. result from the measure, I shod. endeavour to stifle those emotions of Humanity and Tenderness for individual distress, which in different circumstances wod. claim my attention and benevolence. In times like the present and in situations like ours, Rigour to internal Foes is absolutely necessary, and I think has been too long delayed. To Friends I wod afford every possible support and protection, to Tories and equivocal Characters I wod. yield the measure meeted by the Enemey to our Friends. I think this is the general Sentiment of our Body, and of almost every Whig I converse with. How far you can prevail on yourself to carry them into execution your own feelings must determine. The right of retaliation cannot be disputed, and it is equally just and wise to benefit ourselves of those necessaries wch. it is probable shod. we neglect to do so, may advantage the Enemy. In pursuing this line individuals may suffer hardship, but it is a sacrifice our friend shod. willingly make in the general good. Pray excuse these loose thoughts, I offer them with freedom. You are equally free to disregard them. Success and happiness attend you.  Yr. affect Servt. Jos. Jones  [P.S.] Gibsons Battalion came in today. They are but thin.  ""

  Honored Sir, York, State of Pensylvania, Sepr. 30th. 1777 Fryday Morning Congress left the City of Philadelphia, in Consequence of the British Armys gaining the Banks of Schuylkill at a fording Place about 17 miles from the City, They have since possessed themselves of the City. Genl. Washington from the Enemys movements expected they were determined to cross over at a considerable Distance further up, and indeed that they meant an Attack upon Redding where we had Considerable Stores. In short the number of fording Places it seems rendered it impracticable to hinder their passing. How entered the City last Thursday. Genl. Washington is approaching the City. His army are daily reinforcing. Genl. McDougall joind him with 1500 New Engd. Continentals & six hundred Jersey millitia. The Virginians are marching down thro' this Town daily with great Spirit. We have still the Possession of the River & have reinforced strongly Fort Island which defends the Cheveau de Frize. This with the Floating Batteries, Fire Ships and Gallies we are in Hopes will be a Defence against Hows Fleet should they attempt to come up. And Our army in the Rear must cutt off all Resources from the Enemys army, till it shall be thought expedient to make a general Attack. I think they are well disposed of, till they are better disposed of.  I congratulate you Sir upon Our Successes at the Northward, and the general Prospect we have of completing a glorious Campaign.

  Hond Sir York 30 Sepr 1777 Having in a joint Letter of this Date given you an Acco. of our present Situation & the Circumstances of public Affairs in these parts, have not much to add.(1) It is long since I have heard from you or my dear Friends in Lebanon & Connecticut, which gives me much Pain. I wod gladly have come home to see & find how They were &c instead of the tedious circum round about Journey of 160 or 70 miles to this Place, had I not been sensible the Tongue of slander wod have been busie; I intended when I came from home to have returned in Octo.  SEPTEMBER 30, 1777  but the Events which have taken place, oblige me to postpone it a little longer, but hope to return soon, if it please God, the road may be safe, & have great hope the Affairs at the Northward will be happy which will also contribute greatly to alter their situation in this quarter for the better.  Majr. Troup, G Gates's Aid De Camp, came in this day with Letters from him &c which seem to exhillerate the Spirits of Congress, quite enow & indeed they were not too much depresd before, strongly hoping & expecting a reverse. I wish our Confidence was more placed & founded on the infinite Mercy & Goodness of God, & less on vain self Confidence & Sufficiency, but I hope God has great & merciful Designs for Us, notwithstandg. our infinite unworthiness.  I intended at Philadelpa. to have wrote a Letter of Resignation to our Assembly, lest They shod reelect me for a Delegate (tho probably there wod have been no danger) but being driven to this Distance it may be impossible for me to get home in season especially if We shod be worsted at the Northwd & to be here without business wod be painful enow & believe I shall neglect it. They will do as they please but I have no Wish nor Design to attend again, sometime, if ever I shod be desired.(2)  The People of this State appear to be very many of them, weary of the Stagnation of Business, by the shutting up the Ports whereby They have so much lost their Gain, which seems to be all the God they know & are disaffected to the Cause for that & governmental & other Causes. They despise Continental Money, & take it only thro fear, & most extravagant quantitys for Trifles. It is worse at Lancaster than at Phila. & not better here, tho I think the People are of a better Disposition in some respects. The Town complain that they suffer in the midst of great Plenty, & there never was greater of the precious Fruits of the Earth; but the farmers refuse to bring in or to sell, unless for Salt & other necessaries. They say they get a Load of wood here for one Silver Dollar, & must give four continental & so in proportion. Fine broad Cloths are £12 per yard &c here. I hope a heavy Tax will tend to reduce things to order which Congress will certainly recommend very soon. A Comte had been appointed to prepare, apportion &c at P. but we were obliged to decamp before it was brot in.(3) Tho nothing but Success against our Enemys will effectually extricate us from the Distresses respecting our Currency &c into which we are plunged. May God grant us Salvation for his own great Mercy & Name Sake & enable Us to Say not unto Us &c for I am sure we dont deserve it. I had but a faint Idea of the wickedness of the Country till I had traveled to this Country, seen & heard so much of & from the middle & southern parts. Well may we admire & adore the infinite Patience & long suffering of our God.(4) ""

  Sir York Town Octr. 1. 1777 I had the Honour of your Excellency's Letter of the 28th Ultimo which I recd. but this Day.(1) I have attended to the Business you were pleased to recommend as far as Circumstances will admitt & shall use every Exertion in my Power convinced as I am of the Necessity of adding every possible Strength to the Army at this important Juncture. I have given Directions for the Route of the Troops agreeable to your Request & have supperadded what I thought would conduce to accelerate their March. I have desired the Officers commanding Detachments to send their heavy Baggage to the Ford & take every possible Means to lighten the Troops & force their March as far as is consistent with the Health & Spirits of the Men. They are desired to impress Waggons to carry on the lame & fatigued as they go along. I wish I could give you better Accounts of the Virginia Militia than that great Numbers of them are but illy provided with Arms & Necessaries. The Men seem to be good & I make no Doubt will use such Materials as they have to their own Honour & the Advantage of the Cause. I could wish indeed they had the Arms which are in the Hands of other Militia who have not behaved with that Spirit & Firmness which the Salvation of their own Country demanded. I would mention to your Excellency that I think it best to station an Officer at the Ford above the Mouth of French Creek to direct the further progress of the Troops. If such an one can be had at Lancaster he will be sent but lest a Proper Person cannot be found there would it not be better for your Excellency to send one? The Militia gone thro' this Town & which are by Detachment on their Way are those of Fairfax, Prince William, Loudon, Berkely, Culpepper & Faquier  amtg to about 1200 (Continental) Part of Gibson Regt, about 400 well provided  1600  Those of Frederick & Dunmore Counties are coming on & it is said in OCTOBER 1, 1777  larger Proportions than the Rest. We are also informed that recruiting goes on well in Virginia & that a considerable Number of continental Troops (Recruits) are on their Way. One hundred & ten arrived this Day, but naked & unarmed & how they & the Rest are to be armed & equipped is yet a Mystery. Could not the Arms be taken from the sick & given to those who are well. Chester County would afford a great supply of Blanketts if they were taken from the disaffected; & it is to be wished Mr Mease would appoint some Place for delivering out Cloathing. Shoes are engrossed all over the Country & can be obtained upon no Terms but such as are extravagant except they are siezed & paid for at a reasonable Price. I enclose a Letter from Major Nicholas who was sent for the Arms at Springfield & Brookfield & altho it appeared from the Returns now in the Office that there were at least 6,000, your Excellency will see how difficult it has been to obtain the Number mentioned in the Letter.(2) How this can happen is difficult to determine. The Board request you will be pleased to send off Orders to Major Nicholas what he shall do with the Arms & any Stores he may bring. It is rather Malapropos to bring Stores into this State at this Time. General Heath should be ordered to send all the Arms he keeps for the Regts to be raised & let them be delivered to those which are raised. The Arms kept in Connecticut In Case of an Invasion should be ordered where there is actually an Invasion as I concieve. But no Doubt some Order will be taken in this Matter. Will your Excellency be pleased to direct what shall be done with the Recruits who cannot from all Appearances be armed & clothed here? As the Board meet but irregularly owing to Matters not being in a proper Train here yet, I have suggested much of this Letter to Your Excellency & if there be too much Haste & Egotism you will be pleased to excuse it & believe me to be with the greatest Respect Your Excellency's very obed. & most hble Servt,  Richard Peters P.S. By a Letter from Major Nicholas since writing the above it seems that Col. Cheevers is on his Way with 2,000 Stands of Arms beside those intended to be brought by the Major. As I have no Assistant my Deputy not being here it will prevent my Attention to the forwarding the Troops in the Manner I could wish as I am & shall be much engaged in the Arrangement of the Office for a few Days when I shall be ready to execute with the greatest Industry & readiness any Commands your Excellency may be pleased to honour me with. I shall forward the Troops as they arrive here to Lancaster & if I hear of any Difficulties there shall go thither to surmount them as far as I can.(3)  ""

The Express give a verbal account that two Spys were decoied by some Continental Troops round our Genl. Clinton's Quarters habited like unto the Brittish Soldiers for the very purpose. The Spy's asked when they landed, they were told the day before-where Gen.

Washington in order to destroy those Stores, and there being many fording Places on the Schuylkill Genl. Washington was obliged to string his Army for twenty Miles on said River, which weakened him to such a Degree, together with the frequent Marches and counter Marches of the Enemy, that when they crossed over Genl. Washington was fifteen Miles above them, without a possibility of overtaking them.  However He is now reinforced with 1000 Men from Peekskill commanded by Genl. McDougall, One Battallion of the State Troops of Virginia, and 1000 of Their Millitia. 1000 more are on their March and will join the Army in a few Days. Also 1000 from Maryland, and some Jersey Millitia have also joined the Army. By a Letter from Genl. Washington he informed Us that in a few Days he intended to attack the Enemy,(1) that his Troops were in good Spirits, and altho' the Enemy had got into Phila. yet he did not doubt he should be able to give a good account of Them. And as we are in Possession of the  OCTOBER 2, 1777  River Deleware with Fire Ships, Fire Rafts, Gallie Floating Batteries &c we doubt not but Mr. How's Situation will be made very disagreable to Him.

When the Board meets, I shall propose a Reversal of the Order.(2)  The Loss of Philadelphia was unexpected, & had it been in any other State than Pennsylvania, Delaware or Maryland, I question whether it would have happened, but as General Washington's Army will be reinforced in a Day or two with 3000 of the Virginia Militia, 1500 Continental Troops from Peeks Kill & 1000 of the Jersey militia, I hope it will be soon recovered.  The new Commissaries do not appear to be well acquainted with their Business, the army having been one whole Day without provisions.

With her help I expect they will demolish the other Ships & Fire Craft &c &c which were confident of defending the river, near the Cheavaux de Frize & soon have their Fleet in possession of it. If true, language cant express my Feelings towd the accursed Villain.(1)  Capt Biddle of the Randolph, has just carrd in to Charlestown S.

  Dear Sir, York Town. October 3d. 1777 In my last, a few Days ago, by Express, I transmitted to you the Intelligence from the North, since which We have heard Nothing from that Quarter. I flatter Myself the Campain there will close with Honor and Success; indeed I am so sanguine as to expect to hear of the total Defeat of Burgoyne. I beleive I enclosed You the amount of our Army under Genl Gates, on the 15 of Septr. Total 6,618 Rank & files, 664 Commd. officers, 718 Serjeants, 308 Drums & fifes, Artillery 158, fit for Duty, Sick present 317, Sick absent 1384. These are Regulars. Under Genl. Lincoln is about 5000 Militia.  We have not heard from Genl. Washington since the 29 Septr. Our army is marching towards the City.  If our assembly should meet, I submit to you the propriety of Recommending a Draft from the Militia to recruit our Quota, I suppose the Trial must be made of a small part, e.g., a fifteenth, which will produce 2000. The time of service must not be for less than a Year, and I suppose Substitutes will be accepted. Can any Mode but a Draft, be adopted?  It will be absolutely necessary to fall on some Measures to furnish our Militia & Quota with Arms, and the latter with Cloaths & Tents &c &c. I know but of two ways to effect it, by Importation, & by Manufacturing, the former by Trade will not probably answer. I would propose to send or employ an agent at the Courts of Versailles & Madrid to apply to each of those Courts to supply our State wth 10,000 Stand of good Arms, 20 brass field Pieces from 4 to 12 pounders, 10 Howits from 6 to 9 Inches, Cloathing compleat for 5000 Men and Ravens Duck for Tents for that Number of Soldiers, 10,000 pair of Stockings & 10,000 pair of Shoes to be sent in a frigate of force, at the Risque & to be paid for by the State in produce within three Years after the End of the present War with Great Britain.  I would have the Govr. & Council authorised to give not exceeding 20 Dollars for each Stand of arms in our State, & would exempt all persons actually employed in particular Manufactories from all military Duty.  Our Confederacy is to be resumed this Day.  I know You will receive this Letter in the same friendly Manner it is wrote & therefore offer no apology for it. Farewell. Your affectionate and Obedt.

  Sir York Town Pensylvania, 3d October 1777 I wrote to your Excellency from Lancaster covering a Copy of General Washington's Letter to Congress which explains the Causes of the Loss of Philadelphia.(1) I wish these dispatches may have got safe to hand. Congress at their first meeting at Lancaster adjournd to York Town 22 miles further Southward, and ten from the Susquehanna. Lancaster they found crowded and in other Respects exceptionable; Here we are at least sufficiently retird, & can deliberate without Interruption. It was much against my Inclinations that at so advancd a season, and destitute of winter Cloaths and after a long absence from my Family, I found it necessary to come forward, least our State shoud be unrepresented and my Constituents offended. I depend on your Excellency's Attention to get me relievd. Since the first sitting of the second Congress, which is now upwards of two years & five months, I have not on the whole spent four months with my Family. My feelings as a husband and a Parent are hurt upon the Reflection and I hope I may without Presumption say that my past Services entitle me to some Indulgence: and that it is not unreasonable to ask a little time to repair the waste which, from my total neglect of every thing which related to myself, has been made in my private Affairs.  Yesterday I had the Honour of receiving your Excellency's dispatches of the 18th & 22d Instant. We cannot be sufficiently thankful to the Supreme Being for rescuing our bleeding Country from the Calamities of an Indian war which threatned our western frontier with ruin and desolation. That under Heaven it was saved by the valor and good Conduct of our own Countrymen is an additional Satisfaction. Every mouth is full of the Praises of Herkemer, Gansevoort, & Willet. The Victory acquird by General Starke was as seasonable, as glorious, and is the more eminently distinguished as it was gaind by Militia over veteran and experiencd Troops; and tho' nothing decisive has taken place between the grand armies under General Gates and General Burgoine, the late gallant Behaviour of the left wing of our Army, with the Embarrassments which surround the British Troops & the Superiority of our Forces, give us the highest reason to look up to divine Providence for a Happy issue of the Campaign in that Quarter. God graciously grant the full scope of your wishes, \""that it may conduce to render the present Campaign decisive.\""  The Army under General Washington receives accessions of Strength daily; a Continental Battalion and considerable Bodies of militia have passed thro' this place from Virginia. More are expected from Maryland and from New Jersey. This state alone is sunk into supineness and inaction from which even the loss of their Capitol has  OCTOBER 3, 1777  not been able to rouse them 1 It's new Constitution and laws are unfit for this tempestuous Season: It's Governor inexperiened, and as appears to me, unsupported. Many of the leading Whiggs are disgusted and view the storm at a distance with Sullen Concern; and no proper means are exerted as far as 1 can see, to reanimate the sluggish spirits of the people, oppose the successful Efforts of the disaffected, or to draw forth the vast Strength of this State, which of itself is able to crush General Howe's slender army, humanly speaking, into the Dust. This I fear sir, is but too just a picture of this once formidable government.  ""

  Dear Sir, York Octr 3d 1777 Removed thus far more distant from you than the Head Quarters of our Army, you cannot expect so early Intelligence of military movements from me as from Persons near the General.

  Dr. Papa, York 5th Oct. 1777. My last gave you an account of the fight between Gates & Burgoyne; we have not recd. since any news from that quarter from whence I presume Burgoyne did not renew his attack between the 19th & 20th for had another battle been fought in that interval the news would have reached Congress before this time; and I also conclude from this inaction of Burgoyne that his army must have suffered considerably in the conflict of the 19th, & perhaps he himself may  OCTOBER 5, 1777  have been wounded. To judge from appearances, the spirits of our army in that quarter, & of the eastern & New York militia, our affairs in that department are likely to end happily; I wish I could say as much for the middle department. Docr. Howard, who left this yesterday, & the army but two days ago will give an account of it. I am Sorry to say that the discipline of it, while I remained with it, appeared extreamly defective. In a word till this army undergoes a thorough reformation by cashiering Several officers & some in high command, by casting several regiments into one, by reforming Several abuses & the introduction of some new & wholesome regulations, we must not look for its doing any thing considerable. While I was with the army two opportunities were offered to Howe of cutting it to pieces; his not embracing those opportunities convinces me that he either wants intelligence, which however I believe is not the case, or that he is very weak, or a bad general. I am inclined most to believe that his army is weak; yet if it be true that we hear, that he has made such considerable detachments from it, he must have a sovereign contempt for ours. We have no later intelligence from Gen. Washington than what is contained in his letter of the 29th last informing Congress of his resolution of moving towards Pha.  The Congress still continues the same noisy, empty & talkative assembly it always was since I have known it. No progress has been made in the Confederation tho' all seem desirous of forming one. A good confederation I am convinced would give us great strength & new vigor. This State is in a great degree disaffected, & the well affected are inactive & supine. This supiness & inactivity I attribute to the government & to the men who govern; they want wisdom, influence, & the confidence of a very great portion of the People, particularly of those whose abilities & activity might in short time set things to rights. The Assembly was to sit at Lancaster, but they had not the day before yesterday made a house, my hope is they will not, & that a Convention will take place. The Quakers, Dunkers, & Menonists are almost to a man against us, and I believe they make near a 1/4 part of the whole People.  This letter I shall deliver to Col. Lloyd, who came here yesterday & he shall set off tomorrow for Annapolis.  I have only recd. two letters from you Since I left Doohoragen, the last was dated the 17th past. Col Lloyd informs me that the Enemy landed on Poplar Island & took away some of our People & stock, but his account seems to be very imperfect & therefore I hope not true. Pray let me know in your next whether they have done any damage on the Island, & whether Sears continues to make salt there. How do the carpenters go on in Annapolis? I hope the pavillions are covered in, & the window frames put up, or planks to prevent the rain from driving in. Has Dorsey as yet assessed Doohoragen Manor? Let me know what he has assessed it at.   A post is now established between this place & Baltimore but the days of his arrival & departure are not yet fixed with that precision one could wish; however your letters lodged with Miss Goddard will come safe to me. I wish you a long continuance of your health and remain, Yr. most affectionate Son,  Ch. Carroll of Carrollton ""

  Dear General York Town 5t Octr. 1777 I did not receive your favour of the 16th Instant 'till this day. In the Interim Major Troup arrived with an Account of the Battle between the American & British Armies near Saraghtoga on the l9th and of some advantages gaind by Col. Brown near the Lakes. It amounts at least to a Check of General Burgoine in his Career towards Albany. I am however sensible that the Fate of the British Army can not be decided but at the Hazard of another Battle: the Event of which I wait with an anxious Heart; hoping however that with the Blessing of Providence the superiority which we have in numbers may be improvd to the salvation of my dear Country  General Howe has had the good Fortune to make himself master of Philada. without our Army's being able to give him a second battle or oppose His progress. A Deluge of Rain which fell the Instant the two armies were ready to engage a second time, and which besides completely destroying General Washington's ammunition, reduced him to a necessity of retiring to some distance from the Enemy- gave General Howe the wishd for Opportunity of marching towards Philad. uninterrupted; and the dispersion of General Waine's division (which had been left to harrass the Enemy in the Rear while our main body was endeavoring by forced marches to present themselves in the front, to dispute the passage of the Schuylkill) suddenly effected by a Successful Attack of a superior party of the Enemy in the night, in which he was in fact routed tho' without any considerable Loss; left it in Gl. Howe's power to improve to the utmost Advantage the good Fortune he had Just before derivd from the Deluge. General Washington is reinforcing his Army by an Accession of Troops from the Southward and New Jersey, in addition to General McDougald's Brigade. His Troops have not been much diminished by Battle, but have suffered extremely from the fateigue of Severe marching. Indeed I am of Opinion he must in the Course of a week have more men F than he commanded when he went out to meet G Howe, While all acounts agree that in the bloody battle of the Brandywine the OCTOBER 5, 1777  Enemy lost in killed and wounded 1970; besides Desertions & those who fell in skirmishes before & since.  General Washington's Army is movd down near German Town. When his Reinforcements are arrived he will endeavour to repair his past misfortunes & I sincerely hope I maybe able to send you some more agreable Intelligence than At present in my power.  General St Clair is neither tried nor Arraigned. How can it be expected in the critical situation of our Affairs: & when his Hearing is to be preceeded by the Report of a Committee who are to collect materials from A Variety of distant Sources for the purpose? With respect to yourself I think you have determined wisely: I advise you however to write a civil Letter to Congress requesting them to give you a Copy of your Charge and assign a day for the Hearing, hinting that a delay in your painful Situation is a Severity which you neither merit from your Country, nor have any Reason to expect from Congress.(1) Give my Compls to Maj.

  Dear Sir, York Town Octr 5th. 1777 I will not omit sending you a few Lines by so good an Opportunity as the present, though I am but poorly fitted with any agreable Subject in this Part of the Continent. In Truth, if you would give Bourgoin a little Leisure to exercise his Talents at Farce Writing which he discovered in the Boston Blockade, he would furnish the World with a Winter Evenings Entertainment at the Expence of Congress at least if not of Congress & General Washington. The Flight to Baltimore was a Trifle compared with the present Jaunt & Situation. We have put our selves under the Commissary & Quarter Masters General for Subsistence. I wish this was the worst of Things in this Quarter. For my own Share I expect to hear day after some new advantage gained by the Enemy. They will shortly have the River wholly at Command having taken the Delaware Frigate with wch. they may get Possession of the other two if they are not burnt. Burlington, Bristol &c &c will feel the Smart of the plundering War which the Enemy may easily carry on by their Water Craft. This is an exceedingly disagreable Posture of Affairs to what we had a Title to expect from Appearances one month ago. Your Army & the eastern Militia are now strongly contrasted with those in the middle State even by the Inhabitants of Philadelphia. It is said Howe would not have passed more than 70 Miles from the Ships which landed him, in his whole Skin in yr. neighbourhood, or among Yankee Stone-walls. I make great Allowance for his having been conducted by Galloway through the most toryfied Part of Pensylvania.(1) Our springs all from the Northward, and almost all our Confidence.  The Congress left Philada. the l9th at 2 oClock A.M. I returned from Bristol to the Capital to dine, and tarried till the 25th; when the Enemy being within a mile & without any opposing Troops in the City, I Slipt into the Jersies. It was lucky that I had a young Lady to gallant thither; for 3 or 4 Officers who left Philada. before me were taken on the Franckfort Road.  I am greatly surprized at one anecdote relative to an Officer in yr. Department whose Sober Services would promote your Glory as well as his own: But whose Indiscretion may do you [Hurt?] while assuredly it will ruin his own Fame.  By the Winter the middle Army will be divided into Greanites & Mifflineans, if Things do not take a great Turn from their present OCTOBER 5, 1777  Situation. Poor Put will be Stripped of his Army, and then be damned for not doing Something while Howe is in Philada. Verily our Salvation must come from afar. Upon the present ill Aspect, some People in Congress Seem to intend to reform their mode of doing or rather not-doing Business, and I believe we shall be able to get speedily thro' the Articles of Confederation, and shall sit faithfully about the Means of keeping our Currency in some sort of Credit. I know nothing radical for this purpose but Taxation, high & payable at short Periods. Every Thing else is only a Palliative.  I wish for the Sake of a most deserving Woman & lovely young Children, you could contrive to do something for one of my old Jail Mates, now a Lieutenant in yr. Army-Richard Carpenter. He is bold as a Lion in our Cause; but I have only my Wife's Assertion that he is intirely altered from what he appeared in the days of his Confinement, when non procul atrita pendebat Cantharus ansa.(2) His Orthography is by no means his greatest Recommendation, as you will See by the inclosed. I have given you the only two unfavourable Hints I knew respecting him. If he proves my Wife's account true he is worthy of yr Notice, and I will own myself his Friend. The Gentleman who delivers this has received an Advantage from yr Recommendation, but as there was an old Resolution upon the Journals that \""Congress would take an early opportunity to promote Majr. Livingston,\"" which was not recollected, when a motion in his favour was made upon his coming to tell from Genl. Schyler what Genl. Lincoln had written about Brigadr. Stark's Fighting, this Opportunity when Mr. Throop came properly from a Battle was taken to bring into Effect the mentioned Record. Thus both the Young Gentlemen are promoted. I hope Stark will not make the same Puzzle as another Officer has made about the Date of his new Rank,(3) For I think it impossible that in one Case or the Other Congress should antedate without the greatest Confusion. One Case had been absolutely determined before any Knowledge of the Anecdote which I have before hinted at, which would have fixed me if I had not been fixed before. I fear that Sprightly Gentlemen will be duped, by an artful Senior now disgraced, so as to become a Tool for base Purposes. I will do my best that neither one or the other shall detract from your Reputation here, if they should basely attempt it. You ought not to suffer yourself to be embarrased there a moment after Discovery of plain Intention in any man to do it.  We have no Prints in this Place or I would forward them. I hope one or two late alterations with the Power of filling Places will make the Commissary and Quartermasters Departments of some better use to you than they have been lately.  I will not urge you to be particular to me till you have more Leisure than you had when Mr. Throop left you, but be assured that  I am, Sir, Your Friend & Most humb Servt. James Lovell  ""

  Sir, York Town. October 5th. 1777. Sunday Morning Your Favour of the 2d September I this minute received and am glad to hear that the money, tho' very late has arrived.(1) The Congress left Philadelphia about the 20th and are now at this place doing business. Our military affairs have taken an unexpected turn, Genl Howe is in possession of Philadelphia, without a second battle, this in some measure has been owing to very great rains that happened on the instant of the armies engaging, as our Soldiers are without Tents, the baggage having been sent some distance Their Guns and Powder were so wet that Genl Washington was obliged to retire some distance to refit, and get other Powder &c. I understand that Genl Howe has not suffered his Troops to march into the City, and has done little violence as yet to any of the Inhabitants.  Genl. Washington's Army is greatly reinforced by the militia from Virginia, and the Jersies, so that I expect it will not be long before he attacks the Enemy. I am not able to give you an account whether the Enemy or we are in possession of the Delaware, not having heard for several days.  Genl Burgoyne and his army are in a situation very critical, He having lately met with a repulse in an attack on Genl Gates who has upwards of 9000 men with him and 6 or 7000 behind Burgoyne under the command of Genl Lincoln. We have taken the greater part of the Enemy's water craft, and are in possession of the lines near Ticonderoga, so that we expect that Fort is in our possession again, as it was besieged more than ten days ago. It is said Burgoyne has not more than 6 or 7000 soldiers with him. The Indians have all declared on our side, and of course left him. Should we be able to destroy that army Genl Howe must retire to New York, or run a very great risk of suffering that place to fall into our hands, as he cannot keep that and Philadelphia without the assistance of Burgoyne. OCTOBER 5, 1777  The Inhabitants of this State are much divided in their sentiments. They are all Tories, the way that Genl Howe marched, they wish him success but have not courage to join his army.  I was lately at Camp, where your son was well. I am in hopes soon to be able to give you a more pleasing account of our affairs here. I shall apply to Congress to give some directions relative to the Pork you mentioned, to morrow.(2) I am with due respect, Sir, your Obt servt, J. Penn  ""

  (In Committee for foreign Affairs) Honorable Gentlemen. York Town Pensylvania Octr. 6th 1777  Since ours to you by return of the Packet from New Hamshire and duplicates by Mr. McCreary from Maryland, we have not written, nor have we received any of your favors during the last two months, except a letter of old date (Apr. 29th) signed by Mr. Deane & Doctr. Lee.(1) Capt. Hammond being not yet arrived, altho he sailed in April, makes it too probable that he has either fallen into the hands of the enemy or miscarried at sea. Two reasons have prevented us from writing hitherto-because from your assurances we had room to expect a monthly packet, and because the progressive state of the war gave us reason to look daily for some more decisive event than had happened, and which might warrant the expence of a particular packet, as the usual conveyance by merchant vessels is almost intirely stopt by the number & vigilance of the British cruisers.  We shall now give you an accurate detail of the war in the northern & middle departments where alone it has raged since our last. You were before apprized of the evacuation of Tyconderoga and of the retreat of our army from thence towards Albany. Genl. Bourgoin was rapid in pursuit of his successes, and pressed quickly on as far as Fort Edward upon Hudsons' River about 20 miles above Albany. Here his progress was interrupted by the American army which halted & was reenforced a little below him. This circumstance with the following events have continued that interruption, and bid fair to render abortive at least the great advantages expected by our  OCTOBER 6, 1777  Enemies from their first successes on the Lakes. The better to effect his purpose, Genl. Bourgoine had detached General St. Leiger, with a body of regular troops, Canadians and Indians, by the Oneida Lake & Wood Creek to take fort Schuyler, (formerly Stanwix) and to make an impression along the Mohawk river. This part of the plan has been totally defeated by the Bravery of Genl. Harkimer with the Tryon County militia, and by the gallant defence of Fort Schuyler by Coll. Gansevort & Lt. Coll. Willet. The former of these met the Enemy in the field, defeated them, and killed a great number of their Indian Allies. This defeat being obtained by militia, they dispersed as usual, and left the enemy to collect & lay seige to Fort Schuyler; which was defended with great gallantry by the two Officers above mentioned, untill the approach of Genl. Arnold with a body of troops occasioned the enemy to raise the seige of that fortress, & retreat with great precipitation, leaving their baggage, ammunition, provisions & some artillery, wch. fell into our hands. Another body of troops was detached by Genl. Bourgoine under command of Lt. Coll. Baum to the Eastward, for the purpose of collecting horses to mount the Troopers, provisions & Teams for the use of the army. This detachment was met, attacked & defeated by the brave Genl. Stark and the New Hampshire Militia at a place called Bennington, and now rendered famous by the total overthrow of 1500 regular troops (posted behind works & fortified with cannon) by 2000 militia. The two wings of Mr. Bourgoin being thus cut off his body remained inactive until the 19th of last month when he moved on to attack Genl. Gates who commands the northern Army and was well posted at the Heights above Behmus's. The Consequence of this attack you will see related by Genl Gates himself among the inclosures, as well as the account of our successes in the rear of the enemy on the Lakes George & Champlain by Col. Brown who had been detached for the purpose by Genl. Lincoln, who is also in Genl. Bourgoin's Rear with a strong body of troops. Thus surrounded on all sides, with little prospect of safe retreat, and a strong army in front growing stronger every day by reenforcemts. we hope e'er long to be able to give you information of definitive success over the British army in that quarter. An aid of Genl. Gates who brought these last accounts tells us that, by the concurring testimony of prisoners, deserters, & our own people who have escaped from the enemy their loss could not be less than 1000 or 1200 Men, in killed, wounded & missing, and that Genl. Bourgoine himself was wounded in the shoulder by a rifle-ball.  In the middle department the war has been less favorable to us, as you will see by what follows. About the middle of Augst. the British Fleet appeared in Cheseapeak Bay and landed Genl. Howe's army at the head of Elke, about 50 miles from Philadelphia. Genl. Washington's army, which had crossed the Delaware on the embarkation of the British army and the appearance of the Fleet off the capes of that  river, now proceeded to meet the enemy, and came up with. them near Wilmington. After various skirmishes & maneouvres, a general engagement took place at Chad's Ford over the Brandywine on the 11th of Septr last. This battle terminated in leaving the enemy in possession of the field with nine peices of our artillery. Our loss in killed, wounded & missing did not exceed 600. That of the enemy, as far as we have been able to get information was near 2000. An orderly book taken from them since the battle makes it 1900. Genl. Washington retreated across the Schuylkill, and, having refreshed his army, recrossed that river in two days after the former battle, with design to attack the enemy, who had remained close by the field of action until he came up wth. them again. To be the better prepared for battle, and to be guarded against the consequences of a defeat, our army marched without baggage and left their Tents behind. In this situation, and just in the moment of beginning an attack upon the enemy, a heavy long-continued & cold rain with high wind came on, and prevented it. The ammunition in the cartridge boxes was all rendered unfit for use, the arms injured, and the troops a good deal hurt & dispirited. In this situation of things it became necessary to retire from before the enemy to a place of safety, in order to clean the arms, replace the cartridges and refresh the men. The enemy were also without Tents, but they have good blankets, are better cloathed than our men, and have tin receptacles to keep dry their cartridges. Genl. Howe, judging of our situation, put his army in motion, and endeavoured to harrass & distress us by marches, counter marches and frequent shews of designing to give battle. After a Variety of manoeuvres, the enemy crossed Schuylkill below our army, and, marching to Philadelphia, have possessed themselves of that city. Genl. Washington, having refreshed & rested his troops, and being reenforced, is now moving towards the enemy. This unfortunate rain has injured our affairs considerably by having thrown a number of our men into hospitals, and by the distress and harrassment of our army consequent thereon. However, they are recovering again and we hope e'er long to give Genl Howe reason to repent his possession of Philadelphia. The real Injury to America from the Loss of that City is not so great as some are apt at first view to imagine, unless the reports and misconceptions of this matter in Europe should too much dispirit our friends and inspirit our enemies. But we rely on your careful & just representation of it to prevent the ill impressions it may otherwise make.  When this contest first began we foresaw the probability of losing our great towns on the water, and so expressly told our enemies in the address of the first Congress but we are blessed with an extensive Seacoast by which we can convey & receive benefits independent of any particular Spot. And it is very far from being clear to us that the enemy will be able to hold Philadelphia, as we are yet masters of the   Delaware below, and have hopes of keeping it, so as to prevent the British fleet from getting up to the City. Should this be the case Genl. Howe's visit cannot be of long duration.  You say that \""the vessels of the United States will be received at the Havannah as those of France, the most favored nation.\""(2)We wish to be exactly informed whether north American products may be carried thither, or Prizes taken to, & disposed of in that port, or any other port of his catholic Majesty in America. You likewise mention a late Draught of the Mississippi taken for the Government of Gr. Britain. We are desirous of being furnished with a copy. It is with pleasure we read your assurance of sending the soldiers cloathing and other materials for the army, in time to meet the approaching cold season. They will be greatly wanted. As the degree of success the enemy have met with this year will probably support the hopes of a vindictive court, and occasion the straining of every Nerve for the accomplishment of its tyrannic views, we doubt not your most strenuous exertions to prevent Gr. Britain from obtaining Russian or German Auxiliaries for the next campaign; And we think with you that it is an object of great importance to cultivate & secure the friendship of his Prussian Majesty, as well for the preventing this evil, as for obtaining his public recognition of our Independence, and leave of his ports for the purposes of commerce & disposal of Prizes. The original Papers which you mention in a triplicate to have sent, never came to hand; so that we can only make conjectures as to the disposition of that Monarch .(3)  The marine force of the enemy is so considerable, in these seas, & so over proportionate to our infant navy, that it seems quite necessary and wise to send our ships to distress the commerce of our enemies in other parts of the world. For this purpose, the marine committee have already ordered some vessels to France under your directions as to their future operation, and we expect more will be sent.(4) But our Frigates are not capable of carrying much bulky commodity for commercial purposes, without unfitting them for war, besides the consideration of our being obliged to get them away how & when we can or endanger their being taken, which prevents our sending them to those Staple Colonies where the commodities wanted are to be obtained. The reciprocal benefits of Commerce cannot flow from or to N. America until some maritime power in Europe will aid our cause with marine strength; and this circumstance gives us pain, least it should be considered on our part as unwillingness to pay our debts, when the truth is that we have the greatest desire of doing so, have materials in abundance, but not the power of conveying them. This leads us to reflect on the great advantages that must unavoidably accrue to all parties if France & Spain were to afford effectual aid on the Sea, by loan or sale of Ships of war, according to the former propositions of Congress; or, if the Farmers General could be prevailed  on to receive in America the Tobacco or other products of this northern continent which France may want.  We are, Gentlemen, Your most humb. Servts,  Benja Harrison Richard Henry Lee Robt Morris Thos Heyward Junr.  Jno Witherspoon James Lovell P.S. Octr. 9th.

  (In Committee for foreign Affairs) Honorable Gentlemen York Town, Pensylvania, Octr. 6th. 1777.  We shall follow yr. example in confining this letter entirely to yours of May 26th (1) respecting the Loan and mode of raising it by appropriation of vacant lands. It remains doubtful yet whether there is any vacant land not included within some one of the thirteen states: And it is an undetermined question of great magnitude whether such land is to be considered as common stock or the exclusive property of the state within whose charter bounds it may be found. Until this business shall have been determined in Congress and approved by the states, you will readily discover the difficulty of doing any thing in the way of raising money by appropriation of vacant land. We consider your proposal on this subject as of very great importance, and we shall not fail to solicit the attention of Congress thereto whenever the pressing business of the campaign will permit.(2) In the mean time, we see no reason that should prevent the young Nobleman of Irish ex- OCTOBER 6, 1777  tract from coming to America; because the suspension of the question concerning vacant lands will not obstruct his views of getting the quantity he may want, either by original entry, or by purchase on the most reasonable terms upon the frontiers of those states where vacant lands are in abundance to be met with.  We are warranted to say that such rank as that Nobleman may have when he leaves service in Europe will be granted to him here.  Congress clearly discern with you the all important concern of supporting the credit of our continental money, and, with this view, have proposed, as you will see by the inclosed resolve to pay the interest of twenty millions of dollars by bills drawn on you. This we hope will in time replenish the Loan Offices so effectually, as, with the aid of taxation now generally taking place, to prevent the necessity of future emissions.(3)  By your letter of the 25th of May we have no doubt but that those bills will be paid with all due punctuality.(4) About 5 millions only of the twenty voted are yet borrowed, and the interest on these 5 will not to be drawn for in bills of exchange till near a twelve month.  We are, Gentlemen, Your humble Servants.  Benja Harrison Richard Henry Lee Robt Morris James Lovell Jno Witherspoon Thos. Heyward Junr.  ""

  My dear sir, York Town in Pennsylva. 6th Octr 1777 I am favoured with yours of Sepr. 15th (1) & suppose that eer this will reach You the Orders of the Commercial Committee,(2) for the Disposal of the several Cargoes consigned to You by Messers Gardoquis, will be received. The Anchors & Cordage will of Course be delivered to your navy Board; & with respect to the Duck, Medicines, & Salt, I OCTOBER 6, 1777  think it will be the surest Way, to deliver to the Board what is immediately wanted of each, & inform Congress thereof, together with the Necessity that led to this Measure. My Reason for this proposal is that the Disposition already made of these Cargoes, will require a Reconsideration, wsh Committees as well as Congress are generally averse to: whereas, there will be no Difficulty in approving your Conduct, when evidently founded on the Necessity of the Case. The Blankets, I fear, cannot be spared from the army. A timely application to the marine Board for such other Articles as may be wanted, which should be particularly enumerated, will produce the Order which You desire.  Since my last, some of the Important Events that have taken place, prove, that those of war are very uncertain. From Circumstances whether favourable or unfortunate, We are apt to expect similar Consequences; & the reverse frequently happens; from whence We may learn, in Times of prosperity, Caution, & of Adversity, perseverance & a firm Resolution not to despond. The Loss of Philadelphia, which In the End I think will be a salutary Event, is owing under providence to several Causes. The Misbehaviour of the Militia of Pennsylvania is one, & is attributed to the Militia Act, which invests the people with the power of appointing the regimental officers. Be the Cause what it may, nothing could equal their Timidity; As I am informed by some of the principal Inhabitants of the State that twenty five Hessians put to Flight two Regiments at the Battle of the Brandywine, & that when the General ordered them to supply the place of a Brigade, which he had ordered from Chads Ford to reinforce General Sullivan at Jones Ford, they refused to comply with his orders from apprehensions of Danger, & by those means put the Enemy in Possession of our Lines, wch they would not have attempted to attack, had they been properly manned. Another Cause is said to have been the Circumstance of the Country thro which the Enemy marched to the City, it being inhabited by Tories, who gave the best of Intelligence to the Enemy, & deceived General Washington. These are undoubted Facts, & by the best Information that I can get, there is not such a Collection of disaffected people on the Continent, as of the quakers inhabiting that part of Pennsylvania. The Disputes about the Constitution of this State, have produced such a Division & Torpor thro out the same, as renders it at present an inactive, lifeless, unwieldy, Mass. Thus much for this State; & the Militia of Maryland & Delaware are but little better, but the principal Cause of their obtaining the City without a second Battle, which at the Time of my writing my last Letter was hourly expected, was a heavy rain that happened on the Day of the Meeting of the Armies, & after their advanced parties were engaged; this obliged them to retire, & the Baggage of our Army was so far distant, that the Tents could not be procured; by which Means all the Ammunition of the Soldiers was   destroyed, their Arms hurt, & the Army so injured, that they were under the Necessity of marching the next Day twenty Miles into the Country to avoid a Battle; which must have been fought on our Side by Bayonets & Artillery only. But I am apprehensive, that the Vanity of the southern States, which has produced such Instances of Invective against the eastern officers & Troops whenever they have misbehaved, stimulated them to oppose General Howe with as little Assistance as possible from the eastern States, that they might have had the Opportunity of boasting how much the united States owed their Liberties to the southern, who opposed themselves to the main Army of the Enemy. This I am led to beleive, from the Declarations that were made previous to the Battle of the Brandywine, & likewise from the Neglect to draw off more Troops from Peeks Kill when the Enemy landed at Elk; but since the late Occurrences, Reason seems to have taken place, the eastern officers & Troops are highly spoken of, the others indifferently by their own People, & I hope that each will be convinced, that a party Spirit is not Only unprofitable but destructive to both. Generals Washington & Mifflin are however ever averse to such a Spirit.  We have heard from the northern Army & I congratulate You on the Success of Colo Brown, & the good Conduct of our Troops in the Action of the l9th Sepr; We are in daily Expectation of some decisive Action in that Quarter, which may be very important.  By a Letter from General Putnam of the 29th Sepr. he supposed that a Reinforcement of three thousand Men had arrived at New York & that more were expected; if so, we must increase our Exertions to meet the most vigorous Efforts & perhaps the last that our Enemies can make. He recd his Information from one of our field officers which he has lately exchanged, but I strongly suspect & hope that it will turn out to be a Feint, & that the Transports were sent from the Enemy's Fleet, when they arrived at the Capes of Virginia, for this purpose. A Fleet consisting of sixty Sail was seen the 25th of August in the Latitude of the Capes, standing with the Wind at S S E to the Eastward, & is probably the same that arrived at New York, but You will undoubtedly be able to ascertain the Fact, by the Time this reaches You.  General Washington on the Morning of the 4th Instant about 1/2 past 5 surprized the Enemy's Camp at German Town; the particulars We have not yet recd or a Line from the General; but a Mr McClure who is a reputable Citizen of Baltimore, & as a Volunteer was in both the Actions of Prince Town & the Brandywine, & also in this, declares that it by far exceeds the others. By his Account our army advanced in three Divisions, the left of which did not come up for Reasons unknown, the other two attacked the Enemy, drove them thro German Town to their Lines, & attacked them therein for a considerable Time, untill the General ordered them to retreat. The  Carnage he says was great, & particularly on the side of the Enemy; General Nash is wounded, & General Sullivans Brigade Majors are said to be mortally wounded. I suppose his aid de Camps are intended, the wounded were brot off, & a Field peice of the Enemy's. Our Troops behaved with great Bravery. This is confirmed by a Letter wch General Mifflin, who is sick at Redding recd from an officer in his Department & forwarded to Congress. You will soon have more authentic accounts & I hope they will be agreable from this as well as other quarters.  General Howe has issued a proclamation confirming his promises of protection & pardon to such of the Inhabitants of the middle States as remained in their Homes & returned to their Allegiance in Consequence of his proclamation when he landed at Elk, & as shall continue to merit it by their future Behavior & excluded all other persons whatever from the Benefit thereof; this shews what the Consequences of a Conquest Would be, more than Volumes could do on the Subject.(3) With the heartiest Wishes for your Health & Happiness I remain sir yours very sincerely, E Gerry  [P.S.] One of the Continental Ships in the Delaware was brot against the City, & by some Means unknown to us at present, has fallen into the Hands of the Enemy. A 20 Gun Ship, [10?] Gun Brig & 700 hhds Rum with abt 200 of Sugar was taken by Capt Biddle in the Randolph at So Carolina.  8th. Inclosed is a Copy of a Letter from General Washington containg an authentic Account of the action of the 4th.(4) I must beg the Favour of your requesting the Hona Assembly to send a Member to supply my place in Congress abt the 1st of December, as my Health requires some relaxation from Business.

The attention of thinking Men is now to the next Step of General Washington. A few days longer delay to dispossess General Howe of Philadelphia & greatly reduce the British Army will lay a foundation for continuing the Campaign through the Winter at a very great expense & hazard to us. The Enemy will be Master of much the greatest part of this & the State of Delaware & too probably have a clear road through Jersey to New York. The War will in that event be protracted.  Events of War are uncertain & desperate, Men 'though few in number have performed wonders. Mr. Burgoyne is hemmed in on every Side, 'tis possible himself & his whole army I mean the Survivors may find it necessary to surrender themselves prisoners. 'Tis possible & in all appearance barely possible to cut their way through to New York. To escape by way of the Lakes seems now to be impracticable as we have destroyed the principal part & have possession of the remainder of their Navigation. Admitting the destruction of his Army we shall have some thousands of Men to employ in the Winter or early in the Spring before reinforcements can arrive from Britain against New York & the Cantonments of General Howe's Army.  Upon the whole the blunder of General Sullivan in the battle of OCTOBER 6, 1777  Brandywine & the unpardonable negligence of General Wayne have reduced the American States to the present dilemma.(2) If the former had been as Wise as he is allowed to be brave the latter would not have been disgraced by a Surprize when he ought to have been upon his Arms nor should we have heard any more of General Howe but his hurrying fragments of Regiments & Men on board his fleet.

  Dr Papa, 8th October 1777. York The inclosed copy of General Washington's letter to Col. Harrison (1) will give you Some insight into the event of the battle & causes of our miscarriage on Saturday last. It is evident that our men do not want resolution, but they want discipline, if they could have been rallied after the repulse from Chew's house & had renewed the attack when the fog cleared away, it is more than probable that the Enemy rather than risk another onset would have retreated to Chester. Soldiers can not be formed on a sudden, but were our officers better, they might be sooner formed. I am apprehensive the want of money, I mean of good money, will subject us to great difficulties & Such I fear as we shall find almost insurmountable. General Washington is now at Perkiomin 28 miles distant from Pha. Howe is at Chesnut Hill 9 miles from Pha. We this day recd. letters from Albany dated 29th Septr., all things there in Statu quo, except that Lincoln has joined Gates, OCTOBER 8, 1777  whose army is said to be 12000 strong, & Burgoyne 5 or 6 thousand. Gates I think should risk a battle or his militia tired of inaction & delay will soon return home. I am Sorry to inform you that there is misunderstanding between Gates & Arnold, which may possibly prejudice our affairs in that quarter; who is to blame I will not undertake to determine. I wrote you this morning & to Molly (2) & I believe acknowledge the receipt of yours & her letters of the 29th Septr.  The inclosed account brought by Major Clark it is said may be relied on: if it be true the Enemy must have Suffered considerably. The consternation was great in Pha. & the Tories were preparing for flight. We are on the Confederation: yesterday we determined the manner of voting: each State to have a vote: carried by ten States, N. Carolina divided: Virga. against it. Delaware not represented. Tomorrow we take up the rule for ascertaining the quotas of the Debt; when that question is determined we shall take up the affair of boundaries & back lands.  Gen. Nash is a loss, in my opinion he would have made an excellent officer in time; he was brave, modest, sensible, attentive, & good tempered.  By comparing several letters giving an account of the late action I find they all attribute the miscarriage to the Stand the Enemy made at Chew's house, which we wanted cannon to force, & to the fog, which made our enemy mistake some of their own parties for the Enemy.  When the Confederation is finished I hope Congress & the several States will take into their immediate consideration the recruiting our army, taxing, to bring monies into our treasuries, & supplying our soldiers with necessaries. We must draft from the militia to fill up our regular battalions, no other way I believe will be found to fill them, & to make this more palatable to the People all militia men must stand the draft.  I am in hopes that General Washington will again attempt something agt. the enemy, as he has recd. since the action a reinforcement of upwards of 1000 Virginians, but these are chiefly militia: unless the Enemy can recruit their army in Pha. they must be very weak in a short time, if frequently attacked.

On every side the Enemy gave way: But a heavy Fog which totally obstructed all Communication Among our different divisions; and indeed destroyd all distinction between Friends and Foes; seemingly in the midst of Conquest, put an End to all these sanguine Expectations by a sudden Retreat of our Troops. This it is supposed was occasion'd by the Left Wing of our Army's coming up & endeavouring to Join the other body; and each mistaking the other for a fresh Reinforcement of the Enemy. The Enemy however did not pursue, but permitted General Washington to retire with his Cannon, and wounded, at Leisure; venturing only, after some Cessation, to fire a few long shot from some pieces of Cannon. This is the Substance of General Washington's Letter receivd this moment in Congress where I write this short Account; not having it in my power to give you a Copy of his dispatches at large.  The Loss on either side is not ascertaind. The Consequence the General infers from the Engagement is, that it will make his Troops familiar with danger, and more ready to attack as well as more determind and hardy in Action. In other Respects he observes that his situation is Just the same, as before the Battle, the Loss of men excepted, which is supposed to be fully compensated by the great Havock made among the Enemy.  When further Circumstances come to Light your Excellency shall be furnished with particulars. Tho' this last Battle cannot be called a fortunate Event it gives no discouragement. The State of Pensylvania however remains weak, feeble and inactive, & contributes little to the common Defence. The dissention concerning their frame of Government seems to have shaken all publick Virtue to the foundation. This between ourselves.  I have nothing to add, but to assure you that with great Respect, I am, Sir, your Excellency's most obedient huml Serv,  Jas. Duane ""

  Dear Sir York Town Octobr 8th 1777 I wrote you a few days since from this place by Storer Your Express, since which Another Genll Action has happened between Genll Washington & the British Troops in this Quarter, the main body of which were posted about 2 miles this side German Town. Genll Washington finding Genll How had sent out a strong party to Attack Billingsport below Philadelphia & had left himself as Weak as he could expect to find him according made his disposition to Attack the Enemy early on Saturday Morning last in three Columns. Genll Sullivan to Command the right, Genll Conway to March in his front & before they reached the Enemy to file off to Attack them in their flank. Genll Armstrong with the Pensilvania Militia who marched with Genll Green was to have taken a small Circuit & come on upon the rear of the Enemies right. I forget who Commanded the Centre division, but Glls Wain & Maxwell were a body of reserve. It happened to be a very foggy morning & no wind. The Enemies Picket was Attackd a little before sun rise drove at once on upon the first part of their main Army which were their light Infantry, who soon gave way & Indeed their whole Army & were Successfully drove about two miles & for the space of more than 2 hours tho we were greatly embarrassed by the fog & thickness of the weather which with the smoke of the Cannon so darkned the air that the Enemy could not be distinguished nor our different persons see the Opperations of each other & sometimes taking friends for foes which was most unhappily the case in Genll Greens Division who fired on each other & threw each other into the great[est] Confusion avoiding each Other which Confusion catched from Column to Column. A Confused retreat took place & to rally them was Impossible tho our troops before had behaved with the greatest spirit & bravery, and a most Compleat Victory seemed full in prospect. Till this Unfortunate mistake occasioned by the fog Snatched it out of our hands the prospect was full, of our Army in a very few hours again entering Philadelphia but once more disappointed. The enemy were so wounded & disheartened as not to follow our retreat but only with a few long Shot but [their] Camp was again regained which was for sometime in our possession. We lost Nothing but carried off all our Stores & wounded. The seriousness of the mistake not at all dispirited (as the Genll writes) but eager again to renew the Attack. The Virginias & Others on the road had not arrived time enough to be in this Action but no doubt by this time have joined the Army which will much more we hope then make up our loss tho the Genll has not given us the Number yet says it is not very considerable. The Enemy they think must have suffered much, but at present have no returns. We expect Another Attack will soon be made on the Enemy. Hope we shall soon learn to beat OCTOBER 8, 1777  them. And after a few more severe Conflicts the Almighty may give us a Compleat Conquest over our Enemy in every Quarter. I forgot to Mention that Genll McDougall was in Greens division. Whether Coll Thos has joined his Regiment I know not as I cannot hear one word from him since you wrote me he had left home. My most sincere affection to Wife & family & regards to friends. Should be glad to hear from you as often as possible & to know our New Election of Delegates as soon as it happens. Mr. Redick is pursuing your affair and is delivering over Stores &c with all dilligence and Attention but meets with mony dificulties.(1)Great Waste & imbezlements believe have happened in this quarter. He has often wrote to Mr. Irwin & others Concerned to know what was purchased here & for receipts &c but says he can receive no Answer. The New Commiss. Insist on weight & measure in every thing. Much Wheat & flower is greatly damaged. I fear you may suffer much in this Country & Whether you will not be Obliged to come into this quarter your self to save much loss you will soon be able to Judgue. I find to my surprise that the Commissrs. for setling Accounts are ordered from Hartford to this Country. It is moved to be taken up again as the Inconveniencies you mention beside the danger in removing Your papers at so great a distance is readily seen by every one.

  My Dear Dolly York Town October 8th. 1777 I wrote you two long Letters of the 3d Inst.(1) which hope will reach you. On Saturday last General Washington attack'd General Howes Army near German Town, they were surprised & fled, & our Army pursued them, but a very thick Fog coming up, & by some other Accidents our Army was prevented entering into Philada. that day; General Howe it is said had given orders to the whole of his Troops to Retire to Chester; Our Troops are in high Spirits, & wishing for another Attack, I hope soon to be able to Send you agreeable Accotts.  OCTOBER 8, 1777  I have this moment Rec'd an Express from General Washington, he only mentions the Action in General, not having been able to Collect particulars; as soon as I hear further you shall know, by the Reports there has been a great Slaughter on both Sides. Genl Washington writes that General Sullivan behaved most gallantly & has acquir'd great honour. This the General mentions from his own observation, as he was under his Eye the whole time. One or two Battles more will entirely Ruin Mr Howe's Army. The Waggons that went with you are Return'd, I have not seen any of the Men, I have Sent Dodd after George for the Pickles, hope to get them. Harry the Coachman went directly to the Enemy in Philada. & has Carried in Mr Tailor's money & Smith's the Express. A Number of Persons who staid in Philada. have been put in prison, among others Parson Duche, but we hear he has since been enlarged upon his Parole, we are told there are upwards of Five hundred Whigs in the Philada.Goal. I inclose you one of Genl Howe's Proclamations. When you have perus'd it Send it to Mr Bant & let him know the Contents of this as far as it Respects News, as I have not time to write him, in short I am so hurried & Engag'd that I have no time left for Relaxation. We have adopted a new mode of meeting in Congress, we begin at 10 oClock, set till one, then adjourn to 4 oClock, then meet again; but I dislike it, as we continue to Sit in the Eveng. I sat in the Chair yesterday & Conducted the Business Eight hours, which is too much, & after that had the Business of my office to attend to as usual. I cannot Stand it much longer in this way. I have been very unwell since you left me, but Thank God, I am much better, my appetite is return'd, & I do tolerably well. I am exceedingly happy in my Lodgings, I have the best in the place, & the Lady of the House very Agreeable, which makes my Scituation pleasant, she is vastly Obliging, & I am in hopes I shall prevail on her to Consent that I shall Dine at her Table (for I now only Breakfast with her) which will be more agreeable than dining every day at the Tavern. Mrs. Swoope (the Name of the Lady with whom I am) is earnest I should Send for you here, she very politely offer'd every Service in her power, & will Accommodate you in the best manner, I Tell her if I should be oblig'd to Spend the winter here, I shall certainly Send for you, but of that I cannot with certainty Judge; this is a pleasant Town, & if I had you with me, I should be very easy & happy but my Intention is for Boston as soon as the Campaign is over; however don't build upon this, for I may still be obliged to Send to desire you to Return. I have not heard a word from you, nor had a Line since the one by Dodd, except Mr Bant's Letter, which came to hand two days ago. I beg, My Dear, you will write me by all Oppors., you cannot plead the want of paper &c, as has been the case. I shall now establish this Rule in future with respect to my writing, Vizt. you may depend on having a Letter from me for every one of yours.

  Dear Sir York 8th October 1777. Two days ago I dispatched a few lines to you by the hand of Sir Patrick Houston, probably this which is intended by Muckinfuss may reach you first, by him I also send an old packet to Govr. Rutledge in which I beleive is one of the 18th September inclosed for you. I found it at this place in possession of certain very tardy Travellers. I mean now to trouble you with a rather long epistle but from an OCTOBER 8, 1777  assurance of being twenty times at least interrupted in my progress I will not promise regularity. I shall go back to that 18th September & recapitulate as many circumstances in public affairs Since that time as occurs to memory.  The Evening of that day I went as far as Frankfort in order to see into the arrangement of my baggage & to Shift my apparel Suitable to the change of weather & had engaged to breakfast with an old freind at 1/2 past 8 next Morning in Philadelphia. About 4 oClock next Morning I was knocked up by Sir Patrick Houston who informed me that advice had been received of General Howes crossing Schuylkill at 11 oClock & that part of his Army would be in the City before Sunrise. I could feel no impression, I judged differently from the City people who I had always expected would fall a prey to their fears, I considered the difficulty of crossing a ford with an Army of 6 or 7 Thousand Men, Cannon, Horses, Waggons, Catle &ca &ca, the right disposition of the whole & detaching a respectable force to a distance of 22 Miles. While my Carriage & Waggon were preparing to go forward the Scene was equally droll & melancholy. Thousands of all Sorts in all appearances past by in such haste that very few could be prevailed on to answer to the Simple question what News7 I however would not fly, I stayed Breakfast & did not proceed till 8 oClock or past nor would I have gone then but returned once more into the City if I had not been under an engagement to take charge of the Marquis delafayette who lay wounded by a ball through his Leg at Bristol. My bravery however was the effect of assurance for could I have believed the current report, I should have fled as fast as any Man, no Man can possibly have a greater reluctance to an intimacy with Sir William Howe than my Self.  I proceeded to Bristol, the little Town was covered by fugitives, the River by Vessels of War & Store Vessels & others from Philadelphia, the Road choaked by Carriages, Horses & Waggons. The Same was disgustingly Specked by Regimental Coats & Cockades, Volunteer blades I suppose who had blustered in that habit of the mighty feats they would perform if the English should dare to come to Philadelpa. Upon these I looked with deep contempt. From Bristol I had the honour of conducting the Marquis who is possessed of the most excellent funds [of] good sense & inexhaustible patience to Bethlehem where the Second day after our arrival I left him in Bed anxious for nothing but to be again in our Army as he always calls it, & proceeded through Reading to Lancaster, at Reading I learned of General Wayne's false step, a second hindrance to our driving the Invaders out of the Country. That affair & Some others you will find Spoken of in my Sons Letters to me which I shall transmit with this. The moment I had written the preceeding word another Letter from that Gentleman & the most welcome of all I ever received from him was brought into my Chamber. I had before the receipt of this endeavoured to   fortify my mind against the attacks of Ill tidings for as I had heard of death & wounds which had fated other Officers in the Battle of German Town the 3d Inst. & could learn nothing concerning him, it was natural to conclude that an illjudged tenderness had tonguetied all my friends-A Sight of the well known hand on his Letter in a moment dissipated every gloomy apprehension but the Sudden revulsion of joy cost me a few tears which probably would have been so soon started if I had heard of his death. This young Man is a Soldier has done well, the Marquis had informed me on our journey that in the Battle of Brandywine \""it was not his fault that he was not killed or wounded, he did every thing that was necessary to procure one or to'ther.\""  He has in him qualities more valuable than Courage, he understands the Science of War in theory & is getting fast into practical knowledge, he is modest & cool. I know him well. I speak of him not as my Son, but with pleasure as a freind, a Countryman & a Member of So Carolina. In the former Character I feel a resentment against him although I judged it best to express it in the Softest terms to himself, for the Robberies he has committed, he has taken a husband & Father from his young family, a Guardian from his Brother & Sister, a Son & freind from a dependent Father & I still look upon him as standing on the verge of Eternity. To morrow I may again hear of his bravery sealed by his fall. So let it be! If it be God's Will tis mine my duty to bear.(1)  ""

  My dear Sir, York 8th Octr. 1777 I must make one general apology for the matter and manner of my letters-the want of time to discharge with propriety, an hundredth part of the business with which I am crowded. My eyes fail me fast, and I believe my understanding must soon follow this incessant toil. We have had another general engagement with the enemy at and near German Town. With ours, we attacked their Army. The plan was well concerted, and the execution was so bravely conducted, that a most brilliant victory was on the moment of being obtained, when accident alone removed it from us. The morning was so foggy, which with the state of the Air keeping down the Smoke of the Cannon &c effectually prevented our people from knowing their success, occasioned delay, and gave the enemy time to rally and return to the charge which they did five several times. But this was not the worst. Our right & left Columns mistook each other for enemies and appre- OCTOBER 8, 1777  hending a fresh reenforcement gave way too soon to a last effort of the enemy, and quitted a glorious victory absolutely in their power. However, they retired in order, and had so severely handled the enemy that they dared not pursue, and our wounded with every thing valuable was brought off. Our Army is now upon the ground they left before the battle, in the high spirits, and satisfied they can beat the enemy. I hope they will quickly have an opportunity, as the reinforcements from our Country have reached the Army since the engagement. Our loss is pretty well fixed to 700 killed, wounded and missing. That of the enemy not certainly known, but surely very great, as you may judge by the following intelligence brot this evening by Gen. Greens Aid and which he says may be relied on-Gen. Agnew, Colonels Woolcot, Abercrombie & Tho. Byrd (from Virga) with General De Heisters Son killed, Gen. Kniphausen wounded in the hand, and between 2 and 300 waggons loaded with wounded sent into Philadelphia. That Gen. Howe had sent about 2000 Hessians over Schuylkill (denoting a retreat) and that he refused to let any of the Inhabitants of Philadelphia to go to see the field of battle.(1) Gen Schuyler writes us the 29th [i.e. 27th] of September, that if superior numbers, health, and spirits can give success, our army in the Northern department will have it this Campaign. For my part I do not despair of success on this quarter also. Another such battle as the last, will totally unfit Gen Howe for pursuing further hostilities this Campaign and again possess us of Philadelphia.  Suffer me now Sir to recommend to your interest the appointment of the French Artillerists mentioned in our public letter by this express.(2)You may depend upon it that these are Masters of the Art they profess, and are people of character. They are part, and the better part of General Coudrays Corps, who were returning to France upon the death of that General, but prevailed on to remain until our Country could be consulted about employing them. The terms seem high, but the knowledge they possess, and we want, is to us above price. Some Gentlemen from other States have been applying to them, but on inquiry they like the accounts they have received of Virginia better than any other. Now that we have got from under the protection of G. Britain it is indispensably necessary that we understand well the use of Cannon and be strongly provided with them. Capt Loyeaute, whom we propose for Colonel of our Battallion of Artillery is realy a man of science, and not unacquainted with practise, and if he can prevail on the Veteran Sergeants to go with him,(3) we shall gain a competency in that art so necessary, and which we are so unacquainted with.  The inclosed is the Substance of the Account brot by Gen. Greens Aid. Be so good as present my respects to Mr Page, and excuse me for not writing to him as I realy have not time.  I have a very good opinion of Colo. Carrington and would will-  ingly serve him, but I much doubt whether the rasure of the Journal you propose can be obtained, but I will try.(4)  I am very sincerely and affectionately yours,  Richard Henry Lee ""

The Prospect was a good while very promising, but it pleased God to blast it by the intervention of a Fog. With what infinite Ease in the random Course of Providence are the grandest Events influenced & determined, a striking Instance of which is this, & so also the very heavy rain which parted the Armys at the moment of Action, abt the 17th ulto. How strange, that so many disbelieve, or at least totally disregard it. We were not prepared for so great a Salvation as seemd to be opening & almost in possession.  We have reason to think that many of our brave Men are fallen, & a number of principal officers killed & wounded, Among the latter Brigr. Gen. Nash of Maryland,(1) a brave officer, mortally. A Gent. in the Action, says it was much warmer than that of Prince Town or Brandywine in both which he was also present. We cannot say much more for want of Information.  The Enemy have got the Delawar Frigate, & the Forts on the River, & probably are in full possession of the River. Tho these things look against Us, We yet hope in the divine Mercy.

  Dear Father 9th October 1777. York. The inclosed will give you the latest accounts from our army. I write this to give you some further particulars relating to our northern army. Gates & Arnold are not on speaking terms, the latter asserts that the former behaves to him with Such haughtiness that he can  OCTOBER 9, 1777  scarce put up with it, & suspects that Gates is envious of him for the share he had in the late action of the 19th. Burgoyne has strongly intrenched himself in his camp & waits probably for reinforcements from Canada, or for an attack on the high lands by the forces under Clinton at New York. We have reason to believe from a letter we lately recd. from Putnam that Clinton is meditating Such an attack. Putnam is weak but has written for reinforcements which must be drawn from Gate's army, which is said to consist of 13000 men.  Our Assembly will probably meet towards the end of this month or early in the next. I propose to attend the Session, if I am relieved, & I suppose the Assembly will take care to order up some one to keep up the representation.  Col. Lloyd, who was here a day or two informed me of what you mention respecting the negroes going from Poplar Island, but the story was so confused that I hoped it was not true; I expect the particulars of that affair in your next.

Since writing the above I have seen General Green, whose column it seems had also drove the enemy & were about closing with us, when unhappily (for I can no otherwise account for it) each took the other for fresh troops of the enemy & retreated precipitately. The fog & clouds of smoke contributed to this as you could scarce distinguish objects at 50 yards. Things appeared in a very favorable way once, as the column under the command of General Sullivan (who behaved extreamly well) continued to gain ground upon the Enemy till we drove them from Allen's house to Chew's & on their left much lower thro' the encampment of the light Infantry which was abandoned with their baggage &ca. Among other misfortunes that attended us was a hazy atmosphere without a breath of air, so that the smoke of our artillery & small arms often prevented us from Seeing 30 yards & this not for the instant but of long continuance for want of wind to take it off. The causes why the column under Gen. Green & Smallwood did not get up in time I can not now assign, or why Gen. Armstrong, who was to have acted on the Enemy's left, did not push it, I am at present ignorant of. The plan was concerted on very probable grounds of success, & on the execution things looked well a long while as we continued to gain on the Enemy during the whole action, which lasted 2 hours & 40 minutes. My next to Congress will be able to explain matters fully, till then your judgt. must be Suspended. The event turned out contrary to expectation, but we are in no worse condition (except officers & men) than we were.(1)  ""

  My dear General York Town 9th Octobr. 1777 I am now to thank you for your friendly Letter of the 27th tho' with respect to our military operations in the North; on which every thing near and dear to me and mine more immediately depends, your Intelligence is very far from answering the sanguine Expectations which it seems have been too fondly entertaind. Every Eye has been long eagerly turn'd towards Albany for an Express which was to bring the news of the Disappointment and overthrow of General Burgoine -An Event which with the Blessing of Heaven woud draw the most extensive good Consequences (probably it wou'd put it in General Washington's power to terminate the war by Land by a decisive Blow in this Quarter for at present General Howe is not very formidable tho' he has been most fortunate). I need enter into no Comments on any of the Circumstances you relate; I sincerely lament them, I hope all gracious Providence will still direct and conclude Every thing for our Peace & Security.  General Washington on Saturday last bravely attacked General Howe's Army at German Town. Such was the wisdom of the Disposition, & the Ardour of the Troops, that the Enemy cou'd make little Resistance and were actually routed in every Quarter. While Victory seemd ready to be decided in our favour the heavy fog which prevailed deceivd our Right Wing into an Apprehension that the left Wing (which according to the order of Battle was, after dispersing a Body of the Enemy, to Join them, and was accordingly coming up) consisted of a fresh Reinforcement of British Troops. Unhappily the same Opinion was entertain'd of the left wing by the Right: And this mutual Error brought on a precipitate Retreat of both which soon became general. Another incident was very unfortunate. Some British Troops on their flight took possess. of Mr. Chew's large stone House which you may have seen at German Town & mounted a piece of Cannon in the Entry; with which & their small Arms they put a stop to the pursuite of part of our Army after their routed Enemy. To this House the Party occupying it drew Reinforcements which gave their Friends time to Rally, & this probably greatly contributed to turn the Fortune of the day. In the Conclusion our army retreated by a Quick OCTOBER 9, 1777  pace; but not being followd they got into order and carried off their wounded & Cannon. Our Loss is estimated at 700 Killed, wounded & missing: among the first Brigadeer General Nash of North Carolina, by a Common tale a most promising officer! The Enemy's Loss is not ascertain'd; but a Gent. out of Philadelphia affirms the Carnage among them has been dreadful! That 300 Waggon Loads of wounded were carried into the City after the battle. That the dead are so numerous that Genl. Howe would not refer the Inhabitants to see the field of battle; excusing himself that it was a Sight which wou'd shock Humanity. General Agnew, Several Colonels & officers of Rank are also said to be among the Slain. The American Troops pleas'd that they have made the British Grenadiers & Light Infantry run in their Turn, are in high spirits. Indeed all Accounts agree that the attack was made with great Vigour, & pushed with perseverance. General Howe, it is said, has highly commended General Washington for his Intelligence, & his plan of Attack, & the Americans for their Gallantry on this Occasion. It is confidently asserted that he was on the point of withdrawing his flying Troops into Chester at the moment our Army retreated: And that there was the utmost Consternation in Philadelphia; where the American Army was expected and from which the Tories were precipitately retreating. In short if we may believe Reports, nothing further was necessary to accomplish Victory than to have known our own situation and that of the Enemy's; but this the fog prevented. Your Letter, my dear Sir, is referred to a Committee. They will be in no hurry to make out your Charge: and I think the Line you have drawn for your Attendance is Justifiable and proper. I shall however press to bring your affair to a Hearing when Circumstances will admit.(1) General Washington most certainly has no leisure at present. This last affair has rais'd his Reputation very much indeed; & I think very deservedly.  Be pleas'd to Return any respectful Compts. to Mrs. Schuyler and the young Ladies; & believe me most respectfully, Dear Sir, Your most Obedt. humb. Sert. Jas. Duane  ""

  Dear Sir York 9th October 1777 This will probably be delivered to you by the Baron Kalb a Gentleman who has been long attending Congress with tenders of his Service in the Army & who was a few days before we left Philadelphia actually voted a Major General to be Commissioned one day antecedant to the Marquis delafayette.(1) This shows you the high estimation which Congress had made of the abilities & merits of the Baron, nevertheless from certain delicacies respecting rank on his part & other circumstances which are unnecessary to recapitulate the business which Congress had so much at heart became Stagnant & the Baron I believe is determined to return to France by way of Charles Town. At his arrival there I intreat you to wait on him & do for him every kind office which he will permit to make his residence easy & to facilitate his embarkation. I should have thought it a fortunate event if a Gentleman of Baron Kalbs knowledge in the Science of War could have been return'd even for our Southern department. Our Generals are good so far as their experience extends, but the deficiency in that grand requisite has cost America some thousands of Lives & will probably protract a bloody War which might have been [decided?] a Month ago.

  My Dear Sir York Town. October 10th. 1777, Fryday Evening I wrote to You this Morning the best Accounts I could obtain of the Battle of the 4th Inst.(1) I sent My Letter by Major Tarling Deputy Quarter Master of Georgia. This afternoon I was honoured with your favor of the 8th Ulto. inclosing the Petition of Brothers & Doffler, & inclosed is the Determination of Congress.(2) My motion being granted a similar one was prayed by Dr. Wetherspoone for some Damage done by Colonel Stone's Regiment. This produced an universal Complaint against our Troops. It is referred to the Board of War to consider of some general Regulation.  I have just seen Capt. Cox, who acted as Brigade Major to Colo.  OCTOBER 10, 1777  Stone. He informs Me, that Colo. Stone is wounded in the Ankle and is now at one John Shialy who lives at 32 Mile Stone from Philada. in Limerick Township, where he is attended by Dr. Craigg, Cochran & Wallace. His Brother is with him, and several Gentlemen from Philada. have offered him their Houses, but he is in too much pain to bear Removal at this Time. Major Forrest had his Thigh broke by a Musquet Ball. Captain Brookes received a Ball through his Mouth, which split his Tongue & went out at the back of his JawBone. Capt. Bowie was wounded slightly in the Shoulder. Capt. Lawrance was also slightly wounded. Colo. Halls Horse ran away with & flung him, but he is not much hurt. Major Cox of Baltimore Town is killed, and Colo. Marbury is missing. A few Subs. were killed and several others wounded. Capt. Cox further adds that our Loss is between 6 & 700 killed, wounded and missing, that our army marched from their Camp last Wednesday.  The Letter from Colo. to General Mifflin confirms the account we received by several Ways before of the Enemies Loss.  On the 5th we were in Possession of fort Island, and on that Day the Enemy withdrew their force at Billingsport to reinforce Genl. Howe. The Report of our retaking the Delaware was premature.  The Confederacy will be, I beleive, finished before Monday week. I will attend my Duty in the House of Delegates. Mr. Rumsey came here a few Days ago, on Business, & promised to releive Me when the assembly should sit. I wish Notice could be given to him of the day of the Meeting of the assembly.

It is strongly reported that the Delaware frigate which was either given up by Treachery (surrendered, or lost by an Accident of fire as some say) is retaken.

  York Town 10th October 1777 I have the great pleasure, my dearest Polly, of your favour of the 8th of September, which was not less than a month on the way. But the Satisfaction, which I long wished, it communicated by assuring me that yourself, my Children and our Friends in general enjoyed the Blessing of Health, and by the divine goodness had a fair Prospect of Security against the cruel Designs of our inveterate Enemies. I hope very soon to be informed of a happy Conclusion of the northern Campaign, and that it will be in my power to spend the winter with you between the Manour and Duanesburgh. I have with this View applied to Governeur Clinton for leave to return being sufficiently tired of Absence and publick Business.  Last Saturday another Battle was fought between the American and British armies at German Town about Six miles from Philadelphia. Such was the wisdom of General Washington's disposition, and the Ardour of the Troops that the Enemy gave way in every Quarter, their Grenadeers and Light Infantry flying with the utmost Precipitation and carrying along with them the Battalions which were to have supported them. All was Terror and dismay, & General Howe had already concluded to withdraw his routed Army into Chester and  OCTOBER 10, 1777  evacuate Philadelphia, where already the Inhabitants rended the Air with loud Huzzas for Washington. But see, my dearest Polly, the uncertainty of Human expectations, and more especially of the Events of War. The morning was extremely foggy, our Army were ignorant of the Extent of their advantages, for the several wings coud keep up no Communication. The General had directed the two Divisions after they had dispersed the Bodies of the Enemy against whom they were respectively destind, to unite: But having succeeded the Left wing was accordingly Approaching toward the Right, but by a fatal misapprehension they took each other for strong and fresh Reinforcements of the Enemy; and immediately, to the utter Astonishment of the British Troops, retreated, and, chiefly from this unhappy Error, gave up the Victory which in effect they had been crown'd with unknown to themselves. Thus, at least, is the matter represented. General Washington brought off his wounded & Cannon, his Loss in killed, wounded and missing being not more than seven hundred. Among the first is Brig. General Nash of North Carolina, an officer of great merit! General Howe has also lost several officers of distinction it is said, vizt. General's Agnew, Grant and Erskine,(1)two Colonels, & many other officers; between two and three hundred Waggon Loads of wounded it is said were carried into Philad. The number of the dead is also said to be very considerable and this is very probably the Case, as the Battle was long and attended with a pursuite for several Hours. General Washington since this Battle has been reinforced with 1200 Continental Troops & at least as many militia.  Be pleased to present my dutiful Regards to our dear & hond Father, Mamma, and every branch of the Family; and my Blessing to our dear Children, and believe me to be, with inviolable Fidelity, my dearest Polly, Your ever affectionate Husband, Jas Duane  P.S.

  Dear sir, Octr. 10th. 1777. I should have wrote to you long before this Time had I not been prevented by a lingering Sickness, which has not permitted me to attend so closely to the public Business as my Inclination would induce me, much less to attend to a Correspondence with my Freinds. I hope this will be received in Excuse for my Inattention to your kind Remembrance. OCTOBER 10, 1777  Among a number of Persons who accompanied Monsr. du Coudray from France (a Gentleman, to whom this Continent is in a great degree indebted for the very large Supplies of Artillery and Military Stores which have arrived in it) is a Person perfectly well acquainted with the Process of extracting and refining Salt Petre, making Powder, constructing Powder Mills on the best Principles, and in short with every thing which relates to the Manufactory of Powder.(1) Since Mr. Coudray has been unfortunately drown'd, this Person with several other valuable Officers and Artificers who came with him propose returning to France, unless Proposals should be made to them in order to induce them to stay in America. Mr. Duane and myself are extremely anxious that this Powder Maker, in particular, and two or three other Valuable officers should be retain'd for the service of our State: and we therefore wish that the Legislature would be pleas'd to vest us with discretionary Powers to offer such Terms to them as we shall think adequate to their particular Merits. You may depend on it that we will not abuse a trust, which we only wish to exercise for the Interest of our State.

  Sir, York Town Pennsylvania Oct. 10th. 1777 (1) I had the honor of receiving your favour of the second of September,(2) two days ago, and I am surprised you have not received four other of my letters since the 11th of August. I fear there is little dependence on our Post office for the safe conveyance of Intelligence. Since mine, soon after the Battle of the Brandywine nothing happened material in the movements of Genl Washington's Army, until the 4th Instant when he attacked the Enemy early in the morning. The particulars you have enclosed in an abstract from the General's letter to Congress. Poor General Nash is since dead of his wound, his thigh being shattered by a Cannon Ball. We lost several other brave officers and many wounded, the latter were all brought off the field. The Enemy as appears from a deserter had Genl Agnew, Col Bird & Col Walcot killed, with several other officers. Also Genl Sir William Erskine wounded in the head & ancle, it is said mortally. The whole loss of the Enemy by several accounts amount to about 800 killed and wounded.  I forwarded your letter to Capt Caswell by express. Our President enclosed it in his letter to the General. I have not the least doubt of his having come off unhurt. God send it may be so.  It gives me pleasure to hear Col Shephards Battalion is in such forwardness, and hope they may arrive here in time to be serviceable. Our affairs to the NorthWard wear a very promising aspect, since the late drawn Battle in that quarter, of which some time ago I gave you information. It is firmly believed Genl Burgouyn must meet with inevitable ruin. It is imagined Genl Washington intends very soon another attack on the Enemy's army. He has since that of the 4th Instant been reinforced by a large body from Virginia and Peeks OCTOBER 10, 1777  Kiln. I am rejoiced to hear the Tories have been prevented from carrying their infernal plan to execution. I hope decisive measures will be adopted to bring the Ringleaders to punishment.(3)  Congress have once more began to think of confederation, I could wish to know the sentiments of our General Assembly upon some Capital points. The method of voting by States was yesterday determined viz. that each State should have one vote, no Colony against it but Virginia.(4)The grand point of settling the Quota of Taxes each State is to pay, comes on this afternoon. Three proposals have been made, one to tax by the Poll, another to assess the value of the Lands, and the other to assess property in general.(5)The latter at present I think most equitable, should the confederation be agreed upon Mr Penn and myself will embrace the earliest opportunity of transmitting it to your Excellency, to be laid before the General Assembly. The Delegates of the several States are exceedingly anxious to finish this business, many assert that the very salvation of these States depend upon it; and that none of the European powers will publicly acknowledge them free and independent, until they are confederated. The time of Congress ever since my Arrival has been chiefly taken up with Army matters.  We have as yet no printing press, or Post Office established here. This will be done in a few days. I shall then have it more in my power to communicate to your Excellency every piece of interesting intelligence which comes to hand. At present I can hardly find time to write a letter, Congress sits from morning 'till night, and Committees 'till 10 & 11 Oclock. In fact I am almost tired of my troublesome office, and heartily wish to be with my family.

  My Dear Son, York Town 10th October 1777. Your favour of the 7th reached me yesterday Morning at the opening of Congress & as it contained some things new it afforded satisfaction to more than one. A witty Gentleman from a southern Latitude doubted its having been writ with your left hand & undertook to prove it was dextrously executed. Take care of yourself, I mean a little more care of your self, nay, if you won't do so to oblige me, do it that you may be the sooner & more able to gratify your [ruling] passion.  I have had the perusal of a very serious Letter from your General to a worthy freind in Congress, the Contents affected me exceedingly, I don't recollect a Man in my long & numerous acquaintance in the World nor my little reading whose circumstances were equally pitiable or whose merit in persevering & struggling against such difficulties is more admirable. We yesterday received a long Chatechistical Letter from General Sullivan the sequel of which is a desire to withdraw himself from the troops which gave me an opportunity of turning to a Gentleman, \""did not I tell you this would be the effect of stigmatizing an Officer upon the vague opinion & report of a Member of Congress.\"" What do you think 'though a very sensible Man was his answer? Why did they then use my friend Schuyler so? The Cases are by no means parrallel but admit they are, would you complete the ruin of the 13 United States because a Man in a party opposite to yours has done them an injury.(1)  It greives me to see an Assembly which you may remember I was wont to celebrate as the most august in the Universe, so frequently receive reprimands & more to know they deserve them. I can't suppose you have any influence with General Sullivan, otherwise I would intreat you to stretch it if necessary to prevail with him to retract his seeming determination. 'Tis not a bad maxim which my worthy old freind in Charles Town has often inculcated upon my mind, \""we should always take things from whence they come.\"" Applying this to the whole Body would rather aggravate the offence-but bodies are sometimes infirm & I say with very deep concern I never heretofore have been ashamed of being a Member-and truly if I did not think I saw a prospect of at least reducing the pernicious monster party, I would rely upon the Candor of my Countrymen & return to her without waiting permission. Upon second thoughts, this would not be wise.  We are now upon the Confederation, have surmounted one vast point-the Votes are to be by States & not by Voices.(2) The present question is the mode of Taxation. Two days have been amused in conning it, some sensible things have been said, & as much nonsense as ever I heard in so short a space, I have not contributed to either.  OCTOBER 10, 1777  I mean to expose my inabilities this Morning in a very few words because I think very few are necessary & very few would be made if we were about to Tax one State in which all were equally Interested. Candour & genuine honesty ought then to be our guides.(3) I wish it had been convenient for you & I to have sat an hour or two upon that paper. I should have consulted, I now inform you as one of my Constituents.  Tell me is it so that my old friend Grant is dead? A Letter from a Miss Lucy Leonard to General Mifflin asserts it. I also am told that Kniphausen & Sr. W. Erskine are on the same list. Poor Grant, I feel for him, this sort of Enmity cannot totally eradicate an old friendship.  I beg my Compliments to Your General & Colonel Pinckney & receive the present offering [. . .] as a little Morning Chat which friends will [adjudge?] it is often as insipid as this. If poor White is still among the Living I will indulge hopes of his getting forward. Tell him that his Wife nor his Brother does not more sincerely pray for it than I do.  Adieu, Henry Laurens  [P.S.] Beg my Complims. to Colo Hartly & tell him every body here very well, that the Kindness [. . .] in his House makes York less disagreeable to me than it seems to be to all my Brethren.

  Sir Pennsylva. York Town Octor. 10th. 1777 On the 4th Instant about Six in the morning Genl Washington Attacked Genl. Howe's Army in different places. The enemy were surprized and drove everywhere for three Hours. Our Troops behaved with great Courage and to the Honor tho they passed through OCTOBER 10, 1777  the Enemys Camp where their Tents were full of Cloths and other Things yet none stoped to Plunder. Genl. Howe was so alarmed that it is said Chester was pitched upon as the place for his army to retreat to but unfortunately at that instant two of our Collums mistook each other for enemies & both return in such haste that there was no such thing as rallying the Men. This was owing to a very great Fogg that lasted until after the Battle which Continued untill nine oclock, besides there was no Air to carry off the Smoke of the Guns so that a man could not see 50 yards.  The Enemy were astonished at our retreat as they looked upon everything as lost with them, they give General Washington great Credit for the manner of his Attack as they often tried but never could once Flank us, we brought away all our Cannon & nearly all of our wounded. Poor General Nash was Killed by a Cannonball with his Horse, his Brigade was to Act as a Corps-de-Reserve, I believe very few of Our Troops were engaged from what I hear and that Our worthy Genl. was Killed at a Great Distance by meer Accident, he was highly esteemed in the Army.

Your Son I am Told is very well, indeed the above are all I can hear of that belonged to No. Carolina that Suffered. We had no return yet of our killed & wounded, it is supposed to consist of about 700. The accounts given by different Persons make the Enemy's loss to be very considerable, they say that near 300 Waggon Loads of their wounded were sent to the Barracks in Philada, and that Genl. How refused to let the Citizens walk on the Field before the dead were taken care of. Genl. Agnew is dead, Sir William Erskin Wounded in the head supposed to be since dead & a very large number of others Killed & wounded. As soon as we get a return I will transmit them to Carolina. Genl. Washington has had a Considerable reinforcement from Virga. & elsewhere since the Battle. I hope he will give How another Stroke before we loose possession of the River Delaware, which would ruin him. Our men are in high Spirits on finding they can make the Enemy's best Troops run by Attacking them with Courage & are Sencible now if they had rallyed or not have been Surprized in the manner above mentioned that Genl. How and his whole Army would have been ruined. Our Affairs to the Northward are in a Good way. I hope soon to have it in my power to write you that Burgoyn & his Troops are in Our Hands. Inclosed is a letter from Buchanan Commissary Genl. relative to the Pork you mentioned.(1)  Please to inform Mr Nash that I will endeavour to have proper care taken of the Genls. effects for the benefit of his Family.

  Dear Sir, York Town Octr. 10th. 1777 I am honored with your favor of this date, and with concern I find the alarm taken by the State, at the hint thrown out respecting the calling of a Convention in a few hasty lines the production of a very few minutes while the Express waited. As my time is too much engross'd to take Copies of my Letters I cannot recur to what I wrote, but I meant only to convey this Idea that some real Friends of our State Members of Congress were of Opinion that the Salvation of the State depended on calling of a Convention, which was construed by Council and Assembly as appears from a Letter I am honoured with from the Speaker, confirmed by the Attorney General, into a serious Intention in Congress of interfering in the internal Police of our State so far at least as to influence into the measures in Question, whereas it arose in a tete a tete betwixt some, as I have already said, real Friends and myself, nor will you be be surprised with the sentiment when you are acquainted with the motives. It was publickly and confidently said in and out of Congress that a Quorum of the Legislature could not be got together.(1) And as the necessity of the Times required the most vigorous measures, and the season for taking the sense of the people for or against a Convention was at hand, their voice in Convention to lay down a system to be executed by Committees of that Body, dispersed thro' the State was thought OCTOBER 10, 1777  the best succedaneum for the want of an established Legislature, and such Laws compitent to the emergency of the times, which were not provided. That these Exertions were necessary to the Situation of the State, and it's safety and liberty would be provided for better than by the interference of Congress, until such Convention had appointed a Legislative Body. This was thought the best Expedient, for these Reasons, and might prove a healing measure to our unhappy Divisions. A mistake of the day of Election and that the Constitution had appointed the first Tuesday of this present month, which I could not contradict (as in the hurry of removing, my Copy containing the Constitution was mislaid) influenced to the hint offered you as above, for in this place there was not the least appearance of an Election, from whence it was judged that the people were in such a maze that the day of Election had throughout the State elapsed [. . .] (nor could I satisfy Enquirers on this head) or at best that a partial Election would obtain and our Country continue to suffer through want of exertion. Thus was I distracted until Dr. Ewing informed me that the Assembly and Council were preparing the most salutary Laws,(2) of which I am more fully convinced by the specimen of one put into my hands by Mr. Sergeant, which rejoiced my heart, and is a full proof that under my apprehensions there was no other way of supplying the very powers given but by a Convention. I heartily congratulate you on the concurring Providences which enliven the prospect of publick Affairs. I am very respectfully, Dr Sir, Yr. most obt. and very huml. Serv, Daniel Roberdeau  ""

I was pleased with your manly Justification and Appeal but as I had often rise in Congress for your Vindication against the Unjust & Malign Calumny of your Enemies (which every good, brave, spirited & Virtuous man will have) I could not bare after you had often braved & defyed every danger from the Enemies of your Country,  OCTOBER 11, 1777  You should prove a Coward when Attacked by your personal ones of your own Country, Sink under Unjust reproach, and Submit to the servile humiliating Terms of your Cruel foes, who have Attacked you with the poisonous darts of Calumny in order to effect the Very purpose of your quitting the Army which in the Close of your letter you tamely Yield to them.  Sir, you that have braved every danger for the sake of your Country: are you afraid of the reproach of your dastardly foes who by & by if you boldly attack them & maintain your ground which you are well able to do must servilely hide themselves behind the Curtain & sink under your Superior Merit. Sir you are not alone, you have friends enough in Congress & among your Countrymen who dare, & will Support you Against all their Malice & Envy which has allready recoild in a great measure on their own heads & must soon Terminate I dare say in their own Confusion. If you will only maintain your ground & boldly disdain to leave the field to the Triumph of your Enemies, all their Attacks will only tend to Illustrate your Carracter And make your Virtues displayed in the Cause of your Country more & more Conspicuous. If I had time & it was proper in the way of a letter I could give you a Satisfactory Account how your Enemies prevaild to Induce Congress to come into those hasty resolves which touch you so sensibly. I know you must feel them & you ought to, some of your friends I think Yeilded too much & believe they thot for the publick good. Sch____ ler & St. C____ r were Continually brot on the Stage, and no one but a N E_____d man could satisfye their resentments, & to have taken one of a low Carracter would not Answer their purpose. Therefore as they were to be brot to a Court of Enquiry so must you, as they must be recalled till an Enquiry could be had, so must you, or our Conduct must be deemed partial. This had an unhappy effect on some unwary & incautious, the bate took, it Catchd in an unlucky hour, or I may say moment, & was as soon repented of by some. They were brot to their senses before the Genlls letters come but that put it in their power to reverse the sudden decree.

But Sir never Yield to the Enemies of your Country nor to the Malignity of your personal foes till Providence, which I trust if you Continue & persevere in Virtue & the glorious cause in which your Engaged will give you a Compleat Victory over both-or if you must dye boldly die a Martyr & not with the reproach of a suicide.

Washingtons to be opened & read by you, but found afterward that the Bearer (a Boston returning Express) wod go thro Litchfield to Symsbury &c so I suppose you will not have the advantage of it & perhaps not yet mine very soon. I have since obtaind the Copy refered to & now inclose it, as also a Copy from J Miflin to Genll Miflin, which contains in substance all that We know about an Action which promisd the fairest of any that ever happened, but in a moment Victory was snatched from Us, when within our Embrace. There seems something very importantly remarkable in this Event, it is the hand of God, most conspicuously, we were not prepared for so great a Salvation. How happy shod we have thot our Selves had the Issue been according to the most promising Hopes, but we shod have ascribed it to our own Strength & Prowess & sacrificed to our own [. . .] &c & still I do not see that we are any more prepared to give Glory to the God of armys; how unnatural & shocking that We so much neglect & forget him in that Character, as well as in every other, & if We ever succeed against our Enemies, till we are generally brot to a deeper sense of our own Sinfulness & [. . .] of such Liberties & Privileges as no People ever before enjoyed it will be a most illustrious Instance of the Patience & Forbearance of the Almighty & all gracious God, & another Demonstration that He is indeed good to the Evil & unthankful & that his Mercy endureth forever but how unspeakably more happy & merciful wo'd be our deliverance & Salvation preceeded by or accompionied with sincere Repentance & Reformation & without it the Lords Controversie with Us will not be ended.  I mentioned in my last the Delaware Frigate was in the hands of the Enemy supposed to be betrayed by the Capt. The thing is true but not the manner which indeed is not perfectly ascertained. It is said the Crew, mostly British prize Sailors, rose against the officers, confined them & delivered her up. It is also said She was coming up against the City for good purposes, & was suddenly fired upon & disabled by a secreted Battery of the Enemy. I rather suppose the former. Since which it is reported that Cap Barre &c has laid her on board & retaken her, & was fully credited but a Letter from the office of the Navy at Burlington of the 5th recd last night does not mention it, but it may have happened since that Date.(1)  Genl Washington has been joined by B Genll Varnum from Peekskill with abt 1200 Men since the Action of the 4th (& I suppose Genl Huntington is also with him, as he wrote me he was coming) & by Virginia Militia so as to be, it is said, three thousand stronger than before. Whether he intends to attack How again we know not. Have no acco of the behaviour of the Connecticut Troops under McDougal in Greens Division but it seems they come up late.  There is a great Misunderstanding between Genl. Arnold & Gen Gates, which gives us much pain.  Congress have been some Days engaged on the Confederation Plan, & have decided the great Question in favor of each States having one Vote, tho greatly opposed by a number & to the great dissatisfaction of Virginnia.  Are now upon the mode & proportion of contribution, sundry plans are proposed, that of numbers is very strongly & forceably opposed, & the appearance is at present against it but I do not much expect we shall be able to find one attended with so few Exceptions or more equitable, tho I am certain this is far from perfect.

  Sir, York Oct. 12. 1777. I was present at the action of Brandywine and saw and heard enough to convince me that the fortune of the day was injured by miscarriages where you commanded.  I understood you were several days posted with the command on the right wing; that you were cautioned by the Commander in Chief early in the day to be particularly attentive to the enemy's motions, who, he supposed would attempt to cross higher up the creek and attack your flank; that you were furnished with proper troops for reconnoitering, and yet you were so ill informed of the enemy's motions, that they came up at a time and by a route which you did not expect; that you conveyed intelligence to the Commander in Chief which occasioned his countermanding the dispositions he had made for encountering them on the rout by which it afterwards appeared they were actually advancing. That when at length the mistake was discovered you brought up your own Division by an unnecessary circuit of two miles, and in the greatest disorder, from which they never recovered, but fled from the fire of the enemy without resistance. That the miscarriages on that wing made it necessary to draw off a great part of the strength from the centre, which exposed Gen. Wayne to the superiority of the enemy.  I heard officers in the field lamenting in the bitterest terms that they were cursed with such a commander; and I overheard numbers during the retreat complain of you as an officer whose evil conduct  OCTOBER 12, 1777  was forever productive of misfortunes to the army. From these facts I concluded that your duty as a General was not well performed, otherwise the enemy's motions on the wing where you commanded would not have been unknown to you during a great part of the day of action; nor could they have advanced by an unknown and unexpected rout, for you ought to have made yourself well acquainted with the ground. Nor would you have brought up your troops by an unnecessary circuit and in disorder, which exposed them to be surprised and broken.  I also concluded that the troops under your command had no confidence in your conduct, and from the many accounts I had officially received of your miscarriages I conceived and am still possessed of an opinion that you have not sufficient talents for your rank and office, tho' I believe you have strong dispositions to discharge your duty well.  I consider it as one essential part of my duty to attend to the appointments of the army and where I perceive that any person so unqualified as I deem you to be, has got into a command where incompetence may be productive of disasters and disgrace, it is my duty to endeavour at removing him. In discharge of this I gave to Congress all the information I was able, carefully distinguishing what I saw, what I heard, and from whom as far as I was acquainted with persons. I urged your recal with all the force I could, and thought it and still do think it necessary for the public good; because in all your enterprises and in every part of your conduct, even as represented by yourself, you seem to be void of judgment and foresight in concerting, of deliberate vigour in executing, and of presence of mind under accidents and emergencies; and from these defects seem to me to arise your repeated ill success. These seem to me to form the great essentials of a military character. Nor do I think you the only officer in our army who is deficient in them. Nor were my endeavours to free the army from insufficient officers intended to be confined to you. I scarcely know your person, and was not conscious of any injury from you. For a particular reason I should have had great pleasure in justly forming a better opinion of you; but no reason can induce me to overlook the defects of officers on whom so much depends. Nor will any thing deter me from pursuing the measures suggested by my own judgment. I have now related every thing which I acted, with relation to you in Congress, together with my motives. I have set down every intelligence, and the opinion I gave concerning you. What hills you struggled for, what fires you sustained, I neither saw or heard of. Your personal courage I meddled not with. I had no knowledge of it and I was cautious to say nothing unjust or unnecessary. My objection to you is, want of sufficient talents, and I consider it as your misfortune, not fault. It is my duty as far as I can, to prevent its being the misfortune of my country.  The purpose of this information is that you may indubitably know I gave Congress all the intelligence and opinions concerning you here set down; and then to ask in direct terms if you meant the disrespectful expressions in your late letter to Congress on the subject of your conduct at Brandywine, to be applied to me? If you did sir, I must inform you, you are mistaken in the matter contained in those expressions. My demeanour was entirely devoid of parade and ostentation and entirely simple and attentive. I did not gallop my horse at all but when I attempted to rally some of your flying troops.(1) The manner of those expressions, which I suppose you meant for wit and sarcasm, is as unbecoming the soldier as the gentleman, and inconsistent with that plain and dignified simplicity which ought to be the stile of persons in either rank. Were quaint witticisms my talent I should not (2)  ""

  Dr. Papa, York 12 Octo. 1777. P.M. 8 o'clock I have just read letters from Gen Washington of the 7th & 9th instants; the former covered a return of the killed, wounded & missing in the late action of the 4th instant vizt. in the whole 1609- killed 116-wounded 397-missing 849. These 3 numbers only make 1472. How the deficiency arises I know not perhaps from some error of mine in taking down the numbers. On recollection the above numbers consist only of rank & file & the 137, the deficiency are com- OCTOBER 12, 1777  Portrait of Charles Carroll of Carrollton  missioned officers. General Washington adds, since this return several of the missing have joined their respective brigades. Of the missing I suppose 1/3 are taken prisoners, the remainder have returned home or deserted into the country. By the letter of 9th it appears that the General has moved nearer the enemy in order to watch an opportunity of annoying or attacking them: he is now 26 miles from Pha. By all accounts the Enemy suffered considerably, particularly in officers. Gen Agnew killed, Gen. Grant dead of his wounds, Sir Wm. Erskine badly wounded, Ld. Cornwallis wounded in the neck. But we have no certain accounts of their total loss.(1) Our men are in good spirits and now think they can beat the Enemy, this opinion will probably contribute greatly to victory if we should attack again.  I fear the Enemy from N. York have got possession of Fort Montgomery in the highlands on north river. The Congress have recd. no authentic account of it, but the express, who brought letters from Gen. Gates of the 7th instant says he saw our frigates in flames, & Govr. Clinton, who had just time to retire from Fort Montgomery. We wait with impatience for the particulars of this event; Gen. Clinton means to open a passage thro' the highlands to Albany to come on the rear of Gates and relieve Burgoyne who can not advance, as Gates has three times his force & is strongly posted. Gates is strong enough to detach a part of his army to reinforce Putnam & still have a force superior to Burgoyne. They have Sunk Chevaux de frise a little above the highlands. If these obstructions are well done the Enemy's fleet may find it extreamly difficult to remove them, perhaps, impossible; in that case they must land their troops & march by land upwards of 100 miles before they can possess themselves of Albany.  I am informed by two gentlemen of veracity with whom I was acquainted in Canada, that they are confident Gates has now 20 thousand men; the Militia from Massachusetts & Connecticut were on their march when they came thro' those States. They left Boston yesterday fortnight & bring the following pleasing intelligence: that a prize was arrived at that city a little time before they left it with nine thousand pair of shoes & as many pair of stockings: a most seasonable supply. They were destined for the enemy's army at N. York & another prize was also brought into that port (a French vessel loaded with English property bound to Leghorn) whose cargo consisting of fine cloths will sell for 600,000 of continental money. The cargo (excepting a few bales the property of the Captain) was condemned; those bales & the vessel were given up as French property. By an intercepted letter in one of these prizes it appears that upwards of 200 French vessels were in the Thames freighted by English merchants to avoid our privateers. By a vessel from France, which brings accts lately in July they say an edict was issued by the King of France in consequence of the British act of Parlt. for seizing English-American property in whatever bottoms found & declaring that if   any of his subjects vessels having a regular clearance should be seized on that pretence, he woud demand restitution & in case of refusal make reprisals.  Baron de Kalb who a few days ago was made a major General this day set off from hence to join General Washington. He is said to be a very good officer. We stand much in need of such. We hear that several officers in General Steven's division have lodged complaints agt. him. I believe them to be well founded for Stevens (entrenous) drinks.  I hope this campaign will yet end successfully for us. If Gen. Clinton has no greater force than what we have reason to think he has (about 3000) altho' he should gain the forts in the high lands, if the cheveaux de frize can not be weighed up, I flatter myself he will not be able to form a junction with Burgoyne, or make so powerful a diversion in his favor as to give him the ascendancy over Gates. Washington will act on the offensive; and consequently must be stronger than Howe. The event of battles however depends on so many incidents, that it is difficult to decide for whom victory will declare. Our cause is just, our men are becoming more warlike, the blood already spilt will raise a spirit of obstinacy & revenge which will supply the place in some measure of discipline. We have many resources, if we have sense enough to [use] them; then let us hope we shall make use of them, and that we shall conquer in the end. My love to Molly, Mrs. Darnall & the little ones. I sincerely wish you a continuance. of health and am, yr. affectionate Son,  Ch. Carroll of Carrollton P.S. I had almost forgot to mention that the Enemy who had taken possession of Billingsport on the Jersey side of the Delaware below Fort Mifflin have evacuated in it-I suppose to reinforce Howe. The intercepted letter from England mentioned above complains much of the decay of trade, & intimated that unless something decisive is done this campaign great disturbances will arise in England. The letter is from a custom house officer to his friend or relation at New York.  ""

Having therefore a faithful Messenger going to Charles Town I have Sent it directly to Mr. President Rutledge indorsing your request in a particular manner of his attention to send it forward & referred to the directions which you had superscribed. It will probably be delivered into his hands on the 25th Inst. & I am morally certain he will find a good conveyance before this Month expires. I shall be happy if this measure meets your approbation.  No Letters that I can learn of are arrived for you from France but I here Inclose one which was delivered to me by Monsr. Dubuysson.  The Aspect of our Northern affairs is a little Clouded. General Putnam writes on the 5th inst. that 2500 of the Enemy conducted from New York in Transports & Convoyed by Men of War had landed within five Miles of Peeks Kill, that he had not 1000 Continental Troops with him & few Militia-of these he had made the best disposition, that Governor Clinton had arrived at Fort Montgomry whose presence he hoped would animate & bring in the Militia, but that in his present weak state although he would exert every nerve in the defense of the important posts committed to his charge, he could not warrant & did not hold himself answerable. He is a brave Officer in the field, cautious & timid only upon paper, therefore I am not diffident of his success. Before this day, I should suppose Somewhat decisive has been done in the special department under General Gates. OCTOBER 12, 1777  The Action of the 4th at German Town is a Subject for a condolence & congratulation, tis very evident we ran away from complete victory which had invited us to proceed & embrace her.

  My dear Brother, York Town in Pensylva. 13th Octr. 1777 I heared with much pleasure that you were destined to the Court of Berlin, because I think you may be able to do your Country essential services there. The power and the magnanimity of the Prussian Monarch puts him above apprehentions from the Court of London for pursuing measures dictated by true generosity and the interest of his people. A Port in the North for our Privateers, Prizes, and for the conduct of Commerce, will much benefit both countries. It is indisputably certain that a most extensive and mutually beneficial commerce may be carried on between the dominions of Prussia and the United States; but it is unfortunate for us, that whilst we are left singly to oppose the whole force of G. Britain (young as we are in war), we are prevented from giving experimental proofs of the benefits of our commerce, by the impossibility of sending our products, or getting those of other Countries. His Prussian Majesty has power, by a variety of ways, to call away much of the British attention from us and thereby facilitating commercial intercourse. Add to this, that the public acknowledgement of the Independency of these States, by his Prussian Majesty, would give dignity, and advantage to our cause, and procure the same acknowledgement from other Powers. The Committee have written so fully of the events of war in their public letter that I need not add here to what they have said; unless it be to say that our continued accounts confirm the great loss sus- OCTOBER 14, 1777  tained by the enemy on the 4th instant, in the battle of German Town. We understand that Generals Agnew and Grant are dead, and that Sr. Wm Erskine is mortally wounded. Some reports place Gen. Kephausen among the slain, and Lord Cornwallis with the wounded. Our Army is, by reinforcements, stronger now than before the last battle, in high spirits, and we expect will give Gen. Howe further amusement in a short time. Suffer me here to observe a little upon the enemies possession of Philadelphia. In Europe, where our affairs are ill understood, perhaps it may make some noise; with us, it is realy of little importance. When first we entered into this war, we not only considered, but absolutely declared that we considered our great Towns, as not defensible-But that the possession of these would avail little towards the accomplishment of the views of our enemies. In truth they are but spots in the great Map of North America. But it is far from being certain that Gen. Howe will retain Philadelphia two months. We know that during the last battle [he] had given orders for his baggage to cross the Schuylkil, and the friends of government, as he calls the detestable enemies of their Country, to quit the Town. Boston was once theirs, but now no longer so. It will be worth while to counteract the magnified falsehoods of our enemies concerning this subject. What is become of our brother,(1) we hear nothing of him. I have never received the Bark from Mr. Gardoqui, but you may be assured it is extremely wanted by myself and my family. I make no doubt but you will do the best for my boys in conjunction with their Uncle-but if they cannot remain to be tolerably finished in France, let them be sent by the first good opportunity to me.

  Dear Sir, York Town. Octr. 14. 1777. Tuesday Night By a letter from Genl. Putnam of the 8th from Peeks kill, we are informed, that the Enemy in the Morning of the 6th landed a Body of Troops, above King's ferry, on the west Side of Hudsons River; In the afternoon they attacked fort Montgomery. The Engagement was very warm & severe, both of Cannon and Musquety, for three Hours. The Garrison consisting of 600 Men, behaved with the greatest Gallantry & repulsed the Enemy (above five Times their Number) three Times; at length after an obstinate Defence the Enemy possessed themselves of the fort, about the Dusk of the Even- OCTOBER 14, 1777  ing, which favoured the Retreat of General James Clinton, Governor Clinton, several officers and a Number of privates. Our whole Loss in killed, wounded and missing is only 250. The Enemy suffered very considerably. Their Design is to releive Genl. Burgoyne. Govr. Clinton will exert himself to collect the New York Militia, Genl. Parsons is gone from Peeks kill to Connecticut to forward their Militia, who were coming in great Numbers to join Genl. Putnam.  Genl. Burgoyne on the 7th was encamped on the Heights on the west side of Husdons River, within about two Miles of Gen. Gates Camp on Beekemans Heights. The latter had then above 12,000 Men, & considerable Reinforcements of Militia, some say 8,000, were on their March to join him; the former had not then at most above 6000 Men, and Genl. Gates is informed not above three Weeks provisions. In this Situation he must either attack Gates in a strong fortified Camp, & force his Way, or he must retreat. To releive him from this distressing alternative Genl. Clinton is attempting to join him.  We have a letter from Genl. W. of the 10th, he was then 26 Miles from Philadelphia. On last Thursday Night about 12 o'Clock a severe & heavy Cannonade began between our Gallies, and a Party of the Enemy, who were attempting to erect a Battery at Webbes, on the lowest Ferry on Skuilkill. It continued till 8 oClock Fryday Morning, & was renewed on Saturday Morning. The Event is not known. It is supposed the Enemy design to cross over to province Island, & from thence annoy our Garrison in Fort Mifflin. The Enemy have attempted once or twice to raise the Chaveaux de frize, and were compelled to desist by the Gallies. Colo. Saml. Smith, of our State, commands at Fort Mifflin.  My Compliments to the Gentlemen of the Council.  Your affectionate Friend and obedient Servt. Saml. Chase  ""

  Dear Sir, Octr 14 [1777] York Town I made you a promise in my last to be more lengthy at next writing but verily I think it needless to say any thing about the affairs of General Washington's army as they stand at present, because it is impossible but that General Sullivan must have been very full to OCTOBER 14, 1777  your Assembly. He has been treated in such a manner as to make it his highest interest to be quite particular to his connexions. It may not be amiss, however, in me to give you the clue to our ill success in that part of Pennsylvania which borders upon the Brandywine where I hoped Mr Howe would be long detained, or I should have been less encouraging in some of my past letters to my friends. It was the opinion of General Greene constantly and also of Genl Washington himself that Howe's first object was worsting our army before he could attempt Philadelphia; but such was the wonder and discontent of most classes of people at having Philadelphia left open, by our army keeping always the right of Howe's left wing, with a determination to study a defeat of him in that part, that our General was obliged to post himself too long at Newark and gave Howe opportunity to cross high up the Brandywine. After the battle of the 12th it was a severe long continued rain that put our army into a condition unfit for battle and made a retreat necessary. For the enemy were without their tents as well as we, yet they had good blankets, were better clothed and had had tin cases for their cartridges while our men lost 700,000 as I have been well informed. It is inconceivable almost how they suffered by passing breast high through water sometimes, and by marches in some very hard country. The General now writes as if he had good hope of finishing the campaign well. God grant it. As to the Northern army, there is as usual a growing discontent among the leaders. I fear Arnold has taken for his motto, aut Caesar aut nullus, and yet is only an instrument in the operations of S_____ r.(1) It will be hard to prevent factions against General Gates with a known enemy and a very aspiring half friend at best in his department watching and writing at him.  I have information that not less success in prizes appears in your ports at the Eastward than what I told you of at Carolina; yet, it is said, every thing is extravagant. There is a very great want of shoes, stockings &c. in this Middle Army. I hope you will not be backward to supply them with your overplus, but I equally hope you will not suffer yourselves to be imposed upon as heretofore. You have thanklessly neglected your own soldiers through New England- let it be so no more. Indeed you have prevented exertions in the Middle States by your over-care for them.  Your friend and servant, J.L.  Tr(DLC).  1 That is, Gen. Philip Schuyler.

  Dr. Sir, York Town Octr. 14th. 1777 Your Letter for Genl. Gates waits an Express which I expect will go for the Nothern Department in a day or two. The late act appointing a Council of Safety is flattering to my expectations as the immediate vigorous exertions of that Board, (1) in cooperation with the Board of War here, which is ordered to correspond with the former and with their assistance to procure Shoes, Stockings and other supplies for the army, I doubt not will produce the most salutary effects. Genl. Washington writes that the Service is greatly impeaded for the want of these articles, that great numbers of men are detained in the Hospitals, for no other reason but that they are bearfooted, besides necessities of the Troops in the field. Shall this be permitted when our worst Enemies the Tories are abundantly supplied? Is it not reasonable to look to this quarter and that our avowed Enemies through the tract the Enemy passed and universally through the States should spare of their superfluities at least? and if either lack should it be our Army on which under God our lives, liberties & fortunes depend? Mr. Henry informs that greater quantities of leather is at Lancaster ever known; great quantities I am informed is also here, from Mr. Henry's account as well as by information from a principle hand here, the Tanners are willing to part with their Leather for green hides. The board of war has informed me they will order green Hides for Leather and have promised to write you on the Subject, but if it should be omitted through hurry, let this information assure you of the fact, as delais may prove dangerous, therefore I take the liberty to recommend to take the Leather at Lancaster and to do the same here and elsewhere I would have you aware that it is expected you will take the lead as it would be an interference with the internal police to do otherwise. I mention this to remove former suspicions and that you may expect no other than a constant Correspondence and such good Offices as the Board of War can render. With submission I think a number of Shoemakers should be immediately emploied and registered as Servants to the publick, and that what you do should be communicated to the Board of War and so vice versa that you may not unduely depend one on the other. It is recommended that in your dealings you give certificates. I am told by one of the Officers of the State that Coll. McCollester of a large number of Shoes, some concealed in his bed Chamber, has delivered but a trifling quantity, I mean to say that the Gentleman in whom the State has the fullest dependance gave information of the Shoes, and that the Board of War say comparitively few has been delivered. The horrid sience of extortion here is shocking, butter has got to 10/ per lb, Eggs 2/ per dozen and other articles in proportion, is there no way to put a stop to these enormities. I am not to direct to the irnmediate steps that may be thought necessary by the Board of OCTOBER 14, 1777  Safety, but I am bold to say no such effectual measures can be devised, as the strictest Oeconomy, opening the Courts of Justice and a heavy taxation, these will be more effectual than an Army with Banners as the Depreciation of our Currency is more to be dreaded, at present the people have no manner of use for money, but as soon as found necessary for Taxes, Court Fees &c, it will recover the credit of our money. Yesterday we are informed from Massachusets that they have laid on a second Tax, the first for One hundred & five thousand pounds and the latter for Three hundred & fifty thousands at the rate of 6/ to a Dollar. This seems an incredible burthen, but we are told the people cry out for heavy taxes well knowing that the money that remains in their pockets is of more value than the whole would be. Besides it shows their wisdom as the earliest Taxes will be most easily paid, on account of the great quantities of circulating Cash.  Fort Montgomery is taken but I trust by the exertions of Genl. Gates and his Army and the aids which I make no doubt will pour in to Peeks Kill, affairs will yet go well to the Northward, and may we not hope God will bless our Arms in this State. The mention of the State is enough to raise a blush for my Country. Can no way be devised to animate and call to our assistance the back Inhabitants. I forgot to mention that Indian Affairs both North & South, are in the most promising train, and Colo. Morgans account now here is no way discouraging to the westward.(2) Thro the medium of Congress a Rattle trap and Turkeys Tail was sent by numerous tribes at the Southward to their Brethren to the Northward, and Genl. Schyler informs that 140 had joined our Army and that many more were expected and what is more flattering that a number of the tribe of St. Francis had desired protection to their families, and liberty to remove to Connecticut. Some of the principle Articles of Confederation have passed, and I expect it will be finished in a few days, knowing this also is necessary to our Salvation. I am obliged to write you in this manner for want of time and having a miserable instrument in my hand. I hope my great freedom will be excused, as I have no other motive than the principle which influences your breast. With most respectful Regards to your Honbl. Board, I am respectfully, Dr. Sir, Yr. most ob. & very huml. Serv, Daniel Roberdeau  P.S. I write with the greatest confidence as well as freedom, as the times require it.

I have long foreseen, that We should be brought down to a great Degree of Depression before the People of America would be convinced of their real Danger, of the true Causes of it, and be stimulated to take the necessary Steps for a Reformation.  Government and Law in the states, large Taxation, and Strict Discipline in our Armies, are the only Things Wanting, as human Means.

  Dear Sir, York, 16 October 1777. Yesterday by the hand of Mr. Lawrence a Brother of my Neighbor at the distillery I sent you all the Intelligence of the day,(1) this Morning has produced me the enclosed Letter from my Son & Copy of Eastern Intelligence on which I congratulate with the freinds of America.(2)  Colo. Pinckney is not come in yet, I wish I had J.L.'s Letter by him, tis probable it contains minutia.  A long Letter this Morning from General Washington, (3) it does not appear that he has in contemplation an immediate attack upon the OCTOBER 16, 1777  Enemy, on the contrary he complains of the want of many essential articles. He is the most to be pitied of any Man I know. These essentials are to be had & now I suppose will be. Had they been provided sometime ago with those articles we should have prevented hundreds perhaps Thousands of desertions & there would have been no Howe in Philadelphia. O what my Pen could truly tell you would I indulge it. But I must not at present. A Letter from Camp General Smallwood of the 14th maintains notwithstanding Mr. Humphry's New Lying Paper that the loss of the Enemy in killed & wounded & prisoners the 4th Inst. was not less than 1600-indeed the glaring, the impudent Lies published under Gen. Howe's permission in Philadelphia which you will see in J.L.'s Letter invalidates every thing they say.(4)  Our President gave notice yesterday of his purpose to quit the Chair & Congress next week. I moved the House to intreat & solicit his continuance, to my surprise I was seconded & no more.(5)  Several other Members are about leaving us, I regret the apparent defection. Our House will be reduced in a few days to barely twenty or twenty one Members. Mr Hall now waits for me. I will only desire my Compliments to His Excellency, to Mr & Mrs Manigault, to Mrs. Gervais & to each other friend &ca.  P.S. Dont let the good News from Eastward lull you. The struggle here will be arduous but tis far from impossible & we ought to beleive it probable Ships & Troops will attempt a Winter expedition to the Southward. Let us be prepared-it will be Wise if there should be no attack-to be prepared may discourage an attack.  ""

Yesterday a Letter of yours of the 26th of Septr. came to hand, I fancy one of mine about the 8th or 9th Inst. is also lagging by the way.  The enclosed is from Major Butler relative to two Horses which he hopes are in Colo. Moylan's hand & if found to be sent to mine, if you learn anything of them be so polite as to inform me.  Poor Berry! I am sorry for him, James is absent today endeavouring to get Fish, when he returns I will enquire & if the Truss is in our possession send it on, otherwise get another when you let me know the side of the weak part.

I know the effects of loose Tongues, I know the cruelty of tongues speaking the fulness of designing hearts.

  Dear Sir York Town 16th Octr. 1777. I congratulate you most sincerely on the very important intelligence that I have now the pleasure to enclose you, which came express this morning to the President in a letter from Colo. Trumbull the deputy paymaster General.(1) We every moment expect an express from Gen Gates with a more full account of this glorious victory. Gen Clinton having received a reinforcement and knowing Burgoyne's critical Situation, was urging his way up Hudson River to relieve him, and had actually taken Fort Montgomerie on the Highlands, after a severe conflict and much loss. Gens Putnam and Parsons were between Clinton and Albany with some continental troops and a large body of Militia. This last General will now be compelled to return to his hiding place in the Island of York. The enemy have been foiled in various attempts to possess themselves of Fort Mifflin on Deleware, and were lately driven from Province Island by the Gallymen with the loss of 53 men and 2 officers taken, and a 32 pounder brought there to annoy our Fort.(2) Since the battle of German Town they have evacuated Billingsport, and it is now in our possession, where we have placed some large Cannon to stop their Ships. The General has sent a party to secure Red Bank, almost opposite the Fort, so that we have great expectations of preventing the enemy from getting to Philadelphia, in which case, Gen. Howe's situation must be a dangerous one. Our troops are now in possession of the Country all around Philadelphia and the enemy, so that their distress for provisions must soon be very great. What the people in Town will do, God knows. Sour flour sells already for 30/ hard money a hundred. In a short time I hope to send you more important news both from this quarter and the North. Our army is in high spirits, and advancing upon the enemy who are entrenching themselves. I am with great regard, dear Sir, sincerely,  Richard Henry Lee MS not found; reprinted from Henry, Patrick Henry, 3:102-3.  1 Jonathan Trumbull, Jr.'s October 10 letter to Eliphalet Dyer, which was read in Congress this day, apparently contained the first report received by the delegates of General Gates' October 7 victory over Burgoyne's troops at Bemis OCTOBER 16, 1777  Heights.

  Dear Sir York 17th October 1777 Since I wrote to you on the 14th August last, your favour of the 29th July has honoured me & requires my thanks for your kind attention to my distressed affairs at Wrights Savanna. The circumstance of March's temerity had been transmitted & my answer Sent to Coll Gervais Some time before the receipt of your Letter. It is impossible for me to give with precision & therefore I will not attempt any directions relative to the plantation above mentioned. I know you & my other friends will act for me as you would for yourselves, I shall therefore only remark that it will be necessary if Doctor Cuffee Should again come to that Plantation to exercise great Severity upon him & also upon Montezuma. Cuffee has been tr[e]ading in the Steps of his Mother who had long been the bane of my Negro families before She had corrupted & ruined March who before his connexion with her had been an honest orderly fellow. Severity or Seperation is therefore necessary, the former may reduce & reform, but I prefer the latter, if he shall make another elopement & come within your reach I intreat you to cause him to be Sent in Irons to Mr. Gervais whom I will authorize to Sell him. The removal of Such leaven may stop a contagion & when he is seperated from his Mother & other corrupters he may make, as he is very able, an excellent Servant. The Same also with respect to Zuma. I beg you will charge Casper not to let them slip through his fingers. I have already requested Mr. Gervais to attempt the Sale of Mary but I would by no means have either of these great transgressors be sold in the neighborhood of any of my Plantations.  I have regularly transmitted to Colonel Gervais the Intelligence from the Scene of War & Chamber of politics which you must have soon been informed of, indeed my time has been generally so fully engaged as not to admit of regularity or exactness in my advices but what I have omitted has been better Supplied by other hands & I have no doubt but you have learned every circumstance of importance which has happened antecedent to the present time.  We have our attention now, to three grand points. General Clinton of the Enemys Army with many Ships of War & about 5000 Men had penetrated Hudsons River so high as to take Fort Montgomery in which we had a Garrison of about 600 Men. Govr. Clinton of New York commanded & had the aid of his Brother Brigadier James Clinton, the latter was wounded badly in the thigh but with his Brother the Governor & about 350 of the Garrison after having bravely three times repulsed & killed many of the Enemy found means to make their escape. Our loss of that important pass arose from the desperate Situation of Burgoyne which had induced the British General Clinton to make as desperate an attempt to distract OCTOBER 17, 1777  our Arms in the Northern department & to form a junction or secure the retreat of that eminent manufacturer of Proclamations, & in order to effect this, tis highly probable New York has been Stripped of Troops & might have been taken by a very small body of spirited Troops if we had had such to Spare for the purpose. However I trust all will end to our advantage. We learn that Burgoyne was totally defeated about the 7th Inst. the day after Clinton had conquered Fort Montgomery, that General Gates's Army was in full pursuit of such as he had not been killed (1) or Captured & we expect every hour an Account of particulars from the General, in consequence of this happy event it will be easy not only to reinforce General Putnam at the passes about Peeks Kill but to bring the Enemy Clinton between two fires & to leave him no alternative but to fight under the greatest disadvantages or to get on board his Ships again & return to New York, content with having destroyed our Forts & two Frigates; losses which altho' very heavy to us are more easily repaired than the loss of Burgoyne's whole Army-to say nothing of the loss of his pompous Character for Generalship. Should events in the two circumstances above mentioned prove as favourable as I modestly expect, we shall then for our Winter's amusement have little to do but with General Howe whose Situation in & about Philadelphia I can assure you from good authority is already very uneasy to him. The purchase even if he should succeed & keep footing would be counted very dear. Depend upon it in the Actions of Brandywine & German Town their Loss does not amount to less than 3000 Men to which may be added at least another Thousand by Sickness, desertion & Capture. Many considerable, & to them valuable Officers, are included in the Loss. The British fleet have pushed hard to get up the Deleware. As hardly has the brave Commodore Hazelwood under amazing discouragements by desertions from his fleet, pushed them back again. What will be the issue God knows but unless the British fleet can come up to the City General Howe's Situation must be extremely hazardous as well as uneasy. If that fleet Succeeds & gets to the City our loss in shipping will be amazingly great, but their Army must nevertheless soon quit the Shore & March down by Water, the fleet will be so far beneficial to them but they dare not trust them in the River above a Month longer.  The present moment is big with events. When these come forth you shall be farther informed as fully as time will permit. &ca.  ""

  Sir War Office Octr. 18th 1777 I have the Honour to enclose all the Accounts we have in the Office of the State of Arms & military Stores. Lead is the most wanting & the Board have applied to Maryland & Virginia for an immediate Loan which it is hoped will be complied with as both these States have a considerable private Stock of this Article.(1) Chiswells Mines are at work on public Account & the Works are in but indifferent Repair. Govr. Henry is of Opinion that Considerable Supplies may be Drawn from thence. The Estimate is made only to the 11th of August as very little Additions have since been made of which authentic Intelligence has been received. Col. Flower can inform what Part of the Lead deposited in Pennsilvania has been consumed & what is become of the Lead which composed the Spouts taken out of Philadelphia. The Lead said in the Estimate to be at Baltimore was sent to Carlisle. I have also enclosed an Abstract of Arms &c delivered out at Philadelphia only which compared with the present Wants of the Army affords a disagreeable Picture of the Inattention to (Economy among the Soldiers &, it is to be feared, too many of the Officers. A few Pairs of Shoes have been collected & sent from this Place but all the Supplies from hence will be inadequate to the Demand. Perhaps 12,00 (2) Pair will be the utmost of the Collection this Way. The Board have sent to the Government of this State a Plan for siezing Blanketts, Shoes & Stockings from the dissaffected in Chester County & other Parts of the State which they are desired to communicate to your Excellency & request your Cooperation therein. With what Vigour & Dispatch this Plan will be executed by the Council is yet to be determined,(3) but certain it is the speediest Exertions are indispensibly necessary or Consequences of an alarming Nature must follow. Col. Flower as soon as his Place of Residence is known will be written to on the proposed Amendment in the Cartouch Boxes. Would not a Piece of painted Canvass answer the Purpose of lining the Flaps so as to guard against Rain? Leather is extremely scarce & indeed hardly to be procured at any Rate. I should imagine that much Leather might be saved in Cartouch Boxes if only the Front & the Flaps were made of that Article nailed on the Wood which might be blackened & made to look very well. I am told many of the British Cartouch Boxes are made in this Way.  I have it in Direction to request a General Return of the Army with which Congress have not been favored for some Time past.(4)  I have the Honour to be, with the greatest Respect, Your very obedt Servt, Richard Peters Secy  ""

  Honourable Gentlemen York Town Octr 18th. 1777 We have the pleasure of inclosing to you the copy of a letter from General Gates containing the circumstances of a Victory gained over General Burgoyne on the 7th.(1) This event must defeat the main view of General Clinton in proceeding up Hudsons River. He has, it is true, got possession of Fort Montgomery, but with much Loss, as we hear. Though the enemy may boast at this acquisition yet we are persuaded the consequences will be little profitable to them, as Governour Clinton of New York & his Brother Genl. James Clinton are acting vigorously in concert with Genl. Putnam who commands in that Quarter.  Our army under General Washington is numerous & in good Spirits, while General Howe is busied in forming obstructions in the roads leading to the City of Philadelphia by which he supports his hopes of keeping our troops from routing him out of his stolen Quarters.  The enclosed Resolves (2) need no comment from us, being sufficient of themselves to determine your conduct in the points to which they relate.  It is with concern we find that British property has lately been covered in French bottoms; which practice pursued, and American Search disliked by France, it is obvious that the most vulnerable part of Great Britain-her Commerce-will be secured against us, and that by the intervention of our professed friends. We desire therefore, Gentlemen, that you will confer with the Ministers of France on this subject, and satisfy them of the propriety and even necessity which there is that either this commerce should be prohibited, or that the United States be [at] liberty to search into & make distinction between the bottom and the enemy's property conveyed in that bottom.  To prevent ill impressions being made by a number of Officers who are returning to France we think it proper to observe that, without totally deranging & endangering even the annihilation of the American Armies, it was not possible to provide for many of those  OCTOBER 18, 1777  Gentlemen in the manner they wished, and which indeed some of them had stipulated for previous to their leaving France. We have done (3) all in our power to prevent discontent; but no doubt there will be some whose dissatisfaction will produce complaints & perhaps misrepresentations. You will be guarded on this head, and represent our conduct as founded solely on the necessity of our situation.  We are, Gentlemen, With much Regard, your very humble Servts,  Richard Henry Lee James Lovell  Thos. Heyward Junr. Jno Witherspoon ""

4349,dg008125,1777,John Harvie to Thomas Jefferson,"""John Harvie to Thomas Jefferson
  Dear Sir York Septr. [i.e., October] 18th. 1777.(1) This Morning the Inclosed Interesting Intelligence was received by Congress from General Gates. As I am sure you will receive pleasure in reviewing even the Minutia of this great and Glorious Victory I shall make no Apology for sending you a Copy of the several Letters in the Rough dress you see them haveing made it off in a Hurry at the Clerks Table.(2) Gates's Rapid Successes to the Northward does him honour as a Great and deserving Officer. The British General Clinton some short time since reduced Fort Montgomery on the North River and placed a Strong Garrison in it. However Sanguine Spirits here prophecy his Speedy Evacuation of that post. I wish the Event may Evince the truth of their prediction but as I know nothing of the place I have no Opinion about it. We yet Command the Delaware above Fort Island and the Enemy have been repuls'd with some Damage in every Attempt that they have made on our Batterys and little Navy. The Commodore is a Gallant Oficer of whose conduct Congress have expressed their high approbation. The president inform'd me to day that there are a Body of troops in Motion for Wilmington. Probably a few days will bring  OCTOBER 18, 1777  us good News from that Hospital. General Washington is within 17 Miles of Philadelphia. His design no doubt is once again to force the British Lines. His troops are Ardent and Spirited therefore we may hope every thing from their Vigour and Activity. Our Agent from Martinique writes that he has every reason to expect an Immediate War in Europe. Pennsylvania is at present a dead weight on us. Their Councils and Executive are puerile weak and Inanimate. They deserve to be D . I have not patience with them, and Yet they think it Matter of Right to Engroce every Office of trust and profit. I verily think a Majority of them would willingly see us Involv'd in the deepest destruction. However for their Comfort they have Martial Law Suspended over them for 70 Miles around the City. This Resolution pass'd before I came to Congress or I should have had my doubts about the propriety of the Measure.(3) As we have no press from whence you might see those things in print I thought it might partly Ease your Solicitude to give you this detail of publick Matters.  You'l hear of the Dunmore Militia's behaviour when Order'd to Camp. Pray do not suffer them to Escape Reprehension, or their Example may be fatal to our Militia. They say they could not be provided on the Road. I enquir'd at Frederick town as I came down and their pretence is without any kind of foundation. A well Regulated Militia may be our Salvation and Officers who are not Attentive to their duty ought to be broke like Glass and certain I am the Dunmore Feild Officers were not, two of whom are Delegates for that County. As you wanted your Workmen from Philadelphia you are Sensible they cant now be Engaged from that City. This gives me Uneasiness as there is no man on Earth for whom I would Execute a trust with greater pleasure. I have not yet had a very clear distinct View of Congress but have seen and heard enough to Convince me that it is not that Wise Systematic decent Assembly that you knew it two years ago. If I was with you I could enlarge on this Subject but at a distance Sub Silentio (for fear of Accidents) is the best policy. I fervently hope the next choice of Delegates for our State will be Confind to men of extensive political Knowledge, Steady and Spirited in their Rights with Capacity Sufficient to penetrate the designs of every Corner of the Continent. Rely on it our Confederacy is not founded on Brotherly Love and Able Statesmen are Surely wanting here. To make room for one of this Character I will with pleasure Resign if you Advise me that it will not be Imputed to Unworthy Motives (but that would restrain me if the Service was as bitter as Gall) for to you who know me so well it is Needless to say I do not possess talents for State Affairs and yet truly I am one of the Board of War without having the Skill in Military affairs of an Orderly Sergeant. Our Worthy president withdraws from Congress in about 10 days. Will you be Surprised if F. L. Lee Esqr. Succeeds him? That he will is the General Opinion at present. I wish in a publick  Assembly no Gentleman was fond of high Offices. I have not heard a tittle from my Family since I left it. My wife is certainly Reprehensible for not writeing. Yet perhaps she is Excusible as I never knew her so Negligent before. As she really Merrits every tenderness from me, I feel the Strongest Anxiety to hear that she is well. I kn[ow] she cant be happy in my Absence. I am Dr Sir With the Greatest Sincerity Yrs, Jno. Harvie  ""

  Dear Sir York 18th October 1777 I have lately troubled you with many Letters Vizt. 18 September, 5th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 15th Inst. & one of the 9th by Baron de Kalb who is since gone to the Army & I believe one of which I took no minute, all the public Intelligence which at each respective date I could collect accompanied those Letters.  Yesterday I stole a few minutes, & cast a respective glance over your obliging favours of the 4th, 10th, 11th, 16th, & 29th August, 1 st & 11th September & Shall profit by one hour to spare before the Meeting of Committee to speak briefly to part of each. Your kindness will excuse & find means to supply deficiencies.  If my memory does not fail me I have already informed you that Grouber was to have been paid only £45-in the whole £10-of which for assisting to conduct the Chariot certainly by Mr. Heath- the remainder by him or me according to my Letters to which I referred. If he has asked a farthing more than £45 he is dishonest.  You will have learned before this can reach you the event of Mr. Geo. McKintoshs attendance upon Congress.(1)  I am very well pleased with your directions concerning the De- OCTOBER 18, 1777  sertion from Mepkin &ca but I am now confirmed that Doctor Cuffee will perpetuate if I keep him the mischief which his Mother has been long practicing among my Negroes. Therefore I request you to sell him, he served five years to the Shoemakers Trade & could & no doubt can now make a very good Shoe, he is a good water Man, a Sawyer & has abilities for every kind of Plantation work but let him not be Sold to live near my other Plantations, you will See this is going a Step further than I had intimated to Mr. Brisbane-& let Zuma follow him immediately to Sale if he once more elopes or comits any capital fault.  I will say nothing about public faith & public Credit in observation upon the intended Lottery, save this-Congress finding the Tickets had not sold equal to their expectations had given orders sometime before the evacuation of Philadelphia for drawing, but that circumstance is & must for a time continue to be a farther obstruction.(2) If you were by this Fire Side where I most devoutly wish you were for an hour, we could enter upon the Subject of public faith & public Credit. The knowledge I have obtained of both has carried my Ideas to such lengths & depths as tire & overwhelm me. I stand in need of an honest, sensible, diligent freind to back & support me, there are Men here who see as deeply as I pretend to do, but they content themselves with seeing, or with barely saying they see, & wish somebody else would take the trouble of investigating facts. Such as I have too often experienced, there are in the world, Men who though honest in their own transactions, will suffer the public stock to be squandered, misapplied, embezzled rather than lose appearances by a Manly opposition against certain characters but I will take up no more of your time on this painful topic.  My Ideas upon the Continental Certificates if I do not misunderstand you, exactly coincide with yours.(3)  Capt. Arthurs Appeal is now before the proper tribunal. I am one of the Bench but upon this occasion holding my duty to be to support the Cause of the State which I have the honour to Represent as far as Justice will accompany me, I desired & obtained leave to act on the part of the Appealer & not as Judge. An opinion will probably be delivered about three days hence; according to my present Insight, the Decree will be confirmed. A very candid sensible Man has said he was surprized the Judge had not committed the proctor for the Indecency & Insolence of certain terms & phrases in the Appeal.(4)  The detention of your Packets & Letters at the House in Charles Town does not at all surprize me, tis the effect of a very groundless jealousy which has made its appearance very visibly in this quarter also-pity & contempt attend them.  My poor old Stepay, I wish we may meet again & that in the meantime Loveday may not suffer my Garden to go to wreck, indeed I have a right to expect & do expect he will improve it considerably.  Colonel Tarlon lately took the trouble of a pair of Flax Hackles to be delivered in his way to Charles Town at Mepkin, he intended going that way & to call at Cumingtee. The Chief Justice's reply to the Georgia Proclamation will please himself as little upon a review as it has pleased his readers in this part of America at first Sight.(5)  Your Assembly made a Short Session but surely long enough to have nominated two or more Delegates in the room of the Gentlemen now retiring. This my Dear freind is an important concern, let me intreat you bring it upon the tapis the very first day of your next meeting, & if possible obtain leave for my return & come yourself. But for God's sake for our Country's sake send men of diligence as well as understanding. You will send none whose Integrity is doubtful.  The Prizes which have been carried into your port have (6)  20th October [1777] I have been an hundred times taken off, I can say no more at present but to congratulate with you & all the friends of America on the amazing events which have lately happened & which you will read in papers here inclosed. Illuminate your Houses-illuminate your Hearts with gratitude to God & do good to your fellow Creatures- illuminate your Heads & prepare your Selves to meet the Enemy at your own doors & to repel them. By a Note which you will see I had put at the foot of one of the inclosed papers I did expect Burgoyne in his Strong Camp had nothing to eat. Hunger is as powerful as Lead. Adieu my dear friend.  P.S. I wrote to Mr. Brisbane & to Casper before I left Chas. Town to give Mr. a Barrel of Rice which was what he requested for his S[t]aying at Wright Savanna.

Besides the Resolve above mentioned Your Excellency will receive with this Seven more (1) which the President has desired me to forward upon my application to him for blank Commissions for Privateers, of these the President intimates he can at present Supply only fifteen, when they come the exact number shall be mentioned.  The Board of War have entered into Resolves by which 'tis intended to take General Howe out of the Brigadiers List & to call him to General Washington's head Quarters. This arrangement will probably afford Satisfaction to the General & at the Same time remove from our State a bone of contention, every body here as far as I have been able to learn are Surprized his Command in South Carolina has given offence to any one.(2) In the Same paper Your Excellency will See that Mr. Massey is recommended for Dep. Muster Master General for South Carolina & Georgia. The Resolves are to be reported to  OCTOBER 19, 1777  Congress to morrow & I have no doubt of their being confirmed without debate.(3)  When we had retired from the War Office yesterday I requested of my Colleagues a public Letter might be prepared for Your Excellency but as I hear nothing further I take for granted that Mr. Middletons hurry to get away to morrow & Mr. Heywards engagement with the Committee of Intelligence have been bars to my wishes. I shall therefore transmit to Your Excellency duplicates of Letters received the 17th Inst. from General Gates with additions of such articles as have come to my knowledge & their authorities.  The welfare of South Carolina is ever a Subject of your Excellency's attention & Study, therefore without an apology, I intreat Your Excellency to consider how essential it will be in order to promote that great end to urge the House of Assembly without further delay to complete the number of our Representation in Congress, if I apprehended no other cause of Complaint but merely that of the burthen of business which will lie on me in a few days when Mr. Heyward shall also have retired I would be Silent, but as a Citizen I have a right to complain of the insufficiency which that event will occasion in our Representation & if it Should be continued to blame those for neglect of Duty whom the public have intrusted with the Guardianship of their Estates & Liberties.

4355,dg008131,1777,Richard Henry Lee to George Wythe,"""Richard Henry Lee to George Wythe
  Dear Sir York in Pennsylva. Octr. 19, 1777 I have once before, since our session here, given you an account of the progress of war in these parts and further North, but the irregularity of the Post gives reason to doubt whether you have received my letter.(1) The boasting Burgoyne having been beaten in two pitched battles is on his return, with his shattered army, but whether he will be able to get back or not, time must discover. The want of a Press here obliges us to furnish manuscript accounts of military events, and this is attended with great difficulty amidst the pressure of much business. You will for this reason excuse my referring you to the inclosures sent Mr. President Page,(2) for a full account of the last action with Gen. Burgoyne & an entertaining correspondence between him & Gates subsequent to the battle. Danger appears now to be thickening about Gen. Howe, so that I hope to be able e'er long to give you favorable accounts from the neighborhood of Philadelphia.  Permit me now Sir to trespass a little on your time and friendship with my private concerns. I am sure to be indulged by the latter and therefore more confidently complain of the malicious perseverance of my enemies, who, I am informed, propose to bring my letter to Mr. Scot before the approaching session of Assembly.(3) It is realy difficult to say whether the folly or the malice of these people is greatest, but it is certainly very insultive & degrading to the Great Council of the Commonwealth, to make it a Court of Scandal, and a Vehicle for conveying Slander against the reputation of innocent men; when the great and important affairs of Defence, Finance, and Courts of Justice, call so loudly for quick and wise determination. Let the date of my letter to Scott be attended to, the State of paper money at the time, the reasons and principles upon which my proposal was founded, and my conduct will appear not only innocent but laudable. For it is certainly praiseworthy to prevent ones family from ruin by means that are just and fair.  (If by a proper reflection upon Men and things, It was clear to me that my rents established under different laws, from the present, and upon principles that then appeared proper and permanent, would most probably, by the change that was working in our political system, be rendered of little value, where was the harm in proposing n change, by which I might be saved from ruin, and the Tenant not injured? Nor could this have operation upon a currency that then scarcely began to exist and which from its then scarcity was as good as any money whatever. In truth it was so scarce, that my Tenants either could not, or would not get it to pay me my rents, but offered me produce in lieu of money. In fact my plan was rather to affect futurity that the present time, and a bargain made before the existence of the currency could not be intended to injure it.) The question then is,  OCTOBER 19, 1777  was I obliged by law when these contracts were made, to receive any thing like the present currency in discharge of the rent reserved. You Sir will say no. When therefore the exigence of public affairs rendered it necessary to issue such quantities of paper money as to lessen its value some hundred per Cents, and that a law should be made to establish its currency, this being subsequent to, and destructive of private contracts made under the faith of former laws, should not Individuals be saved from the retrospective destruction wrought by the change. And the more especially in instances where this can be done without injury to the other contracting party. For in this case the Tenants produce rises in value in proportion to the superabundance of circulating money. Reasoning upon the probility of the change, and as a good Citizen, willing to procure a just alteration before events took place that might render such an attempt liable to misconstruction, I long since endeavoured to procure that which would only in good faith obtain the original design of both the contracting parties. And this point of reason and justice would long ago have taken place without murmur or noise had it not been for some malicious enemies, Pseudo Patriots, and a few Knavish Tenants, who under the cloak of public spirit have raised this clamor. Perhaps I may be considered as standing in the way of some private views. My wish is only to lend my helping hand to fix the independence of America on wise and permanent foundation, and then with infinite pleasure I will return to my farm and eat the bread of industry in freedom and ease. I have no doubt Sir, but that you will on all proper occasions, as well upon principles of justice to injured character, as on account of the long friendship that has subsisted between us, place this matter in the clear light that your abilities enable you to do. It is long since my letter to Mr. Scott was written, and having mislaid the copy, I do not perfectly remember its contents, but conscious of the purest intentions I am sure that no sentiment can be found therein inconsistent with virtuous patriotism. And after all it will be a ridiculous gratification of private malice for the Assembly to take up the consideration of such an affair as this. I have inclosed you a letter from Colo. Marshall to me on the subject, and one to yourself from me,(4) which I leave to your discretion and friendship to produce to the House or not, if any attempt shd. be made there to my prejudice.  I am, with particular esteem, dear Sir, your affectionate friend and obliged humble servant, R. H. Lee  ""

  Dear Sir, York, Pennsylvania, Oct. 20th. 1777 I have the honor to enclose to your Excellency an account of the Surrender of Genl Burgoyne and his whole army on the 14th Instant, the particulars are not yet come to hand, but this account is so well authenticated, that Genl. Washington on receiving the intelligence ordered 13 Cannon to be fired, and the Bells in this Town rang for hours.(1) The two armies near Philadelphia were on Friday last within 7 miles of each other, and a General Action is expected daily. Should we be successful in this Quarter, we may pronounce I think with certainty America Free and Independent. Your Excellency will be pleased to excuse my not being more particular at this time.

  Dear General York 20th October 1777. Your favour of the 28th August reached me the very Evening of the peoples's flight from Philadelphia. I fled not. Having foreseen from amazing remissness where there ought to have been the utmost attention & vigilance I had sent forward my Baggage, followed it that Evening & next Morning after many thousands had passed by me I made my breakfast, filled my Pipe & soberly entered my Carriage, drove gently on to Bristol, took in the wounded Marquis delafayette & proceeded to Bethleham, thence to Reading & Lancaster. Here Congress were soon convened but hearts were still fluttering in some bosoms & a motion made for adjourning to this Town. We have been here about twenty days. Within this time frequent opportunities have offered but I chose to defer paying my respects to you till I could say something to the purpose & fortune has now thrown much in my way. I refer you to the papers' which will accompany this.  As I have no doubt the report of the Board of War will be this Morning confirmed I will take it for granted, & with great pleasure congratulate with you on your promotion. The removal I hope will rather afford you Satisfaction, it will place you in a more honourable Sphere & withdraw a Subject for contention by a people some of whom of both parties I am persuaded you Love & esteem & I perceive those good people were dividing fast. The motion the Notice I mean for an intended Motion in the Assembly at their next meeting is now barred & a great deal of ill grounded debate Strangled. I will say nothing further on the Subject but to tell you that I am happy in this event in which my endeavours & wishes are crowned with Success. Let not my happiness be abated by learning that you are not perfectly Satisfied. Rank has been hitherto Strangely conducted & occasion for complaint given to Some brave Officers. These however have in general Submitted to the Resolves of Congress & there have been but few instances of Resignation; hereafter we may expect more accuracy & regularity in Army arrangements from an establishment of a new Board of War.(1)  I congratulate with you also on the News from Saratoga. This Intelligence will make your generous Soldierly heart bound with joy surpassing every feeling from circumstances confined to your Self. While General Howe keeps near his Canoes we can entertain no well grounded hopes of adding a Knight of the Bath to our list of prisoners but upon my honour if Hazlewood perseveres in his manly opposition to the fleet & that our Fort Mifflin & Cheveau de frise are sustained a few days longer such an event will begin to be possible. Already his Situation is rendered very painful to him & as General Washington has again approached within ten Miles of his Camp we may expect every hour to hear of another action. His vicinity however keeps the  OCTOBER 20, 1777  Enemy from Sending detachments to act in aid of the shipping. General Potter as we are just now informed in his late March towards Chester intercepted a brigade of Baggage Waggons, took the whole Guard prisoners & among other articles four or five Brass feild peices & upwards of three hundred & fifty New Tents.  I am writing in Congress. This moment came to hand a Letter from General Washington inclosing a very long, apologetic, expostulatory, Censorious, Rascally epistle from the Ir-Revd. Jacob Duche. Take what follows from Memory.(2)  He apologizes for his connexion with the freinds of America & with Congress as their Chaplain in language which confirms the opinion I have for Six Years past entertained of him-vain glorious insincere Man-in my estimation the worst Character in the world.  He expostulates with the General on the danger to which America is now exposed of total ruin, marks in Striking terms the State of our Army (as it appeared to him in low Spirits a few days ago), our Navy, our finances, our weak dependence upon France who have been from the beginning & who now are duping & leading us to our destruction & who mean never to afford us any effectual aid particularly never to consent to the establishment of American Independency. Under these heads he expostulates with the General to reflect upon his own situation, depicts the present Congress in terms unjustly very dishonorable to several States & contrasts to it the Characters of Some of its original Members who Says he, were the Men in whose Service you entered & not the present Set. Here is Jesuitism indeed nor is he less bitter against the Officers in the Army. He is Severe upon those Members of Congress who were Sent to treat with Lord & General Howe last year, charging them with insurity, insincerity & inconsistency- Labours to prevail upon the General to use his influence with Congress to rescind their Resolutions for the Declaration of Independence, to Cease hostilities & finally the Rascally part in the Superlative comes forth-if all arguments Should fail \""you have one infallible Resource still left\""-\""Negotiate for America at the head of your Army.\"" Need I comment on this infamous performance, can conscience his pretended guide dictate a Sentiment so base? I'll Send you the whole Letter by & by although tis very long.  To what a low an ebb is Britain reduced when her Ministry are constrained to make use of Such Engines?  Surely this has been calculated as a preparatory Step to purchasing our brave & honest Commander in Cheif. When I send you Copy of his Letter I shall couple with it one of his Studied Celebrated prayers for Congress-the contrast will shew the rottenness of the priests Heart.  This moment is reading the Report of the Board of War. If I do not contradict it depend upon it you are Major General. Depend upon it also I am with great esteem & respect.   P.S. I saw good Reasons while the Report was in debate for altering my opinion & therefore combated my own Recommendation to call you from So Carolina.(3) Your promotion & the Resolution of Congress Sent to you by Mr. Middleton will remove all jealousy of your Command. I hope you will approve of this, stay among us, continue to live a Life of temperance & Chastity & acquire greater Glory. The Commanding Officer of So Carolina & Georgia is moving in a Sphere preferable to Major General without a particular Command.  ""

  Dear Sir, York the 20th October 1777 Your favor of the 16th I received yesterday, and was a good deal surprised to find you had been told that Congress had appointed Gen. Conway a Major General.(1) No such appointment has been made, nor do I believe it will, whilst it is likely to produce the evil consequences you suggest. It is very true, that both within and without doors, their have been Advocates for the measure, and it has been affirmed that it would be very agreeable to the army, whose favorite Mr. Conway was asserted to be. My judgement on this business was not formed until I received your letter. I am very sure congress would not take any step that might injure the Army, or even have a tendency that way; and I verily believe they wish to lessen your difficulties by every means in their power, from an entire conviction that the purest motives of public good direct your actions.  The business of a Board of War is so extensive, so important, and demanding such constant attention, that Congress see clearly the necessity of constituting a new Board, out of Congress, whose time shall be entirely devoted to that essential department.(2) It is by some warmly proposed that this board shall be filled by the three following gentlemen, Colo. Read, Colo. Pickering the present Adjutant General, and Colo. Harrison your Secretary. And that Gen. Conway be appointed A.G. in the room of Colo. Pickering. It is my wish, and  OCTOBER 20, 1777  I am sure it is so of many others, to know your full and candid sentiments on this subject. For my own part, I cannot be satisfied with giving any opinion on the point until I am favored with your sentiments, which I shall be much obliged to you for Sir as soon as your time will permit. It has been affirmed that Gen. Conway would quit the service if he were not made a M. General. But I have been told, in confidence, that he would leave it at the end of this Campaign if he was appointed, unless his word of honor were taken to continue for any fixed time. And it is a question with me whether the Advocates for Gen. Conway will not miss their aim if he should be appointed A. General, unless he has the rank of Maj. General also. My reason for thinking so, is, that I have been informed Gen. Conway desires to retire to his family, provided he can carry from this Country home with him, a rank that will raise him in France. It is very certain that the public good demands a speedy erecting, and judicious filling of the new Board of War; and I sincerely wish it may be done in the most proper manner. I do not imagine Congress would appoint Colo. Harrison without first knowing whether you could spare him, nor do I think that so important an office as that of A.G. should be touched without maturest consideration.  We every moment expect the Express with an account that will enable us to congratulate you on the surrender of Gen. Burgoyne and the remains of his shattered army. This will be one of the Prussian sixes, and I augur that the other will soon cast up upon the Delaware.  I am, with sincerest wishes for your health and success, dear Sir your most affectionate and obedient servant,  Richard Henry Lee ""

  Sir Pennsylvania York Octr. 20th 1777 General Washington attacked General Howe's Army the 4th Inst near German Town, the enemy were surprized and gave way in every quarter, we drove them for three hours, and should undoubtedly have obtained a Compleat victory had not two Divisions of our Troops mistaken each other for enemies and retreated, disorder soon took place and it was impossible to rally the men again. General Howe was so alarmed that it is confidantly aserted he had given directions to retreat to Chester, had we not saved him the trouble.  This misfortune was owing to a great Fogg and no air, to carry off the smoke, which prevented a man's seeing fifty yards, our Soldiers behaved with great resolution (& some pushed Bayonets) untill the mistake happened.  General Nash was wounded by a Cannonball early in the engagement & died two days after, his death is greatly to be lamented, he was highly esteemed by all that knew him. Colos Buncomb and Irwin were taken prisoners. We have the pleasure to inform you that those of our Countrymen that were engaged behaved well.  The enemy's loss must have been very considerable, as there were it is said near 300 waggon loads of wounded carried to the Hospitals in Philada. General Howe refused to suffer any of the Inhabitants to walk on the field, untill the dead were taken care of. General Agnew was killed in the action, General Grant we are told died soon after, Kniphauson, & Sir William Erskine were wounded, the reports differ whether they are dead or not. General Washington has been busie in preparing every necessary for another attack, which by letters from some of the officers in his Army we expect will be every hour, and as the spirits of our Soldiers are great, in Consequence of there having discovered that they can make their enemies run, we hope for great things. Should General Howe meet with a defeat he will be ruined as we are still in possession of the river Delaware.  We Congratulate Your Excellency on the great & important success of the Army under the Command of General Gates. The account we had from Colo. Trumble several days ago differed little from Gen Gates's letter, that with others from him & Genl. Burgoyne we inclose for your amusement.  OCTOBER 21, 1777  Yesterday we were informed by a letter from the Chairman of the Committee at Albany directed to a Friend of his in New York, that Burgoyne & his whole Army had surrendered themselves prisoners of war, it is generally beleived here, indeed it is nothing more than what we expected as that army had very little provision & were few in number compared to ours.  The Revd. Mr. Duche has acted such a part as will for ever disgrace him, in short he may be said to be the first of Villains, we can not help suspecting that the letter he wrote to our Worthy Genl. must have been dictated by a Howe, the design of the letter was to prevail on the Genl. to negotiate Terms for himself & Army. You know, administration have tried Bribary & Corruption, nothing is too dirty or mean for the British Court & those that are employed against us, however we Trust that the day is not far off when we shall all be free & happy. The confusion the different Clerks have been in for some time with regard to their books &c has prevented our getting a Copy of the account of such sums of money as has been received by direction of our State, we will inclose it as soon as we can possibly get it, to your Excelly.  Doctor Burke left us last week, when he set out for North Carolina. We are with due Respect, Sir, Your obt. Servts.  J Penn Cornl Harnett P.S. Mr. Duche remained in Phila. & of course fell into the enemy's hands.  21st. Burgoyne & his whole Army are prisoners. I have seen Govr. Clinton's letter this morning giving an account of the matter. General Howe has run away & recrossed Schuylkill, our Army is in pursuit of the runaways. Our little Fleet has kept the river agt. Lord Howe & all he could do, the Roebuck & another large Ship are rendered unfit for service. The day is ours. John Penn  ""

  Dear Brother York Town Octr 21. 1777 My Absence from Philadelphia in July last, upon a Committee to the Camp, prevented an earlier Answer than that wch You received to the Letters mentioned in your Favour of Sepr. 22, containing Matters of Importance; altho I am often under the Necessity of so far yeilding to the pressure of publick Business, as to omit answering the Letters of my most intimate Friends. OCTOBER 21, 1777  The Prices of the Ticklenburg, Twine, & Needles, which You took for the Inhabitants of the Town, cannot be ascertained untill I see Colo Chase; as to him is referred the Settlement of the prices of the other parcells, first intended to have been payed for here. The Russia Duck which You want for your own Use, I will lend, & You will also be pleased to take what is wanted for the True Blue, if she should be again fitted out on our joint Account. I think it adviseable to purchase, rather than sell, notwithstanding her Cruises have not been remarkably successful.  The Risque which You unavoidably took of the other Privateer, without Doubt intitles You to the Share of all her prizes, which You had Advices of, previous to the Receipt of my Letter; after that Time, the Bargain was compleated, & had the Vessel been taken the Loss would have been justly mine, notwithstanding such Capture might have happened some Time before You received my Letter, therefore the share of all prizes, of whose Capture, Advices shall have arrived after you received my letter, will by the same principle be mine. I cannot advise You at present to send your Vessel to Virginia, but am in Hopes that the Bay will be much less infested about the latter End of next Month, before which Time You may think it adviseable to pursue the other plan mentioned in your Letter. The Money wsh I mentioned before to have been overpayed by Messers Purviances shall be repayed to Mr Cary, whenever he shall have an Oppertunity to adjust the Matter. I have minuted the 50 Dollars wch You recd from Mr Saunders and am sorry to hear that he is no more.  With respect to publick Affairs, I think Providence has of late remarkably favoured our Cause, & to him alone be all the Glory. The News of the Captivity of General Burgoyne with his whole Army, which We have recd from Governor Clinton, is great, & has had such an Effect on General Howe as to induce him to leave German Town, so that my next will I hope be dated at Philadelphia. If the States are vigorous, they may destroy the Residue of the British Army in America before Reinforcements can be sent from Britain, & thus put an End to a most unnatural & inhuman War. I had forgot to mention, that the Enemy suffered greatly (as was imagined from the Accounts collected by Major Clarke from Philadelphia) in the last Action at Germantown; their Loss is supposed to have been at least 1500.(1)  My Love to Mrs Gerry, Brothers, Sisters & Little Friends & believe me to be yours very sincerely, E Gerry  [P.S.] Their General Agnew is killed & their [. . .] supposed to be mortally wounded.(2)  ""

We also had some other Letters sent by Genl. Mifflin from Officers in our Army, That General Howe had begun two days ago to retreat towards Chester, that part of his Army had crossed the Schuylkill & that we were in pursuit of them.(1)  Commodore Hazlewood has been too hard for Lord Howe, who Commanded in person, in the last action the Roebuck in which his Lordship was and another large ship were rendered useless.(2)  I hope we shall soon have Howe's Army in possession, as our Troops are in high spirits having had the account of our success in the Northward & must exert themselves or be totally eclipsed by the Militia of the Eastern States. Eight thousand are gone to drive the enemy from Rhode Island, they are landed, Howe cannot stay here if we don't take him.

Providence has so ordered but we have not any blame cast upon any particular officers from any quarter as yet, tho the Genll as far as I can recollect distinguished some & particularly your self for Good Conduct & Bravery in that Action. I hope your Jealousys may prove without foundation, the General whenever Occasion has offered, has mention'd your Merrits with particular pleasure and Appeared to Wish for no ones services in the Army more than yours, and I do not recollect that in any letter to Congress he ever Mentioned Genll G____n (2) to have began that Action, or even to have Acted at all in it. His conduct in Camp or at Head quarters you can best Judge of, but in his letters abroad you Appear as much his favorite as any officer I know. There may be persons who may Wish to sow the seeds of discord & jealousy from the worst of Motives, & tho every Gentn ought to be upon his guard yet at the same time very cautious least he be imposed upon by specious & pretended friends, who to evince themselves real ones, will be Indeavouring to Stirr up Jealousies & discord between those who ought to be so, I dare say you will readily distinguish them. The Gent from N____H____re you mention,(3) am well persuaded has no very Cordial friendship for you. You know him & I need say no more, but in Justice to him I can say that on every Occasion wherein you have been attacked in Congress he has thrown in his mite in your favour and given his Vote against every measure which has been proposed Against you. But to Conclude, you may rest Satisfied that you have obtained a Compleat Victory & Conquest over your Enemies in Congress (& those who have Attackd you without). They now ware long faces, they hang their heads, they are mute, you will hear no further from them; every Attack that has been made upon you is now despised. Your friends not only rejoice but Triumph, all the malice of your Enemies is disarmd of its Sting, & Venome. Therefore I trust you will pay no more regard to the barking tribe but Shine on; every Attempt of detraction, instead of Effecting its purpose & design, has had a Contrary effect, & placed your merit in a more Conspicuous light, than if no attack had been made upon you. The glorious Success to the Northward I hope will enspire every breast with Emulation & That Genll How may soon with his Army be in the same Situation with his brother Burgoyne (not even his bonds excepted). Heaven prosper you and may our future Attempts against our Enemies in this Quarter, be Crowned with Compleat Success. I hear my son who you knew last year is now Lt Coll in Coll Chandlers Regiment, McDougles Brigade. After a long continued illness almost ever since the Battle of Trenton has lately joined his Regiment. If you see him your kind Notice of him once in a while would be esteemed as a favor. Am with sincere Esteem & regard, yr Hle Servt, Elipht Dyer  ""

  Dear Sir York Pensylvania Octr. 23d. 1777 A Gentleman is just arrived in Town who has been Lately in Genl Gates Camp & says he saw Genl Burgoyne with Our General. The Account he brings of the Surrender of the British is as follows: that 1 Lieut General (Burgoyne), 2 Majors General, 7 Brigadiers, 2 English & 1 Irish Nobleman and a Great Number of Officers and 5000 Privates were taken together with 40 PS. Brass Cannon, 15,000 Stand of Arms, a quantity of Cloathing, Warlike Stores, Baggage &c &c.  It is however surprising that Congress has received no[t] a Line from Genl Gates on this important Matter. Genl. Howe has removed his Army into or near the City & Genl Washingtons head Quarters are at German Town. Our people have as yet kept the Command of the River by possessing the Fort & Assisted by our Little fleet who have repulsed the Enemy's Ships Twice. A Report privails that the Defyance & Roebuck were terribly Shattered by Our Gallies a few days agoe. Shew this News to Msrs. Hooper & Maclain &c. Your Letter to Mr Mitchel I sent to him & he acknowledged to me he received it. I never could get a Sight of John Daldson all the time I was in Philadelphia. I beleive he is ashamed to see me. The family live in the Country as Also Mr. Mitchel, West, Fuller & indeed all my old Acquaintances. I saw Mr. Tate about 2 weeks before I left Philadelphia, he told me had had seen Jackey a short time before that in good health at Burlington the Week Congress fled from the City, I intended to go to Burlington on purpose to See him. Let me know whether I am to bring him home with me in the Spring. I shall take Care to get him to me.  Negroes are not to be purchased at any price you would Choose to give. Neither Can I meet with a Distiller, all the Tradesmen except such as would not Choose to remove are in the Army, or employed by Congress at Excessive high wages. You had better employ a Distiller from Charles Town. I am entirely Satisfied with the Sale of half of the Distillery, & Mr Bru[. . .] Appointment to the Management of it. I congratulate you on the Success of the Compys. Vessels. You will be pleased to acquaint me who are the Members Chosen for Our Counties about C Fear & remember me kindly to all my friends. I have not time to write to any body but yourself & Mrs Harnett.(1)  OCTOBER 23, 1777  Give me the Prices Current in Wilmington of Tavern Charges, Market Stuff & Other Necessaries.

  Sir York. 23d Octobr. 1777 It is with the utmost degree of pleasure I congratulate with you on your recovery & return to the Army, where I hope every circumstance will conspire to make you happy that you may have opportunities of gratifying your thirst for glory & I pray God to protect & preserve your valuable Life.  Permit me the honour Sir, to congratulate with you on the amazing Success of the American Arms in the Northern department. I scorn to triumph over even an ungenerous Enemy, but from my own feelings I am persuaded if I had been capable of publishing such a Braggadocio proclamation as we saw in the Month of July (1) & of following it with such daring menaces & unmanly acts of murder upon Women & Children as we have been witnesses of, I should have Surrendered my Self to a Pistol Ball in preference to becoming the prisoner of those people whom I had reviled by the Epithet of Rebels & every ignominious term. From the advantages of a River, an opposite Shore & a numerous powerful fleet I can scarcely hope & yet I cannot repress the wish, that your Army may have the honour of adding a Knight of the Bath (2) to the list of English Captives.  Your polite notice of Mr. Jno. Laurens lays a farther obligation on me, it afforded me pleasure to learn he had done his duty & I flatter my self he will persevere. If General Sir William Howe will faithfully transmit accounts of all preceding actions & consequences in the present Campaign he will afford his Master new matter for a Speech to Parliament.  I have not seen the French Gentleman who did me the honour to bring your Letter,(3) but will enquire of your black servant where he may be found & you may depend upon me Sir to attempt, at least, to OCTOBER 23, 1777  Serve him, nor Shall the Subject concerning Mr. De Valfort depart from my mind. I will this very morning inform my Self of the opinions of the War Office respecting that Gentleman. Mr. de Valfort is here, he called upon me the day before yesterday in order to get me to interpose in a dispute Subsisting between himself & a Waggoner relative to the freight of Baron de Kalb's Baggage, I censured the delinquent Carrier in Severe terms & recommended Mr. de Valfort to apply to two Gentlemen to arbitrate in the Case & I am told they have done him justice by mulsting the Waggoner very considerably. I do not think the Justice complete-it was easy to demonstrate the Baron's damages to have exceeded the Amount of the whole intended Freight. If Baron d'Kalb is not in the Army I know not where to address him, therefore think it best to return your Letter under this Cover.  Congress are apprized of large quantities of Clothing arrived from France & Spain but unfortunately at the distant ports of Boston, Charles Town & New Orleans. Distant as these are I have strongly urged the necessity of bringing the Clothing even in Waggons, the expense is not to be Set in competition with the Lives of our poor Soldiers, and if we consider, not too deeply, we might add our own Lives also, but I am afraid no measures for effecting this great purpose are yet in motion. I do not count the lost days to be in October but in January when the Cold will be intense. I will without fear of offence move again in this matter before the present day passes.  I have enquired very minutely of Mr. Morris relative to Packets for you from France he declares he never Saw nor heard of one. Will it be difficult Sir to confront the Post Master by Mr. Bedaux & Mr. Buhannan. A Letter to the Post Master might bring about an explanation. If he is in this Town you will soon hear further on the Subject. I will take the Liberty to question him very closely.  I have Seen a Letter containing London Intelligence pretty late in July. The Privateer in Capt Week's Squadron of three not very Capital ships out of France had made immense prizes in the Irish Channel & Spread such terror the Linnen Ships expected from Dublin &c were detained in port & the great annual Fair at Chester intirely empty & disappointed, a circumstance which never before happened from its commencement. Capt Weeks with 3 little Barques has effected more than has ever been done by the United powers of France & Spain. I construe this event in a manner differing from the opinions of Wiser politicians, the people in general in Ireland are our freinds & will use Stratagem to frighten the Ministry. Weeks however & his Subcommander were ordered by the French Ministry to be taken into Custody immediately upon their return & were actually in confinement at the same time their Ships were with great celerity fitting out for another Cruize.  \""The Merchants had made two Representations to Lord North in  one was Stated the Loss of Great Britain at Sea Three Million Six hundred thousand pounds Sterling-in the other a much deeper Loss by the Balance of Trade with America thrown into the Lap of a Rival Power. The Loan for five Million had been soon filled by Subscription but payments were exceedingly tardy. Stocks had in earnest begun to fall & foreigners had also in earnest taken the alarm. \""  Nothing that has happened in America Since July can administer that distracted Country, consolation. If these things are not new I have been impertinent, I beg you will be so good as to ascribe the trouble to that sincere respect & regard with which I profess my self &c.  ""

Should you be fortunate in taking any prizes suitable for Sale in the West Indies carry them with you giving notice thereof to Mr. Stephen Ceronio or in his absence to Monsr.

  Much Hond & dear Sir York Town Octo 23d 1777 This acknowledges the receipt of your kind particular Favor of the 14th Inst by Mr Brown. Had sent you a Packett of the 6th by a Boston returning Express passing thro Litchfield to be thence forwarded to N Haven, where I supposed the Assembly [was sitting, with?] an Acco of the Ger. Town Action &c, & [one of the 11th by a man?] of Woodbury going directly t[o N Have]n, which hope you have recd. We hear a returning Express from this, was shot off his Horse by the Enemy, cant learn where, supposed to be Storrs, sent by Col Trumbull, & chargd with Letters & drafts for money in his Favr., Letters from Col Dyer &c &c. I cant recollect that I sent any by Him, I think He set off a day or two before Brown's last return. Congress have on your recommendation, agreed to pay all Browns Accos. &c as Express & directed that he have them settled by the Comisrs at Hartford & that he be continued in Service, as a Continental Express.(1) Since my last Congress have made considerable progress in the Confederation, & have this day passd the 6th article, with addition that the Dutys &c dont interfere with the Terms of the treaty already proposed to France &c also the 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th & 11th the last with a further Exception, as to Pirates. I hope it [will soon?] be got thro with. I wish it may [be ready?] before the assembly rises but it [is impossible?] to say, how other matters may int[erfere.]  Our last Accos from the Army are that Genl How has retired into the City with his whole Army, & erecting every Work of Defence in his Power from River to River. That the Vessels of Force Gallys, & Fort Miflin make a gallant Defence. The Enemy are pushing at them with great earnestness, & it is said a very heavy Cannonade has been heard (even here) all the Morning, supposed in that Attempt. Genl Washington has recd. & instantly transmitted to Congress with contempt &  OCTOBER 23, 1777  Indignation an astonishing Letter,(2) of 4 sheets from our late Chaplain, the great Patriot, Whig & reputedly very pious Mr Duche who stayd in town wherein He [. . .] & regrets his own Conduct in taking [. . .] paints Congress in a most con[temptible . . .]ted Light, unworthy Wretch [. . .] by all the respectable Characters [. . .] composed it & a pack of Attornys, Bankrupts & Men of desperate Fortunes, the Officers of the army no better, & the whole as a ragged Banditti, our Finances desperate, the Army beaten & driven, the navy despicable, taken, burnt & blocked up &c, & every misfortune exagerated, & magnifies the mighty power of How, the vast Ease with which he has possesd the Capital of America, the impossibility of resisting him, ridiculing the Idea of French asistance &c, the prospect of being now restored to Grace & Favor & constitutional Liberty, & professing the greatest affection for him (3) & conjuring him to recommend a Cessation of Hostilities &c &c, that all rests upon him solely & intirely as there is not a Man in America to second him, or keep his Men together &c & if every thing else fails, to Negotiate for America at the Head of his Army.  A temptation & a t[ryal of such?] Magnitude & Design, second to no[ne since the?] Prince of Devils, practiced upon our first Parents, but blessed be God, it did not find an Eve. If I had Time it wod be needless to descant upon the more than infernal Turpitude, Baseness & Folly of the Wretch. If I can obtain will eer long send you a Copy. There has been a debate, whether Copys shod be sufferd, is not forbidden, tho there were many minds.  You are kind enow to mention the affair of my Kinsman, if he shod settle on the Terms, in the wretched State of our money he must starve without question, all the Hope is in the restitution of its Credit, if it please God to prosper Us, that must be the case, & without the former [. . .]tter for the latter nor any other [. . .] affair but I find my Bror. d[. . .] (4) or can stay.

  Sir, York October 24th 1777 The Secret Committee of Congress being dissolved we have been appointed under the Stile & Title of the Commercial Committee to take up and continue the Business. We find they wrote you a long Letter on 12th June by Capt. LeMere to which we refer you. The present serving to acknowledge the Receipt of your Letters by Capt Pickles addressed to a former Committee of Congress which we have laid before Congress and by some inattention of the Secretary are now mislaid.(1)The chief purport being to advise us of the arrival of some Stores from Spain intended for the Service of this Continent and of the very favourable Disposition of the Governor Don Bernardo DeGalvez, we shall proceed to say what is necessary on these Subjects. Herein you will find inclosed a Letter for the Governor (2) which please to deliver and procure it to be well translated into Spanish for him, in this Letter we have requested him if Money be wanting in New Orleans for the due Execution of our Business to furnish what may be needful under Assurance that it will be repaid by our Ambassador at the Court of Spain and we doubt not he will comply.  This precaution we have now taken in consequence of Mr. Morris informing us that he finds you have made some Remittances on his Houses Account that will reduce the Balance he expected in your hands. With respect to the Stores sent out from Spain to New Orleans for our Service we are anxious to get them soon & safe to this part of America where they are much wanted & would be very useful. We have had it in Contemplation to order them up the Mississippi to Fort Pitt, but the length of time that would require, the heavy Expence & the Danger of Robbery by Indians has deterred us; therefore OCTOBER 24, 1777  we must trust them round by Sea and for this purpose we desire you will charter or purchase suitable sailing Vessels sufficient to bring the whole.(3) The Authorities vested in you by the Secret Committee we hereby confirm, and the Instructions contained in their Letters of which we now give you a Copy are quite sufficient for your Guidance in this Business as well as that they committed to you. We therefore recommend the same precautions they urged but beg you will expedite the Departure of those Stores as much as you can. Capt. Pickles tells us he has a fine Brigantine suitable for the Business of Bringing a Cargo along the Coast. If that be the case and the Governor & you should think him a proper Person to be employed you will agree with him accordingly. We have wrote the Continental Agents in Charles Town So Carolina (4) to hire or buy a suitable Vessel to carry Captain Pickles to New Orleans and that Vessel may be loaden back with part of the Stores. We shall cause another small Vessel to be sent from Virginia to carry Duplicates of our Letters and if she arrives safe she may be employed in the same Service. We are desirous of sending you supplies of Flour, as that would furnish Funds to answer the Demands this Business will occasion, but unluckily our Enemies Ships of War are so numerous as to block up effectually at present all those ports from whence that Article can be exported. We hope however to find them other Employment before long and shall be glad of Openings to make your frequent Consignments of this & other Articles.  We inclose you herein three blank Commissions for Privateers with the bonds & Instructions which we send you in full Confidence as our Agent that you will not grant them to any Persons but such as you know will strictly comply with the Terms prescribed in the Bonds & Instructions. If you should think it best to arm the Vessels which you purchase to bring the Stores for these States those Commissions may be filled up for them. We are &c.  ""

I hope I am doing right.

The Action of the 7th when the Proclamation General (2) quitted with the field of Battle, his Tents, Camp Equippage & much Baggage & also bequeathed his Hospital of wounded Officers to the Victor had been whispered here three or four days before we received an authentic Account.

I think I have seen that Provision has been made by the Legislature of the State of Rhode Island &c, agreable to the Resolution of Congress of 31st July, I wish the last Resolutions also of Congress of the 17th of Oct. may meet with the Speedy Attention of the Genl.

A Considerable Time before We left Philadelphia I recd. of the Secretary of Congress twenty Vollumes of the Journals of Congress, & in hopes of meeting with some opportunity of sending them, I had them packed up in a Box, but when we came away I was necessitated to send them over into the Jerseys under the Care of a Gentleman who removed them. I have now procured twenty other Vollumes & those I before recd. are to be replaced in their Stead if no Accident happens to them. Mr. President Hancock being upon his Return to New England, has been so kind as to take Charge of them & says he expects soon to be in Providence himself & will carry them with Him.

Congress ordered each State a like Number.(4)  I enclose your Honor Copies of several Letters which will shew you the agreable Situation Affairs are in here. If the Enemys Shipping can be prevented coming up to the City, It must prove fatal I apprehend to How's Army.  It is with peculiar Pleasure that I reflect upon the Honor which the Rhode Island Battallions have acquired to Themselves & their State.

And to their Bravery under Heaven, & not to the sufficiency of the Works is that Victory to be attributed.(5)  We last Sabbath was a Week, had Accounts very Direct from Albany that Genl. Burgoin had surrendered himself and his whole army to Genl. Gates.(6) But to this Hour Congress has not a Word further from that Quarter. This raises Doubts with us, but before this, if it be true, you are well informed.  I am anxious to hear the Success of the Expedition upon Rhode Island. May Heaven bless the Attempt.

  Sir York Town October 24th 1777  As quickly after you receive this as your Ship can be provided for the Voyage,(1) you are to proceed to France, and when there you are to be directed as to your future Cruize, and the disposal of your Prizes, by the Commissioners of the United States at Paris. For this purpose you are immediately on your arrival to send a trusty officer to acquaint the Commissioners of your arrival, and to receive their directions. Until you receive their answer it is left to your discretion and the inteligence you may collect of the enemies Cruizers, whether to remain at your Port of arrival, or make a Short Cruize, and repair for the reception of their answer to any other port; taking care to inform the Commissioners of your determination on this point.  Whatever supplies of any kind you may want for the Ship in France you will apply for, either to the Commercial Agent in France or any correspondent of the Commercial Committee at the Port where you may be, or to the Commissioners at Paris.  We would have you make as little shew as possible of being a Ship of Force, when you arrive, and during your stay in any Port of France; and let your stay in Port be as short as possible. It is not necessary to direct a person of your discretion to be very cautious of communicating to any person, either in America or in France, what is your destination or what your orders. If the Agents of the Commercial Committee of Congress should direct you to take on board Merchandize for France you are to follow such directions concerning this, and the delivery of the goods as you may receive from that Committee.  We desire you will correspond with this Committee by every suitable opportunity. Wishing you health & success, We are sir, yr Friends & hble servants  ""

  My best Friend York Town Octr. 25. 1777 This Town is a small one, not larger than Plymouth. There are in it, two German Churches, the one Lutheran, the other Calvinistical. The Congregations are pretty numerous, and their Attendance upon  OCTOBER 25, 1777  public Worship is decent. It is remarkable that the Germans, wherever they are found, are carefull to maintain the public Worship, which is more than can be said of the other Denominations of Christians, this Way. There is one Church here erected by the joint Contributions of Episcopalians and Presbyterians, but the Minister, who is a Missionary, is confined for Toryism, so that they have had for a long Time no publick Worship. (1) Congress have appointed two Chaplains, Mr. White and Mr. Duffield, the former of whom an Episcopalian is arrived and opens Congress with Prayers every Day. The latter is expected every Hour. Mr. Duche I am sorry to inform you has turned out an Apostate and a Traytor. Poor Man! I pitty his Weakness, and detest his Wickedness.  As to News, We are yet in a painful Suspense about Affairs at the Northward, but from Philadelphia, We have Accounts that are very pleasing. Commodore Hazelwood, with his Gallies, and Lt. Coll. Smith in the Garrison of Fort Mifflin, have behaved in a manner the most gallant and glorious. They have defended the River, and the Fort with a Firmness and Perseverance, which does Honour to human Nature.  If the News from the Northward is true, Mr. Howe will scarcely venture upon Winter Quarters in Philadelphia.  We are waiting, for News, from Rhode Island.  I am wearied with the Life I lead, and long for the Joys of my Family. God grant I may enjoy it, in Peace. Peace is my dear Delight. War has no Charms for me. If I live much longer in Banishment I shall scarcely know my own Children.  Tell my little ones, that if they will be very good, Pappa will come home.  ""

  Dear Sir [25 October 1777] (1) I wrote you about ten days ago that General Gates had obtain'd a Signal Victory over General Burgoyne on the 7th. Inst. & now have the pleasure of informing you that a few days after this defeat Burgoyne with his whole Army Surrend'd themselves prisoners of War to the American General. It is said the prisoners Stores &c. taken are as followeth Viz 1 Lt. General, 2 Major Generals, 7 Brigadier Do. 5000 privates, 2 English noblemen, 1 Irish Do. 15,000 Stand of Arms 40 Brass Cannon and a Considerable Quantity of Cloathing. This great and Important News I transmit to you on the Authority of the Committee of Albany, Governor Clinton, and General Washington's Letters to Congress (except the Enumeration of Officers &c. which we have from another Quarter). No one doubts the truth of this happy Event Yet many feel the greatest Anxiety for a Confirmation of it under General Gates's own hand. Almost every day brings us News of some Advantage or other over the Enemy. Yesterday We received an account that General Howe had Abandon'd German Town & collected his whole force in Philadelphia & its Subberbs & that General Washingtons head Quarters was between German Town & the City. To day Major Clark Aid de Camp to General Green writes General Roberdeau that on the 22nd at 4 in the afternoon the Enemy made Several Attacks on Fort Mifflin, but were as often repuls'd. The Cannonade was very Severe & Continued till eight in the Evening. The next Morning it was renew'd with Redoubled Vigour. Two large Ships endeavour'd to pass the Chevaux de Freze while a Brisk fire was kept up from Province Island. At the same time a party of 3000 Attack'd Red Bank so that a Continual Fire was kept on all sides which lasted from 6 in the Morning till 4 in the afternoon without the least Intermission at which time the Enemy Quitted the Ships, haveing first set them on fire, & they soon after blew up. The explosion was dreadful. Thus ended the Day. Every thing seems quiet this Morning (the 24 being the Date of his Letter). He believes this will be their last effort & that they will certainly quit Philadelphia. He was inform'd one of the Ships was call'd the Augusta & that 300 Hessians were drown'd. Could you have thought these Forts and Batteries were so formidable? As this is Saturday evening and of course Holliday with Congress (2)haveing heard you several times mention Mr. Dechsay with Approbation I will give you the Conclusion of a Severe Libel against Congress & the Army Address'd by him to General Washington. After Attempting to refute the Idea of foreign Assistance or a European War, Magnifying the power & Clemency of Great Britain, Reprobateing his own Conduct for the part he took Early in the Dispute-he very Modestly Advises the General to demand of Congress  OCTOBER 25, 1777  an Immediate Negotiation with Lord & General Howe and if they refuse a ready Compliance to disavow their Authority, give up the Seditious Members as proper Sacrifices to Government and treat for America in his own person at the Head of his Army. What think you of this Invidious Hyprocrite now? On viewing what I have wrote You may infer this was a publick Address. No such thing, it was Couched in a Letter to the General in which he makes the warmest professions of Esteem & friendship & sent by a secret Emissary. I should have been more Minute if I was not certain you would see a Copy of the whole Letter in Virginia as the names of one or two of our Countrymen are mention'd with high Encomiums-(3) & you know they have friends here who would not wish to See Mr. Dechsay's panygerick on them Conceal'd from the Eyes of the publick. I hope we shall get through Confederation time enough for our Assembly to take it up this Session as the Attention of Congress is principally Confin'd to this Object. I fear the Length of my Letters will exhaust your patience but as you know my Motive is to give you the fullest & Earliest Intelligence of Matters highly Interesting you'l require no Apolegy for prolixity. What am I to do with your Money for Colo. Spotswood as I understand he has return'd to Virginia? Be Kind enough to inform Mr. Wythe that Doctr. Redman is in Philadelphia & that it is a Rule with Congress for no Seal'd Letter to go into the City.

  Dear General, York 25th October 1777 Permit me to refer to my late Letter of the 20th by Durst an Express. I have notified Mr. Hancock of the present Safe conveyance & again requested the honour of transmitting his Letter with your Commission.(1) Depend upon it I will Send them to you in time if possible, was his reply-granting the possibility & you will find his packet in Company with this, but the embarrassment which no doubt he feels from a variety of business in the moment of his leaving Congress, will probably prove an impediment.  By a New hand from the Northern department we have a Scrap OCTOBER 25, 1777  of the detail of General Burgoyne's Surrender which you will See on a peice of paper within but no Authentic Letter from General Gates has yet appeared, whence Some people begin to doubt the truth of the Accounts transmitted by General Putnam & General Geo Clinton -announced also in public Orders & the firing 13 Cannon by General Washington.  According to Mr. Gates's custom I say his advice cannot come to hand till this Evening or to morrow & in the mean time I will not be bilked of the pleasure of beleiving a Story so well told & so often repeated.  The Delaware affair which you will find upon another peice is Glorious. Don't you think those Cannoniering Heroes Commodore Hazelwood of the little Fleet, Colonel Smith at Fort Mifflin & Colonel Green, of Rhode Island, at Red Bank, deserve to be Canonized? Colo. Bradford formerly a printer in Philadelphia has had a great Share of merit in this noble perseverance. General Washington threw into the Fort a few days before the grand Action 2 or 3 hundred Stout fellows volunteers who had been accustomed to Fire & Water. Is not the Knight of the Bath verging fast toward a Shameful retreat or a more Shameful surrender, I don't think the latter impossible, his withdrawing from the Field into Philadelphia & fortifying demonstrates he had not sufficient Numbers for attack. The large detachments which were made upon the late occasion has rendered him less capable of defence. Be that as it may if we continue as now in all probability we shall, Masters of the River, he will in a few days have nothing to eat. The Game our General is playing I hope is the best & you Shall know it in due time. Some things have happened which have induced me to Send Duche's Letter to the president where if tis worth your trouble you may read a System of Hattery & tampering Rascality becoming the piety & honesty of a wretched Duche or Dodd. I have not been able to obtain a Copy of his prayer. I am well assured however by a Gentleman of a good memory & more viracity that when he affected to pray, among other equally Strong terms he constantly offered these. Bless our General & our Army, Shield & give them victory in the day of Battle-make them Instruments in the establishment of Liberty & Independency-teach our hands to War & our fingers to fight-Subdue our Enemies, let their Weapons in Battle fall from their unnerved Arms &c. &c. Alas! the fraility of human nature. In this view I pitied Dodd & I commiserate the abject State of Duche!  The more I reflect upon the Contents of the Letter particularly upon the truth calculated to deceive \""I write not under the Eye,\"" the Stronger is conviction that Lord & General Howe are in a State which renders Treaty a desireable object shackled at the Same time by Orders which will not admit of an approach from their Side, if such were their circumstances on the 8th October how galling are their fetters now at the 25.   General I will not Insult you by advice to be prepared guarded in the district committed to your Charge. I know your vigilance- tis time to releive you. My Dear Sir I wish you all happiness.  ""

  Dear Sir: York, Penn. 25 Octo. 1777.  The slow but sure moving Gates has not yet sent us his glorious Inventory. However, the intelligence of Burgoyne's surrender comes to us through such good channels that we do not doubt its truth, but impute Genl. Gates' silence to his necessary attention to the great business of disposing properly of so many prisoners &c., &c. I lately wrote Mr. Page (1) that the enemy had quitted Philadelphia. This came to us from the D. Quartermaster General, Col. Lutterlock, but it seems the motion of the enemies army was only from German Town, within their lines that cross the Common of Philadelphia from Delaware to Schuylkill. The body that crossed Schuylkill when Howe was supposed to be retreating was 1,500 as convoy to 150 Waggons sent to Chester for provisions. The narrowing their lines, and sending for provisions, evidences a design to keep Philadelphia if they can. But how they can, the inclosed letter from an Aid of Gen. Green will best satisfy you,(2) for if they cannot get their ships up, it is not possible for them to remain at Philadelphia I am just now well informed that Gen. Washington intended to move his army to the Chester side of Schuylkill, in order to cut off the enemies' intercourse with their Ships, and the better to aid the Fort on Delaware. That a Strong body of Militia will be left above German Town to prevent evil disposed persons from sending provisions to the enemy. I hope Burgoyne's surrender will be followed by that of Howe.  I am dear Sir affectionately yours, Richard Henry Lee  [P.S.] We have detained the Express from Col. Mason (3) to carry the authentic news about Burgoyne.

A Selfish, oppressive Spirit, a thirst after money & preferment, pleasure & Vanity, amazingly prevails & God is not in all our Thoughts. This is black & dark, but Gods Mercy is boundless & infinite, & endures forever, & tho we deserve & can expect nothing for our own Sakes, yet our God remembers Mercy for thousands of Generations of them that Love & fear Him, doubtless our forefathers were of that happy number, & I hope & trust He will not forsake Us, their degenerate Children, but will work for his own Name Sake.  Octo 25 Notwithstanding our unworthiness We have had great Success at the northward, blessed be God, & there is reason to hope How will not hold his Possession. The last news is, contrary to reasonable Expectation, that our Forts & Ships yet hold the river, & have destroyed, or caused to be destroyed two Ships of about 60 Gun each, as I have wrote my Bror Docr,(2) & that How is distressed for Wood, Houses &c, pays 20 pounds a Cord &c & indeed it is not much better here as to things in general.

I have seized a Moment, to congratulate you on the great and glorious Success of our Arms at the Northward, and in Delaware River. The Forts at Province Island and Red Bank have been defended, with a Magnanimity, which will give our Country a Reputation in Europe.  Coll.

This comes confirmed this Evening, in Letters from Gen. Washington inclosing Original Letters from Officers in the Forts.(1)  Congress will appoint a Thanksgiving, and one Cause of it ought to be that the Glory of turning the Tide of Arms, is not immediately due to the Commander in Chief, nor to southern Troops.

(dated Head Quarters J Morris's Octo 24th 1777 5 oClock P.M.) to General Mifflin, who is indisposed at Redden, which the General has sent to Congress, We have the following Intelligence.  \""The Day before Yesterday at 4 o Clock P.M. Count Donop with 1200 Hessian Granadiers made their Appearance before the Garrison at Red Bank,(1) & by Flag demanded a Surrender; which being refused they made an immediate Attack, forced the Abbatis, crossed the Ditch & some few had mounted the pickets.

  Gentlemen York October 26th 1777 Your several letters of the 3d & 9th of September and of October 11th have come to hand, but the removal of Congress & the necessary attendance to other very important matters has hitherto prevented an attention to them. You are doubtless to have a general superintendance over the Agents for building the Continental Ships, as well as to furnish them with such articles as you shall judge Necessary, but as they were constituted Agents before your appointment, they are to continue their more immediate attention to that business. We enclose you a resolution of Congress empowering any two of your Board to act in the absence of the third; (1) but it is the expectation that this will happen as seldom as possible. Enclosed you also have two Warrants One upon the Loan Office of Massachusets Bay for 50,000 Dollars, and the other for the like sum upon the Loan office of Rhode Island. You are sensible of the great call for money from every quarter. The drafts upon these Loan offices have lately been large as well as upon every other.  Should there not be money sufficient for the immediate payment of the whole of these sums, yet we apprehend the whole will not immediately be wanted, and you'l draw only as you want, that other drafts may stand an equal chance, where the monies are as much or more wanted-doubtless you'l be able to satisfy some demands with the loan office Certificates which these Warrants will enable you to procure, and which we recommend always to be attended to when it can be done. We also inclose you a resolution of Congress making an additional allowance to your Clerk and giving you power to appoint another if absolutely necessary. The Navy Board however in this Department has but one. You will have inclosed a List of the several Ships names and their Commander and we have directed the Navy Board of this Department now sitting at Bordentown to send you a number of the printed resolutions of Congress. The getting the ships out of Providence River and the Ship Trumbull out of Connecticut River is a matter of great importance, and what Congress has much at heart; the procuring this with the hazard that may attend it, may be left to your prudence and the good conduct of their Commanders. We are sorry to find that a disaffection subsists between Captain McNeill and his Officers & Seamen. This Ship must be got to sea at all events. Captain McNeill writes us that he expects to be able to man her notwithstanding the obstructions and dificulties he meets with. But if you find he is unable to do this, you must appoint some other Commander to the Ship at least for the present Cruize in whom you can confide, and Captain McNeill must be otherwise provided for, more especially as an enquiry must be had (if not a Court Martial) upon the Conduct of the late Cruize, with Captain Manly, but which OCTOBER 26, 1777  its apprehended cannot be fairly done till captain Manly is exchanged.(2) Captain McNeill seems to think such a measure necessary. We think in justice to his Character, as well as to the public good, it is [so?]. You have inclosed a Resolution empowering you to suspend any Officer till the pleasure of Congress shall be known.(3) This power we doubt not will be exercised with proper prudence. By the words commander in Chief must since the suspension of Commodore Hopkins necessarily mean and intend the oldest Commander in Rank of the Continental Ships or Vessels of war in any One Port or Harbor. Or when Court Martials are necessary, the oldest Commander within your district that can be applied to. The procuring Iron & Flour we must leave to be done when absolutely necessary, by such means as would think prudent and proper under a like necessity acting for yourselves. Lead is not to be obtained here, but orders are sending to the Eastward for that article for the Army. We hear a very considerable quantity has lately arrived there, we think at Bedford, perhaps the whole may not be taken up. We have no immediate employ for Captain Tucker, but shall attend to the appointment of Commanders for the Ships building at Salsbury and Norwich. In the mean time you'l please to transmit us the names of such persons within your district as you can recommend for Captains and officers of them, paying attention to such as are at present in Commission but out of actual Service, informing us at the same time of their particular Merits and pretentions. Captain McNeill has already Instructions where his Ship is to proceed viz to France. A form of like Instructions is herewith enclosed, to be by you given to each of the Commanders of the Ships at Providence. We are Gentlemen, Your hble Servants  P.S.

  Octo 26 [1777]. Sab. Eveng. Brown is detained by the President to wait on Him, as He is now in earnest returning home. This day Week We received Copy of the Albany Comtees Letter, giving an Acco of Burgoyne & whole Armys surrendering Prisoners of War, it gaind intire Credit, to the great Joy of Congress & the Friends of their Country, but scarce a Circumstance of Confirmation, from [that time?] till this, so that it was almost [. . .] believed, nor has Genl Gates [. . .](1) but we hear a Col Wilkinson [. . .] with Dispatches from Him & the News seems confirmed past Contradiction. You have had it without doubt more perfectly. What infinite reason have We to bless & extol the name of the Lord of Hosts the God of Armys, for this great reverse of our Affairs in that quarter, since proud Burgoyne was able to say (at the shameful evacuation of Ty. &c) Veni, Vidi, Vici, which has been overruled for great Good, tho We then tho't with good old Jacob, all these things are against Us. O, may the Mercies & Judgments of the Almighty, accomplish the great Design for which They are sent, our Repentance & Reformation.  I doubt not Congress will appoint a Day of Thansgiving on this great Occasion, thro out the Continent, & may God give Us Heart to celebrate it in a right & acceptable manner.

  Dear Sir York Town 27th Octob. 1777 We are yet in possession of the River Delaware, Fort Mifflin & the Fort oposite to it at Red Bank. The Enemy have made repeated attacks upon the Forts in the course of the last week but were always repulsed with great loss particularly the general attack which they made on the 22 & 23d Instant when they lost two Ships the Augusta of 64 Guns & the Liverpool of 28 both which they had warped through the lower row of Chevaux de frize but not being able to sustain the heavy fire from our Forts were forced to abandon them & blow them up.

  Sir, Manheim Octobr. 27th. 1777 It is now a Week since I received your favour of the 29th Septr.(1) continued to the first Inst on the road from York Town to this place where my Family now reside. I then desired Mr. Coleman to continue his Journey to York & gave him back the Letters requesting he would deliver them to Mr. Hancock with my Compts. & that I desired he would read them to Congress in order that they might be prepared against my return when I should bring this Matter before them in form as a piece of business, Accordingly I returned to York last Week but found Congress so closely pursuing business of Importance that I did not think it right to interrupt it & as Mr. Coleman seems impatient at the Delay I have concluded to dispatch him with my own Sentiments relative to the Portugueeze Snow & trust to some other conveyance to hand you any determinations of Congress relative to that affair. I can not help thinking that Captn. Cunninghame's conduct in seizing this Snow if she is really & truly Portugueeze property is extemely reprehensible for I do not believe that Mr. OCTOBER 27, 1777  Braxton cou'd or wou'd give him orders to capture such property at a time when no Resolves of Congress authorized it but even if he has such orders, those who gave them are much to blame & I do suppose the Transaction will appear in this light to all the World.(2) However as the Vessell & Cargo are sent in I suppose there must be a Tryal in the Admiralty Court because the Crew of the Privateer wou'd not be content that the Owners shou'd dismiss her without Trial neither have they a right or Authority to do so that I know off. I hope however for the sake of Justice & for the Honour of the United States of America that a righteous Judgement may be pronounced on her, & that she will not be condemned as prize unless upon the Trial Circumstances turn up to prove her Justly, fairly, & equitably within the True Intent & Meaning of those Laws of Congress which describe what shall be deemed Lawfull Prize. I should be truly sorry if any hard strained Constrictions or political distinctions and considerations should procure a Condemnation, & to prove to you Sir how much I am in earnest I do solemnly declare that I will not as a part Owner receive any part of or benefit from this Capture unless circumstances turn up to prove her what I have said above. I do not expect it will be the case but suppose she will be acquitted & ordered to be restored the former Owners & shall propose to Congress that they should interfere in the business & if that happens the Captn. of the Snow & some of his People being sent away she can not be restored to him & shou'd the Owners of the Phoenix be ordered to restore her they must run great risque in Attempting to do it for I apprehend they should put an American Master onboard & send her to Tryall with proper certificates from the Admiralty Court the Commander of British Cruizers woud pay no regard to such proceedings. They woud consider her as a Prize under the Act of Parliament & as such woud proceed against & condemn her. The Owners of the Phoenix would then be exposed to future Lawsuits & damages by the prosecution of the Portugueeze Owners-should the Owners of the Phoenix proceed to sell Vessell & Cargo for Account of the former Owners where shall the property center untill they can remit it to Portugal? It must not be divided amongst them & with whom shall they trust it so that all may be satisfied, I know not. My design is therefore to propose that Congress shall order Vessell & Cargo to be sold & the proceeds be vested in the Publick Funds bearing Interest for the Benefit of the Proprietors, that our Commissioners at the Court of France inform the Court of Portugal of this Transaction & grant Passports to the Owners of this Snow to send one or more Vessells to any Port or Ports in these United States with Publick Assurance that the Net Proceeds will be immediately paid to them or their Atty. or Agent & that leave will be granted to purchase therewith such produse of this Country as they chuse & leave to carry it away in their Vessells. This will put it in the Owners power to make good Fortune out of lead. They will   have their property restored in a Way that will amply recompence any disappointments they have experienced by the seizure of it & if the Court of Portugal procure Passports from Britain they will do this with perfect security. This idea I have communicated to some of my Colleagues in Congress & it meets the Approbation of all I have mentioned it to, under [this] Idea then I give you my opinion that the Vessell & Cargo shou'd be tryed by the Admiralty Court if she is there condemned I have nothing further to say (only to judge for myself here after whether she is a prize that I can with a safe conscience benefit from or not) but if she is Acquitted & ordered to be restored to the former Owners, that you shoud then cause her to be taken good care of, either by authority of the State, of the Court, or of your own authority as Agent for the Owners which ever may be judged most proper & no Plunder or Embezzlement take place but inform me instantly by Express or otherways of the Acquittal I will instantly bring the Matter to a determination & transmit you back their resolutions with full Orders for what is then to be done. I have no opportunity of consulting Mr. Braxton or any other Owners of the Phoenix respecting this business therefore I do not presume to give any Directions for your proceedings in case of Condemnation my whole care is to guard them from any III Consequences that might arise to them from Injustice or III Management in case of Acquittal & to preserve to the former Owners their property with a Secure Mode of recovering it in all which I presume I shall have the Approbation of all good Men. I am expecting from you a Translation of the Papers found onboard the Snow & remain, Sir, Your Obedt. hble Servt. Robt Morris  ""

  My dearest Friend York Town, Octr. 28. 1777  We have been three days, soaking and poaching in the heavyest Rain, that has been known for several Years, and what adds to the Gloom is the Uncertainty in which We remain to this Moment, concerning the Fate of Gates and Burgoigne. We are out of Patience. It is impossible to bear this suspence, with any Temper.  I am in comfortable Lodgings, which is a Felicity that has fallen to the Lott of a very few of our Members. Yet the House where I am is so thronged, that I cannot enjoy such Accommodations as I wish. I cannot have a Room as I used, and therefore cannot find Opportunities to write as I once did.  The People of this Country, are chiefly Germans, who have Schools in their own Language, as well as Prayers, Psalms and Sermons, so that Multitudes are born, grow up and die here, without ever learning the English. In Politicks they are a breed of Mongrels or Neutrals, and benumbed with a general Torpor.  If the People, in Pensylvania, Maryland, Delaware and Jersy had the Feelings and the Spirit of some People that I know, Howe would be soon ensnared in a Trap, more fatal than that in which, as it is said, Burgoigne was taken.  Howe is compleatly in our Power, and if he is not totally ruined it will be entirely owning to the Aukwardness and indolence of this Country.  Fighting however, begins to become fashionable. Coll. Green has exhibited a glorious Example, in the Defence of Red bank. But this must be done by a New Englandman at the Head of two N. England Regiments, Rhode Islanders.  Coll. Smith however, is a Marylander, from Baltimore. He has shewn another Example of Magnanimity, which gives me the most agreable Hopes. Commodore Hazelwood too, has behaved in a manner that exceeds all Praise. This Spirit will be caught by other Officers, for Bravery is epidemical and contagious as the Plague.  This Army suffers much for Want of Blanketts and Shoes.  I celebrated the 25th of this Month, in my own Mind and Heart, much more than I shall the 30th-because I think the first a more fortunate day than the last.(1)  My Duty to your Father and my Mother-to Unkles and Aunts. Love to Brothers and sisters-but above all, present all the affection that Words can express to our dear Babes.  ""

  My dear sir York Town in Pennsylvania Octr. 28. 1777 Since my last of the 6th Instant, I am favoured with yours of Sepr 8th, & havg previously wrote to You on the Subject thereof, hope You have e'er this recd my Letter, together with the Orders & Remittance which the Commercial Committee were directed to transmit to You.  The Remarkable Success of our arms in the North, calls for our immediate & most grateful Acknowledgmts to the Sovereign Dispenser of every Event, & if properly improved, may speedily terminate in the Quietus or Removal of those Instruments of Tyranny wsh. now infest the western World. Advices were yesterday received by Congress, from our Gallies & Forts in & upon the River Delaware, which must give You Pleasure. On the 21st Inst. the Enemy crossed at Cooper's Ferry (in Philadelphia) with 1200 Germans under the Command of Count Dunop, & marched thro a small Part of the Jersies to red Bank, a Post of ours on the Banks of the Delaware. They arrived within 1/4 of a Mile of the Fort the 22d at 12 oClock At Noon, & at 1 sent a Flag to demand a Surrender. Colo Green (of Rhode Island) who was ordered there by General Washington, with part of his Batalion, & had the Command, refused to Surrender; & We are informed, that in Order to induce the Enemy to an Escalade, he secreted from the Officer who came with the Flag, all his Men excepting fifty, & informed him, \""that With those brave Fellers he intended to make the Fort his Tomb.\"" The Enemy immediately began a brisk Cannonade, & at 3/4 after 4 marched in two Columns to storm it, but after passing the Abatis, & gaining the Ditch they were so warmly received as to be obliged to a precipitate Retreat, leaving behind Count Dunop & his Brigade Major, both Wounded, 78 killed, & 70 Wounded prisoners, amongst the former of which was a Leiutenant Colonel, & several other officers. 300 Arms were found near the Fort, part of which it is supposed were left by such of the Wounded as escaped, who according to the Number of killed, must have been equall to all the killed & wounded left in the Field. The Enemy We are informed did not recover their Fright untill they had recrossed the Ferry & joyned their main Army. In the morning of the 23d three bomb Bataries were opened at Day break on Fort Mifflin, & 6 Ships of War having the preceding Night warped thro the lower Chiveaux de Frize, were brot against the Fort abt 7 in the Morning. The Cannonade was kept up on both Sides very warmly, untill 12 at Noon, when it was found convenient by the Enemy to remove their Ships, in doing wch. they were so well served by the Gallies that one of their 60 Gun Ships & 20 Gun Frigates were run on Shore & afterwards burnt by their own people, who were obliged to quit them. Those that escaped were ordered down the River, & by the last advices the Garrisons were unmolested & in high Spirits. Thus may I congratulate You OCTOBER 28, 1777  on some happy events of the South which 'tho small when compared with those from the other Quarters will serve to increase the Reputation of the Arms of the United States.  I am in Hopes that You will receive the plan of Confederacy before the first of December, as Congress are very industrious in compleating it. A Report is now before Congress for a large continental Tax, confiscating & making Sale of tory Estates & appropriating the same to support the War, but for the Benefit of the respective States, & for sinking all the Currency of the several States.(1) Nothing new from abroad. Congress have lately made a Major General of the Baron de Kalb, who is said to be an exceeding good officer. I hope that the Assembly will vigorously carry into Execution the Plan lately recommended for recruiting the Army & apprehending Deserters; & that the Shoes, Hose & Blankets required will be sent with the utmost Expedition to General Washington's army, which is in great Want thereof. Not a Line from General Gates relative to the Captivity of General Burgoyne & his Army, wch gives Reason to conclude that the Express is intercepted. I remain sir in great Haste Yours Sincerely,  E Gerry P.S. Pray order a sufficient Number of Charged Bombs, & battering Cannon to be in Readiness for attacking New York; as I presume this cannot be omitted, & these Articles may be wanted.  Octr 29th. I have just recd your Favour of Octr 5th,(2) the Letter wch. You wrote relative to the Wants of the Navy came to Hand but a few Days since, altho dated the 8th Sepr.; but I hope that You will soon have fresh Supplies of Cloathing &c for the United States, & be able to obtain what is wanted for the Navy. The Army nevertheless must be first supplyed. The paragraph relative to the \""remarkable Success\"" which I mentioned in the Beginning of the Letter, was grounded on Information recd from Governor Clinton that General Burgoyne & his whole army had surrendered to General Gates. He recd it from the Chairman or President of the N York Convention & sent to Congress a Copy of a Letter from the Chairman of the Committee of Albany to the president aforesaid; wch put the Matter so far beyond Doubt, that it was universally beleived to be true, but it is now 10 Days since the Advices first came, & no Confirmation of it from General Gates, which induces us to beleive, that it was a Deception in order to prevent Genl Clinton from attempting to Joyn G. Burgoyne, in Consequence of this Intelligence, the proposition was made for providing Bombs Cannonade, which had it been true might have been wanted soon.  The Loss of the Enemy at German Town has not been yet ascertained. General Agnew was killed & a Number of other officers of Distinction & all the Hospitals in the City taken up for the Wounded. This We have from a Lady who left the City after the Battle who is   to be depended on, & by the best information to be had the Number of their killed & wounded is abt 1500. We daily expect to hear important advices from the northern & eastern Departnts., & hope they will be favourable.  ""

  Dear Sir, York in Pennsylva. Octr. 28. 1777 The anxiety at Williamsburg cannot be greater than it is here to have a particular account of our late glorious success in the North. For nine days past, we have hourly expected the arrival of a Messenger with Gates's Magnificent Inventory, and in order to a quick transmission of it, we have detained, and still keep Colo. Masons Express. We now learn that Colo. Wilkinson D. Adjutant Gen. is on his way with this long wisht for Capitulation by which Gen. Burgoyne and his Army have surrendered themselves prisoners of war. Until I can furnish you the authentic detail, I will entertain you with the relation of our late success on the Delaware below Philadelphia. It must be obvious to you how important to the enemy it is, that they shd. get their fleet up to the City, for this purpose they have made many efforts which have been repulsed with considerable injury to their Ships, and loss of Men. The last attempt was the most powerful and was as follows-With 1200 Hessian Grenadiers led by Colo. Count Donop they attack'd Red Bank, a post held by a party of Troops under Colo. Green of Rhode Island, nearly opposite to Fort Island on the Jersey Shore. The attack was made by Storm, and they had passed the Abbatis, gained the Ditch, and some of them, with Donop & his Aid Major at their head, had passed the Pickets, when they met so warm a reception as to be driven back and forced to retire with great precipitation, leaving the Count and his Aid with 70 wounded in our hands, and upwards of 70 dead on the spot. 300 muskets with swords &c. &c. are taken, one Lieut. Colo. & some inferior Officers of the enemy are among the slain. The routed party returned to Philadelphia, crossing Delaware opposite the City. An attack was likewise made on Fort Mifflin by several Ships of War and by the Batteries on Province Island, which was continued long and with great violence. At length the Ships retired and two of them getting a ground (a 64 & OCTOBER 28, 1777  a 20) were quitted by the people after having set fire to them. They blew up with a terrible explosion. Thus the enemy were defeated and disappointed in this general attack. Whether they will renew their attempts I cannot tell, but it is probable they will. That you may have a better idea of this important passage I have inclosed you a draught made by Capt. Loyeaute of Gen. Coudrays Corps of Artillerists, the same Gentleman whom we have recommended for the Command of our Batn. of Artillery.(1) He is an Artist in the business of Artillery and not unacquainted with the art of the Engineer, and will most assuredly benefit our Country much in this necessary department. I pray you Sir to interest yourself in procuring the appointment of this Gentleman. At all events it is proper that an answer be speedily sent here that the Gentleman may not be unnecessarily delayed. There has been pains taken to get this Officer in other States, but we have prevailed with him to give Virginia the preferance. The United States have a very considerable quantity of field Artillery at present, 30 pieces of which are laying idle at Charles Town in S. Carolina. Suppose Virginia was to direct their Delegates to apply to Congress for 6 or 8 of these pieces (2) & if they are granted to us, let them be brought to our Country, where for the present they may serve to instruct the Men with, and be ready for use next Campaign if we should be visited, which I very much incline to think will be the case, since the enemy have been so baffled in the North as must, I think, discourage future efforts in that quarter. Capt. Loyeaute is of opinion that it would be quite proper to have that number of Field pieces at the least, for the purpose of instruction, as well as for use in war. There are so many places in our Country that require to be fortified, and the use of Artillery is become so very important in war, that I think we cannot be too well and too soon acquainted with this branch of the Art of War. These Officers of Gen Coudrays Corps have only leave of absence from the Court of France for 2 years, and I think it will be very unwise in America not to profit from this circumstance so as to acquire knowledge of a necessary Art which they understand so well, and which we are quite ignorant of. Monsr. Loyeaute speaks English pretty well, and improves daily.(3)The impatience of the Express will not suffer him to remain here any longer, and therefore we are not able to confirm the Northern News. This is the first moment of fair weather since Sunday morning, it having been constant and heavy rain for 4 days and nights past, which has prevented all intercourse with the Army or from the North. We shall send an Express to you immediately on receiving an authentic account from Gen. Gates, which I hope will be the case in a short time.  I am dear Sir most affectionately yours, Richard Henry Lee.  Octr. 30th. 1777. 10 oClock in the morning.  OCTOBER 29, 1777  ""

  My dear sir York Town Pennsylva Oct. 29 1777 I sent you a few days ago an Account of the Success we have had on the Delaware. The Honor of recovering Philadelphia seems to be intended for the brave Men who command there; for if the Enemy cannot get up with their Ships of War, Howe cannot long remain in the City. May Honor be given to whom Honor may be due.  Congress have applyd with Diligence to Confederation. Most of the important Articles are agreed to. Each State retains its Sovereignty and Independence with every Power, Jurisdiction and Right which is not by the Confederation expressly delegated to the United States in Congress assembled.  Each State is to have one Vote in Congress; but there must be a Concurrence of Nine States in all Matters of Importance.  The Proportion of the publick Expence to be paid by Each State to be ascertained by the Value of all the Lands granted to or surveyd for any Person, to be estimated according to such Mode as Congress shall from time to time direct.  All Disputes about Boundaries are to be decided by Judges appointed in the following Mode: The Representatives of Each State in Congress to be nominated, the contending States to strike off 13 Each and out of the remaining 13 not more than 9 nor less than 7 shall be drawn out by Lot, any five of them to hear & determine the Matter.  I hope we shall finish the Confederation in a few days when I intend to renew my Request for the Leave of Absence, and return home.(1) I am determined by Cods Assistance never to forsake the great Cause in which my Country is virtuously struggling; but there are others who have greater Abilities & more adequate to this important Service, than I have. I hope therefore another will be appointed in my Room. It is the greatest Honor of my Life to have enjoyd the Confidence of my Country thus long; and I have the clear and full Testimony of my own Mind that I have at all Times endeavord to fill the Station they have thought fit to place me in to their Advantage.  This will be deliverd to you by Mr. Hancock who has Leave of Absence till the first of January next.(2)  I hope the Person to be elected in my Room will have understand- OCTOBER 29, 1777  ing enough to know when the Arts of Flattery are playd upon him, and Fortitude of mind sufficient to resist & despise them. This I mention inter Nosmetipsos. In this evil World there are oftentimes large Doses prepared for those whose Stomacks will bear them. And it would be a disgrace to human Nature to affirm there are some who can take the fullest Cup without nauseating.  I suppose you have by this time finishd a form of Government. I hope the greatest Care will be taken in the Choice of a Governor. He, whether a wise Man or a Fool, will in a great Measure form the Morals & Manners of the People. I beg Pardon for hinting the Possibility of one of the last Character being chosen; But alas! Is there not such a Possibility! But I assure my self of better things. I believe my Country will fix their Eyes and their Choice on a Man of Religion and Piety; who will understand human Nature and the Nature and End of political Society-who will not by Corruption or Flattery be seducd to the betraying, even without being sensible of it himself, the sacred Rights of his Country.  We are told that the Prisoners taken at the Northward are sent into Massachusetts Bay. I hope Burgoyn will not be permitted to reside in Boston; for if he is, I fear that inconsiderate Persons of Fashion and some significance will be inducd, under the Idea of Politeness, to form Connexions with him, dangerous to the Publick. There are other Reasons which I should think would make his or any other officers being fixed in a populous Town uneligible. There are Prison ships I suppose provided for the Privates.  The Success of the present Campain hitherto has been great beyond our most sanguine Expectation. Let us ascribe Glory to God who has graciously vouchsafd to favor the Cause of America and of Mankind. We are impatiently waiting to hear from Rhode Island. Should we succeed in every Quarter, yet we must not slack our Hands. Every Nerve must be exerted in preparing for another Campain; for we may be attackd the next Spring with redoubled Vigor.  There is Nothing in my opinion so threatning to us as our depreciating Currency. Among the Train of Evils it is likely to bring upon us, is the Destruction of Morals; for many will be ready to think Extortion and Injustice necessary and justifiable for their own Security. I am much pleasd to hear that the People of our State are loudly calling for & the Assembly is about to lay on a heavy Tax. This, if punctually collected, will be an effectual Remedy. I hope the Payment of the Interest on Money borrowd, in Bills on France, will bring large Sums into our Loan offices. But I am come to a Necessity of concluding. Adieu my dear Friend. S A  ""

  My dear sir York Town in Pennsylvania Octr 29. 1777 Soon after the Receipt of your agreable Favour of April 12th, (1) I was under the Necessity of suspending a Correspondence with all my Friends, which I think would not have been the Case, had my Situation been on the Banks of a River, blessed with the finest of Air, & abounding with the most delicate Species of the finny Creation.(2) This Part of my Epistle I think you will be able to decypher without an Alphabet.  I am informed that You was a warm advocate for the regulating Act, & had I been honored with a Seat in your House, You would certainly have had an Addition of one to your Sect. True it is, that an Excess of Money whether in Specie or Bills of Credit, will lessen the comparative Value, & that this will appear by enhanced prices, but is equally true, that while the Spirit of Commerce exists in a State, it will be found expedient if not indispensibly necessary, to limit the prices of those Articles of Trade which are considered as Necessaries of Life, when a great & lasting Scarcity takes Place; notwithstanding the quantity of Money should not exceed, or be even equal to, the Sum required in the State, for a circulating Medium. Therefore the Reduction of the Quantity, & restraining Acts must go hand in Hand, or the purpose in my humble Opinion, of supporting the Credit of the Currency, will never be answered. I have the Misfortune to be on the Committee upon the proceedings of your late Convention, & a Report is now before Congress for sinking the Currency of each State, taxing the Continent largely, & confiscating the Estates of fugitives, & others who have forfeited the Protection of the several States, for the Benefit of such States, but providing by Recommendation that such Estates should be sold & invested in Loan office Certificates of the Continent. The Committee will I hope in the next place propose a plan of general Regulation of prices from the Want of wch. your Act was before defeated.(3) I have long expected to have seen a Duty layed by your State for the Benefit thereof on prize Goods of at least 5 per Cent; It would give me pleasure to hear of it tomorrow; it is justifyed & encouraged by the Confederacy as adopted by Congress. The Late Resolve for paying Interest, will, I think, bring in large Sums to the Loan offices; the Encouragement is great & the Lender will be benefited in proportion to the Appreciation or Depreciation of the Currency.  As the president will deliver this, it is unnecessary to give a Detail of Congress Matters, wch You will receive from him by Whole sale. I congratulate You on the late Successes of our Troops in the North & the Delaware & remain with much Esteem Sr. yours sincerely,  E Gerry OCTOBER 29, 1777  P.S.

Yesterday Morning Mr. H. who had several times before given Notice to Congress of his Intention to return to Boston agreeable to Leave he had obtaind at Philadelphia, made a formal Speech to Congress in which he reminded them of his having served them as President more than two years; whether he had conducted to their Approbation or not, was left to them; but he had the Testimony of his own Mind that he had done it to the best of his Ability. He thanked them for the Civility they had shown him, and if in the Course of Business he had faild in due Respect to any Member, as it was not intentional, he hoped it would be overlookd. It is likely as I have taken it from Memory upon hearing it once read, that I have not done it Justice in point of Expression.

  Dr. Sr. York 30th Oct. 1777. Attacks were made the 22d inst. on Forts Mifflin and Redbank in both of which the Enemy were repulsed. A Batterie on Province Island and two upon the Bank opposite to Fort Mifflin thrown up to reclaim the great marsh below Province Island opened upon the Fort, and were supported by six Ships warped through the Cheveaux defriez at Billingsport. Our Gallies and armed Vessells in the River assisted the Fort, and in conjunction they kept up so effectual a Cannonade upon the Ships as to disable a 64 Gun Ship and Sloop of War, or Small Frigate, & the Enemy set them on fire before they quitted. One of the four that retired was the Roebuck greatly damaged. Baron Dunop with 1200 men Attacked Red Bank and after a short Cannonade marched up with fixed Bayonets in two Columns. They passed the cavelte, entered the ditch & some passed the picket, but were so warmly received, they fell back & fled, leaving Baron Donop, his Brigade Maj., a Capt. Lieut. & upwards 70 men wounded & prisoners-1 Lieut. Colonel, 3 Capts., 4 Lieut. & neer 70 killed, neer 300 musketts and a considerable number cartridge Boxes &c OCTOBER 30, 1777  taken.

  Honble Gentlemen. October 31, 1777 We have the pleasure to inclose you the capitulation by which Genl. Burgoyne and his Whole army surrendered themselves prison- OCTOBER 31, 1777  ers of War. This great event might have still been greater had not the operations on Hudson's river below Albany rendered it apprehensible that Sir Harry Clinton might come to the relief of Genl. Burgoyne as he had urged his way up to within forty four miles of Albany, at which place were lodged the principal Magazines of War and provisions for our Northern Army. Genl. Gates is now moving down the north river, having sent Genl. Stark with two thousand brave men to reduce Ticonderoga and the passes yet occupied by the Enemy on Lake George.  General Howe is yet at Philadelphia; but whether he will be able to continue there may be judged from a consideration of General Burgoyne's surrender-from the hitherto unavailing efforts of the enemy to get their Fleet up to the city from General Washington's- being with a good army now near Germantown, and closing upon the enemy's lines which run across the commons near Philadelphia, as we are informed from Delaware to Schuylkill after many smaller attempts had been made in vain upon Fort Island, and the Chevaux de Frize, a general and very powerful attack was made upon the 22d & 23d of this month on Red Bank by twelve hundred Hessians and on Fort Island by several Ships of war which approached as near as the Frize would admit, and by fire from Batteries erected on Province Island. The Hessians were led on by Count Donop, Colonel Commandant. They attempted the place by storm, and were repulsed with the loss of seventy dead on the spot, and seventy eight prisoners wounded. Among the latter are Colo. Donop and his AidMajor. Among the former are a Lt. Colo. and some inferior Officers. From the Ships and Province Island Batteries a furious cannonade was long continued and warmly returned by Fort Mifflin and the gallies. At length the ships were obliged to retire with the loss of two which the Enemy set on fire themselves, and which were thus blown up. These two are said to be the Augusta of 64 guns and the Liverpool Frigate. The names of the ships we cannot be sure of yet, but that two men of war were destroyed is certain; and being desirous of giving you the most early information of the great events at the northward, We shall be more particular about the Delaware business hereafter. We rely on your wisdom and care to make the best and most immediate use of this intelligence to depress our enemies and produce essential aid to our cause in Europe. The public acknowlgement of the Independence of these United States would be attended with beneficial consequences, and whilst we proceed with diligence and care to profit from our advantages, we are sensible how essential European Aid must be to the final establishment and security of American Freedom and Independence. We are in daily expectation of hearing from you which we have not done since May last. As some of our Frigates are ordered to France under your after directions, we hope to hear in due time, that more effectual  distress hath been conveyed to the Commerce of our enemies. It were pity that some of their towns should not be made to suffer for the licentious conflagrations which have been kindled by them in America.  We have the honor to be &c, Signed,  R. H. Lee J.

  Sir, York Town Oct. 31st 1777. We have the honor and the pleasure to enclose you a copy of the capitulations by which Gen. Burgoyne and his army surrendered themselves prisoners of war. This great affair might have been still greater, if the near approach of Sir Henry Clinton to Albany (where our military and provision stores were lodged,) had not rendered dispatch necessary with General Burgoyne's army. Two thousand brave men under Gen. Stark are gone to Ticonderoga, and Gen. Gates with the main body of his army is moving down the North River to meet Gen. Vaughn, who yet remains about fifty miles below Albany. Two Brigades with the light corps under Col. Morgan, are on their way to join Gen. Washington. Nothing that we know of hath happened near Philadelphia, since the enemies' unsuccessful attack on Red Bank and Fort Mifflin, in which two of their ships of war were lost, and Count Donop with some inferior officers and 70 privates made prisoners. A more particular account of which has been already sent to Williamsburg. We have thought it of importance enough to send a particular Express with this glorious intelligence, which we hope will be approved. As the Artillery Officer (Capt.

They were within a few days of Albany. General Burgoyne had twelve days Provision, and in Strong Ground well fortified, in such a situation the above was a most fortunate event for us.

I hope this will find you in health at or near town and that you will see Mr L____ or Doctr Gardner and relate some little anecdotes about the crest fallen Lt General John Burgoyne to them so that I may have them again at second hand. I have hinted to you before that your department was gaining honor, and that the Lords of the American Admiralty might hold up their heads. The enclosed will be quite agreeable to you as a confirmation of what I before only hinted. Nickolson thought he could get out of Chesapeake but now writes that 4 men of war infest that bay and make it dangerous to attempt a pass out. He is desirous to go with 100 of his men to Delaware to assist in fighting the gallies. I believe this will be granted.  Our late President has left us, and Col Laurens of South Carolina is chosen to succeed.

  Dr. Sir, Tyaquin Nov. 4th. 1777. I left York Town in Pennsylvania on the 1st ulto.(1) and arrived at home on the 26th. After our retreat from Philadelphia, I remained at Burlington a week in daily expectation of an action at the British Army's crossing the Schuykill. In this Expectation I was disappointed, the Enemy crossed and marched to Philadelphia without opposition. I have not yet heard, or been able to suggest a reason, which gives me sufficient satisfaction for that Event. Our Army was on their Flank, and why they crossed without an attack remains yet to be sufficiently explained to me. After the Enemy had got possession of the City, I set out and found myself obliged to direct my route by Eastown, Bethlehem, Reading and Lancaster, to York which constituted a very difficult Journey.  While I was at Reading, happened the Battle of Chesnut Hill, and Germantown, wherein we unfortunately lost Gen. Nash, one of the best, the most respected and regretted officers in the Continental Army. The particulars of this Battle Mr Harnett informed me he wrote you before my arrival at York and I will not trouble you with a repetition. Upon the whole it appears that our miscarriage sprung from the usual source, want of abilities in our Superior Officers, and want of order and discipline, in our Army. This Sir is an Evil of the  NOVEMBER 4, 1777  most dangerous tendency, and to remedy it has long been the object of my thoughts and endeavours. Indeed I saw very little prospect of success until very lately, but just before I left Congress I had the pleasure to find that every Gentleman was equally sensible of the necessity of applying a proper remedy. The great difficulty will be to get over particular Connections, and personal regards, but it must be effectually remedied or all our Efforts are in vain.  The miscarriages in Pennsylvania have made it necessary it seems, to order the Troops which defended the passes of the High Lands on the Hudson's River to be withdrawn to reinforce General Washington. General Clinton taking advantage of this has attacked and carried fort Montgomery, burned our Frigates in that River, and opened the communication between New York and Albany, except only some little ineffectual bits that remain. The Army under Genl Gates, as well as that under Genl Washington were situated so near the Enemy that little seemed to be done but to attack them. A Battle of considerable importance was every day expected to be fought by each army, and our force was so much Superior to that of the Enemy that we have every reason to hope for signal success. Nothing indeed can prevent it, but some of those unfortunate blunders which have lately been so frequent in our Army. Upon the whole Sir, I am in daily expectation of an account of signal victories gained over both armies of our Enemies, but I dare not promise it, having been of late so cruelly disappointed of my most sanguine and well founded expectations.  Very little of any consequence has been lately determined in Congress. The Confederation was the subject of daily consideration when I came away, but as I consider the plan now in embryo, as what can never be suited to the States, I think nothing decided on it, is of consequence. I fear I differ very widely on this subject with a majority in Congress. I deem a time of peace and tranquility, the proper time for agitating so important a concern, but some, and not aware of opinion that advantage should be taken of the present circumstances of the States which are supposed favorable for pressing them, to a very close Connexion, but more Sir of this when we meet.(2) My long absence from home has very much deranged my rustic affairs, and they require much of my own particular attention to restore them. This makes it exceedingly inconvenient to me to go to Newbern immediately. I will therefore beg to be excused for a week or two, but if my presence be required there I will set off immediately on your signifying your Commands, an opportunity for which will immediately offer by the messenger who will bring up a writ for an Election of a Commoner for this County to fill an occasional vacancy which has happened. I saw Capt Caswell at Brandywine on the field of Battle. I saw him next day at Chester, and since I have enquired for him, and heard he was well.

  Dear Sir(1) 4 Novr. 1777 York Town Smallwood was well known in our State. He had the Advantage of heading the first Maryland Troops. They were well trained, well oflicered, well cloathed, cut a fine Figure and did remarkable Service and were in early Times an Older Man too. NOVEMBER 4, 1777  Generals cannot be made so fast as they used to be. Maryland chose to have Generals of some Experience, surely it will be pretty well to become a Brigadier in a Couple of Campaigns, a whole Life Time does not attain to it scarcely in Europe.  Maryland is intitled to two Brigadiers more and a Major General. I apprehend Colo. Gist and Carvill will be the Men for Price is in no Estimation in the Army, they I suppose will be appointed this Winter if their gallant Actions merit it.(2)  I cannot think Carvill discontented, he was willing to accept of the 4th Battallion. He got the 3d you say; he has not yet served One Campaign in the regular Service. He has intimated no such Matter to You or myself.  All are new Faces in Congress, I cannot sound untill I contract some Acquaintance but the above was the Sense of the Maryld. Delegates with Respect to not proposing our Brigadiers too early and of Congress in granting them when asked for.  I have not seen Mr. Morris since the Receipt of yours. I shall write to Carvill when I see him. I inclose You the Terms of Burgoyne s Capitulation which he would have called a Convention. Our Army was composed of 7139 Rank and File fit to do Duty, 900 and odd on Command and above 1000 Officers somewhat exceeding 9000. Theirs 4991, above 1000 Officers and exceeding 6000, thirty five Peices of Cannon, Tents, Stores &c. Brigadier Stark with 2000 Voluntiers were within two Miles at the Time of Surrender, he has marched with them determined to take Ticonderoga & Mount Independance by Assault.  Genl. Gates will attack Forts Montgomery & Clinton and be ready to assist Genl. Washington or to lend Assistance to Stark if he fails and also watch Clinton.  Newport in Rhode Island is said to be taken by the New Englanders and 1500 Britons made prisoners, it comes in a Letter from Moore Furman in the Jerseys to some Gentleman in Lancaster.  Congress present Gates with a Medal and their Thanks to him and his officers and Men-Lieut Colo. Smith and Commodore Hazelwood with Swords the one for his gallant Defence of the Fort and the other for destroying the Ships Augusta and Aurora.  I am Yours Affy, Benjamin Rumsey  ""

It is this, with the love of their Country, which has Animated your Troops to endure every hardship with patience, to Encounter every danger to which they were called with Bravery, Untill Victory Crownd their labour & Conquest satisfied their Wishes and desire.

The Chance of Warr was too (great to hazzard) dubious to admit of a Delay, the Advantages proposed by Your Enemy, in their terms of surrendry too great, to leave to Chance. The preserving your Army Undiminished, & in spirit & Vigor for future operations, was wise & prudent.

I wish good old Putt may not think hard of the proposals of congress sent you at this Time. He is really wanted in the neighbourhood of Philada.(1) He is a brave man and will not rest long without Enterprise, tho he cannot maintain posts and fight battles without Soldiers. He was Stripped almost to the Skin, and if Harry Clinton had moved 8 Days Sooner up the River, Albany & your army into the bargain would have been lost. I hope Genl W n still holds the Idea of the Worth of a free Passage between the eastern States & these, which he expressed to Genl. Putnam some time ago. You certainly know the Value of it and will endeavour to gain fresh Laurels in recovering the Forts lately lost at the Highlands or in establishing better Posts, if better Ground is to be had. There is a flying Report that R Island is recovered, and that a third Man of War is burnt in Delaware River. I wish the Bearer may get a Confirmation of this Intelligence on his way to you.  If you are not Sincerely regarded here in general, yet there is at least a modesty as to any appearance of the old Opposition. You would have been pleased at an Incog Survey of Faces for Weeks back.

  Sir York Town Pensylvania 9th November 1777 It is long since that I have been honoured with any of your Excellency's Favours tho' I never so anxiously wished for domestic Intelligence. It is true I am not at a Loss for the Reason; since the Irruption of our implacable Enemies under Sir Henry Clinton, the Attack of Forts Montgomerie & Clinton, and the burning of Kingston, must have given you full Employment. Happy is it under this Train of misfortunes that General Burgoine and his Army have fallen Victims to their Temerity! An example which will probably deter the British ministry from any future Attempt in that Quarter of our State! However grateful to the Supreme Being for this most manifest Interposition of his Providence; believe me, Sir, I feel very sensibly for my much respected Friends in Kingston, whose Virtue and publick spirit place them most deservedly in the highest Esteem with their Countrymen. NOVEMBER 9, 1777  Congress, and I mention it with The utmost Satisfaction, are resolved at every Expence to maintain a sufficient Force for the protection and Security of the Passes in the high lands, and the Communication of Hudson's River;(1) and if it is in the Power of Art, I flater myself effectual means will be, with the utmost Expedition, employd for this most important Purpose.  The Respect paid to your Excellency in the Resolution of Congress for drawing Reinforcements for General Washington from the Northern Army, will give you an opportunity of offering your Sentiments with proper weight on a Subject which materially affects our State; & I have no doubt but that a sufficient Force will be left for our protection .(2)  General Washington has not Judged it adviseable to attack the Enemy in Philadelphia. His Superiority, in numbers, is not thought Sufficient to risk a general Engagement. If the Defences of the Delaware which have hitherto unexpectedly biden defiance to every effort of the Enemy Shoud stand firm, there seems but little doubt that the Enemy will soon experience the want of Provisions, as their Communication with the Country is already greatly intercepted & every means are exerted to cut it off entirely.  This may reduce General How to the necessity of abandoning Philadelphia. By all Accounts the Inhabitants already are extremely distressed & even are trembling for fear of Famine. There are Reports prevailing which woud lead us to imagine that such a Retreat is not far distant. But common Fame is so great a Deceiver that she has lost all Credit with me. Besides, the Reputation of Lord and General Howe, and the Honor of the British arms, woud be so essentially impaird by relinquishing their present Enterprize, that I am persuaded nothing but the most inevitable necessity will bring the Brothers to submit to the Disgrace of a Retreat. The Prospect of Famine, as I have suggested, will shake their Resolutions more than any other Consideration; but this can only be realized by a great Force and the utmost Vigilance on our part, and by a Continuance of that successful Gallantry and Perseverence in defending the Forts and obstructions in the Delaware which have foiled every attempt of the Enemy, altho' conducted by their favourite admiral & their favourite General and vigorously pushed both by Sea & Land.  General Burgoine's Letter to General Howe is already publishd in Philadelphia & the news paper has found it's way to our Camp tho' not to this place.(3) He says, in substance, that his orders were to proceed to Albany: that he suffered great Losses in successive Battles; that the number of effectives in his Army was reduced to 3500 of which 1900 only were British, and his provisions to three days short allowance. That by the advice of all his General & Field Officers & Captains commanding Regiments, he agreed to the Convention with General Gates which he hopes will not be thought dishonourable to   himself or the British nation, since he was surrounded by an Army of 16000 men. He adds, that rather than have submitted to the Terms General Gates first imposed he & his whole army were determind to have perished.  I am sorry to add that at a time when, with the Blessing of Heaven, one Vigorous and well conducted Enterprize woud compel General Howe to follow the Example of General Burgoine, and this State alone has competent Resources to augment, strengthen and supply our Army to the utmost of our wishes; a fatal Langour prevails in all her Councils, and her military Exertions are so feeble, the Body of her Inhabitants so dissatisfied, or so intent upon Gain, that she in effect contributes next to nothing to the Common Cause.  Permit me now, Sir, to claim a moment's attention to the Request I have repeatedly made to be permitted to return to my native State. I have too high a sense of Duty to take this Liberty without the Consent of those who have honoured me with their Esteem and confidence. But the Reasons with which I have formerly troubled your Excellency, the advanced Season of the year, and my long and faithful Services, entitle me I hope to this Indulgence, independent of the assurances that were made me in Convention that I shoud be relievd in three or four months. Mr Duer is equally solicitous to attend his private Affairs as well as his publick Accounts which suffer much by his long Absence. And we both wait impatiently for a Representation from our State. Every thing which might be expected from the little advantages of my Experience has been obtaind, the Confederation which was the last Object being finished except in a few points, and these not very material, & capable of being dispatched in a few days.  Wishing anxiously for the favour of a Line from your Excellency in answer to this & three former Dispatches which have not been noticed, I have the Honour to be, Sir, your Excellency's most obedient & most humble servt, Jas. Duane  P.S. I beg your Excellency to excuse my Incorrectness.

  Gentlemen November 12th 1777 We have received Mr Warrens favour of the 4th & 7th ultimo informing us of the loss of the Brigantine Hampden, and we have no doubt but care has been taken to save as much of that Vessels materials as possible. Should you think what has been saved of those materials worthy of another Hull we would have you purchase One, provided it can be done on reasonable Terms, and that you get one every way well calculated for a Cruizer; particularly in point of sailing as that is a most material object with us. Mr. Bradford the agent at Boston hath lately advised us of the arrival of a Prize Brigantine called the Industrious Bee which he thinks would be suitable for a Cruizer. You will please to order a Court of enquiry on Captain Burroughs and his Pilot and if the Captain is acquitted and you purchase the Hull as above advised we would have the command given to him and when ready for Sea you will dispatch him on a Cruize the most likely for Success.(1) Enclosed are some Resolves of Congress which you will please to have published in all the Eastern Papers. Mr Cushing informs the 36 Gun Ship will soon be launched, but that he knows of no provision of Guns for her. That matter is under your direction and you will use every possible means to Obtain them, and inform us as soon as may be what probability you have of succeeding therein and upon what terms; and you will see that all materials are provided for intire equippment for Sea and that all possible dispatch be given. The Expence of the Navy is very great, but every delay adds to the charge and deprives the States of that advantage over our enemies, and of those supplies which are the great ends of their destination. We sent you by Docter Lynn warrants upon the Loan Offices of Massachusets and Rhode Island to the amount of 100,000 Dollars which we hope considering the present applications for Monies from every quarter will for a time answer the demands on your Department. We are extreamly sorry to find such heavy complaints against Captain McNeill and we hope that Gentleman will be able to justify his conduct but as a Court Martial must be hereafter appointed for that purpose as well as for doing justice to the publick, we cannot consent in the mean time that the public Service should suffer, in addition therefore to what we have already in our formed Letter said to you on that subject we must add, that if you apprehend the services will be injured by Captain McNeills remaining in the command of the Boston, you will suspend him till his conduct respecting his last Cruize is properly enquired into.(2) Should this be done, you will put a person in command of her, the best qualified and most deserving you can procure being already in Commission perhaps you'll find none more deserving than Captain Olney; (3) and NOVEMBER 12, 1777  you will also establish all such Officers in her, as have been in her the last Cruize who from proper inquiry you shall judge adequate to their Stations, notwithstanding any suspensions or arrests of Capt. McNeill. We have sent by Captain Palmes warrants in favour of Mr. Daniel Tillinghast Continental Agent at Providence for 44,000 Dollars and an order in his favour on the Honble Stephen Hopkins Esq for 15,926 Dollars & 8/9ths, which we hope will answer the sums he has hitherto advanced. We shall direct him to exhibit his Account to you till the first of November from the time of his last Accounts exhibited to us. You will examine his vouchers and then transmit his account to us with such observations thereon as may Occur to you, in Order that we may settle the same to that time, after which he will from time to time settle his Accounts with, and make all applications for direction &c to you.  As you have Authority so we approve of the Exchange of any officers from one Ship to another as the service may require, and we doubt not you had sufficient reasons for the Exchange of Captain Granis for Captain Palmes.(4) We are sorry to hear the expedition against Rhode Island was likely to prove unsuccessful, but we hope the getting the Frigates out of Providence River will not depend upon that circumstance. Fully relying on your utmost exertions in that object as well as in every other in your department, We remain Gentlemen, your hble Servants  P.S.

  My dear sir York in Pennsylvania, Novr. 13. 1777 I am favoured with yours of Octr 23d,(1) & find that in the Enjoyment of the News of General Burgoyne's Surrender, You somewhat regretted General Gates's \""suffering himself to be drawn into a Convention.\"" I must confess that when the News first reached this Place, I had similar Feelings, but was somewhat reconciled upon hearing the particulars as delivered by his D. Adjutant General to Congress. It seems that General Clinton with his intended Reinforcement to Burgoyne, at the Time of the Treaty, was within a Day's Sail of Albany, where were the Magazines, Hospitals, & Laboratory of the northern army. This Gates knew, & not being able to detach Troops in Time to defend them, hazarded the Loss of the Whole. His D. A. General further says, that he had but 3 Days Provisions at Saratoga & had Albany been taken, must have retreated without Delay or have starved his Army. But what made the Matter still more critical, Sir Harry Clinton had conveyed Intelligence to Burgoyne, which the latter recd the Day before the Ratification of the Convention, informing him of Clinton's Expectations of relieving him in a few Days, & thereupon General Burgoyne made some cavils & finally informed Colo Wilkinson (the Adjutant mentioned) that Hostilities must again commence; but the latter informing as he left him that General Gates could not be responsible for the Consequences, as his Men considering their General deceived (the Treaty had been several Days upon the Tapis) were highly enraged & zealous for Action, was recalled by G. Burgoyne & desired to favour him with a little further Time to consider of the Matter, which being granted soon ended in his agreeing to the Convention. However was I to judge of the Matter under Circumstances as they respect Gates alone, without recurring to the primary Cause of our Successes, It appears to me that such a powerful Army as he had were intitled to the Terms first demanded \""a Surrender of the other Army Prisoners of War.\"" But we have ever had the greatest Reason to acquiesce in the Determinations of providence relative to our publick as well as private Concerns, & therefore I find myself very happy on the Occasion.  We have this Evening finished the Confederacy, & it will be shortly sent to the several States for their Consideration.(2)  My Expectations from Rhode Island were never great for Reasons too obvious to mention; but I am concerned that the Honor of so many brave Men as composed the eastern Army, should suffer from a Circumstance which they could not foresee or avoid. A thorough Enquiry must be made into this Matter; if We mean to correct such Misconduct, & prevent the like in future.(3)  Our Friends the Mr. Adams left this two Days since,(4) & inclosed are two Letters for Mr. J. Adams, which I must request You to NOVEMBER 13, 1777  deliver him. Agreeable to his Desire, that I would open such Letters as should be directed to him here, I opened these, & finding the largest written by what appears to me a female Hand; if so, I presume it is from his Lady, & must ask her pardon for the Error into which her Friend betrayed me. The Absence of these Gentlemen occasions a Chasm in Congress, who employed the microscopic Eye of the One to penetrate the obscure Designs of intrigueing Adversaries & the deep Erudition of the other to raise Barriers against them. My compliments to them & other Friends & beleive me to be, yours sincerely,  E Gerry  P.S. The Enemy appear to be making great preparations to attack Fort Mifflin. I hope the brave Fellows there will not fall a sacrifice to superior Numbers. Quere, ought not Attention to be diverted by occasional Visits from our Army?  RC Justin G. Turner, Los Angeles, Calif., 1971).  1 Warren's October 23 letter to Gerry is in Gardiner, Warren-Gerry Correspondence, pp. 91-92.  2 This day Congress appointed a committee \""to revise and arrange the articles of confederation agreed to, and to prepare a circular letter to the respective states to accompany the said articles.\"" JCC, 9:900.  3 See Henry Laurens to the Rhode Island Expedition Commissioners, December 15, 1777.  4 John and Samuel Adams had been granted leave .of absence on November 7.

  Dear Sir York Pennsylvania Novr. 13. 1777 The Child Congress has been big with these two Years past, is at last brought forth (Confederation). I fear it will by several Legislatures be thought a little deformed, you will think it a Monster. I wish however some kind of Confederation might take place, many Carry their Ideas of this Matter so far as to believe Our Affairs must be ruined without it; Be this as it may it will in a few days be sent to the Legislatures of the Several States. Nothing more has been done worth your notice. Our time has been chiefly employed in Army matters and God knows we have had perplexity enough.  Genl. Washingtons head Quarters are at White Marsh a few miles from German Town & the Picketts of each army are very near together. We are informed of a large Reinforcement detached from G. Gates Army on their way to join the main Army, & every body hopes a Good account will still be given of Sir William. You left us dissatisfied but when you hear that we still have the Command of the River-Burgoyns whole Army Surrendered-the Noble defence made  NOVEMBER 13, 1777  at Red-bank, Fort Mifflin, &c you will I hope entertain an opinion that Our Armies must conquer wherever they appear notwithstanding the few Checks (perhaps necessary ones) they have lately met with. We have an Account of 30 Transports sailing from New York supposed to bring a reinforcement of troops to Genl. Howe. They are not as yet arrived in the Delaware.  I think as soon as Our main Army receives the reinforcements expected, I should expect to hear of a Vigorous Attack on the Enemy, but I am no General.  At the Battle of German Town I am informed Coll Martin has again been so unfortunate as to meet with Censure. He has been tryed by a Court Martial & Acquitted as I hear; (1) Since the death of our worthy & brave Nash, I have received a Letter from Coll Sumner shewing the Necessity of having a Brigadier appointed. What can your Delegates do in this Case? For Gods sake endeavour to get our Assembly to nominate the Gentlm they would Choose. I am told by several Officers that should Coll Martin be appointed, many resignations would take place as several of the Collonels &c are much dissatisfield with his Conduct. Coll Sumner is I believe next in Rank, a worthy Man. Our Brigade will as soon as Coll Shephard arrives at Camp be a very Respectable One Consisting of 2000 Rank & file. I wish to see Some one or more of my Countrymen at the head of them & hope they may be esteemed in Camp, & out of it, as our worthy Deceased friend was. The sooner one or more Genl. Officers is appointed the better. Indeed we have a right to the Appointment of a Major Genl for our State should it be thought necessary.(2) Pray let me have your opinion freely & dispassionately on the Articles of Confederation. The Mode of Settling the Quota of each State towards defraying the Genl. Expence has taken up much time. Some States were for the Valuation of all the property in each State; Others for fixing it by the Number of inhabitants; Others, on the Value of lands. This Last seemed to come as near the mark as any except a Valuation of all property, however the Value of Lands has taken place, much against the desire of the delegates from the Eastern States.(3)  As I expect you will be directed to return immediately after the rising of Our Assembly, I hope you will take Care to be properly instructed in every Measure they may wish to Accomplish. You ought to be here, no State should have a less number of Delegates than three present in Congress & I hope Our State will Attend Constantly to that rule.  I have a great inclination to return home & wish to be in future excused from this kind of Service. Between you and I we shall be ruined in it, & I wish to make way for some Gentm who values his honor in this way, at a much higher rate than I do. I have not time to say one word more than to desire you'll make my Compliments to All my friends in Assembly. I wrote Mr. Hooper & Maclain a few days  ago, (4) & shall write them again very soon. No Post or Press as yet established here & when I meet with an Opportunity to write my friends I am obliged to do it in such hurry that I hardly know what I write. Believe me to be with unfeigned Esteem, Dr Sir, Your affec & ob Servt,  Cornl Harnett  [P.S.] Our very worthy friend Mrs. Trist is well at Lancaster. I just now received a line from her. I forwarded a Letter from her to you about a fortnight ago which I hope you have received.  ""

  Dr Sir York Pensylvania Novr. 13. 1777 As Our General Assembly are now setting in New Bern I only trouble you with a Letter to Mrs. Harnett.(1) As for News I inclose you only the Printed papers of which I sent you a Copy before, but lest they should not have come to yr. hands I send Duplicates. Genl. Washington is to be reinforced from G Gates's Victorious army, they are hourly expected to arrive at head Quarters. On the Other hand Genl Howe we are informed is to be reinforced from N York, as 30 Transports have sailed from Sandy Hook which are expected at Philadelphia. We still keep, with our little forts & fleet, the Command of the river. It is Expected another Grand Push is soon to be made by the Enemy against Red Bank &c in that Quarter. All our Garrisons have been lately very strongly reinforced & should this Grand attack take place a severe Conflict must ensue, we have every Thing to hope from Our Brave Officers & men in that Quarter & I think nothing to fear. We are informed the Inhabitants of the City begin to be greatly distressed for want of the Necessaries of Life, some I pity, Others perhaps deserve this Calamity, in a very short time it is hoped the Enemy will not be able to procure any Supplies for their Army either by land or Water. Remember me to all My Friends, you know them perhaps better than I do.  NOVEMBER 13, 1777  Get your Vessels out of the river in time so as to make two Voyages during the winter, the risque is allowed to be in Winter only as one to three compared with a Summers Voyage. But these Matters I leave to the Gents. Concerned-Submitting to their Judgement whither at such times as these trade should not be pursued with Vigour & dispatch, as well as War. I am with real esteem, first of all tilling you that Jackey is alive and well, Dr Sir, Your since. friend & Obt Servt,  Cornl Harnett [P.S.] Should you be Overburthened with Money, Mrs. Harnetts receipt I hope you will Conceive equal with my own, for any sum you choose to pay her on the Copartnership Account.

I trust there will be no necessity for further urging the Board; if there Should be, I will not fail to do every thing proper on my part to ward off all the impending Evil of being more deeply involved in Arrears to the Army.  I return the most Sincere thanks for your Excellency's polite compliments on my appointment to the Chair in Congress, a determination equally unthought of & undesired by me, former experiments had instructed me to know & to wish to shun the labour & variety of trouble attendant upon a faithful discharge of the Duty of president.(2) While I continue in that Office & enjoy the honour of your Excellency's correspondence & confidence, it will be impossible for me to be wittingly deficient in any mark of Esteem for a Character, which, after holding near twenty Years in a respectable light, I have learnt to NOVEMBER 13, 1777  revere. Let me also assure your Excellency, there are no incentives which could prevail on me to Spend another day of the fragment of my Life in this or any public station, but the Love of Country.  I am indeed conscious of the narrowness of my abilities for discharging the trust reposed in me with a propriety even to my own Satisfaction, I nevertheless dare trust my Self for diligence, integrity &, at all hazards, for an unwearied attention to the Interests of the United States of America.  Sir, I am incapable of flattering, I hope incapable of an approach to the view, but I should be ungrateful, or unfeeling, if I did not add, that I am perfectly happy under a persuasion that every error or failure of duty which may appear in the process of my present Task will be interpreted & considered by your Excellency with that Candor for which you have ever been distinguished.  Congress from all appearance are well satisfied with the measures taken by your Excellency with respect to the Frigates above Philadelphia & the disposition of part of the Northern Army, the Resolves of the 5th were certainly formed while an opinion prevailed that Fort Clinton was garrisoned by the Enemy & apprehensions of their gaining a formidable footing on Hudson's River fixed in every mind.(3)  Your Excellency will receive with this, a packet containing Commissions for the Field Officers of the Pennsylvania Regiments in Conformity with the arrangement by the Board of Officers, this business has occasioned some delay of the present Express, it was reported to me that there were no blanks & I was under that mistake obliged to Send to Lancaster for a new impression. The Resolutions of Congress on that branch will accompany the Commissions.  14th. While I was attending Congress this Morning your Excellency's Letter of the 11 th was brought into the House & reported.(4) A Report relative to Claims by French Officers happened to be a Subject in debate which continued till adjournment,(5) I am now returning to Duty in the Same place & will apply for directions what answer to return on the important article of Clothing.  It is a Rule in Congress to commit Letters to the consideration of particular Boards, these being dispersed in different parts of the Town & governed by Rules of their own for meeting, it is not always or I should rather Say, 'tis Seldom in the power of the President to answer with that dispatch which may Seem necessary, this may give no information to your Excellency, yet my being uncertain in that particular, I think the intimation not improper in order to account for any apparent omission on my part. Under Cover with this your Excellency will find Copies of Resolves of Congress.  The 10th Inst directing Your Excellency to cause a Strict enquiry to be made into the conduct of Lt. Reynolds as set forth in certain depositions to which the Resolve is annexed.   11th. Ordering Commissions to be granted to Officers in the department of the Commissary general of Military Stores. The Commissions are Issued accordingly.  14th. Relative to Clothing for the Army & continuing the powers with which Your Excellency was vested on the 17th September last to the 1st March next unless Sooner revoked.  14th. Permitting General Schuyler to attend to his private affairs till further Notice.  To the Same effect respecting General St. Clair with the addition of an Order that a Warrant Issue for 150000 Dollars to be remitted to William Bedlow Esquire deputy paymaster at Fish Kill.(6)  It may not be amiss to intimate to your Excellency that the liberty granted to Major General Schuyler followed a Motion founded on a Letter received by a Member of Congress (7) from the General, that to Major General Sinclair proceeded from the appearance of his Name Subscribed at a meeting of a board of Officers & by Special order I am to transmit a Copy of that Resolve to himself.  The Resolve relative to Clothing backed by a Second Address to Several of the Neighbouring States (8) will Shew that Congress have not been inattentive to the necessities of the Army, whatever remissness may appear elsewhere, there are parcels of Clothing at New Orleans, at Charles Town & at Boston the property of the United States, measures are now taken which I hope will bring the whole forward & some parts very soon. Besides these I this morning dispatched Orders to Boston for purchasing in private hands a quantity of Clothing Sufficient as Major Genl. Heath has informed for about 10000 Men & also a large quantity of Shoes. The Public are indebted to the vigilance of Major Genl. Heath for this discovery. He not only Sent Notice by an Express Messenger that Such articles were to be purchased at Newberry Port & Salem but has Secured a preference to Congress. Upon this very important occasion I will move Congress for leave to Send duplicates by a Second Express in order to guard against possible accidents of delay or miscarriage.  A report was this morning made by the Board of War on the \""Opinion of the Officers of the Virginia Line\"" & recommitted.(9)  Among other papers in the present dispatch will be found a packet containing Nine intercepted Letters for persons with the Enemy, these have been inspected & are now Submitted to your Excellency's disposal.  Congress have ordered additional Sums to be paid to the French Gentleman of Mr. Du Coudray's suite & Some others. Resolved to give Monsr. St. Colombe a Captain's Commission & appear determined to Stop there.(10) Some who are not provided for, I fear will be reduced to piteous circumstances & must be relieved from private purses or suffer the most grievous inconveniencies.  I remain with the greatest respect & esteem.  ""

  Sir York Town Novr. 13th. 1777 Congress have refered the enclosed Petition to the Council of this State, together with which we were desired to furnish a more particular account of the Petitioner, Parson Batwell's state of health &c, accordingly we have just visited him, and found him a Prisoner in a private house much emaciated, and afflicted with Rhumatic pains in his Knees, which incapacitates him for walking, but confessed he was much better than while he was in prison.(1) He offers his parole as well as Bail if he is allowed to go to his former place of aboad in this County, twenty one miles distant from hence, or permitted to take the fresh Air, and exercise here, for the recovery of his health, which we are of opinion may effect it. He requests a speedy result of your Honble Board that he may sell or remove his Effects and three Children now at the above place, a Glebe belonging to the Church, as he cannot afford to keep two families. The Papers belonging to Mr. Batwell taken with his person were deposited in the hands of Mr. McClane in this Town,(2) who applied to one of us to know how they should be disposed of, which was moved to Congress, but they would give no orders concerning them, therefore they wait your Commands, and are as yet undisclosed, except two letters of no great importance communicated to one of us.  We have the happiness to inform the State that Confederation has this Evening passed Congress, but have it not in our power as yet to communicate it, as the several articles tho agreed to are not arranged in the order they are to appear, which we hope will be effected tomorrow, as they are committed for that purpose, and to have it in our power very soon to lay them before the State, therefore we ardently wish a full representation of the State may be convened to receive them, and that a Determination upon them may be speedy, as the ratification in our opinion is of infinite importance to the Independance of America.

Fowler, who has been detained here for a New Impression of blank Commission from Lancaster, of such you will now receive fifty.(1) If these are not sufficient for the purposes intended an addition will be made upon the first requisition from you. When these Commissions are Issued you will be so good as to transmit a return in order that proper records may be Entered in the War Office.  Inclosed you will find a Resolve of Congress touching the subject of paying the Troops for Rations which implies an approbation of the measures you had pursued in that branch, restricting the practice within the bounds of necessity to be determined by your judgement.(2) Congress have not considered the necessity for sending any of its Members to liquidate extra Accounts. I shall remind the House again of the subject that at least somewhat more explicit may be said than I am authorized to offer at present.  On the subject of Money, when I pressed the Chairman of the Treasury to send you an immediate supply, he informed me that 200,000 Dollars were on the way to you when you wrote, besides the Order for the like Sum on the Connecticut Loan Office, that 200,000 Dollars more is provided for your department & that with all possible expedition a further supply shall be sent. Demands for a greater Sum than ever was called for at one time, have at this juncture conspired to impoverish the treasury. The business there has also been greatly obstructed by the removal of Congress but is now restored again to good order & the fund will soon be replenished.

Adams relative to the Business in Congress,(1) and also omit at present general chit chat of Men, Women & Things, Yet one little Piece of History wch. is peculiarly adapted to yr. improving Fancy I must put down. Mr. Hancock's Waggoner who went with Mr. Hancock to Boston, after his Return to Germantown his Home fancied to visit his parents in Philadelphia where he was pointed out by one Corey a Breeches maker and put under guard but by the Intercession of one of the Allen's who had been schoolmate with him, and who mentioned that the mans circumstances obliged him to work for Mr. Hancock as well as any other who might incline to employ him. Mr. Laurens asked the Waggoner if he was in Philada. when the Defeat of Count Dunop was reported there first; he answered yes, and, that the Hessians were exceedingly cast down. He turned his Eye to a Table & asked the President whether the large book upon it was a Bible; on being answered yes, he turned to the 2d Part of the 44th Psalm and read the Poetry which he declared the Hessians sang on meeting their surviving Chief. The President bid him remember that it was a Bible in his Hand; and also asked him if he would take his Oath. The man replied that he would not swear he heard them sing, but he would swear that one or two Officers read those verses in the Guard Room as the verses which the Hessians had been solemnly singing.  They must be deeply touched indeed to make a religious ceremony and openly therein avow their disgrace.  It is said they are mighty Bible men each being Possessor of one.  My head snaps with writing and the two Fouquets are chattering French at my Elbow in the Board of War Room. Therefore I conclude yr. affectionate, obliged, James Lovell  P.S. I should not have kept my regards for your Lady to be presented in a postscript, if I was not bent upon following them with Something adequate to a downright Execration of the Enemies of my Country and the Liberties of Mankind.

  Dear Sir,(1) York 15th November 1777. If it had been in my power you could not have wished a person more ready to Serve you than I Should have been in the affair referred to in your favour of the 2d. September which was delivered to me as it happened two days too late for a particular interposition on behalf of the Appellee in the Case of the Schooner Rosanna & the Cause had been matured for judgement before I had been named to the Bench for hearing & deciding upon Appeals in prize Cases. Therefore I purposely refrained from Sitting when the final opinion was to be pronounced.(2)  I had indeed perused Copies of the proceedings & from them had formed a judgement of my own without knowing particularly who was Interested. Immediately upon receipt of your Letter I determined if needful to employ an Advocate, but upon application to Colo. Harnet with offers of my assistance he informed me the Bench had by their Sentence reversed the Decree given in Admiralty & ordered restitution of property or value to be made to the Appellants. Hence I ought in modesty to think my own opinion erroneous, but although I am far from being an obstinate fellow & pay great deference to Some of the Gentlemen of the Bench I cannot honestly Say I acquiesce (3)-the pursuit of that phantom is however at an end.  All the great News of Burgoyne John Esqr. &ca. will have been familiar before this can reach you. Our Eyes are now fixed upon Delaware. Forts Mifflin & Mercer together with Some of our Armed Vessels have performed such Acts of Defence against the attempts NOVEMBER 15, 1777  of a British fleet & Army as will unite the Commanders in future history with the Name of Franklin when that valuable Man Shall be particularly celebrated for his construction of the Marine Cheveaux de frize. Force upon force continually repeating attacks upon those brave Men, if they fall, Honour will attend them & the Enemy will have made a dear & inglorious purchase of victory. The detail of this part of our War will astonish Europe-at least will be admired there. General Washington has afforded all the reinforcements he can Spare to their Support, the Forts are respectively in better posture for defense than they were a Month ago but the late arrival of Troops from New York Supposed to be upwards of three Thousand may enable the Enemy to overpower the Garrisons, if ever that happens it will be accompanied by Shocking Carnage. The loss on that Side has already been great. 1 Ship of 64 Guns & 1 Frigate burnt-one 64 Gun Ship exceedingly injured & Several others very much hurt & at a moderate computation drowned, Slain & Captured full one thousand Men. On our part the killed & wounded Scarcelly exceed Sixty. The Rascals who gave up the Ship Delaware & a few Deserters from the Gallies to be added.  I expect the next Letters will announce the arrival of reenforcements from four to Six Thousand Men to General Washington. Our contest will then Seem to be drawn to one point where I hope the Campaign will happily terminate in our favour. I dare not trust myself to believe with some people this Years Success will end the War.  Capt. Hyrne will relate to you the Starving condition of the Enemy & false friends in Philadelphia, how we frequently make prisoners & daily receive deserters, the discontents of the Hessian Officers & Troops & many other articles not omitting a Scandalous retreat from Rhode Island. I will not further trouble you but to repeat that I am with great regard &ca.  P.S. You may be told Our General is under a pernicious influence of two General Officers.(4) Suspend Judgement. I have seen the General's Sentiments very fully & freely written to a friend on that Subject. I will not beleive a word of the Whispers.  ""

  Dear Sir, York the 15th of Novr. 1777 The Bearer of this, Capt. Romane is a Gentleman of Monsr. Coudrays corps who arrived here lately from Charles Town and is now returning by the way of Boston to France with his companions This young Gentleman is Nephew to General Grebouval Commander of the French Artillery, and he is a modest well behaved youth. At his request I willingly introduce him to you, and I am sure that from personal, as well as political considerations, you will render Capt. Romane's stay in Boston as agreeable to him as possible. This gentleman had once determined to pass the winter at Annapolis in order to learn the English language, but his Countrymen, it seems, have persuaded him to return with them to France. Their design, we understand, for so doing, is to fortify themselves with interest and numbers, in order to give greater weight to their representations of ill usage in America. I am much dissatisfied my dear friend with this whole business, because I apprehend pernicious consequences will result to our Country and its cause from the complaints of these gentlemen, who are of consideration in France and well supported there. I have endeavored to avert this mischief by every means in my power, and I think it will conduce to this end if the Gentlemen of Boston were to treat these Officers with attention and make their stay in Boston agreeable as possible. Our affairs about Philadelphia are in Statu quo, but how long they will continue so I do not know, because we learn that a fleet from New York has arrived in the Delaware with reenforcements to Howe. We have at length finished the Confederation and shall send it to the different States in a few days with strong exortation to give it quick consideration and speedy return.(1) Taxation, Finance, and recruiting the Army will also be strongly recommended.

Dayton yet the many applications of a similar nature from Officers of the Army made them hesitate about allowing him a Horse. The affair however was referred to the Board of War. Should I not leave Congress soon I will use my influence to obtain the Consent of that Board to the measure.(1)  Please to give my respects to Col. Dayton, inform him what I have done in his favour & that I should have applied to Congress in his behalf sooner than I did but saw no prospect of succeeding. I will serve him as far as shall be in my power.  I am your Hble Servt. Jona. Elmer  ""

  Dear Sir York 18th November 1777 I have of late been obliged, I may truly Say obliged, to give so many recommendatory Letters to poor disappointed French Officers who will call upon you, I fear being very troublesome.(1)  I draw however some consolation from knowing there is only one more in the way, for whom I shall apply to obtain your countenance & Civilities & that upon the whole I am in hopes you will suffer neither inconvenience nor real loss by an acquaintance with so many  NOVEMBER 18, 1777  inhabitants of a Kingdom with which America will probably be connected in Commerce.  Le Chevalr. Dorset will be the bearer of this, he has Strove hard & Stooped low, in order to get a Commission in our Service, but it was judged impossible. This does not arise from any aversion to the French on our part, the contrary is clear, from these considerations, that we have a numerous train of French Officers in the Army, & that I Signed last Night & the day before no less than five new Commissions for such Vizt. to Rank one Brigadier, two Colonels, one Lt. Colonel & one Captain. The Chevalier is well recommended by Doctor Franklin, he will strive to obtain employment in his profession at Charles Town & I have assured him if 'tis in your power to assist him you will, and not keep him in suspence, which is the only ground he had for complaint against Congress, & even that, admitting there had been cause, is removed by a handsome donation made to him yesterday.(2)  Congress have made free with the funds in their power, from motives of humanity & policy, by giving such Sums to those disappointed Speculatists who had been induced to cross the Atlantic, from hearing there was a fine war on this Side, as they would refuse to any equal number of our home borne friends, who had even borne the burthen of our Struggle.  I shall have occasion within three days to dispatch an express Messenger to Charles Town who will probably be with you before the Chevalier. Therefore I shall only add my respectful Compliments to all my friends in & out of your House & that I continue with sincere affection & regard &ca.  ""

  Dear Sir 18th Novr. [1777] It appears by Returns this day rec'd. from Genl. Gates that Burgoine must have destroyed his Standards and almost every other military Trophy during the Capitulation.(1) Not one Musket fit for use was delivered, not one Scabbard to a Bayonett or Cutlass. We are told that instead of piling the Arms the Enemy chose to ground them, that the Waggons might more certainly crush them. Gates does NOVEMBER 18, 1777  not notice this as a Breach of Convention, tho his Returns show the Facts; yet he says that if Howe obstinately refuses an honourable Cartel it is proper to delay fulfilling the Convention. I wish you had not left York till now, as I join in the Opinion of many here. Today, a Committee ought to know the Facts first exactly from Gates, and be empowered to proceed from Albany to Boston, if found necessary. You know I was critical about not violating the Treaty: But the Returns have proved very unfair Dealing on the part of Burgoyne.  You would scold me yourself if you knew how sick I am and what Hour of the Night it is. You must see Mr. S. Adams for I scrawl one Thing to him and another to you out of pure OEconomy.

  Honourable Gentlemen, York Town, Novr. 3d [ca. 19] 1777.(1) Your despatches of the 22d of October, were safely delivered by the express. I thought it advisable, Mr. Duer being absent a few days for the benefit of health, to detain him till Congress should have time to deliberate and determine upon the delicate and important propositions you recommend to their attention. They are now submitted to a committee and you shall be acquainted with the result.(2)  Every body here is sensibly touched at the melancholy catastrophe which followed the loss of the passes in the Highlands. When so great a number of troops were withdrawn, I predicted the fatal event. In calling away 1500 men, Congress in my opinion, went too far; I strenuously remonstrated against it, but in vain.(3) The hopes of being able to subdue General Howe by such a reinforcement preponderated. No member could be persuaded that it was in Sir Henry Clinton's power to give the State of New-York the least disturbance. The report of his having received reinforcements was not credited. The  NOVEMBER 19, 1777  unhappy measure was therefore adopted; to add to the misfortune, General Washington had before ordered forward a thousand men. Indeed both he and Congress were led into an opinion that General Putnam's army consisted of between seven and eight thousand men. Had it been really the case, probably no mischief would have ensued. I was among the unbelievers.  While I reprobate the savage conduct of our unfeeling invaders, so disgraceful to human nature, most sincerely do I condole with my suffering fellow citizens, whose public virtues and generous patriotism entitle them to the respect even of enemies.  The loss of the forts and the ruined defences, will, I flatter myself, be speedily and effectually repaired; Congress being determined to spare no expense which shall be thought necessary. They view the importance of Hudson's river, and the merit of our State in as high a point of light as yourselves could wish; and I am confident that there is nothing your Delegates could ask on this occasion which would be withheld. General Gates is already invested with ample powers for every purpose necessary to our security.  Permit me to change this gloomy subject, and to congratulate you on the reduction of General Burgoine and his army; an event which ought to raise our gratitude to the Supreme Being, the more especially, as it may be considered as a strong foundation of future repose in the northern frontier of our State. Nothing material has happened between the grand armies since the battle of German Town. The Howes' apply their whole attention to reduce the forts and remove the obstructions in the Delaware. Fort Mifflin, which we never esteemed capable of defence, has withstood a violent siege by land and water for seven weeks. It is now in ruins; the palisadoes levelled; most of the artillery useless; the barracks and stores destroyed; and nothing but the spirits of the garrison and the battery remaining. A report prevails that it is evacuated; we have no authentic intelligence, but it is more than probable.(4) General Washington, on his part, is endeavoring to cut off the communication between the city and country in order to starve the enemy. They however found means to introduce a supply in three vessels, which in a strong wind and tide passed between the fort and Province island, in spite of a heavy cannonade; the shot from which frequently pierced through their sides. The rapidity of their passage prevented their destruction.  It is generally believed if the enemy do not get up their shipping in ten days they will quit Philadelphia to preserve the fleet; but that if they succeed, it will be made their winter quarters. The weather here is very cold and both armies suffer extremely, ours more especialy for want of clothing. It is an undoubted fact that Gen. Howe is much discouraged both at the unexpected and obstinate resistance of the forts, and at the fate of Burgoine, whose victory over Genl. Gates he had authoritatively announced.  Be pleased to accept my best thanks for the leave of absence with which I am indulged. The confederation is completed and I expect will be forwarded by this conveyance, as it is in the press at Lancaster.(5) Nothing of any very interesting nature will be left unfinished when I set out; the day is uncertain, as neither Mr. Morris nor Lewis have yet arrived.  I have the honour to be, With the utmost regard, honl. gentlemen, Your most obedient and very huml. servant,(6)  Jas. Duane.  Reprinted from Journals of the N.Y. Prov. Cong., 2:439.  1 Although this letter is dated November 3 in Journals of the N.Y. Prov. Cong., Duane's discussion of reports about the November 15 evacuation of Fort Mifflin closely resembles the discussion of the same subject in his November 19 letter to Philip Schuyler and suggests that both were written about the same time. See also below, notes 4 and 5. It is also pertinent to note that Duane continued the letter on November 22 and that a transcript of it made in the nineteenth century for Jared Sparks is simply dated \""Novemb 1777.\"" Sparks Manuscripts, MH-H.  2 The council of safety's October 22 letter to the New York delegates is not mentioned in the journals of Congress, and there is no mention in the council of safety's records of an October 22 letter to Congress. A text of the letter to the delegates is in Journals of the N.Y. Prov. Cong., I :1072. William Duer was apparently absent from Congress between November 9 and 19, judging from the omission of his name in the journals for those days.  3 A reference to Congress' September 12 order to Gen. Israel Putnam to send a reinforcement of 1,500 men to Washington after the battle of Brandywine. JCC, 8:736.  4 There was a report about the evacuation of Fort Mifflin in the November 17 issue of the Pennsylvania Evening Post.  5 Congress both approved the final version of the Articles of Confederation and ordered 300 copies of them to be printed on November 15. JCC, 9:907-28. According to Daniel Roberdeau, the Articles still had not been sent to Lancaster for printing as of November 16. See Roberdeau to George Bryan, November 16, 1777.  6 For the continuation of this letter, see Duane to the New York Council of Safety, November 22, 1777.

A Report prevails that after a siege both by Land and Water of seven Weeks Fort Mifflin is evacuated. I take it for granted that it cannot long resist the vast Efforts against it, even if this Account shoud prove premature. The Garrison have already immortalized themselves by uncommon Valour and Perseverance. It is some days since that the Palisadoes have been demolished, the Fort in Ruins, & the Barracks  NOVEMBER 19, 1777  and every Accommodation for the Troops destroyed; and that only two Cannon remaind servicable. The Battery alone was in a Condition to annoy the Enemy. The brave Garrison still retaind their Spirits.(1) In other Respects the Condition of the two Armies is the same as mentiond in my last: except that General Howe has found means in a high wind & strong Tide to get a Supply of Provisions to his Army in three Vessels which passed the Fort thro' a heavy Cannonade in the Channel between that & Province Island.  I thought it advisable to obtain the enclosd Resolution to enable you If you shoud think fit to repair your misfortunes at Saraghtoga, and to prevent a Long & disagreeable Attendance at Head Quarters where you cou'd not live but in manner the most uncomfortable and expensive.(2) With usual Compliments, I remain, Dear Sir, most respectfully, Your most obedt & hume servt, Jas.

A person from Philadelphia well known by the Name of John Brown was Reported to Congress yesterday by Mr. Morris as having come to him with a Message from General Sir Wm.

This Man pretends to have come through General Potters Camp & to have dined with the General. He had been Some eight or ten days from Philadelphia at Manheim, Lancaster & other places. At Lancaster the Executive Council of this State had ordered him into Custody. He was released from confinement upon Mr. Morris's application and promise to bring him before Congress.

  Sir York Town Novr. 19th 1777 I am honoured with your several favours of the 15th, 16th & 17th Instant (1) to which I will reply at length if time and the extream coldness of the weather will permit, but I no sooner express my desire than I find myself limited to a few minutes. The regulation of the prices of necessaries for the army and the Quota's for each State until better ascertained I expect will be both reported this day by Committee's.(2) I acknowledge Shelly's affidavit come to hand which I  NOVEMBER 19, 1777  doubt not will satisfy every Inquirer. As soon as Confideration is returned from Lancaster, compared and signed it will be instantly forwarded to the respective States, with a Letter already prepared, warmly urging the passage of it, and that Delagates be returned to Congress to confirm a Confideration by the 10th March, therefore I hope our State will have a Legislative Body together to consider this important work, if not assembled in any State it is the earnest request of the above hinted address that the Executive should immediately call them together. The alarming account of the Depredations on our western Frontier was without delay laid before Congress,(3) and a report brought in on too large a Scale for the occasion as your Letter as well as the conjecture of some Members made highly probable. Genl. Hand as you know, was sent westward authorised by this State to call the Militia together for the very purpose now solicited by the back Inhabitants, but they it seems were not in a humour to turn out, for this, that and a thousand other Reasons which probably could not be obviated without violating the Militia Law and Discarding many Officers the Genl. perhaps not excepted. An inquiry is on foot respecting the principles and conduct of Coll. Morgan, but as far as it has gone we find the Genl. involved in the same predicament, and that it is no other than the unreasonable Clamour of some discontented Spirits, however I am resolved to go to the bottom if it has any. But I am very apprehensive the Deity self interest reigns predominant in the Western as well as every other quarter of our Land, and that a desire to enrich themselves has too much influence and that from this principle many lean minds would stir up a dust among the Savages even at this unseasonable time. Your application I believe will end among other measures in the appointment of Commissioners out of Congress to make a full inquiry into these discontents and particularly into a hellish design of Conspiracy, therefore I beg the State would immediately furnish me with the names of two Gentlemen capable of such a negotiation at Pitsbourgh, that I may be ready for a nomination in case it should be necessary, for of myself I cannot fix on a suitable person.(4) I hope the attempt of imposition in the prices of the provisions westward will be thoroughly sifted and exposed, for without vigour in the warmest attacks against extortion, fraud &c with which alas! our unhappy land abounds, the horrid vices threaten the ruin of our Country and the vengeance of Almighty God! from such enormities good Lord deliver us. Mr. Galbraith is referred to the board of War and will be immediately dispatched, but I cannot be more particular.(5) I wish your intelligence of Lord Stormont may be true but it wants confirmation. I think with submission any application to Congress respecting the expence of the Stockades had better come immediately from Council, but best of all from Genl Hand which is most natural especially if he ordered them. I mention this because it  was urged upon me by Mr. Galbreath, and at this time particularly it would be unseasonable as we are immersed in business and I believe do at least twice as much as we were wont. The loss of Fort Mifflin is no deminution of the honor of the brave defenders, but this news is not confirmed yet I fear is too true. I am rejoiced at your mentioning an inquest you intended on the unhappy Officer you mention. The want of this of late in our State among other things had much distracted my mind, a thousand things call for the particular attention of the Legislature when assembled, and I wish I had time to enumerate many things that occur but this may be subject of a future letter for I am forbid adding but that I am most respectfully, Sir, Yr. most obt. hume. Servt. Danl. Roberdeau  P.S. A Gentleman is just come in upon me and contradicts the taking of fort Mifflin.  I have not even time to read this over therefore pray do not introduce me into Company in such a Desshabille.  I have not time to speak of Brown, he is refered to you, pray take Care of this friend to American Independency and do let us be imposed on by such a miserable Toll.

  Sir, York Town 20th Novemb. 1777 As my Term of Delegation expires in a few days, & business of Importance requires my attendance elsewhere, I propose leaving Congress tomorrow. The State of New Jersey will then be unrepresented.  NOVEMBER 20, 1777  I thought it my duty to acquaint you with it, & to request the Assembly immediately to send forward one or more Delegates from the State.  I have made it my business ever since I have had the honour of a seat in Congress to attend as constantly as possible. Whether I have discharged the important trust reposed in me by my constituents to their satisfaction or not I must leave to them to judge. I can however with truth declare that I have at all times exerted myself to the utmost of my slender abilities for the good of My Country & in particular of the state which I have had the honour of representing.  Congress hath at length compleated the Confederation. It is now printing & will be sent forward in a few days for the consideration & approbation of our Legislature.  The distance of the public Treasury of our state from my place of abode when at home, & my not having had an opportunity of waiting upon the Assembly when sitting, have prevented my receiving any money for public services through the treasurer's hands. I received 300 dollars of Mr. Clarke in July last for which I gave him a receipt & for which he enagaged to account to the Assembly. Since that I have drawn on the Continental Treasurer for 700 dollars, to be charged to the State of New Jersey & for which I expect to account to the State.  The expence of attending Congress upon the most oeconomical plan I have been able to draw, amounts to considerably more than the sum of 20/ a day. I rely on the generosity of the Assembly to make me such an additional allowance as they shall deem adequate. Observing to you Sr. that my expenses for the 7 weeks I have attended Congress in this place, for supporting myself & one horse amounts to £60. The Delegates from every other State have from 5 to 8 dollars a day & in general complain they cannot subsist on the pay allowed them by their respective States.

The River has been as well defended as could possibly be expected, but Our brave Coll. Smith was a few days ago obliged to leave Fort Mifflin in ruins to the Enemy. Bob Morris still thinks the Enemys Ships will not be able to get to Philadelphia this NOVEMBER 20, 1777  winter; others are very doubtful, for my part I anxiously look for the time of the river being froze over; this seldom happens before Christmas. We can not find the reinforcement from N. York yet arrived, but Genl Howe hourly expects it, some say 3 some 5 thousand. Genl Washington's Strong reinforcement from Gl. Gates' Army will be at head Quarters tomorrow. If you was here you would think a General Attack should be made on the City immediately. Others immagine that Genl. Howe may, in the Course of this winter be Starved out, but I think we have no right to expect two British Armies in One year to Surrender. In my next, however I will if I can, send good News. The Expectation of the people is great, they believe as soon as Gates' Victorious Troops arrive at H Quarters Genl. Howes Army will be ruined. I am also of this Opinion.  Coll. Martin has been Tryed by a Court Martial or Court of Inquiry, I dont know which On his behaviour at German Town, and acquitted. Our Brigade (the high Officers of it) are exceedingly anxious to have a Genl. Officer Appointed. I wish it were done. You know the Delegates Concluded to take the Opinion of the Genl Assembly. I wish this Could be speedily done. You know better than I do how our Colls. stand as to Rank, Martin, Sumner, Polk I believe. As far as I can find from the Officers I have Conversed with, They wish for Sumner & Clarke, this might Cause several Resignations. We have too many Officers for the number of men; you know Congress Catch at resignations with great Eagerness. A New board of War is Appointed. Genl. Mifflin, Mr. Hamilton (1) & another Gentleman I think the Adjutant General of the Army. Genl Mifflin resigns his Office of Qr. Master General, but holds his rank of Major Genl. without Pay.  Your favourite Confederation is at last finished, it only waits to be Printed & sent on by the President to the Legislatures of the Several States for their Approbation, with a pressing Letter from Congress on that Subject, which you will soon See.(2) Our Finances are in such a Scituation, that unless the States agree immediately to tax as high as the People can possibly bear, the Credit of our Money must be ruined. Another very Large Emission must take place, there is no preventing it. The Treasury board see the fatal Consequences of this Measure-But they also perceive when we have no Money, we shall have no Army. The Loan Offices are already drained to the utmost farthing. The Prospect before us is truly distressing-we must however Continue further Emissions. I tremble at the Consequences. A Defeat of Genl. Howes Army must I think be Attempted, should we Succeed we shall be on our Legs again, I wish the whole force of America could be Collected to Effect this grand purpose. Our worthy and agreeable friend Mrs. Trist is well. I shall soon send my Carriage for her & Mrs. Ross, they intend a Visit to Mrs. Ross's relation in this Town.   For Gods sake get the Assembly to recommend Genl. Officers for Our Brigade. As soon as Coll Sheppard joins them, they will Consist of at least 2000 rank & file. They are exceedingly uneasy. They are at present Commanded by the brave McDugal, yet they imagine they appear Contemptible in the eyes of the Army, not having One Genl. Officer from Our State.

I sent you, Mrs. Harnett, Mr. Hooper & Mr. Maclain particular Accounts of the Battles of Brandywine & German Town, together with every transaction Since at Saratoga, North River &c. If you do not receive them I can not help it. I am convinced Letters are Opened in Our Post Office & not Suffered to pass to the Place intended. Since Congress have been in this Town it has been impossible to write by Post, as it passes through at no certain day only Comes in late at night & Setts of] very early in the Morning. All the Members Complain of this & we shall in a few days have an Office in the Town, I assure you I have been obliged to Catch at transient Oppertunities and many times wrote in such hurry that I could only write a few lines to let My friends & family know I was well, Mr. Pen has more Leisure than I have, I never in my life went through so much fatigue, being Obliged to Sit all day in Congress & often very Often in the Treasury board till 11 at night.  I have told you in several of my Letters that Nothing can be purchased here but at a most exhorbitant Price, no Distiller either White or Black to be got at any rate or indeed Victuals to eat, in this once plentiful Country. I tell you again the 9th or 10th time that Jackey was very well about a Month ago. Mr. Gillon has been detained much Longer than he expected which gives me an Oppertunity of answering your Letter. We have indeed been very unlucky in the NOVEMBER 20, 1777  fighting way in this Quarter but the Success of Genl Gates has made some amends for our Misfortunes here. Fort Mifflin is Certainly taken by the Enemy & it is supposed they will at last get their Ships up the river, some immagine by this means Genl Howe will be enabled to keep possession of Philadelphia this winter. A large reinforcement from Genl Gates' Army will in a day or two Join Genl Washington. Perhaps we shall soon see a reverse of fortune, Genl Howe also expects from N York a Strong reinforcement. The Public have been much Abused in regard to the Numbers of Genl Washingtons army. It never exceeded 16,000 Including Militia which did him little service in either Battle. We have Supposed Howe could not consist of more than 10,000, but it is immagined by the best Judges to exceed that number now, after the great Losses they met with in the two last Actions. We are generally too apt to lessen the Number of Our Enemys Army, & Exaggerate that of our own, which is bad Policy. We have no Press here, I can therefore send you no papers. I wrote Mr Hooper & Mr Maclain (1) by way of New Bern a few days ago & beg you'll forward the inclosed immediately. The Indians have been of late very Troublesom about the Neighbourhood of Fort Pitt, have murdered several of the inhabitants, burnt their houses & destroyed their Grain &c. We hope a Speedy Stop will be put to their Devastations & that they will be reduced to the necessity of defending their own Towns, as the war will no doubt be carried Speedily into their own country.  Congress have finished the Confederation. It will be sent by express to the Assemblies of the several States for their Consideration. I heartily desire to be at home, & whenever I get there I shall with pleasure give up this very disagreeable & troublesom Office.

  Dear Sir, York 20th November 1777 I have no doubt of being excused by you for not sooner answering your favor of the 24th last,(1) when you are informed that my ill state of health has prevented me from attending as I ought to the important matter it contains. I gave Mr. Jones the letter, that he might inform Congress of such parts as it imported the public they should be acquainted with. As it appeared by the letters of Gen. Mifflin that he objected only to serve in the Quartermasters department, that his health was returning, and that he was willing to continue his aid to the public cause, Congress appointed him one of the Commissioners of the new Board, because he is competent to the right discharge of its duties, because that would best suit his valetudinary state, and as shewing a just sense of his uniform, vigorous, and well founded patriotism. I have strong hopes, that by the skill and industry of this new Board, and from the right execution of business in that important department, you will in future find great relief. Gen. Conway has not lately been mentioned in Congress,(2) nor has there been much talk of an Adjutant General, since it is not certainly known whether Colo. Pickering will accept his new appointment. Mr. Flemmings character stands very fair, and so far as I am able to judge, would answer well in this commission. You will see in the inclosed what Mr. Sergeant says of him.(3) General Mifflin has proposed a plan for the Quartermaster department that appears judicious, and well fitted to answer the purpose of good service and (Economy at the same time.(4) He would divide this department into its military and civil branches, the former to be filled by a person well qualified to discharge its duties, and the latter, again to be divided into Commissaries of Teams, of Forage, of Tents &c &c to be governed in their purchases by estimates from the Quarter Master general who is to touch no money but a moderate tho sufficient salary.  It [is] unfortunately too true, that our enemies pay little regard to good faith, or any obligations of justice and humanity, which renders the convention of Saratoga a matter of great moment, and it is also, as you justly observe, an affair of infinite delicacy. The undoubted advantage they will take, even of the appearance of infraction on our part, and the American Character, which is concerned in preserving its faith inviolate, cover this affair with difficulties, and proves the disadvantage we are under in conducting war against an old, corrupt, and powerful people, who having much credit and influence in the world will venture on things that would totally ruin the reputation of young and rising communities like ours. The English however, were not to blame in the business of Closter Seven.(5) That convention was left incomplete by the Commanders NOVEMBER 20, 1777  who made it. Twas stipulated particularly that the Court of Versailles must ratify, and that within a certain time, which was not done until long after the time was elapsed, and before which ratification the Troops of Hanover had returned to arms. Upon this occasion the good faith of England is not impeached. It is greatly to be regretted that the situation of your Army unfits it for vigorous action, because it is very obvious that the enemies possession of Philadelphia this winter and the ensuing spring may produce consequences extensively injurious. You well know, Sir, how weak and divided the people of this State are from various causes. Those of Delaware are still worse. In this condition, with the infinite arts of our enemies, pushed up almost to the center of the above governments, and aided by the powerful means of supplying the wants fanciful and real of the people with all kinds of European goods and Salt, it will be no great matter of surprize if we were to find a total revolution in Pennsylvania and Delaware. Add to this, the ill condition of our finances which totter upon every seeming success of the enemy. It is not to be supposed that where so much is at stake G. Britain will fail to make most potent efforts to recover her honor and prevent her ruin. Upon this ground we may expect considerable reinforcements, and early as possible in the spring. With an Army much strengthened, Gen. Howe may effect purposes dangerous to America. It happens too, unluckily for us, that in order for us to support the credit of our money, the several States must of necessity impose large and immediate Taxes. This is the most delicate and difficult of all government operations even in old and undisturbed States. Yet it is unavoidable, and Congress have pressingly requested that it may be quickly and extensively entered upon.  It was most evident to discerning men that the change in the Commissariate at the time it was adopted would produce most mischievous consequences, yet such was the rage of reformation that no endeavors to prevent the evil could avail, and now I feel the most anxious solicitude for fear the consequences may disperse our army even in face of the enemy. A Committee is appointed to confer with the Commissary general and to try what can be done to avert the evil.(6) I wish they may be fortunate enough to hit upon a remedy. That there should be a want of flour amazes me, and proves great want of attention in the Commissary Gen. because I well know that any quantity might have been got in Virginia at a reasonable price. By our last dispatches from the West Indies, it would seem as if a war between France & England was inevitable, unless the meanness of the latter should restore all her Captures made from the former without the limits prescribed by treaty, and which have been made under authority of an Act of Parliament. But the royal spleen against America is such, that every consideration falls before the wish to subjugate this free country. Yet Mr. Bingham mentions that the   ministerial writings are calculated to rouse the national resentment against France. If so, tis evident they want to set Europe on fire that the smoke may cover them from the eyes of their injured country. Mr. Carmichael writes that Dr. Lee was returning to Paris from Berlin, having finished his business successfully at the Prussian Court, & Mr. Bingham says 'tis certain that the King of Prussia has opened his Ports to the United States, and that Portugal has deserted the interest of England, and acceeded to the family compact. This is all good news, and will I hope furnish employment quickly for our unprincipled enemies.  My ill state of health will compel me to return home in a few days where I shall continue ardently to pray for your health and success.  I am dear Sir affectionately yours, Richard Henry Lee  ""

  Dear Sir, Lancaster 20th Novr. 1777  I have recd. a Letter this Morning from Mr. Duane,(1) who I suppose is one of your Committee, on the Subject of printing the Articles of Confederation. I have done & am doing all I can in that Business but the Printer, on this as on all other Occasions, is tedious beyond all possibility of being hurried.(2) I have yet seen but the first sheet, which is printed off & there will be six in all. He encourages me to hope that he will dispatch one of these sheets every Day. What can I do? I had rather be a Hogg-driver than attend his press; but will do what I can to forward the Work.  Mr. Marchant tells me that Virginia has limited herself to the Ohio. I am glad to hear it. That Puts an End to the Subject of my last;(3) at least in a great Measure.  Things look gloomy enough below. We want a General; thousands of Lives & Millions of Property are yearly sacrificed to the Insufficiency of our Commander in Chief. Two Battles he has lost for us by two such Blunders as might have disgraced a Soldier of three Months Standing: and yet we are so attached to this Man that I fear we shall rather sink with him than throw him off our Shoulders. And sink we must under his Management. Such Feebleness & Want of Authority, such Confusion & Want of Discipline, such Waste, such Destruction will exhaust the Wealth of both the Indies & annihilate the Armies of all Europe & Asia. Twenty Thousand Recruits annually would be absolutely necessary to maintain an Army of forty thousand. I believe this is the most moderate Calculation. In the mean Time People are so disaffected to the Service that no more Recruits can be got. In short, I am quite a Convert to Abraham Clarkes Opinion; that we may talk of the Enemy's Cruelty as we will, but we have no greater Cruelty to complain of than the Management of our Army.  I am, Yours sincerely, (Jona. D. Sergeant)  P.S. Pray communicate to Mr. Duane the former part of this Letter. He does not even know that I have recd. the Confederation.

On Receipt hereof you are to engage five or six Boats such as have been usually employed in carrying Goods up the River, ship on board them Cargoes of the Stores assorted of all the different Articles. Take proper Receipts or Bills of lading and dispatch them as soon as possible. These Boats should not be deep laden. Moderate Cargoes to have them pretty buoyant will do best, they must all be well manned with careful resolute Men well attached to the American Cause & Interest, particularly the Patrons or Masters. They must also be well armed with Swivels or Cohorns and Muskets and found with sufficient Provisions. Mr. James Willing NOVEMBER 21, 1777  will return with these Boats and to him you may commit your Dispatches, also the superintending Care of the Goods. Perhaps the Govenor may be willing to send the Goods up under Spanish Protection as far as there are any of their Forts on the River.

  Dear Sir York Town Nov'mber 21t. 1777  Inclosed I send you a Copy of the Confederation the Eighth Article of which Respects Taxation and has given me great uneasiness as I cannot see any Justice in the Rule therein laid down, for proportioning the Several States with the Charges of the Present War. In the first place it appears to me that one third part of the welth of the Southern States which consists in negroes, is entirely left out and no Notice taken of them, in determining their ability to pay taxes, notwithstanding it is by them that they procure their wealth.(1) Neither are we to have any advantage of them in proportioning the Number of men to be drawn from the Several States to Carry on the war, that being fixed on the Number of white Inhabitants in each state, so that by their negroes being left at home, they Can till their lands and git Bread & Riches, while some other States may be greatly distressed. In the next place the wealth that is in Some States more than there is in others by no means fixes a Proportionable Value on the Lands in Such States, which if this be true Seems to Prove that the plan laid down by Congress is not just. These are my own thoughts on this head, but refer you to your own better Judgment on them. It seems to be the Sence of Congress, that if any of the articles of Confederation Should be thought hard of, or unequal to any of the States, that they will make a Representation of the Same to Congress, with the reasons of their disapprobation to Such articles, in order if Possible to give satisfaction and ease to each and every of the States. The time fixed on for the Several legislatures, to determine on these great Points is by some members thought too short but I make no doubt but they will take as much time to deliberate thereon as may be thought just and necessary.  General Washingtons head Quarters is at the Sixteen mile Stone from Philadelphia, where it has been for a month Past. Several strong detachments are further advanced some at Germantown & a Strong Pisquit at the Rising Sun abought 4 miles from Philadelphia. A Considerable reinforcement from the northern army are on their march and in a few days it is expected they will join general Washington.  Whether any thing will be attempted or no is very uncertain. Yesterday we had an account that Fort Mifflin was evacuated. To day it is Contradicted. Be it as it will our People have maintaind that Post with much gallantry, and have harrased the Enemy greatly.  November 22d.

  Sir, 21st November 1777. Immediately upon hearing of your Captivity, I wrote to Colonel John Laurens requesting him to make to you a tender of my Services in Money or by other means as far as duty to my Country would permit.(1) I then beleived you have been in General Washington's Camp & that my Letter would have found you there. Your favour of the 18th which came to hand this Evening Shews me you are at Reading. I beg you will now accept of such offers as are intimated above & inform me in what respect I can make your confinement tolerable. I speak to you as to a Gentleman & know you are too much a Man of honour to ask any thing which my own honour would oblige me to refuse.  I perceive your first application is that I may Interest my Self with General Washington in order to procure your Release by Exchange, of this I Shall think maturely & take the opinions of my friends & if proper will apply to Congress upon the occasion. In the mean time I apprehend a Letter from your Self directed to Lord Howe or the Commanding Officer of the British fleet Sent open under cover to His Excellency General Washington, requesting of Lord Howe to propose an equivalent for your dismission would be a proper first Step & I am very sure General Washington's humanity will do every act in the Case which he can think himself authorized to do.  You cannot be unacquainted with a demur to the Exchange of prisoners which took place some Months since & which we think is chargeable upon General Sir William Howe, that unlucky circumstance has hitherto been attended with more evils to the unfortunate  NOVEMBER 21, 1777  Americans, than to the other party, these, such of them I mean as by the fortune of War have been made prisoners, have experienced not only humanity but very great Indulgence, while our people, Officers & Men, who have been made Captives, have in general been treated with such Cruelty as you are not answerable for & therefore I will not insult you with a detail or complaint of particulars. The ground on which I have given you this Slight intimation I may inform you of at a future opportunity. The Stoppage of the Cartel which was formerly in motion did not Seem to have extended to Sea Officers & Men, an Officer of a Carolina private Vessel of War & one of his Servants who had been exchanged between New York & Boston long Since the Subsisting dispute which I have alluded to, lately passed through this Town on their way home. This may afford Some ground for your address to Lord Howe & possibly the Name of Capt Manly in return for your Self may be very acceptable to us. But this is merely my own opinion & the effects of my good wishes to you, that you may upon adequate considerations obtain enlargement & be restored to your family. I know you are as little of an Enemy to the public in America as your honour & function will allow you to be.

  Dear Sir York Town Novr. 21st. 1777. I have to acknowledge yr. favour of Octr. 12th in which was inclosed the list of Numbers of the Tickets lost by me the l9th of Sepr. I have sent it to Baltimore to be published; and, as Messrs. Adams were going to Boston I have given a copy to them to be published in the Boston Papers. If you can persuade yr. Printer to republish the Advertizemt. in his Paper pro bono publico, I wish it may be done. But as I have an almost absolute certainty that a Pick pocket is the possessor of the Articles lost I hardly think it worth while to go on to spend money about notifications at such a Distance from the Scene of Theft. The utmost I expect is to prevent the Public being cheated by purchasing the Tickets.  I have nothing agreeable to tell you from this Quarter of the Continent. The Spirit of Enterprize is a Stranger in the main Army. You may expect so long as the War continues that 3 times more men will be lost in the main army by marching and countermarching over hills and thro' rivers than in battles. I should deceive you greatly if I lead you to look for any Thing favourable from the main army.  Fort Mifflin is lost after the bravest defence. The naval part of our Forces behaves well. They tell us from the grand army that our Gallies still maintain their Places of Command over the Cheveaux de Frize. The naval Force has not been seconded by proper Exertions on Shore. I am vexed, not without Reason; you will be so too 20 Times during this coming winter from the Accounts which you will have from the neighbourhood of Philadelphia. Great Part of our northern army is coming this way to be kept idle; except so much action may be allowed as will serve to wear out Shoes and Stockings. I have reason to think the Battle of Germantown was the day of  NOVEMBER 22, 1777  Salvation offered by Heaven to us, and that such another is not to be looked for in ten Campaigns.

All the news I can collect I have by this opportunity conveyed to the Honourable Council of Safety. As it will fall, of course, into your hands, it is needless to repeat the intelligence. You soon will receive the Confederation, with an address to convene the several Legislatures to ratify it; and a plan of taxation, and for supplying the army on more reasonable terms. The wealth of the Indies would not support the war, as it is now conducted. Indeed, it is impossible longer to gratify the avidity of the people, who set no bounds to their sharping and extortion.  Mr. Morris has not yet made his appearance, nor Mr. Lewis. I must have patience, for I dare not, in the present circumstances, leave our State unrepresented. My heart bleeds for the misfortunes of our friends of Kingston, and the eastern shore. Our implacable enemies seem to have taken leave of the feelings of humanity, and to exult in a predatory war, which would disgrace the fiercest savages.

The enemy got up their cut down Indiaman, fortified among other heavy cannon, with ten 42 pounders, and placed her between Fort Mifflin and Province island. Their capital ships at the same time were brought NOVEMBER 22, 1777  up within a mile, and with two batteries (one within 500 yards,) they sent a torrent of fire into the fort, and for a whole day and night there was a continual blaze. This completed the destruction of the fort; the men were besides unable to stand to their guns being picked off from the Indiaman's tops; and finally after every effort becoming heroes they evacuated it in the night.

  My dear Sir, York the 23d Novr. 1777 I need not make an apology for my paper because you know our choice of things here is confined within narrow bounds, as little occasion is there to excuse the slovenly manner in which this letter may be written, since you well know how seldom it is that we can command time in this busy scene. I had the pleasure of writing you lately by Capt. Romane, a young gentleman of worth who passes thro Boston in his return to his own Country.(1) Since that letter was written we have lost fort Mifflin, which our brave garrison was  NOVEMBER 23, 1777  obliged to abandon after a most gallant defence, in which all their guns were dismounted but two, and all the works beaten away to about a rod and a half. The enemy brought up their cutdown Indiaman between Province & Mud Islands and lay within Musket shot of the Fort upon which they discharged a most furious cannonade with 24 & 32 pounders, and from Cohorns and Musketry in their Tops, drove the Men from their guns. 'Tis said the Gallies did not do their duty. Notwithstanding this, it is the opinion of many that the enemy will not be able to get their fleet up to the City, unless they can get red bank, which, with the Gallies may yet prevent their raising the Chevaux de Frize. To remove this obstruction, we hear they have passed 3000 men over at Coopers ferry, and Cornwallis has crossed from Chester with 1500 more. Our force to oppose him is Brigadier Varnum's brigade of 1200, 4 regiments in Red Bank fort with the Garrison of Fort Mifflin, and Huntingtons Brigade lately sent over. We understand that the Army has moved down upon the enemies lines in consequence of their weakness by these powerful detachments. Thus we daily expect some interesting event. The confederation is not yet returned from press but we expect it will in a day or two when it will be sent forward, and with it will come this letter. We have strongly pressed the speedy consideration and return of the Confederation and we have urged the necessity of immediate and extensive Taxation, regulation of prices, and other measures of finance, ceconomy, and effectual recruiting the army.(2) I know my friend Mr. John Adams will say the regulation of prices wont do. I agree it will not singly answer and I know that Taxation with (Economy are the radical cures. But I also know that the best Physicians sometimes attend to Symptons, apply palliatives, and under favor of the Truce thus obtained, introduce (radical cures) cause removing Medicines. Let us for a moment check the enormity of the evil by this method, whilst the other more sure, but more slow methods secure us against a return of the mischief. The middle & southern States (particularly the insatiable avarice of Pennsylvania) having refused to join in the plan formerly, rendered the experiment on your part inconclusive and partial; therefore I do not think Mr. Adams's argument drawn from that trial quite decisive against the measure. I incline to think that the necessity of the case will now procure its adoption universally, and then we shall see what great things may be effected by common consent. The American conduct has already shattered and overset the conclusions of the best Theorists, and I hope this will be another instance. Two days ago I moved the immediate recall of Mr. Deane, which was agreed without dissent, and tomorrow is appointed for choosing a Commissioner in his place.(3) Our friends Mr. John Adams & Mr. Denny (4) are in Nomination, with some others. This appointment was strongly pressed on me in Congress, but my dear friend, rigid as you are in these matters,  I am sure you would have admitted my apology. I feel the obligations of public duty very powerfully, but when these duties can be better discharged by others, why may not the private ones be suffered to prevail? Why may not chari liberi have their weight, when such a sacrifice is not necessary for the public service. I remember that in some points our opinion differed respecting Mr. Deane, but I feel myself obliged to think that he has pursued his best judgment for the good of his Country when he made those distressing contracts, and perhaps his peculiar situation compelled him to carry them further than he might otherwise have done. Be this as it may, after Congress had so strongly determined concerning these, it would have been out of all character to have continued him. Yet this is a matter of great delicacy and I am not well satisfied with the whole of it. If our friend Mr. Adams should be chosen, I have earnest hopes that he will accept. The loss of time that will attend his refusal, independant of other considerations, renders it of much consequence that he should not refuse. Yesterday evening brought us a letter from Mr. Bingham covering one from Mr. Carmichael dated Paris June the 25 which containes the following passages. \""Mr. Lee writes me he is on his return from Berlin having finished his business successfully. If our enemies are not successful they mean to close with us on the best terms they can, sensible that if this great effort does not succeed, they have little to hope in future. This is an animating reason for us to preserve in the glorious contest. The English have compleated their loan amongst themselves. No foreigners have assisted them, altho the terms to the Lender are better than any ever yet offered by that Nation except once. Foreigners know that they have yet several millions to fund for which they must offer still better terms. The Spaniards have refused the mediation of France & England in their dispute with Portugal, being determined to prosecute the war until Portugal makes reparation and demands peace. They have taken the important Island of St. Catharine on the coast of Brazil without loss & mean vigorously to prosecute their operations on the Brazils. This I have from undoubted authority, one of the family Ministers. An account prevails that the Indians of the east have fallen on their Oppressors & have taken Madrass. India Stock has fallen in consequence of this. Both France & Spain continue their Armaments, as if preparing for some great event. This obliges England to do the same. Of course all their Naval & Army Contracts are for (5) years and they employ as many Work men in the Dock yards as they did in the last War. From this circumstance you may judge, however different their declarations may be in Parliament, they have real apprehensions from this Court & that of Spain. It would render our negotiations with Prussia more successful, if a Tobacco Ship could by any means be pushed into Embden, which Ship might make her returns in Manufactures necessary for   us at 15 or 20 per cent cheaper than we can have them here. Capts. Weeks, Johnson, & Nicholson have just destroyed 16 Vessels on the English & Irish coasts. I am dispatching Conynghame from hence on the same business. I begin to think War unavoidable.\"" Signed Carmichael  Mr. Binghams letter covering the above is dated Octr. 13th and contains the following important intelligence. \""The General received a few days ago by a packet from Rochelle 4th Septr. the following intelligence. That a Courier had been dispatched with instructions to the French Ambassador in London to claim all French Vessels captured (without the limits settled by treaty to bound the approach of French Vessels to the coast of British America) by the English, which have been regularly cleared out for any French Ports, which requisition if not complied with, is to be the signal for leaving the British Court. The General has received orders to put every thing in readiness for war and to lay an Embargo on all Ships destined for Europe to prevent their falling into the enemies hands. The Minister informs the General that Transports are already engaged at Havre, Nants, & Bourdeaux for the transportation of 5000 additional troops to Martinique and Guadaloupe. At Brest, Rochford, and Toulon they work night and day, & the greatest preparations are making for the immediate commencement of hostilities. The Generals plan is immediately to attack the English Islands, as his success depends on conducting his operations with such rapidity as to hinder any relief from being thrown in. The restitution of the Ship Seine & her Cargo is loudly demanded by the Court of Versailles. I mentioned in a former letter that Portugal had detached herself from the interests of Great Britain & had entered into the family Compact. Authentic advices mention that the King of Prussia has opened his Ports to the Americas.\"" Wm. Bingham  The union of Portugal with the Bourbon compact is a most injurious affair for England, to which that wealthy Kingdom was a kind of Colony. This event has, I presume, been brought about by the success of the Spanish Arms in South America, by the death of the King of Portugal, and by the incapacity of England to assist her Ally. The above intelligence makes immediate war extremely probable in Europe. But the meanness of the Court of London will stoop to every thing rather than endanger success in trampling upon the liberties of North America. Perhaps the British Ministry begin to see the necessity of setting Europe on fire, that the Smoke may conceal them from the eyes of their injured Country. Gen. Mifflin has been here, and he urges strongly the necessity of having Gen. Gates to be President of the New Board of War. He thinks the Military knowledge and the Authority of Gates necessary to procure the indispensable changes in our Army.5 I believe he is right. The capital  business of Congress for this winter is now over, and my ill state of health calls loudly for rest. I shall therefore withdraw in 8 or 10 days until the last of winter. I hope you will not forget to favor me frequently with the intelligence of your place. Where I am going is in absolute retirement, and will render more agreeable the news of the world. Your situation is one of the best and most frequent information I have now written you a long letter, one that might perhaps be construed trespass by any but a friend, I shall therefore conclude with assurances of my affectionate regard.  Richard Henry Lee P.S. I formerly desired you might direct for me to the care of James Hunter Esqr. near Fredericksburg, but for the future the following will answer better: R. H.

  My dear Sir, York the 24th Novr. 1777 I am just favored with yours of the 14th and thank you for it.(1) Every attempt to clothe the army is commendable, upon principles both of humanity and policy. As there is great Trade at Charles Town you have some chance for the woolens you want, altho this is the worst season for application on account of the many negroes they have to clothe in that Country. Either the Havannah or New Orleans are places where you may surely get Woolens and military Stores. Doctor Lee's letters have repeatedly assured us that at these places would be lodged the above articles for N America in general, and Virginia in particular. Small swift sailing Vessels sent to the former of these places from Virginia or North Carolina freighted with fine flour or Tobacco would not fail to return loaded with necessaries, and by pushing into some of the inlets on the Sea Cost of North Carolina might avoid the British Cruisers that infest our Bay and the goods be safely brot overland. This appears to me the most expeditious and the most certain way. By this method, the blankets & cloaths might yet be in Season to help the Soldiers before the winter is over. With respect to the loan of money at the Havannah or N. Orleans, I am not able to form a judgement whether it can be effected or not, the latter most probably, because Dr. Lee was able to get but a small sum immediately from Spain for Congress, altho he expected a larger credit from Holland thro the mediation and security of Spain. Add to this the great probability of immediate war in Europe, from which Spain will not be detached. I remember Dr. Lee in many of his letters to me previaus to his visit to Spain said he should endeavor to negotiate a loan from that Court for Virginia & (Maryland) South Carolina to support (as he said) the credit of our paper money. Since his return from Spain he only mentions Cloaths & military Stores that wd. be lodged at Havannah & Orleans for our use. For the purpose of securing the credit of our money on a great emergence it were to be wished a credit could be obtained as you propose, and therefore I think it will not be amiss  NOVEMBER 24, 1777  to make the experiment. As for goods they may be had in the way of Barter. Indeed, I understood Dr. Lee, that the military Stores and Cloathing would be delivered without immediate pay of any kind. We formerly sent you the [extract] of a letter on this subject to Congress, which is all that [has] been received, unless it be a Spanish letter from the Governor of N. Orleans which Mr. Morris took away to get translated, and it has not yet been returned.(2) You shall have it when we get it. Monsr. Loyeaute declines the Directorship of the Academy. He is a young Gentleman of high family, of fortune, and ardent in pursuit of military glory. His father, who is a general in the Artillery of France has taken pains to instruct this his Son from his earliest youth, and he is, you may be assured, a Proficient. He is sober, temperate as a Soldier should be, and seems to have none of the fashionable vices. He says he came not here for Money, but to search for military honor, to assist America in establishing her freedom, but since he cannot be employed on that way, he shall return to his own Country, the business of an Acadenuecian better suiting Age & infirmity with views of distant good, than youth, strength, and prospect of present action and immediate benefit to the public. I am concerned we [have] lost this Gentleman in many accounts. I am sure my Country will suffer for want of the knowledge he possesses and the rejection of him happened at an unlucky Crisis. All the rest of his Corps had just set out on their return to France because Congress would not comply with the Contact Mr Deane had firmly made with them in France and which had disgusted them greatly. This Gentleman remained at our request, and altho our engagement was not absolute, it was very strong, kept him from returning with his companions, and will I fear impress on all their minds bad ideas of the Americans and do us no service in France. This is well known here & the Delegates look rather small in the eyes of their brethren. I am sure we acted for the best, well knowing the utter deficiency of knowledge in this branch with us, its necessity, and having the best grounds for believing this Gentleman an Adept. It is certain we went rather too far, I am sorry for it, but we shall be less forward in future. Since I last wrote, the enemy have taken Fort Island, after a most gallant defence on the part of the Garrison, which retreated from the Island in the Night after all but two of their Guns were dismounted, and not [more than] a rod & an half of the works left. The enemy brought [up] their Cutdown Indiaman between Province Island & the [fort] from which they poured a most dreadful Cannonade from 24 & 32 pounders, and from their Tops the fire of Cohorns & Musketry drove the Men from their guns in the Fort. The better opinion yet is, that the Enemy cannot get ther Fleet up to the City until they first remove the Gallies, the Chevaux de Frize, and reduce Red Bank. To effect this latter purpose, we hear that Cornwallis with [3000] Men has crossed into the  Jersies, and that our Army is gone down to attack their lines now weakened by such a powerful reenforcement sent away. If so, we may expect important news in a day or two. One Brigade from the Eastern Army, with Morgans Corps have lately joined Gen. Washington. 20 Regiments are ordered from Gate's Army. The Rhode Island Expedition went no further than Providence by the Misconduct, 'tis said, of old Spencer. There will be an enquiry. Our last intelligence from the West Indies which covers news from France the 4th of Septr. gives us abundant reason to think that a War between France and G. Britain is on the verge of taking place if it has not already done so. The Fr. Amb[assado]r is ordered to demand all F. Vessels taken by England without the limits prescribed by Treaty, and to retire from the Court if the demand was not complied with. The Governors in the F. Islands are ordered to be in readiness for war and to lay an Embargo on all Vessels bound to Europe to prevent their falling into the enemies hands. 5000 additional Troops are to be immediately sent to Martinique & Guadaloupe. Portugal has acceeded to the Family Compact. Dr. Lee is returning from Prussia havg. finished his business successfully at that Court. The King of Prussia has opened his Ports to the Vessels of the United States, and Mr. Carmichael writes that a ship loaded with Tobacco to Embden would be attended with [salutary?] consequences. The Cargo would be returned in [manu]factures very usefull to us, and 15 or 20 per cent cheaper than from France. Cant we try this experiment at the proper Season which may be known by the Commercial Dictionaries. We expect daily to receive important news from Europe. My ill state of health, produced by bad water, bad air and excessive business will compel me to return home in a few days for the severity of the winter Season.  I am, with sentiments of affectionate [esteem and] regard, dear Sir yours, Richard Henry Lee  ""

  Dear Sir (1) York the 24th of November 1777.  I am much obliged to you for your favor of the 3d which I should have answered sooner if I had not been prevented by ill health and very much business.  NOVEMBER 24, 1777  The surrender of Burgoyne is no doubt of great consequence to our righteous cause, and I could wish it were in my power to entertain hopes of a similar event at Philadelphia. Howe has made his situation very strong by double lines and these strongly fortified. They do also contrive to get provisions up from the fleet in small Vessels by means of a channel between Province Island & Fort Island. The latter of these places having lately fallen into their hands will facilitate this business exceedingly. Yet the better opinion is, that the fleet cannot get up so long as we hold Red Bank, and the Cheveaux de Frize remain covered by the gallies. To reduce the former we hear that Cornwallis lately crossed the Delaware with 3000 men. We are very strong at that place, fully so I hope to give his Lordship a sound drubbing. We every day expect important news from thence.  We have just received a letter from Mr. Bingham at Martinique, covering one from Mr. Carmichael at Paris dated June 25 & July 6. Mr. Bingham's letter is dated the 13th of October. Mr. Carmichael tells us that Dr. Lee is returning from Berlin having finished his business successfully at the Court of Prussia. That the English could get no foreigners to assist making up their last Loan, altho' the terms were higher than usual. That 'twas reported Madrass had been taken by the Natives, which had fallen India Stock. That France, Spain, & England were preparing with all possible dispatch for War, and that he thought it was inevitable. Mr. Bingham says the General of Martinique had just received information from the French Ministry Sept 4 that demand was made upon England for a delivery of all the French Vessels captured by the English without the limits prescribed by treaty for bounding the approach of foreign Vessels to the Shores of British America, and if this demand was not complied with the Ambassador was to leave the Court of London. That the General had orders to put the Island in a posture for immediate war, and to prevent the sailing of all Ships bound to Europe by Embargo least they should fall into the enemies hands. Five thousand troops were immediately to be sent to Martinique & Guadaloupe additional to those already there. Mr. Bingham further informs that the Ministerial Writers in England were endeavouring to raise the National cry for a War with France, meaning to secure personal safety at the risk of National ruin. Thus these desperately wicked men are for setting Europe on fire that the Smoke may cover them from the vengeance of their injured Country. These are good presages for us but yet I cannot help being astonished at the horrid iniquity of these Wretches. We have finished the Confederation and it will go forward to the States in a few days, with strong exhortation to consider and return it quickly. In this great business dear Sir we must yield a little to each other, and not rigidly insist on having every thing correspondent to the partial views of every State. On such  terms we can never confederate. If we take a view of the World, we shall find that numbers are by no means a just criterion to fix the relative riches of States.(2) Of old times take Tyre and Scythia, Germany and Carthage. In Modern look at Holland & Poland, England & Germany. But the truth is, that let wealth flow into a Country from whatever source, it will forever reflect value on the lands of that Country and they rise in value in proportion to the influx of wealth. Thus the value of lands in England has doubled & tripled as commerce has brought wealth into the Island. For my own part, I doubt extremely whether Virginia will not pay more by the present Mode than if it had been determinable by numbers. But I am satisfied that the mode now fixt is the most just, and so fiat justicia, ruat coelum. We have recommended extensive taxation, sinking the provincial currencies, and regulating prices. I think that if the States will vigorously execute the recommendations of Congress, we shall, under providence, be a safe and happy people.  My ill state of health will compel me soon to return home for the winter season. I shall be particularly happy to hear from you, as well before as after you get to Congress, and for this purpose you will please direct to me at Chantilly Westmoreland County, to the care of the Post Master at Leeds Town in King George County Virginia. I live at some distance from the line of Post, and therefore propose to send weekly to the Office for such letters as my friends may favour me with.  I am, with sentiments of esteem and regard, Sir your most obedient Servant, Richard Henry Lee  P.S. I am sorry that my predictions about Red Bank have not been fulfilled. Cornwallis got up before our reinforcements arrived, which has occasioned the evacuation of that Post, and the Continental Vessels that were there have been destroyed to prevent their falling into the enemies hands.(3) We understand that the Stores at the Fort were saved & the Cannon spiked. Gen. Green is in the Jersies and he is very strong in Men, but whether there will be fighting nevertheless is to be determined by events. It does not seem clear that the enemy will get their Ships up because it is not certain they can remove the Cheveaux de Frize at this inclement Season. R.H. Lee  ""

4521,dg008297,1777,Richard Henry Lee to John Page,"""Richard Henry Lee to John Page
  My dear Sir.(1) York, Nov. 25th, 1777. I shall endeavour to answer your several queries concerning Gen. De Borre, but in the first place permit me to lay down a certain general principle by which I am actuated.(2)  To counteract by all prudent and possible means a certain rage against foreigners that has unhappily possessed the American mind, and which I fear will injure our cause extremely in Europe.  Gen. De Borre is certainly an officer of rank and old service in France, and I believe of more military knowledge than many 10 Continentals Generals that I could mention. It is not true that any real misconduct at Brandywine occasioned the proceedings against him that happened in Congress. The matter stands thus. The Maryland troops behaved ill that day, and their advocate, Mr. Chace, with some other noisy members, attributed the cause to the insufficiency of Generals Sullivan and De Borre. Many aspersions was thrown on the characters of both these officers, and they were both ordered before a Court of Inquiry. The former passed through his  NOVEMBER 25, 1777  trial, and has been acquitted with much honor. The latter being old, passionate and fractious, was so disturbed that he, without knowing the consequences, hastily resigned. His enemies were satisfied, since all that they wanted was to remove him from the army. It is true that he afterwards desired the rank of Major General, but this is rather a fashion of his country than vice in the man. Eager after military honors, nothing stops their pursuit. I am of opinion that there is no person who can now produce any fact against the reputation of this gentleman. And therefore I might well say that he was rather unfortunate. Wishing him to return to his own country as little hurt with our treatment as possible, and knowing that he was to pass thro Williamsburg, I gave him the letter which has fortunately produced your civil notice of him. You do not mention Monsieur Balford [Valfort], to whom I gave a letter also, as he thought of visiting you on his way to Charles Town. This gentleman is of singular worth, and far above the action of our little paltry American Wits, who think it so clever to insult foreigners with their silly attempts at ridicule. It is certainly wise, dear sir, to be guarded against impositions from foreign Adventurers, but it is equally unwise to cast into one undistinguished group all of other countries, without distinguishing the good from the bad. This is a remnant of English unsociability and self sufficiency, which it becomes us now to get rid of as quickly as possible. In a former letter you desire to know my reasons for contending against Maj. Butler that Ticonderoga was an important post, and you concluded it was for the sake of argument.(3) I am not fond of such practice, and consider it the product of vanity or idle amusement. The truth is that Ticonderoga in its modern sense, being the place where the French fortified on the West side of Lake Champlain, is not a place of consequence, altho Mount Independence, opposite it on the East side, is a very important Post. It was seen that the former might fall, as it was not a very good situation, and required a great number of men to hold it, while Independence was very tenable by a much inferior force, and really of more consequence. It was judged proper to guard the public mind against false conclusions in case of advancements, and therefore it was that I more than once in public contended for the same thing that I then did with Maj. Butler. Ticonderoga in the Indian language signifies the congregation of many waters, and comprehends the whole district, but the modern meaning of the word is the old French fort. I will not trouble you here with a minute recital of the foreign intelligence we have received. Suffice it to say that a war between France and G.B. seems inevitable immediate. Its certain that all homeward bound French West Indiamen are stopt Embargo to prevent their falling into the enemies hands. The French General has been ordered to put his hands into immediate state of defence, and is assured that 5000 additional troops shall directly be sent over.  Portugal has acceded to the family compact. Prussia has opened his ports to the Americans. M[adras] it is reported has been taken from the English by the natives. No foreigners would meddle with the last Parliament loan, altho the inducements were greater than usual. These are all favorable circumstances, yet we stand on precarious ground without immediate and extensive taxation, great economy, and wise attention to our military defences. How does it happen, my dear Sir, that the Barges of the men of war take our vessels at the mouths of our rivers, when we incur so great an expense in Gallies? These vessels, instead of being constantly at the mouths of the respective rivers, and the best of them in the Bay, looking the men of war in the face, are generally far distant in some snug creek or harbor, living at ease and diverting themselves on shore. This will not do. Our marines must be better managed, I am glad to hear we have got an able Engineer, and hope no time will be lost in strengthening and securing our harbors and rivers. Accessible as we are by water, this is of great consequence. Mons. Loyeaute declines the command of the Academy. He says that military honors and a desire to help secure the liberties of America by immediate action, not the desire of money, brot him to America. If he can't be in the War, he will return to his own country. His father is a General of estimation in the Artillery of France, and has taken pains with the education of his son, who is sensible, well bred, and an able officer in the Artillery branch; but we have lost him, and I hope the person prefered to him in the command of our Regiment will be able to serve the public. I am sure we want such knowledge extremely, and unless skillful men are appointed to the principal commands in that Regiment, how shall the great expense it will create be compensated by real utility?  Bad water, bad air, and bad every thing else, joined to excessive business, have injured my health and compels me to go home for the winter season. When I am at Chantilly I shall be glad to hear from you when you are most at leisure, or when any important news shall reach you.

Colonel Fleury a Brevet Certifying his Rank.(3)  This will go by the hand of a Brother of Simpers who was well spoken of in Congress by Mr. Rumsey from Maryland. The poor Man so deeply Interested himself in his Brothers Case as leaves no room to doubt his waiting upon Your Excellency with more than the dispatch of our ordinary Messengers.

  Dear sir York in Pennsylvania Novr. 27. 1777  Congress have lately established a new Board of War, upon a Salary of 2000 Dollars per Year for each Member. General Gates is appointed president, General Mifflin, Colo Trumbull, Colo Pickering, & Mr Peters are Members. Three of the Gentlemen have accepted, there remain but two to give their Answers, General Gates & yourself. I doubt not, that the first will be in the affirmative, & hope that You will follow the Example, as thereby a prospect will be afforded of introducing (Economy & Discipline into our Army, & affairs in general, without which America cannot be free & happy.(1) You was unanimously appointed, & from the Experience wch Gentlemen have had since You left the Department of Commissary General, of the Incompetency of their Friends to fill the Office, I doubt not that You would have had the offer with the Power of Appointing, I form my opinion from the Temper of the House when it was proposed, the D C Generals of purchases, had You been here to have executed it, & there had been a Certainty of your Acceptance. I know not your Sentiments on the Matter, but however they may be, I most ardently wish that You may accept of this Appointment for many Reasons. Colo Reed was nominated & would have been appointed, had it not been known to Gentlemen, that your Situation with respect to each would not admit of your sitting together at the same Board. I think there is not the least Doubt of this Fact. Your own affairs need not interrupt your immediate Attendance, as the Super Intendance of all the Commissaries in the eastern & northern Department is with the Governor & Council of Connecticut, who may displace & appoint at pleasure, & can direct the issuing Commissaries to receive the provisions now on your Hands, & your Accounts may be settled without a constant Attendance on the Commissioners.  The succession of Errors wsh have taken place in the Commissary's Department, have reverberated on Congress, & had the Gentlemen Who were the Cause thereof been troubled with an Attention to the Business of rectifying them, I should not have regretted the Consequences, but this Burthen has unreasonably fell on those Who opposed the Errors from the begining, & there seems to be a general Conviction that the Business never will be carried on by some of the present officers.  The affairs of Congress go on to our utmost Wishes. Confederation is finished, a Tax of 5000000 on equitable principles is levied on the States, a recommendation to confiscate & make Sale of the Estates of Traitors is sent to each State, the Money to be invested in loan office Certificates, And hereafter appropriated by the respective States. Recommendations to the States to meet & fix the prices of Labour, internal produce, & Imports &c, to call in their Currency by  NOVEMBER 27, 1777  Loan or Taxes, to open Subscriptions for the Continental Loans in each Town & District under proper Regulations to aid the Loan offices, to supply with Cloathing the Officers of their respective Batalions, at prices proportioned to their Wages, Charging the Surplusage to the united States under suitable regulations, & to give Vigour to the execution of their Laws, are also past by Congress. I hope soon to see the Treasury Office upon a new Establishment, & that your Brother the P M General will be a Commissioner, his Salary is augmented to 125 Dollars per Month, but I think him too valuable for that office, altho it must be acknowledged an important one. By the latest Intelligence from abroad, a War between France & G Britain appears to be inevitable. The Enemy have obtained possession of Delaware River, from the Delay of the Army to support Fort Mifflin & Red Bank; I think that an Enquiry into this affair, & the Rhode Island Expedition will necessarily take place. I remain sir, with much Esteem yours Sincerely, E. Gerry.  P.S. If you decline this office, it must have all the Effects so far as it respects yourself of giving up the Cause; a Measure that my Friend will never consent to, after having endured greater Toils than may be expected in future.  General Stevens is broke for Drunkeness.(2) ""

  Dear General York 27 Novr. 1777.  I fear you will have condemned for wilful neglect of the last opportunity of writing to you by Express, but the accuracy of our new President, after the remissness which had been too often evident since my joining Congress, took me by surprise.  This present Carryer will perhaps throw you into a dilemma. We want you in different places, but most of all in a third which you are not called to ballance about. We want you most near Germantown.(1) Good God! what a Situation are we in! how different from what might have been justly expected! You will be astonished when you come to know accurately what numbers have at one time and another been collected near Philada. to wear out stockings, shoes and breeches. Depend upon it for every ten Soldiers placed under the Command of our Fabius 5 Recruits will be wanted annually during the war. The brave fellows at Fort Mifflin & Red Bank have despaired of Succour, and been obliged to quit. The naval departments have fallen into Circumstances of seeming disgrace. Come to the Board of War, if only for a short Season.(2)  I hope the last Express did not cause any Uneasiness to you, as the drift of the Proceedings of Congress was by no means intended to throw any slur on your acceptance of the Convention; But to come at a true idea of Burgoyne's Conduct.  We hear his men have behaved so as to oblige the Guards to fire upon them. This information however is not well authenticated.  Upon a motion made some time ago Genl. Schuyler is permitted to tarry & look after his private affairs, and St. Clair is permitted to do the same upon seing his name in a council of war at what is generally, by the inconsiderate, called the grand army. Since our Resolve was forwarded, I see Kalb, Knox and St. Clair are a council reporting for the Evacuation of Red Bank as incapable of bearing a Seige.  Such kind of Counsel seems to be the relish of this Quarter.  I expect you will judge me to be in a very sour humour. I am so. For if it was not for the defeat of Burgoyne and the strong Appearances of an European war, our Affairs are fabiused into a very disagreeable posture. Poor McDougal lays at the point of death. Conway has resigned and many spirited Officers are discouraged by an overbalance of languid Counsellors. There has indeed appear'd a little stroke of Discipline in the Dismission of Stevens and a number of inferior Culprits from the Service of the States. I wish this may have a suitable Effect upon Cowards, Thieves & Drunkards, for such are the Crimes which have caused the Dismissions above mentioned.  With affectionate Esteem, Yr. humble Servt,  James Lovell NOVEMBER 27, 1777  ""

  Sir. York in Pennsylva. Novr. 27th 1777. Conversing with Monsr Loyeaute, on the subject of what you are pleased to say the assembly have in contemplation for him, we find the plan quite the reverse of his wishes, and inconsistent with his ideas of being personally and quickly useful in the field. Of good family, and early trained to war by his father, who is a general in the Artillery of France, he wants to be in action, and hopes to acquire NOVEMBER 27, 1777  glory by the good services of himself and the Corps he shall instruct. The probability of the war going south next Campaign, and the character he had learnt of Virginia, made him readily agree with the views of the Delegates to remain behind his Companions who are returning to France, in expectation of serving our country by introducing the knowledge of Artillery, in a manner consistent with his ideas of military character. We may yet avail ourselves of this Gentleman's abilities as you will see by the enclosed proposition,(1) which we pray you, Sir, to lay before the honorable Houses. We have many reasons for wishing this plan may meet with approbation. Because we are well convinced of its public utility. Because of the generous cordiality with which this gentleman accorded with our proposals, contrary to earnest solicitations of his countrymen to the contrary, and of others who wanted him to go to other States, and whom he has offended by giving ours the preference. And because, lastly, he is here left behind the rest of his Corps, who were departed before your answer arrived here. As Monsr Loyeaute has been informed that the number of British Cruisers in the Bay of Boston renders it difficult to get safely out of that Harbour, he has agreed to accept the invitation of R.H. Lee to pass some time with him at Chantilly this winter, so that if the Houses accept his proffered service, a letter sent to him there, will occasion his immediate attendance in Williamsburg. He is of opinion that for the business of instruction it will be quite proper that we should be provided with six field pieces, and as there are many belonging to the Continent now laying idle at Charles Town, we have no doubt but that Congress will indulge our Commonwealth with six or eight pieces on application being made by desire of our Assembly.  We have the honor to be sir, your Excellency's most obedient and most humble servants,  Richard Henry Lee.  Jos. Jones.  Francis Lightfoot Lee. MS not found: reprinted from Henry, Patrick Henry, 3: 128-29.  1 Loyaute's proposition, which Lee copied and enclosed with this letter, is in Lee, Letters (Ballagh), 1:367-68.

  Sir York Town Novr 28th 1777 The Congress finding almost every department in the Army running into the greatest Confusion & disorder for want, as we apprehend of a proper Board Consisting of Gentn. well skilld in the Vari- NOVEMBER 28, 1777  ous departments & who can at least for some time Constantly attend to the immediate concerns of the Army, & our board of Warr hitherto Consisting of Members of Congress who could not be supposed to have a proper knowledge of the several departments, & beside had not time to attend to them, Congress have Unanimously Agreed to Constitute that Important Board & to have it consist of such Gentn whom they think have the greatest knowledge of the several departments & abilities to discern & discover from whence the disorders arise & how they may be remedied, have therefore made Choice of Majr. Genll Gates, Majr. Genll Mifflin, Coll. Pickering present Adjutant Genll., Mr Trumbull late Commissy Genll. & Mr Peters, who has heretofore been Secretary of the Board of Warr to Constitute that Board, Genll Gates to be President & who is also to be Continued Majr Genll & to Act as such in the Army As Occasion may require. The Salary is at present established at 2000 dollars per Annum. Some were for 3000, & not quite a Majority for 2500. But considering the times, & in hopes & expectation that our Currency will soon regain its Credit it was thought best not for an Establishment to exceed 2000, and had better if Necessary some other way make an allowance for extraordinary expences to the present board, than make an Establishment at this time tho just, could not afterwards be reduced if our money in a great measure regained its Credit, & believe tho not certain that Congress will generously consider the present board over & above the present Establishment. As to your appointment as One, it was without any Sollicitation of those you might call your Friends or any movements from them, but by the Unanimous Choice not only of every State but of every Individual member of Congress & every State except Jersey & Delaware not represented. Therefore I hope not withstanding your past feelings, your present Interest & Inclination to tarry at home, & retire among the common Mass of private Citizens; Yet that you have not so lost your strong attachment to your Country, their Interest & Defense as to refuse them your Assistance in this present critical Situation of our Affairs & of the State of the Army, as to refuse your Aid & Assistance without which & some of the Other Gentn at least we have every prospect of ruin & destruction at least to the Army if not to the Whole Country. Coll. Reed was in Nomination & believe would have been appointed instead of Mr. Peters but Congress really was so Intent to avail themselves of your services & knowing the former Altercation & that it was possible you could not set with him in the same board with that Harmony which ought to Subsist entirely omitted him on that Account & Voted for Mr. Peters that there might be no difficulty in your way of Attending. I sincerely wish leaving all other cares & business that you would Immediately hasten to this place, take your seat in the board for the present with the Other Gentn who will be pressed to Attend as soon as possible, &  hope by Spring or by the Opening the Next Campain that our several departments may be so reduced to Order and System as if you on Trial shall think best to resign your place, no doubt it may be done. I hope you have not yet Moved to Norwich. If you have or not if you think best leave Amelia with her Mother, but if your business is such, that she cannot leave Norwich if you keep any Store there which makes it Necessary, if you can find no body better, Oliver is a faithfull thorough ladd. You may call him off from where he is & place him there to take care of your Store in your Absence. This I only hint not knowing what your business is nor what help it will require. I readily percieve an Objection Arising from your Accounts with the publick you expect to settle this Winter, but that must be postponed, if Necessary for this service. I hope before this that your Stores eastward are either taken by Genll Heath or regularly delivered over as Congress have given every appointment Necessary both in the purchasing & Issuing department, to Govr Trumbull that there might be no failure in that quarter. As to Newes this way Nothing favourable. Inactivity & Confusion, a Naked Undisciplined Army, are the topicks of the day with us. We hope on the Junction of the Northern Troops a fairer prospect will open. Our Forts down the river have been oblidged to be Evacuated one after Another, Fort Mifflin first but not till it was all levelled by the Enemies Batteries & Ships. Fort Mercer at Red Bank soon followed for want of a seasonable reinforcement by Land on that side (when Lord Cornwallis pushd over with a large Detachment from Hows Army, joined by those from N York) or for want of a Vigorous push upon Genll How, when he had so much weakend his Army on this side the river. Our Gallies are now oblidged to retire up the river after setting fire to our larger Craft &c. The River now commanded by the Enemy, a Battle is supposed to have happened the Jersey side between Cornwallis & our Troops there (1) who were reinforced too late to save Red Bank by Genll Greens division in which was Genll Huntingtons Brigade. The Event we know not, hope favourable and do not quite despair of pushing Genll How from his quarters before winter is over. They now call for the brave New England boys who were with Genll Gates, but if they dont come this way hope they may plunder New York.  Rhode's Island blank & worse, an Enquiry will be made.(2) You were too true a prophet. News from Europe favourable, a French Warr with England apprehended Inevitable & soon if not before now taken place. He who guides the Wheels of Nature & over rules the Counsells of Men, may yet we trust divert the Storm. My kind regards to Wife & family & dear Amelia. Am yours,  E Dyer [P.S.] Let me hear from you on the Subject of this letter as soon as possible.

  Dear Sir, [November 28, 1777] (1) I shall not in my great hurry repeat to you any of the matters which I have written to Mr. S Adams (2) as you can have them, on sight of him.  I expected Brother Geary would have written to you but he has Just requested me to inclose two Letters which he opened in consequence of your orders; and to give his Compliments to you begging your excuse of his further silence as he is preparing to go on a Committee to Camp in the morning with Robt. Morris and Mr. Jones to have a confidential Conference with the General, which I hope will put an end to the Idea of retiring into winter quarters, an Idea too much entertained by our Military Officers. The Conference is to be with the General only.(3) I hope every exertion will be made in New England to lessen complaints abt. Cloathing. A rascally improvement is made of the charming appearance which some of our lately-arrived troops make in comparison of others. It is said that now it may be seen where the cloathing is that came in the Amphitrite. I mention this en passant to you. I shall write about it to camp as the malice of it deserves.  I am charged by all those who are truely anxious here for the best prosperity of our affairs in France to press your acceptance of the Commission which has this day been voted you. The great sacrifices which you have made of private happiness has encouraged them to hope you will undertake this new business. As one I hope that you will not allow the consideration of your partial defect in the NOVEMBER 28, 1777  Language to weigh any thing, when you surmount others of a different nature. Doctor Franklin's Age alarms us. We want one man of inflexible Integrity on that Embassy. We have made Carmichael Secretary who is master of the Language and well acquainted with the politics of several Courts. Mercantile matters will be quite in regular channels and so not a burthen to the Commissioners. Alderman Lee, Morris and Williams will have got our commerce into good order by the time of your arrival. If you make the Language any Argument to deter you, consider that you may perfectly master the Grammer on your voyage and gain much of the Speech too by having a genteel French man for a fellow Passenger. You see I am ripe in hope about your acceptance, however your dear amiable Partner may be tempted to condemn my Persuasions of you to distance yourself from her farther than Baltimore or York Town.  Great as Brother Geary's hurry is he threatens to take his pen in hand because I am not enough urgent with you; he feels all the Callosity of a Bachelor. I am but too ready to pardon his hard heartedness on this occasion where the eminent Interest of my Country is pleaded in excuse for him.  Tyconderoga & Independence evacuated give room for a revengeful exertion against our Enemies in this Quarter with fresh force from the northward. But this and every other favourable circumstances encreases our necessity of having a strict politician in France, as the probability of Treaties grows with our good Luck and lessens with our bad.  I will add no more than my Love and Respects to you & yours sincerely,(4) James Lovell  ""

There is now full conviction of what some of us, here, together with you, prophesied months ago; and agreable to a report of a committee appointed to consider of the Propriety of constituting a commissarial Board, Congress have determined to add a Gentleman to the new Board of War who might have a particular Superintendance of the Commissariate. Genl. Gates is chosen President, Mifflin, Pickering, yourself & Peters make up the Board.(1) The manner in which you have been chosen, both as to the assigned Grounds and the unanimity, is so honorary as not to leave you the chance of refusal, to say nothing of the determined and general Preference which has been openly given in Congress to you, by omitting one of the first named candidates;(2) who was also mentioned now again upon the proposed addition of two to the original number of 3, which had been intended to be a Board. I assure you that the Safety of our army is thought in a very great measure to depend upon your immediate acceptance. You will consider it as the first Board upon the continent; and, the Honor out of the Question, as a Place in which you can serve essentially your suffering Country, and I think serve it with less plague & anxiety than in yr. former condition.  If you should happen to be in Boston when this reaches you Mr. S.A. will communicate all I write to him. Our affairs are Fabiused into a confused situation, but yet by no means into a ruined one.  Genl. Stevens is dismissed with several inferior Officers by sentence of Court martial approved by Genl. Washington, which looks a little like firmness and rising Discipline.

But I hope it is not utterly too late. I mentioned in my last my apprehentions of the impossibility of maintaining the Forts &c on the river, which are most unhappily justifid, on the 15th Fort Miflin being torn all to peices & every Gun dismounted, & a most violent attack &c was abandoned, after as brave a defence as was ever made, the men &c saved. The Fall of Red Bank was then inevitable, Cornwallis pasd below with abt 2000 & met abt 2 or 3000 more lately from N York & preparing to storm, & it being vain & impossible to support it, the Garison retired the 20th, saved what they cod, spiked the Cannon &c & all our Shipping, Fire Craft &c &c save the Gallys, were burnt by their officers orders, some gally tis said as have run by the City. Maj Genl Baron De Kalb, sund[ry] other General Officers, beside Gen. Huntington with considerable Numbers, I guess not equal to the Enemy, were over & advancg to the relief of the Fort. There has been a very heavy Firing heard from that quarter since, probably an Engagement between them, the Event not known, probably of great import. God grant us good Tidings.

The plan was to have one versed in every Department, the Members are Genl Gates Presid, Gen. Miflin, Adj. Genl Pickering, Col Jos Trumbull, & R Peters Esq late Secrety. It is deemd of very great importance, as You will readily perceive by the Members appointed. The Sallery is 2000 Dols per An. & a struggle to get higher. & I have no doubt it will yet be raised & such fresh sums allowed as to satisfie the Members, if this dont. Bro Jos. has shewn so much inflexibility &c that I am not certain he will accept, I hope he will not rashly conclude against it, if he does I think he will injure his Country, & his own Character irremediably with Congress. It will also certainly be a disadvantage to your Self, & a Reflection on his Friends here &c & I think will be acting agst his duty to the Call of Providence. It is a Circumstance worthy of Note, that he had every Vote, & that Col Read was also in Nomination & was highly esteamed, but for the Quarrel between Them, obtaind but one Vote, so much did They prefer Mr Trumbull, to one who otherwise wod certainly have been chosen.  I have the sweet Satisfaction of knowing I have served my Country here with great Fidelity, & I hope to some good Purpose, & now the pleasing prospect of returning to my dear native Colony, who have employed better Servants.

The Department is of very great Moment most certainly, & never was or cod be properly executed by a Board consisting of Members of Congress, if for no other reason it was impossible to give proper Attention & Time to both, & They are most heartily weary of trying, & if I was not quiting Congress shod have some personal Interest, in the new Boards coming soon. The pay is 2000 Dols. to Each, & I have no doubt but additions will be made e'er long.  I much dislike the new Regulation of the Comissa Department, but had no doubt Alterations wod take place, as They have already & very likely may further as occasion & Experience may require & if you had continued in that, I verily believe you wod have your Country a very real & great Service, & that the Army has suffered exceedingly by the inexperience of the rear officers & it is a bad & wrong revenge to wound your already bleeding Country, to come up with Congress, for a great mistake in my opinion, but by far the most I doubt not come into with the best Intention.  If Jack had really an Inclination to have continued in the Army I have no doubt he might have obtained Justice in the matter he complained of & wod have done real Service,(1) & been also a Brigr. Genl. instead of Wilkinson, had his Life been spared, but enough. I hope to see you before you can set out hither, designing homeward, if Mr. Law dont delay me next Monday.

  Dear Wilson, Novr. 30th. 1777 I wish it was in my Power to send you more agreable Intelligence concerning your Capital than I can at this Time. Fort Mifflin after a gallant Defence has been evacuated; and Red Bank has shard the same Fate. To what Causes the last is to be imputed I cannot at present Inform you, but I am afraid that Timely measures were not persued to send over a Detachment to oppose a Body of about Four thousand with which Cornwallis had crossed over into Jersey. Since this Event the Enemy have got up several of their Vessells to the City. This is the black side of the Picture. The Reverse I relate with more Satisfaction. We have received certain Advice that the Enemy have Evacuated Fort Independence and Ticonderoga after having destroyd all the buildings and thrown the Cannon into the Lake (except the Eighteen), and have retired to the Isle au Noix and St. Johns. They have also dismantled Fort Independance near Kingsbridge in the State of New York, and withdrawn all their out Posts to York Island. This shews their weakness in that Quarter; and their Determination to apply their Force to hold Philadelphia. However it will enable us to bend our Attention to one Object; and I still flatter myself that we shall be able during the Winter to strike a bold Stroke agt Mr. Howe, though he is certainly well fortified in his Front and has lately received from New York a Reinforcement of about 2500 Men. A Committee of Congress has gone down to Head Quarters the Members of which are Mr. Robt. Morris, Mr. Jones, and Mr. Gerry. The Motive of their Embassy you will be at no Loss I imagine to determine.(1)  On Monday the Marquis de la Fayette with about four or five Hundred Men attack'd a Picquet of the Enemy in Jersey of about 300, drove thern, killed Several, and took twenty or thirty Prisoners. It is said he behaved with great Intrepedity; and I beleive with some Experience will make a good officer. NOVEMBER 30, 1777  You may depend on my paying Attention to what you about Arms, and that I will not quit Pensilvania without paying you a Visit. As I write in great haste you will forgive all my Inaccuracies.  I am very Sincerely, Yours, Wm. Duer  ""

  Sir, York State of Pennsylvania Nove. 30th. 1777 Mr. Marchant before this reaches you will have informed you of my safe Arrival here after a long Journey; and of every thing material that occured after his last Letter to you. The President hath transmitted to your Excellency printed Copies of the Confederation; any Articles of which that may need an Explanation Mr. Marchant will explain to the Assembly. The President hath also sent you all the recommendatory Resolves to the respective States which have passed since I have been here, which renders it unnecessary for me even to mention the heads of them. I will only observe that in the Report recommending a Tax of five Million Dollars to be laid on the United States our Quota was One hundred and twenty thousand Dollars; and that upon my representing the Circumstances of our State Twenty thousand were taken off and put upon Massachusetts.(1)  Congress have resolved that an Inquiry should be made into the Causes of the failure of the Rhode-Island Expedition, and the Conduct of the principal Officers concerned in it. The Mode for conducting the Inquiry is committed, and Report will soon be made.(2) Beside the public Benefit that may attend this Resolution it will be beneficial to our and the other States who furnished the Troops for that Expedition; for Congress by taking this Business in hand have by Implication acknowledged that the Continent is to bear the Expence of it.  The Scene of War is so much nearer to Providence than York Town that your Excellency cannot expect that I should give you any News from that Quarter. You will before this gets to hand have heard of the Evacuation of Forts Mifflin and Mercer. The former made a most obstinate Defence, the latter was evacuated upon the Approach of Lord Cornwallis with a Detachment of about 2000 Men from the main Army and a small Reinforcement, supposed to be from New York, which joined him at Billingsport. Genl. Washington upon hearing that Lord Cornwallis had crossed the Schuylkil, had ordered  NOVEMBER 30, 1777  Huntingdon's Brigade to cross the Delaware, and join Genl. Varnum who commanded at Red Bank, and the next Day Genl. Green with his Division marched with the same Design; but they were it seems too late. Genl. Washington wrote Congress that Genl. Varnum had wrote him that We had saved the chief Part of the Stores in Fort Mercer and all but the heavy Cannon, and that the Council of War judging that the Contl. Fleet could not escape after the Fort was evacuated, had ordered it to be and that it was burned.(3) The Express who bro't the Letters from Genl. Washington, giving the above Intelligence, says that there was a heavy firing in Jersey last Monday but that the Occasion of it was unknown when he left Head Quarters; and yesterday it was reported that there had been a battle between Genl Green & Cornwallis. Genl. Washington wrote that Genl. Greene would give him Battle if he could do it with any Probability of Success.(4)  By a Letter from Genl. Gates of the 16th Instant the Enemy had evacuated Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, carrying off all the Stores & Brass Cannon. They burned all the Buildings and sunk the Iron Cannon in the Lake. He writes too that the Enemy had abandoned all their Posts on the North River, and that they had retired or were retiring from Kings Bridge.  I hope that our Troops may be able to keep the Field this Winter. The Force that Genl. Washington hath with him, aided by the hardy Sons of New England and the Militia that might be collected in this Quarter and from the Southward, might intirely destroy Mr Howe's Army this Winter, In Expectation of which glorious Event I continue to be with great Respect, Yr Excellency's most obedient, humble Servant, Wm Ellery  P.S. In a Letter from G. Washington of the 26th Nove. he writes that he had just recd. the following Extract from a Letter from Genl. [Greene]. \""The Marquis Fayette with about 400 Militia & the Rifle Corps attacked the Enemies Picket last Evening, kill'd about 20, wounded many more and took about 20 pris[oner]s. The Marquis is charmed with the spirited Behaviour of the Militia & Rifle Corps. They drove the Enemy about half a Mile & kept the Ground, until dark. The Enemys Picket consisted of about 300 and were reinforced during the skirmish. The Marquis is determined to be in the Way of Danger.\""(5)  By the last Letter from France and by One from the W. Indias it appears that there is a great Prospect of Hostilities being soon commenced between France & Spain and Great Britain. I forgot to mention this Circumstance in the Body of my Letter. WE  ""

  Dr Sir York Pensylvania Novr. 30. 1777 Since my last by Mr. Gillon who has been detained much longer than was expected I have very little to ad, except an Authentic Account from Genl Gates of the Enemys evacuating Ticonderoga & all their Posts in that Quarter, they burnt all the Buildings & threw such of the Cannon as they could not Carry off; into the Lake. Genl. Green with about 5000 of the American Troops on Monday the 24 Instant we are informed had a Smart Engagement with about the same number of British on the Jersey side. Congress have as yet received no certain Intelligence of the event, We comfort ourselves with knowing that had Our Army been defeated we should have heard it before now. Genl. Howe we are informed has got 1 40-gun Ship & Several Transports up to Philadelphia as there is now Nothing on the River to Oppose them; some of Our Gallies & Other armed Vessels have got up the River above the City, such as they could not get up were burnt, the Loss of these Vessels is to be inquired into.  We are not without hopes of dislodging Genl. Howe from Philadelphia this winter notwithstanding the Series of misfortunes & disappointments which have attended our Army in this Quarter. One bold push may yet retrieve all. Genl Howe is apprehensive of this & is guarding all in his power against it. Could this Army be defeated, America is safe; Our whole Collective Strength ought to be imployed to effect this grand Purpose. By the next Opportunity I shall send you the Articles of Confederation, they are at last Compleated after being under the Consideration of Congress for Almost two Years; This has been the most difficult piece of Business that ever was undertaken by any Public Body, it is the best Confederacy that Could be formed, especially when we consider the Number of States, their different Interests, Customs &c &c. The Mode of Settling the Quota of Taxes to be paid towards the Common Expence is at last fixed by the Value of all Land held under Pattent or Deed in each  NOVEMBER 30, 1777  State. The Eastern people were much against this, knowing their Lands to be very Valuable, they were for settling the Quota by the Number of Inhabitants including Slaves, this would have ruined Poor No. Carolina, she has as many Inhabitants as Connecticut (almost) Tho the Land in that State would sell for five times as Much as the Lands in ours.  I have wrote to Mr. Jno. Mitchel to send Jackey to me, (1) there is a good School in this Town & I can have him under my own eye & will (please god I live) bring him home with me. If Mr. Mitchell should not be able to Effect this, I shall send for him. Let me know how Our Copartnership business goes on. I shall, I am afraid, have Occasion of a Bill for 2 or 300 pounds, I wish you would have one in readiness in Case I send for it. Ask Mr. Brice whither he could (or Tom Craike) undertake to purchase a Large Quantity of Pork this Season. I wish I could know what number of Barrels could be procured this winter in Our State & at what price. Tell those two Youngsters they are sad fellows not to write to me. Remember me kindly to all my friends, you know them better than I do. I expect you always shew my Scrawls to Mr. Quince, otherwise I should Steal an hour from business to write to him.  I am with esteem, Dr Sr, Your sincere friend & Obed Servt.  Cornl. Harnett [P.S.] I have wrote Mr. Fredk. Jones Senr. 2 Letter (2) relative to a Bill he sent by me, & have received no Answer. Perhaps he has not received them. Tell him Mr. Shoemaker declined receiving the money, I have it now in a Bundle Sealed up & will send it to him if he desires it, or you may pay it to him there as he chooses.

  My Dear son York Town 30th November 1777.  I beleive it was on Wednesday last I troubled you with 2 or 3 sides of Paper, a great deal of scribbling, to express very little.(1) Times are such with me as to leave none for reviewing or amending in any  NOVEMBER 30, 1777  Case, nor to Copy except Public Letters & in a few special concerns. The last 48 hours have been almost wholly employed at this Table in Congress, in that time I have had about 7 Hours sleep, I quitted the Pen at 10 oClock last Night & was at it again 1/2 past [ ] this morning. This was rather too much, I did not feel it, but apprehended it might be so, I stole to Bed again for two Hours but could not sleep. The Plan laid by Lord & General Howe for seizing Congress took full possession of my mind-neither in this Case did I fear, but being convinced of the Practicability of a successful enterprize of this importance, the mind was exercised in projects for guarding against the Evil. It would be an Evil to me individually of the first magnitude-little less would the mischief be to the States if the whole Representative should be carried off by the Enemy-however insignificant each Individual may be We are here Inmates with & surrounded by Enemies of the vilest hew. The Archives such as they are, the Treasury such as it is, are here, but we have no Troops here to guard either our persons or the property of 13 States. 50 Enterprizing Spirits aided by any Number they could collect here, & we are well assured they [. . .] the Enemy in your Neighborhood have obtained the offer of 500, the whole business might be done. Gold will secure them a passage across Susquehanna & the Mischief would be 24 or 36 hours old when you should have received the first intimation. You will ask if we are well assured of the fact of 500, why don't we take measures. We may have evidence sufficient to convince our minds, tho' inadequate [for] the convincing suspected Persons- but why have not we taken measures in many other momentous concerns. Why were we not as active in July to guard against the Inclemency of January as we affect to be now in November-now perhaps when too late to enable our Troops to keep the Field. I did not fail to speak my sentiments, & so far, which was far as I, almost unaided, could [go], to do my Duty-soon after my arrival in this Country-I spoke of means for guarding against the disaffected-of the necessity for providing Clothing by times-of the preservation of Delaware-of the ruinous State of our funds-of the amazing misconduct of dealing Money out by Millions to particular Persons, under those accursed four words-\""he to be accountable,\"" & totally neglect, I say totally neglect to demand Accounts. I should tire us both were I to proceed to say all I could on this topic. I will conclude for the present lamenting the fate of the few honest Men, among whom I class your General-but believe me there is a rottenness in Denmark, I have seen more than prognosticks.  I think we cannot fall, I am sure we shall not, unless it shall be by insidious hands. Our affairs are now at a Crisis, & sentence may be passed upon them for aught we know in a very few days-to our establishment or destruction. Let the Army you have break & disperse & depend upon it Independancy will be a term of Mockery for an   age to come. I won't say measures have been taken to disband that Army, but if that event had been in veiw better measures than those we have pursued could scarcely have been devised. Confine not your attention to a small Circle; look round & through your Army-but I have not time to say more-when shall we meet?  I send you a Copy of our Articles for confederation. I know you will Criticise as a Scholar & a Legislator & I shall be glad to receive your Ideas.  The dispatch of 3 Copies of these accompanied by proper Addresses & Letters to each State has engaged me so very deeply for 2 or 3 days past, as spoken of above. Without these Extra jobbs my hands & my mind are for their strength generally sufficiently employed.  I am now to thank you for your Intelligence under the 26th. The Marquis's first fruits from Command will be encouraging to his confidence in our Men, I rejoice at his success & if he is returned to Camp I beg you will present my Congratulations.(2) I would if it were possible write by this opportunity, I trust his indulgence to Credit me to the next.  Several Members of Congress who have called here this Morning to read General Washington's Letter of the 26th have expressed their wishes that the Marquis may be appointed to the Command of a division. Therefore I have no doubt when the Letter is Read & the subject considered tomorrow in Congress I shall be charged with a Resolve equal to the Marquis's wishes.(3) I cannot learn from all you have written nor from any Account the number of our little [fleet] that escaped-what Naval Strength if any we now keep in Delaware -& how they are or are not exposed to the Enemy's power. If you can tell me these things do-but I will endeavor to get information from the Navy Board at Bordentown.  I send by this bearer a hunting Shirt & a Check'd Shirt for Berry & hope this Week to get a Warm Jacket & Breeches for the poor old fellow but these are articles beyond conception dear, however the price shall be no Bar to my intentions.  Mrs. Hartley is just returned home. A new scene opens, my power & possessions will be reduced to former Limits rather scanty for a President however ample for Mr L. I was put in the Chair the day the Lady left home. I shall be a little puzzled either to get a better or to make this place as convenient as a place for my vocation ought to be.

I am thus far in my way, & shall depart in the morning for  DECEMBER 1, 1777  Camp, where I shall be glad to execute any of your commands. This expedition puts it out of my power to wait on the Council as I intended, in hopes of obtaining John Brown's discharge from close Confinement, for as I firmly believe him innocent in his Intentions, I cannot feel myself easy whilst he is confined in Goal.

My connections in business with Mr. Brown are well known; he was many years a faithfull servant in my employ, & is justly entitled to my Friendship. I hope, therefore, to stand excused by your Excellency & the Council for thus troubling you with my applications on his behalf, & if you will suffer Mr. Brown to come out on his parole & assign this place (with the liberty of one or two miles for exercise) for his abode untill your further pleasure; it is a retired part of the country, he can live at little expence, & I am certain his conduct & conversation will be such as cannot produce any evil consequences to the public; you will oblige me by laying this & Genl Washington's letter before the Council, & they by a complyance with my request, will lay a lasting obligation on their & your Excellency's, obedt hble servt, Rob't Morris  MS not found reprinted from Pa.

  (In Committee on Foreign Affairs) Gentlemen (Copy) York in Pensylvania Decr. 1st. 1777.  As we wish the subject of this letter to be well attended to & understood, we shall confine ourselves intirely to the business of such DECEMBER 1, 1777  French Gentlemen as have returned without getting employment in North America and particularly those of Monsr. du Coudray's Corps.  Whatever may be the Clamour excited by discontent, we think that a candid consideration of our circumstances, and what Congress have really done will fully justify them in the eyes of reasonable men. We will observe in the first place, that, of all those who have returned, not one came here at the request of Congress, that they have cost the states a very large sum of money, and, that the circumstances of affairs would not permit any benefit to be drawn from them here.  It was necessary, previous to the opening of the campaign that the affairs of the army should be arranged, officers appointed and every thing systematically made ready for the serious business that was approaching. At this time, it was not known by Congress or the Commander in chief, that such a character as Monsr. du Coudray (under such agreements as he brought with him) was to visit us. The best that could be done was therefore undertaken, and Genl. Knox, the father of the American Artillery, was appointed to that Command, and all the other divisions of the army filled with Major Generals.  In this state of things arrived Genl. du Coudray with an agreement by which he was to command the Artillery & the greater part of the major Generals of the army, by being of older commission. A plentiful crop of resignations began presently to sprout up; and the whole army must have been deranged & thrown into confusion just at the opening of a Campaign, or this agreement not accorded to in the whole. But Monsr. du Coudray would have every thing or nothing. An inflexible ambition, that paid no regard to the situation and circumstances of the army would be gratified. This produced a scene of contention wsh. was not ended, when the unfortunate General was drowned by accident in the Schuylkill going to join the army. Immediately on his death the rest of his Corps determined to return to France; and in this disposition of mind Congress endeavoured to render things agreable to them as possible, having some regard to the interest of the public which they serve.(1)  It is true that a concurrence of causes, such as removal from Philadelphia, the time that elapsed before business was regularly gone into again, and the multiplicity of public affairs &c did occasion some delay in settling with these Gentlemen, but this was loss to the community more than to them, because their pay was continued to the last; And you will see, by the papers inclosed, that ample allowances have been made for their expences to the shipping port for passage to France & travel to Paris.(2) It has been already observed that Monsr. Du Coudray's desire could not be complied with, without producing very injurious consequences. All the other Officers were offered admittance into the army according to the ranks stipulated   for with Mr. Deane; but, to avoid certain murmurs & discontent by difference of pay in the same army, they were offered the pay & rations of continental Officers of similar Rank. This they rejected; and when the mischief of dissimilar pay was removed by their determination to return to France, they were paid their Livres compleat, with all their Gratifications as agreed for, their expenses & passages being also fully satisfied.  Upon the whole, we beg leave to refer you to the inclosed papers for more minute information touching this business, where we think you will find documents sufficient to convince unprejudiced & reasonable men that Congress have done all they could or ought in duty to the publick to have done, for the entire satisfaction of these Gentlemen. And we hope you will be enabled thereby to counter operate any ill impressions that may be attempted to be made by some of these Officers. We say some because we believe that the more reasonable among them are satisfied.  We are with much Regard, Gentlemen, Your very humble Servants. Richd. Henry Lee  James Lovell ""

  Dear Sir,(1) York Town, December 1st. 1777. I have embraced the first Opportunity by Mr Hornby to let you know the present Situation of Congress. The Approach of Genl Howe towards Philadelphia obliged them to adjourn to this most disagreeable Town, where every thing is excessive dear & scarce any accommodation to be procured.  Since my arrival here,(2) I have not been able to get private Lodgings, so that I am at present quite irregular as to the mode of living, which makes me very uneasy.  With respect to the remittance you desired me to make to your Son in England, I have not as yet had it in my Power to fulfill your desires. The Capture of Philadelphia has prevented Mr Morris from attending Congress, with whom I proposed to negotiate this business; but a Circumstance occured last week, which I apprehend will enable me to do it with great ease. DECEMBER 1, 1777  Mr John Adams, who is now at Boston, was appointed one of our Commissioners at Paris, & is immediately to proceed there. I am told he will wait on Congress for his Instructions before his departure, if this should be the Case, I shall immediately do this business for you. If not, the first time Mr Morris attends here, I shall communicate the matter to him &c.  By Letters from our Agents abroad, there is great reason to expect a French War in the [Spring]. The Congress at present is very thin of Members, however I hope during this Winter they will make a spirited Exertion for the Salvation of the Continent. You may expect to hear some thing soon from Washington. Do write me every Opportunity.

I beg leave however to remark to my late Colleagues, that Congress before printing judged it proper to make Several essential alterations particularly in Article 9th parag. 2d, that I have therefore no cause to blush at the appearance of my name among the few Nays on the Original Vote, I should be Still better pleased to see that article undergo a little further amendment.(1)  That, for taking Yeas & Nay's is another Item to which I am marked in the Journal with a disgraceful No! & almost without a Companion.(2) I have never heard that question demanded, with that Calmness of mind which ought ever to accompany the debates of Senators, it has always been the product of heat & menace. Besides, however proper it might be to incorporate in the Rules of a House, it does not Strike me as a necessary ingredient for Confederation. It appears to be totally Irrelative to the grand Subject. I do not mean to comment by exposing this baggatelle. There are Articles of deeper Impression.  I have taken the Liberty to commit four packets directed for DECEMBER 1, 1777  Georgia to Your Excellency's protection, which I request may be immediately Sent forward by an express Messenger, the expence to be Continental. Captain Gillon's politeness in taking charge of all these bundles, will Save not only Money but time. He will travel more expeditiously at this Season of the year than I could expect any of our Common Expresses would do.  The loss of Delaware may be contrasted by the evacuation of Ticonderoga & Mount Independence-our lucky Capture of the Syren Frigate, a Transport Ship & Armed Sloop.  I wish I could mark an equivalent for the destruction of our little fleet in that River. Nothing occurs to me, but the honour acquired by the brave & gallant defence for upwards of a Month against the combined powers of the British Navy & Army & the heavy losses which attended each in their attacks-a 64 Gun Ship & a Frigate burnt, two other Capital Ships exceedingly battered & the whole fleet in Relation compelled to retreat more than once-the loss in the Army by a modest computation not less than 1000. And when 'tis considered that with respect to the expectation of Congress & other people, this defence which when truly told will amaze Europe, was mere chance, medley, Lustre will be added to the Glory of Lieutent. Colo. Smith, Lt. Colo. Greene & Commodore Hazelwood nor ought the alloy of Censure to be mixed from Supposed mistakes which the latter unsupported as he was might have made in his Retreat.  Our Army under General Washington are half in Rags & half of them without Blankets, have remained too long inactive & now discover Signs of moving to Winter Quarters, on the other hand the Enemy have manifested their fears, by fortifying themselves Strongly, & burning a great number of adjacent Houses in which their apprehensions had dictated we might make Lodgements.  Inclosed your Excellency will find a schedule of part of this mischief. We know likewise that their Troops are badly Clothed & worse fed, that they are discon[ten]ted & often mutinous & we hope that reenforcements of Clothing & Men will enable us soon to drive them into their Ships, & that these in January may be too Strongly fortified to get out of our reach. The disaffected who remained in the City & welcomed the Enemy have Suffered amazingly for want of food; to keep life several thousands have come out relying upon the Mercy of our General & many more would gladly come forth if their evil consciences did not dictate danger of another kind.  Congress have appointed three important Committees who are all now in action-One to confer with General Washington confidentially on future operations & if possible to prevent taking Winter Quarters-One to consult with the State of Pennsylvania on the article of Provisions & other matters (3)-a third to translate Confideration into French & to Address the Canadians among whom we   know there is a Majority dissatisfied with English Government.(4) Our Indian Committee have prepared a proper Talk for the Six Nations & at length I have put in motion the Creek Eagle, Tail & Rattle Trap. Commissioners are appointed for inquiring into the State of affairs at Fort Pitt & the Western Frontier & for directing a force to quell those Indians who, at Detroit, have been instigated to Murder many of the back Inhabitants & if practicable to reduce that nest of Mischief.  Major General Gates is appointed by Congress president of the New board of War & to act occasionally in the Field-his associates at the Board, General Mifflin, Colo Pickering, Colo. Jo. Trumbull & Mr. R. Peters, Salary 2500 Dollars per annum.(5) We have great expectations from this Institution. A new appointment for Commerce I hope will soon take place. Owing to ill Luck or some what else the old has produced little more than an Expence most amazing & a ragged Army. Twice within three years Sir, I have been haunted by the Spirit \""four words.\"" Your Excellency is not unacquainted with the Era of her first appearance in the horrible figure of \""Rice to Europe excepted.\"" (6) In this Character however terrible to Some people I encountered her with great Jocularity she has now assumed a more diabolical motto-\""He to be accountable\"" although these compound the most farcical unmeaning phrase in the World. Pleasing & comfortable indeed to some people, the tables are turned, I honestly confess she maddens me every day & threatens to rob me of half of Mount Tacitus.(7) I have been Witness of her obtaining from a public Stock in which I am Interested 80,000 Dollars for a pretended Service in the gross & afterwards of picking our pockets in open day light, for the Same Services in detail Still marking under \""He to be accountable.\""  If not quite so gross as here represented, Something very like it & many Instances worse, very alarming & very Shocking.  I have never yet been Witness of one Instance of realizing those cursed Words. Our Treasury was lately exhausted, New Emissions were made instantly, & for aught I know are making. The demands upon us which at this moment conspire & which are in daily growth are Mountainous, but we must be Satisfied; happy indeed are we, that any quantity of brown paper will answer the calls of our necessities, alarming as this appears we must for the present Submit. Further necessity may, must, in a few Months perform a work which Wisdom ought to have effected Many Months ago.  These things Your Excellency ought to know. I do not hold it necessary to disclose my Sentiments to every body.  This Morning is to come under consideration the Quota of General Officers for each State, I mean to move the appointment of two Brigadiers for South Carolina.(8) I shall most candidly represent the two worthy Men who if I mistake not are the proper Candidates,  if Congress Shall judge it necessary to give us only one, Seniority will probably have preference.  Mr. Deane by a Vote is recalled from the Court of France, Mr. John Adams elected to Succeed him.  Gentlemen here in whom I place the most confidence encourage me to hope that we shall infallibly be in possession of New York or Philadelphia or both before the expiration of January. The former is preferred by some from a prospect of valuable acquisitions of Merchandize. When I consider these may be removed, that the place cannot be held while the Enemy is triumphant in a Navy, and that we have lately received the Strongest confirmation of the great Franklin's opinion that Delaware may be rendered inaccessible & Philadelphia too, if admitting we have a Sufficient army, I am of other Sentiments, agreeing however with those who choose both.  Had Some folks who love to hear themselves talk, acted the part of good Guardians the whole British Fleet would have been Set at defiance & General Howe must have Stolen a disgraceful March out of Philadelphia before this day or have shared the fate of the Northern Hero. 'Tis probable both Lord & General has been taught to believe a passage might be obtained with less than an hundredth part of the difficulty & Loss which they have already experienced, otherwise the General would have proceeded by Steps more cautious than those he was treading from July to September.  General Gates informs Congress few Ships he beleived will be wanted for transporting the fragment of Genl. Burgoyne's Army-on the March towards Boston a Majority of the Foreign Troops & many of the British had deserted. We have Since been told of a Mutiny by the British in which their Escort had been obliged to reduce them by Musketry but we have received no particulars. I send by this conveyance Some papers of Intelligence to Mr. Gervais which he will if your Excellency pleases communicate.  Permit me Sir towards the Close of this long Letter to request most earnestly of your Excellency to apply for leave that I may return to Carolina in February or March or sooner if a Representation shall have arrived in Congress. I humbly think I have a right to demand a respite & therefore I canot feel the least disposition to Sue.  My successors should be told that Candles are abt 5/ per pound, Shoes 50/ a pair & dollars still at 7/6, these are heavy but are very small considerations in comparison with my true motives for desiring to return home. I am with very great respect &ca  ""

  Dear Sir Decr. 1st. [1777] As I was at the Secretaries yesterday I took off a few Resolutions from the Journals for your view, supposing as to the above, that you might have forgotten them, and as to the following, wishing to have your Sentiments.(1) I doubt not you will think it may or may not be proper to take from the minds of foreign Courts the Idea that we are absolutely determined about our conduct towards Gr. Br. in regard to Treaties; therefore the Guard which you see in the Resolves about the time of communicating the different Resolves, which the Commissioners only ought to determine.  Being one of the Committee with F L Lee & Duer to conduct the Resolve of Novr. 29th respecting Canada,(2) I wish yr. Sentiments, promising to you that I am altogether averse from strong sollicitations to that People to become immediately active. They will fall to us of Course. I wish to have them acquainted wth. the nature of our union. But I would not wish to be bound to carry an Expedition into their Country till their Friendship was certain and quite  DECEMBER 1, 1777  General: But I stand ready for conviction upon hearing Arguments for it founded in evident Policy.  It could not be brought about that a Commission [. . .] be sent you by this Post, which perhaps you may be led to expect by Letters delivered to the Express two days ago: But a second messenger will be sent with it and all the proper papers. Genl. Howe will not exchange prisoners till those murthered at New York are paid for with fresh & good Soldiers. He is ready to exchange Officers to be on parole. He wants Burgoyn's Embarkation to be from Rh. Island: but Genl. Washington thinks a whole Season would be gained to the Enemy by that; and wishes a refusal. It will be hard for Massachusetts to have so many additional mouths to feed, but there are good Arguments for denying Howe's Proposition.(3)  Dear Sir, Decr. 1st. 10 o'Clock a.m. We have nothing of much Importance this morning. Fayette being with Genl. Greene in the Jersies fell upon a Pickett of the Enemy, killed 20, took 20 & wounded many without loss. He is delighted with the Militia; and Genl. Greene says the Marquis seems determined to court Danger. I wish more were so determined. Some of the Enemy's Ships have passed up to the City.  We yet hear Nothing from Spencer; but we resolved on the 28th that Enquiry should be made into the Causes of the Evacuation of Fort Mercer and the Conduct of the principal officers commanding there, also an immediate Enquiry into the Causes of the Failure at Rh. Island and Conduct of the principal officers commanding there, also into the loss of Forts Montgomery & Clinton & Fort Mifflin on the Delaware, and into all losses in future Forts, posts & Shiping.(4)  These Resolves will be printed at large. I give you only the Skeleton, for any use within yr. discretion.  I am dear Sir, your most humb Servt. James Lovell  ""

  Dear Sir (1) Novr. 31 [i.e. December 1] 1777. (2)  The reason of my inclosing the Resolves of Congress relative to you was that on Colo. Shelburn's application for a Colo. Commission, he having only had a Lt. Colo., General Washington was directed by Congress to enquire into and settle the Rank of all the officers in the service of the Cavelry. However soon after Mr. Thompson made out proper copies from the Journal containing all the Resolutions relating to the different Colos. and sent them to the General.(3)  I recd your letter for Mrs. Bland and inclosed it to her; Informing her that I should take pleasure in conveying any that she might instrust to my care to you. The enemy have evacuated Ticonderoga & all their other Posts this side the lakes. Could you but be able to form a Junction between Generals Howe & Burgoyne with their armies I think the war would be at an end.  We have every reason to expect there will soon be a war between France & England, the French Ambassador has had directions to demand all the Ships & their Cargoes that have been taken by the English, cleared out for any French Ports & unless their requisition is Complied with he is to leave the Court.  The General at Martinique is directed to prepare for war as fast as possible, and to lay an embargo on all the Ships there, untill a Convoy can be sent for such as are intended for Europe.

  (Copy) (In Committee for foreign Affairs) Honourable Gentlemen York Town Pensylvania Decr. 2d 1777.  Since ours of Octr. 31st, the enemy have by repeated efforts at last overcome our defences on the Delaware below Philadelphia, and we hear they have got up some vessels to the city; but we incline to  DECEMBER 2, 1777  think they will be interrupted much in their opperations on the river by the Cheveaux de Frize and the cold weather. We are just informed by Genl. Gates that the Garison of Tyconderoga & Mount Independance have destroyed the works & the buildings, and have precipitately retreated across Lake Champlain to Isle aux Noix & St. Johns, taking with them only the Brass Artillery, Powder & Provisions. The heavy stores they threw into the Lake. If the Campaign should close at this Period (and if it does it will be intirely owing to want of Cloaths & Blankets, both of which we are in great distress for, having received very few) the enemy have little to boast of. They began it with two armies, one of which has been repeatedly beaten and at length compelled to lay down its arms and surrender on terms. The other, after various chances, in which fortune more than any thing else has been its protector, hath at length possessed itself of Philadelphia. We say Fortune has protected the army of Genl. Howe, and we have good reason for saying so, when the fact is, that, at Germantown the enemy were actually defeated, and accident alone prevented a total & irreperable overthrow. It would have been otherwise had our young troops possessed that calmness of discipline & selfrecollection which is habitual to veteran armies. The acquisition of Philada, which Mr. Howe holds at present by a very precarious tenure, cannot have cost him, in the whole, fewer than 4000 men, since he landed at the head of Elk, and we know that they have lost two ships of war before Fort Mifflin, the one a 64 Gun ship the other a Frigate. Genl. Washington's army, about 18000 is now 14 miles from Philadelphia; and the enemy have fortified themselves in the best manner they can in & near the city by double lines from Delaware to Schuylkill across the common.  The Manoevres near New York exhibit Proofs of apprehension for the safety of that place, because they have evacuated and destroyed their post at Fort Independance above Kings bridge, and have drawn in all their out posts, to concenter their strength & secure, if they can, their hold of N. York. We hope before the opening of next Campaign to put Hudson's River into a state inaccessible to the enemies Ships of war, and thereby to render their enterprizes on that quarter extremely difficult & dangerous.  We have now Gentlemen, given you an exact account of our military situation. With respect to our civil state, we would acquaint you that Congress have passed the Confederation and sent it to the different states, with strong recommendations to give it speedy consideration and return. Extensive taxation is also recommended & seems to be universally adopting. You will readily imagine Gentlemen, that our extensive operations have produced great expence, as our inexperience in war has not furnished us with that wise systematic (Economy which is so necessary, and so well understood by European nations.  We shall have emitted 38 millions of Dollars by the close of this year exclusive of provincial currency. The quantity is too great and of course the quality is injured. The slow operation of taxes will not afford adequate remedy; and the offer of sterling interest does not fill the Loan offices so quick as the necessary expences call for supply.  If a Loan of two Millions sterling could be obtained, the high exchange would enable Congress, by drawing on that fund, to call so large a quantity of paper presently out of circulation as to appretiate the rest, and give time for taxation to work a radical cure. Without this remedy of the evil very pernicious consequences may follow e'er long. Our situation is rendered still worse by the impossibility of vending such products as America has largely in store and which are now greatly wanted in Europe as Tobacco, Naval Stores, Rice, Indigo &c.  The great Superiority of the Enemies Fleet renders it impossible to send these products in any quantity to sea with a tollerable prospect of safety. Thus we are prevented from sending you the 4000 Hhds. of Tobacco which you have contracted for, and which Congress have directed to be sent, although several thousands have for some time past been purchased up for payment of our debts in France. The good Intentions of our friends in that country are almost intirely frustrated by the exertion of the whole power of the enemy by Sea to prevent us from sending to or receiving from Europe any thing whatever. A War in Europe would greatly & immediately change the scene. The maritime force of France & Spain with the N. American cruisers would quickly lessen the commerce of Gr. Britain in the western ocean, and make way for the reciprical benefits of commerce betwixt us & our friends.  We have not been favoured with a line from you since the 25th of May which we lament exceedingly, but of which we cannot complain, since we doubt not but you have written, though we have not been so fortunate as to receive your letters.  We had reason from your promise to expect a monthly packet; and this expectation prevented us from looking out so early as we should have done for a vessel or two from hence. We have heard with pleasure by means of Mr. Carmichael, through Mr. Bingham that Mr. Lee had successfully accomplished his business at the court of Prussia.(1) We remember you informed us that the objects which carried him to Berlin were, besides procuring that princes acknowledgement of our Independance, the obtaining open ports for our commerce, and liberty to sell our prizes therein. We hope the interference of that powerful prince will effectually prevent Russian & German auxiliaries from being sent here by Great Britain.  As the marine Committee have already sent some and will order more of the continental vessels of war to France under your direction, permit us to suggest an expedition which appears likely to bene-  fit us & distress the enemy. We are informed that 2 or 3 well manned Frigates dispatched early in February so as to arrive at the Island of Mauritius in June (being provided with letters of credence for such refreshments & aid of Stores &c. as may be necessary from the Minister to the French Governor of that Island) may go from thence to cruise on the coast of Coromandel 20 days sail from the Island of Mauritius, where they will be in the way to intercept the China ships, besides distressing the internal Trade of India. The prizes may be sold at Mauritius and Bills of Exchange remitted to you at Paris. We would observe that in passing to Mauritius our Ships had better call at Gorce that at the Cape, to avoid allarming the vigilance & apprehensions of the British Cruisers.  Another beneficial attempt may be conducted along the coast of Africa. The French and Dutch settlements & perhaps the Portugaize will purchase the prizes and give bills on Europe. We think your plan of getting one of the new constructed Ships of war equal to one of 64 Guns built for the use of these states in Europe is a very good one; and it may be employed to very beneficial purposes. The heavy iron Cannon which you propose to send will be very wellcome for Fortifications & for Vessels, and they cost abundantly more, here, than you can furnish them for from Europe; besides there is a delay in getting them which frequently distresses us greatly. And surely your determination to supply us with materials wanted here for Ship-building is very wise, since it is by marine force that the most destructive wound may be given to our Enemies. We are directed to point out proper ports into which the stores mention'd in the Resolve of Congress of Novr. 10th may be imported.(2) We are obliged to own that the port of Charlestown in 5th. Carolina & those eastward of Rh. Island are the only safe ones. We wish the number of Manufacturers in Lead & Sulphur had been limited in that same resolve, but we place full confidence in your discretion.  We shall be glad to receive from you by the first opportunity a plan of the militia of Switzerland. You will be pleased to attend to the several matters contained in our former letters, copies of which do not happen to be at hand.  We are with much Esteem, Gentlemen, Your Friends & huml. Servts.

  Sir, York Town, Pens. 2d Decem'r 1777.  Since I had the Honour of writing to you last week: Fort Mercer at Redbank has shard the Fate of Fort Mifflin. The attempts to relieve both were a day too late. Lord Cornwallis crossed the Delaware at Copper's Ferry at the Head of 2500 or 3000 men where he Joind a Detachment that had preceeded him and with a Train of artillery pushed forward to besiege the Fort. General Green was ordered to relieve the Fort but coming too late, it was evacuated. And our own People set fire to several of our Vessells of war which were employd in the Defence of the River. The way is now clear for the Introduction of the British Fleet, & our Gallies [are] in no small Danger. In the mean time, Green and Cornwallis are too near each other to part without Blows. Indeed a Report prevails that they have had an Engagement, that Cornwallis is taken Prisoner & his Division broken: but it wants confirmation.  Congress have agreed to a Confederacy & recommended it in strong Terms to the respective Legislatures. It pleases here after the most mature Investigation, & I am well persuaded that it is the only Plan that can be reconciled to the Majority of the States.

If it is objected to I shall despair of the Happiness of this Country, notwithstanding the bright prospect of our affairs.(1)  Fort Mercer at Redbank soon followd the Example of Fort Mifflin having been evacuated on the approach of Lord Cornwallis, who meant to besiege instead of storming it and the troops sent to support the garrison, under Genl Green, coming up too late. In Consequence several of our Vessels of War were burnt by our own People to prevent their falling into the hands of the Enemy. General How will of Course be master of the Delaware and enable his Brother to bring up the British Fleets to the City. After all this Success they must feel their debility; having no Army to pursue those vast projects of Conquest which they contemplated.

  My Dear Sir York Town 2d Decemr 1777 My publick Dispatches, which have been regular have communicated every Interesting Circumstance which has occurred in this capital Scene of the American War. I lament that it has not been attended with the same brilliant Success as the northern Campaign. Had that been the Case my dear Countrymen woud soon have experienced a happy Termination to all their distresses. The Delaware is now in the power of the Howes and I suppose their Fleets by this time may be safely moord in the Harbor of Philada.  Fort Mifflin made a noble Defence for seven weeks against the united Efforts of the British Fleet & Army. It was not relieved and sank under a Series of the most violent Attacks which were continued without Ceasing. Fort Mercer at Red Bank was evacuated on the approach of Lord Cornwallis with 3000 Men & a heavy train of artillery. It was incapable of resisting a Siege and General Green who was sent to it's Relief did not get up in Season. Several of our Ships were destroyd by our own people least they shoud fall a Prey to the Enemy. It is impossible to form a Judgment of our further Operations this Winter. The Weather for some time past has been and continues most unfavourable to our Troops who are thinly clad- Many of them without Blankets. Our Northern Clime is a Paradise to this watry Country.  Green & Cornwallis must come to blows as they are too near to part but by common Consent; & the Spirit of Enmity is too high to Justify such an Expectation. They burn & destroy without mercy- more [....] (1)  Philadelphia is much distressed & Howe seizes everything as his own not sparing even space.

  Dear Sir, York in Pennsylvania December 3d. 1777 With great pleasure to ourselves we discharge our duty by inclosing to you your Commission for representing these United States at the Court of France.(1) We are by no means willing to indulge a thought of your declining this important service, and therefore we send duplicates of the Commission and the late Resolves, in order that you may take one sett with you, and send the other, by another Vessel. These are important papers, and therefore we wish they may be put into the hands of a particular and careful person with direction to deliver them himself into the hands of the Commissioners. Mr. Hancock, before he left this place, said that he intended to send a Gentle- DECEMBER 3, 1777  man to France on some particular business. Cannot we prevail to get this Gentleman to undertake the delivery of our packet to the commissioners, they paying his expence of travel to Paris and back again to his place of business. It is unnecessary to mention the propriety of directing these dispatches to be bagged with weight proper for sinking them on immediate prospect of their falling otherwise into the enemies hands. We sincerely wish you a quick and pleasant voyage, being truly your affectionate friends,  Richard Henry Lee  James Lovell ""

  My dear sir, Camp at Whitemarsh Decr. 3. 1777 I recd your Favour of the l9th Novr on my Way to this Place, & the Business which your Friend Mr Smith requested You to negotiate, shall be carefully attended to & performed.(1) I thank You for the Intelligence conveyed, & would endeavour to recollect in Return, what has transpired at Congress, had not our Friend Mr. Lovell, who as a faithful & accurate Intelligencer as well as on every other Account, has more Merit than his Collegue can boast or attempt to acquire, rendered it unnecessary. But I see You solicitously enquiring for the State of the Army, which I will endeavour to give in a few Words. It is, from the best information which I have been able to collect with out yet seeing the Returns, stronger than it has been this Campaign. Cloathing is much wanted, & the States are impressed with the Necessity of exerting themselves to send immediate Supplies; from whence I humbly conceive there is a prospect of speedy Relief. In some of the Officers, there seems to be an irresistible Desire of going into Winter Quarters but others are averse to it, as are Congress unanimously; & Mr Morris & Mr Jones, who are of the Committee, as far as I can collect their Sentiments, are not disposed to come to Camp for the purpose of promoting this plan, to which I think it needless to inform You, I am altogether averse. The Committee have large Powers, & should a Winters Campaign be DECEMBER 3, 1777  determined on, will not be reserve in exercising them so far as shall appear necessary to accomplish something decisive. If calling in a powerful Reinforcement of the Militia, or remaining with the Army untill they shall by one vigorous Effort nobly endeavour to subdue the Enemy, will have a good Effect on the Minds of our Friends in the Army, I think the Committee will most heartily propose the Measures, but will promise nothing from their Inclinations, untill the Issue of a Consultation which is to be held with the General can be known.(2)  You will be informed e'er this can reach You, of Your Appointment to represent the States at the Court of France; I hope to have the Concurrence of your Lady when I urge the Necessity of your accepting hereof; it is the earnest Wish of Congress & every Friend to America that You determine in the Affirmative, & of Consequence, Chagrin & Disapointment will result from a refusal. Genteel provission will be made for the Support of these important Officers, but pecuniary Considerations I know will have no Weight in your valuable Mind, & only mention it as my opinion of the generous Disposition of Congress towards these important Officers. I remain Sir in great Haste yours most Sincerely, E Gerry  [P.S.] My best respects to your Lady, General Warren, Mr Adams &c. ""

  Sir, York Town 3d December 1777 The 28th Ulto. I had the honour of writing to you by the Messenger Frederick Weare & of transmitting a Vote of Congress by which you are appointed a Commissioner at the Court of France. Inclosed under this Cover you will find a Commission executed agreeable to the Order of Congress.  You have no doubt heard or will hear before this can reach you of the little affair which happened last Week in Jersey, the attack by the Marquis de Lafayette at the head of about 400 Militia & a detachment from Morgan's Rifles on a Picket of 300 Hessians twice reinforced by British, in which our Troops were successful, killed about 20, wounded more, took 14 Prisoners & chased the Enemy about half a Mile. We learned that General Greene under whom the Marquis had acted had been recalled from Jersey but tis probable from an account received this Morning in a private Letter from Major Clarke something more must have been done before he recrossed Delaware.  The Major writes that from different & corroborating accounts Lord Cornwallis was killed or wounded, that in an attack made at Gloster the Enemy was beat, left 30 dead on the field & crossed the Water after having set fire to that pretty little Town by which the whole was consumed-that the English Officers greatly enraged against the French Nation openly declare they would gladly forgive America for the exchange of drubbing the French-that General Howe had billeted his Soldiers on the Inhabitants of Philadelphia two in each House & taken many of their Blankets for the use of his light Horse which had occasioned universal discontent & murmuring among the Citizens-that A Ship & Brig. richly laden attempting to come up the River had been lost among Cheveaux de frize.  I beg Sir you will do me the favour to present my respectful Compliments to Mr. S. Adams & to accept the repeated good wishes of, Sir, Your most obedt. & Most humble servt,  Henry Laurens, President of Congress ""

  Sir, 3d December 1777. (Introduced by recital of my last date &c, as each Case required.)  Congress ever watchful over the Interests of the United States of America & diligent to defeat the numerous & various practices of our grand Enemy equally Cruel & Subtle have taken under consider- DECEMBER 3, 1777  ation, a device calculated for depreciating the value of the paper Money issued by authority of Congress & of the Several States, after the good people had found it necessary to assert their Rights & to take government into their own hands. The pernicious Stratagem now in view, although the discovery of it, is not quite new, appears more glaring from a late publication in Philadelphia Subscribed by a very great number of those misguided persons who chose to remain in the City & welcome the Enemy to rivet their fetters.(1) It is also notorious that many timid & Lukewarm friends in Several of the States have, from motives probably more avaricious than directly Inimical, long given a great preference to what is called the old Money, which evidently tends to lessen the Estimation & Currency of the New & does in the Same Instance demonstrate, if not an inclination to overturn our Independency, apprehensions or hopes which ought to be banished from the mind of every Inhabitant in the Union.

The Redoubts, lines & abbetties impregnable to any but a Superiour Number of Veteran Troops. Militia will not answer this purpose, therefore an Attack in the lines inelligible.  2d. An attack on the City over Schuylkill by Ice liable to all the above objections because the Enemy will Contract their North lines & run them round the City with redoubts as soon as they know such an attack is Meditated and it is not possible to keep it a Secret.  3d. The Season is so far spent that large Bodies of Militia cannot be Collected from the distant States in time (say all the month of January) & the adjacent States cannot furnish of themselves sufficient Numbers.  4th. If militia in tolerable numbers cou'd be Collected, the Commissaries and Quarter Masters cou'd not supply them with Provisions & Forage.  5.

  Dear General Lancaster Decr. 4th. 1777 Among other inconveniences brought on us by our Enemies, fetching of salt from the Massachusetts Bay to cure provisions in the middle Department for the next Campaign, is not the least. However Congress are more alarmed at the apprehension of being disappointed and not getting the salt in season, than from any inconvenience attending the removal, therefore have appointed a Committee to forward that and other business of the Commissarys department,(1) on information a few days ago from the Commissary General of purchases that among other disappointments he was at  DECEMBER 5, 1777  that late hour uncertain what steps, if any had been taken, to remove a quantity of salt from Boston to the North River as ordered by Congress, for he was not even assured that his Deputy, to whom he had applied, would accept his appointment. Congress foreseeing their interposi[ti]on necessary lately gave authority to the Governor and Council of Safety of Connecticut to appoint to office or to displace any incompitant person in the Commissary Department, to hire Waggons and with the utmost exertion to forward the salt to the North River to be kept in safety by some person he should appoint, until Waggons arrived from hence for it. But not having heard from that Honorable body, being probably too early, and the Committee anxious to know how, and when to direct the movements of the Waggons procured from the Legislature of this State, have directed me to address you by Express earnestly to request immediate information, what train the business is in? or to what part of the North river the salt is sent? whether the whole or what quantity is arrived and to whose care? as not one step further can be taken with prudence until we have intelligence.(2)  The Committee have such relyance on Governor Trumbull's punctuallity, that I have no orders to repeat any request to him, but to guard against any unavoidable delay which may possibly arise from the miscarriage of a Letter I must beg the favor of you if on enquiry you do not find this Business in a proper train at the North River, that after dispatching this messenger you'll be pleased in such case to send Governor Trumbul a Copy of this Letter by Express at the publick Expence.

  Camp at Whitemarsh Sir Saturday Morng. 1/2 past 10, Decr. 6. 1777  We arrived here Wednesday Noon, & after Dinner waited on the General to communicate to him, the Business of our Appointment.(1) He informed Us that You had been kind enough to furnish him with a Copy of the Resolution of Congress relative to this Subject, & having previously required of his general Officers, their several Sentiments in Writing, upon the propriety of attacking the Enemy's Lines in Front, & also upon the most convenient Places for quartering the Troops during the Winter,(2) if such a Measure should be found expedient, he delivered to Us their Answer for our perusal. The succeeding Day We conferred with the General on the Expediency of a Winter's Campaign, & received several Letters which he had collected from his general officers on this Subject-but were prevented from forming any Resolution thereon by the Approach of General Howe's Army, which left the City about twelve oClock that Night, & reached the Neighbourhood of this Camp about 5 the next Morning. They are within Sight of our quarters, being posted on Chestnut Hill opposite the right Wing of the American Army, & from their Motions yesterday, General Washington & his General Officers expected an attack at Noon or this Morning; but hitherto they remain quiet. There was yesterday some skirmishing between the Militia & the Enemy, in which General Erving was wounded & taken prisoner; Capt Martial of the Militia was killed, & one or two  DECEMBER 6, 1777  privates wounded. On the other Hand about fifteen British & Hessian privates were made prisoner; their killed & wounded We have no Accounts of.  We have Reason to think that the Enemy have come out with their whole force & from the present Appearances that a general Engagement will take place; the Consequences of which must be very important. We shall therefore postpone the further Consideration of the Business on which We Were sent, untill the Event of this Motion of the Enemy shall be known. We have the pleasure to inform Congress that the Army is much stronger than it has (been this Campaign) yet been & appears to be desirous of engaging the Enemy; may God grant them Resolution & Spirit, & crown their Endeavours with Success.

  Sir York 6th December 1777. I have in view the Several Letters which you have honoured me with under the 1 8th, 28th & 29th of the Month past.(1) Permit me Sir in the most respectful & Cordial terms to congratulate with you on your Successful enterprize in New Jersey (2)- the agreeable accounts which you have received from home & more particularly on the birth of a daughter-events which conspire to transform mutual joy to your Noble Family & to your numerous friends on each Side of the Atlantic.  I have not been so attentive to all your Commands as I ought & as I wished to have been, but believe me Sir, the delinquency has been absolutely unavoidable-the business of Congress has lain heavy upon me for fourteen days past-their Session each day very long & intervals too Short for dispatching the necessary Resolves & Recommendations to the States, to Officers &ca without intrenching deeply on the Night & constantly rising before day light Some times one or two, Some times four hours. This is almost as hard work as one Night a Bed in Camp, indeed these Candle light hours contain the only moments I can pass at the writing Table with any degree of tranquility, while day light continues & almost all the Evening, I am exposed to incessant attacks, too many of them very trifling, but 'tis necessary to hear all before judgement can be formed & it often happens, the most impertinent plunder the most of ones time. Besides we are not in the most convenient Situation in This Town. Where one cannot exercise a right to arrange family oeconomy, circumstances will occur to interrupt & impede the progress of business. I am lodged where every body Strives to make me happy, but it would be too unreasonable to expect from them to vary all their movements according to the pressure of my Duty, & impossible to accomodate them to the very irregular periods of our adjournments. I have taken the liberty of obtruding this prolix detail in order to account for my tardiness & in Some measure to plead my excuse, especially for my neglect of your intimation relative to Monsr. Capitaine, which has been with me nine days, yet I have not at all interfered in the business.(3) The Subject important as it is, had wholly escaped my memory. Let me incur your Censure, Sir, in preference to the reproaches of my own  DECEMBER 6, 1777  mind, or an attempt to insult you, which would follow a fallacious apology. But Sir, before you will have an opportunity of Superceeding the power you have vested me with, I shall have Set my Self so heartily to the discharge of that trust as will render it unnecessary for you to employ another Attorney & I am not without hope of regaining your confidence. Be assured Sir I will not lose Sight of the Subject until I have done every thing that shall be practicable for accomplishing your desires.  Monsr. Craignie, Monsr. d'balm & Some other French Gentlemen are retained at the public expence while measures for gratifying their wishes consistent with the Service of these States are under consideration.(4) These Gentlemen have many good friends here & Some, more able to Serve them, than I am, but my best endeavours shall never be wanting to forward their attempts in measures calculated for promoting our great Cause.  General Conway has devoted much of his time in York to our Marine Committee by planning & recommending in particular explanations, a Scheme which is very inviting & which, when we are able, will undoubtedly be carried into execution.(5) To part abruptly with that Gentleman would be a circumstance extremely mortifying to a few persons here who hold themselves to be of the best friends to the United States. Had he Served any particular State in the Union with the Same Zeal & good effect which have been conspicious & universally acknowledged in his Military efforts in the Service of the Thirteen, a deputation would have waited on him long before this hour, either with honorable propositions for retaining, or Commands to take leave of him, in terms Suitable to his Merits. We have Something in view which we hope will hold the General longer in America, when the business is matured you shall be duely informed. Whether our wishes succeed or not.(6)  Monsr. duplaisis was not overlooked in the act of promotion to Monsr Fleury, I hope this has been Sufficiently explained by that Gentleman's particular friends.(7)  Every account which we have lately received except those from Sir William Howe's printers in Philadelphia indicate the near approach of a Rupture between France & England. The general Embargo throughout the French West India Islands is undoubtedly a Strong prognostic & this fact is asserted by very good authority from St. Domingo.  Your condescension Sir to take notice of the naked condition of our Soldiery is a mark of paternal regard for these your adopted Sons. When I reflect seriously upon this branch of our distress I see clearly black faults in Individuals & shameful neglect at fountain head. My resentment is excited against others, who, however they are Safely hedged in by partial favour, deserve to be charged. The retrospect is extremely painful. The consequence of Some Men's Self  Interestedness & the gross partiality & inattention of those whose duty it was to superintend & to correct betimes, has already appeared in the loss of some lives, cruel Sickness, boundless desertion & what is to follow, God only knows.  I presume the conference now on the Tapis or possibly just finished between His Excellency the General & the Committee from Congress will determine the question relative to Winter Quarters. We are morally certain of Sending you a pretty large Supply of Blankets & Cloths before Christmas. I hope these will reach the Army time enough to give new cause for thanksgiving on the 1 8th.  The Committee for foreign Correspondence will dispatch to Boston, tomorrow or next day, Letters for France to go by the hands of the Honble John Adams Esquire appointed one of our Commissioners at the Court of Versailles. A Vessel will be purposely equipped for his accomodation & Safe passage. I am sure that Gentleman will be happy in being the bearer of your Commands or in disposing of them in the best manner, if he Should decline the duty to which he is elected by Congress. & I beleive you will find Safe & expeditious conveyances from Camp to Boston.  In time of War with France there will be no tolerable assurance of reaching our friends on t'other Side the Water oftener than one out of Six Letters. I always practiced in former Warr Sending at least a Sixth Copy of every Letter of any importance & found great advantages result from my care, while my Neighbors, less attentive often suffered Losses.  I cannot inform you Sir, any particulars concerning the intended embarkation of Lt. General Burgoyne's conquered Troops. I have dispatched to Boston several Official Letters on that Subject to which I every day expect answers, in the mean time 'tis probable, necessity will oblige Sir William Howe to Support the remains of them where they are, during the present Winter. I have the honour to be, with the highest Respect & Esteem, &ca.  ""

Trumbull, and to forward the Express to him, immediately to Congress, as the movement of the Waggons from hence, for my Brethren of the Committee would not consent to any Waggons being sent before advice of the salt, depended on his answer. Therefore if you have recd. intelligence from the C G P (2) at headquarters to make an earlier stop necessary, you must send Waggons, from thence, which likewise would be a great relief, as the Council here express their apprehensions of much difficulty in obtaining them in these parts, owing to the abuse of imploying numbers of Waggons in the army which were impressed for other and shorter Services. I expect an answer from Governor Clinton next Wednesday, therefore the presence of the C G P will be necessary here or a Deputy to forward the Waggons. Notwithstanding the Exercions of the Legislature of this State, the Vice President hinted his opinion that military aid would be necessary.

The Enemy, the Evening after the Date of my letter, marched out with their whole Force, Which is said to consist of twelve thousand five hundred Effectives. We received information of their preparations a Day or two before, by persons who left the City; & the Camp was alarmed on Fryday Morning abt two oClock. At five the Enemy were about two Miles from the right Wing of our Army, in Sight of our quarters, where they continued untill Saturday Night, during which Time an Engagement was hourly expected. About four oClock on Sunday Morning, the General sent one of his Aids to inform Us that the Enemy had marched to the left, where were the Generals quarters, & had drawn up 2000 Men about two Miles from his place, advancing with another part of their Army, up the York Road. This Morning We are informed, that the Enemy are returning to the Right, from whence I think there is a probab[il]ity of their intending to puzzle our Officers by their Manoeuvres, & send their whole Force against some Point. I sincerely wish that our officers would prevent it by beginning the Attack, And untill such an enterprizing Spirit prevails, think that the Enemy will manoeuvre to Advantage.

The Enemy have drawn a Strong reinforcement from N York, & Genl. Washington a much Stronger from Genl. Gates's Victorious Northern Army.

The recruiting Service ought to be attended to in Our State in case of Accidents, as nothing is to be expected from Pensylvania. Should Our Army be defeated, Our utmost exertions will be requisite.  The several resolutions of Congress sent to the Governors of the States will require particular Attention. That of Taxation is essential above all, the Credit of our Continental Currency depends upon it. The Opening the Courts of Law for the recovery of Debts surely ought to be attended to. The Calling in your paper Currency, especially that Issued under the Authority of the British Government, (as a distinction is made by the Tories & Sordid Whigs already, of at least 100 per Centum which in it's Consequences must ruin Our public Credit) ought to command the Attention of our Legislature.  Coll Martin has been tryed and Acquitted; & has since resigned. Mr. Penn & myself have desired the Governor to apply to the Genl. Assembly to recommend some one or more of Our Colonels as DECEMBER 8, 1777  Brigadiers. Our Troops are uneasy at not having a Genl. Officer of Our State to Command them. You know we have a right to more than One Genl. Officer, should the Assembly think it expedient. I wish you and the rest of my friends would push this Matter. Our officers are exceedingly anxious about it. Coll Sumner writes me it is absolutely Necessary. We are daily entertained by Members of Congress with Paragraphs of Letters, giving an Account of the Surprising exertions of their Constituents. I beg that you will inform me what has been done by Our Genl Assembly in this way. We have often been before them, I hope we shall never be behind them.  Be pleased to tell Mr. Hooper & Mr. Maclain, I shall write them by the next Oppertunity, & hope to have it in my power to Inform them of Genl. Howes defeat.  I wish to hear from you & beg you will be very particular in regard to what is going forward in a Political way. I am with real esteem, Dr Sir, Your most Obed hul Servt. Cornl Harnett  ""

  Dear Sir York Pensylvania Decr. 8. 1777 I received your favour of the 6 ultimo. Several of those of the dates you mention I never received neither do I think I ever shall. Several of the Deputies of the Post office it is beleived most Scandalously abuse their Trust, and I am certain many Letters directed to me, together with such as I write Free upon, are detained by the Way, the Members of Congress Complain generally of this vilanous Practice.  Inclosed is a Hand Bill printed by Order of Congress relative to the Late Convention at Saratoga, this only came to Congress three days ago, as we have had no press here until within these few days & no Gazette as yet published. I shall send you the first.  I am sorry you purchased Coll Kennons Bills, as I am afraid you will be puzelled to get the money, nothing but the Governor of So. Carolinas Letter of Credit can save you unless Mr. Kennons Executors first Settle all his Accounts with the Public. I would advise you immediately to send them on for Acceptance & payment. I am Obliged to you for the Wilmtn. Paper, pray Oblige me with them  DECEMBER 8, 1777  as they follow in Course or desire Jona. Duncibim to Inclose them to me, I want them all. However to keep you no longer in Suspence, I must endeavour to muster up some News for you. You will be pleased first to Observe that Congress know no more of the Intentions of the Army than you do, until some event or Other takes place, Congress have very wisely determined to put it in Genl. Washingtons power to keep his Own Secrets. A Committee of Congress now at Head Quarters have however Informed us that on Saturday the 6th Instant The Two Armies were in Sight of each Other, the Enemy at Chestnut Hill & Our Army at White Marsh, that early in the morning a Schyrmish happened between a Party of our Militia & an advanced party of the Enemy. We lost Genl. Irwin Taken Prisoner, I Capt killed & 3 or 4 Privates wounded, the Loss of the Enemy in killed & wounded not known, but that we took between 20 & 30 Prisoners. A General Engagement was hourly expected, the fate of which will I suppose put an end to this Campaign. Our Army were in the Highest Spirits & wishing to attack the Enemy. Should we be successful in defeating the Enemy, Our Troubles in America on Terra Firma will soon be at an end. But should we be unsuccessful we must be under the necessity of Exerting ourselves to the utmost the next Summer. Virginia have however Voted a reinforcement of 5,000 Militia to be sent forward immediately in Case of Accidents. Alass! We have few Virginias in the Union. As for Pensylvania, she is rotten to the very heart, if she is saved, it will not be by her own exertions. I hope the Assembly will Open Your Courts for the recovery of Debts-That you will immediately begin to lay Taxes as other States have done, that you will Call in all the Currency emitted under the authority of the King of G Britain &c &c these are matters of the utmost Consequence, & Strenuously recommended by Congress to the Several States. Our very Existence as a free People depend on Vigorous Measures immediately to be adopted.  I wrote Mr. Clayton a few days ago,(1) should you see him you may Shew him this mionut Scrawl & tell him he has no right to expect another line from me until I receive another kind of Letter than such as he wrote me by the Marquis La Fayette. As you desire me to write you a great deal of News, I have sometimes an Inclination to invent something very extraordinary, but this matter I shall Consider of; and remain with my respectful Compliments to Mr. Quince & all my friends, Dr Sir, Your sincere friend & Ob Servt.

  Dear Sir Decr. 8th. [1777] By a letter from brother Geary at Hd. Quarters the 6th, 1 P.M.(1) they were in expectation of a general Engagement as the enemy had come out with all their force. There had been a Skirmish the 5th in which Genl. Erving was wounded & taken prisoner and a Capt. Marshall of Militia killed. We took 15 or 16. He tells us that a Mr. Colvill arrived in Camp from Elizabeth Town who had been informed by whig lnhabitants of Staten Island that a Fort was ordered to be immediately built on the pitch of the narrows, and that each Inhabitant was obliged to work every third day. This is confirmed by another Gentleman who was lately on the Island with Genl. Dickinson. This looks as if Howe apprehended a French war.  Genl. McDougal it is thought will recover.  I beg your care of all the letters which I have delivered to Mr. Braylesford for persons out of Boston; either to send them to the first Officer to forward them by any more speedy safe opportunity.

  Dear Sir Decr. 8th [1777] The day after you left York, I moved Congress for an Order in the following words. \""Whereas it is of the greatest Importance that Congress should, at this critical conjuncture be well informed of the State of affairs in Europe, and whereas Congress have resolved that the honble. Silas Deane Esqr. be recalled from the court of France & have appointed another Commissioner to supply his place there,  \""Ordered that the Committee for foreign affairs write to the honble. Silas Deane, and direct him to embrace the first opportunity of returning to America & upon his arrival to repair with all possible dispatch to Congress.\""  This I have sent with the other Papers to Mr. Adams and shall send tomorrow a duplicate to Baltimore to go with the packet which you left there.  I did not think it necessary to move that the Committee should be filled up on such a petty occasion, and therefore I spread a small Plaister for a large wound myself by the following. (1) \""Sir  \""By accident I find myself called upon singly to execute the duty of the Committee for foreign affairs, in communicating to you an order of Congress of this day respecting your return to America.  \""The order stands in need of no comment from the Committee to elucidate it; and, being drawn in terms complimentary to your abilities of serving these United States upon your arrival here, I take pleasure in conveying it, being, sir, your very humb. Servt.\""  I hope, Dear Sir, you will consider this proceeding as giving some sort of definition to the Recall, and in moderate language; as it stood before, he was to be recalled, but the time when was not in any measure marked out.  As to news I can only give you an Extract from the Committee's Letter at Head Quarters dated Saturday. Decr. 6th 1/2 past 10 A.M. \""Genl. Howe's army left the city about 12 oClock that Night (4th) and reached the Neighbourhood of this camp about 5 the next morng. They are within sight of our quarters being posted on Chesnut hill opposite to the right wing of the American army, and from their motions yesterday Genl. Washington & his Gl. Officers expected an attack at noon or this Morning, but hitherto they remain quiet. There was yesterday some skirmishing between the militia  DECEMBER 8, 1777  & the enemy, in which Genl. Erving was wounded & taken prisoner; Capt. Marshall of the Militia was killed & one or two privates wounded. On the other hand about fifteen British & Hessian privates were made prisoners. Their killed & wounded we have no account of. We have reason to think that the enemy have come out with their whole force; and from the present appearances that a general engagement will take place, the consequences of which must be very important. We shall therefore postpone the further consideration of the business on which we were sent, until the event of this motion of the enemy shall be known. We have the pleasure to inform Congress that the army is much stronger than it has (been this Campaign) (2) yet been, and appears to be desirous of engaging the Enemy; may God grant them resolution & Spirit, and crown their endeavours with success. Morris, Geary, Jones.  P.S. A Deserter from the enemy this morning informs that they have brought out on Carriages a number of boats; which is confirmed through various channels. Camp at Whitemarsh.\""  Mr. Geary writes further to Genl Roberdeau at 1/2 past one in the afternoon of the same day, that there was nothing new in the motion of the enemy since the date of his former letter. That a Mr. Colvill had just arrived from Elizabeth Town who informed that Inhabitants of Reputation, Whigs, from Staten Island gave account that a Fort was ordered to be immediately built on the \""pitch of the Narrows\"" and that the Inhabitants were obliged to work every 3d day. This was confirmed by another Gentleman who was lately on the Island with Genl. Dickinson. This wears the appearance of a French War.  Decr. 10th.

DECEMBER 8, 1777  All you knew of the inconveniencies of a Delegate's life at Baltimore, or Philadelphia was shadow to what this town produces. Mr Frost has this day come to a fellow feeling with us.(1)  Mr. Geary on Committee at Head Quarters writes 1 P.M. of the 6th that there had been a skirmish on the 5th in which General Erving was wounded and made prisoner and a Capt Marshall of the Militia killed. We took about 16. There was every appearance of a general engagement on the 6th. Our army was stronger than at any time and greatly earnest for fighting. It was thought that Howe had brought out his whole force, and deserters reported that boats were brought out on carriages. I cannot conceive what they are intended for. He writes us also that undoubted information is given that Howe has ordered a fort to be built at the pitch of Staten Island upon the Narrows. This looks as if he expected a French fleet. The inhabitants of the Island are forced to work every third day. You mention my writing the 14th Octr. I believe you will get scrawls of the 21st of that month and the 2d of Novr. Mr S Adams will advertize the tickets in Boston. He left this with Mr J.A. the 11th of Novr.-his Excellency before that-such ringing and firing! There is no one of the Committee for Foreign Affairs here but I, and our Secretary has not joined us since we left Philadelphia.

  Sir White Marsh Decr. 10th 1777 In Consequence of the conferences we have had with your Excellency, and knowing yours and your General officers opinions on the Subject of our Mission, we have come to the resolutions contained in the enclosed paper, finding them as far as we can judge most consistent with the Public good.(1)  Among the many reasons offered against a Winters Campaigne we were sorry to observe one of the most prevalent was a general discontent in the Army and especially among the Officers. These discontents are ascribed to various causes and we doubt not many of them are well founded and deserve particular attention, and in the course of the present Winter, will be taken into consideration by Congress, and we hope effectually remedied.  That a reform may take place in the army, and proper discipline be introduced, we wish to see the Military placed on such a footing as may make a Commission a desirable object to the Officer, and his Rank preserved from degradation & contempt; for these purposes we intend to recommend to Congress  That an half pay establishment be formed and adopted in the American Service.  That a pensionary establishment take place in favour of Officers Widows.  That a New regulation of Rank confining it as far as possible to the line of the Army be adopted.  That an equitable mode of paying for back rations be ordered.  Should these several regulations be approved and established by Congress (and we have reason to suppose they will) We trust the prevailing discontents will subside and a Spirit of emulation take place among the Gentlemen of the Army to promote the public service and introduce that order and discipline amongst the Troops so essential to the Military character.  As a further inducement the Committee have it also in Contemplation to propose in Congress that the Officers be permitted to dispose of their Commissions under such regulations as may render the measure eligible. We are, Your Excellencys Most Obedt hble servants,  Robt Morris  Elbridge Gerry Jos. Jones DECEMBER 10, 1777  E N C LOS U RE The Committee of Congress appointed to confer with his Excellency General Washington on the propriety and probability of a winters Campaign, and for other purposes, have confered with him on the subject matter of their appointment, and come to the following determination.  That an attempt on Philadelphia with the present Force under General Washington, either by storming the Lines and Redoubts, crossing the Schuylkill, or by regular approaches to the City is an enterprise, under the circumstances of the Army attended with such a variety of difficulties as to render it ineligible.  That the Season is so far advanced as to render very precarious large reinforcements of the Militia from the distant States to cooperate with the regular Army in any attempt across the Schuylkill, and it is apprehended sufficient reinforcements for the purpose, cannot be obtained from the neighbouring States.  That there being time for Congress to determine on the most proper mode of reinforcing the Army before the intended Enterprise can be carryed into execution, it is inexpedient for the Committee to adopt measures for that purpose.  That untill sufficient reinforcements can be obtained such a Post should be taken by the Army as will be most likely to aggreive the Enemy, afford supplies of provision, Wood, Water and Forage, be secure from a surprize, and best calculated for covering the Country from the Ravages of the Enemy, and prevent their collecting Recruits and supplies for their Army; as well as afford comfortable Quarters for the Officers and Soldiers.

I am informd the Assembly of that State will rise the last of this, or the begining of Next week, & as a new delegation to Congress will take place before they rise I expect to be released, at my own request. Letters from Head quarters of last Saturday morning, recd. from the Comee. of Congress at that place (Messrs. Morris, Jones & Gerry) Inform that Genl. Howe had Come out with his whole force & taken possession of Chesnut hill within sight of our Army, that a Genl. engagement was hourly expected, that the enemy brot out with them a number of Boats on Carriages. I recd a letter from Bob dated the 6th Inst. at 10 in the morning & which gives the fullest Accot. & from which you have the following extracts Viz.  \""I wrote you the other day informing that I had been Posted below, near the enemys lines as a party of Observation. I was harass'd for 4 or 5 Nights in certain expectation of the enemys coming out to give us battle. The night before last my Patroles fell in with their advance abt. 12 oClock.

We had a few foot about 25, with which we gave them an occasional fire every 2 or 300 yards so as to amuse them.

There they re- DECEMBER 10, 1777  mained all day yesterday & maneuvred very considerably. What their intention is we can only conjecture. I question very much whether they will dare to attack us in our present position. Nature has done every for it, & we have added considerably to its strength. Some parties were sent out yesterday morning to skirmish with them, chiefly Militia. A Genl. Irwin of the Phila. Militia is wounded & taken prisoner, one Capt. Killed, & a few privates wounded. They came off shamefully, as they eternaly will do, the enemy are this morning in the situation of yesterday, they made no movement in the night, it would have been lucky if they had, the position of our army was alterd after night So as to have recd. them very unexpectedly. A little time will shew whither they mean to fight us. I have some doubts & shall be greatly disapointed if they do attempt it as we are at present. They will probably burn all the little Towns between us & Phila. in order to draw us from our Stronghold. We cannot expect they will leave us quarters so near them. I believe the Genl. will remain entirely on the defensive. It will reflect great discredit on us if they should get back without our touching them, & yet I believe unless they Attack us it will be the case. Indeed it would not be our interest to leave our Strong gro[un]d & attack them on Chesnut Hill. Perhaps rather than not fight us, they may risque an Attempt on us here. A Young man who left Phila. Two days ago adds considerably to the credit of the Accots. you have from Europe. A Packet Arrived on Wednesday Night with intelligence which put the enemy in great confusion. He overheard a Conversation between one of G. Howes Aids & Col. Harcourt, in which they Mentioned Hostillities being comm[ence]d by the French. Their Accots. whatever it was occasioned their order for coming out to be Countermanded for some time. If they have Advice of a War, I suppose they will push for something decissive in this quarter. I beleive we shall meet them on very good terms. Our Army will not be in a better situation.\""  Probably a decisive blow is struck ere this. If fortunate for us it may Speedily put an end to this destructive war, which god grant.  I am Dr Sir with Esteem & regard yrs. Sincerely, W.

  My dear sir Potsgrove Decr 15th 1777 I am favoured with yours of Novr 24th (1) on my Way from the Camp to Congress; & find that You have formed pleasing Expectations of Intelligence from this Quarter, which the Events that have hitherto taken Place will no Ways justifie. The brave officer Colo Smith who defended Fort Mifflin informs me, that Commodore Hazelwood who commanded the Gallies & was honored wth. a Sword; has since behaved like a Poltroon, & by not opposing his Gallies to the Indiaman that was warpt thro' a Channel, wch being shoal was unguarded by the Chiveaux de Frize, the Fort was attack'd on every quarter, the Works beat down, Guns dismounted, & the Garrison after suffering greatly, were reduced to the Necessity of retiring. Had they been supported by the Army, who after several Days Deliberation determined to send a Body of Men to Province Island, to attack the Enemy in the DECEMBER 12, 1777  Rear of their Batteries, It is generally supposed that the Garrison would have held out; but before our Troops arrived the Enemy accomplished their purpose. Red Bank or Fort Mercer, which commanded the other, was so slightly built as not to be sufficient to withstand a Cannonade of 24 Hours, & was afterwards evacuated by the Advice of some General Officers sent to veiw it. Thus the Enemy have possessed themselves of a River, which might have been easily made impregnable, had this State considered its Importance to themselves; & have been defended, had not Delays in the Councils of War prevented seasonable Releif. The Enemy soon after these Events, brot up their Shipping to the City, & are greatly benefited by the Assistance of the Seamen of 300 transports & some Frigates now laying at the Wharves. I was at the Camp upon a Committee of Congress to confer with the General on the Expediency of a Winters Campaign, & to take such Measures thereon as should appear necessary. We were earnestly desirous of an Attack on the City, that by one vigorous Exertion Mr Howe might meet with the Fate of his brother officer G Burgoyne; & should not have hesitated to have called in Militia from Virginia to Massachusetts Bay for this Purpose; but previous to our Arrival on the 3d Instant, the General had consulted his Officers & found them averse wth their present Force to an attack on the City or a Winters Campaign, & urgent to retire to Winter Quarters. However, We determined to consider what was eligible, & to have conferred with the Officers at a general Council, & endeavoured to have reconciled them to the Measures proposed, if different from their own Intentions. But General Howe rendered this unnecessary, by marching out with his Whole Force on the Night of the 4th to attack General Washington. His Army consisted of abt 12 or 13000, General Washington's about 20,000 Combitants, of which 4000 only were Militia. Abt 5 in the Morning of the 5th they were within two Miles of the Right Wing of our Army & continued there untill the Evening of the 6th, when they decamped & marched to the left & in the Morning of the 7th attacking & driving in our Pickets, they made Dispositions for Battle within half a Mile of our Camp; but after remaining there untill the Evening of the 8th they marched back to the City. Several Skirmishes happened between the Enemy, & Colo Morgan's Corps & the Militia, in which General Erving commanding the latter, from this State, was wounded & taken prisoner, a Major Morris of Morgan's Corps was wounded & 40 or 50 killed & wounded on our Side. Sir James Murray Captain in the Enemy's Service was dangerously wounded, & a considerable Number of Waggons with wounded Soldiers have been sent into the City; some Inhabitants say 80, but I beleive the Account is rather exaggerated. They have lost by Captivity & Desertions from 50 to 100 privates, burnt several Homes & plundered without Discrimination. Yesterday Morning General Washington decamped with a Veiw of taking Post on the other Side   Schulkyl to cover the Country, & refresh his Men, untill by additional Reinforcements he might be able to approach the City, but arriving at Swedes Ford the Militia under the Command of General Potter who had crossed it were attacked by the Enemy within a Mile or two of the Bridge. Whether they had Intelligence of the Orders given by General Washington the Evening before, or intended to make an attempt on the Baggage Waggons, I know not, but am informed that they marched out in the Night with the main Body of their Army. General Washington has not yet crossed, & should he persist in it, I have no Doubt that a general Engagement will ensue. I am sometimes induced to Wish most earnestly that the two Armies were in the eastern States, that the Militia like a Cloud may rise & overwhelm the Enemy; but after many Instances of the most happy Events from what We supposed unfavourable Circumstances I cannot but apply to the present Contest the general principle of Mr Pope, \""Whatever is, is best.\"" Congress are exceedingly dissatisfied with the Loss of Forts Mifflin & Mercer & the Miscarriage of the Rhode Island Expedition & have ordered an Inquiry to be made into the Causes thereof. This they have extended to Forts Mongommery & Constitution, being determined in future that no Fort, post or ship of War, belonging to the united States, shall be lost by Misconduct or Cowardice, with Impunity to the delinquent officers.  The late Recommendations of Congress, relative to Taxation, Confiscation, & Regulation of Prices &c, if vigorously executed by the Several States, Will probably have the most happy Effects. The Measure Last mentioned, is essential to the Support of the Credit of the Currency. When the necessaries of Life are exceedingly scarce nothing will prevent Extortion, but the Interference of the Legislature; let the Currency be Specie, & the quantity be much less than is requisite for a circulating Medium, And Extortion will still be the consequence, unless the Laws of the State prevent it. Had the Measure been general, when the N E States regulated Prices, I have no Doubt that it would have been successful; at least with concommitant Measures to support the Currency; but the Neglect of it in the southern States was attended with the most enormous Exactions within their jurisdictions, & the Report thereof reaching the Eastern States made the Merchants & Traders very uneasy under their Restrictions & prompted them to send their Effects to other States for a better Market. If there are Doubts & Hesitations about the Matter, I am apprehensive that it will be defeated, & wish not to realize the Consequences; but if the several States, convinced of the Necessity, are determined to confine Avarice to its proper Bounds, I flatter myself they will succeed to their Wishes.(2) I have wrote to Mr Otis on the Subject of Cloathing, & desired him to communicate to You my Sentiments on the Matter.(3) I am informed by General Washington that 3 or 4000 of as fine Troops as any in the  Service, are unfit for Duty from the Want of Cloathing, & that Sufficient Supply would enable them to take the Field immediately. The Articles therefore must be taken wherever found, & at reasonable prices, since the Neglect hereof may weaken our Army & infer the most ruinous Consequences. I wish to have your Sentiments on the Expediency of preventing all persons whatever (excepting publick officers) from purchasing the produce or Manufactures of these States or any Commodities therein imported, more than is necessary for the annual Consumption of themselves & Families, without Licence therefor, & giving Bonds not to exceed the retail prices stipulated by the States. Few Retailers are sufficient for each County, & an unbounded Licence to Speculators has not a Tendancy to increase Trade, but promotes Extortion. This should not be continued longer than the War, or than is necessary to execute the regulating Acts, & if any person wants to export (altho it answers few other purposes than to supply our Enemies) they may easily obtain a permit.  My Compliments to Mr. Adams's & all Friends, being sir with much Esteem yours sincerely, E Gerry  P.S. The politicks of France wear an extraordinary Appearance, but G Howe must have recd. alarming Intelligence relating thereto, as he has ordered the Heights of Staten Island near the Narrows to be fortified, & the Inhabitants are obliged to work every third day.

  Dear Sir York Pensylvania Decr. 12. 1777 I wrote you a few days ago by Post since which I recd. your favour of the 11th ultimo. Genl. Howe Marched out of Philadelphia on Friday last with his whole force with intention as was immagined to attack Genl. Washington in his lines at White Marsh, the Two Armies remained in sight of each Other until Sunday the 7th, Our militia under the Command of Genl. Potter Schyrmished with them, & in the Evening Coll Morgan with his Rifle men had a severe Action with the Enemys right wing, or rather a part of it, the report is that they lost a great many men killed, upwards of an hundred. Our loss but trifling. We drove the Enemy & kept the ground. Genl. Howe filed off his Army in three Columns, & is returned to Philadelphia, &  DECEMBER 12, 1777  has thus prevented the drubbing you wish for. Jackey remains Still at Burlington & is well, it is impossible for me to see him there, but I have wrote Mr. Mitchell to let him come to me;(1) there is a very good School in this Town, where I could have him under my own eye, & could bring him home to you in the Spring or let him remain in this Country, as times and Circumstances might admit. Genl. McIntosh only stayed a day here & proceeded this morning to Head quarters.  Whether the Enemy will keep possession of the City this Winter I know not, but should they remain there, they will I think have a very uneasy time of it.  I am Sorry to find the prices of every thing with you so very high, the vilanous practice of raising the price of all the Necessaries & Conveniencies of life is spreading all over the Continent. I hope the several Legislatures of the States will immediately pass Laws to prevent this growing evil, America has more to Apprehend from the Consequences of this Avaritious Spirit, than from two Such Armies as Genl Howes. I find in the Wilmington papers an extract from One of my Letters; what I write my friends in hurry is not intended for the Press. I hope they will in future, should they think proper to publish any intelligence I may send, to do it at least by way of Extract of a Letter received from a Gentn at York to his friend in Wilmington.  Many Resolutions & recommendations of Congress have been lately sent to the Legislature of the several States, which will I think (if attended to) answer many very Salutary purposes.  Mr. Called on me this evening about 8 oClock & sets off early in the morning. I have been Obliged to Attend the Treasury board, & could not sit down to write before 10. I have not time to mention several matters to you, which I must defer for the present. But remember your Bills drawn by Kennon Ought immediately to be forwarded, I am Sorry you did not take Our Treasurers, instead of them; exchange them if you can for such. It ran in my mind that Our Election was to have been in the Fall, but I find it is to be in the Spring. We have as yet no News paper here, which is unpardonable. Give my Compts to Phillis & tell her her Mother I could not get a Sight off, it was long before I could hear of her, & just as I had got into a Train of finding her, we were obliged precipitately to retreat from Philadelphia. Should Genl. Howe remove, I will still find her out.  Write me I desire by every Post. I am, Dr Sir, Your Affet & Ob Sert. Cornl.

  Gentlemen York Town 12 December 1777 In the Character of a Delegate in Congress give me leave to address you. Your President has been confined to his Chamber & his Bed for three days & Nights past during which time he has not had three hours Sleep. The Malady under which he labours has made such progress as to convince him by reflecting upon former attacks that he will not be able to move out of the House nor to attend his duty in Congress for some Weeks to come. When he accepted the Honour which you were pleased to confer on him it was with a single Eye to your service in the most comprehensive meaning. Now he finds himself incapable of performing his duty he is anxious to Resign that Honor, which he accepted only on obedience to your Vote.  These, you may depend upon it Gentlemen, are the genuine sentiments of his mind.  There already lies upon his Table much business which with pain he thinks of, because it is not in his power to give proper dispatch to it. Every day unless you are pleased to prevent it, will accumulate the heap, public business will be impeded and some branches run into Confusion.  I therefore humbly move you Gentlemen to proceed to the choice of a President as an act of propriety & necessity. Be assured I should have continued to serve you with diligence & fidelity if my health had permitted, I trust I shall not only be seconded in this Motion but that there will not be a dissenting voice in Congress.(1) I am, Gentlemen, Your faithful Coadjutor & humble servant,  Henry Laurens ""

The Virginia is under sailing orders and waits for those men to proceed. As we are very anxious to get her to sea we hope you will give all possible dispatch to this business.

  Sir, York Town State of Pennsylvania Decr. 14th 1777 Nothing of Importance hath taken place lately respecting our and the enemys army but a movement of the latter from Philadelphia,  DECEMBER 14, 1777  and the circumstances which attended it; an Account of which I will do myself the honour to transmit to you in an Abstract of Genl. Washington's Letter to Congress of the 10th Instant.(1) On Thursday night General Howe moved from the city with all his force, excepting a very inconsiderable part left in his lines and redoubts, & appeared the next morning on Chestnut hill in front, and about 3 miles distant from our right wing. The Pennsylvania Militia were ordered from our right to skirmish with the light advanced parties. Brigr. Genl. Irvine, who led them on, had the misfortune to be wounded and to be made prisoner. Nothing more occurred on that day. On Friday night the enemy changed the ground and moved to our left within a mile of our line, where they remained quiet and advantageously posted the whole of the next day. On Sunday they inclined still further to our left. In their movements their advanced and flanking parties were warmly attacked by Col. Morgan and his Corps, and also by the Maryland militia under Col. Gist. Their loss I cannot ascertain but I am informed it was considerable, having regard to the number of the corps who engaged them. About sunset after various marches & countermarches they halted. On Monday afternoon they began to move, and, instead of advancing, filed off from their right and the first certain Account that I could obtain of their intention was that they were in full march towards Philadelphia by two of three routs. I dispatched light parties after them but they were not able to come up with them. The Enemy's Loss I cannot ascertain. One account from the city is that 500 wounded had been sent in. Another is that 82 waggons had gone in with men in this Situation. These I fear are both exaggerated and not to be depended on. We lost 27 men in Morgan's corps killed and wounded, besides Major Morris a brave and gallant Officer who is among the latter. Of the Maryland militia there were also sixteen or seventeen wounded. I have not received further returns yet. I sincerely wish that they had made an attack. The issue in all probability from the disposition of our troops and the strong situation of our camp would have been fortunate and happy. At the same time I must add that reason, prudence and every principle of policy forbad us quitting our post to attack them.  A few days ago I was presented with a Bill of exchange drawn by Timothy Coffin on Messrs Ellery & Marchant contl. Delegates at Philadelphia for one thousand and fifty dollars, in favour of Richard Ellis or order; which Money I received of the Auditor General by Virtue of a warrant which Mr. Marchant had obtained in July last. The Warrant is for ten thousand dollars.(2) Mr. Marchant had received thereof one thousand dollars, and I received fifteen hundred and sixty, out of which I paid the before mentioned Bill. The remainder I have taken to my own account and given the State credit for it, so that there is a ballance due on said Warrant of seven thousand four hundred and forty dollars. I will take this Opportunity to mention  that before I left Congress I procured an Order upon the Treasury for two thousand dollars to enable me to pay a ballance that was due to Messrs. Purviances in Baltimore on the Diamonds Cargo &c, and to supply my own Pocket, which was exhausted.(3) When I returned I waited upon the Assembly several Times in order to exhibit my account; but they were so engaged and the Sessions so short that I could not find an Opportunity to present it. The Assembly may depend upon my exhibiting a faithful Account of any Monies I may receive out off the treasury for the use of the States, and upon my close Attention to its best Interest. Congress have determined upon the mode of Inquiry into the causes of the failure of the Rhode-Island Expedition, and have appointed Genl. Whipple of N. Hampshire, Robert Treat Paine Esqr. of Massachusetts-Bay, Mr. Marchant Esq. of Rhode-Island, Oliver Elsworth Esqr. of Connecticut, and Egbert Benson Esqr. of New-York. Commissioners for that purpose: the Time of their meeting to be the first Monday in February and the place Providence.(4)  The Question hath been asked sideways who is to pay the Expence of that Expedition; but it hath not yet been serious asked and I hope it will not. If the Expedition had succeeded we should never have heard a word about the Expence, and perhaps if the Authors of its failure are brought to Light, their Punishment may appease the Resentments of Congress and obliterate the Idea of an enormous useless Expence. We have no late news from France or the W. Indias. When any thing occurs of Consequence I shall write to your Excellency. In the mean Time give me leave to subscribe myself with great Regard Yr. Excellencys most obedt humble Servant,(5)  William Ellery ""

  Sir York-Town Decembr. 15th. 1777 I received yours by Brown of the in which I find you are still Complaining that you cannot get rid of the publick Stores on hand in any Regular way. Congress have done every thing in their power to relieve you, the fault has lain entirely with Coll Stewart in not taking care of his Department, they have repeatedly DECEMBER 15, 1777  wrote him or directed Mr Buchanan to Inform him of the dificulties which lie in his department, where he is and what is become of him we know not, we have heard that he had set out for the Eastern world sometime agoe but to prevent every dificulty for the future they have Impowered Govr Trumbull &c to supply every defect in both the purchasing and Issuing Department in that part of the world. Orders have been long Given to Mr Buchanan for 2 hund thousand dollars on the loan office in Boston for the Eastern Department to be paid in preference to any other (as by the returns made from the Office they were good for more than that sum) & to be Immediately sent to Mr Colt, & to save & Indemnifye you the Treasury Board have rendered Valid, and to pass to your Account all the Stores Any Genll Officer shall either take or that you may deliver to their Order. I hope before this you are in a great measure relieved of your dificulties. You Inform me that you were about to set out for Boston & Salem to purchase Cloathing for the Colony & had it not been for Coll Williams' letter (1) Informing you of the jealousies & Suspicions Congress had entertained of your Integrity &c you was about to undertake to supply with provisions from Connecticut but on his Information you declined having any thing to do with it & was so advised by the Govr & his Council. I should have thot that both the Govr & you had been long enough acquainted with Coll Williams, I mean the suddenness of his Temper, the warmth of his Imagination, the strong Impression sometimes a little matter makes on his mind (tho of an honest good heart), to lay so great a Stress upon his painting. I found he had wrote & feard as for some other of his letters they were unguarded & would have no good effect but the Contrary. He Informed me the ground of his letter was when some affairs touching the Commissy department were Agitated in Congress a Certain Member he would not tell me who not knowing as he supposes of his Connection with you Whispered him that he feard you was so put out and Chagrined at the New Regulations that you had in some measure embarrassed and discouraged Others in undertaking. I have no doubt but some body might throw out such a hint to him, and possibly some might have such fears or suspicion; but is that enough to lay so great a stress upon, when you have been repeatedly Assured that Congress in general & believe may say now Universally entertain a high opinion of your Abilities & Integrity in your whole Conduct in that Department. They have given you the Strongest Evidence of it by a Unanimous unsollicited Vote even of every Individual in Appointing you one of a Board the most honourable As well as Interesting to your Country. We had formerly 2 or 3 heady mischief making Gentn. in Congress, they are gone & believe will be here no more, the party is broke up, all is harmony & Union. Schuyler is no more. I was rather sorry to hear your long defence & Exculpation in your letter to Congress against Charges  they had never heard nor believe Suspected and was equally sorry to hear the Governors letter (2) Complaining of the Treatment his sons had received especially at this time, when I can assure him & you that both you & your brother the Paymaster Stand in a fairer point of light with Congress than any two Gentn. ever employ'd by them, yet I am Sensible that at a time, to serve some friend or particular purpose your brother was superseded, & you have had now & then a Squib thrown at you but without making an impression prejudicial to your Carracter. Your brother John was ill treated I believe but all would have been put right had he been a little more soft in his letter. Old Doctr Witherspoon of high Scotch feeling was Netled & without any prejudice against the family principally opposed its being rectified. You say it is a little wonderd at my & Coll Williams Recommendation of a Certain Gentn. I did it from political Motives, which can explain to you when I may have the pleasure of seeing you again, which hope will be soon. Congress have great hopes & expectations from this New Constituted Board of Warr. The Army in every Department wants a total reform & regulation both Internal & External, we are determined by the blessing of Heaven to have it Effected, our appointment meets with Universal Applause, great Expectations are from it. We have also Appointed Inspectors Genll of the Army in every department, who will be Executors & Assistants to the board of Warr, will Inspect, make their returns & reports to you. They are Gentn. of great knowledge, Abilities & Integrity and believe will be Intent to reform abuses, regulate disorders, Establish discipline in the Army.(3) Since the above receivd yours from Boston of the 7th, what is past cannot be helpd, we must make the best of what is to come. It is unaccountable what is become of Mr Colts order for 2 hund thousand dollars, a duplicate is now sent & a large sum in Cash, the order on New York reversed & an order to Govr and Council of Safety on Connecticut Loan office in Lieu of it, which we find now to be good for a Considerable sum. Congress have had every department to attend to, hope it is in a good way at last. The Govr & Councill may Employe Coll Champion & whom they please, Assist Mr Colt Cooperate one with another as much as possible. I know they dont want the trouble, but the mistakes in past Will require greater Exertions in the future. Our Army have done so much fighting this Summer they seem much Inclined to goe into Winter quarters and prepare for spring. If so How will have free plunder & possibly disturb them in their proposed quiet.  My affectionate regard to family & am sincerely, Your.  E Dyer ""

4599,dg008375,1777,Articles of Confederation,"""Articles of Confederation
  [ante December 16, 1777](1) I consider the Congress at present as a General Council of America, instituted for the purpose of opposing the usurpations of Britain, Conducting the war against her, and forming foreign alliances as necessary thereto. Incident to this must be the General direction of the Army and Navy, because they are the instruments of the war.  Also for the providing necessary funds for the disbursements, because without them neither Army or Navy can subsist. Also the making Treaties with Foreign Powers, to be binding on all the states alike and equally to affect them, because this is the essence of foreign Alliance.  This Idea of the Powers, use and authority of Congress, excludes all coersive Interpositions within the States respectively, except with respect to the Army and Navy, because the States are competent to every exertion of power within themselves. Also the appointment of ways and means for supplying the Contingents of Men, Money or other things otherwise than by recommendation which always implies a power in the State to reject.  Also the power of imprisoning or otherwise punishing any Citizen, because that is not necessary for the end of their Institution, and every individual is to be tried and punished only by those Laws to which he consents. The Congress for this reason can give no authority to any Man or set of Men to arrest or punish a Citizen, nor can it lawfully be done but by the Authority of the particular states.  Also all pretence for continuance of a Congress after the war is concluded, or of assuming a power to any other purposes than what DECEMBER 16, 1777  are above expressed. The Congress now determines by a majority which need not be more than five, and which seven is always conclusive. If the last mentioned exclusion be not right, the Congress might engage the states in Confederacies, injurious to all but the continued majority.  'Tis my Opinion that every State has a right to control the Cantonement of Soldiers within their Territories, but as all the Governments are not yet settled, it might be inconvenient to say any thing of it, and it is not necessary. Whenever a State finds occasion to exercise this right, I think none will be hardy enough to dispute it. But I believe it will be necessary for every established State to provide a mode whereby the Civil Authority can interpose to prevent Courts Martial from exceeding their Jurisdiction. 'Tis true a Soldier expressly consents to be bound by the articles of War, and to submit to the Martial Jurisdiction, but in all Trials, the first Question is the Iden[ti]ty which must in this case be the same as Soldier or Citizen? If the Court Martial can determine this question, it is in their power to call any Citizen a Soldier, and to subject him to military Law. This evidently points out the necessity of the check of the civil authority. The Confederation is a subject of the highest importance, but not having yet passed the House, except when in Committee, it seems it must not be laid before the assemblies. I shall deem it my duty to examine every Article of it with the most critical scrutiny, and submit my thoughts to the Assembly, and receive their Instructions. But I am told by the President that it will violate my obligation of secrecy, to do this before it has passed the House.  If the Assembly agree with me in the foregoing Ideas, of the Power, use and Authority of Congress I beg leave to recommend that they instruct their Delegates not to depart from them, nor to consent to any act or resolve which shall tend to exempt the Courts Martial from the Control of the civil power in the States.  I am not desirous of these Instructions in order to restrain the Delegates. I believe none of them even without Instructions would vote contrary to those Ideas, but as all questions are carried by a majority in Congress, the state may perhaps be bound tho' her Delegates should dissent, especially where the Instructions are so general and Powers so indefinite as ours. I wish the State therefore to instruct, and by some public act to disclaim being bound by any resolves contrary to her Instructions. Without something of this kind, according to the present Constitution of Congress it may be impossible for the Delegates to preserve the Independence of the State, from Encroachments for by that Constitution they are not allowed to protest or enter their Dissent.  These thoughts are humbly submitted to the Honorable the General Assembly of North Carolina by their most respectful humble Servant,  Thos. Burke  ""

  Sir Manour Livingston 16th Decemr 1777 Congress have been pleased to appoint Brigr. General Stark to the Command of an Enterprize which they have much at Heart-It's success under Providence depending entirely upon Secrecy. For fear of a miscarriage of the Dispatches, I am directed in a personal Conference at Albany to explain their Views and deliver to him his Commission and Instructions. Where that General is employd at present Congress is uninformed and have therefore directed me to trouble you with forwarding the enclosed Letter.(1) One from you might quicken his Journey to Albany, and as no Time should be lost I must request that Favour, as well as that you will be so obliging as to employ in this Business an Express on whose Diligence you can rely, and to order him to proceed to this place with General Stark's Answer as soon as possible. If you can form any probable Conjecture when it may be expected your Opinion will regulate my Conduct.  Be pleasd, Sir, to accept my sincere Congratulations on the glorious Success of the American Arms under your immediate Command. A Series of Victories so critical and decisive cannot fail of producing, with the Blessing of Heaven, The most important and permanent advantages to the United States; while they have rescued this devoted Government, already almost ruined, from total Destruction.  I hope to have the Pleasure of an Interview with you before you proceed to Congress. From what I learn it would ease your mind on a Subject which, without any Reason, has given you Pain. You may be assurd that you hold a high Place in the Esteem and Confidence of Congress.  We may hourly expect important news from the Army under General Washington. As I passed thro' Reading I collected the following Circumstances, on the Truth of which you may rely. General Howe marched out of Philadelphia the Evning of the 4th Instant with all the troops he coud collect leaving only 1500 men to garrison Philadelphia. In his march he was harrassed by Morgan's Light Infantry and the militia. He however on the 5th took possession of Chestnut Hill within two miles of our army which was strongly DECEMBER 16, 1777  posted to the number, I believe, of 20,000 on the Hills near White Marsh Church. On the 6th he made a Movement round the Left of our Army which that night laid on their Arms expecting a general Attack. It is thought that the intention of the Enemy in this Enterprize is to try their Strength with General Washington, & if successful, to burn Lancaster, Reading, Pott's Grove and German Town; and then to return to Philada. Despairing of their original Plan of subjugating America they descend to a predatory war. To burn the inland Towns, & to spare only the Sea Ports, which are exposd to their Navy, seems to be their humane Project. The wanton Destruction of Kingston is no bad proof that this is at least a probable Conjecture.  Governour Clinton three days ago removd to Pocepesy where he proposes to meet our Legislature. I flatter myself that you will confer with him on the Defences of Hudson's River before your Departure; as Congress depends on your advice, and considers the Security of the Communication between the Northern and Southern States as an Object of infinite Importance.  I left York Town the 5th Instant. All your Friends there are well. Be pleased to present my most respectful Compliments to Mrs. Gates, and tell her that Mrs. Peters has been in the utmost Peril, but is happily deliverd of a Son. Our mutual Friend Mr. Morris with Mr Jones and Mr Geary are with the grand Army as a Committee of Congress. You will also be pleased to deliver the enclosd to your Son.  The Route I pursued is, I believe, by far the most comfortable especially as you will be accompanied by a Lady. I therefore recommend it to you, vizt, thro' Fish Kill, New Winsor, Warwick, New Town in Sussex, Easton, Bethlehem, Allen Town, Reading, Manheim, and across the Susquehannah at Anderson's ferry, which is only ten miles from York Town.  If you have any news be pleasd to favour me with it by the Bearer.  I have the Honour to be, very respectfully, Sir, Your most obedient & very humble Servant, Jas. Duane  ""

In the mean time it will be neces- DECEMBER 16, 1777  sary to convene the Commissioners. When that can be effected I can form no Conjecture but must wait for your Information. I am obliged to see General Starke at Albany, & General Gates is desird to send for him. You will judge from Circumstances how long it may take before the Express can reach him & Return to me & he repair to Albany. From your opinion on this Point, I shall regulate my Journey; for which I shall therefore be obligd to you; as well as for fixing the meeting of the Commissioners Accordingly that I may be saved the Trouble of a double Attendance at this inclemit season.

  Dear Sir York Pennsylvania Decr. 16. 1777 This day I received your favour of the 6th last Month and am glad to hear of your safe return to your family, & have also the pleasing expectation of seeing you soon again in Congress. I wish it was in my power to give you such Intelligence as I know you wish for. Our Army remained almost inactive at White Marsh since the affair at German Town, until the 6 Instant when the Enemy marched with almost their whole force in the night, & appeared towards Noon in Sight of Our Army, took post on Chesnut Hill & other Strongholds in that Neighbourhood, a General Battle was daily expected; but Neither of the Generals seemed inclined to quit their advantageous Post. In the mean time some small Schyrmishing ensued. Our Militia with Genl. Irwin at their head attacked one of the Enemys advanced parties & a Smart firing followed which lasted about 15 Minutes. They then retired to Our Main body with the loss of 2 Captains & 10 to 12 men killed and wounded; among the Latter was Genl Irwin who was taken prisoner being advanced too far before his men; the Enemy's loss not known. The Enemy for several days kept up a Shew of attacking Our lines but on the 10th filed off in three Columns & returned Within their Redoubts. Coll Morgan with his riflemen had a very smart Action with a party of the Enemy in which he lost more- men than he has lost the whole Campaign, 26 in Number. The Enemy must have  DECEMBER 16, 1777  Suffered exceedingly from the fire of those Excellent Marksmen. Genl. Washington was informed by some deserters that their loss in killed & wounded was 500, but this acct. he thinks Exaggerated. I fear it was. Genl. Howes Intention in this Maneouvre was to have attacked Our Army Expecting to find them off their guard, in this he was dissappointed, & then by keeping up a Shew in frount with his light Troops, he marched off his Artillery & heavy armed Troops towards the City; soon after those in front filed off on the right and Left, & by a precipitate March Out general'd us, as usual, a Large body of Our light Infantry were ordered to pursue but could not come up with them until they had got within the Lines. Thus ended this affair. They have since sent a Large body over the Schuylkiln to forage. The Militia under Genl. Potter were Surprised, but maintained a Smart Action with them for a Short time, took several of them Prisoners, but lost an equal Number at least of his men taken by the Enemy; this Account comes not from Authority but is believed. We have as yet no News Paper Published in this Town otherwise I should send you some of them. Since the Confederation has been finished, several Reccommendations to the Legislatures of the States have been sent by Expresses. I need not mention them, they will Speak for them selves. I beg you will inform me of the Temper you find Our Assembly in. Are they inclined to pursue Spirited Measures? For Gods sake fill up your Batalions, Lay Taxes, put a Stop to the Sordid & avaritious Spirit which has Infected all ranks & Conditions of Men. Regulate the Prices of all Comodities, at least such as are immediately useful to Our Army; The united States will not much longer be able to procure them at the very exorbitant prices they are now sold at.  We have already received an Account from Connecticut that their State is much dissatisfied with the mode in the Confederation of fixing the Quota of Each State by the value of Lands. Numbers of Inhabitants including Slaves is their favourite Plan. A Valuation of all Property throughout the Continent was allowed to be the most equitable mode for fixing the Quotas, but this was said to be impracticable.  All our foreign Intelligence indicates that Europe will soon be in a flame. Let us not depend upon this. If we have virtue, we certainly have power, to work out our own Salvation. I hope without fear or trembling.  I wish I could inform you of a Victory Obtained over Gl Howe. I fancy we must wait until Stern Winter builds a Bridge over the Schuilkiln. Small parties of our Army have been Successful however in taking several of the Enemy Prisoners. 95 arrived in this Town the night before the last & three officers of Low rank. They go on to Virginia Tomorrow.  As to the prospect you wish for, of accommodating Mrs. Burke here, I beg you will not think of it. Be assured it is Impossible, you will  hardly be able to get a bed to Sleep in. I should be sorry to see my Country woman in distress which be assured must be the Case if you bring her here. No my friend, let her remain at your own peaceful Mansion in expectation of better times. Be assured that my expenses since I arrived in this Town, a very little more than two Months has been upwards of £200 Currency, and I never Lived in so wretched a manner in my life. I shall be under the Necessity of procuring an advance from the Treasury of at least 1000 Dollars over and above my Allowance from the State, which is very handsom. I shall be content if this will bring me home with a Single dollar in my pocket. Mention not this; If you do, I am sure you will not be believed, but it is as true as the Gospel. God only knows what this Country will Come to at last.  Mrs. Trist is well at Lancaster. I have had great pleasure in Corresponding with her.(1) She is a sweet sensible Creature. I shall forward your Letter tomorrow. I wish you health, Happiness & a good Session. With unfeigned esteem I am, Dear Sir, Your affect & Obed Servt.  Cornl.

  Dear Sir York Pensylvania Decr. 16. 1777 I wrote you a few days ago in Answer to your favour of the 11th ulto. You are Constantly Plaguing me for News, & I can hardly ever meet with any thing Interesting to Communicate. The Campaign has been very inactive, ever since Genl. Howe took possession of Philadelphia. However he made a Movement on the 6th Before day, with almost his whole force, leaving only a few men behind & appeared in Battle Array before Our Army at about a Miles Distance, Expecting to find them unprepared, in this he was mistaken. Some small Schyrmishing ensued in which the British Troops suffered more than Ours, Genl. Irwin Attacked their light Troops with some of Our Militia, we took some prisoners about 20 & lost about 10 or 12 killed & wounded, the General was among the Latter & taken Prisoner by the Enemy. Coll Morgan had a very severe Conflict with another party, this Gentn commands the Virginia & Pensylvania Rifle men. He lost about 26 also killed & wounded. The Enemys loss must have  DECEMBER 16, 1777  been very Considerable as those troops are excellent Marksmen, a Deserter says 500. Genl. Howe after Maneuvering for several days, kept up a Shew of his light Troops in Front, marched of[f] the remainder of his Army to Philadelphia, the light Troops following precipitately and altho a party of Our light Infantry pursued, as soon as the intention of the Enemy was known, they could not Overtake them until they had reached their lines. 95 Prisoners came to this Town the Night before last, they will tomorrow be sent to Virginia. Genl. Howe Ravages & destroys wherever he comes, German Town we are informed was pillaged in a most Shameful manner, many of the fine Houses near the City have been plundered & burnt, in Short as far as they can reach they Spread Devastation around them among Whigs & Tories indiscriminately. Heaven in its own good time will I hope punish those Butchers & Murders, there must certainly be some chosen Curse laid up in Store for them. We hear that a large body of the Enemy have been since Over the Schuilkill to plunder the Inhabitants. Genl. Potter who Commanded a Body of the Militia on that side has had an Action with them, he took some Prisoners with the loss of as many or more of Our men, the Particulars of this affair are not as yet come from Authority.  I have not yet received an answer from Mr. Mitchel about Jackey, unless you soon Contradict it I shall have him with me. I remain, Dr Sir, Your sincr. friend & Ob Sevt.

  Decr. 17th [1777] Since I wrote the foregoing, Genl. Washington transmitted to Congress a letter from Genl. Heath to him, in which he informed G.W. that Application had been made to him by the officers concerned in the Rhode Island expedition for their pay, and desired to know whether the Continent or the States who furnished the Troops were to pay the expence. This brot on the question which I had hoped would never have been started; and after a slight agitation, in which I perceived it was the Sense of Congress that the Continent ought to bear the Expence, it was referred to a Committee to examine the Journals in this Regard, and to report to Congress.(1)  Congress this day recd. a Letter from Genl Washington dated near the Gulph mill Decr. 14th of which the following is an Abstract.(2) On Thursday Morning we marched from our old Encampment and intended to pass the Schuylkil at Maddison's Ford where a Bridge had been laid across the River. When the first & part of second Division had passed found a body of 4000 under the Command of Ld Cornwallis possessed of the heights. Our troops were obliged to repass the bridge which prevented our getting over until the succeeding night. This manoeuvre on the part of the enemy was not in Consequence of DECEMBER 17, 1777  any Information they had of our Motions; but was designed to secure the pass while they were foraging in the neighbouring Country.  They were met in their advances by Genl. Potter with part of the Pennsylvania Militia who behaved with bravery and gave them every opposition 'till they were obliged to retreat from their superior numbers. He collected a good deal of forage and retired to the City the night we passed the River. No Discrimination marked his proceedings.

  Sir Manheim(1) Decr. 17th. 1777 In consequence of the mention made of my Brother by Dr Franklin & Mr. Deane in their Letters to Congress last Summer I wrote a Friend (in whom I had & still have the Utmost confidence) to watch his conduct & give me a just acct. of it. I confess myself to have been much provoked at the Commissioners for writing \""That Mr. Thos. Morris must be displaced from his agency\"" without assigning their Reasons & the more so as they had promised me to assist him with their Advice & inform me of his behaviour but seeing him publickly Attacked & not receiving in due time any private Letters from them on the Subject I gave belief to a Tale that was told me by Persons from France insinuating that my Brothers Agency interfered with theirs & was in favr. of another person. Under the influence of this Belief I wrote Mr. Deane a Letter which I am sorry for having since discovered that he did not merit the censures I very freely passed on him.(2) [He] wrote me an acct. of my Brother but the Letter did not come in time. He mentioned in genl. terms that he was too eager in pursuits of pleasure [to?] admit (he feared) of due attention to business. At the same time I recd. many letters from My Brother assuring me of his constant attention, care & assiduity which was also confirmed to me by some Masters of Ships whose business he transacted. This I thought good Authority & felt myself happy in the expectation [of?] him become Usefull to his country & himself but alass the Scene is changed & this day I had the Mortification to receive a Letter from my Confidential Friend assuring me that my Brothers Conduct is exceedingly blamable. [He] has put all his business into the hands of Messr. Pliarne, Penet & Co[mpan]y & J. Gruel of Nantes. These Gentn. are sufficiently solid I believe & imagine they can not have much Money or Effects in hand because they have generally sent [us?] Goods as fast as they recd. Cargoes. However they do not hold themselves obliged [to] acct. with Mr. Lee for the sd Management or for the Rait. This I fancy has brought on some dispute. I think as they do that Mr. Lee is only to take up the business from the date of his appointment & from that time all the Cargoes have been addressed to Wm. Lee & Thos. Morris Esqrs. Jointly. Consequently [. . .] as Authority only those & I believe it will be best for the Commercial Committee to require Settlement of all the other publick Concerns & direct the Balla[nce] if any is due to be shipped out in Goods agreable to Contract. This will end the Bickerings between them & Mr. Lee & induce them to dispatch the Goods especially if the prospect of future employment is held out to them & which for aught I know they may merit as well as others. Under this Idea I have wrote the Letters inclosed herewith DECEMBER 17, 1777  as from the Commercial Committee and have signed them.(3)If they are approved you & the other members had best sign 'em also and have them Copied in the Letter Book & dispatched by the first Conveyance. With respect to Mr. T.M. it was never my Wish or desire that he should be employed one Moment longer than he rendered Service, therefore I have wrote a Letter of Dismission to him also enclosed herewith which I desire may be signed by the Committee if approved & forwarded immediately. It is needless to [say] how much my Feelings are wounded on this occasion. Let it suffice [that] I do my Duty to my Country by taking these measures the Moment I knew them to be necessary & the Letters that convince me of it are but this day arrived. Perhaps it may be necessary that this & the Letters enclosed with it be laid before Congress & if you think so I can have no objection. Indeed I woud chuse Congress should be made acquainted with my readiness to dismiss Mr. T M. from their Service the Moment I thought he merited such dismission. The Bills mentioned in the Letter to Mr. Lee Mr. Ceronio was authorized to draw & they must be paid as he sent Arms, Powder, Blankets &c. for the amot. last Winter.

4611,dg008387,1777,Articles of Confederation,"""Articles of Confederation
  [ca. December 18, 1777] (1) Article 4th  The Constitution of No. Carolina permits not the Privilege of Citizens to any who have not resided therein 12 months, and paid Taxes. (Local protection is given to all within the Teritory.) The Legislature therefore cannot ratify an Artikle which gives such privileges to persons residing in other states. Our Commons are voted for by all free Citizens, and if the Inhabitants of our Neighboring States have the priviliges of Citizens in ours they might insist upon the right of voting for members of our Legislature which would be a political absurdity. It seems therefore proper that this article should be Amended by adding after the clause refer'd to-not inconsistant with their respective Constitutions. The Provisionary clause of this Article, in my Opinion, deprives the States of every power to increase or regulate their particular Commerce, Agriculture, or Manufactures. They cannot prevent by duties or restrictions importations, or Exportations Injurious to any of them. This surely is what no Staple State ought to admit, and that of all ours, who has so many Staples.  Article 5th This article supposes that the appointment of delegates is at the (discretion) Will of the Legislature. Tis an Error with respect to No. Carolina. Those Officers are the creatures of the Constitution, are to be annually chozen by ballot, and if superceded must be in the same way. No choice can be made for less than one year. This article wants alteration if all the States are Circumstanced as ours. For us I think the following would do, \""Delegates Constitutionally appointed and Controlled by the respective States shall annually meet in Congress on the first Monday in November.\"" The remaining part of this article tho [unjust?] in the mode of determining Questions, must be submitted to for the sake of public Convenience, but if the latter clause exempts the Delegates from Prosecutions in their respective states for their misdemeanours in Congress, it takes away the Control of the states, and being Contrary to our Constitution cannot be admitted.  Article 6th The first clause of this Article in my opinion imposes very unnecessary retraints upon the States. The various affairs of a free Commercial People will require them often to enter into Conferences and agreements with foreign States, and the Commercial Interests of each state ought to be its own peculiar care; and Subject [to] no DECEMBER 18, 1777  Control or Interposition from others I can see no propriety in such a Restraint as each State ought, in my opinion, to be at least at liberty to Enter into any Commercial Treaty it may think proper so that it be not inconsistent with Treaties entered into by the united States. These seem to me to be of Importance to the Staple States. There can be no reason for subjecting them to restraints which may arise from the Jealousy or ambition of others. Each should be at liberty to increase its wealth and strength as much as possible. Tis sufficient that they be restrained from using them to the Injury of their Neighbors, and that they be obliged to Contribute in Just proportion to the Common defence.  The latter part of the first section of this artcle is right.  The second Section goes too far. The Word Treaty ought to be left out. The States will often have Occasion to Treat on subjects which Concern none but those Engaged in it; and there can be no reason for restraining them from it. If the united States have power to prevent any alliance or Compact injurious to the whole it is sufficient, and this purpose will be answered by giving them a Negative on all Compacts between two or more States.  The third Section is right.  The fourth Section so far as it regards the Navy appears to me to be impolitic. It speaks a Jealousy which I fear will for ever prevent the united States from having a powerful Navy, tho' nothing is more Essential to its future Security against foreign Enemies. The Emulation of the States in this particular ought to be encouraged by every means, for that Emulation will be the most powerful Instrument for giving to the whole a formidable Navy, and with such they will be secure against the World. I see no reason for the Jealousy. The fleet of one State cannot endanger an other because they are accessable to each other by Land, and a Sea Invasion might very readily be Counteracted by a Land Invasion. The rest of this Section is right.  The fifth Section is right in every thing but what relates to Indian Wars, and it will be difficult to frame an Article to suit in this particular. I am inclined to think this might be left for the Subject of partial alliances, for all the States are not Interested in it and yet Several States have One Common Interest in it, and there are Still Some particular Interests in which but One or few States are Concerned.  Article 7th I have no Objection to this provided the provision recommended by Connecticut takes place.(2)  Article 9th 3 This Article is exceedingly Comprehensive, it's matter is of the greatest Importance, but its arrangement seems to me much too   Complicated. My own Idea of the Power which Congress ought to possess is founded on the following propositions.  The United States ought to be as One Sovereign (power) with respect to foreign Powers, in all things that relate to War or where the States have one Common Interest. But in all Commercial or other peaceful Intercourse they ought to be as seperate Sovereigns.  The first is Necessary, because No One can be defended from the Evils of war but by the united force of all, and to make this force the more Effectual, their union for its Exertions should be as close and simple as possible.  The Second is Necessary, in order that each may acquire Strength to as great a degree as its Circumstances may admit, without being Subject to restraints which may arise from the Jealousy of its neighbors. And as the growth of each is its own proper Concern, and cannot be prejudicial to the whole, but on the Contrary advantageous to them as long as the force acquired is Still Subject to be applied for the Common Security, by One Common Magistrate, I can perceive no reason for a power in any Common Council which can restrain the Commercial or other peaceful Intercourse of the States, among themselves, or seperately with foreign Powers, and it can answer no purpose but to subject the Property of the States to partial Combinations in the Common Council.  A private Citizen who embarques a part of his fortune in a Copartnership would be deemed very unwise should he suffer the members of that partnership to possess a power that might restrain him from [improving] the remaining part of his Fortune to what extent he pleased Consistent with the Common Interest. Equally unwise in my Opinion is it for a State who unites with others for Common defence to submit to a power which may prevent the growth of her Strength and Oppulence. Pursuant to these propositions my Ideas of the powers which ought to be in Congress are as follow.  In General they should have the Power of declaring War, and, Con[cluding] peace. But wherever a war should be declared before actual Invasion or Commencement or Threatening of some actual Hostilities, any State ought to be at Liberty to renounce the War and become a Neutral power but when Hostilities are actually Commenced against any of the States, it ought to be deemed Common Cause, and none should withhold assistance.  Also they should have the Power of Concluding Treaties of alliance equally binding and affecting the whole for the purpose of strengthening the Common Security. This should be restrained like the former to defence, for it ought always to be in the Power of each state to remain Neuter in all Offensive Wars whether the united States be principles or allies in it.  These Powers necessarily require that the Congress should send  and receive Embassadors, but not that this Power should be sole and exclusive. I should like an Amendment to this purpose \""shall have the sole and exclusive Power of declaring War and Concluding Peace, and of Sending, and receiving ambasadors in the name of the united States of Entering into Treaties and alliances equally binding upon, and affecting the whole.\"" Here the Exceptions to those general rules should come by way of provision. The remaining powers in the first Section of this article are Incident to the power of declaring War. They are only an Execution of the Law of Nations quoad hoc.  The second Section is [b]adly worded, \""the united States shall be the last resort on appeal in all disputes between the states.\"" I have no Idea of an appeal, or last resort unless their be some prior Jurisdiction and prior resort, and I know of no such thing between the States. But my Objection to this Section is more Substantial. If the Congress are to Nominate the persons who Constitute the Judicatory I can easily foresee it will not always if ever be impartial. The Congress cannot know any persons to appoint, but such as are Suggested by the parties and that State which has the prevailing Interest in Congress will thus Nominate all the Judges. Their being drawn from each State, and afterwards drawn by Lot is no Security, because three persons in each State are easily corrupted. If this article were amended by giving the Nomination by ballot to the States not Interested it would answer better to my Idea of an Impartial arbiter between the States, and the Congress should have this Power only as the Official Instrument for erecting the Occasional Tribunal, and for carrying its degrees into Execution. As it now stands they have it too much in their power to Influence the decisions which they themselves are to execute which in my Opinion is dangerous in any political Community.  The third section might be easily fitted to the Amendment I propose.  The four[th] Section includes many powers which I cannot perceive either to be necessary or proper for Congress. Regulating the alloy of Coin struck by authority of any of the States, fixing the Standard of weights and measures, regulating the Trade and affairs with Indians, and all that appertains to the Naval force which ought never in my opinion to be under any restraint or authority of Congress except in time of public war. The first of these is dangerous, because it gives to a Council which is Composed of but very few members from each State and which is without Control an unlimitted power over the property of Individuals. The power to increase the alloy is a power to pay off any Debt with less than the sum Contracted for, and involves an extensive power over property.  In the fifth Section the power to borrow money and emit Bills, is an unlimitted power over all property. It is a power to Tax at pleasure, and ought never to be in Congress but when given by the   States upon Special Occasions. It is Contrary to the fundamental Maxims of our Constitution, Vizt [that no] Man is to be subject to any Imposition but by [consent of] his representatives. The Congress is not the representative of any one Community. The members are delegates from the Legislatures, not represent[at]ives of the people, and the Delegates of one state are not the choice of the other States nor has any state a check on the Delegates of another State.  If the Legislature can delegate their power to tax to any person they may Delegate it to the Executive Magistrate, and may make him absolute, by giving him the power over the property of the Community. If they cannot delegate to him they cannot delegate to any other. The delegation in any case is transferring that power to others which the Constitution vests solely in the Legislative Magistrate and is as unconstitutional as if the Governor or Judges were to Substitute other persons to exercise their respective powers, or as if the assembly were to appoint substitutes to Enact Laws or impower the Delegates in Congress to enact Laws.(4)  ""

  Dear Sir 18 Decr. [1777] A Packet arriving this Week directed to the Committee of Correspondence, and containing only a Letter from Berlin for Congress,(1) I took the freedom of opening one directed to our worthy Friend S Adams in yr. Brother A's handwriting, of which I send you a copy so far as was material to the Public.  Paris July 31 st \""Journeys to the Courts of Spain & Berlin have satisfied me that the determined system of Europe is to let us struggle through this War as we can with the warmest Professions of Friendship, with the strongest declarations of their being interested in our success and therefore ardently wishing it. Nothing can move them from their quietism & caution which are carried to a perfectly ridiculous extreme. Spain is totally occupied with its little Portuguize War; France is governed by Timidity in the excess; and the 3 great northern Powers are immersed in schemes of plundering the Turk & the Pole, and dividing the spoil. In this situation of Europe, notwithstanding the justice of our cause has rendered all men in our favour, it is not wonderful that you are left, like Hercules in his cradle, to strangle the Serpent that is the terrour of Europe.  \""In this Situation it is happy for us that the extravagance of the enterprise has already so exhausted the means of our Enemies that, it is certain, this is the last campaign of vigour they can make against us.  \""When our point is secured by the energy of our own exertions, we shall think it happy that the fears & occupations of the powers of Europe have prevented them from forming treaties with us, when our situation would have given them infinite advantages.  \""When our distresses are past & our fears subsided, we shall be enabled to see & to follow our interests in the alliances we form; which I do not think would be intirely the case at present.\""  Besides this public matter of your Brother's letter he adds a Note. \""A Mr. Carmichael obtained from me a letter to you under a pretence of his going immediately to America. I have since found him to be a very unworthy person, whom I can by no means recommend to your patronage.\"" You will see more sentiments of this kind written to Coll. Francis. I wish these hints had come before our late Action of Mr. C____.

Mr. Geary has one dated Nantes the 5th of that month, which speaks of the cowardly disposition of the French Court. I do not count this an absolute contradiction of Bingham's letter of Octr. 13th because a Gentleman from America trading at Nantes Sepr 5th might be a Stranger to ministerial measures entered into time enough to reach Mr. B thro' the General of Martinique by Octr. 13th. However, Sir, tho' I attempt to reconcile these accounts so as to make the Story of war stand, yet I am very far from being sanguine in the belief of it. Your Brothers history of the Temper of the several Courts seems by far the most natural of any other which has come to hand.(4)  I expect we shall have an enormous mercantile account from De Francy, I suppose it is the House of Hortales which your Brother Wm. hints his fears about.

  Dear Sir, York Town Pennsylvania Decr. 19th. 1777.  I most sincerely wish it were in my power to advise you to such a Conduct as would most advance your happiness and the happiness of your family; but here I am at a Loss. If I could determin this point you should have my most hearty consent to embrace what should appear eligible. It would assist me much in forming a Judgment if I should know what Salary your present parish would give you to settle with them, and how you like the place and people. If the place & people should be as agreeable as at New Haven; and the Salary is not considerably less I think I should advise to your settling in Portsmouth. An hundred Dollars, in my mind, would weigh more than the Honour of Presidentship, and the Trouble I imagin of the Presidt of a College much exceeds that of a Minister, not to say any thing about the superior Expence in Living of the former to the latter. I wish there were a Prospect of your Newport Flock ever returning, but alass! they are scatter'd up and down the Land like Sheep without a Shepherd, and it is probable that many of them will never return again to Newport. If I could foresee that in the course of a few years there would be enough of them collected to give you a comfortable support I should not hesitate to desire you not to accept the Presidency of Yale College, and to refuse settling at Portsmouth, or any where else, for I don't know any place where if you were family, could be comfortably subsisted, you would be so happy as at Newport; and I am perswaded that the Second Congregation in Newport will never find a Minister whom they will so universally love and respect as Dr. Stiles; but this is so improbable that in considering the subject of your Election it ought not to weigh much.(1) I dont remember that I ever receivd the Letter you wrote to me from Mr Marchants respecting this Matter. If I had ever received it I think I should have answered it. I wrote you a Letter sometime since (2) in which I said something humorously regarding your future return to Newport; but tho' humorously said it had, as sometimes my funny speeches have, a very serious meaning. I think, may it please your reverence, that if you could take a rich Wife at Portsmouth and could make it in your Bargain that She should go with you to Newport, when Peace and Independency shall be established, it might settle this knotty business. Most ardently wishing you in this and in all your Ways infinitely better direction than the wisest of Mortals can give, or even your own uninspired Wisdom can suggest I continue to be with the sincerest Regard for you and your family, Dr Sir, yrs most affectionately, Wm Ellery  [P.S.] The Enemy's Army have been out twice from the City lately, the first time with a determination to attack our Army it was said;  DECEMBER 19, 1777  but it seems it was so advantageously posted as to defeat their Intention.

Congress had some time ago, by a Committee, recommended to Genl. Washington, if he determined to take winter quarters, to dispose of his army in such manner as would most effectually cover the Country, &c. They have now ordered the memorial of our State to be transmitted to the Genl, & have desired him to inform Congress whether he is about to canton his troops, & where, & what provision he has made for securing the East side of Schuylkill & the State of N.

  My Lord, York Town Decr. 20. 1777. We have been much alarmed by a report that the Army was going into Winter quarters on and about Wilmington, thereby leaving New Jersey and a great part of Pennsa. entirely open to the Enemy. This Supposed measure produced several Resolutions of Congress, which, with a Remonstrance on that Subject from the Legislature of Pennsa. are forwarded to the Commander in Chief requesting his particular Attention to the Security of New Jersey &c. We had before Congress the Opinions of the General officers respecting proper places for Cantoning the Army, and with great pleasure find you in favour of the Valley near Schuylkill, which in the judgement of all  DECEMBER 20, 1777  or most I have met with is the only place for defending the Country and preventing Supplies to the Enemy, as the Army at Wilmington would leave great part of Pennsa. and Jersey greatly exposed to the Enemy's Ravages, the Shiping up Delaware would be lost, and all the extensive Salt works in Jersey destroyed, and not unlikely a general defection take place in this State, and many parts of Jersey, and Supplies for the Army from the Eastern States greatly Obstructed. It is now said the Army are Sitting down in the Valley which I heartily wish may be true.  Many have long depended upon the interference of France in our favour, they indeed Supply us with many necessaries, but no certain prospect opens of their declaring war. Their timid court are unable to shake of a Dread of Great Britain, they wish us well but dare not openly espouse our Cause. Spain is so intirely taken up with her Portugal affairs, that She has almost forgotten us. Austria, Prussia & Russia are all seeking their own interest, and Meditating a Division of the Turkish Dominions, and but little regard the Dispute between us and Great Britain. Our Enemies are busy in Supplicating Supplies from Germany from whence she may draw a small reinforcement, but must principally depend upon their own Subjects. We also must depend upon our own force relying upon the blessing of Heaven for Success. France & Spain appear to have some thing important in view by sending troops to the West Indies, but their designs are wholly unknown to us and perhaps undetermined by them.  A Ship from France lately Arrived at Portsmouth in New Hampshire with 48 brass field pieces four pounders with Carriages Compleat, 19 Nine Inch Mortars with Shells, Cannon Shot, small Arms, Powder, & Sulphur. We have a prospect of soon having in our power a full Supply of Cloathing for the Army.  We have no late News from France, I have given the Substance of the latest.

  Dear Sir York Decr. 20th. [1777] With some other papers I send you the Copy of a Copy of one of Genl. Burgoynes letters to Genl. Gates, which is not only interesting to our State in particular, but to the general Cause of the United States.(1)  The Returns which had been made to us of Artillery &c taken from the Enemy had induced us to make several Queries to Genl. Gates respecting the Standards, Cartouch Boxes, Bayonetts &c which appeared to have been destroyed. Genl. Gates tells us that upon Burgoyne's Word of Honor the Standards were left in Canada, and that the other suspicious Appearances sprang from the Conduct of our own People & certain Necessities, but not from any Breach of the Convention by the Will of Genl. Burgoyne or his Officers. Our Friend Gates is disposed to make the best of every Thing. Others in that Quarter of the World are found who wish to make the worst. Nor is it in that Quarter only, I assure you. Indeed, for my own part I begin to have the strongest Suspicions of Messrs. Howe & Burgoyne's Intention to slight the Tye of the Articles settled at Saratoga. Howe is totally above regarding his own Promises. He wrote to Genl. Washington that an Officer not above the rank of a Commissary or Quartermaster might go into Philada. to view the State of the Prisoners; yet he refused to admit Mr. Boudinot when he went with a Flag for the Purpose. Burgoyne says the public Faith is broken; and at the same time he is asking Genl. Washington or Congress, thro him, to let the Embarkation for Europe be from R. Island, at least, so far as regards himself, if it is not permitted for the whole. Is it not very suspicious that both Howe and Burgoyne feel quite at ease about any Promises made to persons of such Character as they openly affix to the Americans?  You have doubtless e'er this been made acquainted with G. Burgoyne's critical Disposition in regard to the descriptive List of his men which was to have been taken by Genl. Heath's order. For this and other similar pride it was thought proper to take hold of Mr. Burgoyne's manner of asking a Favour of Congress thro one of its Officers: In consequence, the following Resolve was passed the 17th. (2)  Resolved That Genl. Washington be directed to inform Genl. Burgoyne the Congress will not receive nor consider any Proposition for Indulgence of altering the terms of the Convention of Saratoga unless immediately directed to their own Body.  With a Degree of the Arts of our Enemies this Resolve is penned to lead Burgoyne into direct Petition to Congress, tho it does not give an absolute Promise to grant his Petition. You will find in some of my attendant slovenly scrawls so much encouragement to expect from me Intelligence about our grand Army upon the Return of the  DECEMBER 20, 1777  Committee, that I do not know how to avoid saying something about it, now, though 'tis a Subject very sickening to even a strong Stomach.  The Majority of the Officers were fixt & determined against a Winter Campaign, and the Nakedness of the Soldiers furnished such abundant Argument to their Leaders, that the Committee could not recommend anything better than a Cantonment which would best tend to cover the Country and accommodate the army.  It was evident, among Friends I say it, that our Army was not inclined to fight Howe when he gave them 4 days opportunity. The Committee therefore could not give it as their Opinion to the General that he ought, with that same Army, to force the Lines of the Enemy, or attempt the City by the Schuylkill. In short, unless we secure Half pay to officers and Pensions to their Widows and make their Commissions vendible, severe Discipline in respect to officers cannot be introduced, and consequently none at all in respect to Soldiers. But the General does swear that, if the Commissions are made desirable, he will cashier without favour or affection till the Army becomes vigorous. In this hope we breathe this day; but verily my own Share of Hope is not great enough on this Promise as to make me relinquish the Idea of an annual Choice of all officers.  The Report of Genl. W's Intention to canton near Willmington has brought a Remonstrance from this State to us, and I momentarily expect another from the Jersies: The latter State will feel Howes vindictive Hand, if left exposed this winter. Their brave Militia have given him peculiar provocation and the Submission of some of the People to receive his Protections last year have proved but a temporary loyalty will excite his bitterest Malice.  This State is now become truly alarmed and ready to make the greatest Exertions, but tis too late to save a great Part from a severe scourging. But I drop these matters and close by urging you to work manibus pedibus for the down fall of Extortioners, that the wives & children of both Officers & men in the army may not be starved to death in their Absence.

  Sir December 20th. 1777 There has lately arrived in New Hampshire a French ship with a large quantity of Brass Cannon and Military Stores for the United DECEMBER 20, 1777  States. The Gentleman who has the direction of the said Vessel has informed Congress that he expects a frigate of 54 Guns with a large Cargo of Cloth part of which is the property of a Company of Merchants in France and the other part we imagine is upon Continental Account, will arrive about this time in Virginia. As it is of great importance to America to encourage a Commerce of this Sort, and to prevent the said frigate from being taken by the British men of war, The Marine Committee have thought it adviseable to give your Excellency this information, referring to your Judgment the propriety of employing one or more fast sailing boats the fidelity of whose hands you can best depend on, to keep a Look out in such manner as you may think best calculated to give the earliest intelligence to the French Frigate of the situation of the British Men of war. We have no doubt of your taking every precaution to prevent this matter from being made public and also of giving such directions as may answer the above design. We have the honor to be with great respect, Your Excellencys, Most obedt servants (1)  ""

  Dear Sir [December 21, 1777] (1) Your letter was so agreeable that when I read it I should have ceased to think that you ought to have answered mine sooner if you had not apologized for omitting it so long. When I read the Convention I was so disappointed that I was disposed to criticize every part of it and to ask many questions which at another time perhaps I should not have done. At that time I did not know so well the situation of affairs on the North River nor that of our army. I am better reconciled to it now than I was, and was I sure the enemy would preserve their public faith should be satisfied.(2) The reason I asked you why Ticonderoga and Mount Independence were not included in the Convention of Saratoga was because I thought those places were garrisoned by soldiers under the command of Burgoyne. The question on the word contest is wittily answered. The question on the word post was occasioned by a misprint in the newspaper I read. Instead of British post it was port. General Gates hath returned the number of the enemy at the time of the Convention, but not an account of their losses since the time they crossed the Lakes; nor our loss from time to time and the number of our troops Continental and Militia at the surrendry. I am sorry to find the Commissary's and Quarter Master's departments in such disorder. I expected Confusion in the former from the plan; the latter would have been less confused if Genl Mifflin had not by an ill state of health, been obliged to resign the office of Quarter Master General. He is greatly recovered and is now appointed a Member of a new constituted Board of War, of which General Gates is appointed President; the other members are Cols Trumbull (the late Commissary General) Pickering and Mr Richard Peters. Genl Gates still retains his rank of Major General and may be ordered into the field when Congress shall think necessary. When this Board meets it is expected that they will rectify the errors & disorders in those departments, and put every thing in the Army within their sphere on a better foot than they at present stand. General Conway is appointed an Inspector General of the Army with the rank and pay of Major General. The duties of this office it would be impertinent to point out to General Whipple. I am in hopes that the measures adopted and adopting will enable our army to take the field early in the Spring under great advantages. Genl Howe with his whole force moved out of Philadelphia the fourth instant with an intent as he had given out, to attack our army and drive it beyond the mountains; but after marching, counter-marching & manoeuvering several days with a view of drawing General Washington from his strongholds they returned in again. On the eleventh our Army marched from their old encampment, and intended to pass the Schuylkill at Madison's ford, about DECEMBER 21, 1777  12, or 13 miles from Philadelphia where a bridge had been laid across the river. When the first & part of the 2d division had passed, they found a body of 4000 under the command of Lord Cornwallis possessed of the heights. Our troops were obliged to repass and were prevented getting over until the succeeding night. This manoeuvre on the part of the enemy was not in consequence of any information they had of our motions, but was designed to secure the pass while they were foraging in the neighboring country. They were met in their advances by General Potter with part of the Pennsylvania militia who behaved with bravery and gave them every possible opposition, until they were obliged to retreat from their superior numbers. Cornwallis collected a good deal of forage and returned to the City the night our army passed the river. No discrimination marked his proceedings. All property whether friend's or foes that came in their way was seized and carried off. Our Army by the last accounts was near the Gulph Mill, about as I am told, 12 or 13 miles West of Schuylkill on the Lancaster Road-where they intend to winter I know not. I wish there was the same spirit in the main army as displayed itself to the Northward and that the militia in this state were animated with that ardor which blazed forth in the Sons of Hampshire, Massachusetts and Connecticut on the banks of Hudson; then our harrassed troops might winter gloriously in Philadelphia; but alas!  Our soldiers in the hands of the enemy at Philadelphia and New York, especially in the former, are treated in a most barbarous manner and a number of them have perished with famine. Some of them have died in the State house yard with grass in their mouths as I have been informed different ways. How long shall we forbear to retaliate on those worse than savages! On application from General Washington, Sir Wm Howe consented that he should send in an officer to see how our soldiers were treated whereupon one was sent to the City, but Sir Wm denied him admission saying that he need not give himself any concern about the prisoners, that he would take care of them, I believe we shall take care how Sir Wm's commissaries of prisoners are allowed to go about the States providing for and taking care of the prisoners in our hands. Congress have passed a resolve that all their supplies shall be paid for in gold and silver in solid coin.  About 100 of the enemy from New York under the cover of a dark night not long since set fire to several houses in Philip's Manor within about four miles of General Parson's encampment, seized their inhabitants, stripped them naked both men & women and led them with halters round their necks in hellish triumph to New York. Genl Parsons remonstrated in a firm manly tone to Govr General Tryon on this occasion and was answered by him in an insolent haughty letter vindicating his barbarity and threatening destruction   against the rebels as he had the impudence to call us especially against Committee men. One of the houses that were burnt by his order belonged to a Committee man. General Parsons replied by setting fire to General Delancey's fine seat within the enemy's lines & about five miles of the City which utterly consumed it with all it's valuable furniture. Among the prisoners we have made in that quarter is Mr James Delancey who was taken in Maurisania and who went over to the enemy since the Declaration of Independency. Congress have ordered him to be delivered over to the Executive Order of New York to be dealt with as to Law shall appertain. Col Rollins who was taken in Fort Washington, Lt Col Livingston at Fort Montgomery and Major Stewart at Staten Island lately made their escape from a guardship on board of which they had been but a few days before confined. Col Rollins who hath been before Congress confirmed the account we have had of the cruel treatment our officers & Soldiers had rec'd at New York, says that while the officers were on their parole at Long Island they were billetted on the inhabitants and fared pretty well. That they were all lately put on board guardship with what view he could not tell, nor can I, but I conjecture from the enemy's contracting and collecting their force towards a point in New York that they have sent all the reinforcement from thence they could spare to Sir Wm Howe and that under apprehensions of an attack from General Putnam they have drawn from Long Island a great part of the force they had there to support New York; in this case they would not choose to leave our officers on that Island. If my conjectures should be right it might be well to make an attack on New York this winter, or at least an expedition to Long Island. It is necessary to have some expedition or other on foot constantly not only to keep our enemies in perpetual alarm but to engage & employ the minds of the people, which might otherwise by brooding over the calamities of War, become gloomy and indisposed to vigorous efforts. If any should be undertaken this winter I hope they will be better conducted than that against Rhode Island. Congress have appointed a Committee to enquire into the cause of the failure of that expedition of whom you are one. I hope that you will undertake and that your inquiry will be severe. Your old Captain Caleb Gardner entered upon that expedition as a volunteer with great spirit. I could wish that he might be summoned by the Committee. He can give you good information into the conduct of that affair and can tell you particularly why a descent was not made on the Island on Saturday night, the 1 8th of October last. There could not be a finer time for the purpose; and I was that day near Howland's ferry where I was well informed that all things were ready for an attack and that nothing was wanting but a favourable night. As I look upon this war, on our side to be a holy War, I can't conceive with submission to the righteous judgment of the Revd.  ______ Hopkin's, who it seems was Chaplain and Counsellor to General Spencer why an attack might not have been made that night without violating the commandments of Heaven. But it seems that the holiness of Saturday night prevented an attempt being made.  By the best account I can get there is no prospect of a French War. We must fight our way to Independency alone. We should be abundantly competent for it, if we could be persuaded to stand forth as one man. Indeed as it is, notwithstanding the disaffection in this State and the want of civil power occasioned by the contests about a Constitution of Govt, the depreciation of our money, and the prevalence of avarice and extortion, We shall I don't doubt be able to struggle through the War. Such measures are taken to restore the credit of Continental money, and to check the lust of gain as I have reason to think will succeed. I am not at liberty to tell you on what I principally rely for the effecting the former. The measures recommended to the several States if gone into will effect the latter. Nothing but a severe scourging will bring the inhabitants of this State to their senses and I think between the two armies they will have enough of that. Congress are for pursuing spirited measures. Some recommendations they may give to the States may be thought inconsistent with the rights of individuals, but necessity and the accomplishment of the most noble intentions, will I hope in their opinion warrant what at another time and upon a less occasion might be thought unjustifiable. Virginia hath passed a Law to prevent monopolizing &c and to seize upon all woolens &c for sale fit for clothing our soldiers in the Continental Army, in consequence of which several seizures have been actually made in several parts of that country of the very articles they were in immediate want of to the amount of upwards of £20,000. If similar measures should be taken in every State, and a check could be given to sharping, extortion and engrossing, we might easily clothe and victual our Army; and what ammunition and warlike stores we may reasonably expect from foreign parts; although we may not have reason to expect a War between France and Britain. For my own part although the war might be protracted, which I dont think would be the case if France should make war with Britain and although our public debt may be increased by our contending alone, yet I had rather that this should take place than that we should drag France into a war by entering into such treaties and laying ourselves under such obligations as might embarass us and in the long run prove highly injurious to the United States of America. Britain has no prospects of reinforcements to her armies from Prussia, and it seems that Germany is sick of depopulating her States by selling her inhabitants to be sent into distant regions from whence but a few of them will ever return. Britain may perhaps draw some Roman Catholic recruits from Ireland and a few may be collected in Scotland, but with all she can any way collect I cant conceive that   she will be able to send into the field the next campaign an army equal to our's. Our naval force I hope the next Spring will be greater than it is at present, and that department better conducted. The Eastern Navy Board are empowered to suspend Officers (3) and I hope if what is said be true will suspend McNeal. I read the paragraph of your letter relating to Marine matters to the Marine Committee. They liked the hint; but you know that Committee. I wish you were here; that Committee particularly wants your services. Your military talents I am not acquainted with, but I know your ability in the Naval Department. It was this, that induced me as you may remember to solicit you to suffer yourself to be nominated one of the Navy Board in the Eastern Department. If you should not come again to Congress I hope I shall have the pleasure of seeing you of that Board, when an opportunity shall offer for electing a member.  I have not heard a word lately about the fish I desired you to procure for me and my friends. Please to keep it in remembrance and whenever you can purchase them do not fail to do it.  Present my regards to Mr Stevens when you see him and to Capt John Flagg and any other inquiring friend at Portsmouth. Adieu Dear Sir, be happy and believe me to be, yours sincerely,  Wm Ellery P.S. I am just this moment informed that our Army will hut this winter at Valley Forge about 20 miles from Philadelphia and near Schuylkill. The Rawleigh and Alfred are arrived in France Sc carried in two Jamaica vessels which sold for 9,000 Stg. ""

  My dear Sir, York Town Decr. 22d. 1777 Tho. the times are dull, yet its so long since I had any converse with you, that I cant help asking how you do. Your time I suppose passes sweetly on, surrounded with all the delicacies of Boston, and uninterrupted with the rude alarms of War, but is not your happiness sometimes broke in upon by the spirit of extortion which rages in your City?  In the midst of my protesting & swearing that they were the most infamous, vile, execrable, extortionate villains in this State, of any in the whole world; that they woud soon effect what the British arms had in vain attempted; in pops a Letter from our Clothing Agent at Boston informing that it was impossible to procure any supplies, for that the moderate Merchts., & Whigs too! asked £20 for what cost one. Guess my surprize & concern: you who know my affection for your Country, will readily believe I wd. not give credit to it, 'till the Letter was read twice. How happens this my friend? is Joyce Junr. no more?  To be serious, we are absolutely ruined, unless a remedy is found for this Evil. The Virginia Assembly is exerting itself. They have seized sufficient for their troops in the hands of Ingrossers, have passed a severe Law against them, & appointed a Comtee. of their body to hunt them out & prosecute. They have determined to fill up DECEMBER 22, 1777  their Regts. by drafts from the young men & have laid a heavier tax than I fear they will be able to bear. The monied wretches from the other States have polluted your City; drive them off, & purify your people. By Letters from my two brors. from France we have no reason to expect any of the burthen will be taken off our Shoulders by the powers of Europe. We do not want it if we will exert our own strength. The campaign in this quarter has to be sure been very disgracefull, but we have a great many men now inlisted tho scatter'd & disordered. I hope we shall find means to collect them & introduce some (Economy & discipline; And if the States will draw the Reins of Governmt. a little tight, check the insatiable rage of avarice, & rouse their people from the present total inattention to public affairs; I make no doubt we shall put a glorious period to the contest the next campaign. Our enemy is not near so strong as heretofore & no prospect of ever becoming so; America in my opinion is stronger then ever. And yet all is lost unless our people are reclaimed. I have this day a Letr. from Wmsburg. dated Decr. 12, which has the following paragraph, which looks well. \""A Vessell in 12 Days from Hispaniola brings advice, that a large Spanish fleet was arrived at that place with 12000 Soldiers; & their destination was supposed against Jamaica.

  Sir York Town 23d December 1777. I am directed by Congress to transmit to your honorable body, the enclosed resolutions, which the pressing wants of the army, & the arts & avarice of engrossers & extortioners have rendered indispensibly necessary to the general welfare.(1)  It is with deep concern that Congress after having for some time contemplated in painful silence the mischiefs which threaten this extended continent from the growing avarice of the times, feel themselves constrained to recommend measures, which the virtue of all classes of men rendered not long since, unnecessary, & which a scrupulous regard for the security of property to every citizen of these States has hitherto restrained them from adopting; but (unhappy the case of America) Laws unworthy the character of infant republics are become necessary to supply the defect of public virtue, & to correct the vices of some of her sons; & she is called upon by the grand principle of self preservation to guard against the parricide of those, whom she has fostered in her own bosom.  To minds, whose reflections are employed on the importance of the cause in which we are engaged, & which feel for every circumstance which may affect the honor and safety of these States, it must give the most painful sensations to consider, that at a time when the late signal successes we have been blest with, the reduced numbers of the enemy, the difficulties they meet with in procuring foreign levies, & the political complexion of affairs in Europe, have deprived Britain of many of those resources, on which she has so much depended; when the numbers & improving discipline of our army, the prodigious augmentation of our military stores, the quantity of  DECEMBER 23, 1777  provisions, with which this country abounds, & the large supplies of cloathing, which have of late been imported by private persons afford not only the opportunity but the means, under divine providence, of establishing our liberties by a few exertions, this bright prospect should be clouded over, & this great & glorious event endangered, by the languor of too many, & by the arts & avarice of designing individuals, who like the British Nabobs of the East, are corrupting the manners of a whole nation, & building vast fortunes on the destruction of the liberties of the Western World.  It is to be hoped however, that the wise & spirited laws of the different States, aided by the influence & exertions of the real patriots, will apply effectual remedies to these alarming evils; that the old & hardened offenders will be punished, that those in whose bosoms the sparks of public virtue are not yet extinguished, will be reclaimed; the languid roused from their present apathy; & that all classes of men will unite with their former spirit & virtue against an enemy, whose progress is marked with every vestige of barbarity, & whose determined object is to establish a tyranny of the most dangerous & debasing nature over the inhabitants of a vast continent.  Congress flatter themselves that the resolutions herewith transmitted will tend to accomplish some of these valuable purposes, & they therefore esteem it their duty to recommend them to the serious consideration of your honourable house,(2) & hope they will be carried into execution, as expeditiously & secretly as possible.

Carolina, where, according to a Resolve of Congress the Value of Vessel & Cargo were adjudged prize to the Captors.(1) This Resolve was founded on the practice of the British Court for encouraging infidelity & treachery among our Seamen.

  Dear Sir, Dec 23d 1777. I have rec'd your favor by Mr Storer and was exceedingly pleased with the invoice of a newly arrived cargo, but I would not have you think that the live stock mentioned in your letter created any part of my pleasure-quite the reverse, I assure you. You will have officers on furlough from the grand army to give an history of their own feats so that I need not dwell upon that topic. I will only say that it is determined to hut at and near Sweed's Ford. You seem most to expect from me foreign news. It is strange that we have had no letters from the Commissioners since the 26th of May last. It is true we have a small epistle from A.L.-Dated Berlin June DECEMBER 23, 1777  and some letters from him and his brother Wm (1) dated July 31st and Sept 3d, all discouraging as to the temper of the European Courts, they being full of professions of friendship and declarations of being interested in our success, and therefore ardently wishing it while nothing can move them from their qualms and caution which are carried to a very ridiculous length. Spain is said to be engaged only about her little Portuguese War. France is governed by timidity and the three great Northern powers are immersed in schemes of plundering the Turk and the Pole and dividing the spoils; while Europe is in this temper, though the justice of our cause has made all men unanimous in our favor, it is not wonderful (says our friend) that we are left like Hercules in his cradle to strangle the serpent that is the terror of Europe.  \""You Sir with Mr Lee will think it happy for us that the fears and occupations of the powers of Europe have prevented them from forming treaties with us when our situation would have given them infinite advantages.  \""When our distresses are past and our fears subsided, we shall be enabled to see and to follow our interests in the alliances we form, which I do not think would be entirely the case at present.\""(2)  I have written this to you in confidence for really Bingham's letter of Octr 13th may have good ministerial intelligence which merchants at Nantes might not know on Sept 5th which is the date of a letter to Mr Geary from a young man who says the French Court \""is still acting a cowardly part.\""  Please to present my love to your brother and lady acknowledging the receipt of his kind letter of the 3d. Present also my best compliments to your Miss Whipple and believe me, your affectionate friend, J.L.  ""

  Dear Sir Dec 23d 1777 After Sealing the enclosed I rec'd a letter from a friend at Nantes dated Oct 18th which goes near to destroy my argumentation about Bingham's letter.(1) I say near because the intelligence from Newfoundland accords with the last part of my friend's letter.  The Randolph and Alfred arrived at L'Orient the 6th of Octr. having taken two Jamaicamen which they sold privately for 9700  DECEMBER 24, 1777  Sterling. Biddle's prizes are not those which the papers speak of as claimed. Those were taken by Capt Kendrick a vessel from Massachusetts.  My friend writes that two Jamaicamen he susposed would be restored to the English having been seized by the Admiralty. Prizes, it is true, are sold but under value. The policy of the Nation and the interest of Individuals go hand in hand.  \""It is pretended that when their Baltic Ships and fishermen were in they will speak in a different tone to the English. Two or three months will convince us whether these professions are sincere or not, but I apprehend some singular success in America would be a more weighty argument in our favor than any other circumstance whatever.\""  ""

  Dear Sir, York 24th December 1777 I hope this will meet you perfectly happy in domestic enjoyments. Nothing I have at present to offer is intended to interrupt them one moment. I bring you tokens of peace, good will & benevolence.  The Eagle Tail & Rattle Trap nicely Cased up are put into a Waggon now bound to Albany with public Money, under the protection of Peter Webber, who will deliver them to your order. When these are presented to the Sachems of the Six Nations, you may assure them upon the best grounds, that the Creek Indians have driven out of their Towns, Cameron & Tait, two Agents under the King's Superintendent of Indian affairs, & forbid their return at the peril of their Lives. The Indians had Seized & divided among them 100 Horse loads of Goods, which John Stuart the Superintendent had sent in order to bribe them to go to War against Georgia & So. Carolina-after the flight & arrival of the Agents at Pansacola-Mr. Stuart sent in a Peace Talk proposing to forgive the Creeks for the Insults & plunder which they had committed, provided they would readmit his Agents who should in such Case return with hands full of presents, & drive out the Traders & Agents from So. Carolina, who, he attempted to insinuate, could not long Supply their wants of Clothing & other goods. The Indians replied, he had too often told them lies, they would no longer be deceived by him nor his Emissaries, nor would they quarrel with their old friends again.  Mr. President Rutledge writes me, that the little Carpenter & the DECEMBER 24, 1777  Great Warrior from the Cherokees, two Men of the first influence in that Nation, were actually on the Road to Charles Town-I suppose to renew the Treaty of Peace & brighten the Chain-& adds that Indian affairs in general wore a favorable aspect.  A Vessel containing 70 Hogsheads of Rum & 6 Hogsheads of Sugar with some other goods intended from Granada to New York for the use of the Enemy had been carried into Charles Town by the Mate & Crew, who had dispossessed the Master of Command. The whole was adjudged, in pursuance of the Resolution of Congress, prize to the Captors.(1) This is the first retort upon that Species of British policy calculated for encouraging infidelity & Treachery among Seamen in the service of these States. I have no doubt but that in a few Months they will experience an hundred fold retaliation of their infamous Example-which nothing but dire necessity could have induced virtuous Americans to Copy.  If there is nothing amiss good Sir in all that is Said what follows will please you more.  Two or three days ago I received a Letter from a Correspondent in Charles Town containing these Sympathetic sentiments. \""A poor Brother Type, John Holt I fear has been ruined by the infamous conduct of the Savage Vaughan.(2) I would wish to aid him in his distress which may be the more acceptable at this juncture, when perhaps his friends may be reduced to Similar circumstances with himself. You will do me a Singular kindness if his Situation is such as I apprehend it must be, if you will take the trouble of remitting him two hundred Dollars on my Account. I would not use this freedom could I procure a Bill just now. You will add to the obligation if you will accompany the Remittance with a Line informing him it comes from a person who will make himself known when Times are better.\""  I recollect you shewed me a Letter in Congress from the unfortunate Mr. Holt, which together with my ignorance of the place of his abode, has induced me to trouble you on this occasion. I know you will be so good as to give him the necessary information adding to the above that I will honour his draught upon sight for the Sum above mentioned, or if he pleases to draw for Three hundred Dollars I will find out a person who will chearfully add the latter hundred without Account. If it be more agreeable I will send three hundred Dollars directly to him when I am informed of his Address.  I am a little Indebted to one of the New York Printers to whom you were so good as to introduce me. If Mr. Holt is the Man, I cannot wonder, but if any other, I would request you at your Leisure & Convenience to enquire why he has not sent me a News paper since we left Philadelphia & if he will inform me the amount of my debt, I will take means immediately for discharging it.  I wont be so rude as to tell you that I am writing in Bed where I  have been closely confined Sixteen Days past by a heavy attack of the Gout in both feet.

I am sorely hurt by his Conduct and mortifyed to the very Soul of it, for yesterday I received further letters respecting him, by which I perceive the Commissioners are about making a representation of him to Congress that may hurt me unless my readiness to discharge him on the first certainty I received of his III behaviour is previously made known, therefore I hope Mr Smith will lay those letters before them telling when he got 'em.

Coll.

I beg Council will take this Case under their particular notice and shield this Lady at least from the indiscretion of an Officer until they can come to a deliberate resolution, for being only with a female friend equally deprived, and on the same account, of the advice and protection of their most near friends, who are with the Enemy, deserves particular attention, which I take the Liberty to recommend to the Honble Council and thro them to the Legislature as the greatest obligation they can lay on me.(4) I am most respectfully, Sir, Yr. most ob. hume.

  Sir, York Town, Decr 26th 1777. When what is proposed has for its object the Comfort and advantage of the sick & wounded in the American Hospitals, I can need no Apology for the Liberty I have taken in writing to you. By favour of Mr Duer I have sent you a Pound of Sago,(1) the produce of the State of Georgia, which I would recommend to your Examination; as you will perceive by the Pamphlet herewith transmitted, it has met with the Approbation of several eminent & learned Physicians in Europe.  Mr Samuel Bowen the Patentee of this Sago has for some years past resided in Georgia, where he made his experiments & brought the Sago Powder to perfection, equal to that from the East Indies. In the Year 1773 he left Georgia, & took with him several kinds of Seeds, Plants &c in order to lay them before the royal Society; by a Letter received from him soon after his arrival in London, it appeared, that he had received a Gold Medal, as a premium for extracting Oil from Benniseed. Since this Time his family have received no Letters from him, occasioned by the unhappy disputes that have subsisted between Great Britain and America, & the Georgia Letters have been intercepted by the Governor of East Florida, at St. Augustine.  Mrs Bowen, his wife has continued the manufacture of the Sago &c on his Plantation & makes about 150 Barrels per Annum, which She has sold to the French Vessels & others that have brought in their Cargoes to the Port of Savannah.  Having been very intimate with the Family for several Years & being appointed one of the Delegates for the State of Georgia, I proposed to Mrs Bowen to make known her manufacture to the Continental Congress, that if it met with their Approbation, the American Army and Navy might be supplied therewith. I have however previous to any Application to Congress thought proper to communicate this to you & should be extremely happy to have your Opinion on this matter, whether you think it would not be proper to adopt the use of this powder into the American Hospitals; its Price is very reasonable, and as it is the produce of the Continent, it is certainly an Object worthy of encouragement & protection.  I was in London in the Year 1768 & to my certain knowledge at that time Bowen's Sago Powder was used by many eminent Physicians & I have been informed from good Authority, that the East India Company had made proposals to Mr. Bowen, in order to prevent him from carrying on this manufacture.

  Sir Manheim December 26th. 1777 On the 17th Inst. I received at this place two letters from my Friend Mr. John Ross dated in Nantes the 2d of August & 20th of Septr. which came Via Virginia, in a Sloop called the Congress lately arrived there. These letters were written for the purpose of making me acquainted with the unworthy conduct of my Brother Mr. Thos. Morris in Nantes & their contents shocked me to the very Soul, I perceived instantly how grossly I had long been imposed on & deemed it my duty to have him immediately discharged from the Agency in which he was employed for the Public. Accordingly I wrote that very day to the Honble Wm. Smith Esq. a Member of the Commercial Committee,(1) an Account of this intelligence & enclosing a letter for Mr. Thos. Morris, one for Messrs. Pliarne, Penet & Co. & another for Mr. J. Gruel, requesting they might be signed if approved by the Committee & dispatched in order that Mr. Morris might be dismissed & the business that had passed under his direction be brought to a settlement soon as possible. All these letters I wished to have laid before the Congress for their approbation; and in order to prove that I had not a wish to retain my Brother in the Public service one moment after I knew him to be unworthy of the employ. I then thought those letters wou'd be all that was necessary on the occasion & and that my Brothers dismission would have wiped away the discredit his conduct had brought on our Commercial department & the final settlement of the Accounts have ended the disgrace he had brought on me, leaving only himself the Victim of his Folly. But on the 23d Inst. I received several letters from Mr. Deane, by the Eastern Post, wrote in consequence of one that I had unfortunately written to him the 29th June last, whilst under the influence of an unjust and erroneous opinion that the Commissioners had used my Brother very cruelly in their manner of mentioning him to Congress. In this letter I censured them freely, believing that I had sufficient reason for doing so. These censures & the very unwarrantable use Mr. Thos. Morris made of the letter, has excited the keenest resentment of the Commissioners against me, & I confess as things are really circumstanced I am not surprized at it. This resentment has impelled them to put the harshest interpretation on some passages in my letter & to represent my conduct in respect to my Brother in colours it does not deserve.  The receipt of these letters distressed me exceedingly because I had been convinced by Mr. Ross that I was in the wrong with respect to the Commissioners, & had determined to acknowledge it fully & freely to them; but on finding that altho' my letter to Mr. Deane was a private one, and his to me the same, yet he desired I shou'd lay his before Congress. It was compelling me to open before that August DECEMBER 26, 1777  Body a dispute that I thought they ought not to be troubled with, yet as his letters insinuate many charges against me, I concluded to comply with his request and Vindicate myself against insinuations & reflections not founded in Justice or reality.(2) I find however by a letter received yesterday, that Copies of these letters from Mr. Deane to me have already been read in Congress, consequently that it is unnecessary for me to bring the Original; & my design in giving you Sir, the trouble of Reading & Congress of hearing this letter, is not to recriminate on Mr. Deane, but to justify myself & this I propose to do by a plain Narrative of the Facts that have led me into the present embarrasments & I must beg a patient & candid hearing from you and them.  Mr. Thos. Morris & myself are descended from a Father whose Virtue & whose Memory I have ever revered with the most Filial Piety. Our Mothers were not the same & this youth was born after our Father's decease, without any sufficient provision made for his maintenance. The tender regard I bore to the Parent, I determined when very young to extend to his Offspring, & no sooner had I fixed myself in the World than I took charge of this Brother. I gave him the best Education that cou'd be obtained in Philadelphia, & took as much care of his Morals as my time & capacity enabled. When he was arrived at a proper Age I took him into my Counting House to instruct him in the profession from which he was to draw his future support. In this situation he remained about three years, during which time he discovered on all occasions a good Understanding, sound judgment & clear Head, with remarkable facility in dispatching business. His behaviour was then Modest & Innocent, his Heart pure, & he possessed a Mind strongly Actuated by principals of Honor, at least these were the opinions I had formed, & such was the Character he bore amongst his own acquaintance, from hence I formed the most pleasing expectation, & saw but one source from whence any reverse cou'd spring. This was a fondness he early discovered of being the head of his Company, a disposition more dangerous to youth than any other & which in fact has been his ruin. This it was that first led him to seek improper Company, who readily granting him the preeminence he delighted in, soon carried him into the practice of their Follies & Vices. When I discovered this to be the case & found that advice had not its proper weight, and thinking frequent exercise of Authority might be dangerous, I fell on the expedient of sending him to Spain (in order to break off his connection with Worthless Companions) & there placed him in an eminent Counting House where he gained much knowledge & experience & where he acquired the French & Spanish Languages so as to write & Speak both with great fluency. At a proper season I recalled him to America & took him a Partner in our House, promising myself assistance & relief from his abilities & expected assiduity; & for some time had great satisfaction   in him, but unfortunately his former associates found him out & again led him astray. At this period the Commercial business of America was interrupted by certain resolutions of Congress, & fearing that Idle time & these associates wou'd bring him to ruin, I determined on sending him to Europe well recommended with Money in his Pocket, in hopes to open his mind, extend his Ideas & give him a habit of keeping & seeking good Company. He travelled through Spain, Italy & into France with reputation kept by means of introductions. I procured for him the best Company at every place he went to, & I had the pleasure to receive many letters from my Friends as well as from himself in the most satisfactory Stile. These letters, his assurances, & those from some Friends on his behalf, regained my confidence & I judged he had now arrived at the period of proper reflection, for such usually happens to young People who have been too Volatile in the first Stages of Manhood. At this Period it happened that a Commercial Agent became necessary to have a general superintendancy of the Public business in Europe. My Brother was then in France (as I thought) possessed of my good opinion, & reflecting that he was qualified for that Agency by his Education in two Counting Houses where he had seen & executed much business, by his perfect knowledge of the Languages, & by his being connected with some of the best Mercantile Houses in Europe & known to many more, I was prompted to offer his services to the Committee, firmly believing he wou'd be extreamly usefull & do honor to himself & me. Here I must observe that no part of his conduct had ever given me the least cause to suspect any want of integrity or breach of Honor, therefore, the only doubts I did or cou'd entertain, was wether he wou'd bestow that attention that he ought to this business; & for this I depended on the assurances he had given in his letters of a faithfull execution of any commands I might lay on him. The Committee, of which Doctr. Franklin was then a Member, was pleased to accept the offer, & on the Doctrs. going to France, he promised me to become a Friend & adviser to my Brother if he found it necessary. Mr. Deane had promised this before his departure & to make me acquainted with his conduct. I reposed myself in confidence that he cou'd not do any harm (as I shou'd soon hear how he managed & cou'd Act accordingly) & he might do much good. At the same time that I recommended him to the Agency I intrusted him to collect the debts due to our House in Europe & pay the ballances we might owe there, & since then have continued to employ him in the management of our own business. This must convince every person that I had full confidence in him, as I wou'd not have intrusted my own property & affairs in what I cou'd think doubtfull hands.  I have given this long detail to shew the Foundation on which I recommended my Brother to his employment & I think any other  person in my situation wou'd have done the same thing, however if I am any ways culpable in having done so, it is the event & not the intention that makes me so, for cou'd I have had the least Idea of what has happened, I wou'd sooner have perished than he shou'd have been trusted. The next thing I am blamed for is granting greater faith to my Brothers representations than to the Commissioners letters This was only the case in part, for I had other evidence than his letters, however I must also account for my conduct in this respect by a detail of circumstances. It happened very unfortunately that about the time Thos. Morris was appointed in America to this Agency, he had gone from France to London where totally unable to withstand the tempting scenes of pleasure that sink of Iniquity affords, he gave in to the pursuit with an eagerness (as I am now informed) that debauched his mind & laid the foundation for all that has since happened. He was in London at the time his letters of appointment arrived at Paris. Mr. Deane sent for him. He came & promised a faithful attention to business, he repaired to Nantes & finding Mr. Penet had been intrusted with a Contract for Public business, part of which had been executed, he readily fell into the proposals made by that House & became a party in it (but on what terms I do not know). Consequently he put the Public business into their hands (which was not inconsistant with the instructions under which he Acted). Whilst things were in this train in France, I recd. a letter from the Gentn. in Cadiz with whom my Brother had lived, a worthy Man who had great regard for him & wished to promote his welfare. He gave me reason to suppose his conduct in London had been out of Character & this gave the first alarm to my fears.  In consequence of which I wrote letters on the 31st Jany last to Mr. Deane, to Mr. Ross & to T. Morris, informing them of this intelligence & pressing their immediate care of & attention to the Public business shou'd he neglect it; I requested my Friend Ross to visit France on purpose to watch & inform me truely what was his conduct & insisted to my Brother that if he had been guilty of any neglect of duty or misconduct in discharge of his Public Trust, that he shou'd resign it into the hands of Mr. Deane or Mr. Ross, empowering them regularly to Act for him untill new arrangements were made This done, I waited impatiently for the event. In the mean time, some disputes & mutual Complaints had arisen between Mr. Deane and my Brother, & on the arrival of the above letters the latter went to Paris, where they so far settled matters that he returned to Nantes with Mr. Deanes sanction (Mr. Ross being at Hamburg did not arrive untill long after). Some Ships arrived from Philada. at Nantes about this time with Cargoes on Public Account Consigned to the order of Thos. Morris, particularly the Success, Capt. Anderson, and Elizabeth & Mary, Capt. Young. By the return of one or both of these (I think) came letters from the Commissioners, saying to the   best of my remembrance \""that Mr. Thos. Morris must be immediately displaced from his Agency\"" & another quoting the Paragraph of Doctr. Lee's letter from Bordeaux. Having no private letter then from Mr. Deane on this Subject, I was astonished at the Stile of these to Congress, for supposing my Brother guilty of some inattention, which was the most I did suppose, I could not think it right to blast entirely a young Mans reputation that was just setting out in the World, meerly because he was fond of pleasure; & as the letters he had written respecting the business under his care were full & clear they were produced to Congress in his justification & to prevent any hasty measures. I then related to Congress the substance of what I have now written but not so fully, & many Members as well as myself were surprized at the affair as it then stood. In consequence of what the Commissioners had wrote, I referred myself to Mr. Thos. Morris's private letters more particularly, & found there was no good understanding between Mr. Deane & him (but of Doctor Franklin he wrote respectfully) & he intimated that Mr. Deane was privately his Enemy. Not trusting however to his letters, I applyed to several persons that came from Nantes, who assured me there was nothing amiss in his conduct that they knew or heard of, but more particularly one person who had transacted business with him. This Gentn. assured me over & over that he lived two Months in the House with my Brother, that he saw him assiduous, attentive, & industrious, that if it had not been for him, the business of those Ships wou'd not have been done in any reasonable time & that I might depend my Brother wou'd give entire satisfaction, at least he was fully perswaded of this. He said he knew well there was persons in France that envied his appointment & wou'd leave nothing undone to have him displaced & particularly mentioned Mr. Williams who he heard was Nephew to one & concerned in Trade with another of the Commissioners as the person intended to supply his place. The relator of this Account is now in America, a man of Character, sensible, & Capable for his sphere of Life, & when Mr. Deane arrives he shall have the satisfaction of seeing & examining him; 'till then I think it best to keep his Name for my own sake.  This relation & others less full, my Brother's & other letters & Mr. Deane's silence, led me to give some Credit to the Story, & altho' I was ever willing to displace my Brother on the least just cause appearing, yet I confess I did not like that he shou'd be sacrificed to make room for another person, & when Mr. Deane's first letters on the subject of my Brother did arrive, they did not remove the impressions I had received. Still I had not full confidence that some cause for what was written had not been given on his part, & I supposed his neglect or misconduct to have been magnifyed in the Account given thereof to the Commissioners, who cou'd not have been Eye Witnesses. In this situation, I wrote the letter of the 29th June that has so irritated them, telling very fully what I heard & censuring freely  what I thought wrong. Before I sent this letter I shewed it to some Members of Congress, relating truly as I have now done the circumstances that induced me to write it, & they thought me right as things then appeared. When Mr. Ross arrived at Nantes he advised me of it & promised immediately to enter into an examination of my Brothers conduct & give me a faithfull Account of it, but he was above ten Weeks there before he wrote that Account & I do suppose was trying what he could do by exhortation &ca. At last the shocking account came on the 17th Inst. & that day I requested my Brother might be dismissed from his employment, giving notice to Congress of his Malconduct.  Here, Sir, I have given a Candid account of my reasons for introducing this unhappy Man into Public employ & for not sooner soliciting his dismission. I did the first in hopes of his being servicable to the Public, at the same time that he wou'd enjoy an honorable & beneficial employment. I have done the latter as soon as I was convinced it ought to be done. Untill now I had no conception that it was possible for him to Act the part he has done, & nothing carries stronger conviction of his being irretrievably lost than his behaviour with my letter of the 29th June. Congress will observe that Mr. Deane complains of my having urged him to resent the injury's I believed they had done him. The Paragraph of my said letter to Mr. Deane on that subject is as follows. \""I think those Public letters were cruel to my Brother & extremely unfriendly to myself. I shall inform him of them & if he has Spirit to resent them I hope he will also have judgment to do it properly.\""  This letter was enclosed to my Brother with the following Paragraph \""I now wait with impatience to learn the result of your journey with Capt. Bell to Paris, for on that & your future conduct depends your Commission as Commercial Agent to the United States of America, & I find there are those that envy you that appointment & wish it out of your hands as you may see by the enclosed letter for Silas Deane Esqr. which I send open for your perusal, & if you can determine to merit the continuance of that Commission by good behaviour I think I can maintain it for you in spite of all endeavours to the contrary, but if you will not deserve it, I shall be the first to take it from you & in that case it wou'd hardly be worth while sending the letter to Mr. Deane, only that there are some Commercial matters in it. Therefore you must Seal & send it to him. As to what I have said about your resenting their letters, I think you had best not think of any thing of that kind, least your past behaviour will not support you in doing it, & the best satisfaction you can have will be by holding your post under such good conduct as will deter them from attacking you again.\""  Thus, Sir, you will observe I only hinted resentment in the letter to Mr. Deane, & in fact retracted the Idea in this to T. M. & I   solemnly declare these are the only lines I ever wrote in that stile. Here it also appears that my design was to have the letter delivered immediately without any person seeing it but Mr. Deane & himself. Had that been done you wou'd not have been troubled on the occasion, but it wou'd have remained a private affair. The other charges and insinuations are chiefly founded on the Ill use Mr. Thos. Morris made of this letter on conjecture & on misinformation. If Mr. Deane had seen the whole of that long private letter he speaks of, he wou'd have seen how false & groundless the several stories told him of it were. Indeed, the Contents of that letter except the Paragraph above quoted wou'd Ill suit T. M. to shew any one, for knowing his own conduct they must have stung him to the Soul every time he read 'em unless his Soul was grown too Callous to have a feeling left.  Mr. Deane seems to remark on my private letters requesting him to displace T. M. from his employment if found unworthy of it, as if I meant thereby to exercise an undue authority as Member of Congress, but this is a strained construction. The only authority I must or cou'd mean to exercise was that of an Elder Brother over a younger, dependant on him for his support & accountable to him for his conduct, & under this Idea I insisted that he shou'd empower Mr. Deane or Mr. Ross to Act in his stead & under his Authority if they thought it necessary, which shews I had no design of exercising any other authority than the infiuence I expected my letters as an individual wou'd have had on my Brother, & I still think if these had been insisted on at that time, he wou'd have yielded to them. As to the expressions I used \""of supporting him in his appointment if his conduct wou'd justify it; & that all the Commissioners together shou'd not remove him if he did his duty &ca.\"" they may have been too strong, but I was writing these under the influence of a (groundless) belief that they had done him injustice & I knew Congress wou'd not displace him or any of their Servants that did their duty.  Upon the whole this was a private letter that has produced these animadversions on my conduct & therefore not wrote with any particular guard or caution, but it adds very much to the distress & unhappiness this unworthy Young Man has involved me in, to think I shou'd have passed censures on Doctr. Franklin & Mr. Deane (Doctr. Lee was not mentioned) which they did not deserve. I did it under a deception that most Men of feeling wou'd have fallen into, & I shall as freely own it to them as I do to you, holding it more honorable to acknowledge an error & attone for any injuries produced by it, than with a Vindictive Spirit to persist because you happen to have committed it. The Account given both by Mr. Ross & Mr. Deane of Mr. T. Morris's conduct so far surpasses any thing that I cou'd have an Idea of, that I do not pretend to animadvert on any part of it. My distress is more than I can describe; to think that in the midst of the most ardent exertions I was capable of  making to promote the Interest & welfare of my Country I shou'd be the means of introducing a Worthless Wretch to disgrace & discredit it, is too much to bear. I hope however that no pecuniary loss will happen to the Public & that the disgrace and discredit will be wiped away by his dismission. From this hour I renounce all connection with him, altho I cannot help lamenting the loss of what he was capable of being. I shall enclose Mr. Deane a Copy of this letter for his satisfaction & make what I think suitable acknowledgments to both Doctr. Franklin & him.  Should Congress think there is any thing more on my part to be done, I am ready to obey their orders,(3) & with the greatest respect remain, Sir, Your most Obedt. Servt. Robt Morris  ""

  Sir, York Town Decr. 26th. 1777 A letter is just come to hand giving the most melancholy discription of the situation of our army on account of difficiencies in the Commissary's and Qr. master's Departments.(1) With respect to the article of cloathing 2800 are obliged to retire in a naked condition unfit alone from that consideration for duty, that he was about to apply a remedy by taking supernumerary articles particularly from the disaffected agreeable to a resolve of Congress,(2) but desisted on an assurance from a Committee of this State that provision would be made without delay in a manner more to the satisfaction of the Inhabitants, but although their own Troops suffered in the most extream degree, either no supply had been sent, or so scanty that it did not deserve to be mentioned. Thus much from memory, I intend Council an extract of the Letter if I can obtain it. This is no time for recrimination otherwise I could trace our present distress to other sources, and indeed Genl. Washington speaks out for the first time and charges the principle difficiency vizt. in the Commissarys department, to the arrangement made by Congress. I foresaw the Consiquences and withstood the measure but in vain. I conjure the State in an excentric way to provide flour and fat Cattle and to this end to employ men of integrity and activity in different parts in the vicinity of the army, otherwise I have no other prospect but that the army will be reduced to the necessity of abandoning their post and disperse. An Officer of  DECEMBER 27, 1777  merit writes to this Affect, that he could shed Tears of blood for the opportunities lost through want of provisions within these few days of cutting off the flower of the Brittish Army, in an excursion I think towards Chester. In short, our last advices say not a hoof of any kind was left & little or no flour. For the Lord's sake let us exert every nerve to save our Country, which must now be done by immediate supplies from this State until we get things into order. A late letter from France says the King had given orders to the Commissary of the port where two of our frigates were fitting to supply them out of his Arsinels.

  Sir, York Town 27th December 1777. I beg leave to refer you to the inclosed duplicate of a Letter which I had the honour of writing to you the 23d Inst. transmitted by the hand of a Mr. Storer.  Congress having received from General Gates as intimated in my last, Copy of a Letter written to him by Lieutt. General Burgoyne in which this Gentleman declares that \""the public faith is broke\"" &ca have taken this declaration together with his refusal, under an assertion not founded in truth, to give such descriptive marks of his Non Commissioned Officers, privates & other persons, as you had demanded, into their most serious consideration in a Committee of the whole House. These weighty & important circumstances after having long employed the close attention of a Select Committee has taken up almost the whole time of Congress for two days past, nor have the House yet accomplished all the solemn & necessary Resolutions which the Case demands, but have proceeded so far as to receive a Report from the Committee of the whole & to order me to Address you Sir, in terms of the Letter which you will find inclosed & of this which I am now penning; these will be followed as speedily as possible by extended Acts & Resolutions prepared for your further direction as well as for public information on both sides the Atlantic.(1) DECEMBER 27, 1777  Portrait of John Burgoyne  It is the express desire & injunction of Congress that you do not communicate the contents of these Letters to any person until it shall become absolutely necessary, that is to say, until you shall have received the intended Acts & Resolves or until you shall have attempted & if possible completed, certain essential Acts, admitting the Vessels for transporting Lt. General Burgoyne & his Troops to be arrived at the port of Boston.  By essential Acts, Congress mean, that the Tonnage of the Transport Vessels & also that the Stores of provisions & Fuel should be particularly enquired into & ascertained to be in your judgement Sufficient for transportation & sustenance of the number of persons intended to be embarked for a Voyage from Boston to Great Britain & more particularly that all accounts be liquidated & the Amount due by Lieutt. General Burgoyne or as great a part of it as you can obtain actually paid in Gold or Silver according to the rate specified in the Resolve of Congress of the 19th Inst.(2) transmitted in my last Letter in order to reduce within the Smallest compass articles which may hereafter be made subjects for cavil & disputation by the Court of Great Britain, on whose honour & justice these States cannot at present with any degree of safety rely.  These Acts which Congress judge indispensibly necessary to be performed before an embarkation can take place, will employ some days & gain so much time without subjecting the honour of the House or of its Constituents to any unfavorable imputation from the World. You will also from what has been said perceive good grounds for renewing your demand of the Names & particular description of the Non-Commissioned Officers, privates &ca but it may be prudent not to press this unless by appeal to expected directions from Congress & to the conduct of Sir Guy Carleton in the Instance adduced by Mr. Burgoyne & permit him if he pleases to decoy himself.(3) If When you shall have Sufficiently attempted or completed these necessary Acts you shall not have received the intended Resolves of Congress it will then be necessary for you to disclose the Contents of the Inclosed Letter to General Burgoyne & peremptorily to prohibit his embarkation until you shall have received further directions on that point.  You will understand the motive for dating that Letter January 1778 & leaving a Blank for the day to be properly & carefully filled by yourself.(4)  I have in conclusion to assure you Sir that Congress repose the highest confidence in your address & abilities for conducting with propriety this very important business, in which on one side the faith & honour of these Infant States are to be preserved & on the other the magnanimity & Resolution of Congress to be examplified in guarding against frauds & deceptions of an Enemy who has hitherto  practiced without remorse every Act of violence, injustice & Cruelty in the prosecution of the present War.

  Dear Sir York Pensylvania Decr. 28. 1777 Your favour of the 25 ulto Came to my hand this Moment. I am Sorry to hear of the death of Our friends Mabson, Waldron & Cray. I have not received one line from Hooper or Maclain god knows when, I beg you will make Interest with One or both of them to write to me. God send Our Assembly may have wisdom enough to fortify their Sea Ports, this Policy has been adopted by every State in the union except No. Carolina, the ridiculous Jelousy betwixt No. & South has I fear hitherto prevented it, had this been done two years sooner, Our State would have been as well Supplied with Necessaries from abroad as Charles Town, which of late has been the great Mart for the Supply of the Southern & middle States. I send you papers & refer you to them for News. I beg you will not publish any of my Scrawls, they are not written for the Press. Besides I sometimes mention to you some matters which are not proper to lay before the Public; since I have seen extracts from my letters published in the Wilmington Paper, It has made me very Cautious in giving my Opinion to my friends under my hand.  Our Grand Army are in hutts for the winter about 20 miles from Philadelphia in Order to Cover the Country from the Ravage & devastation of the Enemy. It is hoped we shall be able to Open the Campaign early in the Spring with Vigour; should the Several States exert themselves to fill up their Batalions we promise Ourselves to have a formidable Army in the field well provided & well dissiplined. I wrote you some time ago that I was sorry you had meddled with Kannons Bills, you had better send them on, the longer they remain behind, the greater will be the difficulty in receiving payment. I would not at present Choose to put my Money to Interest. Mrs Harnetts receipt shall be Sufficient for any sum not exceeding my proportion which you may think proper to pay her.  I have not heard from Mr. Mitchel about Jackey, I desired he would send him to me, or let me know where I could send for him, DECEMBER 28, 1777  I am sure he will not be safe at Burlington this winter, I must have him with me unless you Contradict it in your next. His bord & Schooling will be expensive to you any where in this Country, I think you had better let him Come home with me in the Spring. I desire you will be explicit on this Subject. I find you make a poor hand in the rum way. Jamaica spirits sells here at 80/, brown sugar 10/, Coffee 12/6, Lo Sugar 22/6. I shall take it as a favour if you will send me by the first Waggon Coming to this Town, 12 gallons Jama. rum, 1 Loaf Sugar, 12 lb brown & 12 lb Coffee, these articles would be a very great acquisition, the Sugar & Coffee Mrs. Harnett will supply you with, perhaps Coll Long can put you in the way to send these Articles forward, or some Colonel, or Other Officer in the Army; as recruits will no doubt be coming forward daily, pray do not Neglect this matter. Tell Mrs. Harnett (for I forgot to mention it to her) that 2 or three Gallons of Pickled Oysters would be the greatest rarity she could send me, I have not tasted One since I left home, also a few dryed fish of any kind, a dozen or two, if they even Stank, they would be pleasing, I am heartily tired of eating the flesh of four footed beasts, we can get very little else in this Plentiful Country that you have so often praised & indeed bragg'd off. Beleive me it is the most Inhospitable Scandalous place I ever was in. If I once more can return to my family all the Devils in Hell shall not Seperate us. The honor of being once a Member of Congress is sufficient for me, I acknowledge it is the highest honor a free State can bestow on one of its Members. I shall be careful to Ask for nothing more, but will Sit down under my own Vine & my own Fig tree (for I have them both) at Poplar Grove where none shall make me afraid except the boats of the British Cruisers. I wish you the Compliments of the Season. Remember me particularly to all my friends, I have many left yet in my old age; tho' perhaps very few in my own Town; I love them notwithstanding, as well as ever; & may perhaps (in the Course of Gods Providence) have it in power to convince them that I deserved their Confidence. I do not blame them for their neglect of me, it proceeded from that noble independent Spirit I have for so many Years been Contending for, at the risque of my own domestic care, my private fortune, and what is much more valuable My health. What I have said is not intended to be shewn to any person, It is not my wish to remind any person of matters which have been long since done away. I am with sincere regard, Dear Sir, Your real friend & Ob Servt. Cornl. Harnett  [P.S.] What is become of Capt. Allon?

  Dear Sir 28th Decr. 1777 I shall leave you to get news at large respecting our army, and the transactions of Congress, from your worthy brother, only saying as to the first, that the extremity of those injuries which were prophesied some months ago are now realized in the Commissariate; and that we also now find most of our high expectations from the expensive establishment of the Quarter-master had not a thorough foundation; Genl. W____ n has made this evident, and shown it fairly to be the clue to unravel our many seemingly misterious past miscarriages in the Field.  As to the second I will remark that few in number we have vaste business, and tho' we have had particular reason to regret your absence & that of other antient members, we must & will go thro with what times and circumstances demand to be immediately done.  From me, you will chiefly look for foreign affairs. What I have before written did not fully destroy Bingham's narrative; what I now communicate goes near to do it; but it leaves our Intelligence from St. Pierre's Miquilon in good force. Private persons at Nantes Sepr. 5th might easily be ignorant of what Bingham might know thro a public chanel at Martinique Octr. 13th. But, Mr. Williams gives me the following in a private correspondence of Octr. 18th.(1) \""The politics of this country seem still to be as from the beginning of the war. They rejoyce at every event in favor of America, because they wish to see their old enemy crushed, but that enemy is still so formidable to them that they do not seem inclined to lend an helping hand to us openly; and every peice of bad news from America, as it raises the tone of the English ambassador, increases their fears, and the effect is felt throughout all the seaports of the kingdom. We have lately had two Jamaicamen seized by the Admiralty, and I suppose they will be returned to the English. It is true prizes are still brought in & privately sold; but the purchasers, on account of the risque of having them given up, do not allow above 1/3 of the value. Thus, do the French merchants make great sums of money; and the policy of the nation goes hand in hand with the interest of individuals.  It is indeed pretended that matters will take a turn soon. The reason, they say, that war is not more thought of at present, is,(2) that their Fishermen & Baltic ships are still out: by the first they expect an additional No. of Seamen & by the last a full supply of naval stores which would be intercepted should a rupture take place now, but, that when these shall be safely arrived, they will hold a very different Language to the English. Two or three months will convince us whether these professions are sincere or not; but, I apprehend some singular success on the part of America would do more in our favor than any other Circumstance.\"" DECEMBER 28, 1777  The Rawleigh & Alfred arrived at L'orient the 6th of Octr. Between that and the 15th they had suddenly sold two Jamaicamen for only 9,700 sterlg. as the other two at Nantes taken by a Massachusetts Capt. Kendrick had been seized. One Nicholson, brother of the Baltimore Commander, had a fine Frigate just launched at Nantes, of 24 Twelves on her Gun Deck & 6 Sixes on her Quarters, and would be at sea in Novr. with the other two which were hove down at L'orient, the Commissary of which port had orders from the ministry to supply every thing out of the royal magazines for Thompson & Hindman.  Poor Johnston was taken two days after he left Morlaix by a Cutter of heavier mettal than his, having fought 5 Hours, lost many men as well as his enemy and being towed a wreck into Dover. I doubt not our Gentlemen will exert every nerve to protect him from the malice which will be ready to show itself against him after his late successes in the Irish Chanel. Our old Holland correspondent gives us on the 2d. of Augst.(3) a long detail of Sam & John Adams's wife & children at the Hague, where it seems one or other of those Gentlemen was born & married, but forsook his wife & family to make his fortune in America. \""Sr Joseph York knows this but pretends to be ignorant of it,\"" say the Relations. \""And tho',\"" says Dumas, \""this is at bottom only a bagatelle, yet I wish to have some short account of the honourable persons of Mr Sam & Mr John Adams that I may undeceive our public & confound the imposture which characterizes impudent & base enemies. They decry you in Europe as Poltrons, and they at the same time pray & intreat the European Powers not to permit you to buy arms from them; and, while they fear they shall not be able to destroy Virtue, they seek to blacken & calumniate it.\""  \""Let us pass,\"" says he, \""from this miserable tale to what is more important & more agreable.\""  The Pri[n]ce of Waldeck has two fine Regiments of his subjects in the service of this republic the contract for whom is near expiring. The Court of London, knowing this pressed that Prince to let her have them- but he answered that he had proposed a new contract to their High Mightenesses and had demanded some conditions in his own favor to be added to the former ones; that if their H. Msses. would not consent to them, he would let the King have them upon the conditions last demanded; but, that he could not refuse them to the Republic if she preferred to keep them.

  Dear Sir York Town December the 29th 1777 Your Letter of November the 26th was handed to me by the post before the last. The great Objects of the Assemblys Deliberations are of the most Interesting Nature and I have no Doubt they will bring them to Maturity with their Usual Wisdom. If the late Generous Spirit of Virginia in their Act for Cloathing and Measures for preventing of Forestalling does not Inspire the other States with a Virtuous Emulation the Avarice of Individuals will be more Fatal to the Liberties of America than the Sword of the Enemy. I have a great while past Shudder'd at the Rapid Strides of this Monster in Society, but lately he has broke through every feeble Fort Opps'd to him, and threatens us with Inevitable Destruction unless his Carrier is Immediately Check'd by the joint Efforts of the United States. In Short the Avarice and disaffection of the people here is so great that they refuse any price that we can give for the Necessary provisions for the Army, and the Generals last Letter Couch'd in terms Strong and pathetic holds out a probability of the Armys Desolveing unless they are more fully and Constantly Supplied.(1) You would Execrate this State if you were in it. The Supporters of this Government are a set of Weak men without any Weight of Character. No kind of Respect is paid by the people either to their Laws or Advice, and instead of Checking they in many Instances Countenance the Exactions of their Constituents being otherwise fearful of looseing their present Shadow of power. Two thirds of the State of Delaware are Notoriously known in their Hearts to be with our Enemys. They have not at present the Shadow of Government amongst them and their Representation to Congress has been withdrawn a Considerable time before I had a Seat in it. From this you must foresee that these Execrable States Clogg the Operations of the Continent in an Alarming Degree. Then what is to be done? Are we with this Conviction upon our Minds to suffer them for the want of Virtue and Vigour in their Governments to Involve the whole in the Worst of Calamitys or will not Congress be Justifyable (from the Necessity of the Case as Guardians to the Sacred rights of the people at large) in persueing such Measures as will Eventually save this Continent from perdition? The feelings of my own Heart tells me they will. Yet I Revere the Sovereignity of the States and the Civil rights of the people as much as any man liveing who is not Capable of more refin'd and deeper reflections than myself, such I acknowledge see things of this Dilicate Nature in a more Enlarged Comprehensive point of View and by such I Ardently wish to be Instructed. Indeed my Honored Friend for such I esteem you, the present State and Condition of this Continent, Oweing to the Alarming disaffection in this Quarter, an Almost Universal discontent in the Army, a Reformation therein Meditated by Congress to Commence and be Carry'd into Effect this DECEMBER 29, 1777  Winter with Numberless other Matters that I am not at Liberty to disclose even to you, requires the Wisdom of the first Characters amongst us to give them weight and Efficacy. Then why cant some of those who so fully come under this Description be prevail'd upon to give their attendance in Congress if it was only for a few Months? I am sure you know me two well to Impute this Earnestness to Unworthy Motives. It arises from the purest Intentions for the Interests of my Country. It would be Stupid Vanity in me not to be Sensible of my own lack of Abilitys to Constitute a Member of this August Assembly with Reputation to myself and Service to the publick, and other States in part of their Delegation equally Experience this Misfortune.  Your Supply of Cloathing came very Opportunely to Cover the Shivering Limbs of our poor Naked Soldiers. Thousands of them are now in the Hospitals for the want of even Wrags to keep them from the Cold. We hear Two Hundred thousand pounds worth of Goods (at Exorbitant prices) has been purchased in the Masachusets. We hope they will be soon forwarded to the Army.  There is no late Interesting Intelligence from either of our Army's. General Washingtons is now in Forge Valley about twenty three Miles from Philadelphia where they will probably remain Inactive the greatest part of the Winter. The Waste of the Enemy wherever they move is a Scene of Cruelty and distress. This dreadful Calamity is only Alleviated to the Whig by seeing the Torys property made one Common Ruin with his own, for all their late Ravages is Indiscriminate.  It would take a much wiser man than me to Unravel the Misterious Conduct of the French Court. They have not yet given us any publick Avowal of their patronage. Our Commissioners are never Admitted to publick or private Audiences with their Ministers. What little Business they transact with them is by the Aid of a third person and their Scanty Supplies to us seem to be Conducted with Timidity Caution and Secrecy. Some Weeks past we daily expected to hear that they had taken a dicisive part for us, but our last Letters Advise us Not to be two Sanguine in our Expectations of Foreign Assistance but to place our Security in our own Resources with this only exception that a Capital Advantage over our Enemys in the Feild may give a different Turn to the refin'd politics in Europe and Operate powerfully in our favour. This we have Obtain'd in the Surrender of Burgoyne of which the French Court are now or must Shortly be Acquainted. It is only to you that I Communicate any thing of this Nature that can have the least Tendency to Damp the Ardour or Expectations of our Countrymen.  I have wrote to a gentleman of my Acquaintance in Lancaster to endeavour to find out and procure the Workmen you desire if to be had in that Town, there being none such that will engage in this.   I have not received his Answer but have but little expectations from his Enquirys, as a Tradesmans prospects here is not a Moderate Compensation for his Labour. Nothing less than a small Fortune made without Merrit or trouble will Content him. I am told there is amongst the British prisoners in Maryland or Virginia some expert Workmen of the Trades you want. I have written to the Commissary of prisoners to Acquaint me with their Names and the Places of their confinement.(2) My design after Obtaining proper Information is to Get a permission from the Board of War for you to Employ such of them as you think proper, which I shall in due time Inclose you. This I think will be the Cheapest and probably the most Convenient way for you to Carry on your Buildings but of this you are the only proper Judge. Drums for our Militia has been an Object of my Enquirys since I first came here. They are not to be had on any Terms whatever. Our State is at present unrepresented, Mr. Jones haveing left us a few days ago.(3) Our Assembly was kind to him. I wish they would Confer the same favour on another of their Servants. Indeed my Situation is disagreable here besides you knowing my very Narrow Fortune may Immagine that sometimes the Cares of a Husband and parent tell me there is a duty oweing to them as well as to my Country. I beseech you not to Consider this Sentiment as ariseing from a littleness of Soul or a Sordid Spirit, but I could not be just to the Woman who from much higher Expectations devoted herself to me if I now altogether Neglected the Interests of her and the little pledges she has presented me with. The Complication of this Letter will Convince you of the respect I must have for the man to whom I open my whole Soul without Ceremony, Punctilio or Reserve. Jno. Harvie  ""

  Sir, York Town Decr. 29th. 1777 I wrote Council two days ago to which please to be refered. Revd. Mr. Batwell on an application to be enlarged on security on his parole, accompanied with a certificate from his Physician that fresh air and exercise were absolutely necessary to his recovery, obtained the following resolution,(1) \""That in the opinion of Congress the Revd. Mr. Batwell should be discharged out of confinement on his taking an oath of allegiance to the State of Pennsilvania; or on his refusal that he should be allowed to go with his family into the City of Philada.\"" The delicacy of interfering with this Act was agitated together with the very low condition of the pe[ti]tioner whose life was reported to be in iminent danger, & might add to the number of marters in the esteem of the disaffected who interested themselves in his behalf, nevertheless the prayer of the pe[ti]tion was not attended to, but the above alternative given, for Congress did not know how other wise to get rid of importunity and apprehended this Step from all circumstances would not be disagreeable to the State. I think the above resolve is a specimen of treatment Congress would wish to other disaffected persons in every State as was at large said DECEMBER 29, 1777  in debate, with much concern that decisive measures had not long since been taken with all Enemies to the Independence of America. A Committee are appointed to take into consideration the deplorable conditions of our army and to report tomorrow.(2) I make no doubt that the most vigorous measures will be recommended to be immediately taken, as without the army must disperse as mentioned in my last. My situation is extreamly delicate on this occasion, the ruin of our Army, or the interference with the police of the State I apprehend will be the alternative set before me, under these circumstances I should be glad of advice or assistance. The House of Burgesses in Virginia have unanimously consented to the Confideration as handed to them with orders to their Delegates to confirm it on the 10th March.  I could wish the State could favr. their Delegates with Dunlaps paper constantly. I should be glad you would furnish me with the two or three last papers. Our State I understand have published a bill which I have not seen, respecting the measures recommended to the northward, and I am told have recited the recommendation of Congress which exposes the views of Congress, this was never intended and may frustrate their designs.(3) I am respectfully, Sir, Yr. most obt. humble Servt, Daniel Roberdeau  ""

 DECEMBER 30, 1777  Although the source of many complaints since its creation in 1775, the commissary system had functioned reasonably well until Commissary General Joseph Trumbull had resigned and returned home in August 1777. His successor, William Buchanan, deprived of many of Trumbull's most capable and experienced assistants, who had resigned over Congress' refusal to base their compensation on a commission basis, struggled on with the system he had inherited, but it was clear by early autumn that sweeping changes were needed. The inherent difficulties in provisioning large numbers of troops were compounded by General Howe's capture of Philadelphia, Congress' flight to York, and the British army's competition for provisions from the region. Commissary reform and the general reorganization of army administration were delayed by Congress' slowness in installing new members of the reorganized Board of War. Expectations that the new board would play a large role in the solution of supply problems- visible in Congress' appointment of both former Quartermaster General Thomas Mifflin and Commissary General Trumbull to the new board in November- were ultimately disappointed because Trumbull's health prevented him from filling his post and Mifflin refused to respond to a call to join the congressional committee sent to Valley Forge in January to study the most pressing issues threatening army morale. Therefore, it was the old Board of War, which had been authorized on November 22 to continue the work of the War Office until the new commissioners arrived, that continued the struggle against the army's problems, acting either in its traditional capacity or as the nucleus of ad hoc committees like the Committee on Emergency Provisions. Although Gates and the new commissioners finally assumed leadership of the new board in late January 1778, clashes between Continental officials and Pennsylvania authorities further delayed new measures for effective provisioning of the army. See JCC, 9:953, 963, 10:47; Daniel Roberdeau to Thomas Wharton, February 17, note 2; and William Duer to Francis Lightfoot Lee, February 19, 1778.

Cuyler, Commissary of Northern Department in laying up plentiful magazines of Flour and Pork in such parts of the State as shall be thought best adapted for that purpose, and that you will likewise be pleased to co-operate for the same purposes with the Govenor and Council of Connecticut who are desired to superintend the Commissary Department on the East side of Hudson's River.  \""The Middle Department is exhausted of Cattle fit for the use of the Army, & the obstruction which have been met with in removing a timely and sufficient supply of Salt from the Eastern States have baffled all Prospects of laying in any large Quantities of Pork in the States of Pennsylvania & Maryland. Without  therefore the most Speedy Exertions are made use of immediately to throw in a supply of cattle to General Washington's Army and to lay up Magazines immediately the most fatal consequences cannot but ensue.  \""The vigorous Exertions made by the State of New York at a period when the affairs of America wore the most alarming aspect, afford us the most pleasing assurances that at this Crisis their Exertions in the Great Cause will not be exceeded by any State in the Union which has been wrote to on this occasion by the Committee.\"" Calendar of Historical Manuscripts relating to the War of the Revolution, in the Office of the Secretary of State, Albany, N.Y., 2 vols.

  My Dear Friend, 30th December 1777. I am now sitting both feet & Legs bound up in a Basket in the room where Congress meets-between the adjournment at 1/2 p. one oClock & meeting hour at 3-& where a scrap of somewhat will be sent for my repast to serve till tomorrow's breakfast. Perhaps two, it may be three, hours after dark I may be permitted to hobble on my Crutches over Ice & frozen Snow or to be carried to such a homely home as I have, where I must set in Bed one or two or three hours longer at the writing Table, pass the remainder of a tedious night in pain & some anxiety. I hear you reply-why faith if I was you I would resign the presidentship. Believe me my dear Sir that was my solid determination on the 2d or 3d day after my present troublesome companion had taken possession of me, when by reflective comparison with former attacks & making a proper allowance for the rigor of this Climate I foresaw a continuance of pain & Crippleism for many Weeks. I then dictated a Letter to be written to Congress expressing my apprehensions & earnestly intreating an acceptance of my resignation, an answer was returned by a Member, that Congress were not disposed to grant my request but would in preference to appointing a new President, address the Chair & Secretary during my unavoidable absence, this seemed & indeed was very kind & a little flattering-a Compliment which laid claim to my gratitude. I summoned patience & fortitude to my Aid, I adopted every measure I could think of in order to restore me to strength & abstained from every thing, except hard work, that could have the smallest tendency to impede my recovery-writing in Bed, & especially one particular Nights discipline when I kept the Pen in hand till one in the Morning & resumed it again before five, shook me. However on Christmas day I found myself so far releived from severe paine as to encourage hopes that three or four days indulgence would produce a little Strength in my Ankles, but late that Evening & again very early next Morning I received visits from a Zealous Member of Congress  DECEMBER 30, 1777  pressing me if possible by any means to attend the House the 26th adding the request was made by desire of many Members not so immediately to the President as to a Member who solely represented a State, intimating that the business which I had set or encouraged to set in motion of the highest importance was to be agitated that it ought to be treated with the greatest solemnity in a full Representation. This address to a State, made an impression which would not have been felt, if it had been directed to the president. I knew the business, it had been the subject of my meditation & contemplation through Several painful & sleepless nights & Days.(1) Beleive me my dear friend I have been obliged to pause here a minute to wipe away a falling tear which in my present low & weak state of bodily health, rose irresistibly with my reflections upon the great affair which I allude to, & to which my duty has already required me to affix my signature, a signature which will probably be brought before the Tribunal of the whole Civilized World. Possibly I may find my self at liberty to be more explicit to His Excellency the President-but to return-the Summons animated my Soul, which is more vigorous in my present condition than the Body. \""South Carolina shall not be quite unrepresented, I will be carried into Congress.\"" I was carried, two whole days trenching deep upon each Night were passed in a Committee of the whole, late last Saturday Night the business was so far matured as to enable me to dispatch a special Messenger immediately to Major General Heath at Boston.(2) These exertions have thrown me back I cannot tell how far, but I am in a condition which would meet more compassion were you present from you than it seems to do from myself. I attend Congress from the motive promised & while I can bear to be carried & to sit here, my State shall not be totally Absent. The great business is not yet completed on our part, God only knows what will be the final end of it.  I have laboured hard very hard to advance it to its present State, conscious that I am doing eminent service to my Country. If my Country Men shall be of opinion with a few in this House, who appear to me to be timorous dunces, I shall be very unhappy, but I shall ever enjoy that satisfaction which attends good designs, whether it shall be determined by the World to be good or bad, the Act is great & great good or Evil will follow as its consequences.  There are other matters of very momentous concern on the tapis which duty requires me to attend to, without regarding my own Ease & being here since 'tis the desire of Congress, I may as well sit president as any other Character. A good Seat near a warm fire must compensate for additional labour!-But there is my morsel-however before I lay down the Pen or suffer the dirty Towel to be Spread let me again recommend to you as an Assembly Man one moments reflection upon the Subject of Representation. O Carolina! O My Country, shame to you!-that in this great, this momentous Cause,  so few among your many worthy Sons are found Zealous Advocates- so very few of them will leave their yokes of Oxen, their pleasures, their emoluments & apply their Talents, their whole abilities to the one thing needful. You know I have always run the Line of true Liberty, parallel to that of the Kingdom of Heaven. Luke warm half way votaries are as unfit in these times to enjoy that, as such Characters were declared by the mouth of Wisdom to be for entring into this or in other words unfit for the great work of propagating & establishing Christian Religion, called the Kingdom of Heaven- 1770 years ago-both require a readiness to renounce all other attachments. I say-that so many can contentedly & tamely look on, & behold their Country, their posterity exposed to the hazard of Ruin, & almost without an Agent to plead for them is a lamentable reflection. Where is the boasted Virtue of 1775-where are those loud pretences which were heard on the 4th June in the same Year (3)-did that mean nothing more than Tar & Feathers? But here come Members, tis impossible to proceed, self defence bids me resign the pen & take up the Spoon.  Now my Dear Sir, tis near 9 oClock P.M. just returned from Congress I'll add a word or two, before I lay down for you must know I am in Bed. I say where are the effects of our loud pretensions to patriotism which were heard three years ago. Do those good people who are now Eating & drinking & accumulating pelf by every possible means vainly think that with the 28th June 1776 (4) all danger passed away. Truly, if we were to judge from appearances, they do think so, but alas! these are indeed vain thoughts. Gracious God interpose on our behalf & rouse my Countrymen out of their Lethargy. The most fatal error they could fall into-that of attending every Man to his private Interest-this Evil seems to pervade all Classes in So Carolina; we are lulled by a transient success into a Sleep of security which will produce our Ruin.  Were you a Witness as I am of the distresses of thousands in this State, where there are numerous Towns, Villages & Country farms to receive fugatives from the Conquered City, where also the Climate is more favorable to the human body & where there are no fears of Insurrections by Slaves, your heart would bleed as mine often does. I have neither skill nor Colour to give you a just representation. What would the Calamities of fugitives from Charles Town amount to if they were obliged to fly? Where would they fly to? You can feel an answer as I do-too shocking to rehearse.  Your neglect to keep up a proper Representation in this great Assembly the Congress, & a consideration of the Cause, the lust of Wealth & pleasure, led me in to this disgression. To the same Causes, may be ascribed your almost total neglect of almost every essential Act for your defence which is loudly complained of by one or two of my Correspondents & which I too well know to be true. If   you proceed thus blind fate you will soon fall into a Pit of perdition, you will soon be without Soldiers. Your Enemies have Spies among you who transmit exact intelligence upon the Wings of Mercury. You will be attacked in an unprepared moment, driven from your Sea ports, into those distresses which we just now said were too melancholy to repeat.  You may if you please recruit all your Regiments & fill them. Tis the Duty of the Rich to fight, but if these will, because they are Rich, be exempts, they ought to give ample encouragement to those poor fellows who skreen their persons from the dangers & hardship to which a soldiers Life is exposed.  Fill your Regiments immediately or you will be undone-fill your Delegacy in Congress with able Men-able Men I say-no frolickers -no Jolly fellows-or you will be despised & you will have cause to rue your neglect-for me plead I beseech you that I may be permitted to render my best services to my Country at home. I humbly think I have a right to demand, & therefore whatever my friends may do on my behalf, I will not condescend to beg. I will not quit my Post although I have some grounds to fear I may perish on it.(5)  ""

  Sir, York 30th December 1777 I had the honour of writing to you Yesterday, & while my packet was Iying to be called for by a Messenger who is to go early to Morrow from the Board of War your Excellency's Several favours of the 22d & 25th Inst.(1) were about 9 oClock this Evening brought to me. These shall be presented to Congress to morrow. In the mean time permit me to lament with your Excellency the deplorable Situation of our affairs in general. I have been long deeply affected from a consideration of the circumstances of our Sick & wounded Soldiers, our Officers & Soldiers in Captivity, would to God there were no other causes, melancholy as these are, for affliction in minds impressed by Sentiments of humanity & by the Love of Country. But alas Sir! your Excellency will be informed in a very few days that our whole System is tottering, & God only knows whether we shall be able to prop it up half the first Month of the approaching New Year. How affecting DECEMBER 30, 1777  indeed must this prospect be to Men, who although knowing the versatility of too many of their Country Men & foreboding the consequences, yet from a persuasion of the goodness of that great Cause in which America is now too deeply engaged to retract, have in defence of it, hazarded Estate, Life & what is nearer, the future happiness of Children. To trouble your Excellency with a detail of Alarms which I judged necessary to sound soon after I had the misfortune of arriving at the State House Philadelphia in July last, would savor of a vanity which I am sure has no place in my mind, but I had the mortification to find, I spoke to Walls, or gave offence to Individuals. I had no other consolation but that which arises from complaining & predicting to our constituents & particular friends- mine will soon have occasion to revert to my Letters of September. Excuse me Sir I intreat you, if from Sympathizing with your Excellency I have unwarily been led to say too much, but my heart is full, my Eyes overflow, when I reflect upon a camp 1/4th & more of Invalids for want of necessary covering-an Army on the very verge of bankruptcy, for want of food-that we are Starving in the midst of plenty-perishing by Cold, & surrounded by Clothing Sufficient for two Armies, but uncollected. Had proper diligence been used to draw Clothing from the Eastward & Soward those who are now naked & perishing in General Washington's Camp might all have been covered early in November. Thank God there is some hopes now of having this necessary work performed in a few Weeks. The loss of Men, from the deficiency in that branch, I fear has been & will be very heavy.  In an Act of Resolutions which I lately transmitted to General Washington, Congress very earnestly recommended the protection of New Jersey to His Excellency & the General has replied with that propriety & sensibility which is discernable in all his actions & expressions.  Your Excellency could not have adopted a more proper term for describing the late & present employments of the Board of War, & equally applicable to Congress in general. Their business has undoubtedly been & is very important & truly multifarious. They have not only the great outlines of public business to Mark but for some time past have been obliged to descend even to the executive parts of the Duties of Clothier General, Quarter Master General, Commissary General &c &c &c. Otherwise we should not now be tottering, we should be flat down. I will say nothing of what might have been saved or done had time been seized by the forelock.  I am with very great Regard  [P.S.] As this will go by a Messenger from the Board of War I think it will be best to detain him who came from Your Excellency three or four days, within that time other business may be matured.

  Dear Sir 30th Decr. [1777] Mr. Geary otherways engaged has given me the pleasure of forwarding this Intelligence from your friend Jefferson respecting the ready concurrence of the Dominion with the Articles sent lately to the States in a hope of cementing them together in a firm League.(1)  I am particularly rejoyced at this dispatch at this critical time when things appear almost despoiled in this neighbourhood. As a secret I tell you that there is the greatest risque that the army will be disbanded in a short season, for the Commissary's & Qr Master's departments are ruined. I hope Robt. Morris will take up the first himself immediately or as a Director; Buchannan is as incapable as a child and knows not how he can feed the army 3 Weeks from any parts, or how to feed them from day to day with what he has on hand. Mutiny is at present suppressed. The Clothier is little better & the Director Genl. of Hospitals is at his wits end. Trumbull would be deified if he was on the spot, send him from Boston if there.  The Board of War with military drivers are Quarter masters owing to the Imbecility of the Govt. of this State which must be changed after the present glaring conviction of its Impotence.

  Sir, War Office Decr. 31st 1777 Congress have received the most alarming Accounts from General Washington of the Distress of the Army for Want of Provisions. He expresses the strongest Apprehensions that unless an immediate DECEMBER 31, 1777  Supply is sent the Troops must either \""starve, dissolve or disperse.\"" This Disaster is likely to befall us by much Distraction having prevailed in the Commissary's Department to the Eastward which has prevented a Supply of Salt expected from thence from getting forward in Time. The laying up Provisions has been hereby prevented & few or no Supplies of Cattle have been drawn from that Quarter. The Avarice of the People too has had no small Share in reducing us to our present Distress. A Comittee is appointed by Congress to take effectual Means for preventing so fatal a Blow as the Dispersion or Dissolution of our Army would be to our Liberties. They have been obliged from the Necessity of the Case to give Orders for siezing all the Provisions in the Vicinity of the Camp in this State which will afford a small but temporary Supply. They have written to the adjacent States & earnestly besought their immediate Assistance. Much Dependance is placed on your Exertions at this important Crisis & the Comittee need but state the Facts to induce you immediately to take Measures for the remedying the Evil. I beg Leave to suggest to you whether an immediate Seisure of all Cattle, Hogs, Pork & Salt in the State of Maryland is not indispensibly necessary & Certificates given payable by Congress to the Possessors.(1) You are the best Judge of proper Measures to be taken within your State & therefore the Comittee will not trouble you with their Ideas of the Plan to be executed for procuring the Articles wanted. They are confident you will be as speedy as the Nature of the Case will admitt convinced that immediate Supplies can only be had from the nearest States & the Comittee have taken Steps for obtaining Relief in future from those more remote. The issuing Commissary at Camp will receive any Cattle &c you may please to forward & the Commissary General of Purchases will take into his Charge on being informed thereof, all Magazines of Pork & Salt you may think proper to have laid up. All Drafts or Certificates (Duplicates whereof you will no Doubt be of Opinion should be lodged with you as Vouchers) given or drawn by your order will be duly honoured by the Treasury Board. I would beg Leave to suggest to you the great Difficulty & Danger in the Transportation of Provisions up the Bay in the common Mode & entreat the Use of the State armed Vessells for the Purpose as a similar Request is made to the Governor of Virginia.(2) It is impracticable to procure Provisions from the Southward without the Use of these Vessells. The Comittee rely strongly on the Exertions of Maryland & Virginia in laying up Magazines for future Supply as well as obtaining present Relief. They have the most flattering Ideas of receiving that Assistance from these of which they have been unhappily dissappointed from other States, & must depend on them for their principal Supply.

  Sir, Decr. 31st. 1777. A Course of Disappointments has attended the Printing of the Journals of Congress. Good Progress was indeed making in Sepr. last when Mr. Aitkin had nearly finished a second Volume with December 1776. This Work has been sent out of the city of Philadelphia, and buried.  By all the Scrutiny I can make, I gain no other Knowledge about the Spot where the Books are deposited than a high Probability that Frederic Bicking a Paper-maker has the Care of them.(1)  Having tarried myself in Philada. after the other Delegates left it, I procured of Col. Hamilton a Security of some Waggons from Impressment for the use of Mr. Aitkin which he did not appear to me afterwards to have been spirited to make use of; and in Fact he remained in the City.  Bicking is an honest timorous Man and lives in the Neighbourhood of John Roberts a Miller 10 Miles from Philada. which Roberts is a Tory,(2) and yet tis probable his Team brought the Journals out for Mr. Aitkin.  I beg your Excellency to communicate these Circumstances to some active Pennsylvanian Officer, who, being acquainted with the Spot of Ground mentioned, will take a proper speedy Method of gaining the Journals & forwarding them to Lancaster or York. I imagine the Types are also buried at the same Place with the Journals. They would be a valuable Acquisition at this Time, tho' they are not absolutely necessary to carry on the Journals.  I am not insensible to the great Affairs which press your Excellency on every side; but, I really thought this Business of recovering the Journals was important enough to warrant the Freedom I now take of applying to you for Orders respecting the Pursuit of it. I had intended to do it in Person, but the Absence of three of my Colleagues and other Gentlemen has thrown such additional Committee-Business DECEMBER 31, 1777  upon me as to make it impossible to assure you, otherways than by a Letter, that I am, Your Excellency's Obliged Friend & Humble Servant, James Lovell  ""

  Dear Sir Janry. 13th. 1777 [i.e. 1778] I prevented Congress some time ago from inserting Massachusetts among those states to whom pressing recommendation has been sent to afford more members to transact the business for which is great & various here at this period; but I find reason to repent my interposition, tho', otherwise, you would have been summoned back immediately upon getting out of your Saddle in Boston.  When 5 were actually at York, 2 Delegates were a Representation; JANUARY 13, 1778  now only 3 are here, 3 are essential in Congress. This, at the worst season of the year, to 3 shabby constitutions is irksome; more especially as each is on 2 standing committees, and according to the usual fate of eastern members are seldom forgot upon perplexing transient calls. Mr. Dana goes to Camp, with three others of Congress and 3 (1) of the new Board of War, upon the great Business of introducing Discipline & Economy into the army. Poor Geary will get a double portion of Treasury-toil by this, which upon the back of a great deal of System-Patching lately, will go near to put him past the salutary power of Vegetables.  But, I must say more about the same Delegation. It is expected that 5 shall attend together the Duties of the Appointment. When shall I snatch a few dear domestic Joys? Not till the four now absent shall chuse to quit their genial BOARDS. I say the 4, because the BACHELOR has a right to return & enjoy his BED near Salem, before I prove I can pick a Bone at my own TABLE in Boston.  We have wanted 2 of our Colleagues lately as Mentors;(2) tho' we should not, even with them, have been quite unanimous. Just cause, ground or reason to fear that a contract made will be violated warrants a suspension of the agreement, till that fear is done away; but, that just cause must be something consequent to the Convention; and the degree of fear arising from the same word or deed will operate variously according the characters of persons & circumstances of things. It is not to be wondered at, therefore, if a great variety of Judgements should be formed in the world upon the late decision of Congress. Those who have been chiefly theoretic students will shake their heads and cry nay. These will be joined by some timorous christians who are always doubting even when they say they have sure hope. On the other hand practical Politicians joined by all such good Folk as, supposing themselves past the days of miraculous Exhibition, look upon natural vigorous exertions as somewhat connected with the essence of Hope, these, I suppose, will cry aloud aye. G_____ & I are in the latter Classes. Brother D_____ (3) tho not fully with us was honestly & judgematically differing, as far as he did differ. I suspect the two Mentors if here would not have been quite in Unison.  But there has been another particular Case in which I think I should have had you both on my part, tho I have stood single against two worthy patriotic Brethren.  You must have observed in some of my past Scrawls that there was an appearance of a wish or design to put our military officers upon the footing of European. \""To put them on Half pay after the end of this War either for Life or 20 or 10 or 5 years, to secure Pensions to their Widows, and to make their commissions vendible.\"" In my rage against Extortioners I have thrown out these things in the Course of my Correspondence but not so much to frighten them into   an amendment of manners, as to draw reproof to myself from old veterans, as Clark calls one of my Friends, and from any others who have not forgotten that this was in its beginning a patriotic war.  Are we not in a young country where a living is easily gotten by labour and where it is not a disgrace to work? so that Officers after the War may with ease and without shame maintain themselves upon land which is to be given to them as well as to soldiers.  Are not our soldiers, many of them, married Men as well as their Commanders? In Europe they are single, or if married, they have wives like themselves without any home. Let this equallity in America be considered, and say whether the soldier's Widow shall not have a Pension, and the soldier surviving the War be put on Half pay.  Are not Militia Officers almost as much in the Field as our Continental Gentlemen? Must we not enlarge the half pay Scheme or disgust the Militia? a Case of the Kind not happening in Europe. There, this mode of introducing into Society a set of haughty, idle, imperious Scandalizers of Industrious Citizens & Farmers may be practiced. I have no reason to look for a Half pay majority in Congress; As there is really no argument for it but a fear of all our best officers leaving the army. Here my spirit catches fire; but, the consequence shall not be the filling of a whole sheet of paper with Remarks & Anathemas. I will not foreclose my expectations from you.  I must go back to my first Subject as an apology for not writing the history of York Town at large.  Folsom, Dana, Reed, Harvey go to Camp. Pen to the Hospitals. Therefore the 13 States have their Business managed by a snug set indeed.  N. Hampshire 1 Massachusetts 2 no vote Rh.

  Sir, Camp 26th Jany 1777 [i.e. 1778] I have taken Occasion to speak to the Marquis de la Fayette upon the Appointment you know of. The Sentiments of his Heart which are fully expressed in a Letter to you do him so much Honor that any Expressions of mine would be impertinent.(1) I am deeply surprized at the mature Judgment & solid Understanding of this Young Man for such he certainly is.(2) The Impropriety of having the first and second in Command from a foreign Country is strongly stated by him and his Apprehensions that it would be disagreable to the Subjects of America are certainly not ill founded for great Liberality in vulgar Minds is not common even in America. It deserves the Consideration of Congress whether in Case an Accident should happen to the Commander in Chief it would be prudent to trust a Person whose object it is to push his Fortunes in France with an Opportunity to imbue the Minds of the Canadians with a Love of the Grand Monarque who may as probably like Canada as any of his Predecessors. This Consideration has not the less Weight from being mentioned by the Marquis. His having pitched upon McDougall who you may remember I wished to have with him may have prepossessed me in Favor of what some Gentlemen may call his Prejudices and this Prepossession is as you may well suppose not weakened by his Declaration that he would willingly act under him as second in Command if deemed necessary for the Service. I write standing in the midst of Company. You will therefore be so kind as to excuse the Stile of this Letter which upon Perusal I find to be very defective.  I have the Honor to be, with very great Respect, Sir, Your most obedient & very humble Servant, Gouvr Morris  ""

  Dear Sir York in Pensylvania Octr. 22d. 1777 The Account of Genl. Gates's glorious Success is not yet confirmed from himself & yet the Authority is too good to admit of any doubts. Govr. Geo. Clinton had the Account from the Committee of Albany & gave it [to Genl Putnam] (1) who handed to Genl Was[hington] & he to Congress in Substance thus. That a Capitulation was signed the 14 Inst. by Genl Burgoyne by which he & his whole army Surrendered themselves Prisoners of War, they marched with the Honors of War to a Certain Spot where they grounded their Arms & from thence were sent Prisoners to Massachusetts. No other particulars are given in these letters; but private letters & reports tell us of 40 Brass Field pieces, 10,000 Stand of arms, Cloathing, Stores &c but for all this we wait most impatiently for Genl Gates's dispatches & surely they will come soon.  We are told also that Genl Gates was coming down against Fort Montgomery which had lately, been taken by Genl. Sir Henry Clinton with the Troops he had in the City of N.York on Long & Staten Island together with a reinforcement lately recd from England. I think there is no doubt but Gates will soon regain Fort Montgomery as his Army is Numerous, Strong & flushed with Vict[ory . . .] it is Said, has 5000 Men [. . .] he is approaching New York as we are told here, it is also Said that 7000 Men are actually going against Rhode Island from whence they will certainly dislodge the Enemy.  We also have it here that Genl Howe is flying onboard his Ships having quitted his Camp at Germantown & our Army have taken possession of it.  I think Genl Howe is obliged to come on this side Schuylkill to open the Land Communication with the Fleet at Chester & to open his way to a supply of provisions from the Country as our little Navy on the Delaware maintain their post & Genl Potter had [stopped] the intercourse between the City & Country. Genl Washington I suppose will follow & we may Soon expect another Action. It appears to me that Genl Howe is now in a bad way, for if the News from the Northward be all true We may sweep New York & in the End serve him as Gates Served Burgoyne. But [. . .] all good News. As to Elections I can tell you little about them, at this place I am told there was only fifteen  APPENDIX  Voters, at Lancaster G. Ross says there was only 11. Be this as it may the New Assembly will meet and go on with business and really I think it is dangerous to the State to give opposition whilst it is Invaded.

You do me a Species of Injustice by it because you suppose me guilty of Negligences which do not justly lie at my Door.(1) My Heart does not yet charge me with the Guilt of being insensible to the Claims of Friendship. Let us put things on a proper Footing. Take you no note of my Sins of Omission and you shall charge me justly with none of Commission. You ask why I am here. I answer that I am sent to regulate our Army. One Word therefore upon the Subject you write on. The Ardency of our Friend's Desire to acquire Honor does him so much Honor that perhaps it would be unfair to let him have more.(2) Seriously. You know me I hope so well as to believe what is most true that Nothing in my Power shall be wanting that will conduce to his Welfare or that of any other Person you may patronize even if unconnected with you. Perseverance, Perseverance that is the great Desideratum. I will promise Nothing but this I tell you, that I hope much More of this hereafter when things are in better train.  Nothing could have been more agreable to me than to have continued in the Circle of my Friends in our own State But what can be done. I was ordered away and to have staid would have been reprobated by some Persons in our Legislature. I would that I were quit of my congressional capacity which is in every Respect irksome. Stuffed in a Corner of America & brooding over their Situation they have become utter Disagreables. There are no fine Women at York Town. Judge then of my Situation. Worse still I am now in Camp and Lady Kitty & Miss Brown within three Miles of me for several Days past. I cannot go to see them. Politics I can say nothing about for we really FEBRUARY 5, 1778  have nothing worth saying. As to news all we have is comprizd in a few inconsequential Anecdotes. The most marked is the Desertion of a young British officer whose Name I do not recollect. Pray remember me to your Lady, Mother & Sisters. I shall write you a long Letter as soon as I have time to think. Oh, I had like to have forgotten that I wished to tell you that Interest should be made with the Legislative of our State to send their Chancellor to the Meeting of those who are to regulate Prices.(3) A measure Which we both know to be ruinous.

  My dear sir, Reading Feby. 14th. 1777 [i.e. 1778] You will be much surprised to hear of me from Reading, where I have been detain'd three or four Days in Expectation of receiving a Letter from York Town, the Substance of which is (I am told) a very Extraordinary Conversation betwixt the Marquis de la Fayette, and Genl. Conway, of which I had the Honor of being the Topic.(1) In the FEBRUARY 14, 1778  Course of a Discussion betwixt these Officers of the Expedition against Canada,(2) the Marquis Exprest his Astonishment, that I should be trusted to go on it, as he had been inform'd that my political Character was that of a Tory.(3) Risum teneatis, Amici,? if you can, your risible Muscles are not so flexible, as I take them to be. I think it is no difficult Matter to guess at the Quarter, whence this Insinuation comes, or the Purpose for which it is design'd. I am happy, however, to learn it in Time, for however I despise the Insinuation it will furnish me with this Useful Lesson not to risque my own Reputation, and Ease of Mind by troubling the Young Telemachus with the Presence of a Person, whom he cannot consider as a Mentor. Before I was informd of this Matter my Imagination suggested to me that the Pleasure, which the Marquis Exprest of my going with him as a Volunteer appeard more the Result of French Politisse than of Inclination; yet, as I was of Opinion my Presence might be useful to the Public, I was willing to sacrifice my own feelings to a more important Consideration. To persist in this Resolution at present would be a Breach of Self Duty, as I must in such Case sacrifice my own Ease, and (possibly) my Reputation, without the Hope of possessing with the Marquis that Influence, which might be necessary for Effecting Purposes beneficial to the public Weal. I have thought it my Duty to communicate this Matter to you in order that you may mention it to the Board of War (4) and to Congress, who probably depend on my going into Canada, and may thereby be prevented from taking such Measures with respect to that Expedition, as Policy may suggest. I think a Committee of Congress ought without Delay to be sent into Canada should our Troops oblige the Enemy to retire to Quebec; and though I owe too much to my own Feelings to Volunteer it, where I am lookd upon in a Suspicious Point of View, I will if Congress think proper, act as one of such a Committee, provided Mr. Law of Connecticut whose Probity and good Sense must be well known in Congress be appointed to act with me. Should Congress think proper to take any Measures on this Subject, they will be pleasd to communicate it to me as early as possible, directing their Letter to the Care of Genl. Schuyler. I shall now proceed from myself to the Public.  In my last Letter (5) I inform'd you that I should endeavor to prevail on Genl. Mifflin to join the Board of War without delay. I accordingly explain'd to him the Manner in which the Resolution respecting his Settlement of the public Accts. had past,(6) and gave my Opinion, that it ought not to be consider'd in the rigorous Sense which at first View it appears to Convey. All my Endeavors, I am sorry to say, have proved fruitless, his Feelings appear to me greatly wounded, and what has tended to aggravate them is the Return of Mr. Butler from York Town without a Farthing of Cash; although the Department is in a most Miserable Condition for Want of that Article. I   have taken much Pain to make myself acquainted with the State of the Department, and am fully convinced, that unless active and Experienc'd Officers are immediately appointed to conduct the different Branches of it, and be properly Supplied with Cash, in order to enter into the immediate Execution of the Business, that We shall not be able to take the Feild 'till very late next Year, for Want of Waggons, Camp-Equipage &ca. Nay, I doubt whether this will be the Worse. The Supply of the Army depending upon an Active and judicious Discharge of this Office, a Defect in this Point, added to other Causes, will I fear occasion the Dissolution of the Fragments of a once Powerful Army.  Your Zeal, my dear sir, for the Cause we are engaged in, will I trust engage you to rouse Congress from their Languour, and not to cease urging them on this Point, 'till Matters are put in a proper Train. So much Time has elapsed without any thing being done with respect to this Matter, that I doubt whether the Exertions of any Person whom Congress can at present appoint will atone for what has past. But should they appoint Persons of Ordinary Talents, or even Persons of Ability, but living at a Distance (whence great Delays must necessarily accrue in their Entering into the Execution of their Office) the most fatal Consequences must Ensue. Some of the Principal Misfortunes in the Commissary's Department were derived last year from this Source. Considering the present critical Situation of Affairs the Persons to conduct this Business ought in my Opinion to be Appointed either out of the Army, or amongst Persons in this State and that of Jersey, who have had some Experience in the Department. There are two Persons in Pena. who in my Opinion are well calculated to conduct two of the Branches respecting the furnishing Waggons and Forage. I mean Mr. Mark Bird and Colo. R.L. Hooper. The former is a Man of great Influence, and Property, and brought up from his Youth in a Business, which from its Nature, is capable of furnishing good Quartermasters, namely the Iron Factory; the second, you know from the Accounts and repeated Testimonies we have received is undoubtedly a Man of Business. To this it may be added that they have already been Employ'd in that Business, which must necessarily give them an Advantage over Persons, whatever their Talent may be, who have not yet applied them in this Channel.  From Principles of public Duty, I am induced to mention these Persons; but I must observe that in my Opinion nothing can Effect a radical Cure to the Mischiefs which prevail in that System, and introduce Vigor, and OEconomy, not only in that, but in the other military Departments, but the ordering Genl. Schuyler to the Army, and prevailing on him to accept of the Qu. Ma. Department; and in Conjunction with the Comrs. of the War Office to model it, as they shall deem Expedient. I trust you know me too well to think I have so  often urged this from any Considerations of personal Friendship. Were I to consult his Peace of Mind, I should be against his Accepting it; because I know the Opposition he would meet with from many who make their Harvest, by destroying all Order in the Administration of public Affairs. My Mind is imprest with the Strongest Conviction of the Necessity of calling forth his Talents for the public Service; and Congress will I am afraid be obliged to acknowledge it when it may be too late to remedy the Evils which accrue from the Cruel and unjust State of Suspense he is at present kept in.(7) Shall I beg your Attention whilst I enter into some Minutiae with Respect to this Department, which have come to my Knowledge. 1st. There is not at present at Camp Sufficient Strength of Teams and Horses to move the Artillery and Baggage of the Army, should the Movements of the Enemy render a Retreat necessary.  2. Were more Horses and Teams supplied at this Time for Want of a proper Supply of Forage, a judicious Mode of Feeding, and a proper Discipline in the Arrangement and Care of the Teams, they would before the month of April is past be in as miserable a Condition as they are at present.  3d. Upwards of two thousand horses have been Expended in the course of the last Campaign in the Q.M. Department; and from what I can learn few (if any) of the Harness belonging to these Horses have been preserved.  4. Through Want of proper Management and Care of the Tents, few if any of them can be made Serviceable for the next Campaign.  5. No Magazines of Forage from what I can learn is as yet laid up for the Spring Service.  This is a faint Sketch of the State of this Department. I leave it to yourself to draw the Inferences. I shall only observe that it is lamentable to consider that we, whose Resources in this and the Comys. Department are in many Respects much preferable to those of the Enemy, should be in danger of having our Army disbanded from a Want of these Branches being conducted with Spirit and Skill, at a Time when the Enemy are making every Preparation for opening the Campaign early, and profiting by our Want of Attention, and the Exercise of a false humanity (it deserves the Name of Treason!) which induces us to leave in their Power as much Forage, and as many horses, as are necessary for enabling them to act with Vigor in carrying on this wicked, and Cruel War.  Another Object, which demands your immediate Attention and in which a Delay must be fatal, is the Supplying the Comrs.(8) with Cash for forming the Magazines. I have conferred with Colo. Hooper, and the other Gentn. in this Quarter on the Subject, and am convinced, that if they are immediately supplied, nothwithstanding the   Time which has been lost they will answer the Expectation of Congress; if not, all Prospect of forming Magazines in Time on this Side the Susquehanna must be given up. I trust therefore that they will be Supplied immediately with Money. I believe the Treasury Board are alarmed at the large Sums daily demanded for the public Service, but, when they consider that almost all the Articles in the Comys., Quarter Masters, and Cloathing Department, exceed on an Average four Times the Price at which they were purchased not twelve months Since, and that this is Season, in all Wars, where the largest Expenditures are necessary, their Wonder on this Point must cease. However painful the Reflection, more Money (and that a very large Sum must be immediately emitted) but this is like giving Water to a dropsical Man: a ruinous Expedient. It will give Ease for a short Time-but unless our Finances are better managed, than they have been, (or indeed ever can be by a Committee of Congress) the Sinews of War must fail and Congress lose Entirely the Opinion the public once formed of their Wisdom. Less than a Year must, I am confident, exhaust our narrow System of temporary Expedients, and Contracted Measures. The State of the public Debt, and the critical Situation of Affairs call loudly for the Care of Men of Superior Abilities, of Capacity, to form some great comprehensive Plans for our Relief- Men, who will not be biassed by a Consideration to particular States, much less Individuals; or content themselves with a languid Official Execution of their Duty; but apply to the important Business of our Finances with a Steadiness arising from a Conviction of their own Talents, and Integrity, and with the Zeal of Men, who are passionate for their Purpose. Such Men it is the Duty of Congress in my Opinion to find out as quick as possible, to entrust the Super Intendence of the Treasury to them, and to Support them in the Execution of their Office, and in the Plans they may Suggest for introducing public CEconomy, and supplying our Funds. I know it has been a Doctrine pretty generally received as Orthodox in Congress that the Treasury should only be entrusted to the Management of the Members of Congress, and my Colleague Mr. Duane (who to do him justice attended faithfully to it, and managed it with Reputation) is a Sanguine Partizan for this Opinion; yet, whoever considers how few Members of Congress could ever pretend to the Character of Financiers, the Evils, which flow from a constant Fluctuation of Members of the Treasury, and the Partiality in public Advances too often shewn to particular States, and individuals, from a political Complaisance which the Members are inclined to shew to each other, and the Impossibility there is of Members of Congress giving up Sufficient Time to the Board, to make themselves Masters of the Business, and to enable them to conduct it with Advantage to the Public, and with Satisfaction to Individuals, whoever, I say, considers these Points,   must be of Opinion that the Evils arising from the present mode of Conducting the Treasury infinitely overballance any Advantage, which can result from its being under the Management of Members of Congress.(9) The only Advantage, which I ever heard mention'd as attending the present Mode, was its being a powerful check against Frauds, and improper Application for public Money. But, Surely, there is no magical Influence in the Name of a Committee of Congress, which can of itself produce these valuable Ends. These must be effected by Strict Integrity, Knowledge of Business, and close Attention in the Committee who Super Intend the Treasury-and the same Qualities may be found in Commissioners to be appointed by Congress for this Purpose, at least in equal, and so far as it respects Attention, and Skill, in a Superior Degree. I wish therefore that the Treasury Department, as well as every other Executive Department of Congress was thrown under Commissioners. Every possible Precaution ought certainly to be taken that these Persons should not only be well qualified by their abilities, but, by an unsuspected Integrity of Character, for the Exercise of a Trust, of such high Moment-but if no one was to be appointed to it, but after being a certain Space of Time in Nomination, and by the Voice of nine States, the public would have every Security for a faithful Discharge of this trust which could be expected. An additional one (if deem'd necessary) might still be added; and that is a Committee of Congress to be appointed by the Ballot of nine States, whose Business it should be to inspect monthly the Proceedings of the Commrs. and to report to Congress their Opinion of the Mode in which the Treasury Business has been conducted. Should you agree with me in this Opinion (which I trust you will in a great Measure) you will ask perhaps where are the Men to be procur'd who are fit for this Business, and who are willing to execute it. I must confess that I do not think there are many Men in America, who can be considered as Financiers, our contracted dependant System of Government not affording Scope for Abilities of this Species. Yet some undoubtedly might be found whose Genius fits them in a peculiar Manner for such a Line of Business. Two occur to me at present Mr. R. Morris of this State, and my Colleague Govr. Morris. With respect to the former, you know him so well, that it is unnecessary to enlarge upon his Character-the latter, tho' Young, has turned his thoughts and Course of Reading much to the Subject of Money as a Science, and from his Genius would I am convinced make an Useful, and Shining Member in such a Department. Some others in the different States might be fix'd on, with whom I am not acquainted. Whether or no if Congress thought proper to make such an Establishment these Persons would accept, I cannot tell; but this I am certain of-that they ought to do it, as the Situation of public Affairs calls for the Talents of every Person in that Line, where he   can be most Useful to his Country. My Mind is so strongly oppressed with these and Several other Matters relating to our public Matters that I cannot find ease till I unbosom myself, and I know no one to whom I can do it with greater Frankness than yourself. A long Experience of you in the Course of last Year had convinced me of your Abilities to judge, and of your Determination to persue what is Right. I am interrupted from proceeding further by a Messenger who brings an account from the Army, which I have Daily expected. I have obtained a Copy of the Letter concerning the Situation of our Army, which I transmit to you.10 If Congress has not received the Acct. make such Use of it as your Prudence may Suggest. For my own Part, when I consider the Character of our present Councils, and that of the principal Leaders in our Army, I am induced to prepare My Mind for an Event (which unless a Miracle interposes) will certainly happen, the Dissolution of the Army. Whether or no this may prove Eventually for the Worse, I am at a Loss to determine. Some great public Calamity may call forth the Spirit of Enquiry into the Causes of our misfortunes, rouse all our public Bodies from their Languour, compell the Prejudices of States and Individuals to bend to the public Good, and call forth those Spirited and determined Whigs both in our Councils, and in our Armies, by whose means only this Revolution dike all others which have ever happend) will be brought to an Issue .  You may perhaps think me too Sanguine in harbouring such an Idea, but when you Consider the Justice of this War, and take a retrospective View of the Extraordinary Events which have happen'd in it, and the Instruments with which we have labour'd you will be induced to cry out as a good Catholic, Non nobis Domine.  Dr. Potts is kind enough to take charge of this Letter, I flatter myself from the necessary Changes which will be made in our Medical System, and from the Harmony which (I trust) will subsist betwixt himself and Dr. Shippen the most beneficial Consequences will be derived in the Management of our Hospitals.(11)  I beg you to tender my Respects to Mrs. Lee, and to remember me to the Members of the Board, particularly our Fellow Labourer in the Vinyard Dick Peters. Tell him I meditate writing him in Folio the next Attack I have of the Cacoethes Scrib.  You will oblige me in making my Compliments to Mr. Arnet (12) and Mr. Penn, and Mr. Langworthy, and Mr. Wood, my old Mess mates.  As I have some Matters which I propose communicating to you from this Place I shall stay here till I have finished another Letter to you. Since I have been out of the Vortex of Confusion in York Town Two Matters have suggested themselves to me, the one an Expeditious, and Cheap Mode, of procuring a Body of Horse for the next  Campaign, the other, in my Opinion as certain Mode of recovering the Navigation of the Delaware, and thereby obliging the Enemy either to Surrender, or to hazard a Retreat through the Jerseys with the Loss of their Shipping. Twenty five thousand Men with good Generals to conduct the different Divisions of the Army, will I think be Sufficient.  However you and the Board of War will judge of both when I communicate the matter fully.  God bless you, and Yours! Wm. Duer  P.S. I have particular Reasons for wishing that Congress was immediately furn[ishe]d with an Exact Muster of the Conl. Army, particularly the Main Army. It is high Time we should know the Worst of Matters and prepare against it as Wise, as Brave men ought.  ""

  Dear Ma'am York Town, 21st. of March 1777 [i.e. 1778] I am to thank you, in my own name, and on the public account, for that exercise of laudable patriotic prudence, which you have modestly termed the \""Freedom\"" of inclosing to me Mr. McCreary's letter to your worthy Husband. I read it in Congress, and I think it will be useful to the commercial Committee.(1) The same Gentleman wrote to Mr. Adams in Sepr. some interesting history,(2) of which he gave me a copy, just before he undertook his late vast Sacrifice to his Country's Wellfare. I fear I shall have wounded you by carrying your mind back to a day which you ought to strive to forget, by confining your imagination strictly to that of your future reunion: but, your billet under my eye, by developing your character, made my pen mark the expression \""vast Sacrifice,\"" while my heart acknowledged its individual portion of the debt of gratitude, which our Mr. Adams may charge against the Public.  All the intelligence which we received from France, about the period of Mr. McCreary's letter, was of the same tenor; our friends in MARCH 21, 1778  Martinique wrote in like style on Decr. 3d; but, on the 28th of that month and the 26th of January we have an ecclaircisement of the gallic finesse.(3) The most open protection is afforded to our trade, privateers are fitted out, and their prizes not only sold, but a duty of 1 pr. Ct regularly paid upon their cargoes towards the governmental revenue. The Governor of Antigua has no resource left but impotent threats to the General at St. Pierres of the Resentment that may arise in the breast of his Britannic Majesty, when the affair is properly represented. I suspect that England will more easily draw France in to open War by talking about Reconciliation than by boasting of subduing us by force. Louis thinks the latter impossible: his only fears are about the former.  I cannot give you any thing agreable from this neighbourhood. I cannot promise you that we shall owe our prosperity to our own spirit and preperations, in any degree comparable to what we shall owe to the Enemy's embarrassments and the unmerited favour of Providence, but, our hope of the latter is hardly supported in a ballance by the Justice of our Cause, counteracted by the selfish spirit of the Times: Justly may I be turned to the Parable of the Beam and Mote while I beg You to count me among yr. affectionate humb Servant[s].
