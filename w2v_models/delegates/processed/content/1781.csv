  Dear Sir Philada. [October 10, 1781] (1) I received yesterday yours of the 2d inst.(2) Some of the questions mentioned in it I anticipated in my last. The clause of the resolutions you left on the table relating to Indian purchases is still undetermined.(3) Many attempts have been made to bring the Vermont dispute to an issue, but the diversity of opinions that prevail on one side & the dilatory artifices employed on the other have frustrated them. All the evidence has been heard and a proposition for including it within the jursidiction of some one of the States debated for some time, but the decision was suspended. An arrangement of the Army founded on G. Washington's letter, has passed Congress and is now with the Genl. for his observations on it. It includes a recommendation to the States to fill up their quotas. No arrangement of the Civil departments has taken place. A new medical system has been passed. Shippen is again at the head of it. Craig & Cockran have not been forgotten. The instructions relating to the Mississippi have passed entirely to my satisfaction. A committee is now preparing a state of the reasons & principles on which they stand. Dr Lee has not yet arrived.(4)  No military or naval intelligence has come to hand since my last except a further report that a very large embarkation is actually going on at N. York. It will be prudent for Virginia not to neglect the precautions necessary for her defence in case she should be the object of it.  Andre was hung the 2d inst. He submitted to his fate in a manner that shewed him to be worthy of a better one. His coadjutor Smith will soon follow him. The Hero of the plot, it is said is to be made a Brigadier and employed in some predatory expedition suited to his genius & his thirst for pelf. It is said with more probability that  OCTOBER 10, 1780  his baseness is heartily despised by those who have taken advantage of it, and that some resentment is mixed with their contempt on account of the loss of their darling officer.  Our domestic controversy is still sub judice. This day I believe will certainly decide it in its present stage. If it should be unfortunate it will be carried into the Court of Errors. Some propositions founded on an amicable separation have been made on the part of Bulkley but they were so pregnant with ruin to the old lady that her friends could not advise her to accede to them.(5)  Your compliments were presented to the family as you desired, and are returned with very great sincerity. I hope your lady and son have by this time recovered, and that no other impediment will keep you from the Assembly when it meets, or from returning hither as soon as it rises.  I am Dr. Sir yr Affecte friend & Servt,  James Madison Junr.  ""

Monsr. L_____ has promised to use his endeavors to have our request complied with. (2) We have the Honor of transmiting to Yr.

  Sir (1) Philadelphia January 1st 1781.  This day I received your Letter of the seventeenth Ult with Mr. Hortons enclosed; I shall in the morning take care to send it either to Mr. Bradford or to Mr. Horton, if I can find where he lives.  You say you have not seen any of the great Folks, but understand they figure, & feel their helm. If all I hear is true it appears to me some of their figuring is neither for their profit or honor. I sincerely wish the morals of the people may not be corrupted by their figurings. It is unaccountable to me that some Gent. and Ladies have attended upon some of the figurings. A few years ago they would have thought it extreamly wrong to have countenanced any such measure, but alas now they seam to think there is no harm in it. Have they experienced such a change, by the change of the Constitution as to make Evil, to become good, & right to become wrong. I fear if we don't practice more on the principles of our Pious ancestors we shall be a miserable people; for no people can be happy, in this world or that which is to come without they are Virtuous & practice morality. It would be a great Blessing if people in general would endeavour to discontenance vice and folly more than they do, and incourage the oposite Virtue.  I now acknowledge the receipt of a letter from you a long time ago, which I ought to have acknowledged long since; it is now mislaid & I am not able to mention the date.  I have nothing of news to write you, & being in a great hurry must conclude by subscribing, Your real friend and very humble Servant, Artemas Ward  ""

  [January 2-3, 1781] Memoranda for Col. Laurens (1) I. Question. What is the Amount of the National debts. Answer 1. There is due on Loan Office Certificates to the 20th of Novemr 1780.  Dollars nominal money Value in Specie 60,263,458. 11,396,203.  Of this Sum 7,342,275 dollars draw Interest on bills of Exchange on France.  JANUARY 2, 1781  2. There is due the greatest part of the 200,000,000 of Dollars issued on paper bills of Credit: the whole ought to be redeemed by a monthly 15,000,000 Tax, required by Congress the 18th of March & to be paid in at 40 for one by the 1st of April next . . . 10,000,000 to be issued on new bills at par with Silver (in Place of the 200,000,000) payable with Interest at 6 per Cent-each State to fund its Quota on Solid Security and to Sink it's Share of principle & Interest by Annual Taxes: so that the whole shoud be cancelled at the End of Six years. 4/10ths of the New Emissions to be paid into the Continental Treasury and 6/10ths for the use of the Governments of the respective States. At present then consider the money of the Emissions of 200,000,000 of Dollars as creating a debt of 10,000,000 of Specie Dollars.  3. There is a Sterling Debt contracted on bills of Exchange drawn on Holland, Spain and France to the amount up to October 1780 of 295,048.12.6 Sterling.  4. If the Taxes demanded shoud be anticipated by Quarter Masters & Commissaries Certificates for Supplies to the Army in the year 1780, which is pretended, tho I State it Hypothetically: Then there will be due from the publick on these Certificates in Specie Value a further debt of 2,358,604 Specie dollars. The Grounds of this last Computation are conjectural and do not deserve entire Credit, but there [are] no materials to arrive at greater Certainty.  5. The Supplies of Cloathing, Artillery, Arms & Ammunition by France & Spain And the Commercial transactions form another capital Article of national Debt which I have not Materials at hand to ascertain.  6. The Pay & Subsistence Due to the Army is very Considerable & nearly a Million of Specie Dollars: Besides debts due on the Staff & Civil List to a large Amount.  II. Question. At what Sum do you estimate the Expences of the War from January 1781 to January 1782? Answer Estimate of provisions required from > Value Specie dollars the States by a Tax in kind....................> 4,357,012 A Tax on the several States in Specie > to be laid out for Forage estimated at ..> 1,642,988 The Expence of the Quarter Masters depart- > ment estimated on general principles at ........> 5,000,000 Pay and Subsistance of the new Army for ....> one year estimated accurately at ..................> 5,114,897.30/90 Specie dollars 16,114,897.30/90 N.B. Cloathing, Arms, Ammunition & other Supplies, you have the Estimate, and they are to be procured from France and Spain. NB. Material for Col Laurens to be informed that our Minister at Madrid gives us assurances that Spain has promised a Supply of Cloathing &c.  The raising the new Army for the War must prove a vast additional Expence to the people. I want data to fix it with any tolerable precision .-. At a modern estimate every Recruit will receive a bounty of 100 Specie dollars: on 20,000 it will amount to Two Millions specie Dollars. For extras you may make such an Addition as will bring the whole, exclusive of the Supplies of Cloathing, Arms & Ammunition expected from Europe. Twenty millions of Specie Dollars.  III. [Question.] What are the Ways and Means for defraying the Expences of the War for the year 1781? Answer. The last Campaign having been carried on chiefly by the Certificates of the Quarter Masters & Commissaries for Supplies, the Taxes of that year must necessarily be supplied to satisfy those Certificates; in other words the Certificates must be received for the Taxes; And no money being in the Treasury; we must look forward  to the predictions of the year 1781. 1st. Then the Tax of Specific Supplies & > Specie dollars the Tax for forage amount to > 6,000,000 2d. If the plan of the 18th of March  succeeds, we shall draw from it into the Treasury > 4,000,000 3. The People by draft or Contributions > will answer the Country [ . . . ] > 2,000,000 3d. We depend on a foreign Loan for 25,000,000 Livres equal in specie dollars to > 5,000,000 4. The produce of domestic Loans is uncertain. 5. So is that of an Impost of Trade if the States will agree to it.-  6. In the same manner every other plan of finance we attempted admits of no Certain Conclusions.  Upon the whole it is clear from these hasty Hints that Whatever may be the Success of our own Exertions the Loan of 25,000,000 of Livres in Europe is indispensably necessary: for a brilliant Campaign And this tis the point which Col. Laurens is interested to maintain. Jas. Duane  Philada. 2d Jany 1781.  If you shew this to the General (2) he will be able to correct one article, the Number of Recruites to be raised.(3) I only guess at it. With respect to Bounty which will be allowed each I am certainly within the mark: Virginia gives £1000 Contl. in hand, a Negroe between 10 and 30, or £60 specie & 300 Acres of Land at the End of the War to every Voluntier And one is to be issued on these Terms by every Class of 15 Inhabitants, the State only giving the Land.  P.S. As you did not proceed this morning according to your Intentions I have an oppertunity of giving you further Information.  IV. [Question.] What are the pay & Subsistance of a Regiment of  Cavalry, a Regiment of Infantry and a Regiment of Artillary respectively for one Month on the new Establishment? Answer.  The Establishment of each you'l See in the new Arrangement. Cavalry (1) The Number of officers & privates in a Dollars specie Legion are 450, of which 360 are privates and their pay & Subsistance for a Month is 5348.7.1/2 Number of Legions four.

(1) I do not find thro' the same Channel what was the nature of the Scrawl. I have, at some time, told you that I should aim to  JANUARY 2, 1781  persuade my Colleagues to keep back the last Rule laid down by the Assembly for the Government of the Delegates of Mass. in Congress because from the very wording of the Resolve as well as from your Letter of a Date which I cannot now recollect, I am convinced that the intent was to oblige not more than 3 to attend on the Duties of the Delegation. (2) I have so far prevailed as to get the Gentlemen to wait for some Explanation, but we have agreed to be all together punctual in attending to give our Voice, that we may not become culpable if such was the real intent of the Resolve; but this very day proves what I before wrote, that I could be much more usefully employed in my Chamber than here in Congress, a packet boat being under absolute order for Sailing to France.  The Paper of Dunlap is not a news Paper Today. Yours affectionately J.L.  MS not found; reprinted from Essex Institute Historical Collections, 13 (July 1876): 224.  (1) Not found.  (2) See Lovell to Holten, December 19, 1780, note 1. James Madison to Edmund Pendleton Dear Sir Philada. Jany 2d. 1781.  Yesterday's post was the first that has failed to bring me a line from you since our correspondence commenced. I hope it has not been owing to any cause which concerns your health.  We had it yesterday from under Genl Washington['s] hand, that another embarkation is actually departed from N. York, amoun[ting . . .] to abt. 2500 troops. There is little d[oubt] that they will steer the same course with the preceding detachments.(1) Congress are under great anxiety for the States agst. which this accumulating force is to be directed, and the more so as the principal means of their defence is so little in their power. It is not so much the want of men as the want of subsistance, arms & cloathing, which results from the want of money that gives the greatest alarm. A disposition appears to do every thing practicable for their relief and defence.  Mr. Harrison writes from Cadiz that the Combined fleets in that port, including 18 Ships from the W. Indies under Guichen, amounted to 68 Ships of the line. He offers no conjecture as to the manner in which they will be employed.(2)  I am Dr Sir Yrs Sincerely, J. Madison Junr.  ""

  Sir, Philadela. 2d. Jany. 1781 Probably you have heard that Mr. Dana is Appointed Minister to the Court of Russia-Mr. J Adams M P. (1) to that of Holland, Col J Laurens Minister for special Purposes, Viz to obtain Supplies JANUARY 2, 1781  &c. to that of France. Instead of this last Appointment it was the Opinion of a Number of Gentlemen that our Minister at the French Court ought to have been furnished with the Aid of an active, intelligent Secretary, which would not Occasion such disagreable Apprehensions which a Measure of this kind would probably excite.  Mr. Williams has wrote that the Reason why the Cloathing has not been Sent has been owing to a Quarrel between Capt. Landais and some of our other officers. This Acco. is not at present Satisfactory. Mr. Williams Says that the Supplies to the full Amo. expected will be soon here.  Mr. Vergennes Wrote to Mr J Adams in Regard to the Act of Congress of the 18t of March, and seemed to apprehend that the Act could not be justified, and supposed that the Subjects of France Possessors of Bills ought not to be affected by the Act. Mr. Adams made a particular answer to this Letter and Very justly Stated the Grounds upon which Congress proceeded. We have not since heard any more of this matter and probably never shall.  The present French Minister at the Head of the Maratime Department is said to be a Gentleman Active and Very friendly to the American Interest. A Mr. Cumberland Secretary to Ld. G. Germain has lately been at Madrid. This is supposed to be a Manuvre only on both sides for different Purposes and No great Uneasiness is excited thereby. The spanish Finances are at present a little deranged, So that no more Bills at present will [be] drawn upon Mr. Jay. Not any Very particular Information has been lately recd. from him.  Sr Harry Clinton has Wrote for Ten Thousand additional Troops to be sent over, this the B Court it is said have agreed to. The object of future Military Operations will be the Southern States. G Britain may not think it probable that she will be able to prosecute the War much longer, and may hope if she shall be Successful at the Southward to Settle the Terms of Peace upon an Uti Posedetis-But this will no[t] do. The Terms upon which the War is to be carryed on or Peace established Stand as they did.  It is said that Sr Harry Clinton will go again this Winter to the Southward with what Troops he can spare from N York, and that the late Embarkation was for this Purpose an Event perhaps not improbable.  We have no certain Acco. how the late parliamentary Election turned out. It is said and probably enough I think that the B. Ministry have got a Parliament to their Mind. This will I suppose indicate to the Warring Nations a Determination on the Part of G Britain to prosecute the War, The Consequence of that I suppose must be a more Vigorous Exertion to Curb that persevering Spirit which they must be convinced that the Opposition of Party nor the State of her Finances will Restrain. Perhaps the Temper of Neutral Powers will   more cheerfully Acquiesce in the Most Vigorous Exertions finding that Nothing else will produce such a Peace, as they Wish for. The B Court having an obsequious Parliament can with less trouble settle a Peace when they Shall chuse it. Wheither therefore their success in the Election will be unfavourable for us, cannot now be ascertained-if I was to Venture a Conjecture I should say that it would not.  As to the Condition of the Money here the Apparent Discount is 75 for 1-According to the Town Agreement. This Convention Occasioned an immediate Rise upon the hard money Price-the practical Discount is one hundred for one. This has been principally produced by the Vast Influx of Money from the Southward. This State has not only made their State late Emission which had been reluctantly recd of 40 for 1 a Tender equal in Value to Specie, but have put the New Bills issued according to Act of Congress upon the same footing. None of the New Bills have yet been issued by this State-and they are not yet current here. The New Bills have been brought from the Jerseys who have also made them a Tender as Pensylvania have done. But the Bills have not or but in a sparing Manner been recd. here. No New Bills have been issued at the Southward from hence that I know of. NC have not adopted the Money System. They have issued a large Quantity of State Bills which pass Cent per Cent below the old Continental Bills Altho these are at a great Discount. There is None of the 4/10s of the New Bills been recd by the Treasurer. Pensylvania are now collecting in the old Bills with a tolerable Degree of Industry.  Bills upon France drawn by Congress sell at 75 per Cent in Currency according to the Stated Rate of Depretiation. They do not undersel under any Apprehension that they will not be answered. Congress have had it in Contemplation upon a Report of a Committee which was long since Appointed, to provide some means extra to what has been already done for Supplying the Treasury. The Principal Expedient proposed is an Impost, to be Obtained of the States for Twelve years. The Dutys previouslly to be ascertained by Congress. Nothing on this Head is yet done and it is easy to See that Should Congress and the States adopt the Measure, it would be for a long Time unproductive of any Thing considerable. It must give a considerate Whig deep Chagrin to know that a Country So fertile, as to furnish the Philadelphia Market Weekly with Provisions collected within a small District sufficient to support G Washington Army upon their full establishment-and possessing almost endless Resources-Shall not adopt Measures Adequate to supply our Wants. But I will make no observations my Letter is already too long. I will only say that We are imbarrassed with a Currency not of more Value than half a Million Sterling which it seems as tho We could neither Use nor get rid of. Will it not be Necessary to put a Period to the  Existence of these Bills by the first of next May-and that what shall not then be collected the possessors shall be paid Specie for within a limited Time after the War?

  Sir, Bristol,(1) January 6, 1781.  The Committee of Congress (2) being informed that the troops are about to march to Trenton this night have concluded to remain at this place until they receive some intelligence from your Excellency; should you think it best we will set off immediately on the return of this express, or should it appear most adviseable we will remain here till we receive further information from his Excellency.  I have the honour to be most respectfully, Your Excellency's most obed. serv., By order of the Committee, Jno. Sullivan.  MS not found; reprinted from Hazard, Register of Pennsylvania, 2:166.  (1) During the evening of January 1, 1781, the 11 regiments of the Pennsylvania line under the command of Gen. Anthony Wayne in winter encampment near Morristown, N.J., mutinied and began marching toward Philadelphia. On the third, the mutineers entered and took control of Princeton, sent a delegation to confer with Wayne who had been following at a distance, and prepared to await the responses of Congress and Pennsylvania to their grievances. President Reed and a congressional committee appointed to confer with him on the crisis decided to set off toward Princeton, the committee agreeing to pause at Bristol, Pa., while Reed continued on to Trenton to coordinate negotiations. The entire story of the mutiny and the response of Continental and Pennsylvania officials to the crisis has been told in rich detail by Carl Van Doren, Mutiny in January (New York: Viking Press, 1943). Aspects of the work of this congressional committee can be traced in greater detail in the 19 documents originated by the committee and printed in this volume, and in its final report to Congress submitted on January 24. JCC, 19:79-83; and PCC, item 20, 2:101-6.  (2) This committee was appointed on the evening of January 3 to confer with Reed and the Pennsylvania Council immediately after Congress learned of the mutiny of the Pennsylvania line. Consisting of John Sullivan, John Witherspoon, and John Mathews, it was enlarged on the 5th with the appointment of Samuel J. Atlee and Theodorick Bland and empowered \""to take such measures as may appear necessary to quiet the disturbance in the Pensylvania line.\""JCC, 19:20, 25. During a meeting of the committee with the Council on the 5th, it was agreed that Reed and councilman James Potter would leave immediately for New Jersey and that the committee would follow the next morning, although Mathews remained in Philadelphia. Pa. Council Minutes, 12:593. The report that \""the troops are about to march to Trenton this night\"" proved to be erroneous, for the committee continued on to Trenton this same day, apparently on the advice of Reed in response to this brief letter.  President Reed's response to the Pennsylvania mutiny has been analyzed in John F. Roche, Joseph Reed A Moderate in the American Resolution (New York: Columbia University Press, 1956), pp. 182-87. Many of the surviving documents pertaining to the crisis, including Reed's correspondence with General Wayne and the leaders of the mutineers, and some of the committee's correspondence found nowhere else were published in three older sources: Samuel Hazard's Register of Pennsylvania, 2 (September-October 1828): 158-60, 164-68, 188-90, 204-6, 218-19; Theodorick Bland, The Bland Papers, ed.

  Sir Trenton Jany 7. 1781 10 oClock  The Committee arrived here last night & met with Mr President Reed who had been near Princeton & sent a Letter to General Wayne by two of his light horse. They were Suffered to proceed to the Genl. with the Letter unopened tho at the Request of the Sergeants showed it to them and it was to be read to the whole, this morning. There were Symptoms that they would be content with the Proposals & make the Matter up. It appears from all Accounts that they have behaved with surprising Regularity in all Respects (their Revolt excepted) and seemed disappointed that Mr Reed did not proceed & trust himself to them. He is this morning gone back & we are happy to inform you that Dr Shields is just come in and says that a Person from Gen. Clinton with another for his Guide had come to their Encampment & made them the Proposals of which the inclosed is a Copy.(1) They received it with so much firmness and Indignation that they not only rejected the Proposals but seized the two Agents & delivered them to General Wayne who sent them under a Guard and delivered them to Blair McLanachan and Alexr Nisbet two of the Light Horse who have them now in Custody.

It is recommended to them for their own Safety to move behind South River, and whenever they request it a Body of British troops shall protect them. It is needless to point out the Inability as well as want of Inclination in Congress to relieve them or to tell them the Severities that will be used by the Rebel leaders towards them should they think of Returning to their former Servitude. It will be proved to the Commissioners they Choose to Send that the Authority from whence this Comes is Sufficient to Ensure the Performance of the above proposals.

9636,dg016464,1781,Georgia Delegates Observations,"""Georgia Delegates' \""Observations\""
  [January 8, 1781] (1) OBSERVATIONS by the DELEGATES of GEORGIA.  From the most recent accounts that have been received from Europe, there is the greatest reason to expect that a new commission will issue from the court of London, for the purpose of again sounding the temper of America, upon the subject of a pacification; in which the state of Georgia, and perhaps that of South-Carolina, will not be regarded as part of the American Union, but excluded as having been again colonized to England by new conquest.  The uti possidetis also has been much talked of in Europe, as a probable basis for the peace; and this report, although rejected with marks of abhorrence by all descriptions of men in America, circulates with terrors, as it is pretended to be drawn from the armed Neutrality.  The people who would be particularly affected by the operation of such principles, ought to fear every thing; although justice, humanity and the interests of America, and her friends, forbid them to dread any thing. They united in the one cause, and have sacrificed their blood and fortunes in it's support; and therefore it would be unjust and JANUARY 8, 1781  inhuman, for the other parts of the Union, separately to embrace the result of the common efforts, and leave them under the yoke of a bankrupt and enraged tyrant. To preserve the States entire, is the object of the alliance with France, and it cannot be the interest of the other great branch of the family compact, that we should again make a part of the British empire.  We will not, however, enter into any farther discussion of this subject, than will be sufficient to shew the importance of the question as it respects our own State, leaving to others to speak of their interests.  In point of commerce, no part of North-America has given such presages of importance, as the colony and state of Georgia. From the conclusion of the last war, when it could scarcely be called a province of England, to the commencement of the present, the rapid increase of it's exports is scarcely to be equalled in any part of the world, as appears by Brown's aggregate, [see page 11](2) and other authentic documents.  The principal articles of exportation before the war, were rice, indigo, and skins, to Europe, and lumber, horses, and provisions to the West-Indies: but since, the necessities of the citizens, and the liberty left to every man to pursue his own schemes, have been the source of new discoveries.  Tobacco has been cultivated with the most astonishing success, by men who have emigrated from Virginia. Upon trial, it has been found, that both the climate and the soil are better adapted to the cultivation of this plant than those of Virginia: the vegetation being more rapid, and the season longer, the planter is enabled to produce two good crops in the year; whereas one only can be obtained in Virginia and Maryland. The face of the earth is less broken, and, therefore, the soil is richer, although of the same species: nor is the quality otherwise than superior. About the beginning of this war, Mr. Hammond made several hogsheads from a field at the Walnut Hills near Augusta, which, being sent to London, sold for a farthing per pound more than the best from Virginia and Maryland; although he had not all the conveniences (it being the first attempt) necessary for the well-curing the plant. It is a fact, that, had the State remained uninterrupted by the enemy's army, two thirds of the planters, in the year 1779, would have turned their attention almost wholly upon tobacco, it being in more demand than rice or indigo.  Upon several other trials also, it has been found, that hemp and cotton grow in the greatest luxuriance, and may be cultivated to much advantage: and the interior country abounds in iron ore.  Advantages such as these, apply of themselves: but when we consider the amazing variety, and extensive usefulness of the productions of this State, the parties in this war against England must see, in a still stronger point of view, the necessity of keeping it out of her hands.  This is not all: an object of still greater importance must be considered. The coast of Georgia is approached by a gradual ascent from the gulph   of Florida, which runs nearly parallel with it; and her bars and inlets are superior to any on the southern part of the Continent. She has besides, the best timbers in the world for building ships of war: her islands and seaboard abound in live-oak trees; the wood of which is the firmest and most resisting against assaults, and the least prone to decay, of any which has yet been discovered. Some time before this contest, the British merchants in Georgia were encouraged by government, to build large merchant vessels of this timber, with a view to convert them into frigates, in case of a war which was then near taking place with France. The scheme, however, was not pursued far, on account of the dispute with America.  Congress too, since the war, have been so sensible of the utility of getting ships of this wood, that, in the latter end of the year 1776, they directed the Marine Committee to send persons to Georgia to cut timbers for a seventy-four gun ship, and four frigates. Moulds were made in Philadelphia, and Mr. Donaldson was employed, and went and cut the timbers, and planned a continental yard upon Sutherland's Bluff, along side of which a seventy-four gun ship, it is said, can ride with perfect safety, and near which place the timbers now lie. This gentleman, upon his return to Philadelphia, reported to the marine office, that the best of timbers of every kind, for building any number and sizes of ships, might be had in Georgia. However, this plan of augmenting the American marine could not be prosecuted, the enemy having got possession of the coast in the latter part of the year 1778.  An extract of an official letter to the Marine Committee, now in the admiralty-office at Philadelphia, from Mr. Wereat, the Agent of Congress in that State, and who had resided upon different parts of the Sea-board upwards of twenty years, will give some idea of the importance of this object. He says: \""The live-oak timber in this State is exceeding good and plenty: it is to be found for large ships, in the greatest quantity, upon the sea-islands. The largest I have observed is on the island of Black-beard, which is not far from the middle of our coast. Sappelo inlet is the best water of any on this part of the continent: from the best information, there is about five fathom at high water, and a fine bold channel from thence up to Sutherland's Bluff, on the main land, distant about twelve miles, on and near which place there is good timber.  \""There is likewise to be got near this spot, fine pine timber for plank, which may be cut from thirty to fifty feet long, and upwards.  \""There is another place about forty miles to the southward of the former, very proper for the same purpose, called Brunswick, which has a communication by St. Simon's inlet, at the south end of the island of that name. It has a good bar, and a forty gun ship has been in there at the first settlement of the country by General Oglethorpe. If I recollect right, there is twenty-five feet upon the bar at high water, and a good channel.  \""There are some other considerations, which may be worthy the notice of your board, which are the inexhaustible resources we have for naval stores; and our fine winters, in which season snow is not seen once in several years; and near the sea-side not much frost. The above circumstances taken together, in my opinion, make this State the most proper for building ships of war, of any of the thirteen. \""  Besides the capacious inlets mentioned in the foregoing letter, and upon which the most commodious yards and docks might be erected, those to Savannah, Ogeechie, and Sunbury, are well known for their safety and convenience. To which may be added, those of New-port, Little Satilla, Great Satilla, Turtle River, and Saint Mary's, each of corresponding utility to the State, but which, from it's infancy, have not yet been much used: all, however, capable of being made useful ports for trade, and which most certainly will be the case, as the country back of them becomes settled.  From all these considerations, it inevitably follows, that the State of Georgia is a material part of the Union, and cannot be given up without affecting it's essential interests, if not endangering it's existence. It seems to be almost universally acknowledged, that it is not only the interest of France and Spain, but of all Europe, Great Britain only excepted, that the bulk of North-America should constitute an Independent Power:-Upon this ground, therefore, and notwithstanding little mutinies, which have happened in all States in the same circumstances, we presume, unquestionably, that there will remain a free confederacy of republics, maugre all the redoubled efforts of the enemy. But we will venture to pronounce, that, should both the Carolinas, or the farther one and Georgia, be left in the power of England at the conclusion of a peace, she will dare to repeat her haughty pretensions to a superior commerce, and the dominion of the ocean.  She would be able to refit and rebuild her ships by the timber in those States; to extend her settlements, in a short time, back to the Missisippi, by emigrants from Great-Britain and Ireland, the refugees, and all the tories of America, whom she would surely invite thither; and, by such means, restore her commerce.(3)  The Southern Colonies, by the treaty of Paris, were bounded by the river Missisippi: but that treaty being now done away by reciprocal hostilities, if any of those States should be recovered and kept by the enemy, no doubt the ancient pretensions to the South Sea will be revived. Be this as it may, there is sufficient scope within the lines of Georgia, east of the Missisippi, for the most enterprizing possessor. The main branch of Savannah river, by which it is bounded on the north, running a north-west course to it's source, widens the country exceedingly, and presents an unappropriated tract of about five hundred miles in length, and two hundred and fifty in breadth, of land the most to be preferred of any in North-America, on account   of the temperature of the climate, the fertility of the soil, and the facilities of the most extensive navigation.  And here it should be recollected, that there are several valuable rivers which have their source in the interior parts of Georgia, and which running southerly through the narrow parts of West-Florida, empty themselves into the bay of Mexico; the lands upon which, being intermediate between the Bay and the Atlantic, are most invitingly fertile and healthy: and should England have possession of this State, can there be a doubt but her subjects would presently settle upon those lands, and claim the navigation into and through the Bay? The genius and character of that people answer the question. Would not then the Spanish settlements be liable to encroachment, and the whole kingdom consequently exposed to a new war?  But farther with respect to Spain-Should England have it in her power to keep a fleet in the harbours of South-Carolina and Georgia, with the resulting advantages of having always fresh supplies of men and provisions, would not the Spanish trade, to and from South America, be greatly exposed? At the same time that the stength of the nation is admitted, the length of these voyages should be considered, as well as the intermediate position of the country about which we are speaking. Should England, therefore, by these means, be able to controul the trade of Spain, is it not probable, that, having lost ground, among the hardy sons of the North, she would ere long conceive the project of augmenting her dominions in the South?  On the contrary, however, should the freedom of these States be preserved; and be in amity with Spain, the greatest safety will not only result to her trade, but particular advantages arise from their situation and produce: such as friendly ports in distress, supplies of fresh provisions, &c.  With regard to France, there is so fixed a confidence in it's great Monarch, who has honoured us with his alliance, and whose court is so illustrious for wisdom and policy, that we have a perfect reliance upon his persevering in the war, until the freedom and independence of all the States of the Union to which he is allied, shall be established. From that period, she will begin to experience the rewards of her generous services to America-Her commerce in general will be encreased, and her islands easily supplied; and most extensively and conveniently from the two Southern States. In that of Georgia alone, sufficient lumber might be had to rebuild all the towns of the West Indies, and pitch and tar enough for the fleets of the world-We will not believe that she will ever consent, that such great resources should remain in the power of her unceasing Enemy.  As to America, no part of it could expect to be free long, while England retains both ends of the Continent. In possession of the waters of the St. Lawrence and the Missisippi, with a fleet upon the Atlantic, she would seize a moment to encircle the whole. It should  not, therefore, be expected, that any propositions, touching the surrender of those States, will ever be made or acceded to in America.  But Great-Britain says that she has already got possession: so she had of Boston, Rhode-Island, Philadelphia, &c.  We conclude these remarks, by repeating as our opinion, what has been said all over Europe and America, that the two Southern States, being the feeble part of the Continent, in point of numbers and compactness of settlement, can be recovered only by a naval superiority: to which object, therefore, we could wish to fix the attention of all those whom it concerns.

  Philada. Jan. 8th. 1781 Yes-I will try it. To one of the most sensible, virtuous & consequently most lovely of the Loveliest Sex it will drop its Ink in Paragraphs of calmer Stile than for the last fifteen minutes. My Penknife formed it at first for the Purposes of Friendship; whence then such a Flow of Bitterness and Execration? All this too to the Husband of Portia! Will he become a Distributor of such Evil? No, He is more philosophic, more benevolent & wise. He can exquisitely feel an Injustice done to his Country, but he will not suffer himself to be transported beyond the Language of grave Censure. It must, however, be acknowledged that the Provocation was great. Let an appeal be made to the Throne of Complacency. Listen then, Portia. I had according to your wish superscribed your Letter to Mr. Adams(1) to go by the Brig Duke of Leinster that will sail for Europe probably Tomorrow. To wish him every Happiness myself while I conveyed a real Portion of it from you was the main Intent of my adding a new Cover.(2) Fresh Ideas sprang. Facts came forward on my memory. The Pensylvania Line are mutinous, yet have they given up two Spies of Clinton's who were tempting them with most seductive Promises. Should such virtuous Soldiers be bare backed & barefooted Subjects of Temptation? By a Vessel which left France late in November I yesterday received Copies of Letters dated in March and April last year telling of Cloathes going from Nantes to Brest, to Rochelle, here there, to & fro to be shipped for America, Satan knows when.(3) Tis plain not before January 1781. This Thought was too much for my  JANUARY 8, 1781  Pen; away it flew over the Paper Gall here, Gall there, Gall & Bitterness every where. I doubted whether it would again ever become fit for civil Purposes. I took it therefore a second Time in Hand just now, with Hesitancy, to acknowledge the Receipt of your Favor of Decr. 25th.(4)  Why did you strive to make me vile in my own Eyes? I \""renounce all Connexion with your Sex\""!!! Then should I be vile indeed. I entreat you, charming Lady, to consider that the Letter of Recommendation which you say I had not noticed is the very one in which you ask \""Can he suffer Letters repeatedly to reach him and not deign a Line in Reply\""? And was also the identical one of September 3d to which I had Reference in mine of November 27th, and which I had also acknowledged on the 21 st as Jemmy Rivington well knows,(5) tho he does not tell it in print. I cannot say when I inclosed the Bills of Exchange but I do not find my memoranda in my Almanack cancelled by the mark of your Acknowledgement, June 13, July 17 & 21 and Sepr. 26.(6) Perhaps those were only a few Lines of Cover to news papers.  It was only last Week that I had the Pleasure of seing Mr. Brown whom I acquainted with your Kind mention of his name & Person to me, as I had before done in regard to Doctr. Lee. I am out with both those Gentlemen, for tho they expressed their Admiration of you yet they did it not with that extraordinary fervor which accords with my own Sentiments, and which I think an Hour's Conversation with you demands.  Col. Palfrey sailed some time ago. J. P. Jones was at L'Orient Novr. 17th. Should he arrive here, depend upon my Attention to what he may bring for you. Mr. Dana is appointed to proceed as minister to Russia; but I am almost decided in Mind that he will not incline to accept the Mission. Col. J Laurens will be in Boston by the Time this reaches you, and, if he does not ride to Braintree, you can not fail to hear of him by Gen. Warren.  This Evening four Years I passed with you at yr. Brother Cranche's.(7) Did I imagine on the Noon of that day I was thus long to be seperated from a most amiable Wife? No indeed; nor can I boast of the Patriotism that would have mounted me then on Horseback under such Ideas, with a chearful Resolution. Yrs. affectly., JL  ""

  Dear Sir, Jan. 8th. 1781 Herewith goes a Letter which I this day recd. from Mrs. Adams(1) with a request that I would superscribe it and delivers it to the Care of Colonel Palfrey, or of some other, he being gone.  The Discontent in the Pensylvania Line of the Army can give the Enemy no solid Satisfaction; for, an evident Proof that it does not rise from Disaffection to our Cause has been given by a Discovery & Delivery made by them of two Spies from Clinton, sent to make them the most tempting offers. Perhaps the Gazette Tomorrow may be minute on this Point.  I was yesterday vexed by a Packet of Mr. Jona. Williams's Letters Sextuples I imagine of Dates March, Apr &July tho the Vessels left France in November. It is poor Comfort to our Soldiers this Janry. to know that last March and April Cloathing was sent from Nantes to Brest & Rochelle. The Execrations of Thousands are sent out to fall upon the right Pate, be it where it may.  I am not willing to give a decided Opinion upon the strange Appearances in the Conduct of our Affairs in France till I shall see each Man's Story from his own Pen, but it is almost too much to be obliged to wait from May 21 st last year till now for such Information.  I hope the Powers made out for you by Congress similar to those for Mr. Laurens of Novr. 1st. 1779 may prove usefull according to your expressed Fancy;(2) It is even now, as heretofore, our misfortune to be months behind hand in our measures; had Mr. Searle carried what now goes, we ought have been reaping the first Fruits of the Trial, to our great Satisfaction.  If we go into the Choice of a Minister or Secretary of Finance there will be some Chance of Secrecy in Measures by which the Currency might be reduced before Speculators were aware of it, and the Public might make Savings for the People in Spight of their own Plots against Themselves: For, I cannot help using an Expression justified by what is every day before my Eyes. The Interest on the new Bills must be paid; if they are issued at 40 and expended at that, while Exchange is wickedly called eighty. He that with 80 old purchases two new gets ten per Ct. Interest, to be raised out of the Labour of the Land hereafter. Pensylvania & Jersey make Tendry Laws, Mass. lets exchange take its Course hence a new Speculation. We must obtain some permanent Fund from the States on which to build Plans of Finance before we can have a fair Prospect of borrowing from  JANUARY 8, 1781  Strangers. Faith, Words will not answer to our own monied chaps much less to Foreigners.  The States are 179 mills. of old Dollars behind upon our past Calls and such has been the Depreciation since the Estimates founding those Calls that the whole if now in hand would be but a pittance very inadequate to present Necessities. If Maryland was fully in Confederation, I do not see that our Capacity for the necessary Vigor of a Time of War would be much bettered. I am at this moment much under the Influence of those Ideas which founded the Stadtholderate according to your History of it; but the Stadtholder does not manage the Finances. Therein the People must look out for, and be true to themselves.  The Enemy have met with many Disasters at the Southward, but yet they will be immensely troublesome to us in that Part unless we can get their Facility of Transportation.  Major Rogers was yesterday brought Prisoner in a little Schooner taken by Capt. Reid from France just off Penobscot River. The Major looks much out of Place.  Norton Braylesford from Boston tells me Monsr. Ternay died of the hyde Park Fever catched from the fr. General.  Yrs. affectionately, JL  [P.S. ] I hope the Enemy have no Letters from you to yr.

  Please your Excellency Philadelphia Jany. 8th 1781 About 8 oClock last Monday night the Pensylvania line mutinyed the 1st & 5th Regiments remained on the ground, but were forced by the others to Join, Two Captains were killed, Several Subalterns & privates wounded in attempting to Suppress them-they marched in a body to Prince Town, in Spite of every Effort their officers to  JANUARY 8, 1781  reduce them to order-where they remain under the Command of the Sergeants with guards posted, Genl Waine, Cols. Stewart & Buttler are at Prince Town, to whom the Mutineers have Sent a guard. President Reed went to Princetown last Friday & a Committee from Congress are at Trentown.  Their Greivances are 1st: that many of them enlisted for three years or during the war-& are held in Service over the three years by vertue of Such enlistment. 2nd: that they have not received their pay or Cloathing-but what had great influence in raising the mutiny was-recruiting Officers Coming among them with hard money to enlist the Seven months men who had received large Sums for the Seven months Service. This was too much for them to bear. Last Saturday a Spy with a guide from Genl Clinton Came into their Camp with proposals a Copy of which is enclosed. They took them both & Sent them with the proposals to Genl Wayne-who Sent them to Trenton where they are Safely lodged in goal.  Two vessels arrived yesterday from France but bring no public despatches. They were but partly freighted Saw the public Cloathing at LOreant Could have Brot. Some of them but no body appeared to Ship them altho, they advertised their want of freight-however they Say that a large east India man is Coming round to LOreant to take them in-they say that 9 Ships of the line & 4,000 Troops are at Nants ready to Sail Supposed to be for America.  No New material from the Southward Since my last-the embarkation that lately took place at Newyork under Arnold, Genl. Washington Informs Consisted of about 1600 men and Are supposed to be gone to the Southward. The Time for paying the army is arrived-the plan of the 18th of March last is productive of very little Money yet-& appears more & more dubious. I think there must be a total reform of the system. Congress must exercise the proper powers & Establish all the necessary Executive boards & offices- and as the Wealth of a nation is the aggregate wealth of its Citizens- the spring of industry and economy the prospect of advantage, which, prospect, will be more or less Opperative according to the Opinion the people have of the Justice of the government under which they live, the Security it affords to property & the liberty it gives to every one to make the most of what they have to put off in an honest way- to remove therefore all fetters & our embarressments on Trade, except with the Enemy, omit to force upon any person paper bills for money-& to take measures to encourage Industry & OEconomy, & to revive the Confidence of the people in the Justice of their rulers. I think is the only natural & wise method to extricate Ourselves from our present embarrassments into which we are brot. in Some measure by unnatural Expedients.  This will lay a foundation to enable the Citizens to pay largely for the public use of & give government firmness & Support-but  every Expedient must be attempted before we will Consent to Adopt those plain, easy & natural methods which are the only paths to wealth, peace & safety.  Jany. 9th by letters from Fredericksburg (1)-48 Sail appeared in Chesepeak bay last Saturday Supposed to be the detachment which lately Sailed from Newyork under Arnold. Col.

  Sir, Philadelphia 8th January 1781 Was I to give you my Sentiments at large upon the political Situation of the United States, it would lead me into a Labyrinth of Deductions, too tedious for my present Leisure, and too complicate for your Amusement. Without entering therefore into the Infinity of Circumstances which at present form the Embarrassments of our Systems, it will be sufficient to observe, that the Want of Money  JANUARY 9, 1781  and Credit involve Congress in Perplexities, which cannot be fully removed 'till the Operations of New Plans shall be equally felt throughout the Union. The Want of a fixed Confediration frustrates almost every Measure, and the dull, inergetic Mode of Proceedure, resulting from the long Habits of insipid Formality, render our Efforts too feeble and dilatory to effect the greatest Objects. Party Intrigues have some Share in our Councils, but they are far from influencing in Matters of General Utility. Whenever they are attempted, they appear rather under the Garb of expiring Struggles, than in the Expectation of Success.  The Army have been without Pay for a Long Time, which, added to some other Causes, produced on the first Instant, a general Mutiny in the Pennsylvania Line. Two Officers were killed & two wounded, About six Privates were Slain, and the Insurrection is not yet quelled. Sir Henry Clinton Sent an Emissary among the MalContents With mighty Promises of Money, Protection &c. &c. But the Lads, so far from being disaffected with the American Cause, reccived his Offers with Indignation, and sent the Spy with his Conductor, & a Copy of the Proposals to Gen Waine.

  Sir Philada. Jany 9th. 1781 The inclosed extract of a letter from General Washington No. 1 will give your Excellency a more particular account of the late embarkation from N. York than has been before obtained.(1) On Thursday last Congress were informed by General Potter & Col. Johnston who came expresses for the purpose that a general mutiny of the Pennsylvania line stationed near Morris Town apart  JANUARY 9, 1781  from the rest of the Army had broken out on the morning of New Year's day.(2) Every effort was used by the Officers to stifle it on its first appearance but without effect. Several of them fell victims to the fury of the Mutineers. The next information came from Genl Wayne who wrote from Princeton whither the troops had marched in regular order on their way to Philada. as they gave out, with a determination not to lay down their arms nor return to their obedience till their grievances should be redressed. They did not suffer any of their Officers to remain with them except Genl Wayne and Colns. Steuart & Butler and these they kept under a close guard, but in every other respect treated with the utmost decorum. The greivences complained of were principally a detention of many in service beyond the term of enlistment & the sufferings of all from a deficient supply of Cloathing & subsistance & long arrearage of pay. Several propositions & replies on the subject of redress passed between a deputation of Sergeants on the part of the Troops & General Wayne, but without any certain tendency to a favorable issue. The Affair at length took a very serious aspect and as a great proportion of that line are foreigners and not a few deserters from the British Army, and as they shewed a disposition to continue at Princeton from whence a refuge with the Enemy who it was said were coming out in force to avail themselves of the situation of things, was very practicable, it was thought necessary to depute a Committee of Congress with powers to employ every expedient for putting a speedy end to it. The President of the State with a number of Gentlemen from this place also went up to interpose their influence. The inclosed copy of a Letter from the Committee No. 2 with the paper No. 3 referred to in it are the last accounts received of the matter.(3) The manner in which the offers of emissary of Clinton were received & treated is a very auspicious circumstance & will probably in its impression on the enemy fully balance the joy & encouragement which this event tended to give them.  Col. Bland being one of the Committee does not join me in this.  I have the honor to be with great respect & esteem Yr. Excelly's obt. & hum. serv, James Madison Jnr.  ""

  Dr. Sr. Philada. Jany 9th. 1781 I have again the pleasure to begin with acknowledg. the receipt of a favor from you, that of the 1st inst. having come to hand yesterday. (1)  On Thursday last Congress were informed by Genl. Potter & Col Johnston who came Expresses for the purposes that a general mutiny had broken out on the morning of New year's day in the Pennsylvania line which was cantoned near Morris Town apart from the rest of the Army. Every effort was used by the Officers to stifle it in its infancy but without effect. Several of them fell victims to the fury of the Mutineers. The next information came from Genl Wayne who wrote from Princeton whither the troops had marched in regular order on their way to Philada. as they gave out with a determination not to lay down their arms nor return to their obedience till a redress of grievances should be obtained. They suffered none of their officers to be among them except Genl Wayne & Colns. Steuart & Butler and these they kept under close guard, but in every other respect treated with the utmost decorum. The grievances complained of were principally a detention of many in service beyond the Term of Enlistment & the sufferings of all from a deficient supply of cloathing and subsistence and the long arrearage of pay. Several propositions & replies on the subject of redress passed between a deputation of Sergeants in behalf of the Troops & Genl Wayne but without any certain tendency to a favorable issue. The affair at length began to take a very serious countenance and as a great proportion of that line are foreigners & not a few deserters from the British Army and as they shewed a disposition to continue at Princeton from whence a refuge with the Enemy who it was said were coming out in force for the purpose, was at any moment practicable, it was thought necessary, notwithstanding the humiliation of the step to depute a Committee of Congress with powers to employ every expedient for putting a speedy end to the discontents. The President of the State with a number of Gentlemen from this place also went up to interpose their influence. By a letter from the Committee who had proceeded as far as Trenton recd. the evening before last, it appears that the President who was ahead & had written in to Genl Wayne was likely to have a confidential reception. The Committee also write that an Emissary of Clinton who had appeared among the Soldiers with a paper setting forth the folly & danger of adhering to a cause which had already brought so much misery upon them, promising a protection under the British Govt, a body of troops to cover their escape, & payment of all arrears due from Congress, was siezed & given up to Genl Way[n]e Who handed him with his guide over to  JANUARY 9, 1781  the President of this State, who placed them under the custody of his lighthorse. This circumstance not only presages a fortunate issue to the Mutiny, but is such a proof of attachment to the Country in the most trying situation as must effectually repress the joy & encouragement which the Enemy had taken from this threatening event. (1) The late detachmt from N. York which a letter from Fredg.(2) says is in Chesapeak is abt. 1600 strong & commanded by Arnold.  I am Yrs Sincerely, J. Madison Junr.  ""

  Sir Philadelpa 9th Jany. 1781 I Enclose to your Excellency an Order of Congress for printing the civil Constitutions of the Several States.(1) As the Charter of the former Colony would be improper to put amongst these Publications-A Correct Account therefore of the governing Principles of that Charter and the fundamental Laws of the State relative thereto, seems to be what is necessary-Unless in the Account of the Constitution We derive it's Origin from an earlier Period than the Charter, which I suppose May be done if it shall be tho't best, and in that Veiw consider the Charter only as a Confirmation of that Constitution which was derived from the Voluntary Convention of the Ancient Settlers of the former Colony. As the Publication of the Constitution of the State of Connecticut under this order of Congress, ought to be quite Correct and will be considered as Authentick and perhaps will be required to be attested as such, I therefore do not think it proper for Me, immersed in the Vanity of dayly Business here, to give a formal Account of our Constitution, when perhaps some Error or Omission might be productive of Consequences which cannot now be easily foreseen. I think it therefore my Duty to Request that your Excellency, would please to transmit An Account of the Constitution of our State, for the Publication intended-I will observe to your Excellency that this present Measure has been at this Time Adopted upon the Recommendation of Mr. J Adams, for foreign Information-And that most of the Constitutions of the States are now ready for Publication and that therefore unless the Acco. of the Constitution of Connecticut is soon had, it will Occasion a Delay.  The Condition of the Money here continues much as it was when I did myself the Honour to Write last to your Excellency. None of JANUARY 9, 1781  the New Bills of the 18th of March have been yet issued in this State. By Act of Government the Bills which shall issue upon the Credit of this State are made a Tender of 75 for one. The Old Currency which has yet been brought into the Treasury of this State has issued to procure Supplies. The New Bills cannot be Said to have a Currency in this City. A Clothier from Jersy, a few Days ago brought a large Sum of the New Bills of that State here to lay them out to procure Supplies, but could not Purchase with them the Supplies wanted. A Very few of the New Bills have issued in Maryland-That State gave Liberty to any Person to Exchange the old Bills for the New at 33 1/3 for one. This Act is said Now to be altered and the Exchange is at 40 for one. I shall Make No observations upon these Facts, only observe that unless the united States as such can Establish a Fund, and possess the sole Power of regulating whatever can be called Money within all the United States, I do not See how any kind of publick Credit can be supported. A Superintending Power destitute of any Estate, any Funds, any Power to establish Such, or to controul or regulate the Money of a Country, is perhaps a Novelty in the History of Mankind. Congress have been frequently Considering the Subject of their Finances. They have Adverted lately to the Subject, and this perplexing Affair will be probably be farther reviewed. To obtain a Cession from the State to regulate all foraign Commerce, to impose Such Dutys on Trade as Congress shall think proper pro Bono publico-to call upon the States for their Plate- and an unequivical Cession of their unlocated Territory, will probably be the principal Objects of Deliberation-And in the Mean Time to devise some expedient for the Immediate Pay of the Army. At present We have no certain Prospect of being able to answer this last most pressing Demand, Soon as We Wish for As the Calls of the Army are Very Urgent.  Col Root informs Me that he has Wrote to your Excellency.(2) I should not therefore have troubled you by the present Post, were it not to have Obtained the Constitution of the State. He has doubtless transmitted Such Intelligence as We have.  I am with the greatest Regard, your Excellencys Most Obedient Servant, Oliver Wolcott  ""

This was referred to the board of War. He now complains that the board has not reported on that matter and he desires to know whether Congress will continue him in service and employ him in negotiating between the United States & the court of Prussia or in the line of the Army or in both. As to  JANUARY 12, 1781  the matter of negotiatg. the Baron having no letters of credence nor other documents to prove that he is authorised to act in behalf of his court I believe Congress will not deign to take any notice of his pretentions.

You can easily judge whether the situation of our affairs & the justice due to the officers who have been exposing their lives in the service while he was absent will admit of a compliance with this demand.

  Jan. 13, 1781 I (1) enclose you an extract of a letter from General Washington of the 2d instant,(2) giving a more precise account of the embarkation from New York on the 20th ulto. than has been before obtained. On the night of the 1st instant a mutinous spirit which had been for some time working in the Pennsylvania Line of the Army broke out with such violence that the utmost efforts of the Officers were insufficient to suppress it. Two of them unhappily fell victims to the fury of the Mutineers, after completely shaking of[f] all military authority they proceeded in an entire body and in regular order to Princeton with an intention as they gave out to come on to this city  JANUARY 13, 1781  and with a determination neither to lay down their arms nor return to their obedience until their grievances should be redressed. These consisted principally in the detention of many in service beyond the term of enlistment, and the sufferings of all from deficient supplies of cloathing and provisions, and the long arrearage of pay, contrary to their first plan they declined coming to this place and established their encampment at Princeton, where they entered into negotiations with Genl. Wayne, Lt. Cols. Stuart & Butler (the only officers they suffered to remain among them and whom they kept under close confinement, although in every other respect they treated them with the utmost decorum) on the subject of redress. The nature of some of their demands and the manner of their proceeding gave at length a very serious countenance to the affairs, and as the proximity of Princeton to a place of junction with the Enemy was surmised to be the probable motive of their stopping at that place, as it was confidently alleged that the Enemy were coming out in force to avail themselves of the event, and as many of the troops were foreigners & not a few deserters from the British Army it was thought best to appoint a Committee with full powers to take the necessary steps for quieting the disturbance as speedily as possible. In consequence of the appointment the Committee judged it advisable to proceed immediately to meet the Troops. The President of the State with several other Gentlemen from this place had set out for the same purpose a little time before then. The information since received both from the forces & the latter is, that the President had met with a confidential reception from the troops, that they had given up to him & Genl. Wayne, an emissary and guide from Clinton with a flattering invitation to them to take sanctuary from their miseries & the resentment of those who had usurped the public authority, under the British Government, that they had been prevailed on to come forward as far as Trenton where an accommodation of principles of equity was pretty far advanced & in a sure train of being soon completed, & that the emissary & guide were under sentence of death, and would be executed yesterday morning.  Reprinted from Madison, Papers (Hutchinson), 2:283-84, from an extract printed in Stan V. Henlsels Catalogue, no. 988 (1909).  (1) Madison appears to have written this letter as a personal communication to Greene, who later acknowledged it as such, rather than as a member of the committee to correspond with the commanding officer of the southern department. Madison's editors were in error in believing otherwise, mistakenly assuming that the committee's chairman, John Mathews, was in Trenton at this time with the committee on the Pennsylvania mutiny. Madison, Papers (Hutchinson), 2:285n.2. Mathews had, however, remained in Philadelphia, and indeed wrote a letter to Greene in behalf of the corresponding committee on January 9, which is printed above.  2 See Madison to Thomas Jefferson, January 9, 1781, note 1.

  Sir, Trenton Jany. 13th 1781 The dispute with the Pensylvania line being happily terminated, I take the liberty of giving your Excellency a short account, of the rise and progress, of this unexpected and surprizing revolt(1)  Many of the Men were held by inlistments which expressed the term of service to be for three years, or during the war. As three years began to expire about the first of Jany. they enquired of their Officers, whether they were to expect their discharges at the end of that Period. The Officers in general supposed the term of inlistment was not to expire but with the war. This construction gave them much uneasiness, which was increased by some arrearages of pay (which they were to have received from the State) not being furnished. And though the State had taken measures for paying those arrears, unfortunately the intelligence had not reached them previous to the first of Jany. These were the real sourses of the mutiny; for though there were some other greivances common to the American, as well as other Armies, they have never mentioned these as having any weight, in their proceedings. The two first affected a great part of the divisions: who used every art to induce others to support them in their intended revolt; which they were the more encouraged to attempt as they were sixty miles distant from the main Army.  The affair was conducted with so much secrecy that the Officers had not the most distant suspicion of it till the evening of the first of Jany. when hearing that the Troops were in Arms they repaired to the parade and not supposing it was general exerted themselves to quell the mutiny. The Soldiers in general shew no disposition to injure their Officers though some who were intoxicated with Liquor discharged their Muskets, killd one Officer and wounded three or four. Part of the division moved a few miles that evening, and the remainder followed them the next morning when the whole assumed a military order under the command of their Sergeants and marched without offering the least insult to the inhabitants except in one instance for which the Culprit was immediately apprehended and delivered over to the civil power. The inhabitants say that on their march they never suffered the soldiers to enter their houses even for water, nor was any article taken from them during their march. Upon their taking post, at Princeton, it began to be suspected that their intentions were to join the enemy but they persevered in their declaring, their detestation of the British and their attachment to the cause of their Country. They said they were only seeking a redress of grievances, which when obtained they would cheerfully return to their duty. And if the enemy appeared in the interim they would fight them with desperation. This however was not fully credited;  JANUARY 13, 1781  untill they seized and brought to Genl. Waine, who with Col. Butler and Stewart remained among them, without command two British emissaries from Sir Henry Clinton with a written invitation promising them great rewards if they would march to South River about 20 miles distant from Princeton where he would cover them with a body of British Troops. The Spies were delivered over to Genl Waine and after Governor Reeds arrival to him, but afterwards by their request returned to them. The board of Sergeants who had assumed the command issued orders next morning; stating the facts and declaring that the Pensylvania line dispised a treachery and meanness like that of Benedict Arnold, that their views were honorable and their attachment to the cause of their Country unalterable, and they were only seeking redress of grievances from men of Honor. When Governor Reed came to Princeton they received him with every mark of respect and esteem. They mentioned to him the grounds of their complaints which were principally the two first mentioned. He made them some proposals and communicated from the Committee of Congress which were readily accepted. They were then requested to march to Trenton which they agreed to, and delivered to the Committee of Congress the two spies sent from Sir Henry Clinton; who were tried by a board of Officers-Condemned and executed on the 11th Inst. The Committee of Congress have appointed Commissioners to determine respecting their inlistments, to discharge such as are intitled thereto, and to give them the necessary Certificates. This seems to be perfectly satisfactory to them, many of those discharged are now offering to reinlist upon having a furlough for a short time. Thus Sir has this surprizing affair been brought to a happy issue. Perhaps History does not furnish an Instance of so large a body of troops revolting from the Command of their Officers; marching in such exact order, without doing the least Injury to Individuals, and remaining in this situation for such a length of time, without divisions or confusion among themselves, and then returning to their duty as soon as their reasonable demands were complied with. This Conduct ought to convince the British how much they mistake the disposition of the Americans at large when they assert that they would willingly join them if not overawed by their tyrannic Rulers. Here was a large body composed as well of foreigners as natives having no Officer to command them and no force to prevent their joining the enemy for which they had repeated invitations, yet though they well knew they were liable to the severest punishment for their revolt they disdained the British Offers, with a firmness that would have done honor to the antient Romans and through the whole have shown the greatest respect to the Committee of Congress, to the Governor and members of the Council for the State of Pensylvania, and expressed the highest confidence in the justice of their civil Rulers and have not through the whole deviated from that  order and regularity which upon other occasions must have done honor to military discipline.  I have the honor to be with the most perfect esteem your Excellency most Obed Servt, John Sullivan  P.S. One circumstance ought not to be omitted which in my opinion does the Insurgents much honor. When they delivered up the British Emissaries Governor Reed offered them a Hundred golden Guineas which they refused saying that what they did was only a duty they owed that Country And that they neither received nor would receive any reward but the approbation of that Country for which they had so often fought and bleed.

  My dear Sir Philada Jany 15th. 1781 Your second Letter came to hand in due Season. My much esteemed Friend Mr Arthur Lee will take the Charge of this. I will say to you as I have said to my Boston Friends, who are sollicitous to know what Treatment he meets with here. The more I have conversd with him, the more I have been confirmd in a good opinion of him, and lamented the Mistakes and Prejudices of some Men & the Wickedness of others. His Enemies, I think, dare not openly attack his Reputation or Conduct. But the Whispers of envy & Malice, have some times Influence enough to prevent the Justice due to the virtuous Citizen. When this is the Case, it affords a Symptom of the Decay of publick Spirit, more threatening to the Liberties of a Commonwealth than Hosts of foreign Enemies. Monarchs have their Favorites who serve as Pimps on their honest Subjects. But Republicks should examine the Conduct of their Servants with an impartial Eye; and it discovers the Want of publick Virtue, as much, to withhold their Smiles from the wise and good as to bestow them on the wicked & unfaithful. Mr. Lee has as yet had neither Smiles nor Frowns. I am still in hopes he will meet with the Rewards which I am sure he would  JANUARY 15, 1781  have receivd if he had returnd a few years ago. He will have them when the Trustees of the Publick shall have Fortitude enough to be uninfluencd by great Names & Characters given to Men of base & depraved Minds. You will ask, when that will be. Perhaps not in this Age. But the Historian will in some future time draw forth the Proofs of his Patriotism, & unprejudicd Posterity will acknowledge that Arthur Lee has borne a great share in defending & establishing the Liberties of America. I say Posterity; for I believe that a wiser Generation will enjoy the Fruits of the Toil of Patriots & Heroes in the present Day.  My Friend, we must not suffer any thing to discourage us in this great Conflict. Let us recur to first Principles without Delay. It is our Duty, to make every proper Exertion in our respective States to revive the old patriotick Feelings among the People at large and to get the publick Departments, especially the most important of them, filled with Men of understanding & inflexible Virtue. It would be indeed alarming, if the United States should ever entrust the Ship in which our all is at Stake, with inexperienc'd or unprincipled Pilots. Our Cause is surely too interesting to Mankind, to be put under the Direction of Men, vain, avaricious or conceald under the Hypocritical Guise of Patriotism, without a Spark of publick or private Virtue. We may possibly be more in Danger of this, than many of our honest Citizens may imagine. Is there not Reason to apprehend, that even those who are inimical to our Cause may steal into Places of the highest Trust? I need not remind you that Men of this Character have had Seats in Congress from the beginning. Where is Galloway, Low, Allen & Alexander?(1) If it was so in those Times of Vigilance & Zeal, how much more is it to be expected, when the Love of many is waxin cold, & their Minds are distracted with the Pursuit of Pleasure & exorbitant Riches. We cannot be perswaded to believe that bad Men have been sent by their States with a View of giving a fatal Stab to our Cause in its Infancy; but is it unreasonable to suppose that their Elections were secretly influencd by artful Men; with this Design. Our most dangerous Enemies may be in our Bosoms.  Mr. Lee will inform you how Matters go on here. I must let you know that when your Kinsman Mr William Lee (2) was in Boston in Sept 1779 he borrowed five hundred Dollars of Moses Gill Esqr, and drew his Bill on his Brother Mr George Lee of Westmoreland County. I wish it may be paid on Sight, for it was advancd on my Application.  My Regards to Mrs. Lee &c. Adieu & believe me to be, your Friend.  ""

This day before we entred upon Business we sent for the Board of Sergeants who waited upon us and were very submissive wishing to be dissolved; it was thought best as the Regiments wou'd not receive their officers to continue the Board meerly for the Sake of some order. After Colo Craige had left us he was exceedingly insulted by some of his Regiment who presented their Firelockes And threatned to take his life, the sergeants have promised to secure the Fellows and deliver them to us-with such small arms as they tooke out of the Schooner at the Time of the Tumult last Evening.  From the Measure of this Day we find the soldiers less Tumultuous, and more in fear of us.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia 16 January 1781 I have not as yet finished my Letters for Europe which I intend troubling you with, but hope to Send them by next Post. We have for several Days been amused with Accounts of the Enemy's Landing in Virginia,(1) but yesterdays Mail brought us a confirmation, Congress have no Official Account, but many private Letters give a variety of different Accounts-the most satisfactory one I have seen is from Col. Gervais to Col Motte dated a[t] Frederickburgh the 8th Instant, the purport of which was, that Arnold commands-that he proceeded  JANUARY 16, 1781  up James River in his vess[e]ls & Landed within 15 Miles of Richmond, which Town he took possession of & remained at 24 hours, destroyed all the Public Buildings & stores he found there, collected all the Rum & Salt from the Merchants & others, threw the Salt into the River & stove the rum in the Streets. He proceeded to the Iron foundry at West Ham about miles (2) higher up the River & destroyed every thing at that place. Governor Jefferson & Baron Steuben retired to Manchester & had secured all the arms & military Stores. The Militia had collected in Small Parties & several Skirmishes had happened, but nothing of consequence. The last Accounts say the British were retiring to their Shipping & will probably land at different places in the Bay, as Plunder & Devastation seem to be their Object. Our last Accts. from Genl Green were on the l9th Decr. Nothing had happened there since the affair of Rugely's.(3) The affair of the Pensylvania Line is not finally settled, but in a proper Train. Governor Reed returned here yesterday from Trenton, & left every thing going on Right then. The Execution of the Emissaries from New York is a sure Sign they did not mean going over to the Enemy, & the refusal of the Committee of Sergeants of one hundred Guineas offered them by the Governor as a reward for the Order & regularity Observed on their March, with His Answer, that what they had done was from principle & what they conceived their Duty is much to their honour.

  Sir Philadelphia 16 Janry 1781 Your Excellency will receive a circular Letter from the President of Congress, the principal Object of which is to Obtain Pay for the JANUARY 16, 1781  Army.(1) In it also the States are requested to furnish Provisions according to the former Resolutions of Congress. The Disappointment of Pay, together with the Deficiency of the Supplies of Provision and Cloathing, accompanied with some Other unhappy Circumstances, has produced such Discontent in the Pennsylvania Line, as has finally occasioned a considerable Number of them to be discharged from the Service. Such an unhappy Event it is hoped, will not take Place with Regard to any Other Line, but We certainly Ought as speedily as possible to remove every Cause which has produced it. The Provisions for the Army are expected to be derived from the Several States according to former Requisitions. The Reason why the Cloathing has not been recd. which was to have been Sent from France, is not yet fully known, in all Probability there must have been some great Neglect in those charged with the Shipping of it. But it is Said that it may be soon expected. The Pay of the Army was expected to be made by the New Bills, and which are now most urgently called for-But shall these Bills Seasonably issue and obtain all the Credit expected from them they will probably be found Very insufficient to Defray the Expences of the next Campaign, including the large Sums Now due in Arrears, even should the usual mode of Taxation be Augmented as farr as can be reasonably expected. In this View an Application will be renewed for a foraign Loan-But the Success of this Measure to us appears too precarious to be relied upon, And indeed the Utility of the Measure We apprehend may Very justly be doubted, when We consider the Vast Resources of this Country, which might be drawn forth adequate to our Wants (except Cloathing and Military Stores which We can Obtain from Abroad) in Case our Revenue was but proportionably increased. Wheither this cannot be effected We conceive demands the most Serious Attention-And likewise to Consider wheither some Funds for the Use of the United States as such, cannot be established. The last year has given Us the most destressing Experience that there are many National Expences, which the States individually, cannot Discharge, Nor by Reason of the Uncertainty and Deficiency of the Sums paid into the continental Chest by the usual modes of Taxation, can any Confidence be placed upon their being paid. The Existince of a Power (if it can be called such) constituted for National Purposes, especially for directing the Affairs of a War, not possessing any consitutional Authority to command the Smallest Portion of Property, is scarcely conceivable. We Apprehend that over and above such Taxes as shall be collected from particular States, for general Uses, grounded upon regular Estimates, and which Taxes granted for such a Purpose ought to be Regularly paid and Strictly Appropriated, that there ought also to be a Power Vested in such as Superintend National Affairs, to raise a Revenue from such Property as cannot with Convenience nor Advantage be Subject to the Controul of any   particular State-and thereby extend the publick Credit by establishing a Revenue purely National.  We cannot Say but that Sentiments of this kind may be thot improper. But when We find Ourselves charged in our political Capacity with the Violations of Ingagments-And feel the loss of National Credit-these Sentiments Appear to us just. What has been principally talked of and expected, to obtain this End, has been a Cession to the United States of their unlocated Territory and that the States Vest Congress with exclusive Power to regulate Foraign Commerce and to lay reasonable Dutys upon Imports and Exports. This is a Measure Not yet agreed to, and We cannot Say what will be done in Regard to it.  Before We close this Letter We cannot but express our Grief that a People who generally possess the most Ardent Desires to establish their Libertys upon the fullest Conviction of their high Importance, That a Country abounding with Men and Supplies, yet from a Defect in their Constitution or Councils or both of them, should not seem to have it in their Power to call them forth with mores Advantage- And altho our past Experience has proved to us that our Exertions have been Aided by the Almighty-And that our Cause is supported by Two of the Belligerent Powers of Europe and countenanced We believe by all the Rest, except our open and professed Enemys, yet We seem to be in a Condition as if We did not possess those Advantages. This Strange Situation can hardly be otherwise Accounted for, than that the National Principles from whence Union and Force are to be derived are not properly established-And it may with equal Propriety be Said-That proper Arrangments to Ascertain and check the publick Expenditures have not yet been made-And that there is a general Defect in the Establishment of the civil executive Departments Acting immediately under Congress. These Objects are likewise in Contemplation and may possibly be put upon a more Advantagious footing.  We have No Intilligence to communicate to your Excellency but what you will find in the publick Papers. We are with every Sentiment of Esteem, Your Excellency's Most Obedient, humble Servant,  Oliver Wolcott Jesse Root ""

  Dear Sir Philadelphia, January 16th, 1781. I have no doubt but that you have had an account of the Mutiny which has lately happened in the Pensylvania line, We were at first under great Apprehensions that their Designs were to go over and Joyn the Enemy, and that they had given other Reasons as Austensible merely to Cover their Real Design. But they have given Convinceing proofs that their only aim was a Redress of Grievances, for General Clinton from New York Sent out two persons among them while they were at princetown, with proposals and Invitation to come over to him, the terms which he Offered were very plausible, and Generous, and was Sufficient to try the Virtue of Troops who had Suffered much less than ours. But after Reading them to the line at large, they Rejected them with indignation, Siezed the Spies who brought them, and Delivered them over to General Wane to be Dealt with as Should be proper, and who last week had an Enquiery on them and Executed them. I have not learned their names tho one we understand was a Sergeant in the New Levies.  Congress Sent a Committee with President Reed to hear their Complaints, and to Redress their Real Grievances which I am happy to inform you they have Effected to the Satisfaction of the Soldiers who have Recd their Officers and Returned to their Duty.  By what I can understand the principle Reason that gave Rise to the mutiny was that many Soldiers of that line, who were Inlisted for three years or During the war, were Detained in Service after they had Served three Years, which they Considered as unjust, not Doubting but that they ought to be discharged at the end of either period which Should first happen. The Exact terms upon [whtch] they have Settled the matter I am not able to give you but one of them is that all those who were held under the above Circumstances are now Discharged. But I understand that This State has Collected a Sum of hard money which the president has on the Spot, and that for a Small Bounty in Specie many of them have Reinlisted.  By a Number of Letters Recd. Yesterday (tho' not Official) General Arnold has Arrived in Virginia with the Troops which went from New York under his Command. He Sailed as far up James River as he Could, landed Suddenly and march 23 miles to Richmond, the Seat of Goverment in that State, and Where there had been Collected a Considerable Quantity of publick Stores. The Inhabitants Removed as many as they Could upon the Short notice they had, the Remainder were Destroyed with all the publick Buildings at that place and a General plundering of the Inhabitants took place-their beginning their Retreat is the last we heard of them. Whether they will Effect or not is uncertain, as We hear the Militia were Collecting  JANUARY 16, 1781  very fast below them, I am in hopes the Virginians will Exert themselves on this occasion and Catch that Scoundrel Arnold.  Congress are Endeavouring to Devise Some mode to pay for the flour Seised by Virtue of your Excellencys warrant for that purpose to our State agent, and Communicated to Congress by General Washington. However desireous they may be to make Compensation for the provisions thus Obtained Yet they are put to Difficulties to know from whence the money can be obtained for that purpose.(1) By the Circular Letter from Congress which you will Receive about the time youl Receive this,(2) your Excellency will Discover the Embarrass Circumstances of America-and it is to be hoped that the Delinquent States when they See the Danger which awaits them and the Continent in General, by Reason of their neglect or inattention, that they will be Induced to Exertions beyond what they have Yet made.

  Dear Sir Philada. Jany. 16th: 1781 I was very glad at not being disappointed in my expectations of a favor from you by yesterday's post.(1) Several reports in quick  JANUARY 16, 1781  succession of the arrival & progress of the predatory band under Arnold had rendered us exceedingly anxious to hear the truth & particulars of the matter. Some letters by the post tell us that the Governor with Baron Steuben was wholly engaged in removing & securing the arms & ammunition. If so he was better employed than in writing to Congress on the subject, which from his usual punctuality was expected. The enterprize against Richmond at this season was certainly an audacious one, and strongly marks the character which directed it. Having been long sensible that the security of the Country as high up as tide water reaches has been owing more to the ignorance & caution of the enemy than to its own strength or inaccessibleness, I was much less astonished at the news than many others. To those who are strangers to the sparse manner in which that Country is settled & the easy penetration afforded by its long navigable rivers, the rapid and unopposed advances of the Enemy appear unaccountable & our national character suffers imputations which are by no means due to it.  Congress have yet received no official report of the result of the conciliatory measures taken with the revolted Soldiers at Trenton. From oral & circumstantial evidence There is no doubt that they have been successful. A discharge of a part from the service & a supply of cloathing & money to the rest is the price of their submission. This much considered in itself was required by justice & is consequently consistent with dignity. But considered with respect to the circumstances attending the negotiation, there is but too much ground to suspect that it will be attributed to our fears, & is therefore not a little mortifying. Happily the example, as we understand by a letter from Genl Washington recd. yesterday had not infected the other parts of the Army. As the same causes however which engendered this malignant humour in the Pennsylvania line are known to exist in the other lines, we cannot be sure that the same effects will not yet take place in the latter unless they be speedily removed. As one step towards it Congress are endeavoring to profit of the Alarm which this event must have excited in the States by calling upon them for the means of immediately furnishing some pay to the troops of their respective lines.  You ask me what I think of the Delegate Extraordinary to Congress?(2) I wish you had told me what you think of such an appointment. It is pretty certain I believe that people in general will not consider it as a proof of confidence in the ordinary Delegation. As Mr. Jones who I believe possesses the confidence of his Country & I am sure will have as much weight in Congress as any man that will be sent on such an occasion, will come about the same [time], & having attended the Legislature will be as well informed in every point of view I can not deny that the appointment appears to me to be at least a supernumerary one. I wish the good effects of it may shew that I am mistaken.  The trade of this City has just suffered a very severe blow. No less than seven fine Vessels have been taken out of an Outward bound fleet & carried into N. York.  I am Dr. Sir Yrs. very sincerely, James Madison Junr.

  Sir Philadelphia Jany. 16th. 1781 A particular knowledge of the State of the country which we have the honor to represent in Congress, being so necessary for enabling you to give a just Idea of the situation of the affairs of the united States to his most Christian Majesty and his Ministers, and your own attention having been so much engaged in the business of the field, as probably to have prevented your attending to the acquiring of such knowledge, we presume our Ideas will not be entirely useless and therefore we offer them to you.(1) North Carolina, which once afforded great abundance of provisions for its own inhabitants and a considerable quantity for exportation, has, by natural casualties and the events of the war, been reduced so as to afford but a scanty supply for the inhabitants.  The events of the war have occasioned embargoes and great difficulty of exporting bulky articles, such as provisions and consequently lessened the demand; the objects of agriculture soon were confined to the support of the husbandman and his family and very little surplus was produced. Considerable drafts of the husbandmen were frequently made to oppose the Indian and British enemy who attacked the States of South Carolina and Georgia, and this also very much deranged the agriculture of the country. For near twelve months past the western country has been the theatre of the most wasteful ravage committed reciprocally by irregular bands of Whigs & Tories-by troops who were very ill supplied-by the enemy under Ferguson before the defeat at Kings Mountain and by those under Lord Cornwallis before his retreat from Charlotte.  Natural casualties have been peculiarly unfavourable. One year the crops very generally failed on the upland through extreme drought and the low lands on the rivers, which are in general exceedingly  JANUARY 16, 1781  fertile and productive were wasted by innundations which were the effect of heavy rains that succeeded the long drought. The next year a blast destroyed the wheat so generally that it became difficult to procure seed for a very small proportion of the grounds which were usually cultivated for that grain, so that the succeeding crops, tho very good, were very small in quantity. The last season was happy in affording fine crops of every thing and had not the derangements before mentioned circumscribed agriculture in general and its product near the seat of the war, provisions could be had in great plenty for a considerable army. What remains in the western part of the country must be brought very slowly and with great difficulty to the magazines from which the troops are to be supplied, because the constant waste of carriages and draught cattle had made transportation extremely difficult. The lower part of the country which is not exhausted and would furnish a good quantity of provisions, is so remote from the scene of war in the back country that in our present circumstances no aid can be derived from it by land transportation.  The resources of Virginia are very plentiful but are also at too great a distance to be relied on for extensive operations. Thus Sir, you see we are in a very ill condition to oppose an enemy who can convey their supplies up the rivers of South Carolina near to the [scene of] action, while ours are at a prodigious distance widely scattered, capable of transportation only by land, and the means of that transportation extremely difficult.  From this view you will clearly perceive how important an object it is to attack the enemy on the sea coast in such force as to oblige them to withdraw their troops from the interior country and this under the auspicies of a naval superiority. The scene of war would then be removed to a country where positions could be taken with advantage and supplies furnished in abundance through the navigable rivers, bays and sounds of Virginia, North and South Carolina.  With the highest consideration, we have the honor to be, Sir, Your Most Obedient and most humble Servants,  Tho Burke  Wm. Sharpe Sam Johnston ""

  Sir,(1) Philadelpa. 16 Janry 1781 The unhappy Disturbance in the Pensylvania Line is quieted. Many of them are Discharged especially Such as claimed to be dismissed as they had inlisted for three years or during the War. This Ambiguous Inlistment has been the Occasion of much Dificulty- besides this the State hired Men lately at the Incampment of the Line to Inlist during the War by a Bounty of Nine pounds in Spice [Specie]. These Circumstances Attending such as have been common to the Other Lines, Viz, the Want of Pay and proper supplies, seems to have been the principal Causes of the late Disturbance. The Line discovered their Abhorrence of entering into the British Service by their rejecting Very Alluring offers and by their delivering up to be executed the Emissarys Sent out by the British Commander to Seduce them from their Allegiance.  Every Principle of Justice as well as Prudence dictate the Necessity  JANUARY 17, 1781  of paying the Army-And Congress have called again upon the States to enable them to Effect it, To Pay and Provide for the Army ought certainly to be the primary Objects in every deliberative Council.

The general State of Affairs in Carolina and Georgia seems to be that the Enemy are excercising the greatest Severity upon the Inhabitants-And that the People especially in the Northern parts of those States are taking every Oppertunity in which they are frequently Successful to repel the Violence.  We have No Very late Intelligence from Europe.  The New Money of this State is but just coming out-so that it cannot yet be Said, what will be the Degree of Credit which it will Obtain-But it will soon be in Circulation. Wheather the Tender Act of this State will Accelerate this Circulation, cannot now be Assertained.  I receive No Letters from Litchfield-wheather the Want of Oppertunity to Write-or the Apprehension of Letters Miscarrying prevents My having them I cannot say. Altho I think that Letters will come by the Post with tolerable Safety. My best Compliments to Mrs. Reeve who I hope enjoys better Health. I am Sir, with much Regard, your Most Obed. Servt.

  My dear Sir Philad. Jany 17. 1781 Your favor of the 17th of Novr was duly receivd. It bodes very ill to Government when Men are exalted to places of high trust through their own Sollicitations. He only fills a place with Dignity, who is invited to it by his Fellow Citizens, from the Experience they have had of his adequate Abilities, & who does the Duties of it with Zeal & Fidelity. Such a Man, being conscious that neither Smiles, Intreaties, Gifts, Intrigue nor any dishonorable Practices have procured him his high Station, may rely on the People who gave him their free Suffrages, to approve of his honest Endeavors to serve them. And having Nothing in View but that the Publick may be best servd, he will chearfully resign his Place whenever the People shall make Choice of another whom they judge more capable than he. JANUARY 17, 1781  The People are certainly the best Judges, who are most likely to render them substantial Service; & whoever interposes in their Elections, with his own Sollicitations for himself, it is to be feard, if he is of any Consequence, will in time become a dangerous Party Man. He ought therefore to be despisd as an obtruder. I hope there are not many such Men in our Government. I am sorry to be informd that there are any.

Alas! I am still unable. But I could not refrain from expressing to you by this Opportunity how much I am affected with Pleasure by any Occurrence which redounds to your Glory. The Governor of Virginia mentions very honorably your Conduct with a small Body of militia of which you had condescended to take the Command while a traiterous Villain was aiming to make extensive Ravage on James River in that State. Your own Letters to Congress' have confirmed the Propriety of the Governors grateful Sentiments. I Would to God you were at the Head of a Body suitably equipped to execute the Directions which your great military Knowledge enables you to give whenever you are in a Field of Action. I regret much the Mortifications which I know your warm Zeal in our Cause must have met with, from your Inequality of Men, Artillery, and, in Short, every Means of giving a final Blow to Arnold's Schemes.  I regret more that you have no Prospect but of the Continuance of such Disadvantages. The Chapter of Contingencies has heretofore been greatly in our Favor. We ought wisely and Seasonably to avoid being betrayed into a Dependence on that alone. Some time Since the Beginning of this year we finished an Application to France which you was earnest for months ago.  Genl. McDugal took a Seat in Congress last Week.

Waynes Quarters with Intelligence that the Line of Jersey have followed exactly the Footsteps of the Pennsylvanians.(2)  A number of them have left (he says) their Hutts, and taken post at Chatham a strong Situation in the Gorge of the Mountain, this Step may be attended with very serious Consequences unless something can be immediately done to prevent them.  We have after great difficulties settled with all the Penna. Line except three Regiments: shou'd Emissaries be sent by the Jersey Troops to those Regiments with an Invitation to join them at Chatham, knowing their Discontents, and they effect it, it wou'd add greatly to their Strength and consequently their Presumption.  Genl. Wayne is now with us to know if something cou'd not be done in conjunction with him to prevent if possible the ill conseqeunces that must ensue shou'd the remainder of the Pennsylvanians accept the Invitation.  If the Troops at Trenton cou'd be prevaild upon to march under their Officers to suppress the present Mutiny it wou'd be fortunate, this probably might be effected if Congress wou'd engage to those Troops who shall remain for the War, and act upon this occasion the same Bounty that is giving by the State to Recruits.  The great occasion of their present discontent and uneasiness is that they have bourne the fatigue of the day for a small Bounty whilst others who shall be now recruited will receive the large Bounty now offerd by the State.

  Dear Sir Philada. Jany 23d. 1781 I have nothing new this week for you but two reports: the first is that very great discontents prevail in N. York among the German Troops for causes pretty similar to those which produced the eruption in the Pennsylvania line. It is further said on this head that a party of 200 have deserted from Long Island & gone to Rhode Island. The other report is that the British Minister either has or proposes to carry a bill into Parliamt. authorising the Commanding officer in America to permit & promote a trade with us in British Goods of every kind except Linens & Woolens. This change of system is said to be the advice of some notable refugees, with a view to revive an intercourse as far as possible between the two Countries, & particularly to check the habit that is taking place in the consumption of French Manufactures. Whatever their public views may be it is certain that such a plan would open fine prospects to them in a private view. JANUARY 23, 1781  We have recd. no fresh or certain information of the designs of F. and Spain in assembling so great a force at Cadiz. There does not appear to be any object in that Quarter except Gibralter. Should the attempts be renewed agst. that place, it will prove that the former has not that absolute sway in the Cabinet of the latter which has been generally imagined. Nothing could have prevailed on the French to recall their fleet from the Islands at the time they did but the necessity of humouring Spain on the subject of her hobby horse.  I am glad to hear that Arnold has been at last fired at. It sounded a little unfavorably for us in the ears of people here that he was likely to get off without that proof of a hostile reception. If he ventures an irruption in any other quarter I hope he will be made sensible that his impunity on James River was owing to the suddeness of his appearance & not to the want of spirit in the people.

  Sr. Philadelphia Jany 23d. 1781 It is with much concern that we have learnt from Your Excellencys and the Baron de Steubens letters to Congress, (1) the Misfortunes our Country has sufferd from the Invasion under the command of the detestable Arnold, and that he has ventured with impunity even to our Capitol. We have some reason to Imagine that the same plan of operations which induced Clinton to send him there will occasion him to remain in our Bay and continue that alarm to our state and Maryland which he has so successfully begun in order to Harrass our Militia, encrease our expences, waste our resources destroy our Magazines and Stores when he finds it practicable, and by thus distracting us prevent our sending the necessary Succours to the Southern Army. This Sr. is a game we are open to at every period of our short enlistments, and in a great measure exposed to for want of a Militia organized to take the field, a few Gun boats or Galleys, and some good fortifications in the most advantageous Situations on our Rivers for defence, but this late event has renderd this so obvious, that we are fully persuaded our Country will now see the necessity of adopting arrangements very different from what have been of late trusted to. We have been anxiously expecting to hear that some steps were taken at Rhode Island in Consequence of our application to the Minister (2)-but it is more probable you will hear before we do. Shd. that event take place, which we have spared no pains to have accomplished; and of this we have little doubt shd.  JANUARY 24, 1781  it be found practicable; Nothing new has happend here since we last wrote .  The Judge of the Admiralty of this State has given us notice that there are three Negroes Tom, Hester & Celia confined in Goal here in consequence of a condemnation of the Vessel in which they were taken. They say they are the property of a certain Money Godwin of Norfolk in Virginia, that their Master went off with the British fleet under Leslie and gave them permission to do the same, on which they went on board the Vessel in which they were taken.

  Dr. Tucker Philadelphia Jany. 26th 1781 A Rheumatic Pain in the Shoulder which has kept me two days confined does in the Intervalls of Ease give me an opportunity of writing to you. I find it difficult in the Compass of a letter to give you an Answer to your Complicated Question concerning loan office Certificates tho I clearly understand your meaning-but shall endeavor to Satisfy you on that head as breifly as possible, but will first premise that I have not the scale of depreciation by me (altho it has been Publishd) (1) nor am I able to procure it in time [to] send by this oppy.-you shall have it as soon as I can get it. It is the Intention of Congress, to pay the Just value, both of Principal & Interest to all lenders of money, and (if the states will enable them) to establish permanent funds for so doing-you must at the first view see that it wd. be impracticable to adjust a scale of depreciation that wd. apply throughout the Continent, by the Price of any one article e.g. Tobo. at a given time-all that can be done is to have reference to a Universal standard and to make a liberal allowance in the  JANUARY 26, 1781  adjustment of what has been lent; to establish funds for the Payment of the Interest and reduction of the Principal by dividends as soon as possible. The Standard heretofore adopted has been I believe the Precious metals and their Value regulated by the exchanges. Shd. Commodities or produce of any kind be admitted-their daily fluctuation and liability to be speculated on would open a Species of fraud & Speculation which the al[ert] financier could not possibly stop, and a Torrent of depreciation which would overwhelm every thing. The Supposed depreciation of the new money is owing to the Qy. of the old still remaining in Circulation, together with the State Emissions-& the Loan office Certificates-when the first two are calld in and the last funded-that can no longer be the case but in proportion to its being more than a necessary medium of trade-or its want of funds to rest on-the first of these will not I think be the case-and if the states do their duty the latter cannot Happen. The Present cause of depreciation is therefore a momentary one, and will cease as soon as those steps are taken which Congress is about recommending.(2) Your reasoning is plausibly Just if applied to Virginia alone-but if you will take a more extenssive and general View of the Subject you will easily perceive how the public wd. be injured by makeing the Price of Tobo. at the time of the loan a Standard of depreciation, for the whole continent. From what I have said which is all that I can yet say with propriety on this intricate Subject-you may perceive the Ground you stand upon. I must repeat it-that it is the firm Intention of Congress to do strict Justice to the Holders and the Community at large, if the states will Enable them by granting them funds irrevocable, untill the debts contracted for carrying on the war are paid-by paying them solid interest in specie finally to the full amount, and Sinking by dividends untill the whole is Sunke the original real value of the loans all Speculative depreciation of the new money will be considerd as I apprehend in payments and carryed to the Credit of Principal & Interest, but no further emissions will be made to make it good (which would be only adding fuel to fire.) & by this means the Paper medium will fund its own balance, and the redemption continually going on, will in a few years be all absorbed.  Altho in Pain-I cannot put down my pen without Congratulating you and my Sister on the birth of a son, I suppose [named] St. George. I hope she is well recoverd, and if I was in a Poetical instead of a Rheumatical Vein I shd. surely write a Birthday ode or compose an Hymn to the young St. I suppose you are busy in writing a Sanctipaedia.  Tell Fannie that I will no longer Put up with her Slight-and that even her Nursery shall be no excuse for neglecting me any longer. For half of every letter I write to you is intended for her, so she cannot say I have never wrote to her.  I am extreemely Sorry Mr Ozborne has de[clined] or rather talks of declining the business-he is [a] valuable man & I think shd. not be lost if it [can] at a small expence be avoided-but if he cannot be retaind-I could wish you and my Father and Mr. Randolph would fix on a proper person to fill his place. It requires some caution and much circumspection in the Choice. If Mr. Woodson will do I have no objection tho I think it wd. not be amiss to have Mr. Ozborne as a Privy Councellor. His abilities & integrity I think may be relied on. God Bless you both I must conclude this. Cursed pain tugs me by the Shoulder.  Adieu & may you never feel it is the sincere wish of Yr. affectt.

  Dear Sir Philadelphia Jany 27th 1781  As you have had the Politeness to undertake in the affair between Mr Burk & myself it becomes my Duty to acquaint you with the Facts.(1) I am Convinced you would never Espouse the Cause of any Man who had been guilty of ungentlemanly Conduct or Condemn one who has not willingly Transgressed by a wanton Departure from the Rules of Propriety. As it is imposible to know how this Dispute may Terminate: a Desire to vindicate my own reputation; and to Enable you Clearly to Decide upon the Justice, & Propriety, of the Part you have been polite Enough to undertake: I take the Liberty of Laying before you the following State of Facts.  A few Days after the Battle of Brandiwyne I received a Letter from a member of Congress in these words,(2) \""I find Some of the Southern members are Determined to ruin your reputation, one of them has accused you of the most Shameful Conduct at the Battle of Brandiwyne in which action he pretends to have had a Considerable hand & asserts that he assisted to rally your broken Troops which you had not Sufficient Skill to do yourself & that to your ill Arangement, bad Disposition of your Troops & misconduct the Loss of the Battle Ought to be attributed: Congress have in Consequence Suspended you from the Service. \"" As no name was mentioned I was totally at a Loss to Guess the Person. I was rather Led to believe JANUARY 27, 1781  Portrait of Alexander McDougall  it was Either Mr Penn or Mr Smith, the former of which I know corresponded with Major Taylor who was my accuser in the affair of Staten Island. With how much Justice this accusation was made you who have Sat in Judgment upon the affair can Easily Determine.(3) I had been informed that Mr Penn was warm in Supporting that Accusation against me In Congress. I was Informed that both Mr Penn & Mr Smith were members of Congress & that Mr Smith was a near relation of Lieut Colo Smith who was an assistant to Major Taylor in the affair of Staten Island. I had been Informed that they were both in the Action of Brandywine. I was therefore Led to believe it was one of those Gentlemen but could [not] Determine with Certainty. I recollected to have Seen Several Gentlemen on Horseback riding in a field where General Washington was near a mile & a half from the Place of Action. I Supposed them volunteers but was Informed that there were among them Some members of Congress but who I did not then inquire, my Letter therefore of the 6th of October (4) was Like Drawing a Bow at a venture & had Mr Burk Sent to Inquire whether I meant to Censure him for any thing he had Said against me in Congress I Should have replyed that I never once heard that he had Mentioned my name. He was the first Person that gave me the Information by Letters in which you will find that he not only Tells me what he had Said in Congress but makes a number of assertions founded in mistake. So far then as respected Mr Burks Declarations in Congress it became my Duty to remove Every impression it had made & in my Letter to Congress Inclosing the written Declarations of General Washington & others I considered Mr Burk as a member of that Body & I think Treated him with Decency but in his Letter written to me wherein he undertakes to Accuse me to myself & Threatens to call me to Account as a Gentleman & Demands an Explanation of my Letter; I by no means Considered him as a member of Congress but as a Private Gentleman & as Such replied to his assertions made to myself, after which I considered all our Correspondence as between two private Gentlemen & that he had Either by Accident or Design Deprived himself of the Robes of Authority. I am not Clearly convinced that a member of Congress has a right to Take what Liberties he thinks proper with the Character of an officer and I think I can never be brought to believe that he can have a Priviledge of writing to any Gentleman Accusing him of want of Capacity & Every thing that would make him contemptible in the Eyes of the world & the other be Barred from replying with Spirit becase his Accuser was a member of Congress. I therefore considered myself at full Liberty at Least to return Acrimony for Acrimony. I am not possessed of the Correspondence, But I understand Mr Burk has all but my Last Letter from Rhode Island about which we Shall have no Difficulty as the words Said to be Exceptionable are (6) \""The Several assertions in your Letter are as far from Truth as I Deem   the assertor to be from a Gentleman of Honor or Candor. \"" These words or Some others of the Same purport were undoubtedly used. But then it was in return to a Letterfull of Invectives against me repeating the Charges which were first urged by him against me. I knew that Mr Burk had Seen the written Declaration of the principal officers who were with me in the Battle of Brandiwine in which they Declare me not Guilty of the Blunders, the want of presence of mind &c of which he had Accused me, as also the Declaration of the Maryland Officers That they had the utmost Confidence in Me & the Declarations of the Commander in Chief Acquitting me of any kind of Neglect & Declaring that though the falsity of the Intelligence Transmitted through me proved unfortunate yet he Should have Deemed me Culpable if I had withheld it. I at the Same time had been Informed previous to the receipt of this Letter That Mr Burk had through the Influence of Major Taylor been violently against me in the affair of Staten Island. I could not therefore As I was unacquainted with Mr Burk but by writing Avoid Supposing that he Shew a great want of Candor in refusing to alter his opinion upon the Evidence Sent to Congress & of Honor in not acknowledging the Error. Perhaps if I had had the pleasure of being personally Acquainted with Mr Burk I might have Supposed his Conduct to have proceeded from an unbounded zeal in the Cause of his Country & the too great Credence he gave to persons in whom he then thought he might Confide but under the then Circumstances I could not Surely form any favorable opinion of him. Besides I Supposed myself at as full Liberty to give Mr Burk my opinion of him as he had to give his opinion of me to myself in a Letter to which mine was only an answer & further I conceived and yet do, that if any Gentleman writes me a Letter full of invectives I have a Right to return a Language of the same kind, in vindication of myself without Examining Strictly into the Truth of the assertions provided his assertions are unjust for he is in that Case the first aggressor. In Support of this opinion unless I Should be convinced of Error, I am ready to make the Last appeal. I would never wish it to be believed in any Event, that I appealed to Arms to Try the Issue, whether Mr Burk was not a man of Honor, Candor or Integrity but to vindicate my right to retaliate when I am first attacked without Cause. Thus Sir have I given you a faithful narrative of the whole Transaction which you will find fully Supported by the papers. This will Enable you whatever may be the Issue of this Dispute to vindicate my reputation &Justify the friendly part you have politely agreed to take.  I have the Honor to be very respectfully, Dr Sir, your most obedient Servt, Jno Sullivan  ""

  My dear General, Philadelphia 29th January 1781 I had the Honour of writing to you last by our Friend the Marquiss de la fayette intending before this to have followed it by some Information on the Subject of cloathing for the army. I have taken pains to investigate it fully and you have the best Right to the fruites of my Enquiry: It does not appear that there has been any Inattention in the Body of Congress to this essential Article: that there have been faults and probably frauds in the Execution of their orders is too Justly to be apprehended: but the principal disappointment is to be ascribed to a series of real misfortunes. I have not time to enter into a detail of Facts. If the publick business shoud permit I still propose to undertake the Task; if not it shall be reserved for a personal Interview. It will not, I flatter myself, be long before I enjoy that Satisfaction. There are some political Regulations of great Importance which I have exceedingly at heart and which are now drawn near to a Conclusion. My Anxiety to see them finished delays my Journey which General McDougald's presence here renders practicable. The principal measures to which I allude are the Establishment of Executives or Ministers in the departments of Finance, War, the Marine and foreign Affairs; the accomplishment of the Confederation; the procuring to Congress an augmentation of power and permanent Revenues for carrying on the War.  The day is at length arrived when dangers and distresses have opened the Eyes of the People and they perceive the Want of a common head to draw forth in some Just proportion the Resources of the several Branches of the federal Union. They perceive that the deliberative power exercised by States individually over the Acts of Congress must terminate in the common Ruin; and the Legislature, however reluctantly, must resign a portion of their Authority to the National Representative, or cease to be Legislatures.  The Sufferings and the discontents of the Army, in the mean time, gives us infinite disquiet. Woud to God it was in our power to provide an instant and adequate Remedy! but this as your Excellency will observe by our late address must depend on the Exertions of the JANUARY 29, 1781  States. The Insurrection of the Pensylvania line, however deeply to be regretted, was accompanied by Circumstances which afford some Consolation. The Enemy at New York on receiving the Information were elated beyond all bounds and gave way to the most extravagant Expectations: but when they learned that the Spies were executed, they were sunk into dejection; and sullen Silence succeeded their short lived Triumph! This Information we have by a young man who left that City a week ago. It was with Singular pleasure that we observed your Excellency's Resolution to remain at West point which entirely corresponded with the opinion and the wishes of Congress. The weighty reasons which inclined you to that determination were presupposed: but the hazarding your Authority among a Soldiery who had suffered real grievances, and were enflamed by Incendiaries, woud alone have been decisive at least untill every other means had proved ineffectual.  You will be pleased to hear that our worthy friend Mr Jones of Virginia has resumed his Seat in Congress. That State has relinquished for the common benefit All her Claim to the Westward of the Ohio,(1) and Maryland has acceeded to the Confederation: At least I have read the Act or Resolution of their House of Delegates to that purpose only seven members being in the Negative; and Mr Jones was assured from good Authority that the Senate had concurred.2 These are Events of infinite Importance and will put a new Face on our Affairs at Home but much more so abroad. They will refute the misrepresentations of our Enemies, and convince our Friends of our perseverance and fixed Resolution to maintain our Liberties at every Hazard. The large Cessions of Territory for the use of the federal Union which will be yielded by the respective States must with wise management lay a foundation for reestablishing publick Credit. This Subject, as it ought, employs our unremitted attention, and it is become practicable to introduce System & Aconmy since the national debt and the Expenditures of the War can be viewed on a specie Scale. The fluctuation of our paper money beggard All calculation-defeated all Estimate. I have endeavoured to make myself Master of this intricate Business. We can now form a Judgement of what we owe, and what we want, and it is my opinion that if we can draw from the States a solid and permanent Fund which will produce 2,000,000, Specie dollars annually to be appropriated to the payment of Interest on the debts we owe and ten millions of Dollars which we propose to borrow. If the States will contribute in equitable proportions their internal Resources: and there is OEconomy in the Expenditures: We may hope with the aids granted by our Ally, and expected from Spain and Holland, to carry on the War more effectually. But before these measures can operate such is the Emergency of our Affairs that on a punctual Compliance with the Requisitions from the States the very Existence of the Army   depends; and we feel with the utmost Concern the distresses which their backwardness occasions. But let us quit this painful Topic and devote this day to Joy and Congratulation since by the Accomplishment of our federal Union we are become A Nation. In a political View it is of more real Importance than a Victory over all our Enemies. We shall not fail of taking advantage of the favorable Temper of the States and recommending for ratification such additional Articles as will give vigour and Authority to Government.  Be pleased to present my most respectul Complements to Mrs. Washington and the Gentlemen of the Family; and to believe that your Glory and your Happiness are among the Objects nearest to my Heart; for I am with the warmest affection, Esteem and Attachment, my dear General, Your Excellency's most Obedient and most humble Servant, Jas. Duane  P.S. I refer you for the Southern News to the enclosd Gazette. Arnold has retreated by Smithfield by Land to Portsmouth and plunderd without remorse. Our Friend Col. Harrison has been a principal sufferer. The Militia are assembling in great Force to take Vengeance of the Banditti. You will be pleased that Col. Washington has had an opportunity of distinguishing himself in Carolina. It is said that General Ohara is arrivd at Charles Town with only 370 of the Guards and that Leslie is gone with the rest of that Detachment to Augustine.  Mr Jones and Mr Maddison entreat you to accept their respectful Compliments .  ""

  Dear Sir Jan. 23d [29?] 1781.(1) You will have found, on seeing Mr. Gerry that I endeavor to economize. I told him that \""Mr. Dana had a Commission\"" for Russia, and I referred him to my \""Scrawl to you\"" for other Points.(2) Maryland confederates, Virginia seems to give away Something for the good of the Union and recommends to others to do the like.(3) I will aim to get the Act long enough to find Time to copy it, if Mr. Otis does not leave this City today. The Comtee of April 10th, 80 on Depreciation for the Staff was filled up Jany. 5th. 81 and the Instructions to the Delegates of Mass. were referred.(4) Money is JANUARY 29, 1781  exeedingly scarce here yet Exchange is from 100 to 115 old for Silver. Loaf Sugar 2s 6 or 36 dollars pr. lb. I pay 200 for Stockings and the same for Shoes. Compulsion is urged as a congressional measure by Jersey & Pensylva. but I think we are become too wise. Things appear to Mr. J. Adams Oct. 24 to indicate a malignant Continuance of War on the Part of Britain.(5)  I should have mentioned that Maryland has limited the Time beyond which she will not receive the old money. I wish I could purchase up all your new. It will most assuredly be high in Credit soon, tho' it seemed a little while ago as if the other States meant not to act in concert upon the Plan of the 18 of March.  We are determined it shall have its Chance of Success; We, mighty Men, totally dependent upon 13 Legislatures different in Views, for Support in our smallest Endeavors to carry on the War. Indeed, my dear Sir, we are in a Condition as to payment of our Debts that is most tormenting. All our Creditors must loan to us, and I suppose most of them would willingly do it if they saw their interest certain against the due Day. I wish you wd. tell me upon what Resolve it is that our Court have acted in Regard to advances to Allen the Indian Agent. I can only find Jany. 8 and May 13 1777 which my Colleagues say is not what they have supposed to be at all.(6) I will continue my Search. Mr. Gerry had a memorandm. of the secret Resolves of all the years. We have some cold Weather at last, but it is more wholesome than the past wet warm Season. I hope you have Health. I wish you that & every Happiness. Affectionately J. L.  MS not found; reprinted from Essex Institute Historical Collections 13 (July 1876): 225-26. Endorsed: \""Mr. Lovell's letter Jany. 23d. 1781.\""  (1) Although this letter was printed under the date January 23, Lovell probably wrote it on January 29 or shortly thereafter. Three subjects mentioned in the letter- Maryland's decision to ratify the Articles of Confederation, Virginia's cession of western lands, and a letter from John Adams-came before Congress on the 29th. And Lovell concludes with a comment on the arrival of \""cold\"" weather, which contrasts with the observation found in James Varnum's January 29 letter to William Greene, below, that \""The Weather is very mild; We have had no Snow or Frost of any Consequence since my Arrival.\""  (2) See Lovell to Elbridge Gerry, December 19, 1780.

  Sir, Philadelphia Jany 29th. 1781 I am honoured with the receipt of your favor of the 18 inst. covering a letter for Mr. Jay, & another for Mr. Pen. The first I have delivered to the President of Congress, to be sent with his dispatches by Collo. Armand, who sets of in a few days for France, from whence he will forward it by the first safe opporty. The other I have given in charge to Mr. Shape one of the North Carolina delegates, who has undertaken to forward it to Mr. Pen. If at any time, I can be of service to you-sir I hope you will without the least reserve command me as I shall always esteem such an employmt. an honor confered on me.  I most earnestly wish, my dr. sir, I had it in my power to communicate to you any intelligence, that would have the effect you desire, but I am afraid if you rely much on good news to beguile the tedious hours of your present solitary situation, it will require all your philosophy to guard you against the consequences of disappointment; for our affairs at this time wear an aspect by no means pleasing, nor can I view even at a distance any prognostic of it's brightening.  Congress have been for the last ten days seriously, & industriously engaged in ways & means, for establishing a permanent fund on which they might be enabled to build a future credit. (1) It seems past contracts is here a secondary consideration-perhaps you may say, a previous and equitable adjustment of this point, would have been as substantial a foundation, on which to build a credit, as any that could have been devised-this problem I leave for wiser heads than mine to solve. However, after the most mature consideration, Congress have agreed to call on the states, to grant to the United States, a duty of four Per Cent to commence on the first day of May next, on all foreign commodities imported into the states, to be estimated on the vendible price within the states respectively. Also, a like duty on the sale of all prize goods. And one eighth of a dollar per ton on all shipping from foreign ports. This impost to continue untill the debts already contracted, or that may be hereafter contracted by the United States shall be finally discharged. Thus far we have proceeded. But alas! what does all this amount to? It is computed to produce about 6 or 700,000 dollars specie per annum, when the interest alone, of the debt already contracted amounts to 2,000,000 of dollars annually. Thus you will see sir, a great deal remains to be done. As we proceed JANUARY 29, 1781  with this subject I will take the liberty from time to time of informing you of our determinations. In the mean time, what I have already mentioned may serve to fill up some of your vacant hours, to contimplate on. The policy or impolicy of the plan, is a matter of no small moment.  In a letter lately received by Congress from Mr. Dumas (a private Agent imployed by them in Holland) he says, The British Minister at the court of Petersburgh, has offered on the part of his Master to accede to the northern Convention, provided the United Provinces were excluded. This has alarmed their High Mightinesses not a little. And I fancy will induce an immediate recession in their demands of a guarantee of their East India possessions. The blundering policy of the British Ministry for the last five or six years, must open a most fertile field for a commentary by the historian of those days. Had they studied 'till dooms day for a mode to strengthen the northern league, they could not have devised a more effectual one; for this brings Holland immediately into an accession, which has been the only thing hitherto wanted, to compleat that formidable confederacy.  Be pleased to make my compliment to Mrs. Livingston, & the young ladies.  I have the honor to be with the highest respect & regard, Yr. Excys. most Obedt. Servt. Jno. Mathews  P.S. Maryland have at length agreed to Confederate. This may be relyed on.  ""

  Please your Excellency Philadelphia. Jany. 29th 1781 Virginia has Ceded to the united States a large territory of Country lying Northwest of the Ohio, Extracts of which I enclose to you.(1) Maryland we are very Credibly Informed has acceded to the Confederation tho' no official accounts have yet arrived.(2)  By a letter received this day from Mr John Adams Dated in Octr.(3) we have reason to beleive that as the king of great Britain has got a Minister & parliament more to his mind we may lay aside thoughts of peace & prepare for war-for it is his Opinion that great Britain will never acknowledge our Independance as long as there is a british Soldier in our Country nor even till long after. He writes that there  JANUARY 29, 1781  is Some prospect of a rupture between the united Provinces & great Britain. Every days Experience Convinces us of the miseries that flow from want of System in government, of proper arrangement in our finances & on almost every department, & of that ruinous policy which influenced Congress to divide out to the different States the prosecution of the war. The new money So far as it is Issued has been Issued by the States at different values. Some at 1 for 40, by others as equal to Silver, & passes underall the disadvantages of State emissions one State refusing to take the Bills of another, & the bills of Pensylvania which Were Issued equal to Silver & have a tendry law to Support them armed with dreadfull punishments suffer a discount of 25 per Cent. I wish we may grow wise by the Things we experience, natural Causes uniformly produce the Same effects & to follow where reason & nature points is the perfection of humane Policy-the greatest difficulties we have to encounter arise from measures, from having governed too much in particular matters more than from any other Cause-for many particular regulations have Certainly encreased the difficulties they were designed to prevent. Sir, my Ideas of this business differ from most people. I Consider the aggregate wealth of the Individuals as the wealth of the nation & would give full Scope to their wishes & exertions to acquire wealth in a lawfull way, Cautiously guarding against any illicit trade with the Enemy & would fix Certain modes of calling into public use So much money as they were able to pay & the public wants required, this would be the best way of establishing funds, and as the resources of our Country would be almost inexhaustable under the Smiles of heaven if properly encouraged & Cultivated in this way I think we Should Soon become formidable not only to our Enemies but to all the world. Congress are about to recommend to the States to lay duties to the amount of four per Cent on all articles of foreign growth & manufacture imported into these States for the purpose of a revenuer-although I like the thing I dislike the mode. I think that Congress alone Can regulate the Trade & with Success Can lay duties on imports for the purpose of raising a revenue and I think they ought to be invested with power for this purpose & the States might grant to them the avails for any limmitted term of time or for a particular purpose-as they should Judge proper to Suspend a regulation of this kind which everyone must see is the most equitable way of raising a Considerable revenue, upon the Concurrence of thirteen States is at least to Suspend it upon uncertainty. Some are for Calling in the plate in order to establish funds but this would be unequal & be attended with great loss. There are but two kinds of public funds that I at present think of; one is money in our Treasury-the other is money in the pockets of the Citizens, the means of acquiring it with established means of Calling it out when the public Exigencies require it. The latter I prefer, it is the best fund in the world-give  every encouragement to industry & economy take of[f] every restraint but that of trading with the Enemy, & in the Course of one year if we are blessed with fruitfull Seasons the resources of the Country would be nearly doubled, Specie be introduced in plenty & we Should be relieved from a depreciating medium, our Credit be established & we enabled to prosecute the war with a vigor that must Strike our Enemies with terror & astonishment-whereas at present the farmer, the mechanic & the merchant are all discouraged & in Consequence the army is ready to mutiny for want of provisions & pay. It is my Opinion we are in more danger from the regulations that have been adopted & are pursuing than from all the forces of briton.

  Dr Sir Philadelphia Jany 29th 1781 I refer you to my letter to his Excellency for Sundry matters which I Shall not repeat in yours.(1)  Congress have agreed to appoint a Minister of foreign affairs-a Minister of finance-and there is a report upon the table for appointing a minister of war-& a minister of the Marine.(2) The two latter are to Supersede the board of war & of admiralty as the Minister of finance is the board of Treasury. The new Continental money makes its entrance into the world under many disadvantages. Massachusetts has Issued theirs 1 for 40. Pensylvania &Jersey have Issued theirs 1 for 75. The other day an application was made to Congress to exchange with the loan officer the money of other States for that of Pensylvania as the money of other States would not pass in Pensylvania-a Resolve passed accordingly in less than 24 hours. We were alarmed that all the money of Massachusetts would be brot. in for Exchange Soon if the resolve was Continued upon which it was rescinded as hastily as it passed. In Short we know not what to do. The new money of the different States is neither equal to Silver nor to itself. Maryland has opened an Exchange at the treasury & offers one dollar of the new for 40 of the old but the people will not  JANUARY 29, 1781  exchange at that rate. New York have represented to Congress that they have not the old Continental in their State to answer their quota-that the Commissary & Quartermasters Certificates to a very large amount are in the hands of their people which must be taken in taxes, that although there are quantities of flour &c in their State to Spare there is not money to purchase it. Is not this a wonderfull paradox-that there is in the States, for its so in this State, Such a plenty of money that it is worth nothing-at the Same time a vast plenty of provisions & goods & yet no money to purchase them-& the people Complaining they Cant pay their rates. These things Cannot Stand together, too much money Certainly there is here in Circulation-& that's the source of the mischeff. Call that into the Treasury-& enable the public to pay their debts & the people can then pay their rates-besides it would force people to bring what they had to market to get money to pay their taxes. In Short it would make the money valuable & the prices reasonable & of Consequence more plenty for the plenteousness of money does not depend on the nominal amount in Circulation but on the real amount in value & the proportion it bears to other things.

  Dear General Philadelphia Jany 29th 1781 After my return to this City I had the Honor of your Excellencys favor of the 16th Instant. (1) We (2) found that the almost total Dissolution of the Pensylvania Line by Furlough or Discharge was absolutely necessary & a re-incorporation the only remedy that could be applied for as a body they would have been Troublesome if not Dangerous. They are Trying to Inlist again and I fear too many of the Disorderly ones will get in. Should that be the Case perhaps it might be a wise measure to keep them always Seperated & Intermixed with other Troops on Detachments or in Garrison but I See I have already gone too far & I beg your Excellencys Pardon. I did not mean to Dictate but only to remind you that there are among them too many unprincipled Irish & English men ungovernable in their Nature & JANUARY 29, 1781  who are not to be Trusted Long together. As the Jersey Line under took to follow their Example having not the Same reasons as they had recvd both pay & Cloathing, I am happy to hear that Your Excely. adopted a mode for reducing them which with the former would have been highly impolitic & I believe impractacable. I pray That this Flame may not Extend further. I know it is a Trying time with the Americans in General but above all I Lament The Tryals you are Compelled to go Through But I am Convinced we Shall Soon be in better Circumstances. Our Political Disorder has in my opinion Come to a Crisis & the next Campaign we Shall See the Republick rising into Action with new vigor. We are now making Some Arrangements which Evidence the Recovery of our Reason. A Minister of Foreign affairs, one of Finance, a Minister of War & of Marine are to be appointed. Maryland has Acceeded to the association. Virginia has granted Congress all the Lands west of the Ohio. Our Plan of Finance is nearly Through we mean to try for a Loan of Coined Specie & Plate from Individuals in which I Doubt not we Shall Succeed as we mean to Convince them that they will be repaid in Specie. By this means we Intend Establishing a Bank to Support Paper for though paper Bills may well Enough Represent Silver & Gold That really does Exist yet when they are used as a Circulating media to represent Silver & Gold which does not Exist & probably never may-this medium is but the Shadow of a Shade. If this Loan can be obtained & Colo. Laurens Should be Successful in France I am Convinced we Shall be in a very respectable Situation next year & Even if he is unsuccessful, in a much better than we have been for years Past. I promise myself much from our Present & past Distresses. I find that Congress & assemblies begin to Rouse from their Slumber & Individuals are now Alarmed for the Publick Safety who have for years past been Employed in amassing wealth. America has undoubtedly abundant Resources but we Seem to have had neither Efficient Powers or Skill to call them forth. I wish your Excellency would be So oblidging (when you have Liesure to favor me with another Letter) as to give me yr opinion with respect to Colo Hamilton as a Financier.  Your Excellencys Letter with a Flying Seal was Delivered to the President & immediately read in Congress(3) & I think you may rest assured that Every Exertion will be made to Prevent Similar Disturbances. I am happy to find That Amidst all the Disorders in the Pensylvania Line they gave Such undeniable Evidence of their attachment to the Cause of their Country Even if it answered no other purpose but that of preventing unfavorable Impressions in Europe.

The southern Army remains in its station as does the British in that quarter. The plan of finance as also the determination of the affair of Mr. Delatour have been delayed for many reasons one of which was my being sent to quiet the disturbances in the Pensylvania line.

  Sir, Philadelphia 29th January 1781. The State of Maryland have acceeded to the Confederation, reserving to herself a Common Right in the wild Lands. Virginia have ceeded to the United States all their Claims west of the Ohio, including nearly sixty Millions of Acres. These Events will doubtless soon introduce the Principles of the Confediration in their fullest Extent; should that be the Case, no State can be represented in Congress by one Member only, Wch. will make it expedient for the State of Rhode Island, to send another Deligate, or reinvest Genl. Cornell with their Authority to take a Seat. To prevent Misfortune, I shall take the Liberty of inviting him to join me, should it become absolutely necessary, 'till the Orders of the State shall arrive.(1) The Differences in the Pennsylvania Line are settled. Another Mutiny has taken Place in the Jersey Line, but has been quelled; The particulars I am not fully ascertained of. I have recd. your Excellency's Letter, inclosing the Acct. of Monies advanced to the Quarter Masters;(2) but this is but a small part of what is wanting. I have mentioned this Subject in a former Letter. Upon Examination, I find all the Accompts sent forward by Messrs. Howell and Greene, are mislaid or lost in the Chamber of Accounts. This unlucky Circumstance will make it indispensible to send Duplicates.  I hope the Measures of Virginia and Mary Land will add Vigor to our Exertions: For the public Complexion is such At present that there is Reason to apprehend every Evil but that of Conquest, which I cannot believe the Almighty will ever permit. Congress are very incessant upon the most important Objects; wch. If fully adopted and firmly executed, I hope will re-establish public Credit, and give Consistancy and Vigor to our future Operations.  The Weather is very mild; We have had no Snow or Frost of any Consequence since my Arrival. The Post Riders are very uncertain  JANUARY 30, 1781  in performing their Tours, which induces me to prefer private Conveyances.

You are \""not a little thank full that the Robberies were committed now rather than a Twelvemonth ago\""; malicious Reference! vindictive momento!(2)  Yesterday Letters were recd. from Mr. Adams up to Oct 24.(3) He is greatly irritated at the vile Treatment which Mr. Laurens meets with in the Tower.  Oct. 144 \""repeated Letters from London confirm the Account of Mr. Laurens's being in the Tower, so close a Prisoner that neither his old Correspondents, nor even his Refugee Relations are suffered to speak to him.  \""There have been so many Precedents of Exchanges, Mr. Lovell as well as the Major Generals Sullivan, Sterling, Lee and others having been exchanged as Prisoners of War, that it is very extraordinary they should now treat Mr. Laurens as a Prisoner of State. It is not however merely a Proof that Passion & Caprice govern their Councils. I conceive it is intended to signify to the Tories in America whom they believe to be more numerous than they are, and to their Officers & Troops, serving in that Country, that now they have obtained an Election to their Minds they are determined to prosecute the War, with Vigor, and to bring America still to unlimited Submission. For however our Countrymen may have flattered themselves with Hopes of Peace there is nothing farther from the Thoughts of the King of England, his ministers, Parliament or Nation, for they are all his, than Peace, upon any Terms that America can agree to. There is no future Event more certain in my Mind than that they never will acknowledge American Independence while they have a Soldier in the united States. Nay, they would not do it even after their Troops should be all drawn from the Continent. \""  Oct. 24 (5) \""I have recd. several Letters from London concerning Mr. Laurens. It is certain that he has been treated with great Insolence by the Populace in his Journey from Dartmouth to London, and that he is confined to a mean Appartment in the Tower, denied Pen & Ink, and none of his Friends have been able to obtain Leave to visit him excepting his Son & Mr. Manning, and those positively limited to half an hour. He is ill of a Lax, much emaciated & very invective against the authors of his ill Usage. I saw a Letter last night from Mr. {Manning himself}6 so that there is no doubt of the Truth of this account.

  My Dear sir, Philadelphia. Jany 30th. 1781. As the intelligence received yesterday possibly may not be conveyed to you through any other channel at this time; and being well assured it will aford you much satisfaction to be informed of it: I have therefore taken the liberty of communicating it to you. Tho the information does not come officially from the state, yet it comes in such a manner that it is to be depended on-That Maryland has at last agreed to Confederate. We have the resolves as they passed the lower house, which have since passed the upper house. (1) This is a most important circumstance & comes very seasonably to our relief: for C_____ have been disputing for a long time past, what powers were necessary to enable them to prosecute the business entrusted to them, and were at this moment, as far from agreeing about it, as when we began. I hope now we have some certain principles to act upon, we shall be steady & decisive. Tho' the powers of the confederation are very inadequate to a vigorous prosecution of the present war, yet we must endeavour to make the most of them we can, and it is better to have some authority to regulate us, than, (as for some time past has been the case,)to have none.  Virginia has agreed to a cession of their back lands, with some reservations. This is also a very important matter, our present circumstances considered. I flatter myself it will give us some credit, which we stand much in need of, and may possibly give a spring  JANUARY 30, 1781  to our affairs.  Congress have been seriously engaged for the last ten days in a committee of the whole, considering of ways & means for defraying the expences of the present year. They have agreed to call on the states for a duty of four Per Ct. on all goods imported-the like duty on all prize goods, and one eighth of a dollar per ton on all foreign shipping. This it is computed will produce about 6 or 700,000 specie dollars. This is but a trifle when compared with our wants, but however we are going on.

  My dear Betsy Philada Feb. 1st 1781 My last was by Major Clarkson. (1) He is a young officer of military Merit. I wish you would entertain him with a Dish of Tea.  Our new Era of Government, I fancy, has occasiond a Revolution in political Circles & a Change of Connections. I cannot otherwise account for the long Silence of my Friend Doctor Cooper. I used to correspond with him very confidentially. We indeed thought aloud together. But I have receivd only one Letter from him since I left Boston, which was deliverd to me by Mr A Lee. I considerd it as a Compliment to that most deserving Patriot, rather than a Letter of Friendship to me. I have written several Times to him,(2) & once desired particular Information, which he might have given me without offending any Man, but he has not done it. I hope the Doctor does not think his Letters troublesome to me. He has no Reason to think so. But, he chuses to close the Correspondence, & you know, that I am disposd on such Occasions, to retaliate. It sometimes affects my Feelings, but I shall never be in Debt on that Score. You may let the Dr read this Letter if he pleases, but no other Person; for when I think amiss of the private Conduct of a Friend, I let none know it, but him & you; Indeed I shall say nothing to you at present that I would not wish him to know.(3) FEBRUARY 1, 1781  I employ no Pimps or Spies on my Fellow Citizens, & yet I hear of many things that are said & done in Boston. I may sometimes be misinformd, & I am always inclind to think I am, when I cannot reconcile what is said with the Honor & Integrity of Friendship. If Mr W C has \""spoken very disrespectfully\"" of me, I am sorry for him. (4) It gives me no Pain on my Account because I deserve not his reproach. I know he is apt to be sanguine in his Opinions of Men, & his Zeal in Elections has been commendable. But as I did not interest myself at all in the late Elections, he might have spared me. I have candidly declared, when I was asked in Boston, who I thought to be most endowd with those great Qualities, which should characterize the first Magistrate of so respectable a Commonwealth. This is the Right, it is the Duty of every Citizen. And had I been present, I should most certainly have voted for that Candidate. I may have been mistaken in my Judgment; and, as it becomes a Citizen, I will acquiesce in the Choice of a Majority of the People, who ought to know & prefer the fittest Person. If they do not, they are hardly worthy to be servd by any Man.  I hope we shall never fall into those Dregs of Time, when it shall be the Custom for one Citizen to treat another ill, merely because a popular Man has markd him as his Enemy, or because others, for servile Purposes, have reported him as such. This may afford Sport for the Enemies of our Cause, who are laying the Snare with great Art & Industry. James Rivington has publishd in his Royal Gazette, that the Acrimony between Mr. Hancock & me, was owing to his Attachment to General Washington, & my being on the Contrary, desirous of his Removal.(5) This is an old Story which Men have believd & disbelievd, as they pleasd, without much Concern of mine. It was a pityful Contrivance to render me obnoxious to the General & our common Friends. If there has been any Difference between Mr H and me, Rivington knows not the origin of it. Mr Hancock never thought me an Enemy to Genl Washington. He never thought that I was desirous of his being removd, & therefore could never treat me with Acrimony on that Account. I never wishd for the Removal of General Washington, but if I had even attempted to effect it, it might have been an Evidence of my Deficiency in Judgment, or Rashness, but it could be no Evidence that I was his Enemy. Mr W C may think that I am an Enemy to Mr Hancock, because he may have heard that I preferd another as a Governor before him. At this Rate, I must be thought an Enemy to every Man to whom I cannot give the Preference for an exalted Station for which few of the Many can be supposd to be qualified. Ridiculous mischeivous as this is, I am told that some carry their opinions further and that it is not enough, that a Man who cannot consistently vote for a Governor is to be reckon'd his Enemy, but he is for this Reason to be excluded from every Department. Who would wish to hold a Seat   in Government on so slavish a Tenure? The People of Massachusetts under the old Government have seen enough of the mischeivous Effects of the Governors having a Power to negative Elections; & I cannot see the Difference between this & his being able to influence or prevent an Election by causing it to be believd that a Candidate is his Enemy. He who gives his Suffrage according to the Dictates of a well informd Judgment, is certainly a virtuous Citizen. And is it to be supposd that such a Man would withold his Influence in favor of a wise Measure, because a Gentleman is placed in the Cha[ir] by his Fellow Citizens, whom he did not vote for. Such a Supposition savours so much of a narrow, illiberal party Spirit, that I should think no intelligent Man would countenance it. If it should prevail, it would produce evil Consequences; for some Men, if they are made to beleive their political Existence depends on their being thought the Governors Friends, will not easily prevail on themselves to risque that Existence by giving him Advice, however salutary it might be, & necessary for the Honor & Safety of the Commonwealth, if they think it will disgust him.  You may wonder, my Dear, that I send this Budget of Politicks to you. I see no Reason why a Man may not communicate his political opinions to his Wife, if he pleases. But to tell you the truth I consider this Epistle, after the License I have already given you, as indirectly addressd to the Friend I have mentiond. I would gladly know his opinion, Whether there is not more Parade among our Gentry than is consistent with sober republican Principles. Is it to imitate the Vanity of former times that every order of Men have been so fond of addressing the Governor? Are we to pay the same Ceremonies to the next & the next? Will not such high Strains of Panegyrick injure the Feelings of modest Men? And if there should happen to be a weak Man, will they not make him intollerably vain? Republicks should adopt the Rule of another Society. The Yea should be Yea, & the Nay, Nay, for whatsoever is more than these cometh of Evil. Adieu, S A.  ""

  My dear Sir Philadelphia Feb 1st. 1781 I have not had Leisure to write to you since the 20th of Novr. Indeed I am not willing to trust a Confidential Letter to a Post, who has shamefully been catchd in the same Snare more than once. I gladly embrace the Opportunity by Mr Otis, with whom I have had frequent & candid Conversations concerning Men & Things. He will be able to tell you some Truths which I do not think it prudent to commit to Paper.  You & I have been long struggling for the Liberty of our Country. I believe its Independence will be finally acknowledgd by the World. But are not many Nations, England in particular, called independent? And do you think the People of England are free? No People, in my opinion, can long be free, who are not virtuous; and it is no Sign of Virtue, when the Councils of an enlightened Country are directed by a foreign Influence. If I were a Minister at a foreign Court, my Vanity might be flatterd, in imagining that by having Address enough to rule its Measures, I might fix myself in the Esteem & Confidence of my Country, but I should entertain a contemptible opinion of the Wisdom & Virtue of that Court, if it would suffer me to do it. The Councils of a Nation must be weak in the extreme, or it must be reducd to the greatest Degree of Dependence to submit to so servile a Condition. You will not think that I have the remotest Reference in what I now say, jealouse as I allow myself to be, to the Amphictyon (1) of the United States of America. It is presumd they will always have too high a Sense of their Dignity, to suffer themselves and their Nation to be degraded. But when Peace is happily settled, and we have a Number of foreign Ministers about our Court, it will require Men of great Knowledge of the World, and Experience in Affairs to penetrate their various Intrigues. I have been assured, that the Court  FEBRUARY 1, 1781  of France would be highly disgusted with any of its Ministers, if they should improperly interfere in our Councils; and indeed, when I consider the Jealousy of a rising Republick, I think Nothing could equal the Impolicy of their attempting it but the Imprudence of Congress in submiting to it. But I am unexpectedly called off, & Mr Otis is just going. I intended to have written to you largely but must defer it till another oppy. Pray inform my worthy Friend Captn Bradford, that I must also omit writing to him, as I intended, for the same Reason.  Your affectionate, S A  [P.S.] Genl Ward Sends Compts.  ""

  Dear Sir Philada. Feb. 1. 1781 Your Favor of Decr. 20 by the Post was duly recd. and yesterday that of Decr. 31 was left at my Chamber by Count Charlus (1) whom I shall convince of the favorable Impressions, which you have made upon me respecting him, as soon as an heavy Ague in my Face will permit me to find his Lodgings.  Mr. J Adams upon Oct 14 & 24 confirms what he wrote to you on Sepr. 20. He thinks the ill Treatment which Mr. Laurens receives is an insulting Proof that nothing is farther than Peace from the Thoughts of the King of Engld., his ministers, Parliament or Nation, for they are now all his-Peace upon any Terms that America can agree to.  It has been pretended that Denmark had renounced the armed neutrality. This falsehood sprang from an Explanation of the Treaty of 1660. In consequence of which Explanatn. the English are to suffer to pass unmolested Danish Vessels laden with Beef which is the great article of Exportation from Denmark. All that can be concluded from it is that the Danish Minister who appears to be a Friend to England has taken this opportunity to oblige the English and at the same Time the Danish Nobility and are deeply interested in the Commerce of salted Provisions. It is their great Revenue. But this will not put it out of the Power, nor make it less the Duty of Danemark to fulfil the Engagements she has entered into with the northern Powers, in Case they are attacked on Account of the Convention agreed to between them or for having protected their merchant Vessels in their Commerce of naval Stores with France & Spain. The Fact is Danemark furnishes to foreign Countries no Timber except Pines & Norway Firs; She exports no Tar, Sail, Cloth, Masts, Cordage or Hemp, and therefore did not think it material to insist on this matter with the English.  This, Sir, is the Explanation given by a judicious Correspondent at the Hague; (2) who adds  The Plenipotentiaries of Holland brought back from the Empress a Convention founded on that made between the northern Courts, with two additional Articles, one having for its Object the Restitution of the Vessels taken from the Republic; the other to make Common Cause with the Republic & to defend her in Case she shd. be attacked, molested or injured on account of this Convention.  The English Envoy at Petersboug had declared to her Imperial Majesty that his Court would pay due Attention to the armed neutrality of the northern Powers, provided Holland was excluded from it.  It seems as if the Republic could not now retreat that she must sign in spight of the Opposition of the Temporisers who have now  FEBRUARY 1, 1781  no pretence for delay, without rendering themselves absolutely odious & becoming responsible for Consequences.  It is not doubted but Prussia will accede to the Convention; and probably the Emperor will do the same; for the Empress was so well pleased with his Visit that she gave him a Man of War. It is clear Portugal accedes.  To this foreign Intelligence, I may add that Virginia relinquishes her Claims northwest of the Ohio under certain Conditions; and Maryland confederates. Are we to sleep upon these Events or to rouse ourselves to one general Vigorous Exertion? Surely the latter, Yrs. affectly, J L  [P.S. ] As I send to Secy. Avery (3) the Virginia Act at large you will gain further Knowledge of it.  Mr. J.

I am most sensibly affected with what gave you encreased Pain the nearer you approached to your Home. I wish you may find Consolation from every Source which Philosophy & Religion furnish.  A Report prevails this morning that a Speech of the King of England is circulating in which he presses for Peace, but all my foreign Information bespeaks virulent War.  Holland cannot well delay to join fully with the northern Powers, as the Plenipoes of the Provinces have sent Dispatches from Petersburgh containing Articles of Compact similar to those which the other Powers have come into; and also two Articles particular, FEBRUARY 1, 1781  one to promote the Recovery of the Vessels taken from the Dutch by England-the other to secure Holland by the Power of the New Confederacy from all Insult or Injury with which she may be threatned for having become a Member.  As to the Puff which Britain makes about a late Compact with Denmark it is founded in an Agreement for a free Export of salted Provision from Danemarc and a Consent on her Part not to export what She cares little about, Tar, Sail Cloth &c. &c.

  [February 1, 1781] (1) The Delegates from Virginia have received an instruction from the General Assembly of that State (2) which authorises them to inform FEBRUARY 1, 1781  Congress, that the zeal of their Constituents to promote the general object of the Union and to remove as far as depends on them every reasonable obstacle to the speedy conclusion of an Alliance between his Catholic Majesty & these States has so far prevailed over all considerations of a particular interest, that they have consented to withdraw the claim urged in their former instructions to their Delegates on the subject,(3) to the navigation of the river Mississippi, except of such part thereof as forms their Western boundary: provided such cession shall be insisted on by Spain; and relying on Congress for their utmost endeavours to obtain for that & the other States having territory on the said river a free port or ports below such territory. In pursuance of the object of this instruction the Delegates aforesaid purpose that the following letter of instruction be immediately transmitted to the Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States at the Court of Madrid.  Sir Congress having, since their instructions to you of the day of ______(4) relative to the claim of the United States to the free navigation of the river Mississippi & to a free port or ports below the 31st degree of N. Latitude (5) resumed the consideration of that subject, & being desirous to manifest to all the world & particularly to his Catholic Majesty the moderation of their views, the high value they place on the friendship of his Catholic Majesty and their disposition to remove every reasonable obstacle to his accession to the Alliance subsisting between his M. C. Majesty & the U. States, in order to unite the more closely in their measures & operations three powers who have so great a unity of Interests, & thereby compel the common Enemy to a speedy, just & honorable peace, have resolved, and you are accordingly hereby instructed to recede from the instructions above referred to, so far as they insist on the free navigation of that part of the river Mississippi which lies below the 31st degree of N. L and on a free port or ports below the same; provided such cession shall be unalterably insisted on by Spain, and provided the free navigation of the said river above the said degree of N Latitude shall be acknowledged & guaranteed by his C Majesty to the Citizens of the United States in Common with his own subjects. It is the Order of Congress at the same time that you exert every possible effort to obtain from his C. Majesty the Use of the river aforesaid with a free port or ports below the said 31 st degree of N. Latitude for the Citizens of the United States, under such regulations & restrictions only as may be a necessary safeguard against illicit commerce.(6) ""

  Sir, Philadelphia. Febry. 3d. 1781. The General Assembly of Maryland have at length acceded to the Confederation and Perpetual Union of the United States of America; and the Delegates of that State, which has been unrepresented in Congress for two months, are expected here every day with ample powers to compleat this business. Virginia has ceded to the United States all their pretensions to the lands on the West side of the Ohio: Cessions of the like kind have been made by New-York and Connecticut, and are expected from other States.  On this occasion a new Era will commence, and it is now become necessary that Delaware should have two Delegates at least in Congress,(1) otherwise after the arrival of the Maryland Delegates it will have no voice there; and there never was a period when a Representation was more essential to it; from that time, by the 8th Article, all the expences of the war & for the general welfare are to be supplied by the several States in proportion to the value of the improved, granted or surveyed lands within each, which value is to be estimated & fixed by the United States in Congress assembled.  I most heartily congratulate the General Assembly on this auspicious event. Our Enemies can no longer say, we are but a rope of sand. Our whole Government is now established, but it will require considerable improvements to bring it to perfection: however our State has no reason to complain of it's weight in the scale of Confederation, and I flatter myself its Inhabitants will yet be as happy as any society of people under the Heavens.  Permit me Sir, to observe, that by a clause in the 6th Article of the Confederation we have covenanted with the other States \""always to keep up a well regulated and disciplined Militia, sufficiently armed and accoutred, and that we shall provide & have constantly ready for use, in public stores, a due number of field pieces & tents, and a [proper] quantity of arms, ammunition and camp equipage. \"" On the faithful performance of this, our being free not only from invasions, but even from conquest; nay upon this, not only our reputation as a State, but our political salvation and Independence, will in a great degree depend. The utility of this will appear manifest on a comparitive view of the States of New-Jersey and Virginia; in  FEBRUARY 3, 1781  the former the Enemy dare not shew themselves, in the latter, about fifteen hundred Refugees & Traitors, with the Arch-Traitor & Parricide Arnold, at their head, can traverse, plunder & lay waste a large country almost with impunity. I should be wretched indeed, if these Dregs of the British Army, they the Dregs of all Mankind, could truly boast of the like, even in the small State of Delaware. Need I enforce what I have so much at heart, and what appears to be almost self-evident, by informing the General Assembly, that the King of Great Britain has got a Parliament entirely to his mind, that every resourse of his Dominions are & probably for seven years will be at his absolute disposal, & that his own determination is to reduce us to unconditional submission, even at the risque of his crown; that therefore no peace is to be expected until his Fleets and Armies shall be expelled our Country & Coasts; and that when this is accomplished (which, with the assistance of our great & good Ally and his Associates in the same cause, may and will be effected the ensuing Campaign under the favor of God, unless we are wanting to ourselves) we have reason to suppose, from the example of the late Mutinies of the Pennsylvania and New-Jersey troops, that attempts may be made on our liberties by some Oliver Cromwell, tho' not a General, nor even a commissioned Officer in our Army. All these Evils will be overcome if not entirely prevented, if we have a good Militia.  Congress have agreed to make a requisition of the several States to grant them a duty not exceeding five per Centum from the first of May next on all imports, Prizes and Prize goods, ad valorum at the time & place of Importation, which they are to levy & collect in such manner as experience from time to time shall be found most beneficial, or tend least to the discouragement of trade. This resembles the poundage-duty in England, France, Spain, Holland &c. but will be vastly short of the like duties imposed in any of those Countries. Any additional duties on Imports, as well as all duties on exports must be referred to the respective States. The credit which Congress may derive from this Grant, having the exclusive collection & appropriation of it, and also from the Confederation being compleated, added to the lands ceded to them, it is to be hoped will in a great degree retrieve the character of & give new confidence & importance [to] the United States. You may expect to receive this requisition in form in a few days. This Letter, I know, will of course be communicated to the honble. House of Assembly, and therefore I shall not write a Duplicate to them.  I am, Sir, with the utmost regard, Your most obedient & devoted humble servant  ""

  Sir(1) Philadelphia February 3d. 1781 This evening gives me leisure to write to you freely; and as far as I am able to judge, fully, of the more important concerns of the United States. As many were of opinion that my Predecessor-was too communicative, my letters to the Governor have been dictated  FEBRUARY 3, 1781  by Caution, tho' containing general Truths. I lament, with the most Serious inquietude, the contents of this letter; but as they are dictated by the clearest conviction, you have my cordial approbation in making them Known, either to a Select circle, or the Legislature, as your discretion may direct.  From the first period of the depreciation of the continental Currency, the Cords of Government were relaxed; and with the rapidity of the former, the latter has Kept pace. All expedients, such as fixing prices, making Tender Laws, laying Embargoes &c, instead of alleviating, naturally increased the Evil. Congress, in order to make one great Effort towards reducing the public Debt and restoring public Credit, on the 18th of March last made their Resolve for Sinking the old, & emitting new Bills. Their Intentions, I mean the intentions of the Majority, were undoubtedly good; But, if a plan can be judged of by its Effects, they could not have adopted one more fatal to the great Objects they had in Contemplation. Its operations have been various in the different States. Some accepted it readily; some with delay; And others not at all. The consequences were that there was no Money in the Treasury. Creditors grew uneasy; Credit was Stretched upon vague promises; without the possibility of a performance. The Army unpaid, as it has been for more than a year; unclothed & unfed; & therefore mutinous. The requisitions upon the States for Specific Supplies were owing to the want of money; & these supplies have been as uncertain as the Measure was impolitic, and unjust; as it would necessarily make Some States Lenders to others without the consent of the former. Indeed Sir, we have neither Money to pay the interest of our Debts, nor credit enough to contract new ones. We are destitute of every requisite for the ensuing Campaign, and have it not in our power to extricate ourselves from Such an alarming Situation, while we Know from the surest Information, that Great Britain is exerting every Nerve to make the most decisive Operations. Notwithstanding these really distressing Circumstances, the Country abounds with Resources. Every article of Provision is in the greatest Plenty; Dry Goods are by no means Scarce, and West India Produce is very cheap. Pennsylvania alone has more Grain & Flour this moment, exclusive of what would suffice the Inhabitants, than is Sufficient for an Army of Fifty thousand men the Term of a Year. Money is by no means Scarce. Its true, the fluctuating circumstances of the Paper Currency may have made its circulation unequal, but still it is in the Country: And if there is not a Sufficiency of Specie, there is Plate enough to make up every deficiency. Our Perplexities do not arise from Poverty or the want of Men, but from the absolute want of Government. It is a fact as demonstrable as any Proposition in Euclid, that where a Number of Sovereign, Independant States are mutually engaged in War, neither of them is adequate to any of its conclusive Purposes: Hence  the necessity of a federal Union, by which the Wisdom, the Virtue, the Strength & Resources of the whole may be Conjointly centered & exerted. In this fundamental principle however we fail. For it is notorious that Congress have not the power of calling forth the Resources of the country. It is probable, I confess, that the Confederation will Soon be concluded; But then, we shall be just where we are now, in a perfect state of Imbecility. By the Act of Confederation Congress are not vested with the Powers requisite in Time of War. They are authorized to make War or Peace; but they are not competent to the means of Supporting Either.  Suppose they call upon the States for money or supplies, and some of them neglect or refuse, as they invariably do, where is the Power of Compulsion? And without that it is evident, the best Measures may be frustrated. We have stumbled upon Expedients too long; We have too long trifled with Objects of the greatest Magnitude; We have trusted to Heaven for Success to our Arms, while we have neglected to improve the Means with which the God of Nature has blessed us. Among confederated States there must be a Supreme Controul, equally effective upon all. I am confident, from Observation, History and Reflection that the present War never will be carried on with Success, till Congress, or some other Body, are invested by the States with all the Powers necessary to command the Resources of the Country. Trade & Commerce, those great Sources of National Wealth, should undoubtedly be Subject to exact Regulation; but if each State should undertake the Matter Seperately, every Gentleman of common Understanding will readily perceive the Confusion & innumerable Frauds, relatively to each other & to Individuals, that must result. Congress therefore should be intrusted with this Power, & of laying Duties; by which the United States would derive a considerable Revenue. If they could once command a certain, permanent Revenue, National Credit would be restored, and large Sums could be borrowed on the faith of a Bank which might easily be established. Those modes only of drawing money into the National Treasury, which are least felt, & of conseqence most satisfactory to the People at large, should be adopted.  Industry is the most obvious Source of Wealth; and indeed without its being generally encouraged, Commerce itself must cease; Taxes must cease and War must cease by terminating in Conquest. The fewer the Embarrassments therefore which are thrown upon the people the better. They should always have a Sure market for the produce of their Labour, and certain pay. To this end Embargoes should never be tolerated but upon the most pressing occasion; Such as at the Investiture of a Place, where the Siege may probably be turned into a Blockade. Of the necessity of which the General Congress, or the Commander in Chief upon the Spot should be the judge in Time of War. In Peace perhaps the Case might be different.   Hence exportations of every Kind, excepting articles wherein there is a real scarcity should be encouraged. From Policy like this, we should find all discontents removed; The citizens would feel reiterated Spirit and Vigour, Wealth would be diffused in abundance, & the Means of Government rendered familiar & by no means burdensome. I will suppose for a moment that the Expenses of the current Year will amount to Twenty Millions of Dollars including the Arrearages of the armys pay & the Interest upon Loan Office Certificates & foreign Debts, exclusive of the expenses of each particular State for supporting its own Internal Police. Where is this sum to come from? The New Money, supposing it to be productive, which I don't believe but in part, is equal to only half its nominal value in Specie. The Continent therefore would gain only five Millions of Dollars. Little is to be expected from Requisitions upon the States; For some collect their Taxes slowly, & some not at all.  If we rely upon a Loan from France, we shall be deceived; For the Minister of France will reason in this way-France & the United States are jointly engaged in a War with Great Britain; It is necessary for the good of both the Allies that as Great Force as possible should be exerted against the common Enemy; but the quantity of this Force depends upon the Ways & Means of both Countries, and the manner in which they are applied; Now it is evident that with the same sum of money France can exert treble the Force that America can, under her present impolitic Systems; Therefore, the minister will very rationally conclude that to lend the United States Money will equally injure them & France. From whence then are we to obtain the fifteen millions? I acknowledge that such an immense Sum can not be collected in the course of a year. No Country is able to carry on War by Taxation, or any other mode of collecting Money from Individuals in an equal Ratio. But there is easy way of making Six millions represent Twenty, which turns ultimately into an internal Debt. That is, when a Bank is well formed, Notes may Issue to a large Amount; & when the Holders find that they can receive their real money by applying to the Bank they will soon give over the trouble of exchanging, as they become fully confident in the Security, and find paper of a light carriage. Whenever Paper represents Money, it is valued nearly in proportion to the Substance; but the misfortune of our paper has been, that it represented Real Estate & all the articles of living without being funded upon any thing Substantial. It is well known that the real cash of Great Britain amounts to no more than Eight Millions Sterling; Yet their circulating medium in Notes, Inland Bills &c is immense. The same takes place in France, Holland & all the trading Nations. We certainly can effect the Same; But different councils will ever produce different Systems, and these Systems will of course destroy each other. Therefore the powers of revenue must be in one body throughout the Union. I hope Congress will Send  to the States, in a very Short time, Some plan, by which they may be invested with proper Authority. But in this Idea I am exceedingly mortified, & indeed vexed to the last degree. A plan of revenue has been before them and dwelt upon nearly three weeks; & upon my honour they have made no greater progress than a man of Sense would have done in three Hours. But you will say the delays of deliberative Counsels are a Natural Sacrifice that civil Society must make to obtain an excellent political Form of Government; True; But our delays are infinitely greater than they need be. There are a certain number of Members who have been in Congress a long time, & think themselves possessed of all Knowledge. A question can't be started however trivial but they make formal speeches, for fear the young members should misconceive the subject. And if the matter, as that just mentioned, should be of amazing consequence much the more time is thought necessary to properly enforce it. But if it requires immediate despatch, then great deliberation is essentially requisite. There are Some who make their ideas the standard of all Judgments; And if a particular Word in a Report should not exactly suit their mechanical genius's a long Debate ensues. I assure you Sir, they often make me think of Neals History of the Puritans, (2) in which the Speeches made in the Long Parliament are recorded at Length. And I have not failed to tell them upon the Floor that their Fate will be Similar to that of the former, unless they pursue different modes & measures. In matters of this consequence, I mean while the Revenue is in Serious Question, the Duke de Sully tells us every moment taken up in Debate is lost; & possibly may never be recalled. A Titus could weep that he had lost a Day; but we, I am almost constrained to Say it, have lost years. I now come to the conclusion; If Congress are not speedily vested with adequate powers for commanding the means to carry on the War with Energy; and if they do not exert those properly, a few months will put an end to their Existence. What kind of Administration will Succeed, God alone Knows. I have one consolation however, that we shall not be conquered by Great Britain; The people wo'nt Suffer it, But our calamities may be inexpressibly augmented by such a change. While I continue here I shall Spare no pains of Body or Mind to serve my Country; but I am determined to acquit myself in the eyes of God & Man of any fatal consequences that may attend our Public Measures. I might write Governor Bowen & several other Gentlemen; but I can say no more to them than this Letter contains; and I believe you will be sufficiently fatigued in reading it. My best respects to all Friends.  I am Sir, with every Sentiment of Esteem, your Very Obedient & most humble Servt. J M Varnum  ""

  Dear Sir Philada. Feb. 5th. 1781  Your Favor of Janry. 31st reached me this Morning. I shall see Col. Miles, and will deliver to him what Journals he has not already recd. for your own Use. I will also endeavour to fulfil yr. Wish in regard to Col. Hughes, remarking, however that the weekly Publications of 1779 are broken to Peices by the Spirit of those Times, some Members sending away Dozens of one Week while they cared not what became of the next.  Particular Classes are marked out by Congress to the Secretary, to whom he is to transmit the Journals. I do not think he can thereby send them to yr. Deputies, but I will endeavor to accommodate the matter.  I am particularly touched where you say you found at Hd. Quarters that the General had been not a little agitated with the paragraph of my Letter published by Rivington in which I speak of Genl. W. t You add, \""He mentioned Col. Laurens's Explanation of it as given by you, but, thought it seemed far-fetched.\""  Can such a Temper as mine prevaricate?

  Dear Sir Philadelphia Feby 5th 1781 I am honored with your favor of the 20th of Jany with Governor Wentworth's Commission Inclosed.(1) I find you Send it without requisition at which I am much Surprized as repeated requisitions ought to have reached you months Since for I wrote you repeatedly  FEBRUARY 5, 1781  on the Subjects but my Letters (it Seems) did not Come to hand. I am rejoiced to hear that you have Chosen two other Delegates (2) & beg you will notify them both to Come on as I wish to be relieved immediately.  You know with how much reluctance I accepted the office, you Entrusted me with: I assigned many reasons; I had many more which I did not think proper to Communicate at that time.  I find your People have been amused by a Colo Olcutt (3) to whom I paid very Little attention when here as I found, by a Secret Channel, he was much in favor of New York; & you may rely on his being Deeply in their Interest; but this time will Discover. I find that I am or have been Charged in your House of assembly; with not getting a Decisive answer respecting Vermont; that I said I was Sorry to Differ in opinion from those who Instructed me, & that I had much rather it Should be a Seperate State than not; & that I had taken a Grant of Land from Vermont as a Bribe.(4) To all these I reply with that Spirit which \""injured innocence Inspires\"": that they are all False & malicious. I rejoice Sir that no part of my Publick Conduct can Cause a Guilty Blushe to possess my Cheek, nor have I Ever wished to Conceal my Publick Sentiments as to getting a Decisive answer respecting Vermont, I Ever Endeavored to do it; but in the way pointed out in the Confederation viz by appointing Commissioners, New York urged Congress to Decide upon it themselves. The Least attention to the Confederation will Show you whether I was right. I moved repeatedly for the Commissioners to be appointed, but did not then prevail. In the Course of the Argumt I urged the inconvenience of Congress undertaking Such a Lengthy tryal, at a time when the army was Dissolving, the Enemy making rapid Conquests & the Independence of America tottering to its Base & Even when a Decision was given it could not be binding as it would be Contrary to the Confederation & not warranted by the Acts of New Hampe or N. York. Instead of Saying That I was Sorry to Differ from my Constituents, I Said that New Hampshire did not Expect Congress to Decide on it as a Body; & Even if they did I should Differ from them in Sentiment. You must remember Sir that the Committee of Safety Informed me that they did not Expect any thing further would be Done This time than to appoint Commissioners; So that I Did not Differ in Sentiment from them, as to the mode of Tryal. With respect to Saying That I would rather it Should be a State than not; I Deny it Totally in words I often Said I had much rather it Should be a Seperate State than Joined to New York. I also when Conversing with People who were intimate with Col Allen and others who were in power threw out Sentiments to Show that New Hampshire did not wish to persecute the people of the Grants with that violence, that the People of New York had done. You cannot forget Sir that in Conversing upon the matter The Committe  Instructed me to Conduct myself with Such address, as not to appear violent agt the People of the Grants, that they might when they found themselves unable to obtain their Claim of being an Independt State throw their weight in the Scale in favor of N Hampe & that if it could not be Secured to New Hampshire, to use my Influence for its being a Seperate State, in preference to its being annexed to New York. How Injurious then must it be to receive a Censure for Complying with the Verbal Instructions I received. As To my receiving a Grant of Land from Vermont as a Bribe; I am happy in the reflection that no bribe of any kind Ever was received by me upon any occasions, I never Spoke to a man who belonged to the Grants Except Olcutt & a man that was in Company with him, Since I Left New Hampshire nor did I Ever hear of any grant of Land being made to me by them. I will venture to assert that there is not a man on Earth, villian Enough to say that I had Ever the most Distant hint of Such a Thing. Allen & others when here avoided coming near me, or Speaking to me, & I thinking I had no Business to intrude on their Delicacy or unnecessary Caution never Spoke a word to Either of them. I Shall now follow the Instructions you Inclosed me,(5) one part of them I See is agreable to the Sentiments of Colo Olcutt which he Borrowed from the Delegate of New York. This has been urged by them with violence namely for Congress to Determine first whether it Shall be an Independent State. I am Surprized that no man in the assembly has Discoverd the Design of this. If this is first Determined, the Decision of the King & Council Takes place immediately & the Grants fall under the Same jurisdiction they were by the Edict of 1764. They will then Delay a final Decision by Every possible artifice till they get the mind of the people reconciled to their Government. Permit me Sir to ask you: if this Question was Determined tomorrow, & Vermont Should Submit; under whose Jurisdiction would they be previous to a final Determination? would they be at Liberty to Chuse for themselves? or come under the Jurisdiction that held them previous to the Decision of the King & Council? or would they be under the Jurisdiction which held them by the Last Judgement given between the Contending States? If the former was to take place the Judgement would have no Effect, Except that of producing Endless Confusion; if the Second it would be to Annull the Judgment of the King & Council without a Tryal & this cannot be Expected; then Sir the Latter must take place of Course, & the wish of New York will be Compleated; This they have been Aiming at from the beginning & I am Sorry to find that Colo Olcutt has brought the assembly of New Hampshire to assist them. I never Supposed it could or ought to be made a Serious Question whether this Tract of Country had a right to be a Seperate State. Now Let us Suppose for a moment that Congress were to try this Question & Determine it to-be a Seperate State, are not New Hampre or New York or both Stripd   of their right by this Decision? Then Sir Examine the Confederation & See whether Congress have any Such power; you will find that they have no authority to Determine or to try but by Commissioner.  The regular mode in my opinion is this; as the Lands are Claimed by two States (to one of which it most assuredly belongs) Congress are to appoint Commissioners & if they Determine it to be within the Limits of Either There never can be a Question whether it is an Independant State.  I only mention those things for the Consideration of the assembly before whom I wish this Letter to be Laid for their information. I shall follow the Instructions I have received, Let the Consequences be as they may.  Sir you cannot Suppose me Chagrind at being recalled from Congress as I Petitioned for it Long Since; but I feel myself hurt at being almost pressed to undertake in behalf of the State, & then to have a Tryal upon me & a Condemnation to take place without my being heard. I have now given the motives of my Conduct to my Constituents; & I am assured they will approve them. I wish the Gentlemen appointed may Serve you with more abilities; but with more Integrity I am Sure they cannot. I Shall not however repine at the Effects of Art or Malice; I am not the first Man who has Suffered for being a faithful Servant to the Publick. I Shall (however Severely used or indelicately Treated) attend to its true Interests with that Disinterested openness, which I have Ever Done. Though my feelings may be wounded, my Integrity cannot be Shaken; & whenever my Country in General or New Hampshire in particular call for the Exercise of those inconsiderable abilities which I possess they Shall be Exercised with uprightness & Integrity. I want no posts. I Solicit no office. I never did & am Convinced I never Shall. When my Country Demand my Services they Shall not be withheld, when they are not wanted I Shall be happy in retirement.  I Inclose you the opinion of Congress respecting Mr. Delatour (6)-& am with much Esteem & respect Your most obedt Servt.  Jno Sullivan P.S. I will forward the Commissions, as Soon as possible.  Feby 6th 8 oC A.M. The Secratary has this moment Informed me that he recd your Letter & will forward the Commissions by this Days Post. (7)  ""

He is a Young Gentleman of Industry and abilities, but I fear a little deficient in the Experience Necessary for rendering immediate Service in that department. However his local Situation makes him more desireable to the Southern Gentlemen, and every one to whom I have Spoken of you have expressed themselves handsomly, but objected to the chusing So many Officers in One State of the Union.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia, Feby 8th, 1781. I do myself the pleasure to enclose to your Excellency the particulars of very agreeable intelligence this day rec'd from South Carolina.(1) I think we have reason to expect many good consequences will result from this Success.  Congress have, from a conviction of the impossibility of their doing the whole of the business of this Continent within themselves, agreed to appoint a person at the head of each great department; that is, a Financier at the head of all matters that relate to the Treasury, a Secretary of Foreign Affairs, a Secretary of War, and a Secretary of Marine; these officers are each to take the charge of their respective departments, and to be accountable.(2) I expect we shall in a few days FEBRUARY 8, 1781  proceed to the appointment of men to fill these offices, and I fear we shall not be able to get persons who are properly qualified for the purposes. Those are all very important appointments, and require men of great abilities, great integrity, and great industry, and they should be men who possess the fullest confidence of the people.  Such characters are not very plenty in America, and if we should be able to find any such, perhaps they may be engaged in business that is more lucrative, or they may love their ease and peace of mind too well, to be concerned with any of those appointments, and the risk that a man must run of losing his reputation will be a great obstacle to their accepting any of the offices.  I am in hopes that the cession of the Western Country made by Virginia to the United States, and the Confederation being agreed to by Maryland, will now give us a proper opportunity of fixing with Congress our western bounds agreeable to the sense of our Legislature and their instructions to their delegates last year. As [to] Vermont it remains in the Same Situation the Chancellor left it.  The letter we rec'd lately from the President of Senate and Speaker of the Assembly is with a committee who are endeavoring to devise ways and means for the relief of our State; and I am convinced that Congress, as they are fully sensible of our distressed circumstances will afford any relief in their power.(3)  Enclosed herewith is the King of Britain's speech to his two houses of parliament.(4) But as we have it from New York, 'tis probable you will have it before this reaches you, from, Sir, your very humble Servt.

  Sir, Circular. Philada. February 8. 1781 Your Excellency will receive enclosed, two important resolves of Congress of the 3d & 7th Instant  Recommending to the several States, as indispensably necessary, that they vest a Power in Congress to levy, for the Use of the United States, a Duty of five per cent, ad Valorem at the Time & Place of Importation, upon all Goods, Wares & Merchandize of foreign Growth & Manufacture, which may be imported into any of the said States, from any foreign Port, Island or Plantation after the first Day of May 1781, except Arms &c as therein expressed. Also a like Duty on all Prizes & Prize Goods.(1)  The Monies arising from the said Duties to be appropriated to the Discharge of the Principal & Interest of the Debts already contracted or which may be contracted on the Faith of the United States for supporting the present War; and the Duties continued until the said Debts are finally discharged.  You will observe from the Tenor of the resolves, that if any one or more of the States immediately pass a Law vesting in Congress the Powers requested, it cannot take Effect or operate to any Purpose until all the States, that are not prevented by the Events of the War, shall have passed similar Laws.2 That is, at present, all the States except South Carolina & Georgia, and when all the states have passed the necessary Laws, the Monies arising from the Duties are to be applied to their Benefit, exclusive of the remaining States unless such States shall pass similar Laws the first Session after the Events of the War will admit of the assembling their Legislatures, and Congress have not the least Doubt of their Compliance as soon as Circumstances shall put it in their Power.  The Necessity of the Duties & Imposts being raised under one general & uniform Direction, is an Idea that will readily suggest itself.  I am specially directed to urge the Necessity of immediately calling the Assembly, if not already convened, for the Purpose of vesting Congress with the Powers mentioned in the enclosed resolutions.  Although it may be improbable any Person not particularly acquainted with the daily Business in Congress should have an adequate Conception of the Difficulties & Embarrassments that arise for Want of some certain & permanent Fund to support the national Credit and cement more effectually the common Interest of the United States; yet, I doubt not, the Wisdom, Knowledge & Penetration of the respective Legislatures will view those Embarrassments as very great.  It ought to be remembred that Loans are not to be obtained without some certain & permanent Fund established at least to discharge the FEBRUARY 8, 1781  annual Interest punctually. That, in the present State of our Finnances the Army must be in a great Measure supported by the States separately, in a precarious Manner & perhaps very unequally: and a Train of Embarrassments, too tedious to need Enumeration, must ensue which have already been felt in a Degree & must greatly increase.  I have only to add, that it will be of Importance to transmit to Congress the Acts that may be passed in Consequence of the enclosed resolves as soon as possible.  I have the Honor to be &c &c, S.H.

The Speech of the King of Engla'd to his Parliament and the narrative of Brigadier Morgan's Success shall be inclosed for your Information.(1) At the latter you must rejoice with Fear. It was in itself the most compleat Action of this War: but I do not force [foresee?] adequate Consequences. Our Army there is no match for Cornwallis, and if he pushed suddenly he will ruin Genl. Greene, who from dire necessity has been obliged to conduct himself by Detachment one of which being ruined, the whole will probably be involved in the Fortune: But if he had the 6000 he wants he could not feed them together, as to the King of England's Speech it may be construed for War or Peace, for, the only thing that can be gathered from it is that he thinks he had got a Parliament absolutely devoted to his Will. It is that which gives him more than Ordinary Satisfaction.  Our Prospects as to Money do not brighten. You may be assured that 115 were yesterday given for 1 and this at a time when every Body complains of the Want of Old Bills.  I think much of this Harm arises from the Tender Acts of this  FEBRUARY 8, 1781  State.

  Dr Sir Philadelphia Feby 8th 1781 Your favour of 1 5th ulto. I recd. per last post. I am glad to hear that the Collecting & recruiting business goes on So well in Connecticut. Genl de Portail arrived in Town a day or two ago from the Southward but brings no News more than is in the paper. Virginia has made a Cession of their Claim lying Northwest of the Ohio to the united States with Some Savings. Maryland we are very Credibly Informed has acceeded to the Confederation. No official papers have yet come to hand but I beleive the fact is unquestionable. Congress have asked the States to empower them to lay duties & Imposts on imported articles to the amount of five per Cent.(1) The necessity of a revenue-the ease of raising a Small Sum in this way-& the utter impracticability of its being effected in any other manner must Strike every person with Conviction of the propriety of the measure. I dont think the rule proposed for laying on the duties is the best but it is the best Congress would do at present. I think the duties ought to be varied according to the nature & usefulness of the articles. Some articles will bear a very high duty while others will bear but little or none-but it is to be observed, that the duties of 5 per Cent will rise higher upon articles of luxury than others in proportion as they are dearer. Congress have been newly arranging their Executive departments, have established an office of Secretary for foreign affairs-a minister of finance who is to Superintend & order All matters of revenue & Expenditure-a Minister of war-& a minister of marine.(2)  Genl Leslie has arrived to the Southward with about 2,500 Troops. The new bills get out but Slowly, labours under the disadvantages of State emissions & have various Credits which greatly embarrasses business. I Shall leave Congress about the Middle of April So as to get home by 1 st of May at furthest. The President & Genl Woolcot design to go home about the Same time. The legal Exchange here is 75 but the real Exchange is 110-which produces this ill effect that every thing is raised that proportion in hard money. Please to give FEBRUARY 8,1781  my Compliments to Mrs Ellsworth, with much Esteem & respect, your most Obedt., humble Servt., Jesse Root  P.S.

  Sir Philadelphia Feby. 8. 1781. Your favor of the twenty fifth came to hand by the last post;(1) I am much obliged to you for your information. I wish I could see the act you mention. You say the principles of it are Just and Righteous and that a few months practice upon it will restore our lost Credit. If it does that, it will be exceedingly fortunate for us that it was passed. Its being opposed by the three mighty men mentioned does not surprise me, for their conduct may be accounted for without any difficulty. Although the conduct of one of them in one certain  FEBRUARY 8, 1781  instance is not to be accounted for by me by any rule of honesty and Justice I mean the greatest of the three (in the first particular).  I am sorry the resolve ever passed giving the gratuity mentioned. I see no reason for giving gratuities to persons you owe, when the same sum given in part of the debt would have been as well received by the Creditor as if it had been given as a gratuity. In the one case you discharge part of your debt which you owe; in the other you part with your money and get nothing for it. I would wish as their is a call for six months pay of , that the resolve was reconsidered so far as to appropriate the money raised by it to the purpose of paying the debt due to them.  I am no more fond of calling on the states for specific supplies than you are, I can assure you it took place from necessity & not from choice. If manovre could be hit upon to place our finances upon a sure footing so as that the Public Treasury might be properly supplyed with money; we should have one half the expense if we furnished them by Contract. Untill that is done they must be supplyed in the way now practised.  I am told this state have been laying up magazines of flower in various parts of the State, and one of the members said in publick assembly the executive Authority had given orders for forwarding the same to the Army. If they do their duty as I hope they will, I trust the Army will not want bread suddenly. But to tell the truth there is want of energy in this Government, and always will unless the form of it is new moddeled and the people know more than they do at present.  There has been a mutiny in the Jersey line, since that in the Pennsylvania but it is Quelled. Some of the Massachusetts line were detached for that purpose under General Howe. He hanged two of the leaders & the line returned to their duty and remain quiet.  As to the Presidency you mention It is not a fact and cannot be a fact agreeably to the ordinance establishing the board, a member I am and that is all I have to say on that head.  Sir I sincerely congratulate you on the following agreeable & very Interesting intelligence from the Southward by express this day arived from Major General Green viz on the 1 7th of January last Brigadier General Morgan with a detachment from the army gained a compleat victory over Liut. Colo Talton at a place called the Cowpens in South Carolina. The action lasted 80 minutes. Our loss was not more than 12 killed & 60 wounded. The Enemy lost 10 Commission officers & upwards of 100 Rank & file killed, 200 wounded, 29 Commission officers and above 500 Privates made Prisoners, two pieces of Artillery, two Standards, 800 Musquets, one travaling forge, 36 Baggage Waggons, 70 negroes & upwards of 100 dragoon horses, with all the musical Instruments belonging to the corps. The Enemy consisted of upwards of a thousand chosen British Troops, Morgan  of 800, 530 of which were Militia. They pursued the Enemy upwards of twenty miles. This Genl. Morgan was a Captain at Roxbury in 1775. Sincerely wish this may prove a prelude to future success in the South, as the Bennington victory did to the North in 1777. <<I should have sent you the whole account at>  ""

Rutledge's Account of the same affair,(1) which is somewhat fuller, this is a great Stroke, but still our affairs in that quarter are far from being in so good a Train as I wish-our Troop's are in want of Equipments of different sorts. Leslie has joined Cornwallis with his force about 2000 Men. Virginia by Arnolds Expedition, (who has taken post at Portsmouth by the last accounts) prevented from sending on either Supplies or reinforcements as she ought. North Carolina seemingly asleep-& although our Militia & those of Georgia are daily coming out to Join their Frinds, yet Genl Green if Cornwallis advances must retire before him. Lee's Corps has joined the Southern Army, & when the last Accts. came away-Genl. Green had detached Col Marion, (now a Militia Brigadier) with 300 Infantry & Lee's Horse to attack the British Post at George Town. Col. Pickins who  FEBRUARY 9, 1781  commanded all the Militia in Morgans affair, had but lately come out & brought 70 men with him, they were part of those who formerly submitted when Williamson made his Terms for that District. Govr. Rutledge sent Pickins a Brigadiers Commission 2 days after the Action. Genl.

Squadron at Rhode Island, to convey the Arms belonging to our State which came in the Comite, thither in safety.(1) Since which my Personal application, singly, has been unremitted to prevail by the same Channel, to have a line of Battle Ship and FEBRUARY 9, 1781  one or two frigates sent into our Bay, but I have redoubled these applications and enforced them with the strongest Arguments I could address ever since the Sailing of Arnold from New york, having been always apprehensive that his design was on our Country. I am now happy to inform your Excellency, that in Consequence of our Joint application the Arms are on board a frigate intended to be sent as above mentiond; and of inclosing you a Copy of a letter from the Count De Rochambeau, which was this day received by Congress,(2) through Genl.

Your Excellency will be not less aware of the importance of being prepared on land to cooperate with these vessels shd. they arrive, than of sending on board proper pilots and Conductors, with every necessary intelligence of the Situation, state and strength of the Enemy by land and Sea as also the most convenient stations and Harbors for the Ships of our Ally in Case of necessity. I cannot conclude my letter without takeing notice how much we are indebted to his Excellency the Chevalr. de La Lucerne for the frankness with which he has Concurred and the cordiality with which he is enclined to promote every measure that we have Jointly, and I have individually had the honor to proprose to him for the good of the common Cause, and for the particular benefit and relief of our State.

Congress have Considered it to be indispensibly necessary, that they have Some established funds on which to depend, and among the ways & Means of effecting this, none appeared more natural, easy & equitable than Imposts & duties on articles imported into the Country-provided they are imposed by one rule & take effect at the Same time in all the States-and the avails are appropriated for FEBRUARY 9, 1781  a revenue to the united States. This will prevent any Jealousey from arising between the States-all will be Subjected to the duties alike- none will pay ultimately any more than they Consume of the articles-& each will receive its quota of the avails-wherefore Congress have requested the States to invest them with a power of laying a duty of five per Cent, ad valorum, on all prize goods & other articles imported for the purpose of revenue-to be exercised as Soon as all the States, who are in a Capacity, Shall Consent to the Same. (1) The reasons which Shew the necessity & propriety of this measure are so Obvious, we need not trouble your Excellency with a recapitulation of them for a moments reflection will evince that this is the only way in which the united States Can derive any revenue from Imposts & duties. This will be in Aid of the Taxes & a means of rendering the burden of the war more equal. We Shall be happy to find that the Measure meets with the approbation & ready Concurrence of your Excellency & the General Assembly.  Virginia has Ceded her Claim of territory lying northwest of the river Ohio with Some Savings & Extracts of which have been transmitted to your Excellency.  Maryland has acceded to the Confederation although no official accts. are recd; yet the fact is unquestionable.(2)  Congress have newly arranged their Executive departments & established the following offices (viz) Minister of Foreign affairs- Superintendan[t] of finance-Secretary of War-& Secretary of Marine.  We Congratulate your Excellency on the brilliant Success of our arms to the Southward under B Genl.

  Dear Sr. Phila. 10th. February 1781  Since my Letter by the Post (1) we are informed more particularly of the intelligence published by Rivington respecting the sailing of the French Ships from R. Island and the Detachment of Graves's Fleet in search of them. The fact was three or four Frigates left Newport before the Storm of the 22d ult. and two 74's and a Frigate were dispatched from the British Fleet to intercept them on their return. These as well as the French Frigates were exposed to the Storm and our accounts now are that the two British Ships of the line have suffered, one stranded on Montauk point, the other returned to Gardners Bay dismasted, the Frigate also retd. with little injury. The French Frigates we are informed are safe at Newport. It is probable this disaster if the fact is as represented (and there is little room for doubt) will give our ally the command of the water and De touche in that Case will make use of the advantage. Whether We shall receive any assistance in consequence of this Event will be soon manifested. I could not avoid giving you this information that measures may be concerted on our part for cooperation if an opportunity shall be offered us.

  Dear sir, Philadelphia Feby. 10th. 1781.  I received your favor of the 23d ulto. by Majr. Giles,(1) for which I acknowledge myself very much obliged to you. The intelligence it contained, was a most healing cordial to our drooping spirits. It was FEBRUARY 10, 1781  doubly welcome, as it was so very unexpected. It seems to have had a very sensible effect on some folks, for as this is a convincing proof that something is to be done, in that department, which for some time past had appeared to be almost annihilated, & forgot. They seem at present to be well disposed to give it every possible aid, in order to restore it to re-existence, & vigour; and give it a fair chance to distinguish itself. I can assure you, that, could we command the means, to put you in the most respectable situation you could desire, it would be done. But alas! the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak. Indeed the distresses of every department is at present past discription. A want of money totally unhinges every thing.  In the committee's letter(2) you will see what is sent, & sending forward, And this day Congress passed an order for £10,000 specie, for a variety of necessaries for your department,(3) which I can assure you is stretching a point, the state of our coffers considered.  Congress have lately passed an act for establishing a permanent revenue, to be at their entire command which if agreed to by the states, will certainly give us a tolerable credit, however, this will be a work of time. The act is transmitted of Govr. Rutledge,(4) & as he is with you, I thought it unnecessary to send it, as he will of course communicate it to you.  I am very happy to find, you are not disappointed in the character I gave you of Mr. Rutledge, and I am convinced, the more you know of him, the greater reasons you will have, for admiring his many amiable qualities, & extensive abilities. Both his heart, & his head are sound, & you will find him one of those characters, who improve on acquaintance.  The Minister communi[c]ated to me this day in confidensc, & in the same manner I convey it to you, that a part of the french fleet will soon make their appearance in your quarter. They will first make an attempt on Gardners bay, if nothing is to be done there, the next object will be, the fleet in Virginia & then to make a feint on Chs. Town. I give you the hint you know how to improve it. That is to say, if you shd. be in capacity to take advantage of it. At any rate it will most probably draw of a part of Cornwallis force towards C.T-which will give you a breathing spel.  Rest assured My Dear sir, that nothing, which can be done for your support, will be neglected.  I am sensible that your time must be very much occupied, by the important caus which have devolved on you; but whenever a leisure moment offers, believe me, none of your friends will receive most satisfaction in hearing of your welfare, than, yr. most affect. & Obed.

I shall embrace the first good conveyance for your letter to Mr. Dumas. None at present offers.  The inclosed papers will give you an acct. of the action of the 17th ulto. in So. Carolina. I think it does honor to the American army. Out of our 800 men, 537 of them were militia, which renders the victory still more extraordinary, & important. The enemys force were 280 cavalry, & 870 infantry, all pick'd men. Notwithstanding this piece of good fortune, our army there is in a most deplorable condition, wanting almost every thing & we have it not in our power to furnish them with scarcely anything. The states must soon do great things for us, or the insuing campaign will pass away, as did the last.  The President of Congress will by this opporty convey to you the act of Congress mentioned in my last (since when they have reconsidered and rejected the duty on tonnage). If it is agreed to by the States a considerable time must elapse before it can be productive. Something must in the mean time be done to relief our immediate & pressing necessities. Further means are now under consideration for this purpose. The two principal ones, are, a certain specific tax, to be appropriated only to the payment of the interest of a certain sum to be borrowed. The other is, to ask for a monthly tax, to support the expences of the campaign Vizt. 2,000,000 of specie dollars per month. We are very much divided upon the two plans, therefore it is impossible to say which will be agreed to.

Immediately on the receipt of your former letter relating to an exchange of C.

A vessel arrived here a few days ago from Cadiz which brings letters of as late date as the last of Decr.

The scheme of the Ministry to effect this is not yet public but I am told it will be on Similar conditions to that of the present year. 92,000 men are voted for the marine, and I have reason to think a considerable reinforcement will be sent early to the Southward and that agreeable to a proposition of Sr. J. Amherst the Enemy means to occupy and fortify strongly a post near the Mouth of Chesapeak from which, with a strong Garrison & naval force, they hope to interrupt the navigation of the bay and by frequent incursions prevent the States of Maryland & Virginia from sending supplies of men &c &c. to the Carolinas. Among the troops mentioned to be embarked there are three regiments of Light Dragoons. Your servants nearer G. B. will however give you more accurate information. I am persuaded that our Ally will take early measures for defeating these designs. This latter information is derived indirectly from conversations with men in a situation to be well informed.\""(3) Private letters by the same conveyance add that the blockade of Gibraltar was continued with great vigor, and that the Garrison began to be severely distressed.

  Dr Sir [February 15? 1 781] (1) I have waited long with patience, but not without uneasiness for the result of the Conference which General Sulivan proposed upon your Communicating to him the Message of which you were so obliging as to take charge. I consented to that proposition, not because I approved it, but because I would not be thought to have a disposition averse to the more amicable mode of deciding our affair. I felt, indeed, the indelicacy of permitting any person to Judge in an affair of honor, but as the proposition came from the party called on, and the deference was only to be to the Seconds, and as I have the highest confidence in your Judgement, and Sense of honor, I got over my reluctance. I expected that the discussion would be liberal, candid and ingenuous, and apprehended nothing like the refinements and Subtleties which you tell me are Insisted on. The Questions Seem to me clear and Simple and the State of the matter Short.  An Officer writes a letter to Congress (2) reflecting very Injuriously on a member of that assembly who had represented his conduct in the action of Brandywine. Only one Member had made that representation and that member must have been known to the whole assembly, but the Officer might not have known him tho it was highly probable that whoever informed him of the representation that was made, informed him of the Member who made it. The Member in order to put the matter out of doubt wrote to the officer, fully Stating the representations he had given, the opinions he declared and Still entertained, and the motives for both, which could only be a Sense of duty, and not personal ill will, the officer being personally a Stranger to the member. The member, having thus fully informed the officer, requires him to make proper Satisfaction for the Insult offered in the letter to Congress, if it was intended for him who now wrote to the Officer, and assured him that if the Satisfaction was refused a personal Interview must be the Consequence. The officer refused giving the Satisfaction required, in a letter which refers the member to Certificates relative to the officers general Conduct and personal courage and Insinuating, very Indelicately, that the member was prejudiced. The member answered this letter, and having animadverted on the Certificates and other matters, finally Considers the refusal of the Satisfaction required as a declaration of the choice of the other alternative. The officer replied in Terms highly offensive, being no less than that the Member was neither a man of Truth nor a Gentleman. Accidents for along time prevented their meeting, and when they came in reach of each other the member renewed his application, and required the matter to be closed by one Alternative or the other. The officer proposed that the Seconds should decide  FEBRUARY 15, 1781  what was to be done, to which the member agreed. In short The officer Insulted the member by a public address to the first Assembly in America, and the Insult must remain on their records. The member gave no provocation except in discharging what he deemed his duty, and free from all personal ill will or regard. The member very explicitly declares his Conduct, his opinions and his motives and requires Satisfaction for the affront, the officer afterwards writes several very offensive and injurious letters to member and it Seems, it is contended, that the member's having declared that he still held the Opinions he gave in Congress is Sufficient to Justify an affront that was given long before such declaration, and also all the Subsequent injurious language of the officer! This appears to be very absurd, and, indeed, I plainly perceive from it, that he who Contends for it, thinks that the member ought not to have felt at all for the affront given by the officer, tho in a letter addressed to the first assembly in America and to be on their records but ought in the most mild and Supplicating language to have requested an Explanation, and that afterwards the officer was not bound to any Such delicacy in expostulating with the member but was at liberty to use the most Reprochful Terms in the language, and it is highly unreasonable in the Member to be offended-in a word it amounts to this, Officers are under No Necessity to observe any delicacy with members of Congress or private Gentlemen and yet members of Congress and private Gentlemen must be extremely delicate and Circumspect even when they demand Satisfaction for injuries.  I assure you Sir I consider this kind of refinement and Subtlety as trifling with the feelings of a man of honor and I feel it as little less than a Second Insult, and I am extremely unwilling to admit of any farther Negotiation. However as I do not wish to be thought desirous of coming to too Serious a decision, unnecessarily, I will agree that one Gentleman be consulted by the Seconds if they cannot themselves agree, and I have no objection to Mr Wilson.(3) But I must positively forbid the Communication of it to more than one, and even to that one it must be under the most Sacred injunctions of Secrecy.  To prevent also all pretence for refinements in future I will here State the Questions which alone I will agree to Submit.  Was my Conduct as a member of Congress Sufficient provocation for the affront given by General Sullivan in his letter to Congress?  As this affront was given previous to any letter of mine to General Sullivan I must insist that nothing in my letter can or shall be admitted to extenuate it, except only the representations which it relates to have been made in Congress, this being the Testimony of that Conduct given explicitly by myself.  Were any Asperities in my letters Sufficient to Justify the reproachful language in General Sullivan's answers?  To this Surely Should be referred what ever may be deemed  offensive in my letters, and not to the Letter to Congress which contained an affront to A member who tho not named was, necessarily, known to the whole assembly and which existed long before I wrote any letter.  If the Submission is refused on these Terms, I must entreat you to proceed in the business on the Original grounds. I am Dr Sr. yours. Tho Burke  ""

  Dear Sir: Philadelphia, 15th February, 1781. I had the pleasure of receiving yours of the 5th inst., last night. I wrote a line by an express to the Governor, which I hope you will receive. I have very little hope that this will reach you. By a vessel, which arrived last Sunday from Cadiz, we have letters as late as the l9th December. The fleets at that time, as well of France and Spain as Great Britain, were in port; the Dutch had acceded to the armed Neutrality, notwithstanding which, the British continued to take their ships, and it was thought would make some attempts on their settlements in the East Indies. Mr. Cumberland is still permitted to continue at the Court of Madrid-a very suspicious circumstance. There is great reason to apprehend that the British mean to fortify and support their station at Portsmouth, or some other in that neighborhood, in order to shut up the navigation of the bay, and by making frequent incursions into the country, prevent the State of Virginia from sending aid to the Carolinas. Congress is every day engaged in a variety of matters, but under our present situation, it is probably best to say little as to the particulars. I hope to have some opportunity before long by which I may be more communicative. I have wrote a great number of letters to you and my other friends, particularly C. Johnson and R. Smith, which I fear have miscarried-having lately received a letter from Mr. Smith from Halifax, in which he complains of my not having wrote. I am now quite recovered, except a little remnant of my cold, which is attended with no other inconvenience, but that it makes me cautious of exposing myself. I am very happy to hear that my sister Iredell has quite recovered  FEBRUARY 15, 1781  her health. I was long under very serious apprehensions for her safety; I shall be very happy if we should all once more meet in health. Present my compliments to Mr. Johnson, and all my other friends; pray don't forget Mr. Barker. My love to my sisters, Nelly and the children, and believe me with the most sincere esteem, My dear sir, Your affectionate brother, and obedient servant,  Sam. Johnston.

  Sir Philadelphia 15th Febry 1781 I have the honor of inclosing your Letter, which came under Cover to me from Governor Bowen.  It is a very just Observation of the Baron de Montesquieu, that in all democratical Governments the Manners controul the Laws. We find that Observation fully verified in the United States. The Manners are generally corrupt, & the Laws but feebly executed. In Times of War, the Deliberations of Senetorial, or republican Bodies, being influenced by a Variety of Objects, are seldom directed to energetic and decisive Operations. The Result is frequently Disappointment or Disgrace. The public Checks upon the reserved licentiousness of the People are too weak to suppress their Clamors, and their Resentment is commonly satiated by transferring the Odium upon executive Officers. Misfortune is construed into Wickedness or Weakness and the shining Merrits of Years are inveloped in the illfated Events of an Hour. How ungenerous is the human Heart when under the Controul of tumultuous Passions! So reluctant are Mankind at the dignified Station of their own Existence, that they assume every kind of Allowance for their own Deviations, while they expect of others the Prescience and Omnipotence of Gods! You, my worthy Friend, have Occasion to realize these Reflections; And while many feel the greatest Inquietude at your present Situation, they expect, with increasing Satisfaction, your full Restitution to the Honor and Confidence of a Country, bound, by every Sentiment Of Gratitude and Affection, to hold you dear.  Permit me Sir, to wish you every possible Felicity in your present domestic Retirement, and a speedy Accession of increasing military Fame!  Be pleased to make my best Respects to your worthy Lady, & accept of the sincerest Acknowledgements of Sir, your most obedient Servant, & sincere Friend. J.M. Varnum  ""

The Mountain is exceeding Large & seems to be filled with Quarries of this Natural Concrete.(1)  It has some Properties of Common Glass, and possesses others which render it in Some Respects Superior.  It is equally Transparent, does not waste or Consume in Fire, receives any Color or Dye, and will not perceptably diminish in weight or Size by Frequent Attrition.  But is, preferable on account of its not being Frangible, Dissoluble, or Friable.  Though this Fossil has not been before Discovered in America it was Long Since known in other parts of the world; it Appears to have the same Qualities as the Lapis Specularis of the Ancients, and does not materially Differ either from the Venetian or Muscovite Talc: It has not the Reddish Color of the former, and is perhaps Exceeded in Whiteness by the Latter: but is in Transparency equal to either.

  Sir In Congress Feby 20th. 1781. You will perceive by the Enclosed copies that a Reinforcement to the british troops in the southern department has arrived in North Carolina.(1) Congress wish you to be well informed of some circumstances which render the situation of that department peculiarly in want of succour which can only be given by the troops of our Ally.  The people of North Carolina in that part last invaded are destitute of arms & military equipments, and so great is the distance of that Country from the only magazines from which they could be supplied and so great and almost insurmountable are the difficulties of transportation that there wants cannot be relieved in time to preserve them from the ravages of the Enemy. The people in the western parts of that country are fully occupied in the arduous Opposition to the forces under lord Cornwallis. The States of Virginia & North Carolina have it not in their power to Cloathe & Equip troops for the field, and the disappointments in receiving supplies from Europe render it impossible for Congress to give them such aid as will be effectual.  Congress wish you Sir, to take into Consideration all those circumstances and many others which are peculiar to that department, and produce such weakness as the public resources are not able to remedy in time for their effectual protection & which are well known to you-And they desire you to urge all those considerations to the Commanders of the fleet & army of our Ally, and if it should not very Materially interfere with the general dispositions designed for those forces to take the spediest measures for their reinforceing the Army in the southern department, or if this be not Eligible to make such dispositions as may Create a diversion.  Congress hope that the damage sustained by the british fleet in the late storm has Occasioned a change of circumstances so favorable to the forces of our Ally as to render them superior to the Enemy, and in condition to perform this Essential service to the United States without danger of being exposed to a superior force. This measure is no less important than that of opposing the Enemy with a well FEBRUARY 20, 1781  appointed & well equipped force in place of a force composed of troops perhaps destitute of every thing requisite for keeping the field.

  Please your Excellency, Philadelphia Feby. 20th 1781 Last Saturday Capt Paul Jones arrived here from France having been Sixty two days on his Passage. He has brought Some military Stores but no Cloathing. By letters from Doctr Franklin 10,000 Suits of Cloaths, 15000 Stand of arms, a large quantity of powder & a great quantity of Cloths were procured & ready to be Shipped as long ago as last August. One vessel with 130 bales of Cloth is taken & Carried to England the rest of the Cloathing Capt Jones Says is to Come with The Second division of the French fleet which were to Sail this month for America-the delay of Sending over the Cloathing is yet a mistery, but it is put in a train of investigation & by the help of Capt Jones trust it will be effected. (1) Doctr. Franklin writes that Mr Laurence has more liberty & more air than at First (2)-that the british Court Sent a Copy of the proposed plan of a treaty with the united provinces taken with Mr Laurence to the Stadtholder to be Communicated Which was done & the pensioner, Magistrates &c. of Amsterdam approved the plan-upon which Mr. York was instructed to present a Spirited remonstrance to their high mitynesses requiring that the pensioner & magistrates of Amsterdam Should be taken up & punished. What answer was given to this remonstrance he had not heard-that in order to Support our Credit in Europe & enable him to pay the bills drawn on him he has been obliged to engage that these States will furnish provisions to the army & fleet of his most Christian Majesty in America the ensuing Campaign for Which we are to receive payment in francs to the amount of four hundred thousand dollars.  By the English papers as late as the latter end of Novr.-it appears that on the question respecting the prosecution of the war in America in the House of Commons 212 in favour & 130 against-10,000  FEBRUARY 20, 1781  Troops are to be Sent to America Early in the Spring, 2000 on the 6th of Novr. were to embark in two or three weeks for Charlestown. By Capt Jones the Seige of Gibralter is Continued & it was Supposed in France that Count de Estang was gone to the West Indies. By letters Just recd from Govr Jefferson & Govr Nash a fleet of Ships have arrived in Cape fear river Supposed to be a reinforcement from Europe-probably the one above mentioned.(3)  The Enemy build their hopes of Success on the deranged & Supposed exhausted State of our finances, if we disappoint them in this we Shall tottally defeat Their prospects & induce them to reasonable terms of peace. It behoves us therefore to exert ourselves with Spirit at this time, & I think it promises the most happy Consequences, which I never so feelingly realized as I seem to at present. By an Estimate that has been made of our national debt it doth not exceed 30,000,000 of dollars.(4) The Supplies Called for are all indispensible for the next Campaign-we must Stop drawing bills on Europe, for the present, the loss is too great to be born by any nation, being as 60 to 92. December Journals are not printed. I write in hast as I did not know of Mr. Meeds going untill a few hours before he sets out. The President & Genl.

  Sr. Philadelphia Feby. [20?],(1) 1781 Since our last(2) in which we informd Yr. Excy of the Arrival of Col. Harrison in this City, his Applications to Congress have been referd to a Special Committee-and the necessary Steps are taking to Answer the wishes and wants of the Southern States, and of our State in particular as far [as] is practicable in the present Situation of affairs. We doubt not but that Gentn. will give you full Information of the Progress he has made in the Special Business for which he has been Sent.  We are happy to Inform you of the Arrival of Capt. Paul Jones in the Ariel, from France. This event would have been a much more pleasing one had he brought the cloathing so long and anxiously expected-his Cargo is however by no means useless as it Consists of about thirty Ton of Powder. It is Conjectured that by this time Count D'Estaing is Arrived in the West Indies with twenty two sail of the Line-and we are in great Hopes before this reaches you that a Ship of the Line from the fleet of our Allies in Rhode Island and three frigates will be in our Bay in order to cooperate with our Troops, in taking Ample Vengeance on Mr. Arnold, for his treasons, perjuries, Robberies and depradations-accounts being received in this Town that they saild from Rhode Island immediately after the Storm &? that Monsr. Destouches had taken effectual measures to Block up the Remaining Vessels of the Enemy in Gardners Bay. We have Sanguine hopes that this Expedition will not be fruitless, and that our Allies will find us in a Condition effectually to cooperate with them, as their aid will enable us to draw our whole force to a point. One of the frigates above mentiond will bring the Arms And Stores which were retaken in the Comite; which will perhaps not be an unseasonable aid. We have enclosed Yr.

  Dear Sr. Phila. 21 st February 1781. I beg leave to mention to you a young Gentleman captured by the Enemy when the Buckskin fell into their hands in Chesapeake Bay and who was put on shore under parole and wishes to be discharged from the Obligation as soon as possible as he conceives it restrains him not only from acting in the Field should the situation of his Country require his Services but even from attending the Hospitals for his instruction wch. he is very desirous of doing. The person I speak of is Dr. Jno. Lewis a Son of the late Mr. Charles Lewis whose name I mentd. to you some years ago while he was in New York and being refused the liberty of coming out was at length obliged to return to Great Britain. His parole is I think singular as it extends only to his not doing or speaking any thing to the prejudice of the Enemy witho[u]t the clause of rendering himself when called for.  You will receive from the president a Copy of a Report which has  FEBRUARY 21, 1781  passed in Congress in consequence of Col. Harrisons communications. You will also be informed of the arrival of Provost with a reinforcement to the Enemy in the South and of his progress since his arrival. Arnolds position at Portsmouth, Provost in North Carolina, and Cornwallis in South Carolina will I fear effectually obstruct the supplies from our State or so delay them as to render Greenes situation critical. If the French Ships from Rhode Island shall suceed in their enterprise in the Chesapeake the event will be propitious and produce the happiest effects. Our state will be thereby further aided by a supply of 1000 stand Arms and some Stores retaken in the Comite and sent forward in one of the French Frigates. The arrival of Provost and the great want of Arms in the Southern States it must be confessed presents a rather gloomy prospect and under this temper of mind you will receive a Letter reiterating what has I think been several times intimated, a desire that you will pay particular attention to the Southern department.(1) I wish we could but content ourselves with a communication of Facts and any reflections upon them for illustration leaving the combination and execution of the various operations of a Campaign to those whose business it is to project and execute them. P. Jones's arrival gives us no releif in cloathing or Arms, a disappointment the more to be regretted as our wants increase yet we know not whom to blame. Jones will I expect unfold this dark and as yet mysterious business. I presume you must have been informed that Virga. has receded from her former instructions to her Delegates in Congress respecting the claim on her part to the free Navigation of the Mississippi wch. if approved by Congress will probably bring abt. an alliance with Spain and an acknowledgmt. of our Independence. No doubt this event if it takes place will give us more Credit in Europe but we pay dear for it. We are abt. appointing the Officers who are to be at the head of our great departments. Yesterday Mr. Morris witht. a vote agt. him (tho' S A and his Colleague Genl. W. declined to ballot,) (2) was chosen Financier. I cannot say he will accept, but have some hopes he will. Our Finances want a Necker to arrange and reform them. Morris is I believe the best qualified of any our Country affords for the arduous undertaking. We shall in a day or two appoint the officers for the foreign affairs and the Marine. I wish we had Men in these offices as well qualified to execute them as Morris in the Treasury. Some however that are nominated if they can be chosen will do very well. We are under difficulties abt. the War office, least any person we could now put into it may answer so well as the present Commissrs. This may and I expect will postpone that appointment.

  Sir, Philadelphia 21st. February 1781. Your Excellency's Letter of the 6th Instant I have been honord with. When the Requisition was made to the States to advance six Months Pay to the Troops, I foresaw the Act which the Legislature of Rhode Island has passed, & mentioned here, its probable Event, with the Reasons that would justify it, but a Discrimination could not be made with Propriety, altho' I am fully persuaded Congress are well pleased with the Measure. (1) It is astonishing to consider the Energy of the small States, compared to the larger ones. If all the States had fully called forth their Resources, as one State has done, the War must have been finished long since. However, where everything dear and sacred is in Question, too much cannot be done by any.  We are certainly informed that a Body of Troops from Great Britain or Ireland, have landed at Cape Fear No. Carolina, said to amount to upward of two Thousand, under Command of General Prevost. This Event is convincing that the Seat of War is transferred to the Southward. Our total Want of Money renders every Attempt to render the Southern or any other Department respectable, inefficacious. But very little of the four Tenths is brot in. None from our State. We have Good private Intelligence that Lt. Colo. Lee with his Legion & a Body of Militia, has surprised Georgetown So. Carolina, & Killed and taken nearly the whole Garrison, being about three hundred. We are informed in the same Way, that Lord Cornwallis made a large Detachment after the Defeat of Tarlton with a View of retaking the Prisoners &c. That Morgan, apprised of the Design, sent off the Prisoners & Baggages crossed a River & formed an Ambuscade. The British attempting to ford the Stream were unexpectedly embarrassed with an heavy Fire, which killed many and caused the Remainder to rejoin his Lordship. I believe these facts, but as they are not official, cannot be too positive. Recruiting goes on very well here; Nothing is wanting but Money, to get as many Soldiers as they please. Arnold is yet in Virginia, & braves the Ancient Dominion with about fifteen hundred Men. I hope a Detachment from Monsieur De Touches Squadron will change the Scene. Capt. Jones has arrivd from France in the Ariel, & brings no Important Dispatches; has Twenty Tuns of Powder, but no Clothing. A strange Fatality seems to attend that Article; I hope the Censure will soon be rightly placed, & that Vengeance may follow upon its Heels. Inquiries of this kind are difficult & where old  FEBRUARY 24, 1781  Members have their Attachments & Aversions fixed, either through Cabal, party in[trigues] or honest or mistaken Biass, the Obsticles are proportionably increased.  We expect a few days will undoubtedly produce a Ratification of the Act of Confediration.(2) I must therefore repeat the Necessity of two Members. Estimates are nearly finished of the Debts of the United States, as far as they can be precisely known, of the Expences necessary for the present Year, and the Ways and Means appropriated, or [. . .] Expectancy. I believe Copies will very soon be sent to the respective States. However, Rhode Island shall not want Information in that Respect.(3) I am Sir, with every Sentiment of Esteem, your Excellency's most obdt. Servt. J M Varnum  ""

We are under a considerable degree of anxiety about the state of affairs in North Carolina. The latest intelligence from General Greens army was on the 9th instant, he was then at, or about Guildford Court House-Cornwallis at Shallow Ford on the Yadkin, distant from our Army 40 Miles & 250 from Charles Town. He had burnt his Waggons, & it was expected woud cross the Yadkin that day. The prisoners taken by Morgan were out of danger of being retaken. He had pick'd up abt 100 more since the action. This movement of Cornwallis is esteemd exceeding rash by the Southern Gentlemen here, but I believe if he advances, General Green will be forc'd to evacuate North Carolina, or to engage on very unequal terms. Colo. Marian has distroyd some of the Enemies Magazines at Wandaw Landing, & Dorchester, within 20 Miles of Charles Town, & taken 30 British prisoners besides some officers. I shall add no more on this Subject, as it is probable before this reaches you, some important events have been communicated to you from that quarter.

  Sir, Philadelphia, 25h Feb. 1781 I am honored with your official Letter dated at Richmond the 23d of December last, inclosing the Report & Resolutions of a Committee appointed to examine into the Accounts of the Delegates to Congress,(1) & the Expenditure of the publick Money drawn by them from the Continental Treasury; stating a Balance of £8467.14. against me, for which no Credit was given when I settled my Accts. with the Auditers & received a Warrant for £3740.8.7; which Conduct you inform me the House of Delegates look on as unwarrantable & highly reprehensible; and have ordered you to demand of me an immediate Explanation of the whole Matter.  In Obedience to this Order, Sir, I cannot in any other manner, satisfy the House of Delegates so well as by transmitting to them an Exact Account of my Expenditures from Sept. 1778 to Novr. 1780;(2) during all which Time I have been honoured with the public Confidence in Office. They will see, at one View, the whole of my Conduct, and may from thence form a Judgment respecting my Motives & the Advantages I have received; and, I trust, that to every FEBRUARY 25, 1781  unprejudiced Mind, the Rectitude of my Intentions in all things relating to the publick Interest will manifestly appear. At the same Time, I confess that I feel myself but little concerned about the Result of a publick Inquiry into my Conduct, having the fullest Confidence in the Justice & Candor of the House of Delegates; and, whatever may be the Event, I am prepared to meet it with that Fortitude & zealous Perserverance in the Service of the Public which have hitherto distinguish my Conduct, & supported me amidst every Species of Persecution from a Man,(3) who, from the Duplicity of his Conduct, & the self-interested Motives by which I discovered him to bc actuated, forfeited the good Opinion I had before entertain'd of him, and ought to have lost the public Confidence. \""It is the portion of Humanity to err.\"" I may have erred in this Matter; but_____ nil conscire_____ sibi,  Altho' I did not expect a Meeting, and consequently am not prepared to attend at the Session of March next, I feel myself happy in the Reflection that this Business may be conducted to a final Period, in that Assembly in which it was first agitated; I shall therefore briefly relate the Reasons which have influenced my Conduct, & submit it.  When I had the Honour to be appointed a Delegate to Congress, I expected to find a suitable Provision for the Subsistence of the Delegates of the State, at Philadelphia. In this Expectation I did not think it requisite to make any farther Provision than was sufficient for my private Expenses; which I amply did. I embarked on Board a Vessel with my Servant & Baggage & proceeded by way of the Head of Elk to Philadelphia; intending to provide Means for returning to Virginia by Land, from the Funds I had carried with me. Upon my Arrival I found it necessary to employ the Money I had, for my immediate Subsistence until it was exhausted. When this happened, I had Recourse, in common with the other Delegates, to the Funds created by the Delegation on the Security of the State, by drawing from Congress the Sums agreed on from time to time. This was indiscriminately practised by every Delegation in the Union. The Delegates of Virginia felt the Necessity of it for themselves, & concurred in the Measure. Their funds were appropriated with their Knowledge & by their Consent. No Member was refused the Sum he required, on application. The rapid Depreciation & the consequent Expence of living, rendered money scarce in the Pockets of the Delegates. If I expended more than some of them, I deemed it necessary to enable me to serve the State; and I expected to repay every extra Advance. I could have expended less if I had lived in a Garret, & laid myself under mean obligations for Civilities. It neither accorded with my feelings as a Gentleman, or was consistent with the Honour or Interest of the State I represented. By pursuing a contrary Method, I sought after Information and I found it. I was enabled to detect the Schemes & baffle the Arts of designing Men; (4) who, under the pretence of serving the public, I am fully convinced   had laid the foundation of misapplying the public Money in the Hands of its Servants by secrd Connexions in commercial Views, to support which, both Authority & Talents in my Judgment had been prostituted, by those who were beginning to reap the fruits of their Labour.  When I found it necessary to return to Virginia, the Means to enable me became also necessary. The Money I had provided for this Purpose would have been amply sufficient, had it been employed according to my Intention. I represented the Matter to my Colleagues, settled the Accounts of the Delegation, and remained indebted the Sum of £8467.14. by retaining the Balance in Hand; which Sum, if I did not return to Philadelphia (a Circumstance of which I was then doubtful) was to have been remitted to the Delegates as soon as provided, who would have Occasion for the Money, as Congress had resolved to make no further Advances to the Delegates on acot. of the States. With this view therefore upon my Resignation & on settling my Account of Expences in Lieu of Wages, I received a Warrant upon the Treasurer for the Sum of £3740.8.7; that by adding the Balance thereto, Remittance might be made as intended; and a final Discharge recd. from the Delegates against the Sum due on their Books; no Allowance for Depreciation being in my Opinion requisite on either side at that Time. I did not mention this circumstance to the Auditors, because I thought it absolutely foreign to the Business; and I received a Warrant for no more than was due to me from the Treasury of the State. It is impossible to suppose that I could have intended any Injury to the State by a Misapplication of public Money, in a Transaction which was open & regular, and which could not possibly have escaped Detection. My subsequent Conduct, tho' I may be charged with Neglect, proves the contrary, and shews, in the dearest Manner, that I did not reap any Advantage from the Transaction. The Reason of this seeming Neglect I shall explain.  When I returned to my own House on the 23d of December, the extreme Severity of the winter, and the Disorder which my domestic Concerns had been thrown into, put it out of my Power to go abroad and to transact any Business until the latter End of February; at which Time I received Intimation from various Quarters, that the hon. Richard Henry Lee had thrown out some Insinuations to my Prejudice, respecting the greatness of my Expences & the Misapplication of the public Money, as a Delegate to Congress. Knowing his personal Enmity towards me; & that the Money had been depreciated considerably, I determined with myself that the whole Transaction should under go a public Scrutiny, (which I had Reason to beleive was the Design of that Gentleman) and resolved not to settle the Accts. with the Delegates until the precise Value of the Debt should be ascertained. For this Reason it was, that the Account was credited by Interest on a Sum which was useless in my  Hands 'till the Time the Debt was transferred to the State, & considered as so much advanced on Acct. of the new Delegation, with the Note subjoined in the Acct. settled with the Auditors; which left it in a point of view proper to be explained; & by which compleat Justice might be rendered both to the public & myself; by paying the Interest which the State might be charged with whilst the Money remained in my Hands, & by returning the just Value of the Sum received, if an Allowance for Depreciation under these Circumstances should be judged requisite; a point which I did not choose to determine, or, by paying the Money into the Hands of the Delegates, subject myself to any Censure for having availed myself of what might be supposed an Advantage to me. For I beleive it would not be difficult to satisfy every one concerned, that I could at any Period during that Time have commanded double the Sum necessary to discharge that Demand.  I did expect that this Matter would have been inquired into, in the May Session following by a direct & open Charge; but I then met with one of a different Nature; and became well acquainted with the Mode in which this Enquiry was to be made. I have been silent; but determined to let the Gentleman who has played behind the Curtain, & who perhaps claims Merit from a Discovery, pursue his own Means for his own Ends. I wish only that he had been more speedy in this Business & that he had made his Charge openly, since he has been so long furnished with the Materials.  I shall now submit, Sir, what I have written to the Consideration of the House of Delegates & to their Determination. (5) I only beg leave to add what will one day inevitably appear-That I stood among the first in my own Country who defended the Rights of America; that I have been faithfully & attentively engaged in the Service of my Country, ever since the Commencement of the present Dispute with Britain; That my Zeal & Integrity in serving America have led me into Measures destructive of my private Interest; and my Confidence in the public faith hath subjected me to the Loss of several thousand Pounds in Specie. Under all these Circumstances I must finally add, that having never solicited any Appointment whatever, or received any Emoluments equal to my Expences, I shall esteem myself happy whenever my Country shall be pleased to inform me that they have no further Occasion for my Services.  I have the Honor to be with perfect Respect, Sir, Yr. most obedt. & most humble Servant, M. Smith  ""

  Sir Philadelpa. 26th Febry. 1781 I cannot Say wheither I have Acknowledged your Favour of the 16th Ult.-if I have not you will beleive it to be owing to any Cause rather than a Want of respect for you.  Our News from the Southward (1) is that after the Action of Morgan, with Tarlton-Cornwallis in his Rage destroyed his Waggons- double Mounted Six hundred Horses and Set forward to overtake Morgan. By the Sudden rise of a River over which Genl. Morgan had passed-Cornwallis was impeded for five Days which gave Morgan an Oppertunity to Retreat (after having left his heavy Baggage) within the Confines of Virginia-Cornwallis Augmented his Troops with those who had landed at Cape Fear to about Twenty five hundred-And has come forward to Roanoke Genl. Green not having it in his Power to oppose him. This last March of Cornwallis has been about Two hundred Miles thro' a thinly Settled Country. I cannot learn that the People of the Country have either joined or opposed him in his March. This Movement would seem to have been a disperate one. It will be Strange if he shall be able either to continue his Progress or to Return to Cape Fear. Arnold is Blocked in at Portsmouth by a French 64 Gun Ship and some Frigates. The Militia are collected to about 2700. The Event of this Measure will probably be soon Ascertained.  Mr. R. Morrice is appointed Superintendant of Finance. The other officers to the Executive Departments are not yet made. I have Wrote Two Letters to Mr. Ellsworth which I hope he has recd,(2) in my last I mentioned to him that I should soon Return Home-which I shall expect to do As soon as the Roads are settled.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia Feby 27th. 1781  I wrote your Excellency a few lines by Capt. McClane-he left this place last Sunday; I then acknowledg'd the receipt of yours by Col Livingston;(1) particular attention shall be immediately payd to yr commands. I beg leave to refer you to the enclosd paper for intelligence respecting what Mr Hanson & myself wrote you yesterday by express.(2)  Cornwallis continues a rapid progress thro' North Carolina, his force from 2500 to 3000. Morgan, & the prisoners with him, escapd by a providential rain which swelled the waters just after he had pass'd the Catawba, this detaind the other some days. Morgan soon after joind General Green, & the prisoners had proceeded beyond danger, he had pickd up abt 100 More prisoners than what is mentiond in the Publishd acct of the Battle of the Cowpens. General Green was on the 10th at Guilford Court, his force not more than 1427 Regular infanty & 600 Militia, & Lees Legion which had joind him. The General was to retreat the next day, & is determind to avoid a general engagement, until he is in sufficient force to ensure Success, & I believe will not depend too much on Militia, notwithstanding the Battle of the Cowpens. Govr Jefferson says in a Letter of the 17th Inst that he was informd our Army had got on this Side of the Roanoke, & the Enemies was advancd to Staunton. This is on the Verge of Virginia. The Conventioners in Virginia, & the prisoners taken in Carolina are on their march to the Northward, [and] will probably be Stationd in Lancaster. I hope those in Frederick Town likewise-a Committee will report on that Subject to day, or to morrow .(3)  I am with great esteem, yr. Excellencys Most Ob Servt.  Danl. Carroll  P.S.

  My dearest Polly Philadelphia 27 Febry. 1781.  I was lately favoured with a Letter from our Brother Walter which assured me of your Health and that of our Family and Friends. It is a pleasure that I feel most sensibly. He informs me that Mr Meiggs has given up the Academy at Claaverack for a place at New Haven Colledge and our Son (1) of course is once more without a Preceptor. I hope the Trustees of that Seminary, however unfortunate hitherto, will have the Spirit to persevere in supporting an Institution so honorable and essential. If not we must be contented to place our Son at a greater distance from us tho considering his youth it will not be very eligible. I can hardly trust myself with giving you an opinion on our Affairs to the Southward. The prospect is fair but the Events of war are so uncertain that we wait for Intelligence with much Sollicitude. Both Cornwallis and Arnold seem to hang upon a Thread and yet they may possibly escape: With a small portion of good fortune on our side they must share the fate of Burgoine. You may be assured that if we had planned their ruin, and coud have compelled them to fall in with that plan, it coud not have placed them in more desperate Circumstances. I suppose you have Heard the Report of a great Naval Victory obtaind by Count d Estaign over Commodore Hood. The English it is said lost seven Ships of the Line and ninety four Transports. If this proves true it must produce very important Consequences.  Our dear daughter writes you by this opportunity.(2) I have desired her to inform you how she passes her time.

  Dear Sir: Philadelphia, 27th February, 1781. Your letter giving an account of Morgan's victory, I had the pleasure to receive yesterday, but have heard nothing of those sent by the gentlemen to Virginia. Our accounts from General Cornwallis are very alarming, but we hope it will not be long before both he and Arnold will repent of their rashness. Congress are not inattentive to the state of the Southern States, but the unfortunate mutinies in the Army, and other unavoidable accidents have prevented them sending on more Troops, and put it out of their power to make such ample provision for those that were sent as would have been wished. Should the report, which from different quarters has arrived at different towns to the eastward, with regard to Count D'Estaing's having taken seven Ships of the Line, three Frigates and the greatest part of 90 sail of Transports of Sir Samuel Hood's Squadron off the Western Islands, be true, it will be a favorable presage of the success of the ensuing campaign. The French fleet hold the British ships blocked up in Gardiner's Bay, and only wait the arrival of the expected reinforcements to lay hands on. The safety or destruction of the British fleet, under Admiral Arbuthnot, depends entirely on this circumstance, whether a French or British reinforcement first  FEBRUARY 27, 1781  arrives. The chances at present appear to me in favor of our Allies. General Washington will not neglect the relief of North Carolina, when circumstances will admit. I dare not be more particular, but hope before this reaches you, Arnold's fate will be decided. I received Mr. Johnson's letter of the 6th January only yesterday. Be so good as to present my compliments to him, and let him know I wrote a long letter to him last week by the way of Halifax. (1) Remember me to all our other friends. My love to my sisters, Nelly and the children: I long very much to see you and them, and am ever, My dear sir, Your affectionate and obedient servant,  Sam.

  Dr. Sr. Phila: 27th. Febry 1781 I missed the opportunity by the Express of sending you the Letter of the 21 st which is now inclosed as it contains a request respecting Dr. Lewis and will serve to shew you I meant to pay my Compliments to you as soon as I was certain after my arrival you had declined your visit to R. Island. Ld. Cornwallis has put every thing to the hazard and if the people of Virga. and North Carolina have not the Spirit to turn out and support Genl. Greene under the present fair prospect of totally ruining his Ld. Ship's Army they deserve not the blessings we are contending for. Genl. Greenes Conduct has been judicious indeed from the wise measures concerted by him for the arrangement and support of the southern department and wch. was communicated by him to the assembly while I was at Richmond, I entertained very favourable sentiments of that Gentlemans fitness for the Command of the southern Army and his behavior since has manifested he is equal to the appointment. If he is properly supported He will give us a good account of Cornwallis. I was concerned when I came to Congress to hear so small a favor was refused Genl. Greene then going to his new Command as that of granting his request respecting Dr. McHenry.(1) From my conversation with Gentlemen on the subject many think the Genl. Shod. have been indulged and if it can be done the question will probably be revived. This however the Dr. shod. not be acquainted with, least the attempt shod. be unsuccessfull. Thursday next is appointed for the Maryland Delegates to subscribe the Articles of Confederation, an event that cannot fail articles it is certain are defective and amendments and additional powers are necessary and these will and must be speedily proposed to the States for their concurrence and no time perhaps more FEBRUARY 27, 1781  convenient for their meeting the attention and approbation of the States than the present when they are generally convinced of the want of full powers and are disposed to grant them. Any defect that have occurred to you and no doubt many have from your Situation and long service you will oblige me in pointing out when you have leisure to write a few lines on the subject. It is of importance to make the articles of our Union as compleat as may be and adequate to the great objects of the Confederacy or we shall suffer from internal divisions & foreign machinations. I am happy to find a strong reinforcement is going South. If Arnold does not escape before their arrival that abandoned Man will probably meet the fate he deserves. The British affairs to the Southward are now in a critical situation and if we improve the advantages the conjuncture opens to us all will soon be restored there to the power of the States, Charles Town excepted and even that if our Ally can succour us by Water, I have my hopes may be recovered.

  Sir, Philadelphia February 27th. 1781 We beg Leave to communicate to the honorable Senate & House of Representatives a Circumstance which for some Time past has kept us in a State of Anxiety.  The Secretary duely transmitted the Credentials of our Reappointment in the Month of October under the same Regulations for Attendance here and Voting in Congress as were our Rule the last Year. But, he has since forwarded an Act passed November 21st by which not less than three of the Delegates can make a Representation of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  As we were informed that oeconomy alone originated the latter Act we ventured to suppress it from being entered on the Records of Congress, where it would operate against the Interest of our Constituents, would not help the Reputation of our absent Colleagues, and would cast a comparitive Stigma on our own. For, it would put  FEBRUARY 27, 1781  the Vote of Massachusetts to a trebly-increased Risque from our Sickness and other temporary Incapacity to be present in Congress; It would not repeal the former Order for a fourth to be upon the Business of the Delegation; and it would put the whole Three now here only on a par with one from New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Delaware or with two from those & other States, when the Accession of Maryland shall be recorded here.(1) We satisfied ourselves with hinting this matter to the Gentlemen who have lately returned Home from joint Duty with Us, and who are now in the General Assembly: But, we apprehend they may find more Difficulty in obtaining a new Act for regulating the Delegation than we shall in obtaining the Sense of the Assembly in a Letter from the Governor, to sanctify our Continuance in the Suppression which began from our Zeal to preserve the Opportunities of being the most useful to our Constituents.(2) With Sentiments of the greatest Respect for the General Assembly we submit ourselves,  Saml Adams  James Lovell Artemas Ward ""

  Sir Philadelphia Feby. 27th. 1781. Your thanks to me expressed in a letter which was read in Congress yesterday, for a few notes on the geography of the back parts of South and North Carolina was very flattering.(1) For your farther information I shall now take the liberty to add, That after Lord Cornwallis had destroyd his waggons and heavy baggage near the cross roads at the head of fishing creek he advanced in a north west direction, passed the So fork of Catawba river and Cowens ford on the main branch about twenty miles north west of Charlotte, where Davidson unfortunately fell opposing him. Mrs. Terrences [. . .] is about eight miles from that ford, on the road leading to Salisbury which is twenty eight miles from Terrences FEBRUARY 27, 1781  Trading ford on the Yadkin is seven miles from Salisbury. The shallow ford is thirty miles above, and fifteen miles from Salem, the lower Moravian town. Guilford Court house is near a place called New Garden on Hutchisons map and twenty six miles from Salem. Boyds ferry on Dan is not many miles above the confluence of that with Stanton river and about sixty miles from Guilford Ct. House.  I suppose Lord Cornwallis's first object was to rescue the prisoners and break up Morgans corps, in which he failed. The second was to disperse Genl. Greenes army, but when his Lordship observes that Genl. Greene has very judiciously retreated to Stanton, I am inclined to think he will file off to the right and endavour to make his retreat to Wilmington on Cape Fear river, which he may do without much opposition as the inhabitants on the greater part of that river are disposed, at least to neutrality. In such case Genl. Greenes army would not be in condition to pursue him with facility. If on the other hand he continues his pursuit of Genl. Greene into the borders of Virginia, and the Militia fails to improve the advantages they may gain by concurring with Genl. Greene, they will loose those laurels which they have obtained by their former exertions.  You Sir, know very well that when the enemy are advancing so rapidly, militia are not generally disposed to join a retreating army, and that country being very extensive and thinly settled it is therefore several days before any considerable force can be collected to a point, but if his Lordship can be diverted five or six days in any one place in that back country I hope he will catch a Tartar.  Your Excellency may apprehend that the Milit[ia in] the vicinity of Salisbury and Charlotte, who have heretofore distingished themselves by their firmness, will fly to arms and press on the enemys rear, but you may rely upon it, that the fall of Genl. Davidson has left that people without an head in whom they have confidence as an officer. From my particular knowledge of that part of the country I can venture to say that in the fall of that officer we have lost more than 500 men in the common defence.  Davidson was a native of Rowan County of which Salisbury is the seat, he was Lieut. Colo. in the first No Carolina Regt. under Colo. Clarke, obtained leave of absence from Genl. Hogan in Decr. 1779 to visit his family and join his regt. in Charles Town the first of May, but was prevented by the blockade of the Town. On the capture of Genl. Rutherford at Genl. Gates's defeat, he was appointed by our legislature to command the militia of that district in Rutherfords absence.  I think I may venture to congratulate your Excellency on the news from the West Indias.   Excuse the liberty I have taken in addressing you without any introduction, and be assured that the State which I have the honor to represent has the same esteem for and entire confidence in you, that is impressed on the heart of him, who has the honor to be, Sir, Your Most Obt. Humble Servt. Wm. Sharpe  ""

  Sir, Philadelphia Feby. 28 1781 As I feel my self much aggrieved by the late Arrangement of the Medical Department, I take the Liberty of stating my Case to your FEBRUARY 28, 1781  Excellency, as briefly as I can, & beg you will lay it before the Honble. Congress, who being disposed to do equal Justice to all their Servants, will I persuade my self; seriously consider the disagreeable Situation to which I am reduced, & afford the desired Relief.(1)  It is I confess a disagreeable Subject, & peculiarly is to me, to be obliged to speak in my own Behalf, but it appears necessary at present, to vindicate my injured Character, & endeavour to obtain that Justice, which is due to me & my Family & That, is all which I ask, & that I hope & believe will not be denied.  It is well known, that I early engaged in the Cause of Liberty & my Country, & took an active, decided Part. I was Chairman of the Committee of the County, from the Beginning of the Controversy, untill the Constitution of the State of New Jersey, was formed, when the Legislature were pleased to appoint me a Judge of the County, which Office I have executed with Impartiality & Firmness ever since, in the Vicinity of the Enemy, & at the Risque of my Life & Fortune, & I may venture to say that the Weight & Burthen of the Public Affairs of that important County always has & still does in a great Measure rest upon my Shoulders.  In the Spring of 1776 I established a Hospital in Newark, at my own Expence, in which my Son & I carefully & successfully attended a great Number of Continental Patients, for which I have not received any Recompence.  In the Beginning of September 1776, I was appointed by Dr Morgan the then Director General as senior Surgeon in the General Hospital, & when the Sick were brought from New York to Newark by Order of the Commander in Chief & other Hospitals were erected there, I not only furnished all the Medicines, which my Son & I used, but all the other Gentlemen employed went to my Shop with as much Freedom, as they would have done to a Continental Store & made Use of the Medicines for the Continental Sick without Weight or Measure.  In the Retreat through Jersey I lost my all within Power of the Enemy & moved my Family to Baskenridge, where I established & maintained all Winter three Hospitals & chiefly at my own Expence.  When the Arrangement of the Medical Department was made in April 1777, I had the Honor of being appointed Physican & Surgeon General of the Army by Congress, in which Station I served faithfully untill the new Arrangement took Place, when I had the Mortification of being degraded in the Journals of Congress & held up to View in General Orders & in the Public Papers, as a common Surgeon of the Hospitalls, when it was known that I had for so long a Time been Physican & Surgeon Generl. of the Army while others were as publickly preferred to the Rank of chief Physicians & Surgeons.  It would be needless to observe that it must greatly hurt the Feelings of any Person of the least Sensibility or Delicacy of Sentiment to be  reduced while others are promoted & made subject to the Orders of an inferior Officer as I have been.  The Office of Chief Physician & Surgeon of the Army is vacant by the Promotion of Dr Cockran. It is the same Office, tho' under a somewhat different Title which I have held ever since Aprl. 1777 & no Person in your Service can pretend equal Claim to it.  I will only add that at the Beginning of this Controversy I was possessed of what was to me an Independent Fortune & in a Situation as easy & happy as I could wish & that is far otherwise with me now, owing to my engaging in the Cause & Service of my Country. I am with great Respect, your Excellency's most obedient humble Servant, Wm. Burnet  ""

Lee Had Made an attack on a party of his Cavalry and killed 13, & Taken 30 prisoners and Totaly defeated the Party-That Genl. Greene was Joined by 1300 Malitia MARCH 2, 1781  & 800 Riflemen-So that great things probably may be Accomplished there in a few days. I have Given My attendance all this week in Congress and have had an Opertunity of Seeing how essential it is for every State to keep up their representation There. Our State will find it Much More to their Interests To give Such a reasonable allowance as will enable their Delligates to Stay here, than to be unrepresented. Upon the Confederation being Confirmed New Hamshire & Rhode Island having each but one Member & therefore became unrepresented, they thought it so essential that they Moved Congress to adjourn appointing a Committee of the States to Sit Till they Could be represented.2 I do not Mention this because I wish them to enable me to Stay, but because I think they ought to Make it an essential point to be represented and that they May enable others To attend that I May attend My own interests at home for nothing that I would wish them to give would Compensate for My Staying. Yet I think it so necessary for the Interests of the State that I intend to give all the attendance in my power Till they git better Supplied.  Yesterday the Confederation was finally rattified and Confirmed. At Two OClock we had a Colation at the President of Congress's. At five I dined at Mr. McKeans with the President & Vice President and Sundry members of assembly of this State and Sundry Members of Congress & others. Thus you hear this Situation is not without the flattering inducements of Good Company & Good Living. But as have not yet had it in my power to git lodgings to My Mind, have not yet been waited on by the Minister of France Whose Custom it is to wait on every member of Congress as soon as he Takes lodgings.  As I may often Communicate to you many things which ought not to be publick I shall only request that you will always attend to such things as your own Judgment points out to be of that nature which may save me the Trouble of particularising them. I am Vizt.  Thomas Rodney N.B. I am much pleased to find that all your old acquaintances in Congress still profess the warmest Esteem for you. My love to Sally and all friends below.  ""

  Philadelphia March the 3d 1781 Did I, my Dr. general, consult forms in those attachments which my Judgment is proud in having adopted; this letter would contain little but appology in not having earlier acknowledged the oblidging favours with wich you have honoured me-My constitution is of a different mould. I could only therefore look forward to a character with veneration, which I could not pleasantly address: and amidst those publick and domestick troubles, which united to assail the virtuous mind; a hearty Sympathy was not the Smallest, among poor ornaments of my mind.  It is with uncommon satisfaction I See you rise Superior to the Throws of hazard, not overclouded by Strokes, which must have strong affected the parent & heretofore successful general. It gives a pre-eminence to that Station in which you was placed, When Congress bestowed with So much Justice, its highest honours and marks of Esteem on the victorious General at Saratoga.  Were we, in this contest for a republican Interest to preserve our apathy for the monarch under which we formerly lived; merely for the purpose of grasping honor of a similar and baser nature, how vain and mean would be the pursuit-but when Sentiments are founded on a conviction, that Despotism ought not to enter into Human Society or constitute any part of the government of civil rights-the Same generous ardor, which is engaged to extirpate it; will ever preserve a Jealousy to prevent it. This Jealousy must be considered, to Speak en militaire, the vide of Republican Safety.  Rumours from various parts are arrived-Count d'Estaing having captured Six british men of War, part of Commodore Hoods Squadron, and a very considerable number of transports off the western Islands, This may be true-Several other accounts from the Southwd. These you know, being not of a latter date, than when I heard from you.  The Marquis delaFayette, and a detachment of light infantry, from the whole of the N____ Army, passed by here two days Since; the object, Arnolds post; but the departure of the French Ship of War and frigates from Chesapeak for Rhode Island, will possibly convert it into a reinforcement to Genl Greene. The French Ships carried into Rhode Island ten prizes: of which two or three were Stout privateers, also the Romulus of 44 Guns & 500 British-this is certain.  The Confederation was finally ratified on Thursday last. Major Deveaux who intends shortly for Berkely county, will furnish me an opportunity of Writing more at large and commencing that regular correspondence from which I will draw much Satisfaction and use. MARCH 3, 1781  I am pleased with the Expectation of Seeing you in Philadelphia the beginning of April, by that time important Events will await our Southern operation.  Please to introduce my Respectful Complemts. to Mrs. Gates, and Believe me Dr. General, with much respect & attachment, yr. faithful & Obed. Serv, Richd Howly  ""

  Sir, Philadelphia 3d of March 1781.  In the begining of January last, before I left head Quarters, I advised the Commander in chief, to Send Brigadier General Knox of the Artillery to the four New-England States to allarm them on the defection of the Pennsylvania line, as well as to draw their attention by that event to the important military Concerns of the United States. The Brigadier is a man of Sense and observation, so that his Judgment may be relied on; and as he is a native of N.E. and well acquainted with the people of that Country and with the means of geting information, no question remains in my mind of the truth of the Communication he has made to me, of the result of His mission. To his report I can with great truth add that I am persuaded on the best evidence, that every man in the State of New York who were in earnest & risqued every thing in opposing the British Tyranny in the first Stage of the Contest, are now Zealously attached to the independency of America, and the Alliance.

  Dr. Sr. Philadelphia March 5th 1781 We have been for some days past in the most impatient expectation of hearing that the Virtue and ardor of our Countrymen had put a stop to the Progress of Cornwallis, and a period to his handfull of men with which that adventurous Knight Errand had dared to traverse the Southern States, and (as if bidding defiance to our Patriotism and Courage) has with three thousand troops thrown down the Gauntlet to forty thousand at least, who are nearer to him than he is to any support. Good God! Shall it be said that this man has dared to Venture near three Hundred miles from the Sea Coast and above two Hundred from any of his Posts and shall be permitted again to return! I cannot believe it. It is said we want Arms-Has not every Peasant in Virginia & North Carolina a Gun? with what weapons were the Battles of Bunkers Hill, Bennington and Kings mountain fought. But I will not dwell on a Subject which affords so much Chagrin. I will suppose that the Spirit of America has again roused and that Saratoga is revived at the Saura Town.(1) I have been unwearied in my applications for a Maritime force from Rhode Island and should in my last have informed you that I had at last obtained it through the French Ministery-but was afraid to trust it to paper as it was so profound a secret that no one in Philadelphia except him & myself knew it was saild untill we had reason to expect it had arrived. Altho it had not all the desired effect MARCH 5, 1781  it has at least been serviceable in transporting about eleven Hundred stand of Arms, some considerable Qy of Cloathing, Medcines & military stores, which were intended for Virginia, but taken, retaken and Carried into Rhode Island-which was done at the request of the delegates.(2) I can also assure you as a truth to be depended on that on their return to Rhode Island the French Squadron has taken the British Ship of War the Romulus-two large Privateers & eight other Vessels, which with five hundred Prisoners are safely arrived in Rhode Island-and before this arrives you will undoubtedly (without a sinister accident) be reinforced by 1000 Chosen Regular troops under the Command of the Marquis de lafayette. A British ship of the line which was missing in the late Storm is returned to Gardners Bay-which puts the two fleets on an equal footing & I suppose in the Judgement of the French Commr. renderd it necessary to recall their Ships from our Bay.  The Confederation was Signed and completely ratified on Thursday last, and was accompanied with every demonstration of Joy by all ranks of People in this Place. I thought I had acknowledged the Rect. of yrs. enclosing Col. Masons Sentiments.(3) I have little doubt of the Grants being accepted by Congress on the terms mentiond in the act of Cession which I see nearly corresponds with those in that Paper. I believe the Covert manoeuvres of the land Jobbing Companies are so well known, and so fully discoverd, that few of their abettors will be hardy enough to oppose it in its fullest latitude. Congress seems at this time more Unanimous, and less torn by factions than (from the best Information I can obtain from the oldest Members) it has ever been since its first meeting. I am clearly of opinion if the Intelligence you give of the hostility of the British against the Danish Ships be true; that the next Spring must unfold the designs of the Armd neutrality [to] their fullest extent and that Britain's Sun of Glory will set in the ocean never to rise again. We have a report-which comes from the Havannah-Martinique, & Hispaniola to Boston in short Passages that D'Estaing has taken six of Admiral Hoods Squadron of the line & three frigates & forty five of his Convoy for the West Indies. This is all the news at pr[esent] Current. You will be pleased to offer my respects to your Brother Arthur, from whom I have in vain expected a letter for some time past. I am happy to hear he is well. We are informd that the assembly has voted three Pounds Virginia Currency per day for the delegates. If so, I can assure you it will bring such as have families, and live in any manner suitable to their station, with the Utmost oeconomy, above one Hundred Pounds per Annum in debt, exclusive of traveling home once a year which is a recess from business. I think not unreasonable. I hope by the next Post to have my acct. of expenditures made out, ready to be laid before the assembly. Adieu & believe me to be Dr. Sr., Yr. most obet. Set.

Hands or to Mrs. S A Otis. Mrs. Lovell, in opening a small Bag will find a Bundle in brick colored Paper for you. I put up yr. damaged Cambrick and your undamaged silk Handkerchief with yr. injured muslin dos. I could not impose anything more on the Doctors Goodness than what I have done or I would have added something belonging to you with a few Articles for Mr. Cranch. I will omit no good Opportunity of sending the whole.  We have nothing of Decision from the southward that can be depended on; for, tho' Govr. Jefferson writes on the 26th that Cornwallis was retreating as rapidly as he had advanced, yet he mixes some Circumstances that we know are not true. Genl. Green wrote on the 15 that he himself had crossed the Dan without any Loss of Men or Baggage, but that he was not in condition to oppose the Enemy at all the Fords which would that Evening be passable and therefore he should not attempt to do it at any-that the militia were not coming to reinforce him and some were even leaving him-that his own Troops were in fine Spirits though they might be tracked by their bloody Feet. Govr. Jefferson says Cornwallis was retreating towards Hilsborough, and that Genl. Caswell was in his Rear with 4000. I think this probable from knowing Caswell's Influence; but it is a vi[le] toryish Country from Hilsborough to Cape Fear so that the 4000 will not grow. The Enemy are 3,250, but, if actually on the Retreat, the Hessian Brigade will as usual lose mach of its Strength by Desertions.  MARCH 5, 1781  Mulenberg was within 4 miles of Newport with 4,000 and his advance within 1/4 mile he had two mortars and had picked off several Centinels and taken some Waggons. He thinks he shall be able to give a good account of Arnold. Baron Steuben had left that Quarter, and gone with 500 Continentals and some Rifle Men to strengthen Genl. Green.

  Munday March 5th 1781. When we came to do business this Morning it was proposed by the President that Congress Should determine What number of States in Congress assemblad are Competent to do business. This brought on a long and Learned debate. It was Argued by Mr. Duane of N.Y., Mr. of Connecticut,(1) Mr. Madison of Virginia, Mr. Lovel, of Masachusets, Mr. Root (2) & Mr. Witherspoon of Jersey and Mr. McKean of Delaware-That, as the Confederation had enumerated Sundry things Which Should Not be done but by the Assent of nine States-And that no other question (except for Adjourning from day to day) Should be determined unless by the Votes of a Majority of the United States in Congress Assembled.(3) It was evident that the MARCH 5, 1781  Confederation intended nine States Should be a Corum to do business and that a Majority of the nine (vizt. five) was Sufficient to determine any matter Except the matters enumerated as above mentioned. That unless this Construction was put on the Clause Would not be able to do much And Instances of the Practice of the Brittish Parliament and that of Corporations Were introducd to inforce these Arguments. And much fine reasoning and Sophistry Not much to the Honour or Credits of those on this Side of the question Was made use of-And indeed no Species of artful reasoning Within the reach of a Law[y]er was left untried on this Occasion. Here we had an opertunity of Seeing that maxim Verified \""that all men would be Tyrants if they Could git the power\"" And I must Confess I was Sorry to See Such a keen Strugle to increase the power of Congress beyond What the States Intended, so early as but the third day after Completing the Confederation. But all their Arguments were so fully answered by Mr. Burk of N. Carolina-that Mr. (4) of Connecticut came over to the Same opinion. Mr. Burk Contended that the assent of Seven States (a Majority of the united States) Was necessary to determine every question in Congress except adjourning. He said he well remembered the Arguments, and the gentlemen who advanced them on this Subject, When the Confederation was framed; that the matter was then fully debated and that it was the Sense of Congress at that time that less than a Majority of the States Should not determine any question in Congress-that Majority at present is Seven, but that the reason why Congress Chose to Mention the Majority instead of the number Seven Which at present is a Majority Was because they expected that Canada Would Acceed to the Confederation, and in that Case Seven Would have Ceased to be the Majority-And that the Clause was in Such plain and explicit language that he Could not See how it Should or Could be Understood other Ways. That if the Matter was determined otherwise, it Would put it in the power of a minority of five States by entering into a junto or Cabal To ruin the Majority of Eight. That it was Contrary to all Compacts of Sivil Society for the Minority to rule the Majority but that if this questioned was determined as the other gentlemen Wished, it would often be the Case in the united States, Whenever it hapen'd that two or more of the States Were not represented in Congress. But he Said let Congress pretend to determine as they Would they Could not destroy the force of the Confeder[ation] that if they attempted so early to Claim powers that were not expressly given by that Charter or began to pervert it to increas their power they Would give a dreadful alarm to their Constituents Who are so Jealous of their Liberty. Col. Blann of Virginia, Mr. Mathews of S. Carolina coincided with Mr. Burke. But the oposite party replied that the Clause Could not mean A majority of all the United States but that the plain   and Obvious Meaning of the Word was a Majority of Such States as Should be from time to time represented in Congress. Thus All the Stress of the Argument on their Side lay in the Construction of the following Words To wit \""A Majority of the United States in Congress Assembled.\"" South Carolina mistaking the plain Meaning of these words as Well as Some of the present disputants instructed their Deligates to git the Words \""in Congress assembled\"" Struck out And then they alledged there Would remain no doubt, but if they had fully attended to the Whole intention of this Sentence they Would have Seen that this Would have distroyed one half and More of its true Meaning, and thereby have left one half the Confederation out of the power of Congress. Now I Conceive this Sentence includes Two things vizt. That every question Not requiring the Assent of nine States, Should require the assent of a Majority of the United States, (Which While there remains only thirteen will always be Seven) and that this Assent Should be given in Congress, and no Where else-but if the Words \""in Congress Assembled\"" were Struck out, that assent Could not be given in Congress at all; and therefore When Any Question arose in Congress that Should require Such assent, they would be under the necessaty of sendg. to each State for its Vote, and have to Wait till it was Convenient for the Legislatures to determine the Mater And Send up their Voices to Congress-And in My Humble Opinion if the Words \""in Congress assembled\"" were Struck out of the Confederation, they would Carry with them one half the powers of Congress because they relate to almost every question that requires the voice of a Majority of the States, if not to those or at least Some of them that requires the assent of nine States.

  My dear Sir Philada March 6 1781 I had Yesterday the Pleasure of receiving your Letter of 21 Feby by the Post. The Attention you have given to my recommendation of Major Clarkson (1) is very obliging. Besides his Merit as an officer, I confess, a Desire that all Strangers of Reputation should meet with Hospitality in Boston, has moved me to make that gentleman as well as others known to my Friends there. Some Persons who have not been acquainted with that City have imbibd an Opinion of the Inhabitants as being illiberal, severe & inhospitable. I cannot imagine what could give Rise to this opinion, for I have always thought they deservd a different Character, and it has gratified me much to hear it said by Gentlemen who have made a Tour that Way that the People are remarkeably civil & polite. It may be a Peice of good Breeding in my Friends to speak as handsomely as they can, to me of my native Town. They indeed often tell me that I discover a Partiality in nothing so much as in regard to the Citizens of that Place. I own there may be some Grounds for their thinking so, for I am sensible of the strongest Attachment & the warmest Affection, & those Feelings a Man cannot easily hide. I hope there will always be found in Boston, at least as much Urbanity as in any other City, in the Judgment of Men of true Taste, but I wish the Time may never come when his Manners shall be such as to recommend them to the unprincipled & profligate.  I thank you for your kind Intention of sending me a Quintal of fish. It would have been Luxury to our Southern Friends, but as I design very soon to return to Boston, I shall not have the pleasure of partaking of it with them.  I really think you have been hardly dealt with, in the Instance you mention in your Letter. It is difficult always to account for the opinions of Men even in Matters which nearly affect the Interest of Individuals. I am affraid mistaken Principles have been adopted to your Prejudice which may hereafter appear when it may be impracticable to do you Justice.  Inclosd is the Newspaper of the Day.

  Philadelphia 6th March 1781 I recevd my dearest polly, your affectionate Letter by this days post. The Circumstances of our publick Affairs have demanded the Attention of every man in publick Trust, in an eminent degree, especially of those whose long experience in business has acquired them Confidence and the Means of being useful. It must be obvious to you that we must be ruined unless a Successful period is put to the MARCH 6, 1781  War; and my Interest as well as duty call upon me to contribute my Services. But remember my dearest polly that I did not engage in the delegation of this present critical year but with your own free approbation; for I foresaw that the Common Interest as well as the particular business of our own State woud involve me in a Scene which must bring on a long and to both us a most painful Seperation. It has been much alleviated by the Visit of our daughter which enabled me to introduce her into the world and give her some opportunity of being polished before habit had extended on her a fixed Awkwardness which is always the Attendant of a Country Life. And I flattered myself that you was as much engaged in this Reflection as myself. It at the same time has encreased the difficulty of my Return; for I must repeat it that this depends on a favorable opportunity having no Carriage for a young Lady's accommodation of my own: And If I had the Roads must be consulted. I feel my dearest Polly the force of your observation that \""altho' the State requires my Assistance, I have a tender and affectionate wife and a young Family who require my care.\"" But what can I do? You know I never sought publick Employment. When called upon by the Voice of my Country coud I refuse in a Cause which my Conscience approved? If I give up my present Station can I, ought I, to remain a Silent Spectator! No-An Active part I must take either in Council or the Field. Do not then, my dearest polly, repine at what cannot be prevented, but submit as chearfully as possible to our present Lot. If you saw the unhappy People who have fled from Georgia, South Carolina and our own State who have left their Families at the mercy of the Enemy you would still think our Situation not intolerable In Comparison with their's. Indeed ours is sufficiently unhappy, and whatever may be thought of a Residence in a gay City no Consideration but the dangerous Situation of our Country in the Disasters of which our own immediate Ruin is involved coud reconcile it to my feelings.  You know the Integrity of my Heart and the Candor of my Mind; and you may rest assured that it is impossible you can wish more ardently for my return than I do to embrace my dearest polly and our beloved Children. I am pleased with our Son's proficiency. I have in a late Letter told you how much I lament the Loss of his preceptor. What you mention of our little darling pleases me. Why did you not say something of our Sally? But I am happy to know she is well. I much approve of your retaining the Nurse. And I entreat you not, by any means, to dismiss her. We shall find means to make it her Interest to continue her Charge when I return home. You are Anxious to know when that will be and I will satisfy you as well as I can. Brother Robert and his Lady will set out in the Course of five or six weeks and I mean to accompany them-and shall by degrees withdraw myself from Business to be prepared for that Event. Harry   will I suppose accompany us-if he does not entangle himself with the Ladies for he is a Favorite.  Our Southern affairs wear a promising Aspect. Lord Cornwallis is retreating after a rapid march in pursuit of the Prisoners taken from his Army by General Morgan to no purpose. There is the greatest probability that he will share the Fate of Burgoine. Arnold who is Entrenched at Portsmouth in Virginia appears to be in greater danger: but we must wait the Events of War in anxious Sollitude.  Cornwallis followed General Green's small Army which has been assembling since Gates's defeat upwards of 330 or 340 miles, from Cambden in South Carolina to the Borders of Virginia. The Retreat of Greene gave the Militia an Opportunity of Collecting, And they were becoming formidable. Cornwallis now saw his danger and retreated back as fast as possible and General Greene with his Army and the militia are in pursuite of him, and he has besides a large body of militia in his front who will interrupt his progress. So soon has the Scene changed and such is the Fortune of War!  Our daughter is in good health. She Joins me in wishing sincerely to be with you and in affectionate Respects to all our Friends. Kiss and bless for us our dear Children; And believe that no Absence or distance will abate the unalterable Affection and Fidelity of my dearest Polly, your Affect. Husband,  Jas. Duane (1)  ""

  Sir, Philadelphia March 6th. 1781.  Miss Livingston (1) informed me a few days ago, that in a letter she received from you, you mention you had received no answer from  MARCH 6, 1781  me to yours, inclosing a letter for Mr. Dumas. This is extraordinary, as I wrote to you, the first post after the receipt of that letter.(2) But this conveyance is at present, so ill managed, that it is by no means to be depended on. One of my letters I lately wrote to the southward, has also been miscarried. The public is at a most enormous expense in supporting the post office, but it appears to me that they derive very little benefit from it. However, sir, this accident shall not discourage me from troubling with a few lines whenever any thing turns up worthy your notice.  Our preperations for a final ratification of the Confederation, have suspended for a time our plan of finance. Our constitution being so materially changed, that we have felt a little awkward in our new gears; however we have got pretty well used to them now, & have again entered on business.  I hope our new constitution will prove the means of introducing a more clear & perfect understanding between Congress & the States. And whilst the first continue to confine themselves within the strict limits of their authority, the latter will conceive themselves bound by the most sacred ties implicitly to support them. The want, hitherto, of a proper line to be drawn between Congress, & the states, has been the cause of numberless embarrassments: for whilst the States were left ad libitum, some would do a great deal, some a little, & others scarcely anything. The evil consequences resulting from this conduct are apparent. My expectations are highly flattered by this important event, & anticipate in my own mind the most happy consequences resulting from it.  The return of the French fleet to Rhode Island I suppose you are acquainted with. This must of course frustrate the Marquis's expedition.  We have not heard from the southward since the 10th ulto. but we are in hourly expectation of an express from thence. We have just received dispatches from the So. ward which inform us, that Cornwallis is retreating, that Genl. Caswell had collected 4000 North Carolina Militia in his front, & 6000 Virginians were in his rear. This looks well, & probably some important stroke may be made at him before he gets back. Genls. Mughlenburgh & Nelson was laying close siege to Arnold at Portsmouth with 4500 men. They had advanced to within a mile of his works with two mortars.  Their advanced posts were within a qr. of a mile of each other-but the dog can get away by means of his shipping, unless the French fleet can prevent him. I am Dr. sir, with the most perfect Esteem Regard, yr. most Obedt. Servt. Jno. Mathews  ""

  My Dear sir, Philadelphia March 6th. 1781  I received your favor of the 26th Ulto. the 1st inst.(1) In answer thereto, I beg leave to observe, That all the gentlemen now prisoners at St. Augustine, were either acting as officers in the militia; or as private soldiers, at the time they were made prisoners. And I cannot conceive they can be looked upon, in any other light, than that in which they acted at the time of their captivity. Indeed by the capitulation of Charles Town, this is a point clearly decided. I conceive when the people of a country, lay aside the characters of citizens, and assume that of soldiers, through the whole course of the accidents of war, they are to be considered according to their military rank only, that of the citizen being absorbed in that of the soldier.  For instance, all the British officers taken in America, who have been members of their parliament, or House of Lords, have not been considered as such, at the time of exchange, but simply in the ranks they have held in their army. Genl. Burgoyne was a Governor, he was never considered in all the Cartels that have been propos'd in any other light than as a Genl. officer. Several other officers, I believe, have held civil commissions, independent of their seats in parliament.  From these considerations, I cannot think Sr. Henry Clinton, can have an Idea of holding those gentlemen at St. Augustine, by any other characters than those they respectively held in the military line at the time of their capture. Should your Excellency find this objection started by Sr. H. Clinton, in the course of your negotiations, I think Congress should be immediately acquainted with it, that they might be enabled to take their measures accordingly.  If they can bring any criminal charge against those gentlemen, let them exhibit them. And if the charge is proved, they must suffer, if not, it is high time, that justice should be done them. Congress cannot with honor, longer delay it. A speedy exchange, has hitherto been the only cause of it's being suspended.  I am, Dear sir, with the highest respect & every sentiment of the most sincere Esteem & regard, yr. Excys. most Obedt. servt.  Jno. Mathews ""

  Tuesday March 6th 1781. This Morning the Subject So Much debated Yesterday Came on the Carpet again (1)-but all the Members being Tired out With the debate and Concluding it Would be unsafe To Make any final determination on a Matter which So Materially affects the freedom and Sovereignty of the respective States Generally Agreed that the Rule of their Conduct Should be Not to go upon any business but When Nine States at least are represented in Congress-And Not to pass any Vote but with the assent of Seven States at least Untill otherwise Determined, When all the States are represented-and upon this Rule we proceeded to business.  The Deligates of N.Y. Moved that the memorial from there State Should be Taken up Which requested that Congress Would recommend it to the respective States To repeal all Laws Making paper Money Legal Tender, or that they Would permit that State to pay of the Certificates Which had been given for Supplies With the New Money-or that they Would furnish Money to pay of those Certificates &c. or that they Might be ordered to Exchange the New Money for the Old &c.(2) Doctr. Weatherspoon opposed this Motion and Said that it Tended to increas the paper Money in Circulation if they were permitted to pay of the Certificates in that way-And a member from Connecticut (3) Observed that they had Called in all the Old Money in that State by Tax-and it Would be hard Now that it Was in great part Collected that they Should be Obliged on Account of New Yorks Application To give the New Money out for the Old, which would be Taking to Much from the Treasury-And oblige them to be at the Expence and delay of Collecting another Tax as the old Money Must be distroyed and wou'd Serve to pay the army or purchase Supplies-postponed Till Tomorrow.  General Vernon of Rhode Island, Then Moved that Congress Should appoint a Committee to Draw up a Code of Laws giving Congress full power to punnish All their Own officers And that it Should be recommended to The United States to Confirm the same. This Motion was at first opposed but the Committee was afterwards agreed to & the Debate reserved Till they Report (4)-another Grasp.  ""

This Comes by a Letter from the Governor of Virginia & is Confirmed by a number of others all Dated the 26th of Feby.(3) They all agree that his retreat began the Twenty first of Feby and I have no reason to Doubt but I have Some Apprehensions that this is a Maneuvre to bring General Green to an Action.

I am happy to find your Excellency Entertains the Same Sentiments of the virtues and abilities of Colo Hamilton, as I have Ever Done myself.(2) After I wrote your Excellency I found The Eyes of Congress Turned on Robert Morris of this City as Financier. I did not therefore nominate Colo Hamilton as I foresaw that it would be but a vain attempt. I Shall this Day nominate him as Secretary of Foreign Affairs on which I Think I Shall meet the Approbation of most of the States.(3) The Choice of a Minister of war is postponed to the first of October. This was a Maneuvre of Saml Adams & others from the North, fearing that as I was in nomination, the Choice would fall on me who having apostatized from the True New England Faith by Sometimes voting with the Southern States am not Eligible. They were not however acquainted with all the Circumstances. I was nominated against my will & if Chosen Should not have Accepted.(4)  General Mc Dougle is appointed minister of marine.(5) The plan of Finance & all other matters go on So Slowly that I Tremble at the Consequence. I am mortified at the useless harangues which Consume our Time to no purpose. I am now Endeavoring to obtain an Adjournment of Congress & for Leaving a Committee to Transact the Business as the only way of having the Publick Business Done with propriety and Dispatch.(6) I fully agree with your Excellency That Congress ought to have more power but I also think that the old members Should be in Heaven or at Home before this Takes place.  The Traffic carried on with the Enemy is alarming as it not only Serves to furnish them with necessaries but Tends to reconcile our Citizens to the Idea of renewing their Connection with Great Britain and of Course Disaffects them to our Government.  Since General Greens Letter of the 15th February we have received advices from Governor Jefferson & Divers others that Cornwallis is retreating that General Green Crossed the River in pursuit of him the 21st & that the Militia had Collected all round him: I hope it is not a Maneuvre to bring General Green to an Action.

  Dear Sir Philadelphia March 6th 1781 As I mentioned to you in Former Letters my Suspicions respecting Colo Olcutts (1) being Either a Friend to New York or at best a mistaken one on the part of New Hampshire I now take the Liberty of inclosing you Copy of his Petition to Congress Delivered in Feby. 1780 Signed by him and Bezal. Woodward; by which it will appear that he was one of the first if not the very first mover for Taking away a great part of New Hampshire and annexing it to New York.(2) This together with his Joining with New York in having their favorite Question determined would alone have been Sufficient to place him in a Suspicious point of Light: but I had other Reasons. This will Easily Account for his not being able to Collect any real Sentiment respecting Vermont & for my Conversing with him in a manner which appeared most Likely to Draw forth his real Sentiments. I am no Less mortified Than Surprised that this Should be Looked upon by the assembly as a breach of Trust or a Deviation from my Instrictions (which I have Learned by Private Letters from New Hampshire). The Events which have already taken place by pursuing his Plan & the Reasoning in my Late Letters will Either Serve to Justify or Condemn the measures which I have Adopted. The Least attention to the Resolves of Congress will prove at Least how much it would be against the Interest of New Hampshire to have the Question respecting the Independency of Vermont first Determined, for Congress Long Since Resolved That The Inhabitants of that Territory Should Submit to the Jurisdiction they were under before the Commencement of the War. Now the Decree of the King and Council having given New York the Jurisdiction in 1764 & New Hampshire not assuming a Jurisdiction over them afterward it is inevitable that that resolution if Complied with would have placed those people under the Jurisdiction of New York. And if this Question So warmly argued by New York is first Determined a Decision making it Independent will Destroy the Claims both of New York & New Hampshire. But if the Determination Should be That it is not & Shall not be an Independent State will not the Decree of the King and Council & the former Resolution of Congress operate to fix them to New York untill New Hampshire by wading through a Tedious Dispute can Convince Congress or at Least a Committee of it That the Decree of 1764 was Erroneous. This will Throw the Onus upon New Hampshire and perhaps a Final Decision will be Delayed untill the Art of New York in the Exercise of their power reconciles the minds of the People to their Government-& renders an Acquisition of this Territory to New Hampshire more Difficult.  These are my Sentiments respecting the views of New York (3) & the MARCH 6, 1781  Design, or, mistake of Colo Olcutt-perhaps I may be mistaken but the reasons are Submitted to the wisdom of the assembly.  I do not mention These things to [hold] up the Idea of Deviating in the Least [degree] from my Late Instructions but as a Justification of my Conduct prior to the receipt of my Late Instructions.(4)  I have the honor to be, with respect your most obedient Servant,  Jno.

Upon enquiry into the Journals of Congress it appear'd that the States Were at Liberty to exchange the new Money for the Old at any exchange not less than 40 Old Dollars for One new one So that the Motion Was reduced to this-\""Will Congress give the State of N. York permission to pay of[f] the Certificates in that State with the new Money?\"" (2) Mr. Burk & Mr. McKean Urged that to permit this Would be Subverting the Intention of the Resolution of the 18th of March Unless the Old Money Was first drawn in. Mr. Weatherspoon & Mr. Bland Spoke to the Same purpose. Mr. Duane Said that it was out of the Power of N. York to call in the Old Money by exchange or Taxes because it Was Not in the State-That the inhabitants had let the Army have all their produce, for Which they only recd. Certificates-So that now they had neither Money nor produce to git it with, That these  MARCH 8, 1781  Certificates Amounted to Two Millions And that the faith of the State was pledged to pay them off-And if Congress Could not furnish Money to pay them the State would be Under the Necessaty of Striking Money on its Own Credit to pay them-That the State had alway Sacredly followed the Councils of Congress and had Complied With every requisition to the Utmost of their power, and Would not now do any thing without first having the Advice of Congress-That he Understood the State of Virginia had struck Two Millions of New Money on the Credit of that State contrary to the Resolution of the 18th of March.  He was Seconded by Genl Sullivan & Mr. Root of Jersey (3) Who insisted on permission for useing the new Money to pay of those Certificates &c.  But Mr. Burk replied and urged the keeping of the publick faith as held forth in the Resolution of the 18th of March-So that When the question Was put it passed in the negative.  A long debate also arose to day on a report of the Treasury board-Whether Congress Should pay Sundry Iron Masters for Shot and Shells on Bills on France at 4/6 Specie for 4/6 Sterling. Genl.

Pickerings Letter informing Congress that the Tender Laws put it out of his power To pay his Specie Contracts according to their real value in Current Money.(1)  The Whole Congress at once agreed that We ought to pay all our debts Honestly and that the Tender laws obliging people To Take paper Money at a rate above its Current Value was pernishous. Yet MARCH 8, 1781  a very long debate ensued. Some few only were against recommending it to the States to repeal all their Tender Laws thinking it would give a fatal Stab to the new Money. All the rest were for having this done and for paying our debts Honestly, but Could not agree in the Manner of doing it, So that the Whole day was Taken up in debating about the form of a Resolution Suited to the Occasion and one form after another was voted out Till all the parties got bewildered in the debate and at length Adjourned desiring that Some Member Would have one ready against the Morning Whereupon I Took upon me to prepair the following Resolutions Vizt.(2)  \""Whereas the United States in Congress Assembled, being Convinced that Honesty is the best police in publick, as well as private, affairs are determined to conform faithfully To the Golden rule of Equity & Justice-Therefore  Resolved that all the debts and Contracts now due, or which May hereafter become due from the United States, to any person or persons whatsoever (being first liquidated according to the real value of the Money Lent or Contracted for, at the Time of Lending or Contracting) Shall be paid in Specie or an equivalent in paper Money, Computed at its current not legal Value When paid: Any thing heretofore done to the Contrary notwithstanding.

  [post March 8, 1781] (1) Caractors of Some of the Members of Congress.  His Excellency Samuel Huntington President is a Man of a Mild, Steady & firm Conduct and of Sound & Methodical Judgment tho MARCH 8, 1781  not a Man of Many Words or very Shining abilities. But upon the Whole is better Suted to Preside than any other Member Now in Congress. In his Dress & Manners, he is very plain, very gentlemany and Truely republican. He is from Connecticut.  General Sulivan, of Newhamshire has been in the Army from the beginning of the War, has a good Idea of Publick affairs-is of Honest Political Sentiments, desirous of Supporting the credit of the States, and doing Justice to their Servants-he is generally cool & firm with an appearance of diffidence in debate, generally keeps to the point in question, but does not possess any great poli[ti]cally abilities; Such as are necessary To Take into view Such an Extensive Systematical arrangement of things as is Necessary in So extensive a government.  Samuel Adams of Massachusetts has been in Congress from their first Meeting has a pretty general knowledge of their affairs and is particularly attentive to every thing that affects his own State or friends; he is neither elloquent nor Talkative; but having the full command of his passions, and possessing a great deal of caution and Court cunning he is fitted for a politician in every Case Where great and good abilities are not requisite.  General Varnum of Rhode Island is a Man about Thirty, of florid habits-he has read Some little in books, is fond of Speaking & Spouting out every thing that his reading has furnished him With Whether apt or not to the purpose-his Temper & Councils are very precipate and but little calculated to be useful in Such an Assembly, he is very desirous of inlarging its powers.  Mr. (2) Of Connecticut appears To be a man of Integrity, is very candid in debate & open to Conviction and does not want abilities; but does not appear to be possessed of Much political knowledge.  Mr. Duane of New York has been in Congress from the first-Is of good & even Temper, Attentive To business, of a low soft Voice, not Elloquent, nor designing, but upon the Whole a good republican, desirous of promoting the general Weal and particularly attached to the Interests of his Own State.  Doctr. Weather Spoon of New Jersy is A man in years perhaps 70 of the New light Presbeterian Order-Is possessed of a good Share of knowledge in books and the Languages; Speaks With a low and broken Voice in the Scotch Accent; And has all the design and arch Cuning that is necessary or practiced in an assembly of the kirk of Scotland-But does not seem To possess Much of that Candid integrity, Honesty & Wisdom Which is necessary in the Governing an Honest Confederacy.  Mr. Root-of Jersy (3) is a Man that Seems to be Without passions and therefore has a Capacity to Conceal the Most artful designs under the Most Specious Shew of Candor, and plausible Arguments yet his language is So Weak & innervate that he Seldom Succeeds in  Making Much impression on the Audience-in Short his Talents Seem better Suted to Some under office of Some European Court than To a republican Assembly.  Doctr. Montgomery of Pensylvania is a Man possessed of a good Share of reading and knowledge & is an Agreeable companion in private-has an apt Memory and a fertile imagination-Yet is Vain, fond of power & governed in publick Council by capricious Whims.  Mr. McKean of Dalaware, now Chief Justice of Pensylvania-has been in Congress from the first-is a Man of Talants-of great Vanity, extremely fond of power & entirely governed by passions, ever pursuing the Object present With Warm enthusiastic Zeal Without Much reflection or forecast.  There is none from Maryland that may be particularly distinguished at present.(4) Therefore I Take notice of a Mr. Madison of Virginia, Who with some little reading in the Law is Just from the College, and possesses all the Self conceit that is Common To youth and inexperience in like cases-but it is unattended with that gracefulness & ease which Sometimes Makes even the impertinence of youth and inexperience agreeable or at least not offensive.  Col. Blann (5) of Virginia is a Man of Moderate Talents, of firmness & Candor and Much Attached To the Constitution of the States- Tho not very Systematical nor always of the best Judgment and is rather rustic in debate.  Doctr. Burk, of N. Carolina, tho not equal To Many Who have been in Congress, May Justly be Stiled the ablest And Most useful Member there at present. He has been in Congress five Years, is very Attentive and well Acquainted with business-is Nervous tho Not Eloquent in his language, he is Correct and pointed in his debates, possesses the Honest integrity of a republican and is for preserving inviolable the rights of the people Without being lured away by power-Yet he is Some times not fully guarded from Dictatorial language and does not Attend Sufficiently To System, order and Arrangement, in a general view but Confines himself Too Much To particular Objects.  Governor Bee of South Carolina, is a Man of Some Talents, of a cruid restive Temper, not Eloquent but of a harsh & disagreeable dilivery; consiquensial in his deportment and Conceited in his notions-very desirous of Order in the House, but Most abt to transgress it himself.  Mr. Mathews Chief Justice of S. Carolina, is a Man of Tallants and More Agreable in his Address as well as language-but has an interuptive Maner of Speaking not Well adapted to Command attention-is undesigning and possesses a goodeal of Candor, Which leaves him open To Conviction-and upon the Whole is a good republican.   Governor Howley of Georgia is a Man of great reading and knowledge Which he generally displays without System or design Staying far from the object in question, so that he often leaves it in doubt What side of the question he is on. He is loud but not very eloquent, therefore rather excels in Declamation than Argument- and of course is not Closely attended to-but when he entertains the House With Strokes of Wit or Spouts of knowledge. He would Shine more in a Democratic assembly.  The rest of the House May be Thrown into one Group of inferior Talants, Mostly young, inexperienced, & unconnected in any regular political Views.  The Judicious Will See by this exhibition of Caractors-That the affairs of the United States in Congress are not Conducted by the ablest Talants and Men of the first Abilities, therefore Will Not be found agreable to the rules of unexceptionable Wisdom. Neither are they Conducted by the Most True, disinterested & amiable Spirit of Patriotism. Yet Congress Considered Collectively possesses a firm & Independant Spirit-With a determined & Unalterable resolution To Support the liberties of America. And the selfish Conceit and Opinions Which Most of the Members possess has in Some Measure the effect of the Most disinterested Patriotism, because it occasions them To disagree in every thing but those measures Which is notoriously for the good of all. Yet this disjointed manner of proceeding throws government into that disorder'd Tract of adopting one expedient after another perpetually by Which Means the States have lost their Credit, and Congress that Confidence which the People ought to have in their Wisdom.  Therefore it is To be wished That Congress Would ad System, order and arrangement Well Organized, To the Honesty and integrity of their Measures-And I trust now that the respective powers of Congress and the States are prescribed & Marked out, these improvements will soon begin to Take place.  Indeed it is not much to be Wondered at that this has not Taken place before. Such a Variety of interests as their Must be among a people forming thirteen Independant States extended over a vast Tract of Country, and only connected by political Ties, requires Much Time & experience To reduce them To Systematical order, and so To Organize and arrange them as to be Sutable and agreable To a people So jealous of their Liberties as the Americans are-And So as to give no reason of complaint to one part of the Community against another.  But I am pursuaded a Noble, Honest And generous love for Mankind, United With a firm and unalterable attachment for our Country, Together With a Virtuous Mind, relying in the favour and blessings of Providence Will lead us To this at last-And by its  Success convince the world of the Justice and uprightness of our Cause.

  Sir March 8th, 1781. At a Time when Congress have affairs of great Public importance before them, some apology is necessary for taking up a moment of their Time with the concerns of an individual, and I hope my particular situation will plead my excuse especially as I shall put this application on such a footing as to preclude all debate.  Near three years ago I was, without my knowledge appointed an assistant Deputy Quarter Master General on the Communication to Fort Pitt, & the appointment was made in such a manner that I thought myself obliged to accept of it altho' it interferred with my private business, & would not have been my choice if it had not. Last spring a Company of Artillery were added to Fort Pitt, with a Quantity of Military and other Stores under their Care. There was an urgent request from the Board of War to the Quarter Masters on the Line to forward them to the utmost of their Power, tho there was great difficulty in complying with this request, as we not only had no Money; but were greatly in Debt, and not having paid according to our Contract no Person would give us credit on the Public acount- the consequence of which was that not only that Company & those Stores; but also the Stores that were sent up the Pennsylvania Road & were detained all winter by the deep Snow; would have remained where they were, altho the army under Col. Broadhead were in the utmost distress for the want of them, had I not borrowed Money & given my personal security, to forward them, as well as to defray the expences of the Detachment that was sent down to guard the Stores detained on the Pennsylvania Road all winter-as the forwarding these Stores had been so warmly urged by the Board of War & as I knew the absolute necessity there was that this Should be done without delay, I hesitated not a moment. But I will candidly confess that had I believed I should have been put to such difficulty in being  MARCH 8, 1781  reimbursed the Money & in paying what I had borrowed, I perhaps should not have been so ready in running the risque. I came down in the summer to settle my accounts, & if I could not obtain any other part of the Ballance due, I fully expected this; but herein I was disappointed for after waiting a considerable Time I could get nothing done-unless spending more Money in looking after this may be thought forwarding the business. It is true I obtained a recommendation from the Board of War to the Treasury, in consequence of which the following Resolve passed Congress Augt. 30th 1780. viz.  \""That on the application of Charles Pettit A.Q.M.G. on Account of Major Genl Greene late Q.M.G. a Warrant issue in his favour for thirty thousand Dollars to repay a like sum borrowed by Col. Thos. Smith ADQMG to enable him to forward the Stores & Artillery under the direction of Capt. Craig to Fort Pitt & for which the said Major Genl. Greene late QMG is to be accountable.\"" The Warrant issued but I have not yet obtained the Money nor do I know when I shall-the consequence was that being determined to comply faithfully with my Contracts I sold a Tract of Land & paid the whole I had borrowed: of other Debts due to me, I should blush even to give a hint that I wished any preference, while I have the honour of a seat in Congress; and as for Wages as it was not for the sake of any that I undertook the business, my demand on that account shall be one of the last made for similar services. I think it an honour that I have impaired my private Estate while in public service even tho' I had a very beneficial Practice, at a Time when others who had no Estates have created large ones-under these circumstances, I submit to the consideration of Congress the propriety of ordering a Warrant to Issue in my favour on Thomas Smith Commissioner &c for 750 Dollars of the new Emissions as an Equivalent for the said Warrant being 1 for 40, which will be far from being of equal value to me as the service mentioned in the first warrant would have been had I obtained it when I ought; nor will it be of one third part of the value of the Land I parted with by reason of my not obtaining it. The justice of this request will be acknowledged by all-but if it should be thought not consistent with Policy as well as founded in justice & equity, I wish not to have it complyed with. My feelings would be more hurt by having any preference, than by having my request rejected-for this reason I have not spoke to any of the honourable Members to say a word on the subject-and I now request your Excellency, that if it causes a minutes Debate you will on my behalf withdraw this application.(1)  I have the honour to be, your Excellency's most obedient and very humble servant,  Thomas Smith  ""

I moved That previous to its being Considered it might be refered to your Excellency for your opinion upon which it was recommitted; and The Committee Instructed to Consult your Excellency upon it. I Therefore take the Liberty of Inclosing your Excellency a Copy of the Report and of requesting (in behalf of the Committee) your opinion upon it.  The first Paragraph is agreeable to the Line of promotion which your Excellency was pleased to point out: But as it could not be Extended to Hazens Regiment & others in Similar Circumstances the 2d Resolution became Necessary.  The Third & fourth respecting the Artillery and Cavalry are Liable to Some objections but much Less so than any other which Suggested themselves to the Committee.  The Promotion of Brigadiers & Major Generals comes nearer to that of rising in the Line of the Army than any which has yet been Adopted or Suggested, and any other would be attended with Insuperable Difficulties-That of Suffering the States to have officers according to the number of Troops furnished would prove injurious to officers of the Smaller States & Even if they were to Stand Intituled to promotions when they became the Senior officers In the Line of the Army. Their promotion would be uncertain as they would Constantly have to Combat with the Interest of States & the Caprice of Individuals to obtain it.  The Committee will Thank your Excellency for your Sentiments upon Every Paragraph of the Report (2) and beg you to give the Date of Colo Tilghman & Doctor McHenrys Entering the Service.(3)  In behalf of the Committee, I have the honor to be with the Most Lively Sentiments of affection and Esteem Dr Genl. your Excellencys most obedt Servant.

  Sir, Philadelphia March 9th 1781. I was honored with your Excellencys favor of the 2d Instant, covering an act of Congress of the 27th Ultimo, by which I am elected Secretary of the Marine.(1) Permit me, Sir, through you, to express my Gratitude to Congress, for this additional honor and mark of their Confidence. If any new incentive was necessary to bind me to America, or to increase my Zeal, for her Safety and Glory, this would be a powerful one. It is however a great Satisfaction to a Freeman; especially a Servant of a Republic; to have the approbation of its Representatives.  I am fully impressed with a due Sense of the importance of the Office. My Silence therefore till now, is owing to a mature Consideration of the duties of it, and my relation to the army, in the present State of our public Affairs, which I hope will plead my apology.  Upon full Reflection on the duties of the Secretary of the Marine, and the probable extent of them, during the War; I am persuaded, I can discharge them without interfering with my Command, in the field, in the active part of a Campaign. I cannot therefore in the  MARCH 9, 1781  present critical Condition of the United States in general, and that of the State of Newyork in particular; and, considering the early agency, I have had, in stimulating the opposition to the tyranny of Great Britain, think of retiring from the toils and perils of the field, intirely to an office secure from Danger. But if Congress think proper, to leave my Rank, Command, Pay and the future emoluments, Officers of my Rank are entituled to, for Military Services, as they now are, I will chearfully undertake it. And I shall rest with Congress; to determine on experience, what Salary, the discharge of that Office shall merit, as it is one of the first wishes of my heart to render America; every Service in my power.(2)  I wish to explain to Congress, the Subject of this Address more fully, than can be done in the Compass of a Letter.

9876,dg01746,1781,New York Delegates to George Clinton,"""New York Delegates to George Clinton
  Dear Sir, Philadelphia, March 11th, 1781 The representation which your Excellency transmitted to Congress on behalf of our State after a deliberate commitment and report has for several days engaged the attention of Congress;(1) the second proposition which you state for our relief (to wit) to issue the new bills in satisfaction of Commissary and Quarter Master's certificates was recommended by the Committee as the most eligible; but they did not propose it as a partial but a general indulgence extending to all the States.  On making an estimate of the probable amount of those certificates in the different States it was supposed that if they should be discharged on that principle, the Act of the 18th of March would be effectually frustrated. The Report was therefore almost unanimously rejected,(2) as a very capital dependance for carrying on the approaching campain is placed on the four tenths to arise to the public from the new emission.  The first proposition to advance money to our State in discharge of the Commissary and Quarter Master's certificates-however just and reasonable is put out of question, the exhausted State of our Finances rendering it totally impracticable.  The last expedient is attended with all the difficulties and inconveniences suggested by your Excellency, and cannot be embraced without operating greatly to the detriment of public credit and deeply injuring the new money. Other States, as North Carolina, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut were not restrained by the prohibition of Congress from adopting this project. It has given them temporary relief, and this seems to be all they consulted. For nothing is more certain than that if they issue only as much State  MARCH 11, 1781  money as they call in and cancel of the old Continental bills, the great object of the Act of the 18th of March, which was to diminish the quantity of money in circulation, and to substitute a real instead of a fluctuating and nominal medium of commerce, must be defeated, and our Finances continue as deranged as ever.  Congress however are fully convinced of the distresses and sufferings of the State of New York, as well as of their Spirited and expensive exertions in the common cause. And since they cannot afford us relief, they will not be displeased at any measures which the Legislature may think fit to adopt to extricate themselves from their present deplorable circumstances.  And if the emission of paper State money appears to the Legislature to be the only or best remedy for those pressing evils, it ought not to be rejected.  There can be no doubt but the requisitions made on our State must undergo a revision; Congress see the necessity of it. Indeed when the quotas were fixed, we apprized the Committee (of Estimates and Ways and Means) of our inability to contribute so largely under our present misfortunes. But finding it would lay a foundation for much altercation, as other States might claim a reduction of their quotas, it was thought most advisable to wait for the representation of the Legislature, as a ground for reasonable abatements. Nothing can now be exported from our State but what the Legislature shall judge compatible with their distresses: but care ought to be taken to point out what you cannot supply, that it may be required from the other States.  We ought not to omit mentioning that your Excellency's representation was communicated to the Assembly of Pennsylvania by the Committee to whom it was referred, with the approbation of Congress.(3) It was expected that this Assembly from motives of justice might have been prevailed on to advance money out of their Treasury to pay for flour which they and not we ought to have supplied. But it is reported to be out of their power, and a great waste of time is the only effect which has been produced.  A repeal of all Tender Laws is under consideration.4 The Quarter Master complains that they have effectually closed all the avenues to credit and confidence. The citizens will not part with their property while they are compellable to take paper in payment, which is not worth its nominal value.  It is probable that another measure will soon be adopted. A late law of Pennsylvania will not permit the old Continental money to be taken in, under Seventy five dollars of the old, for one of the new emission. The Act of New Jersey directs that the old money shall be paid in at its current value compared with specie.  An Act of Maryland in effect nullifies the bills of the old emission, after the period by which they ought to have been called in by taxes. These measures introduce such inequality and confusion, and open   a door to so much speculation and fraud, that it is in contemplation to call in the old emission after the time they ought to have been cancelled by taxes agreeably to the Act of the 18th March.  If our State should think proper to pass a law similar to that of Pennsylvania or New Jersey, and Congress should take decisive order to bring in the old emission, it may be taken for granted, that when Pennsylvania shall have issued their proportion of the new money, the people of that State will be glad to exchange at your Treasury, on the same terms as others had in their own, rather than suffer the old emission to sink in their hands. This event would furnish our State with the means of issuing the new bills under vast advantages, as 75 dollars of the old would enable us to put in circulation near four of the new, and the debt of 200,000,000 dollars would be cancelled almost insensibly.  We have executed the trust reposed in us by the Legislature respecting the Western Territory within our State.(5) From the manner in which this business was conducted it was left to us make the cession without a formal treaty with Congress. We therefore availed ourselves of the discretionary clause of our instructions, and have limited the State by a western boundary which, if there is any correctness in the maps must include the whole of Lake Ontario, and more considerably than twenty miles west of Niagara, and our Northern boundary we have limited by the forty fifth degree of N. Latitude. But lest it might possibly happen that this Western Boundary should fall short of the ultimatum assigned by the Legislature, we have made their ultimatum itself an alternative in that case in the words in which it is expressed in the instruction.  Virginia demanded in consideration of the cession she made, which consists of her claim to the Northwest of the Ohio, an explicit guarantee by the United States of her remaining jurisdiction. If we had in express terms made the same condition, it might have been liable to a construction that we were seeking a benefit, instead of conferring a favor; and yet it would have been imprudent to bind our State in a special guarantee of the jurisdiction of Virginia, when our own was not secured in the same manner. We therefore thought it necessary to connect our cession with an Act which subjects it to the ratification or disallowance of the Legislature, unless our State received the same guarantee from the confederated States as any other of its members which have or shall make cessions of territory for the common benefit.  We flatter ourselves that this precaution, though not directed by the Legislature, will meet with your Excellency's and their approbation. The authentic copies of the declaration and instrument of cession are herewith transmitted.  The government of New Hampshire has lately pressed Congress  in the most earnest terms to decide on the Vermont claims of independence, which has given that State a full Share of the fatal effects of this revolt. General Sullivan has accordingly moved Congress to come to a determination, and as he appears to be serious, it is probable that they will give the judgement which has been delayed but too long.(6) General McDougall has undertaken to detail this vexatious business; to his letter on this point we beg leave to refer.(7) Mr. Robert Morris is elected Superintendt. of the Finances, and Genl. McDougall Sec'ry of Marine, but neither have yet declared their acceptance. The late Board of War is continued in the administration of that department till the fall, it being conceived imprudent to hazard a change when the campaign is nearly opening. The Secretary of Foreign Affairs is not yet appointed.  Our Southern operations wear the most promising aspect. General Cornwallis is retreating, the country armed on all sides of him, and General Greene in pursuit; in several Skirmishes we have had the advantage. Arnold is not in a better Situation, as the Virginians, supported by Some Continental Troops will speedily be reinforced by the Marquis de la Fayette at the head of 1200 light infantry.  We hope soon to send you agreeable intelligence from those armies, which will have a decisive influence on our affairs. The collection of papers which are enclosed will communicate the particulars of our Southern operations and all the news.  We have omitted two important objects of your Excellency's representation, the defence of our frontiers, and a provision for the Oneidas. Your Excellency knows that the Commander in Chief has unlimited authority to direct the operations of the war, and to dispose of the troops at his pleasure.(8) And we are confident his sensibility and his particular regard for our State will induce him to take every measure for our protection which your Excellency may recommend as necessary. The Oneidas, we hope, are by this time in Some measure relieved, as the Commander in Chief acquaints the Board of War, that the clothing he had to spare would, he hoped, be sufficient for the present to make them comfortable.(9)  We are most unfortunate in the importation of our clothing: Colo. Lawrence and Colo. Palfry who are lately gone to France (10) on publick business have this necessary Article in Charge And we hope they will be able to send it forward. There is nothing gives Congress so much pain as the delays & too probably the sinister designs & frauds which have exposed our Army to nakedness & distress: At a time when a considerable Quantity of Clothing was actually purchased We can't entertain a doubt but if these Supplies arrive our Oneida freinds will have a Share. At present while it is impossible to Cover our own Army they cannot expect to be provided for as their sufferings & their merit require.  We have the Honour to be, with the utmost Regard & Respect, Sir, Your Excellency's most obedient & most humble Servants,  Jas. Duane Will. Floyd Alexander McDougall ""

  Dear Sir Phia 12th March 1781 I Intended to have written to you very fully by this Conveyance, but being indisposed for some days, I must defer it till another opportunity offers. I have not attended Congress since the first instant, when the Confederation was compleated.(1) Colonel Floyd from his Circumstances, will be obliged to leave this when the Roads are settled; and as the Confederation requires two Delegates at least to represent a State, ours will be unrepresented, unless some of the Delegates come on about that time.  The Question of the New Hampshire Grants will now soon be settled, as the State of that Name, urge its Delegate to press for a Decision, and there is great reason to expect it will be a just & Honorable one for our State.(2) The Session made by Virginia to the United States, has removed the Cause of opposition, which Maryland gave, to have our dispute setled; and the other small States not near us, will cease their opposition, as the Cause of it is removed. Pensylvania will urge a determination of their dispute with Connecticut, as soon as the business of their legislature is over. This I had from their President in a confidential conversation with him, on the Subject of the New England encroachments. The influence of the Officers of the New England Lines is considerable in their States, and the habits of thinking which they have acquired in the army are more conformable to the Genius of our Constitution than the Yeomanry of those States, who will unavoidably come into ours; and it is necessary the levelling principles of the Latter, should be tempered by those of the former.  It will be a good Stroke of Policy to grant those Gentlemen Land in our State, and it might be expedient to extend it to those of New Jersey; Vacant Lands in the grants might make a part of it. If this should be judged prudent, the Grant should extend to the Officers of those Lines who have resigned with good Reputations and to all the Soldiers who have served three years, and to all who shall serve during the war. Certain I am we shall derive great utility from such a measure, if it is soon done, and in my opinion no time is to be lost in doing it. I understand a Bill of this Nature was prepared in the  MARCH 13, 1781  fall of 1779 at Kingston, but was rejected from Considerations of narrow & nigarly Policy. If it had then been done, the influence of the Vermont Land Jobbers would ere this have been at an End, but it is better to do it now than not to do it at all. I could give you some conclusive intelligence on this Subject if time Permitted. Congress have elected me Secretary of the Marine; but I cannot think of quitting the field, in the active part of the Campaign, while so great a part of our State is in the hands of the enemy. I have therefore informed Congress of this as a Condition on which I will undertake the Charge of their Marine.(3)  The present State of it and their probable Funds will not take up the time of a qualified person in that Office, more than Six or eight Months of the Year, when the proper arrangements are made for its Government & future increase.

If Men of a different Character have by any Means been advancd to those hallowd Seats, who have even sollicitted publick Employment, to give a Scope to Views of Ambition & Avarice, Passions which have in all Ages been the Bane of human Society; or, to gratify the raging Thirst for popular Applause, a Disease with which little Minds are usally tormented, it is our Happiness that the Constitution requires annual Elections, & such Mistakes may be corrected at the next.  \""I was sorry to hear that the Number of Votes returnd the last time, did not amount to more than a Quarter of the Number of qualified Electors. The Choice of Legislators, Magistrates & Governors is surely a Business of the greatest Moment, & claims the Attention of every virtuous Citizen. The Framers of our happy Constitution while they gave due Attention to political, were not forgetful of Civil Liberty-that personal Freedom & those Rights of Property, which the meanest Citizen is intitled to, & the Security of which is the great End of political Society. It was not indeed their Province to make particular Laws for these Purposes. To do this, & to provide for the equal & impartial Execution of such Laws, agreable to the Constitution, is the Duty of the Legislature. Hence every Citizen will see, and I hope will be deeply impressd with a Sense of it, how exceedingly important it is to himself, & how intimately the Welfare of his Children is connected with it, that those who have a Share in making, as well as in judging & executing the Laws should be Men of singular Wisdom & Integrity. Such as are conscious that they are deficient in either of these Qualities, shoud even tremble at being named as Candidates! I hope the great Business of Elections will never be left by the Many to be done by the Few; for that few, before we are aware of it, may be the Engine of Corruption, the Tool of a Junto. Heaven forbid! that our Country  men should ever be biassed in their Choice by unreasonable Predilections for any Men, or that an Attachment to the Constituion should be lost \""in Devotion to Persons.\"" The Effect of this wd soon be to change the Love of Liberty into the Spirit of Faction. Let each Citizen remember, at the Moment he is offering his Vote, that he is not making a Present or a Compliment to please an Individual, or at least that he ought not so to do, but that he is executing one of the most solemn Trusts in human Society, for which he is accountable to God & his Country\""-\""When the great Body of the People are determind not to be imposd upon by a false Glare of Virtues held before their Eyes; but, making up their own Minds shall impartially give in their Suffrages, after their best Inquiry into the Characters of Candidates, for those whom they judge to be the fittest Persons, there will be no Danger that the generous Enthusiasm of Liberty so characteristick of the People of Massachusetts will ever sink into the Violence & Rage of Party, which has often provd fatal to free Republicks.

I have in a Letter forwarded yesterday, given Notice to the General Assembly, of my Wish to return home as early as may be and requested to be releivd by one of my Colleagues or otherwise as may be thought proper. I expect to have General Wards Servant to attend me on my Journey. He is afterwards to return here.  I am much concerned at the Dissention in the New South Society,(1) who have generally been remarkeable for Peace & Harmony. They should strive for a conciliatory Spirit as far as is consistent with good Conscience, condescend to each other in smaller Matters, and bear with each others Tempers.  I have not been unmindful of my Sons Situation, (2) as mentiond in his Letter to me some time ago. He will see by the Journals of Congress (Sept 30 1780) (3) that the officers in the Medical Department, are intitled annually to draw Cloathing from the Stores of the Cloathier General in the same Manner & under the same Regulations as are established for officers of the Line by a Resolution Novr 25. 1779-such Cloathing to be delivered by the Cloathier General MARCH 15, 1781  or any sub Cloathier in the State in which the officer to receive the Cloathing shall reside. I have sent the Journals of the Dates above mentioned, and wish Mr Davis or some other of my Friends would speak to Mr Ruggles, who I think is the Sub Cloathier in the State, in Behalf of my Son. I hope however that the Matter is already settled, & he gone to Newport. I am uneasy at his being absent from his Station any length of Time; for however necessary it may be, it may be turnd to the Disadvantage of his Character, which if I am not flatterd, he has hitherto kept unsullied. In this virtuous & important Struggle, he will remember that all of us must ruff it as well as we can. The medical Committee inform me that it is the Duty of the State Cloathier to furnish him without the Intervention of the Commander in Chief or Board of War.  Pray let Mrs Fogs know that Mr. Lovel & I have done all we could for the Relase of her Son who was made a Sea Prisoner & carried to New York. Our officers have some of them been sent to England, but not any of the Seamen, so that it is hoped he is still there. Many of them have died. They have lately been better treated than they were some time ago. The british Sea officers are retaind in close Confinement here till we hear what is to become of ours.

I mean to pay into your Hand for M-D's (1) use 140 Spanish milled Dollrs. or the equivalent and not merely 700 Livres Tournois. Take therefore from me whatever is the Exchange. My Friends pd. from 75 to 78, but perhaps it may have been raised a little by a Run of Paper from this Quarter or it may have fallen by \""The Arrival of a french Frigate at Boston with four Million Dollars.\"" (2) I would have you do full Justice to M-D and I know you will also act the friendly part to me. If Bills are there, as I hear they are, you make an advantageous Purchase of them to the amount of what you shall think proper to demand of me in Exch. of the 140 Ds. which I mean to pay. But, if you think it more essential to M.D.'s. Interests you may purchase the Coin, and remit it to buy a Bill here; where 4/6 Pensylvania will purchase 4/4 1/2 sterling. That is, provided the minister shd. continue drawing. M-D preferred having it done there, that the Proceeds might also remain under your Discretion. It was a Loss to me of 1300 Dollrs. that the 49 State were sent instead of 25 hard which they would have purchased. I am told also that I lose the Interest on every Sum recd. from the State. However, as I mentioned to you confidentially before, I am determined not to be the martyr of that and other such like Circumstances to which I have long been exposed.(3)  I send you now only 6360 Dollars, not knowing M D's Wishes till this Evening, and the Bearer being to set off in the Morning; and he being also in doubt whether he shall be able to take the Size of a Letter from me. But you must not omit to do the needful on that Score because I know of a good Opportunity to transmit you more in a few days that you can have occasion for; and the Surplus of MARCH 16, 1781  which you will deliver to my Wife or endeavor to turn into Chink for me as I shall point out. N.B. The quakerish Disaffected here in bargaining ask whether you intend Chink, or Limber-Chink meaning the new Continentl.  I wish I could give you better accounts from the southard than are circulating now. I must own I do not think Cornwallis is in any Danger of being ruined. He may be harrassed Somewhat. But he will reach a Port of Embarkation. I think this is much more than probable.  An Express came with two Duplicate Letters of Doctr. Franklin,(4) and many old Newspapers. It is the second Exertion of Zeal in that Way. The french Minister indeed had many Letters as well as Papers but the fr. Consul should have seen to the Portrage of them. The Expence, is great. The other Time alluded to, a Horse was lost in Hudson's River, whereby the Public were brought to extra Cost for their old News Papers sent from Boston to York Town.

Your Silk Stockgs. & Gloves are recovered so as scarcely to discover what they have been exposed to. The ribbed Hose are much spotted; perhaps are not rotted and may take Dye well.  We have decided today recommend all Tender Laws so far as they respect Ratio of Exchange. A large Tax is also recommended and the new Bills to be taken as Silver tho we promise to pay all Debts in Silver or real current Exchange so that if the People still chuse to do it they may go on biting their own Noses loading themselves with new Taxes to make good the Deficiencies which are caused by their specuting Principles & Practice.(5) I must quit I have hurt myself of late by Watchings.

Besides Congress have no resources for Supplies or funds on which to obtain a Credit, but from the States-and Can the States furnish us with either in So easy & equitable a way as by duties & Imposts-it would be easy to borrow money at home or abroad were we possessed of funds Commensurate to the loans or even to the Interest of the Sums we need-at present we are obliged to draw bills of Exchange on our Minister at the Court of France at a great risque & Sell them at a great loss.  Congress in a Committe of the whole have agreed to report that an Estimate of the Sums wanted for the Current year, beyond those all ready Called for, be transmitted to the States, & that they be Called upon for 6,000,000 of dollars to be paid in Specie or the new Continental bills in quarterly payments. I think that the old Continental bills Should be Called in or exchanged at their Current value & that the new bills Should Issue equal to Specie, in this Case neither the public or Individuals Can Suffer & there is nothing in the resolves of Congress that Contradict this, the Committee of the whole have likewise agreed to report to recommend to the States to Amend their laws making paper bills or tender other ways than ad valorem.(3) I inclose Some extracts from Govr Jeffersons letter (4) which Contains the Substance of the intelligence from the Southward.  I must leave Congress by the Middle of April. Genl Woolcot designs to leave it Sooner & Mr Huntington is determined to go home about the last of April.

  Dear Sir Philadelphia March 16th 1781 After considering the Subject you were pleased to mention To me this morning; with all the Coolness which a matter of such Importance requires; I am of opinion That Either Mr. Burk or myself must Stand in the Light of an aggressor by the Correspondence between us; without any relation to the Confidential State of Facts which I took the Liberty of Laying before you; and that this cannot alter the nature of the Dispute.(1) I am Therefore inclined to think, that there would be a manifest Impropriety in making it the Basis of a Decision; for though I am convinced of the Justice of the Relation; yet as it mentions two other Persons, either of whom I had much greater Reason to Suspect than Mr Burk, it will have an appearance of shifting a Supposed Charge from one to another to avoid Consequences; And as Mr Burk took up the Matter and applied it to himself without proper Evidence and made that the Foundation for a Letter so full of Asperity: I cannot Suppose that My Explanatory Letter (intended only to Satisfy you that I was not the aggressor) Should be Considered as having any weight in the Determination: for when Considered as Intended for your Information, it is proper and necessary. But if Considered as a Communication from me to Mr Burk through you; it will amount to an Explanation of my Letter to Congress which Mr Burk has already Demanded and I have refused; & which I think from the Correspondence Mr Burk is by no means Intitled to. I am far from wishing to Sport with my own Life,  MARCH 16, 1781  or to Deprive Society of so useful a member as I am Convinced Mr Burk is. Yet Disagreable & Hazardous as the Task may be; the Justice I owe to myself will not Suffer me to Avoid this Event at the Expence of my own reputation. These are my Sentiments upon the Subject; and if yours Correspond with them; (and no other mode for Compromizing the Dispute, can be adopted) I shall however reluctant Submit to a Decision by Arms & Leave the Event to Fortune.(2) But should you be of Different Sentiments as I have called upon you to Act as Guardian to my Honor I shall acquiesce in your opinion.  I have the Honor to be very respectfully Dear Sir your most obedt Servt, Jno Sullivan  P.S. If Mr Burk had in his first Letter requested an Explanation of That part of mine to Congress which he Erroneously Supposed was intended for him (personally) & had Informed me of the part he had taken in Congress & had Even in Decent Terms hinted his opinion respecting my Conduct & Capacity as an officer I Should have given him the Explanation Contained in my Confidential Letter to you & Endeavored to remove his ill grounded prejudice against me. But when he undertook by Letter to Inform against himself & in Justification to accuse me of the want of Every Talent requisite for an officer & this without the proper Evidence, & I am Sure I need not tell You That the whole Army from the Commander in Chief to the Lowest Soldier (with only one or two Exceptions) would Join in refuting the assertions: I say to a Letter of this Complextion for me to have given him the Explanation he Demanded would have Argued a want of Spirit and Even a meaness which in any Event Mr. Burk shall find me Incapable of, & I must Submit to Your Judgment whether Admitting my Confidential Letter to Serve as a Basis for reconciliation will not be Tantamount to what he has heretofore very improperly Demanded & I have peremptorily refused.

Greene expected a Body of six or Eight hundred mounted Riflemen under Colo. Wm. Campbell soon to join him from over the Mountains, when he hoped to harrass the Enemies Rear. He was but illy assisted by the Militia and remained the Inferior Army. The People were much disaffected, having many of them joined Cornwallis. Our Genl. had been successful at all Times in the Pettit Guerre. In one Instance the Enemy having killed & hung in Quarters a Trumpeter of Lt. Col. Lee's Corps, our Cavalry made an immediate Charge, and sacrificed sixteen of the Enemy's Troopers. In a late Attempt to surprize Tarlton, Genl. Marian of the Militia, and Lt. Colo. Lee, came across upwards of Hamilton's Corp's and N. Carolina Tories, most of whom were cut up, on the Spot; This occasioned Tarlton's Escape, who was alarmed by some of the Militia's firing. The Enemy have ordered two Regiments of Negroes to be embodied in So. Carolina and are drafting many of the effective Whites to serve during the \""Rebellion.\"" Indeed Sir, we must reduce New York, or put on foot a very expensive Campaign, against the Enemy in the Southern States; Otherwise their Numbers there will encrease in a Geometrical Proportion.

I hope they will soon be transmitted.(2) A Plan is also maturing for the States to enable Congress to oblige the Delinquent States to do their Duty; This, as it will be additional to the Articles, must be first proposed to the States for their Ratification. It is finished in a Committee; and I hope will be approved by Congress.

But I have heard since I wrote, that you will find more Difficulty in the first than the 2d. I wish I had been 3 weeks sooner. Upon the whole I confide altogether in yr.

I hope we shall have great occasion to rejoice also. Much may be done by the Allied Force in Cheseapeak and I hope the Dutch will instantly combine with France & Spain.

  Sr. Philadelphia March 20th 1781 Since our last nothing new has happend except the Sailing of the French fleet Consisting of (as near as we can obtain intelligence) the Ships and Guns as per list inclosed (1) together with about twelve Hundred of their Chosen troops which we f[l]atter our selves are by this time actively and Successfully employd in our Bay; And the  MARCH 20, 1781  departure of the M de la Fayette with about the Same Number of men (and a fine train of Artillery) who we hope is by this time acting in Conjunction with them, against Arnold. We must add to the above intelligence that a report is Current here and generally believed that the British have taken St. Eustatia and Curassau, with all the Dutch and American Vessels in their Harbors, together with a Dutch Line of Battle Ship.

  Dear Sir Philad. 22d March 1781. Your favour to me which was accompanied by a Memorial to Congress I had the pleasure to receive. The Memorial was immediately referred to the board of War and I have informed them that it's your wish that no Report shoud be made till you have had an opportunity of stating your Claims in person.(1) I have no doubt but so reasonable a Request will be complied with. To this day we have no news from the Southward but what you may find in the prints: our Expectations are high, and our Anxiety great in proportion. Much depends on the Maneuvres of the French fleet & probably on the issue of a naval Engagement. Arnold unless reliev'd by Sea must in all human probability fall with all his detachment into our Hands. Our prospects with respect to General Green's Success continue favorable. I need not tell you the great Effects which are to be expected from a Successful Issue. The Dutch with all their deliberation are hurried into a War, and considerably injured in the unlookd for Seizure of St. Eustatia, Curacoa and 160 of their Ships in the Texel. If they have any national Honor or Pride left they will rouse to Vigorous Exertions. They are poor in Revenue: but as a People the richest perhaps in Europe; and they want nothing but Virtue-and that may be supplied by Resentment-to throw a decisive Weight into the scale of the Allies.

  Dear Sir, Philada. 22 March 1781 The Subject of the Dutch War engrosses the Conversation here. The Capture of St. Eustatius has interfered very deeply with the Property of several Merchants in the City, and some of the best Ships belonging to the Port have been lost in the Fracas. I cannot think, either from the whole Circumstances of the Case, or from the Tenour of the Manifesto, that Great-Britain is persuaded The United Provinces will engage in a War, but rather that it is expected they will descend, as, I am sorry to say, they have sometimes MARCH 22, 1781  formerly done, to unworthy Compliances and patch up the matter under Conditions of ample Indemnification in Point of Property, which no Doubt Great-Britain will offer. My Hope is greater than my Confidence that the Dutch will not depart from the Principles which have raised them to a Nation, and given them Rank among the Powers of Europe; and knowing that Your Excellency has a Correspondence there, and a Reputation probably still more extensive than your Correspondence, I take the Liberty to suggest and observe, what, in all Likelihood, has already occurred, that Letters dispatched forthwith to that Country, either directly, or by such circuitous Conveyance as Opportunity may present, will be of essential Service. To this may be added, with good Effect, candid Strictures on the Manifesto, which lies very open to Remark and Refutation. These may be published immediately here; they will soon find their way to Europe; and a Request may be sent to publish them there as American Sentiments. These Things I beg Leave to submit to your Excellency's Attention.  At writing we have no authentick Intelligence from the Cheeseapeak, but expect it hourly.

  Sir Philadelpa. 24t March 1781 I have been honoured with your Excellencys Letter of the 7th instant, with the Constitution or Articles of Government of Connecticut in 1636. The renewed Charter of Charles the 2d has also been recd. Before these came to Hand it became Necessary to print the Constitution of our State according to the Act of Congress. As I had a general Knowledge that the Charter of Charles the 2d was no more than a Confirmation of the Government established by our Ancestors with Some Additions and Improvments-And that the original Form of Government would not exhibit a full Idea of our present Constitution-And the Charter of Charles the 2d would be improper to be published-And that the Principles of our Government were in a great Measure founded upon certain fundamental Laws. I had no apprehension that the real Constitution of the State could be otherwise given to the Publick, than by an Account of the leading and main Princeples upon which the Goverment Operated, And having found an Account of the Constitution of our State printed in 1779 with tolerable Judgment and Accuracy, I have upon the Advice of the President of Congress, agreed to publish this Account with some Alterations (1)-which I think will give a good general Veiw of the Princeples of our Goverment as now existing, without entering into a Detail of it's Origin or Derivation which would be rather perhaps a Matter of Amusement than useful Information or productive of real Benefit. I shall be happy if what I have done Shall Meet with the Approbation of your Excellency and the State.  Your Excellency will recive from the President a Recommendation of Congress to the State to revise and amend their late Law  MARCH 24, 1781  Vesting the United States with Power to Collect certain Dutys, (2) so as that it Shall comport with the former Recommendation of Congress on that Head. The Reasons for this Recommendation are clearly Stated in the Act of Congress. The Non Complyance of the State in the Manner recommended gave some Surprize, as Congress had been full in the Opinion Not only with Regard to the Necessity but the Justice and Utility of the Measure, but supposed that our State would have a clear Interest in supporting it, or their Consumption of Foraign Articles much exceeded their Imports-And that the Dutys if they were not collected for a general Benefit, would (or they had in this State began to be) levied for a local advantage, which would operate most unjustly, or the Consumers must pay the Tax, and consequently if they lived in a different State would be charged with Taxes, for local, and partial Purposes for which they would not derive the least Benifit, and would not withstanding the Payment of those Taxes be charged with their full Quota of Debt to the united States. That this was a Circumstance which when well Understood by the States would produce severe altercations if not timely prevented. It is true the Act of Congress does not propose that the States Should have the exclusive Right to regulate this Affair which perhaps it might have been well if it had provided for. But probably no State will Enhance that Duty for themselves. It was Observed likewise that The Convention who Met at Hartford had recommended the Measure. And that Connecticut had Commissioners in that Convention. And that the State had not Signified their Desapprobation of what had been done by them. The Assembly of this State are not sitting, it is said that they will Adopt the Measure- which so farr as I have heard is well approved of in this Place.  Your Excellency will likewise receive a Recommendation, that the States collect in Quaterly Payments Six Millions of Dollars in Specie or the New Emission beginning the first of June. I shall make no other observation upon this Measure than that it will be obvious that the Portion Assigned to Connecticut is too high compared with Massachusetts and some other States. In this Congress have governed themselves by former Precedents, except by lessening the Quotas of N York and N Carolina and placing the Deficiency proportionably on the other States. In this Place I will Observe to your Excellency that We have but the least Reason to expect Money from Abroad. This has been So clearly communicated that We must depend upon it.  The Commissary Genl. of Purchases Complains that by Reason of the Scanty Supplys of fresh Provisions the Army are fed with that which is Salted, in great Measure. This Circumstance will be severely felt the next Summer unless rectified as We are officially Acquainted that a Cooperation against The Enemy is designed. The Commissary also says that there is a most unreasonable Deficiency between the  Beeff charged the Publick and what is delivered to the Army. This Accusation is general.  The Rate of Exchange here is 130 Dollars old Money for one in specie. This Occasions Vast Quantitys to be sent on to the Eastward. And indeed the People from thence are here buying the old Money, as the Exchange is So much lower there than here. I mention this Circumstance as I suppose that a Depretiation at the Eastward may be expected soon to take Place. This old Money is continually undulating from one Part of the Continent to the Other, And productive of all the Mischief which can Attend a fluctuating Medium, But I will make no Observations but State Facts, upon which your Excellency is the best Able to judge with Regard to what Measures May be the most proper to be adopted.  We have no News from N Carolina but what your Excellency will See in the Papers. There is an Acco. which is probably true that the Two Fleets from the Eastward had an Ingagment On the 16t off the Capes of Virginia. The Capt of the Brig who brings this Intelligence left the Fleets in the Action-he says that the French were at the Windward, that but one of the English Ships supposed to be the Admirals had engaged, that as he was Attacked by three or four French Ships She was drove out of the Line. We must Wait to hear the Result of this affair.  I Wrote to Mr Ellsworth some time ago that it was Necessary for me to Return home early in April.(3) He has given me no Reason to believe that either he or Mr Law would be here by that Time. I hope that the Assembly have Appointed New Members in the Room of the late Mr. Hosmore and Col Adams resigned. Mr Huntington and Mr Root I suppose will tarry here till the latter End of next month Altho Mr Root talks as if he Should Return a little earlier yet I think he will tarry till that Time.  I am with the highest Esteem and Regard, your Excellency's Most Obedient Servant, Oliver Wolcott  ""

  [March 27? 1781](1) Before this can reach you, our Countrymen will have finishd the important Business of electing their Legislators, Magistrates and Governor. I hope they have made a wise Choice.(2) At least, from the Opinion I entertain of their Virtue; I am purswaded they have acted with all that Deliberation & Caution which the Solemnity of the Transaction required. They may then reflect, each one on his own Conduct, and appeal to the Monitor in his Breast, that he has not trifled with the sacred Trust reposed in him by GOD & his Country-that he has not prostituted his Honor and Conscience to  MARCH 27, 1781  please a Friend or a Patron-that he has not been influenced with the View of private Emolument to himself or his Family, but has faithfully given his Vote for the Candidate whom he thought most worthy the Choice of free & virtuous Citizens. I congratulate that Legislator, Magistrate & Governor, who knows that neither Smiles, Intreaties, Gifts, Dissimulation, Intrigue nor any base & dishonorable Practices, have procured him his exalted Station. His Fellow Citizens, unsollicited by him, have called him into their Service, from the opinion they have formd of his Integrity & adequate Abilities. He feels himself happy in their good Opinion of him. Happy is he indeed, if he is conscious he deserves it.  But our Countrymen will not imagine, that having filled the several Departments of Government, they have no further Concern about it. Their Duty and Interest, I humbly conceive, should lead them to attend to the Manner in which it is administerd, by those whom they have entrusted. How often has the finishing Stroke been given to publick Liberty, by those who have possessd or seemd to possess many amiable Virtues! Gustavus Vasa was viewed by the Swedes as the Deliverer of their Country from the Danish yoke.(3) The most implicit Obedience, says the Historian, was considered by them as a Debt of Gratitude and a Virtue. He had many excellent Qualities. His Manners were conciliating-his Courage & Abilities, great. The People by an entire Confidence in him, sufferd him to lay a Foundation for an absolute Monarchy. They were charmd with his Moderation and Wisdom, Qualities which he really possessd; but they did not consider his Ambition nor had they a Thought of his Views. They found Peace restord, Order establishd, Justice administerd, Commerce protected & the Arts and Sciences encouragd, & they looked no further. They did not imagine that he who had been instrumental in recovering the Independence of their Country, was the very Man who was to effect the Ruin of their Liberties. By the Constitution of Sweden their Kings were elective, & the Powers of their Sovereign were exceedingly limitted. The unsuspecting People even voluntarily gave up their Right of Election, & sufferd Gustavus to increase the Powers of the Crown & entail it in his own Family! This is the Account which the History of Sweden gives us; and it affords an Instance among a thousand others, of the Folly & Danger of trusting even good Men with Power, without regarding the Use they make of it. Power is in its Nature incroaching; and such is the human Make, that Men who are vested with a Share of it, are generally inclind to take more than it was intended they shoud have. The Love of Power, like the Love of Money, increases with the Possession of it; and we know, in what Ruin these Baneful Passions have involvd human Societies, in all Ages, when they have been let loose, & sufferd to rage uncontrould. There is no Restraint like the pervading Eye of the virtuous Citizens. I hope therefore, our Country  men will constantly exercise that Right which the meanest Citizen is intitled to, & which is particularly secured to them by our happy Constitution, of inquiring freely but decently into the Conduct of the publick Servants. The very Being of the Common wealth may depend upon it. I will venture to appeal to the Experience of ancient Republicks to evince the Necessity of it; and it is never more necessary than in the Infancy of a Common wealth, & when the People have chosen honest Men to conduct their Affairs. For, Whatever is done at a Time nearly cotemporary with the Constitution, will be construed as the best Exposition of it, and a mistaken Principle of a virtuous Ruler, whose publick Conduct is generally good and always supposd to be honestly intended, carries with it an Authority scarcely to be resisted, and Precedents are thus formed, which may be dangerous-perhaps fatal.

  Dear Sir, Philada. 27th March 1781 It is a long time since I have been favourd with a Line from you. It is more than probable that our Communications on both sides miscarry, Indeed I have had so little, which coud afford pleasure, to transmit, and I think it the worst of All Employments to vex my Friends who are happy enough to retire from this anxious Theatre with Incidents which may depress their Spirits without being of publick Advantage. All our Evills may be resolved into the Want of money which seems to pervade every State, at least none of them have made Exertions to remove the Complaint. To keep the general Treasury exhausted while the Country abounds with plenty and there is a high market for every sort of produce, and many of the States enjoy uninterrupted Tranquillity: cannot be accounted for on any principle which does Honour to our Patriotism or publick Spirit. Where this backwardness is avoidable it ought to be reprobated; for there seems no doubt but with a very moderate Share of Vigour the Enemies of this Country will be expelled in a single Campaign.  Every thing practicable here has been done for maintaining the Southern States in a spirited opposition against Cornwallis & Arnold. I am convinced that if the Pensylvania Line instead of revolting for want a little money had marched to Join Greene the British Powers in the Carolinas & Georgia must have been totally  MARCH 27, 1781  broken. You will not doubt this when you learn that only the Remnant of the Maryland Line with some Virginia Levies and militia in the whole 4000, engaged Cornwallis at the Head of 2500 chosen british Veterans for an hour and an half; and then after great Slaughter on both sides retired a mile & an half in good order and Spirits; and were only prevented by the rain from renewing the Attack in the morning. It is clear that Cornwallis was much crippled or he woud have pursued a retiring Foe. Indeed his loss is said to be 700 our's 300. We shall be reinforced; his Army must waste; And our prospect is as fair as ever to ruin him effectually.  Arnold has a Reprieve. The French and british fleets have met near the Capes of Virginia and a Hardy Engagement ensued. Night separated them. De Estouches expected and prepared to renew the Combat next morning; Arburthnot was contented with his Share of the battle, and in the night time steered his Course for Portsmouth leaving his Antagonist master of the Sea. Can a british Admiral Justify thus retiring from an inferior Squadron of the French who they pretend[....]He will plume himself on relieving Arnold; But it coud not have hurt his Reputation to beat the French in the bargain. To hide from them seems inglorious.  I have now passed nearly another year in Congress, and am sufficiently tired & homesick. You will I presume be requested to take my place. Your Services will be exceedingly necessary. I set out as soon as the Roads admit. Col. Floyd has heard disagreeable Accounts of his Ladys health which hurries him away this day.(1) You will have the pleasure of seeing your new Sister soon, as the Col. thinks of setting out to morrow.

  Dear Madam. Philadelphia 27th March 1781. I have been honored with your very agreable Letter of ; but have it not about me. Should you pursue your Intention of going to the Southward, I shall be peculiarly happy in seeing you on the Way. We have not Accounts of late from General Greene, but a Letter received Yesterday from Governor Jefferson of Virginia, gives us the following Intelligence.(1) \""That on the fifteenth of this Month a General Action was fought between the two Armies, wch. continued incessant for an hour and a Quarter; That General Greene then retired in good Order, unpursued, one Mile and an half, with the Loss of four Pieces of Canon and between two & three hundred killed and wounded. The Enemies Loss between five and six hundred: That General Greene intended a second Attack the day following, but was prevented by Rain; That every Circumstance indicated a new Engagement.\"" This Acct. the Governor received from a Capt. of Artillery who was in Action. I now know what the Sensations of your Breast will be upon reading so far; But lest your Cheeks should become too crimson, I shall not mention them; For you are sensible I can never command my own Countenance When that of a Lady is agitated. However, This, to me, & most People who think cooly, is very good Intelligence. For Considering the small Number of our Continental Troops, and the irregular Nature of the Southern Militia, we might have expected a total Defeat, instead of a Conflict so equally maintained. To convince the Militia that they can fight is half making them Veterans; And We may safely pronounce General Greene's Strength after the Battle, a Quarter greater than before. So true it is that all the Benefits of a long Experience may be gained in an Hour. I have not felt so firm a Persuasion of Success from the Beginning as at present. Perhaps you may think me too anxious on the Side of Friendship, and too much interested in your Felicity to indulge different Reflections; But I give you the Account exactly as we have received it; & shall repeat my Information as soon as more authentic Intelligence shall be obtained. I love Sincerity for its own sake as well as for the Relation it bears to social Connection, And I declare upon my Honor, America ought, and doubtless will  MARCH 27, 1781  record this Event as much in her Favor. It would perhaps be indelicate to suggest in this Way, my own, or the Opinion of others upon the military Conduct of General Greene, during this most critical, distressing and important Command in the Southern Department. Human Tenderness however demands one Tribute; His military Character is universally admired. Be pleased to make my best Respects to our good Friends, and accept the best Wishes of your very obedient & most humble Servt. J.M. Varnum  ""

Green & Lord Cornwallis on the 15th Instant, but as yet we have no particulars except that it was expected the Attack would be renewed in a day or two, we are anxious to hear the Event. Sumpter, Marian, & Pickens had a considerable Body of Militia in Motion between Camden & the Enemy, & about 1000 North Carolina Militia were in the neighbourhood of Wilmington, where the British had not more than 300 Men intrenching themselves by Accounts from So. Carolina dated last Month, we find our Friends at St. Augustine were in good Spirits & determined to hold out to the last, but many of those left behind had been reduced to the necessity of making a temporary submission rather than see their families starve, which they must otherwise have done. Capt. Vanderhorst who had been in a Flagg to fetch away his Family was arrived at Newburn, & writes me, that he could give me interesting Accounts of our Friends in that quarter, but he did not venture to commit it to paper, if we can give them any Effectual Aid, many of them will be ready to cooperate with us, but others have lost themselves for ever-for instance, Old Colo. Pinckney has accepted the office of Superindant of the Police in the room of Jas. Simpson who has gone to New York, but our Ladies to their eternal Honour have uniformly supported their Characters of staunch Whiggs-they steadily refuse any Association with the British Officers, will go to none of their Public Amusements, & it may be depended on as a Fact, that many who were reduced to the necessity of selling their Buckles now wear Black & White Roses in their Shoes in Honour of the alliance, which is now a distinguishing MARCH 28, 1781  Badge between Rebel & Royalist as they are termed.

  Dear Sir Philada. 28 March 1781 This Morning I had the Honour of your Excellency's Letter dated the 24 inst. I should have written you by Post Yesterday, but knowing of a Conveyance today or tomorrow Morning, I postpond it hoping to possess myself more fully of the News from the French Fleet as well as from General Greene.  The Substance of both you have probably heard; I will set down as shortly and correctly as I can the Details I have collected.  On the 15 inst the Engagement between General Greene and Lord Cornwallis was fought. The Intelligence of it comes verbally to Richmond in Virginia by a Captain Singleton of the Artillery who left General Greene's Head-quarters next Day. Governour Jefferson writes it from thence to Congress. It is said both Armies were prepared and desirous of Action; that the Contest was pretty general and severe, and lasted near two Hours; that it happened about a mile and a Half from Guilford Court-house in North Carolina; that Lord Cornwallis was about 2500 strong and General Greene near 4000, mostly Militia, but this according to General Greene's Letter to Congress dated a few Days before the Action, must be a Mistake, as he could not from Probabilities have more in the whole than about 26 or 2700; that the Militia and Regulars of our Army suffered nearly equal Numbers; that General Greene retreated about a Mile and a Half from the Ground leaving it to the Enemy, who did not think fit to pursue; that our Loss was about 300 killed, wounded and Prisoners and 4 Pieces of Artillery; among the killed Major Anderson of the Maryland Regulars and Capt Barret of Washington's Cavalry; among the wounded General Stevens of the Virginia Militia and Capt Fontleroy of the above mentioned Cavalry, the latter left on the Field; the Informant says that from what he saw he was of Opinion General Greene meant to renew the Action next Morning but was prevented by a heavy Rain; that there appeared no Want of Spirits in his Army, but being mostly Militia or raw Recruits they fought at great Disadvantage against Cornwallis' Veterans; that when he left General Greene it seemed to be his Intention to fight the Enemy again as soon as the Weather permitted. I cannot MARCH 28, 1781  however be of Opinion with this Officer but think that the Enemy will either push our Army back, or that General Greene will retreat to a greater Distance to restore his Army to a Condition for another Action. Cornwallis is still near 200 Miles from any Part of the Seaboard, and if General Greene can keep a near Countenance upon him he may still be hurt considerably, and pared away before he gets off, if indeed he shall chuse to retire farther.  The Action between the Fleets is important only in its Consequences, our Disappointment and the British Fleet getting into Hampton-road. Both Fleets arrived off the Capes of Virginia nearly at the same Time, the French rather before, but not long enough to get fairly into the Bay and prepare for debarking the Men. They were under the Necessity of fighting, though neither Side appears to have been very desirous of beginning or earnest in continuing the Action. Nothing decisive has taken Place on either Side; both had some Ships a little disabled. In the French Fleet the Conquerant was shot in the Rudder and the Ardent in her Masts and Yards so far to be in an unfavourable Situation for fighting. Some other Ships suffered a little in their Rigging. The French have returned to Rhode-Island to refit. One of their Frigates is unfortunately left in Cheeseapeak; the Hermion, Capt de la Touche, is arrived at Chester with Dispatches for the Minister. This sadly deranges our Plans, but however we will hope for our Day.  No late News from Europe. As I expect to be at Trenton in a Day or two, shall beg your further attention to what I mentioned respecting the Dutch. Your Ideas are certainly right.  I have the Honour to be, Your Excellency's obedt Servant. W C Houston  ""

  Dr. Sir, 29 Mar 1781 I presume in this you have received the Paper Intelligence; but as that is not authentic nor so particular as the Account from the Southard by Governor Jefferson's Letter to Congress Received on Wednesday last, I do my self the Honor to favor you therewith.(1)  The Governor Writes that on the 15th Inst. about a Mile and a Half from Guilford Court House Green & Cornwallis had a Battle, which lasted one Hour & a Quarter, that Green retreated a Mile & a Half in good Order, having lost two Peices of Cannon and about 300 killed and wounded, Cornwallis lost between 500 & 700 killed and wounded, that General Green determined to renew the Attaque the Next Morning, but the Weather prevented. The Enemy were 2500, & our Troops including Militia or Mostly so 4000, our Men &c behaved well, were in high Spirits & anxious for another Engagement, this Account the Governor had from an Officer who was in the Action.  This I call a very good Account, for if Green is so strong as to Attac the Enemy, he only has to keep up the Ball awhile and he must MARCH 29, 1781  effectually Ruin his Lordship, two more such Victories would probably Burgoine him & his Veterans  All the Accounts we have of an Action between the Fleets have been published which I dare say you have seen, and I think it may be said, (all things Considered) that the French Arms have gained Reputation.  I would just Mention to you that Monday come a Week Mr. McKean has to attend a Court in this City and Tuesday Week our Supreme Court begins, so that Delaware will be unrepresented in Congress. Newhampshire, Newyork & Rhode Island are now in the same situation. I shall be detained about 10 Days and I wish you if possible to order Matters so as to be here on Sunday come a Week, for you know that your Attendance (although you alone cannot give the Vote of the State) is Necessary & may be very useful.

  Dear Sir Trenton 31 March 1781. I left a Line for you at my Lodgings before I came out of Town,(1) to which I make no Doubt you will give Attention, as the Subject of it is so nearly connected with the Justice and Honour of Congress.  I will frankly confess to you that my Mind labours under a Load of Anxiety respecting the Settlement of the Powers of the Superintendent of Finance,(2) and indeed the whole Business of that Department. It appears to me that there is no Alternative. Those Powers, or similar ones, must be vested in some one Person, in Order to extricate our Affairs from the Confusion in which they are at present involved. The Board of Treasury only make bad, worse. To go on in the present Train is absolutely impossible. A total Stagnation must soon take Place, and Ruin cannot be far off. Were our Affairs in a State of Beginning, Powers so extensive would not be necessary; but per- MARCH 31, 1781  plexed, deranged and clogged with Abuses and Mismanagements as they are at present, it really appears to me that less Powers would be altogether unavailing. Economy is now our only Resort, our other Resources, you know, are reduced to a very narrow Compass. This Economy never will, indeed never can be introduced by a Body constituted as Congress is; I venture to say it never will be practised by their Boards, as they now are. They seem to know Nothing about either getting Money or saving it. These things must, if they are ever well done, be the work of one Mind. I am clearly convinced that our Affairs cannot be otherwise retrieved from their present disperate disjointed State with respect to Money-matters.  I was in Congress but a very few Days, but during those few Days near 100,000 Dollars were voted to a Member or two of Congress, the Deputy Secretary and a Clerk in the Treasury.(3) Would not this have relieved many poor People who are almost starving for their Interest of Money in the Funds, or almost ruined through the Failure, on our Part, of fulfilling Contracts? Who can justify these Things? and can Congress suppose they will be borne with? And yet this will ever be the Case while the Expenditure of the publick Money is managed as at present.  As to the Gentleman who is elected Superintendent of Finance, I have no great Acquaintance with him, nor more Predilection for him than any other capable and upright Man. He is acknowledged a Man of Abilities and Character, and I believe if he has Time given him will yet retrieve our Affairs, Almost hopeless as they are in that Line. But it is the Trust I speak of and not Men. What he has to do cannot be done without efficient Powers, and Congress may at length see the Necessity of giving those Powers, when a less capable Man must have them.  I foresee Clamours, Memorials and Resignations, but if Congress refuse a Measure on that Account, no Reformation will ever take Place. However Diana of the Ephesians (4) is not so great as she was in the Year 1778 and 9 when Men were paid a large percentage for contriving the Means of Squandering the publick Money. See what a Man says of Congress in the Papers because he was disappointed of an Office.  If however cannot think of conferring the Powers without Limitation, restrict them to the Duration of the present War, or to a Year, or so many Years for Experiment. Desperate Diseases require peculiar remedies. The Power of Suspension you are convinced will not do. Trusting much to your Friendship and great good Sense I have written freely, but I hope not impertinently. I am sincerely yours, W C. Houston  ""

The Enemy will give you one of the most candid accounts of the naval Engagement on the 16th (1) that I have at any time seen in Rivington's royal Gazette. Our Allies have conducted most gallantly: a Fog which seperated their Ships a few days before the Engagement deprived them of the Opportunity of giving an immense Turn to our southern affairs. However, their proved Zeal & Activity have so impressed the Enemy that the british Fleet has not ventured to remain in Chesapeak to push the Advantages which had fallen to them by the Chance of War. We have some pretty possitive Information of a severe Cannonade of three hours at Sea on the morning of the 24th after the british had gone down the Bay of Cheseapeak at present I suspect that both the Severity & Continuance are heightned by Imagination from some single Engagement between two Frigates.

  Dear Sir, Philada. April 1st. 1781. I yesterday was favoured with your Letter but know not when or from whence wrote as it was without date.  The Night before last we recd an Official Acct. of Genl Greens engagement with Cornwallis on the 15th March; it differs but little from the Accts before recd. The Victory was on the Side of Cornwallis as Genl. Green retired from the field with near 300 killed & wounded, & 4 field pieces lost, and near 900 Militia & some Continentals mising who mostly run away in the beginning of the Action-his order of battle was three lines-the North Carolina Militia composed the first in front with the field pieces, most of those run away without firing a gun throwing away their Arms, some few of them fired once some twice but none more; of those about 550 are missing. The Virginia Militia principally composed the Second line, they made some short stand, of these about 260 are missing but not Supposed to be taken. The third line was Continentals, the engagement was very severe and Obstinate and the Victory dearly purchased owing wholly to Superiour Dicipline. One or two more such Victories would ruin his Lordship as he must be greatly encumbered with his wounded, ours were brought of. Cornwallis was 160 Miles from Cambden & near that distance from Wilmington the nearer Seaport-my greatest fears are that the detachments from New York are gone to his relief, and may join him before Genl. Green may be in Condition to renew the fight, tho' in Case Cornwallis attempts to move he will meet probably with a constant Anoyance from our Troops, who, it is said are in high Spirits and wish for another engagemt. APRIL 1, 1781  You must have heard before this a full Acct. of the Naval engagemt. on the 16th between the French & British fleets, of the formers bending their Course for Rhode Island, and the latters going into the Chesapeeke and which by a Letter from the Marquis had put to sea again on the 24th.(1) One part of the Marquis's Letter Occasions various Conjectures he informs that soon after the British fleet had got out of the bay he heard a very severe Canonade for three hours without interruption as he had not heard of the french fleets returning for Rhode Island he makes no doubt that the engagemt. was between them & the British and appear extreemly Anxious to hear how it issued. It is Certain the french fleet was on their way to Rhode Island on the l9th when the Hermoine left them & came into this river, with whom then this engagemt. could be is only Conjecture; if any such really happened it must be, either the fleet bound to Rhode Island meeting with one or more french ships had returned; or the second division bound to Rhode Island from France, which is the most general opinion but how that fleet should happen to be [at] the mouth of the Chesapeeke is a question not easily answered, & besides it seems rather too early in the year for their Arrival. I think it might be our frigates the Confederacy & Saratoga bound here from the Cape at whom they might fire three hours on a Chase at long shot, this however is my fear but I am alone m it.  As to Politicks, I never mention any in a Letter unless I am Certain of a safe Conveyance.

  Dear Sir. Philadelphia, April 2nd, 1781. I have just had the pleasure of receiving your letters of the 11th and 17th, and one from Mr. Smith, and another from my brother. I wrote to them both last week.(1) You will, before this reaches you, have received an account of the action between the two fleets off the Capes of Virginia. I have seen the New York account, which is rather more in favor of the French than their own. Upon the whole the French gained more honor than profit in that conflict, as they miscarried in their principal object, that of destroying the party at Portsmouth, who have since been reinforced, and I fear will be very troublesome. We have reason to expect essential reinforcement from our ally; I am not at liberty to be more particular.(2) There are many things I would wish to say as well regarding the public as my private affairs, but the fear of my letters miscarrying withholds me. I therefore submit every thing to your discretion. We have very speedy intelligence here of every interesting motion of the armies to the westward. I. Buchanan sent me the New York papers as late as the 29th ult.; they contain nothing interesting, nor have we any late advices from Europe. My brother writes me of his indisposition, which gives me very great concern. I hope to be in as good health as ever in a few weeks of warm weather.

  Sir, Philadelphia 2d, April 1781 It is a long Time since I have been honored with any Commands from your Excellency, which makes me impatient to know the Result of my last Application. Inclosed is an official Account of a late Action between General Greene and Lord Cornwallis. Had the North Carolina Militia behaved well, General Greene's Success must have been brilliant. We lost four Pieces of Artillery, the whole that were in the Field. The British Fleet, on the Twenty sixth of March past, were in the Chesepeak, having been joined with a Number of Transports, supposed from New York, as General Phillip's Command, consisting of about two Thousand, had, some Time since, em[b]arked. Every Circumstance indicates a vigorous Campaign in the Southern States. We are not in the best Situation to oppose the British Efforts. The great Departments are very deficient in Supplies of every kind, & public Credit will not answer as a Substitute for Money. There are two Obsticles to that Energy and Vigor wch. are absolutely necessary in the United States. In the first Place, the United States have not vested Congress, or any other Body, with the Power of calling out effectually the Resources of each State. The Articles of Confediration give only the Power of apportioning. Compliance in the respective States is generally slow, and in many Instances does not take Place. The Consequence is Disappointment, & may be fatal. In the second Place, an extreme, tho' perhaps well meant Jealousey, in many Members of Congress, especially those of a long standing, seems to frustrate every Attempt to introduce a more efficacious System. Prudent Caution against the Abuse of Power, is very requisite for supporting the Principles of republican Governments; but when that Caution is carried too far, the Event may, and probably will prove alarming. We have Experienced a recent Instance of political Diffidance. Mr. Robert Morris of this City has been chosen Financeer. Previous to his final Acceptance, he insisted upon the Power of removing from Office, all Persons entrusted with the expenditure of public Money, for Abuse, Fraud &c. without being answerable, except to the Party injured in the Courts of Law. Without this Authority, he despaired of introducing ceconomy, so esentially important at this critical Situation. A Majority decided against the Proposition.(1) The Consequence is, we are replunged into our old Situation, so agreable to some Gentlemen, and I fear, shall APRIL 2, 1781  Portrait of James M. Varnum  not be able to effect a Reformation in Point of Revinew, & Expenditure, wch. some Time since, many of us hoped, & firmly expected. Sentiments of this gloomy Cast may appear, Sir, to some, as the Result of a fickle, or envious Disposition; But belive me, I should be silent upon such Topicks, if I was not apprehensive of the most serious Consequences. My Duty, or a mistaken Idea of it, obliges me to hazard a Conjecture, That the Time is not far distant when the present American Congress will be dissolved, or laid aside as Useless, unless a Change of Measures shall render their Authority more respectable.(2) Our Time is consumed in trifling executive Business, while Objects of the greatest Magnitude are postponed, or rejected as subversive in their Nature, of democratical Liberty. If political & civil Liberty can be enjoyed amidst the Din of Arms, in their utmost platonic Extent, I confess my own Ideas are perfectly wrong; but if the kind of Government sufficiently energetic to obtain the Objects of Peace when free from Invasion, is too feeble to rase & support Armies, fight Battles and obtain compleat Victory, I know of but one eligible Resort in the Power of the United States. That is to form a Convention,(3) not composed of Members of Congress, especially those whose political Sentiments have become interwoven with their Habits, from a long Train of thinking in the same Way. It should be the Business of this Convention to revise & refraim the Articles of Confediration, To define the aggregate Powers of the United States in Congress assembled, fix the Executive Departments, and ascertain their Authorities. Many other Matters, subservient to these general Ideas Would come before them, and their Powers should be extensive in Point of Ratification; But the System to be by them adopted should, expire at a given or limitted Time. This Plan, if rational & necessary, must be recommended by the Legislature of some one State, or the same Policy which I have mentioned, will prevent a Recommendation taking Place in Congress. It would probably affect some Gentlemen in a Tender Point, as having been in Congress more than three Years, they might be deemed unqualified Members, wch. offends them extremely when even hinted, altho' the Articles of Confederation are very clear upon that head.  By all Accounts, the French Squadron had greatly the Advantage in the late Action off Chesepeak, altho' the British were one hundred & thirty eight Guns superior in Number.

Let me observe to you as a private Friend, the Delegates from Massachusetts are by no means duly informd of what is done in their own State; and when they receive any kind of Information it is not in a Manner adapted to give them Weight. I do not mention this on my own Account; for I intend very soon to take Leave of Congress & get my self excusd from any future Attendance. You mention a certain Juncture when you wish me to return. I think I can discover your Motive and your old Partiality for me. I do assure you, I am not at all sollicitous about any thing of the kind which your Letter seems to intimate. I have always endeavord to confine my Desires in this Life within moderate Bounds, and it is Time for me to reduce them to a narrower Compass. You speak of \""Neglect,\"" \""Ingratitude\"" &c.

When Time enfeebles his Powers & renders him unfit for futher Service, his Country, to preserve its own Vigour, will wisely call upon others; and if he decently retreats to make Room for them he will show that he has not yet totally lost his Understanding. Besides, there is a Period in Life when a Man should covet the exalted Pleasure of Reflection in Retirement.

  [April 3-May 9? 1781](1) Congress see in the Treatment of the honourable Mr Laurens formerly their President, and now one of their publick Ministers, a fresh proof of the sanguinary disposition of the Court of Great Brittain, and of how little Avail in their Estimation are the Laws of Nations, sacred throughout all the rest of the civilized world, when opposed to the Intemperance which marks their publick Councils. It is now well known that Mr Laurens in his passage to Europe was intercepted and conducted to England by a british Frigate: that on a warrant signed by three british Secretaries of State he was committed to the Tower of London; and that a Suspicion of Treason is assigned as the only Cause for his Imprisonment:(2) In short that the whole of this extraordinary procedure is calculated to fix upon this respectable Patriot the Odium and the Consequences of high Criminality.  The Causes of our happy Revolution have so often been illustrated in the publick Appeals of Congress that it is unnecessary to discuss them minutely. It is our greatest Glory that they have produced general Conviction of our Grievances, our Rights & our moderation! A Conviction founded on the Basis of artless Truth, & not to be shaken by the Suggestions of Malice. Is it not from these Sentiments that the profuse offers of our Enemies for Succours, to every power of Europe, upon whom they hoped to make an Empression, have, with very few Exceptions, been disdainfully rejected? Is it not from these Sentiments that we have been supported by the Arms of France and Spain and honourd by the Approbation and good wishes of every Friend to mankind! Indeed the Policy of the british Councils immediately after the Close of the last War-a War rendered succesful by our vigorous Cooperation-  APRIL 3, 1781  can never be viewed without Astonishment and Indignation! While the mouths of their King and Parliament were filled with our Praises, While we were warmed with the Expressions of their gratitude and their unsolicited Grant of a Reimbursement for what it was confessed we had advanced beyond our proportion and our Abilities-An Arbitrary and ruinous System of Administration was adopted for enslaving the Colonies. Without the Shadow of Authority; in defiance of our Constitutions, Charters and Usages, in Violation of our Natural Rights as Men; of our priviledges as freemen; of our Equality as Subjects of one Common Sovereign their Parliament arrogated a Right to controul and dispose of us at their own Pleasure. A Parliament confined to the Representatives of the Freeholders and Citizens of the Island of Great Brittain alone! A Parliament equally indifferent to our Applause or our Resentment; ignorant of our Wants and our Circumstances, enriched by our Oppressions; and in all Subjects of Impost and Taxations independent of the Interference of the common Sovereign. Such a Parliament elevated to office by Venality and exercising its functions under the absolute Controul of a Minister: had the Insolence to declare that they and their Successors coud of right bind the Colonists in All Cases whatsoever, in their Consciences, their Jurisdictions, their Lives, their Liberty, their property! A Discrimination so fatal to social Liberty, and which reduced us from Members of a free Government, to the Condition of Slaves to our fellow Subjects coud not fail of spreading universal Alarm. Before the first Sessions of Congress in 1774 this Parliament had proceeded without Reserve to pass the most irritating & unconstitutional Acts: Such were those for imposing Duties for the purpose of raising a Revenue in America, for extending the power of Admiralty beyond their proper Limits, depriving the American subject of his Trial by Jury, and for creating a new offense in America and subjecting the Accused to be transported for Trial and Punishment to England; and for stopping up the Harbour of Boston Altering the Charter and Government of the Massachusetts bay. To these grievous and oppressive Acts and measures America coud not submit; but it was resolved to try the effect of a Commercial Opposition; of an Appeal to the People and a Remonstrance to the King of Great Brittain. It was not believed that Justice and Humanity coud be banished from an enlightened Nation, or that they who so highly valued the Blessings of Liberty woud persist in the disgraceful office of forging Chains for their Friends & Children. Will future Ages believe that-instead of Redress our Just Remonstrances produced Contempt, a denial of Justice, and a formidable Armament to compell us to unconditional Submission? Is it then seditious that we refused tamely to surrender the Rights of Men, and the Blessings of Liberty, handed down to us by the Virtue and the Valour of our Ancestors? Is it seditious that we  opposed the Strokes of Arbitrary power when we were furiously invaded? Tyrants alone are incapable of discerning the distinction between rebellion and a Just Resistance against intollerable and high handed Oppressions. The Establishment of the Liberties of the Netherlands and the Swiss Cantons; and the Transfer of the Crown of Great Brittain from the Stewart Line to the House of Hanover are Examples of Succesful Resistance against Arbitrary power which are commended and Justified by our Enemies. On the Lawfulness of such Resistance their present Government is established. A wise Prince woud have felt the force of Principles which are the Basis of his Throne. (He woud have perceivd that Patriotism is more than a name since it encircled his Brow with a Diadem. He woud have abhorred the suggestion that a Respect for the Rights of Mankind is incompatible with the Social Duties).  Let us consider the Nature, and the Rights, of a Civil War, according to the Law of Nations; and apply its Maxims to the Condition of the united States: Hence we shall more clearly perceive how destitute of foundation is the Attempt of the british Court to impute to Mr Laurens the Crime of suspicion of Treason, against that Government.  \""If there be War between part of the Citizens on one side with the Sovereign and those who continue in obedience to him on the other it is sufficient that the malcontents have some Reason for taking Arms to give this disturbance the name of civil War and not that of Rebellion. This last Term is only applied to such Insurrection as is void of all Appearance of Justice. The Sovereign never fails to term Rebells All subjects openly resisting him: but where these become of Strength to oppose him so that he finds himself Compelled to make war regularly on them he must be contented with the Term of Civil War.\"" \""Things being thus situated it is very evident that the common Laws of War founded on maxims of Humanity, moderation & probity are in civil Wars to be observed on both sides. The same Reasons on which the Obligation between State and State is founded render them even more necessary when two incensed parties are destroying their common Country. Shoud the Sovereign conceive he has a Right to hang up his Prisoners or to burn and destroy, the opposite party will follow the Example and the War become cruel and horrid.\"" Thus we are taught by the Law of Nations, and how applicable are these maxims to the Events of the present war! Have not the Efforts of the Enemy been serious, powerful and persevering? Have they not wasted the Lives of mighty Armies and expended countless millions to reduce us to Slavery? Have we not in the face of their fleets and Armies and in the high Tide of (3) ""

  Dear Sir Philada. April 3d. 1781 I have received your favor of the 23d of March.(1) The publication of which you wish to have a copy for your private use is not yet finished;(2) as soon as it is I shall take care to provide one for you. I have repeatedly reminded Dr. Smith of his promise with respect to the map,(3) but have never obtained any thing more than a repetition of the promise. He is at present an inhabitant of Maryland. Just before he left this City he assured me that he should soon send me what you wanted. I have not since heard from him and have very little hope that I ever shall on that subject. It is not improbable that he calculates the value of the Chart on its being the single one remaining, and thinks the issuing of copies would depreciate it. The genius of the man and the manner of his behaviour in the course of my applications to him justify such a surmize.  Notwithstanding the personal advantages which you have a right to expect from an emancipation from your present labours and the APRIL 3, 1781  interest you have given me in your leisure by the promise of your correspondence I cannot forbear lamenting that the State is in the present crisis to lose the benefit of your administration. But as you seem to have made up your final determination in the matter and have I doubt not weighed well the reasons on which it is grounded I shall lament it in silence.(4)  The letter from the Delegation by the last post informed you of the arrival of the Stores here which were to have been delivered in Virginia by one of the French Ships.(5) The infinite importance of them to the State, especially since the arrival of a reinforcement to Arnold of which we are just apprized by the Marquis has determined the Delegates to forward them by land without loss of time. This will be attempted in the first instance in the channel of the Q. Master's Department and if it cannot be effected in that mode without delay we propose to engage private waggons for the purpose on the credit of the State. Should the latter alternative be embraced, I find it will be necessary to stipulate instantaneous payment from the Treasury on the arrival of the waggons at Richmond in Specie or the old Continental Currency to the real amount thereof. I mention this circumstance that you may be prepared for it. The expence of the transportation will be between five & six hundred pounds Virginia Money. The exchange between specie & the old paper here at present is about 135 for 1.  The Delegates having understood that the Refugees taken by Capt: Tilly on his return to New Port from Chesapeak consisted chiefly of persons who formerly lived in Virginia, some of whom were traitors who deserved exemplary punishment, and others vindictive enemies to the State thought proper to make the inclosed application to the French Minister.(6) By conversation I have since had with him on the subject, I doubt whether it will be deemed consistent with their general rules of conduct to give up to be punished as malefactors any of the captives made by their fleet which does not serve like their land army as an auxiliary to the forces of the United [States]. If these persons had been taken by their land forces which serve as auxiliaries under the Commander in chief it seems there would have been no difficulty in the case. However the application will certainly prevent the exchange or release to which it refers, if the Executive think it expedient to do so. On the least intimation I am persuaded the Apostates would be even sent over to France and secured in the most effectual manner during the war. Perhaps this would not be amiss as being not our Prisoners no use can be made of them in redeeming our Citizens from captivity.  About one thousand of the Pennsylvania line will march in a day or two from York Town for the Southern service. When the remainder will follow them is altogether uncertain. The detachment under the Marquis is still at Annapolis. The orders of General   Washington will govern their movements. Whatever his intentions mig[ht have] been at first, I flatter myself the embarkat[ion from] (7) N. York of which he must have been soonest [apprized] & which is now lodged in Chesapeak has dete[rmined] him not to withdraw them from a service wh[ich is] now more in need of them than ever.  The Ordinance published in the Newspaper [of this] day will be an answer to your request by Col. Harr[ison of the] sense of Congress on .one of the subjects to which it rela[tes.(8) The] flagrant abuses which were covered by those indulg[ences] and the offensive light in which they were justly viewed by our Ally called loudly for their abolition.  I am Dr Sir, yr. sincere friend & servant,  James Madison Junr.(9) ""

Excellency shall be informd of as soon as tis decided.(1) The Unfortunate consequences which have attended the Naval engagement of Chesapeake on the 16th Ultimo, we feel with unspeakeable regret, as they have snatchd from us the pleasing prospects we had cherished for some time past, of frustrating the Sanguine project of the Enemy (of subjugating most of the Southern States this Campaign) and thrown our Country into a Situation which must require her utmost exertions, with all the aid that can be sent her to extricate her from. This we shall leave no means unessayed to effect, on our parts.  The Same unhappy event, has deprived us of the immediate Use of the Arms and Stores, which were to have gone from Rhode Island (the Cargoe of the Comite) on board a french frigate, but we have the Satisfaction to Inform yr. Excellency that they are safe arrived at  APRIL 3, 1781  this place, in the Frigate which was to have Carried them to Virginia.(2) We have orderd them to be landed and have taken the necessary Steps to forward them with all possible dispatch by a safe Route to Virginia, having committed them to the Care of Col. Febiger,(3) under the direction of the board of War but it is with much concern that we find on this as well as on many other occasions where we might yield considerable service to our Country on pressing emergencies, the want of Small Sums of Money is frequently an insurmountable obstacle to a speedy execution of our intention, and the important matters which engage our attention in Congress, interferes with the necessary attention, required by such objects when the ready means of executing them are no[t in our hands.] The Remedies to these inconveniencies we leave to the Wisdom of Yr.

In a surviving letter fragment probably written on April 10, for which see Madison, Papers (Hutchinson), 3:65, the delegates also informed the governor of an exchange of letters that they had had with Simon Nathan and requested further instructions concerning Nathan's new demands.

Nathanael Greene to expedite the procurement and shipment of supplies to the southern department. When the goods from Le Comite' arrived in Philadelphia, the Virginia delegates reminded the Board of War of its responsibility under Congress' October 1780 directive to transport the goods. The Board quickly discovered that the wagoners to be employed refused payment in either Virginia money or tobacco, whereupon the Board recommended and Congress agreed this day that the treasurer issue a warrant for $995 in the new emissions to Col.

  Sir, Philadelpa. 3d April 1781 Your Favour of the Ult. inclosing some Act of our Ligeslature &c have been recd. I have Nothing in Return to inform you of but what you will find in the inclosed Papers, except that after the British Fleet had left the Cheasepeak as Mentioned in the publick Prints, they Met a Fleet with Transports from N York having or it is APRIL 3, 1781  said about 1,500, or 2000 Troops on Board with whom they returned into the Bay. I do not hear that the Troops have landed or that any Material Damage has been done by the English Shipping. No News from Europe since Decr.  The old Money here is continually sinking. Exchange is 135 for one. Vast Quantitys of this Money has been and is going on to the Eastward where the Exchange is not so great. But that will probably Not long be the Case. This Money Exerts the approbrium of America-and I always thot We ought to get rid of this Dishonour by cancelling the Bills as soon as possible. This I have long been convinced will not be effected by Taxation. Some other equitable Mode ought therefore to be adopted to put an End to that Speculation & Injustice which is not only practiced by Individuals but by one State to Another. The Act of the 18t of March in its great Principle in my Apprehension was just and Necessary to be adopted. I wish that it had been farther extended. But the Ignorance and the insidious and unworthy Veiws of too Many Individuals perhaps rendered a more extensive Plan inexpedient. But Justice and publick Necessity will before long compel the States to adopt Measures more definitive with respect to their Money.  This State has passed a Bill Vesting Congress with the Powers to Collect the Impost precisely According to their Requisition, this Day it is said that it will be passed into a Law of the State without scarcely any Opposition. I was much Surprized that Connecticut has adopted this Measure in so partial a manner not only as I am fully convinced that it is the only Mode by which a Tax of this kind can be equitably laid. But as our State consumes much more than they Import they have a particular Interest in adopting the Measure. Certainly they cannot Wish to pay large Dutys in N York and Boston for the particular emoluments of those States which will be the Case unless the Dutys are applied for National Purposes. This Plan will not collect a large Sum (it might perhaps have been farther and more beneficially extended), But as the Dutys are defenite there can be no Danger that Trade will be improperly Burthened, and as the Revenieu tho' not large would be certain and increasing, it might have done something considerable towards putting publick Credit upon a better Footing-tho farr Itself from being Adequate.  My domestick Affairs are such as that I shall judge it my Duty to leave Congress soon. I expect to be at Home about the 20th of this Month. I am Sir with respect, your Most Obedt. Servt,  Oliver Wolcott NB. The Legislature of this State are I am informed about to Emit 300,000 pounds on their particular Credit. The Bills Will be well funded on Property. They do not collect in the old Money Very fast. I cannot Say what the precise Sum of the New Money is which has been Emitted-it passes about five for one compared with Specie.  APRIL 4, 1781  Altho the Tender act still continues-and which this Assembly do not think proper to Repeal. My best Compliments to Mr Ellsworth. I write in hast. Excuse Errors.

I assure you, Sir, that I have not seen a French dictionary since I arrived in Philadelphia, and I am persuaded that I shall learn much under the eyes of so capable an instructor.

The President of Congress has ordered Mr. Hazard and Mr. Bache to send the post by the route behind the mountains of New Jersey to New Windsor, to cross the river at Fishkill, and to continue the route by Litchfield to Hartford, but they have continued to send them by The Clove to Peekskill, to cross the river there, and from thence to follow the river to Fishkill.

Ere this reaches you, you will have heard of the operations of the French & British fleets on this coast-the former, altho disapointed, deserve great praise.  Not a word of the arrival of the second division of French nor of the cloathing & Stores for the Army. Inclosed I send you a copy of an enquiry and report of the board of Admirality on that and other subjects,(2) to show that the blame does not lie on Congress nor Docr. Franklin. Of this the Army and the Legislature ought to be acquainted.  The copy would have been certified by the secretary of Congress, but you will observe that it is not their act, only an enquiry & report for their information. It is nevertheless a true copy which I have procured for your particular information.  We have not heard the effects, in Europe, of England's declaring war against the united provinces-their Navy must be greatly weakened by the captor of so many seamen as England must take before they can look about them.  I am in great haste the express waiting.  Be so obliging as to make my best compliments to the Officers under your command.  With the highest sentiments of esteem and respect I have the honor to be, Dear Sir Your most Obt. Humble Servt.  Wm. Sharpe ""

  Dear Sir. Philadelphia, April 8th, 1781.  I fear from our disappointment of succor from the fleet of our ally under the command of the Chevalier D'Estouches, that the enemy will be able to establish a strong post at Portsmouth, and maintain it APRIL 8, 1781  during the summer, unless the arrival of the second division of the French, which we hourly expect, should give us the superiority at sea. In other respects our prospects are far from being flattering. You will easily judge that great delay in the deliberative councils of so numerous a body as Congress must necessarily take place, add to this, that the frequent change of the members does in almost every instance break upon the best digested systems, and renders inefficient the best concerted measures. Much time is too often spent in debate, and there is no man of sufficient credit or influence to take the lead, or give a tone to the business. Another circumstance which prevents Congress from taking its measures with a greater degree of confidence and decision is, the inattention which the States pay to the measures recommended by that body. I am fully satisfied that if the States would implicitly comply with every requisition of Congress, even when the propriety of the measure was not evidently apparent, it would be attended by the most salutary consequences, as there is not the least reason to doubt but Congress, both as a body and individually, are disposed to do what is right, and appear to me in almost every instance that has fallen within my observation to be actuated by the most virtuous and disinterested motives. In a few, very few instances, I have suspected individuals to be influenced by local or personal considerations, and this less often than might be naturally expected in so large a body.  Never was a poor fly more completely entangled in a cobweb than Congress in their paper currency. It is the daily subject of conversation in that body; but our situation is so very intricate and delicate that I have as yet heard no proposal that is not subject to numberless objections. Dr. Burke, who is to be the bearer of this, has just called to tell me he is not to leave this for some days.(1)  MS not found; reprinted from McRee, Iredell, 1 500-501 1 For the continuation of this letter, see Johnston to Iredell, April 12, 1781.

  Sir, Philadelphia April 9th. 1781. Your Excellency will receive enclosed an act of Congress of the 8th Instant recommending to the Executives of the States of Delaware, Maryland & Virginia respectively to take immediate measures for the removal of all public stores, and also all provisions & forage public & private which will not be necessary for the consumption of the Inhabitants on the Peninsula between the Chesapeak and Delaware Bays, to prevent such articles falling into the enemy's hands. I should suppose it equally expedient to include valuable horses tho' they are not mentioned in the Act.(1) This recommendation is in consequence of intelligence received APRIL 10, 1781  from New York the substance of which is prefixed to the enclosed act, although it is presumed you will have received the intelligence before this comes to hand.  As future events must determine with certainty the designs of the enemy, so future intelligence may influence the measures now recommended, yet it is to be hoped such precautions may be taken as will prevent any valuable supplies of any kind falling into the enemy's hands should they attempt to execute their designs as reported.

I have directed a Person to whom I wrote by that Express (1) to make application to you for assistance in a Business which I desire to have done for me either immediately or at your own Time according to Convenience and the Promotion of my Views as explained to you in a former Letter by Mr. Brown and also in one by Doctr.

This does the Genl. great Credit as a private man of Justice, but there is a Design in Jemmy to make a Coolness between our Commander & the french, because Genl.

  My Dear Sir,(1) Philadelphia 10th April 1781. I wrote you a few lines the 22nd of last month, (2) which I hope will reach you in due time.  I have been uneasy for some time past, at not receiving a line from you, the last I got was dated so far back as the 15th Decr.-and have been greatly at a loss to know where to find you, after the Retreat of Genl.

I sincerely hope you have long since recovered and will in future enjoy a great share of health & evry other happiness this World can afford you.  I send this Letter, as I did two others, to the care of Colo. Dart and requested of him to forward them to you with all convenient speed. I wish you may meet, as he can inform you of many circumstances & of the situation of most of our acquaintances in Carolina-he has seen several Persons from thence. I have not had a Letter from Polly since the middle of November, but have had the satisfaction to hear since, that she and the rest of our dear Relations & Friends were well, the latter end of January. I am very unhappy on their account and more so, as I see no speedy prospect of extricating them out of their difficulties-tho' I cannot help mentioning to you, in Confi- dence, that there is great reason to expect the second division of the French Fleet will be here soon, in which case, I flatter myself our Affairs to the Southward will be in a good way-the exertion of the Southern Delegates in Congress will not be wanting in effecting evrything that will contribute to the expulsion of the Enemy from our native Country. The situation of Lord APRIL 10, 1781  Cornwallis and his Army is very critical, and I must own, I am very sanguine in my Expectations, that Genl. Greene will [prevent] him from making his Retreat good and in the end cut his Lordships Army all to pieces. By Genl. Greene's last Letter, he appears to be in high spirits and I think he now has an opportunity of doing something capital-tho' he was obliged to quit the field of Battle near Guilford Court-house on the 15th ulto., yet the day was in our favour from the heavy loss the Enemy met with in that Action and it has proved so from the precipitate Retreat of their Army. God grant us a successful Campaign this Year and then I shall not despair of having a Peace on honorable terms to America.  The failure of Monsr. des Touches not getting into Chesapeake Bay, has rather damped our Spirits and does, for the present, secure the Traitor Arnold in his strong hold at Portsmouth and 'tis reported, that a strong embarkation is preparing at New York to re-inforce him, others say, that [it has sail]ed for Delaware Bay & that Genl.

  [April 12, 1781](1) A Letter from Genl. Washington being read (2) Sitting forth that there was the greatest Necessaty for the detachment of 1200 Men Under the Marquis now at the head of Elk, and the Pensylvania line To go to the Southward, and that he was fearful they Could not go &c with pay &c.  In this Case it appeared that the detachment under the Marquis, as well as the Pensylvan'a expected pay to be advanced them beside paying up arrears-And it did not appear that there Was Money in the Treasury Sufficient for this & other purposes Without Calling for the 6/10 of the new Money Subject to the Order of Congress; And that a Sufficient quantaty of the old Money had not yet been recd. To enable them to Call for this portion of the New Money agreable to the Resolution of the 18th of March. However a Motion was Made that Congress Should Call for the Whole 6/10 of the new Money immediately-and it was argued by the Movers That it was absolutely necessary that the Troops Should March immediately to the Southward, that they Would not March Without the pay & arrears APRIL 12, 1781  Which they expected-And that Congress had no other Means of paying them but by Taking and applying that Money. This was Warmly opposed because it was alledged that it Would Totally subvert the intention of the Resolution of the 18th of March beside that the Money in question being Issued by the Special authority of the respective State Congress Could not Take it Contrary To The Tennor of their Laws-after a Multitude of arguments on both Sides this plan Was Set aside-and another introduced. It was Alledged that the Assembly of Pensylvania had appointed a Committee to borrow as Much of this Money of Congress in The Loan office of that State as would pay their line & that they Would repay Congress again by the first of June, and by this Consent of that State Congress Might draw that 6/loth of the new Money and therefore it was Moved that Congress Should lend the State of Pensylvania four hundred thousand Dollars on the Condition of their paying it again by the first of June-to enable the State to Satisfy their Troops that they Might March immediately to the Southward and the necessaty of the Case Was Strongly urged to induce this. But it Was objected That this Would give Pensylvania an undue advantage of the Other States-and that there Could be no reliance on that States repaying the Money, or they Would have provided for This exigency before this Time as it was known To them so long ago-That Twenty eight Thousand pounds Would pay those Troops, therefore the Sum Mentioned Was More than necessary and indicated Some other applications-But that at any rate If Congress paid those Troops out of their Own Money, or Lent it To Pensylvania Which is the Same thing it Would Occasion a Mutiny in the other Troops Who had a right to expect as Much of Congress as those of Pensylvania &c. &c. &c. The Arguments on this Subject Took of the day and at last the plan Was rejected, & Two other plans offered by a Gent. from Virginia & one from Masichusats Was referred To a Committee of five.(3)  It is to be lamented that Congress is So deficient in the abilities of Financing that No Member is capable of offering a System that is Worthy the Establishment of Congress None Whose Idea's are at the Same Time both Simple & Systimatical enough for this purpose. Both the plans now offered are deficient in this respect. They are both Too Complex and incoherent To be admited-therefore will probably Occasion Much debate and no Effect. While our affairs related to Simple Constitutional questions only the Americans appeared great indeed because every Man Was naturaly raised up a midst the Most pure & Clear principles of Liberty that ever has been practiced or enjoyed by Society, But having paid very little or no Attention to the Study of useful knowlidge farther than was Necessary To Conduct their Own Occupations, Now Their Matters has grown Complex and extensive they appear unable to Conduct   Them in the best Manner, notwithstanding the advantages of Litrature, & the Sciences Which they have Made a rapid progress in And are not deficient on that Account. This has Confirmed me in what I always thought best, that is, that the Study of useful knowledge is of much greater advantage in the great Affairs of State as Well as in the Common business of life-and that a refined and even extensive knowledge in the Languages & Sciences is of very little use unless Connected With, and used as the Aid of useful knowledge. That is a right understanding of men & things, Their passions, dispositions, properties, qualities, and use-Considered both Simple & Compound-by practice and Experiment regulated by Theory as near as May be.

I read yesterday evening the letter which was published by Mr. Rivington under the name of General Washington.(1) I do not think that it was written by His Excellency, but if it were there is nothing that can give the least uneasiness to the Commanders of the army and Fleet of the King. He said that it was very unfortunate that the entire French Fleet did not go out at first with the land troops instead of one ship of the line and two frigates (as he had proposed) because if that had been done at the required time Mr. Arnold with his Army would have been captured; but this little fleet could do nothing without the land troops. It happens every day, sir, that the greatest Soldiers think very differently on the same subject, and success is not always the best proof of the Wisdom of their measures, nevertheless the world in general forms its Judgment according to Results.  I think the General mentioned this affair, but not with the same expressions that are published in the Royal Gazette. I am Surprised that Mr. Rivington did not add more; he published in another Gazette a Letter from the General to Congress, in which he asked the permission to withdraw from the Service of the United States. He published also the answer of Congress to this letter; neither of which ever existed.

  Aprill 13th, [1781] Great part of the Time of Congress being Taken up by the Consideration of Various Officers & others particularly for Money it Was now, in Substance resolved that Such applications hereafter Shall be Made In the first Instance To the Auditors, Treasury &c. &c. To be Adjusted and allowed by them agreable To general principles Directed by Congress from Time to Time.  A resolution was Moved by Genl. Varnum Introduced by Words like the Man himself Arora borialis fine indeed but not well adapted To the Occasion for Confering on John Paul Jones What he Well deserved-The thanks of Congress and a Gold Meddal, for his truly brave & Splendid Action as a Naval Officer.  These favours were opposed in Some Measure as untimely by that Cautious Senator S. Adams-Who only urged that Such favours being the highest in the power of the States (and Next to those of Heaven) ought to be granted With cautious delibration. But it was Alledged that those Services for Which these favours Were urged had been known to Congress & the World that no further diliberation was necessary. However as the resolution wanted amendment it was Committed.(1) Money in its use is only a Medium or Standard by Which the Value of all the articles of Trade & Commerce are Compaired-And assertains the price as scales & Weights does the Weight Upon this principle gold and Silver has been found the Most usefull and Convenient for that purpose, and therefore has been universally adobted by all Trading & Commercial people from the earliest knowledge of its use.  Previous To the revolution, there not being enough gold & Silver Money in America To Serve as a circulating Medium The deficiency was Made up by paper Money, Which being issued in Such quantities only as was found absolutely necessary for that purpose and redeemable by Certain funds, it always passed at the Value Stamped thereon in all the provinces Where these essentials Were adhered To. But in New England Where they Issued Too Much on Account of the last War the Money depreciated To 1/20 part of its Nominal Value.  Upon the Commencement of Hostilities between great Brittain and America, The Congress finding that the greatest part of the Specie had been Sent out of the Country, and that this Together with the Total Stoppage of Trade put it out of their power To lay Taxes, began To Issue paper Money upon No better fund than their pledging the faith of the States that it Should be redeem'd with Specie agreable to the Value Stamped on the Bills. The Virtue of  APRIL 13, 1781  America co-operating with the neccessaty of the Case prevailed So far that while this Money amounted only to the quantaty of a necessary Circulating Medium it passed Current in all the Colonies at its nominal Value-till 1777. But Congress finding they had Such a ready & easy fund To Support the war neglected the OEconomy & other Steps necessary To keep the quantaty within these bounds- And the Staff & purchasers for the Army finding how they Might lavish it away and amas fortunes Took advantage of the Case, and Made Occasion for Such large emissions that the quantaty soon began To Co-operate with the endeavours of the disaffected, in depreciating it. And congress Took no Wise or Valuable Step to Check or prevent this 'Till Too late, and then every endeavour they Made Was So unfortunately Contrived that it Still increased the evil. Tender Laws were Made, Two large emissions were called in-all increased the doubts & fears of the people respectg the Money. Congress then confirmed the depreciation by Settleing a regular Scale as far as 40 for one-and Stoped issuing at the Sum of 200,000,000 Dollars.  The depreciation Still proceeded rapidly So that the Taxes Collected for publick use Would not answer the demands and the Congress pressed by Necessaty adopted the System of the 18th of March 1780. This being Materially defective in Several things and particularly in having the execution of it Committed to the respective States, they proceeded upon it in different Modes So that the good effects that Might have flowed from it were in a great Measure lost by this means. And now that the States are in the utmost distress for want of Money they feel little or No releaf from that System- because they Cannot Command the use of the new Money for want of the old having Timely exchanged-and What they have being depreciated in the very issuing by Tying it to the old Money at a Certain exchange which differs in Most of the States &c. &c. &c. it does not answer the wished for purpose. When we Consider the use of Money-and what it is that Makes it useful it is no Wonder that our Revolution paper Money has all failed-There not being any essential fund To Support it.  We are therefore now greatly in debt, and have not Money To pay them; and most that has been paid Since the Money depreciated, have been Cheated by this Means out of What was their Just dues. And the rest have no Certain Security for What is due them only a late resolution of Congress that they Shall be paid the real Value of their debts.  Suppose then that all the debts now due from the United States to Individuals Should be duly liquidated at their Value in Specie and the Creditors receive Publick bills or Loan office Certificates Promissing payment in a few years With interest annually-And the united States provide a fund immediatley by an impost on Goods or  APRIL 14, 1781  Otherwise for the Certain payment of both interest And principle agreable to the Tener of Such Bills-And at the Same Time provide a fund for Carrying on the War by Laying a Land Tax of one penny per Acre or More if necessary for repayin any Sum (with a anual interest) that they May have Occasion to borrow for that purpose- The principle to be paid in 7, 10, or 15 years &c.

Mr. Sharp one of the Admiralty Members Said that the papers produced by Captn.

  Sir Philada. 15 April 1781  There is Nothing new at this Time either from Europe or from the Southward, except what is contained in the Gazette extraordinary of the 10 inst from New York, (1) which I doubt not, you have seen. What is said respecting the Portuguese war, and the Assistance which Russia has agreed to give to Great-Britain, may be true because it is not naturally impossible, but it is not supported either by Fact or Probability which has come to my Knowledge.  I beg Leave to urge to Your Excellency the immediate and evident Necessity of altering the Exchange of the Continental Currency. I do not think we ought to wait for Pennsylvania, especially when they appear to be pursuing a line of Conduct so generally disapproved, and, as far as I can judge, I must beg Leave to add, not easily reconcileable to Fairness and Honesty, and the Intentions of those who vested the Power. The Stationary Condition of the legal Exchange, while the popular or mercantile is moving foward, must inevitably ruin the State-or lawful Money, because it will be utterly impossible to bring it back again to the value from which it depreciates. Whatever Reasons induced the fixing it at 75 in November last now certainly require it should be fixed above 100. If suffering it to stand will hurt the new Money, and altering it will probably, I think it will absolutely, help it, what Justification can be given for not altering it? That it will take Money out of the State is a Mistake. Everyone knows that though the legal Exchange here is 75 no Man deals at less than 140. I am with great Respect, your Excellency's obedt Servant. W C Houston  ""

  Dear Sir Philada. April 16th. 1781 The inclosed paper is a copy of a report from a Committee now Iying on the table of Congress for Consideration. The delicacy and importance of the subject makes me wish for your judgment on it before it undergoes the final decision of Congress.(1) The necessity of arming Congress with coercive powers arises from the shameful deficiency of some of the States which are most capable of yielding their apportioned supplies, and the military exactions to which others already exhausted by the enemy and our own troops are in consequence exposed. Without such powers too in the general government, the whole confederacy may be insulted and the most salutary measures frustrated by the most inconsiderable State in the Union. At a time when all the other States were submitting to the loss and inconveniency of an embargo on their exports, Delaware absolutely declined coming into the measure, and not only defeated the general object of it, but enriched herself at the expence of those who did their duty.  The expediency however of making the proposed application to the States will depend on the probability of their complying with it. If they should refuse, Congress will be in a worse situation than at present: for as the confederation now stands, and according to the nature even of alliances much less intimate, there is an implied right of coercion against the delinquent party, and the exercise of it by Congress whenever a palpable necessity occurs will probably be acquiesced in.  It may be asked perhaps by what means Congress could exercise such a power if the States were to invest them with it? As long as there is a regular army on foot, a small detachment from it, acting under Civil authority, would at any time render a voluntary contribution of supplies due from a State, an eligible alternative. But there is a still more easy and efficacious mode. The situation of most of the States is such, that two or three vessels of force employed against their trade will make it their interest to yield prompt obidience to all just requisitions on them. With respect to those States that have little or no foreign trade of their own, it is provided that all inland trade with such states as supply them with foreign merchandize, may be interdicted and the concurrence of the latter may be enforced in APRIL 16, 1781  case of refusal by operations on their foreign trade.  There is a collateral reason which interests the States who are feeble in maritime resources in such a plan. If a naval armament was considered as the proper instrument of general Government, it would be both preserved in a respectable State in time of peace, and it would be an object to mann it with Citizens taken in due proportion from every State. A Navy so formed and under the orders of the general Council of the States, would not only be a guard against aggressions & insults from abroad; but without it what is to protect the Southern States for many years to come against the insults & aggressions of their N. Brethren. I am Dear [Sir] Yr. Sincere friend & obt. servt.  J. Madison Junr.  ""

  Dear sir, Philadelphia April 16. 1781. I mentioned in my last,(1) that by the first good opportunity, I would communicate to yr. Excy. some thoughts respecting the present political state of affairs-such as they appear to me- perhaps my opinions may differ, from the generallity of your correspondents, as I know many are but too apt to keep their eyes contantly fixed on the pleasing side of the picture, & feel an aversion to take a View of the reverse, or if they do, endeavour by the most specious colourings to extenuate it's deformities, & if possible cast a veil over the whole. The lines I now address to your Excy. will convince you, I am not one of those botchers, I represent things as they really are. Your station sir, entitles you to the most unreserved communications. The friendship you have done me the honor sir, to entertain for me, demands it of me. Yet it is with reluctance I enter on the task, well knowing your Patriotic bosom is already, sufficiently torn with the embarrassments you daily encounter, and pants for some friendly hand to pour balsam into the wound, but still is incapable of shrinking from increased pain. Accept this apology most worthy sir for the unpleasant theme, which justice to your conspicuous station bids me discuss in the most p[l]ain and unequivocal (manner) language. APRIL 16, 1781  I have for some time past contemplated the state of our affairs with extreme anxiety, which was not a little increased by the contents of your last letter to Congress:(2) the information it contained; astonished me, as we had been repeatedly told, that the battalions eastward of Hudsons river were nearly compleated. What must the friends of America think of their cause when they see so small a body as twelve hundred men(3) collected for a particular purpose, & the United states cannot command as much money, as will enable them to march?-another body of men ordered to march (4) & such a disposition manifested by them, that there was not time to wait your orders, but the interposition of a collateral power became immediately necessary to stop them, to prevent further evils? When our creditors are daily clamouring around us, for their just dues, & those excuses so long held out to them for with-holding payment, can no longer be made use of with the least degree of propriety? Our army-God knows how long-in arrear for their pay, & I must fear will, in a very little time, be in want of bread?-as this state informed us, they could purchase no flour, unless we would lend them the money. The army not only in want of pay, but almost every necessary? the southern army, literally in want of every necessary? no manner of preperations going forward for military stores for the ensuing campaign which is coming fast upon us, nay, which may be said to be arrived-Although we daily expect the arrival of a large reinforcement from our Ally, which we solemnly engaged to be in respectable condition to Co-operate with, on their arrival? Were I to enter into minutia, I should tire your patience in pursuing the black catalogue. Enough has been said. This sir is the true picture of our affairs, and I do boldly assert that Congress have not a single means in their power, to remedy either the one or the other of these accummulated evils, and what is above all, worse, their does not appear to me a disposition to endeavour at it. Whenever the subject is brought forward, men seem to shrink from it as if the case was desperate.  It is true, Congress have called on the States for 6,000,000 of dollars-they calculate upon 4,000,000 out of the new money-as well as upon 5,000,000 from the Court of France. These sums, together with the specific supplies, are the funds on which we depend for the support of the present campaign. Now let us examine for a moment what prospect there is of their productiveness. As to the first, little or no relyance is to be placed on it, because, they are now in arrear 6,400,000 dollars specie & I know of no measures that have been taken to procure it. To the second: 1,000,000 is already spent, the three southern states can emit no part of theirs, New York can do very little, & this State has damn'd the plan, & adopted one of their own, for emitting literally state money, which will not begin to operate before the first of June. So   that make the best of it, we cannot calculate upon more than 2,000,000, out of this fund, & that comes in so very slow, that it is of little use. To the third, we are now pretty well satisfyed, nothing is to be expected from that quarter, in money I mean. As to the last, you know very well sir it is a plan, that never can regularly feed the army.  When will all this end? In an unsuccessful campaign, I have no manner of doubt. But will this be the least evil to be apprehended? I fear not. Indeed my Dearest sir, I begin almost to despond. Were I to consider my private interest, or that of my state only, I should altogether despair. And clear I am, in my opinion, that unless some effectual, vigorous, & decisive measures are speedily taken, to extricate us, from the labryinth of difficulty, & distress, into which we are at present plunged, all the generous blood that has been spilt in this glorious contest, will have been spilt in vain, & the spirits of those who have so nobly fallen, will stalk terrific through our land, seeking vengeance on those who have so infamously suffered their children to become slaves.  As a citizen of America, as one who has more at stake than any man in it, as one who from our mistaken policy, is debared an intimate knowledge of our affairs, but who, from his station, ought to be acquainted with every thing. By these considerations I say sir, I have been led to make you these free communications. I know they must give pain to your generous nature, yet I supposed, you would rather wish to be made acquainted with them, than not. Whatever changes take place either for the better, or worse, with yr. Excys. permission, I will inform you of.  Please to make my respectful complements to Mrs Washington, and believe me to be, My Dr. sir, with every sentiment of the sincerest friendship, & highest respect, Yr. Excys. most Obedt. servt. Jno.

Genl Washington in a Letter to Congress of the 12th (1) says he had not receivd any information on the Subject more than what he had from Congress-& is inclind to think Clinton wod not embark a force so considerable as to induce him to take the Command without risking the loss of N York.  The president has a letter from Genl Green the 30th Ulo. from Ramsays Mill abt halfway between Guilford & Cross Creeks.(2) He had left his Baggage & made a precipitate march to strike Cornwallis, who retreated in so great a hurry that he left his dead of their wounds & fatigue unburried; he is retreating to Cross Creek & Wilmington. The war is therefore over in those parts for some little time. If the Supplies sent by the Board of war abt 20 days past reach our Men they will receive some Comfort. I will next post send a list of what were forwarded. I do not Know whether there is more danger of their falling into the Enemies hands, or of our friends who have applied Some that were sent before to the use of the Militia.

  Sir, Philada. April 17th 1781. The inclosed resolution of Congress answers your Excellency's letter of the 26th ulto., relating to the appointment of Col. Davies to the War Office of Virginia.(1) You will observe that it determines his rank in the Army alone, to be the bar to his acceptance of a civil office. Should Col. Davies be willing to give up that, and his place be supplied by one of the supernumerary Colonels, So that no additional expence would accrue to the United States, Congress we beleive would not hesitate to let him retire, without forfeiting any of the emoluments to which he is at present entitled. General McDougal was lately appointed by Congress to a civil Office under the like circumstances with Col. Davies, and as he did not chuse to part with his rank in the Army, the appointment was annulled.  We have been favored with your Excellency's two letters of the 6th & 7th instant.(2) The steps already taken by us & of which you will have been informed, will, we flatter ourselves accomplish your wishes with regard to the Refugees taken on board the Romulus.(3)  Your Excellency will also have seen, by our late letters, that we have not been unmindful of the distressed state of Virga., for want of the stores lately brought hither by the French Frigate. We wish however, that our efforts to foward them had been more successful. Our first plan for the purpose, was the one suggested by your letter. The probable emptiness of your Treasury, and the impossibility of our making our requisite advance to the Waggoners here, led us to substitute the other plan of placing the Stores in the Quarter Masters Channel, and procuring from Congress a warrant for the money necessary for the purpose. He at the same time engaged the attention of Colo. Febiger to the business, who has been very alert in expediting the supplies for the Southern Service. Notwithstanding these precautions we have the mortification to find, that the stores are not yet on their way. Since the receipt of your letter, we have determined to recur to our first plan.  The Q. Master & Colo. Febiger assure us that every exertion shall be used to execute it. They say however, it will be several days, before the waggons can possibly be on the road. According to an estimate of the Q. Master, we shall be obliged to draw on your Excellency for near £500 specie or, as much paper as will be equal to it, at the current exchange, to be paid on the arrival of the waggons.(4) The only paper they will receive is the old Continental bills. The Exchange here is 150 for 1; and the depreciation progressive. Your Excellency's other requests relating to the debts left by Col. Finnie in his department, and the accommodation of Mr. Ross with funds in this place, shall have all the attention we can give them.(5)  APRIL 17, 1781  The Extract of a letter from Genl. Washington, herewith enclosed,(6) contains all the Authentic information received since our last, on the subject of another embarkation from N. York. For some days of late the report has died away into a general disbelief. Some persons just come out of N. York have revived it, with this variation, that it has a Southern object.  We are extremely concerned to inform your Excellency, that the detachment of the Pennsylvania Line, on which our expectations have been so long fixed, are still detained by the want of money. Every expedient within our invention has been tried, without avail, to remove the obstacles to their march; and we have no encouragement that the resources of the State will put them in motion, in less than 8 or 10 days, at the nearest. The detachment under the Marquis de la Fayette, is, we understand, again moving Southward. but we have great reason to apprehend, that the general cause of our embarrassment will at least retard their progress. The Extract above referred to, will give an idea, how far the Commander in Chief is likely to be in a condition to spare other detachments from the Troops immediately under him. By a return lately transmitted to Congress, it appears that he had not rec'd five hundred effective recruits from all the States whose levies were assigned to the Northern Department.  It is pretty certain we believe that the British fleet under Arbuthnot is arrived at N. York from Chesapeak. That of our Ally has certainly returned into N. Port.  On receipt of yr: Excellency's letter of the 8th ult.(7) respecting a plan to be concerted with the States of Maryland & Delaware, for the transportation of supplies to the Southward, we communicated the matter to the Delegates from those States, but they have never been furnished with any power or instructions relative to it.  The Acts of this State, taking off the embargo, are under the same cover with this.(8)  We have the honor to be, with sentiments of the highest respect,  Yr: Excellency's obt and hble Servants  [James Madison Junr.]  [Theok: Bland] [M.

The governor explained to Congress that Davies would decline the office \""unless his rank in the army, half pay for life, land & allowance for depreciation of pay can be reserved to him.\"" To the delegates he pointed out two \""instances of similar Indulgence.\"" George Clinton held a Continental commission as brigadier general while serving as  governor of New York and Alexander McDougall retained his rank as major general while serving in Congress. Jefferson's letter to Congress was read on April 9 and referred to John Sullivan, Meriwether Smith, and John Mathews who reported on the 16th that, while it was incompatible with congressional rules for any army officer to hold a civil office, Davies should be permitted \""to resign...without forfeiting any of the other provisions or Emoluments reserved to officers of Equal rank reduced by the Late Arrangement.\"" See JCC, 19:367n.3, 397-98; and PCC, item 20, 2:259. Congress rejected the exceptional language in the committee's report and affirmed the principle recently applied to Alexander McDougall's appointment as Secretary of Marine, an office that he declined rather than give up his army rank. See McDougall to Samuel Huntington, March 9, note 2; and the following entry. Despite the Virginia delegates' suggestion that Congress would allow Davies to retire without forfeiting his benefits, a second application was apparently never made. Notwithstanding, Jefferson permitted Davies to perform the duties of Board of War commissioner even though he continued to hold his army rank until 1783.

Mr. S. Adams Said that he Was Willing all the Army Should go to the Southward & the Malitia only be left to defend the Eastern States provided they had notice, & it was not Contrary to the plans of the Genl. &c.

  Dear Sir, Philada. 21 t April 1781. The distresses of the Army for want of pay give pain to every patriot but in a more eminent degree to those who by being placed at the head of Government are considered in some measure, as responsible. If their office shielded them from common Calamities, or afforded Support to their Families. If they had of themselves the means of filling the publick Treasury or If the States had complied with their Requisitions the Charge of Severity towards the reformed officers in not paying their Arrears to the time of their reduction woud have given me less pain. As an Individual I can compare my Sufferings, the dangers of the Field excepted, with any Gentleman of the Army. As a publick man I have had my full Share of Anxiety and Care. Conscious of my own Integrity & of my respect and affection for those brave men who have fought the battles of my Country, I feel that I deserve no Reproach. Believe me,.Sir, that to oblige and serve yourself in particular woud have given me pleasure. Nor as far as my little abilities extended have you wanted a faithful Friend whenever your Interest coud be promoted. The Reduction was a general Measure in which you in common with many other worthy & gallant officers participated.(1) I never heard it objected to. The Rule of Seniority was preferred from the difficulty of Selecting as Congress first recommended. It was preferred on military Ideas & Advice. The officers reduced were not paid: the whole Army were unpaid. The Reason is that there was no money in the Common Treasury. And the States tho' earnestly called upon to advance their Quotas of the Arrears have not complied. What coud Congress have done more? What more can they now do?  With respect to the two additional Regiments to be raised in our State I sincerely believe it did not originate from any Scheme to injure you or to prefer favorites. I have understood that an offer was made the State to raise those Regiments on Land Bounties and that it was expected that the men woud be recruited in New England. To this moment I never heard but from yourself who were appointed Officers. Congress in approving this plan paid Attention to the reduced officers it being their wish that they shoud be preferred as far as this Service permitted. Your own Government I am perswaded highly esteem you, and cannot wish to do you Injustice or to APRIL 21, 1781  injure your feelings: and I am upon the whole of opinion that there are Circumstances in this Affair which want Explanation and that when they shall be known you will be more at ease. However that may be rest assured of my good wishes and friendly Services-for I am with great Regard, Dear Sir, Your most Obedient humble Servant,  Jas. Duane  P.S. I have been here a whole year with the Intermission of a short visit to Mrs Duane in her Indisposition. I return home in a few days.

  My dear Sir Philade Apr. 23 1781 I did not receive your favor of the 3d Instt till yesterday; a week later than Letters of the same Date from some others of my Boston friends were brought to me by the Post. As the Subject is delicate, I do not chuse to continue it in this Letter, which is to go thro' a Channel provd from repeated Experience to be uncertain & unsafe. It was for this Reason that I committed to the Care of a private friend, my Letter to Mrs A of the 1st of Feby which she communicated to you. I am glad she did it in a Manner so acceptable-Indeed I never found Reason to doubt her Discretion. What you have written is very obliging & satisfactory to me. I hope to have the Pleasure of seeing you next Month. We will then, after our usual Manner, disclose each others Hearts.(1)  Your Letter of the 31st Decr was not long ago deliverd to me by the Count Charlus.(2) He appears to be an amiable & fine-spirited young Nobleman. After a short stay here, he proceded with the Marqs de la Fayette to the Southward.  You will recollect a Design which I mentiond to you respecting our Friend Mr L ,(3) & the Omission which, we were informd the Evening before I left Boston, had happened thro' Mistake. I early wrote to you & requested your Influence to have it rectified. I have heard Nothing of it since. In my opinion the most essential Interest of the Town of Boston will be servd by it, & therefore I cannot look  APRIL 23, 1781  upon it as a Matter of Indifference. Not being acquainted with that Gentlemen in the early Times of our Contest, I had by some means conceivd an Opinion of him not so favorable; but having had an Opportunity of critically observing him in the late Convention at Cambridge, I am satisfied he is a virtuous Citizen, & possessd of the genuine Principles of New England. That Mr Rivington, if this Letter should fall into his Hands, may not pretend to be at a Loss to know what is here meant, I will inform him that the genuine Principles of New England are Republican-Principles which have been admired by some of the greatest Characters, whom (if he is an Englishman) his Country can boast of.  You & I, among others, have had the Honor of being abusd by Rivingtons Press; A labord Performance has lately crept out, called the Times. I have had a cursory reading of it. It appears to me so much like the Productions of certain Geniuses who figurd in Mr Popes Time, that had the Author been cotemporary with them, a Page might have been added to the Dunciad,(4) to immortalize his Works.

Your tender apprehensions respecting my Health, your instructive Hints as to the Removal of ill-grounded prejudices, and your generous Direction to convert a Part of your Invoice to my own use form a Chain of pleasing Stricture upon my Gratitude. The Blessing of Health will be enhanced by my having Opportunities of employing a Portion of it in rendering you any Services here. The Preservation of an honest independent Spirit will be so much more my Care as it is what tends to prolong your Friendship for me on the Principle of Simularity.  I shall forward your blue Cloth with the other Articles whenever a good Conveyance presents itself. You will find, by the Copy which I inclose of Col. P's (1) Invoice as you desired, that nearly the same Balance of both Bills of Exchange has been kept back from you. The Weather is so bad that I shall not have the Information of Mr. Ross respecting the Deficiency before this letter goes, but I will obtain and send it speedily. I have had a single Line from Col. P since Nov. 18 and you do not mention him in that Letter where you mention having been to New Hampshire.  I have had the mortification to find that Winship left his Baggage at Fish Kills. I fear ill Consequences to Mrs Adams & you. I write to Col. Hughes (2) to find where the two Bundles were which I had sent and to case them in Board, as Friction or Rain would ruin the Lady's Property. I find it very hard to forward even a small Parcell by Horse so long a Way in these Times when even Sulky Boxes are so loaded with \""Limber-Chink,\"" as the Tories call Paper Money, that I have had a letter returned for being more than could be stowed.  I send Doctr. Holten a news Paper with the Pensylvania act in it for a New Emission of money.(3) The old Continental is limited to June 1st and indeed all monies not by Law equivalent to Gold & Silver. They mean to purchase 4/10 of the 18th of March money of other States so as to avoid emitting of their own. If Congress cannot limit State Emissions it is in vain to attempt any Thing continental with a paper medium. The Congress must deal only in Gold and Silver. If the precious Metals are not our only medium or Funds are not absolutely provided for one general Paper I see ten thousand Embarrassments to every public Movement in the War. Can the People expect to be served by Officers, who engage for 50 Dollars Specie per month and are to be paid in Paper under the Idea of Equivalent, unless current Exchange is intended? But, if that Exchange rises every day during the Delay of supplying the public Treasury by Taxes long called for, how can Government furnish any Estimate? and will the People be satisfied wth. eternal Calls in Taxation APRIL 23, 1781  without regular Estimates? Calculate if possible what paper Currency is necessary to pay an Equivalent, on a Variety of future Periods, for the 12 and 16 months Arrearages now due to the army & Civil Lists. The old money, which ought to have died the 1st of April must be destroyed and one Species and another of the remaining Paper must also be abolished as expeditiously as possible according to Circumstances, till there shall become a Demand of paper for absolute Necessities, instead of that Demand which is now so prevalent for mere Purposes of Huckstering in Exchange of Currencies, and which even the well intentioned Citizen is goaded into that he may escape being sacrificed individually during the Term of the prevalent madness.  Randall had arrived in Boston 9 days before yr. last Letter, but he was to deliver what he had in Charge from me to Mr. Otis. Please to present my Regards to Mr. Otis and tell him that Col.

I feel much for her-'tis a severe stroke, to her, poor Girl! I make no doubt you'll give her all the comfort in your power & hope will remain with her as long as you can. I have advised her to return to South Carolina as soon as an opportunity offers. I think she will be best with her Mother & Relations & will be a great means of recovering & saving her Estate. I cannot but think the Enemy will give her possession of it. I am sorry her Husband did not appoint some other Person as Executor, as well as myself, 'tis impossible, situated as I am at present, that I can be of any Service to her. I shall return the will to her by the first safe opportunity and I shod. be glad you wou'd assist in having it proved-it will be best to have it done in Virginia and I have desired her to send me an authentic Copy of it. Cou'd you not contrive to get a Passage in one of the Flaggs, intended to be sent with Necessary's to the Virginia Troops in Carolina? It will be the best way & I suppose you cou'd easily dispose of her Horses and anything else she wou'd not chuse to carry with her.  The Flagg is at last arrived-she came up last Sunday afternoon- Mrs. Gillon, her son Willm., Mr. May, Capt. Gadsden, Major DeBrahm, Majr.

A report prevails here Which gains credit that the fleet from Corke consisting of two or three men of War and 120 ships under their Convoy, had fallen in with a french Squadron of twelve or fourteen Ships of the line, and that very few of the Convoy escaped falling into the hands of our Ally-and a Vessel from Cadiz informs us that War was declared by that nation against the British-& that a Manifesto had been Published by Holland at that Port Authorizing the Dutch to make reprizals on the English Nation before he left Cadiz.

We then understood that your intentions were to lay out the money arising from a Qy. of Tobo. in your hands to purchase the Said arms of the Public and fit them up with all possible Expedition, Paying for them at a reasonable and moderate Price which the board of War shd. ascertain and engage that they shd. be deliverd to the Executive of Virginia, at a moderate profit to yourselves for the Purchase and trouble-we engaging to give you draughts on the State treasury Payable at Sight-at the real Value without your Suffering by any casual intervening depreciation. We are unhappy on account of our suffering Country, on a revisal and consideration of the terms presented in writing, to concieve it impossible that we can on behalf of the State engage on terms, which would be so evidently disadvantageous to the State without promising more expedition, or a more speedy relief, than may probably be had in the common mode, while from the terms you propose the Public will reap no additional advantage but be subject to the payment of the whole expences of fiting and transporting the Arms, of furnishing the money for the payment of the first Cost, and an addition of fifty Per Cent; which being guarded against depreciation is, we consider a profit too great for us to agree to,(3) APRIL 24, 1781  ""

  Sir, Philadelphia, 26 April, 1781. As the fate of Nations has sometimes depended, so that of States may now depend upon events appearing trifling. The irregular situation in which the Citizens of Georgia have been for some time past, has been cause of some uneasiness to us: for altho we know their merit in opposing the Enemy to be equal to any, and are confident that they have given tone to some of the most brilliant actions in that department upon the small scales yet for want of order and direction among themselves, the state for which they act has lost the credit of their exertions, and may lose more.  To remedy these evils, and to render their endeavors more useful in future, we have invested Doctor Brownson with a Brigadier APRIL 26, 1781  General's commission, and given instructions for uniting our people under his command: And we have only to request that you will give the measure efficiency, by approving and protecting it.(1)  With perfect confidence & much esteem, we have the honor to subscribe ourselves your most obedient and very much obliged servants,  Geo Walton.

I am directed to inform you that it was by no Means their Intention in the Recommendation therein referred to, to hold up your Situation as desperate, much less to preclude the Idea of Resistance. The Intelligence they had received led them to apprehend that it was in Contemplation with the Enemy to take Post at New Castle, for the Purpose of a grand Forage on the Peninsula between Delaware & Chesapeake Bays.(1) The Attention due to the general Interest required that immediate & effectual Precautions should be taken to disappoint such an Expedition of its Object; With this View it was recommended to remove from the Reach of the Enemy all Provisions & Forage which would not be necessary for the Consumption of the Inhabitants, a Precaution pointed out by the very Nature of the Case, which was the more eligible as it tended to prevent the Invasion as well as to render it abortive, and which had been adopted in similar Instances without Objection or Complaint.  The Intelligence since received by Congress of the Designs of the Enemy has been so far from rendering the first Plan inexpedient or unnecessary, that it has determined them to give it greater Promptitude & Efficacy by their Resolution of the 23d Instant, of which a Copy is enclosed. The Extent & Strictness of its Execution, as well as of the preceding Act, must no Doubt be governed by Circumstances and by the Discretion of the Executives & the Board of War.  Whatever Respect may be paid to these Recommendations, or whatever may be the Event, Congress will have done their duty.  Your Determination to exert yourselves to the utmost for your Defence, and your Confidence in the Bravery & Affection of your Citizens afford Congress the highest Satisfaction, and they perswade themselves that a Reconsideration of the Steps taken for removing  APRIL 27, 1781  from the Reach of Invaders, the superfluous Provision & Forage, will convince you that they can have no possible Tendency to discourage so laudable a Spirit, or to impede the Effects which may be expected from it.

  Sr. Philadelphia April 27th 1781 Having discovrd that there were a considerable number of Rampart Arms belonging to the U.S. at this place, which have long lain dormant, (having been supposed useless for the Field,) we have found on enquiry that with a small alteration, and fixing Bayonettes to them they are capable of being renderd exceeding good Field Arms; & knowing the necessity of the State for a Supply of that article we have been extreemely desireous to have them alterd and Sent on with all possible dispatch; we flattrd ourselves that this might have been done expeditiously by the Intervention of some Virginia Merchants who had money in this City which they offerd to dispose of for the purchase of the Arms from the Continent; to have them fitted and transported at their own expence, and on their APRIL 27, 1781  arrival in Virginia giving the State the offer of them upon terms yeilding them a reasonable Profit for their trouble and expence in so doing; but when they gave in their proposals to us in writing, we were extreemely Sorry to find that what would yield them a profit, (far short as they informed us of what might be obtaind by vesting their money in other Articles of Commerce,) greatly exceeded any allowance we thought ourselves Justifiable in agreeing they shd. receive, especially when we considerd the low condition of the treasury of the State, and that we must engage the faith of the State for the Immediate advance of one half the Money, and the payment of the other half on the delivery of the Arms. (1) This determined us to embrace an Alternative, which we hope in the End will prove more Eligible; we have in consequence of that determination procured an Order of Congress to the board of War to have two thousand Stand immediately alterd and fitted up for field Service, to be forwarded with all possible expedition to Virginia and the remainder to be sent to Maryland and North Carolina.(2) In order to accelerate this operation, we must entreat your Excellency to devise some means of furnishing to the amount of 1,300 Pounds hard money or its Value in Paper, such as will Circulate in this State; without which we find it will absolutely be impracticable to carry into execution a measure which will be productive of the greatest advantage to the Southern States. For want of some fund in this City we have often found ourselves greatly embarrassed, and frequently absolutely prevented from expediting Succours of whose consequences we are fully apprized to the Southward, and are extremely mortified to find frequently that a very small Sum which would, by being advanced to Waggoners &.c. set them at work; it is neither in our power to advance nor procure, either on our own or the States Credit-it being absolutely impracticable to negotiate a Bill we cannot but think it highly proper to fix an Agent for the State in this City, to be furnished with remittances for such purposes, and to transact many other usefull pieces of Business for the State which not only lays greatly out of the line of the delegates duty, but frequently prevents them from bestowing the necessary attention to the more important interests of the State and of the Union in General. Your Excellency will be at no loss to concieve why a remittance of the above Sum for the present occasion is highly necessary and expedient when we inform you that from the Tardiness of the States in general to pay in their arrearages of taxes, from the impediments to the Issuing the money according to the Resolution of the 18th of March 1780, and from the daily expenditures for carrying on the war the Public treasury is at this moment left destitute of a Single Shilling and has large demands on it which have anticipated what will probably come into it for some months.

  Sir Philadelphia April 30. 1781 The inclosed paper will give you the substance of the latest intelligence Congress have received from Europe. The countenance given by Russia to the united provinces must be productive of very happy effects, it encourages them to enter into the war with alacrity and to prosecute it with vigor. This of course raises up another powerful enemy against G. Britain and enables our generous Ally to give us more substantial aid, than he could otherwise have done. Our affairs at the Court of Madrid wear a more pleasing aspect than they have yet done and we have reason to expect a more earnest friendship from that monarch than he has yet manifested toward us.  The troops and Ships destined for our aid were expected to sail in all the Month of March, the exact numbers of either we are not informed of, but we are encouraged to expect both will be respectable.  We are directed by Congress to communicate to you the complaints that have been made, of a number of the british Officers being suffered to remain in Charles Town on parole when the enemy extend this indulgence with a very sparing hand to our Officers, that you should enquire into the matter and rectify whatever improprieties may have arisen in conducting this business.  It is also the wish of Congress that you would endeavour to negociate an exchange of prisoners and relieve as many of ours as you possibly can, from the horrors of so severe a Captivity as they experience.(1)  You may possibly conceive some embarrassments will arise in negociating this business, least what may be done by you, might  APRIL 30, 1781  militate against the general exchange negociating by the commander in Chief; but as the powers of exchange in your department are by Congress fully lodged in your hands, we conceive it ought not to influence your conduct farther than military duty must enjoin. Policy in our opinion directs every thing to be done in this business that can be done without loss of time as the enemy have already engaged a very large number of our men, (from good authority we are informed between 5 and 600) and are daily engaging more in their service-inevitable necessity drives our unhappy men to quit the service of their country for one they detest, and the policy of the enemy places them in a situation that for ever precludes them from the least chance of returning, being all engaged for the west India service.(2) The inclosed paper(3) will show you the outrageous malice of the enemy against our Officers and the pressing necessity of something decisive being immediately done to prevent so diabolical a measure as is therein proposed to be adapted by them.

I should have wrote you oftner, had not the conveyance been so precarious, but having now a safe one I readily embrace it. I am at present in usual health and hope these will find you and the rest of the family well. Mr. Adams (1) was in a great strait how to return to New England on account of some body to go with him & I consented to let Daniel go with him & he is to return here again & as soon as he returns I shall set out for New England that is as soon as the horse has rested a few days. I don't know that I was ever in a place more disagreeable to me than this, nor even so much.  The enemy are sending reinforcements to the Southward & I hope a kind Providence will disappoint them in their undertaking, and blast them in their attempts against us. Cornwallis has made out to get clear as I was always afraid and said he would. After their action of the fifteenth of March last in which he suffered very much, he retreated toward Willmington in North Carolina through a tract  APRIL 30, 1781  of Country inhabited by tories which Aided him, and opposed General Greene in such manner and the Virginia militia's time being out, that he was obliged to give over the pursuite, otherwise in all probability he must have fallen into or by our hands. It has been reported here that Generals Sumpter & Pigins (2) have taken a post of the enemy in South Carolina called Ninety Six with three hundred Prisoners. Whither it be true I know not, some of the Southern Gentry say they have it so as that they believe it. Ninety Six is about Sixty miles to the east of Cambden and Cambden is about one hundred and twenty miles to the northwest of Charlestown South Carolina. I think the war will be carried on the approaching Summer with as much Vigor as it hath been any Summer since the war commenced on the part of the enemy if we can Judge from present appearances. The Good Lord prepare this people for what is before them. If there was a more general exertion to the Southward of Delaware River and more of the true fear of God than there appears to be we should have more reason to Expect the Blessings of heaven on our endeavours than we now have. However I do not despair of deliverance; I believe we shall be delivered but we may probably be made to suffer many grievous hardships and trials to prepare us for such a mercy as peace.  The little State of Georgia exerts herself greatly, there is near one quarter part of her male inhabitants now in Arms and exerting themselves to drive the enemy from their Country, they have been frequently successful.  Colonel Palfrey has never been heard of nor the Vessel in which he went; it is to be feared the Vessel is foundered and all on board have perished. She was a new and strong Vessel, never at sea before. She had a number of passengers on board.  It is reported here that the Confederacy is taken and carried into New York. She was a Continental Frigate & the best that ever the United States ever had, she was coming from Hispaniola & was in part loaded with cloathing for the Army. There has been another report, that she was retaken and carried into Rhode Island, but I fear this last account is without any good foundation.  Give my love to your mother your brothers and sisters. I wish you and they may the Divine presence and Blessing attending each of you in all your lawful undertakings, and may we finally be admitted into the relms of Eternal day through the merits of the great sacrifice of attonement.

  Dear Sir. Philadelphia, May 1st, 1781. Since my last we have had despatches from our Minister at the court of Madrid as late as the 22d February, which contain a minute detail of his negotiations at that court. They do him infinite honor. I wish it were proper for me to communicate them to you: I am sure the perusal of them would not only afford you great pleasure, but give you a very high opinion of his abilities. Our affairs at that court are in such a train as promises a favorable issue, and I have reason to believe, from the best authority, that none of the European powers discover a disposition to favor Great Britain, except the Emperor and Queen of Portugal. The former, I have reason to believe, made offers of his mediation to the court of Spain, which were not very favorably received. The Northern Powers will certainly support the Dutch. The two extracts of letters of the 22d February and 23d January, published in the paper of the 28th of April, under the Philadelphia head, are from the best authority, and the intelligence may be relied on. It is reported here that General Phillips has taken possession of Williamsburg, and that General Greene has turned off towards Camden. The first is what I have long expected; the latter, I must confess, appears extraordinary, and is what I cannot reconcile to any principle; and though I have the best opinion of his judgment and military skill, I cannot help thinking that Ramsay's Mill, on Deep River, is the most convenient position he could have taken to watch the motions of Lord Cornwallis. I am now very impatient of some one's coming on to relieve me, and am determined to wait no longer than the beginning of next month, and at all events will leave this before the middle of it. Present my love to my sisters, Nelly and the children. Remember me properly to all our friends, and believe me, with the most sincere affection,  Dear sir, your most obedient servant,  Sam.

  Dear sir, Philadelphia May 2. 1781. You will no doubt think it something singular, that the inclosed should be of so old a date,(1) and handed to you with this, but the reason of it is, that it was meant to go by Govr. Rutledge, who intended paying a visit at Head Quarters, but being taken ill, tho' expecting daily to be in condition to prosecute his journey, finding that not likely to be soon the case, I have requested Mr. Duane to be the Bearer of it.  Our last accounts from Europe are very flattering, particularly from Spain. From some circumstances that have lately taken place at that Court, it seems more favourably disposed towards us, than it hath hither to been. And as soon as some late determinations of Congress, can arrive there, we have little room to doubt, but what our expectations in that quarter will be fully compleated.  The decisive measures pursuing by Holland, supported as they are, by the strongest assurances from Russia, places the war in Europe on the most formidable footing against G. Britain Although the Emperor of Germany puts on the appearance of war, (and as, is generally supposed, in favor of G. Britain) Yet it is most likely he will be too much overawed, to enter seriously into it.  How unfortunate is it, that with all these bright prospects in our favor, we have little or no ability to profit by them. However, as you will see Mr. Duane, and who proposes making a full communication to your Excy. of the present state of our affairs, I shall forbear to ingroce your time, with any further observations on that subject.  The inclosed extract of a letter, sent us by Genl. Moultrie, will shew yr. Excy. what a deplorable state our unfortunate prisoners at Chs. town are likely to be reduced to, unless some thing can be immediately done for their relief. We are further informed Ld. Chs. Montagu, has enlisted between 5 and 600 of our Continentals, & was daily engaging more, all intended for the West India service, so that, they must be for ever lost to us. The Committee of correspondence, by order of Congress, have written to Genl. Greene on this subject,(2) to take the most effectual measures to effect an exchange, as far as his powers extend, but its likely he will want some instructions from you on the business.

  Dear General Philadelphia May 2d 1781 I Take the Liberty of inclosing your Excellency a Motion which I intend making in Congress provided it meets with your approbation.(1) I have reasons for this Motion which were not proper in my Opinion to Lay before Congress but which I beg leave to lay before your Excellency. I Suppose it at Least possible That our reinforcement from France may be followed by a Superiour Naval Armament which may Arrive before any thing decisive can be Effected; Should this event take place we shall find ourselves unable to regain a Single Post the Enemy now possess & consequently the Campaign must be lost, unless by Some diversion we can reduce that force at Least to an Equality; & this in my Opinion cannot be So effectually done as by making a Diversion in Canada as they canot reinforce but by water; & This will demand a Convoy of Capitol Ships, but Should not this Event take place namely a Naval Superiority on their Side no injury can Arise from making the Necessary preparations as this will make a diversion in favor of our intended plans in this Quarter and Enable us in case of Disappointment to turn the feint into a real attack. I am clearly of opinion that our whole force Should be employed to regain what we have already lost so Long as there remains a probability of Success: but when the possibility of that Success ceases to Exist we ought not to loose the Campaign & neglect to Conquer Posts completely in our power: because we are unable to gain those we prefer. In Short I am for doing something in case it Should become impossible to do what I most ardently wish, viz regaining the Posts already lost & I submit to your Excellency whether even this will be possible unless the necessary preparations are previously made. These in my opinion may be made without much Expence. The Eastern States may be called upon to Embody some Battalions & make other necessary preparations which in case of a Naval Superiority may be employed against New York & Enable us to Detach from the Main Army to the Southward. I beg your Excellency to Excuse the Length of this letter as it was only my intention when I began to give the hints without going into a Long  MAY 2, 1781  train of reasoning upon the Subject but have been insen[si]bly led into it by perhaps too warm an Attachment to a Plan which your Excellency may convince me is not Eligible.  I have the honor to be with the most respectful attachment, Dear General your Excellencys Most obedt Servant, Jno Sullivan  E N C L O S U R E To the Honble the Delegates of the United States  in Congress Assembled.  Gentlemen when I consider how much this Country has suffered by languid efforts; which instead of expelling the common enemy, have only served to exhaust the treasures of the United States; prolong the war and discourage the Citizens by a series of misfortunes. When I consider that the enemy are now entirely possessed of two States; occupy important posts in several others: and hold uninteruptedly the Province of Canada; containing more territory than all the thirteen United States: and that this Province, which almost encircles them, must from its situation, and by the natural increase of its inhabitants, soon become sufficiently powerful in conjunction with the naval force of Britain, to deprive us of those privileges for which we have so long contended. That a peace ratified by Great Britain at this time, should even every post in the United States be given up to Congress: must finally end in the destruction of our liberties; for a long continuance of peace would only serve to render a conquest over us more certain. As it has ever been allowed that all forms of government which must Eventually end in the ruin of itself ought not to be adopted; so that situation which will in time bring destruction upon those who hold it; ought at all events to be avoided. Should peace be restored even upon the terms before mentioned, the increase of inhabitants in every part of America will undoubtedly be in proportion to the extent of territory in each; and the Province of Canada will undoubtedly from its great extent, the goodness of its soil, and the advantages of its exterior and interior fishery and navagation: have almost as great an increase of inhabitants as the whole of the United States together: of course an uninterupted peace for a number of years, will only serve to accelerate the conquest of them, upon the commencement of hostilities, for Britain will only have to put her naval force in motion and the whole of these States from their situation with respect to Canada will be immediately invested by land and Sea. But should we be compelled to make peace upon terms less favourable, and the enemy be suffered to keep possession of every part of America which they now hold; a long continuance of peace will ensure to Britain without difficulty, that conquest which her arms have hitherto been unable to accomplish.  MAY 4, 1781  These considerations induce me to propose to Congress an immediate invasion of Canada, as the only means of relieving the Southern States, securing the liberty, and independence of the whole; and obtaining a peace upon terms favourable to their interest, to accomplish which no great expence of men or money will be requisite. As the inhabitants of Canada since our Alliance with France are well disposed to second us in the attempt; as that Country abounds in flour and other articles of subsistance for the Army; and the possession of the lower part of Canada will of course reduce every fortress of the enemy on the Lakes, and compell their Indian allies to sue for peace. As a road is now cleared within thirty miles of St Johns and 45 of St Dennies and may be compleated in fifteen days, I would propose that the Duc de Loison's legion, the New Hampshire line, and Hazens regiment, with some batallions of militia from the New England States, and Vermont, not exceeding 6000 in the whole be detached upon this expedition by the first of August next. That cattle only be furnished and sent on as there is a sufficiency of flour in Canada for support of the Army, while there. That the military and ordinance stores be sent from the most convenient posts in the New England States; and that the commanding Officer be impowered to inlist such volunteers in Canada as he may find necessary for making a sudden and complete conquest of the Country.  <<Should this plan be approved by Congress and the Commander in Chief and be thought by others difficult to be carried into execution, though I have no wish to solicit for myself any military employment; I now offer Congress to undertake the Command and to be answerable for its success (unless prevented by some unforeseen stroke of providence or unexpected arrival of a large reinforcement from Britain) provided Congress will for the time restore me to that rank in the Army which an ill state of health compelled me to relinquish and which I should willingly yield up when the Expedition is completed.>  I have the honor to be, very respectfully, Gentlemen, your most Obedient & huml Sert.

The Speculation arising from this measure to the prejudice of this State with the other reasons stated in the inclosed publication by the Executive Council led to their act of the 2d instant therein referred to declaring the rate between the two kinds of money abovementioned to be 175 for 1.(1) The effect of this declaration has been a confusion among the people of this City approaching nearly to tumult, a total Stop to the circulation of the old money, and a considerable Stagnation and increased depreciation of the new. The difference between the latter and hard money is at present vibrating from 4 to 1 downwards. Should the circulation of the former therefore revive, its value cannot exceed 1/700 of that of hard money. The opportunity which this circumstance gives and which we have reason to believe many are already taking measures to improve, of fraudulent speculation not only on the Citizens of Virginia, but on the State itself, is so obvious & alarming that we thought it our duty to set an Express in immediate motion to put you on your guard against the mischief.(2) The inclosed list of prisoners taken by Capt.

Two Ships are Arrived at Boston with Cloathing for the Army purchased by Mr. Jay at Cadiz. We have likewise received Letters from that Gentleman & Mr. Carmichael. The general disposition of the European Powers are favourable to the common cause as far as I am capable of Judging from such Circumstances as have come to my knowledge.  From a variety of intelligence it would appear that General Clinton means to make a Grand Movement so much that many think he will evacuate New York altogether. In favour of this Opinion they say two Ship loads of the Inhabitants have sailed for Halifax, that others have bespoke passages and that some of the principle Inhabitants have sold their Estates at a price greatly under the Value. It is certain that a great number of Refugees from Jersey have returned and thrown themselves on the Mercy of Government.  The Council of this State a few days since rated the State Money, one dollar of the New equal to 175 old Continental. This has produced great convulsions and in some measure stagnated the Currency of all kinds of paper.

  Dear Sir. Philadelphia, May 8th, 1781. I had the pleasure of receiving your letter of the 5th of last month yesterday, under cover from Mr. Neilson, who informs me that Edenton was abandoned by the inhabitants. I am much concerned for them on this occasion, as they must have sustained great loss and inconvenience in their flight, though I flatter myself their apprehensions were greater than their danger. I by no means blame them for taking early precautions for the security of their propery, but I don't think any force could at that time have been employed against them which they might not have found means to repulse; they, however, must be the best judges of this matter, and I have no doubt but every thing was done that was proper on the occasion. Two ships have lately arrived at Boston from Cadiz with clothing for the army. The blockade of Gibraltar is still continued, covered by a fleet of thirty sail of the line. We every day expect the second division of the French fleet, though we have no certain advice of their having sailed. The Dutch are making very vigorous exertions in putting their marine on a respectable footing, and it is very generally thought that they will be effectually supported by the Northern Powers. None of the powers in Europe discover a friendly disposition to Great Britain, except the Emperor, who is kept in check by the King of Prussia. All Europe have their eyes on America, and particularly the Southern States. Much will depend on our exertions and success. The great and sudden fall of the old Continental money has occasioned very great convulsions and dissatisfaction in this city, and has reduced all paper currency to a very doubtful state, very many refusing to have any thing to do with it. We have no official accounts from General Greene or the Southern Army since the beginning of last month. Report says he has turned his face towards Camden-if so, I doubt not he had good reason for his conduct. Mr. Robert Morris is appointed to superintend the finances of the United States. Great matters are expected from this gentleman's abilities. The finances of no country were at any time more deranged or more in want of wisdom and political knowledge to make them effectual.

  Dear Sir. Philadelphia, May 8th, 1781.  I wrote you a few days since by an express to the Governor of Virginia,(1) informing you of the downfall of the old continental dollars of this city. They still lie prostrate, nor is there the least probability of their ever rising. I must repeat my request that you will either come or send some one to relieve me. I should have left the State unrepresented had not so many others been in that situation. All the States to the Eastward of Jersey, and the State of Maryland, are without a vote in Congress, so that some of the most important business cannot be determined on agreeable to the Confederation. The scarcity of current cash makes it difficult to keep the several departments in motion. The pernicious practice of selling foreign bills at little more than half their value, is, for very substantial reasons, laid aside. My particular necessities must be too obvious; I therefore say nothing on that head. We had the misfortune to lose the Confederacy, with a very valuable cargo of clothing and other effects. Two ships, however, with about three thousand suits of clothes from Cadiz, are arrived at Boston. We have, by a great variety of untoward circumstances, been remarkably unfortunate in the transportation of supplies which have been procured from Europe. Mr. Jay has transmitted a full detail of his negotiations at the court of Madrid. They do great honor to his abilities, and promise a favorable issue, indeed, so far as I can collect from such intelligence as I have had access to, there are none of the courts in Europe who discover a disposition favorable to Great Britain, except the court of Vienna; and I think we and our friends have little to apprehend from that quarter. General Clinton's movements at New York still wear a mysterious appearance. They can only be explained by the event. Every circumstance concurs to confirm the opinion that their principal operations will be to the Southward; and appearances are not altogether against the probability of the total evacuation of New York, should our allies be superior in these seas. I think we shall soon do their business; if otherwise, we must be satisfied to stand on the defensive. There have been no official accounts from General Greene of late.

  Dear Sir May 8. 1781 I was not yesterday favored by any Line from you. I have met with severe Injury lately by a Fall as Mr. Adams will doubtless have told you. Should the Weather be fine Tomorrow I may be able to get up to the State House, tho with Pain.  Nothing can exceed the Confusion here as to money. The Bearer Mr. Payne will give you the Particulars. I shall confine the Subject to my own Condition. How is a Delegate here to be supported? Will Mr. Partridge or Osgood bring Mass. State Money? It passes not here. Will they bring old continental? 1200 are given for 1 Spanish, 4 Pensylvania 5, 6, 7 and more for 1 Spanish. Neighbour Wood mends a Watch for a Clerk of the Board of War, and demands 5 hard or 7 State Dollars which according to Council is 7 times 175=1225. Mr. Adams pd. his Washwoman 45 pr. Dozs. May 1. I was confined to my Bed and on May 5 must pay 105 for every 45. These Things make no odds to me where the State pays the Expences. But I am paid 1 1/2 dollar per day for Time & Service, at 40, 75, 100 and I pay it away here not according to Law but Practice at 700 up to 1200. I want a Suit of Cloaths and a Peice of Linnen: But as the Purchase of them would ruin my Family at one Stroke I only have two Patches in the Elbows of my Coat and a new Seat to the Small Cloaths for which I pay 8 State or 1516 which as it is charged to me by the State is perhaps a Fortnight's Pay for Time and Service, tho it is not in Fact here 1 ½ Dollars.  To avoid this Ruin I tell my Family to buy Coin, But they are afraid my Character will be injured if it should be known that I am not satisfied with Paper. But while I aim only at saving myself from Destruction I fear not Censure. Now I go further and ask would it not be better for the State to furnish Coin which may be had for less among you than 100 for 1 than to lay at the mercy of Pensylvania Exchange. Mrs. Millar bruits abroad that Mr. Adams paid her 11 State at 75 instead of 11 hard or the current Exchange of that Sum. I do not think Mr. Adams ever supposed he was on such a Lay as the latter. Be that as it will I knew I was to pay 7 hard Dollars or the Exchange and I have accordingly paid, tho never to the Height of what Silver actually sold at; when I pd. 90 I could sell it at 93, when I paid 130 I could sell at 135 and so on.  But Things are now come to an Extremity. On the 1st of May Exchange was counted to me 180 when I know absolutely that 190, 195, & 200 were actually paid; but if that Exchange was more than twice what it would have cost the State to supply me with Coins what must it amount to if I am to go on paying in paper-now that Exchange is what I have before described? Shall I pay 8400 dollars per Week? If I shd. The Family will not think I do them the same  MAY 8, 1781  Justice as in paying 7 dollars. Indeed, Sir, This is a matter of serious Concern. I presume Mass: will not be content to be without a Voice in Congress, as some States are for many months together, the Expence of her Delegation therefore should be oeconomised.  I have drawn for 12000 dollars, in your Favor. I know not whether any authority hath been renewed by which we may draw. We are not favored with any such since April 24 1780 which I suspect is obsolete. But as Resolves do pass respecting us which we never get I chuse to suppose Something has passed respecting our Support.  I find I have been too long at the Pen. I must to bed. I am in great Pain. This must suffice for Doctr. Holton and Mr. Adams as well as for you.  Most affectionately, J. Lovell  [P.S.] I find I have mentioned nothing as to the Disposal of the Draught. Please to let Mrs. Lovell have what she chuses and turn the rest into Coin the soonest you can. I keep my Family in a continual State of Suffering because I have no Conceptions but that my Account for Time & Service will be settled in a Way the most injurious to me so far as respects all my personal Expences here which do not enter into the List of those intended by the Court to be publickly discharged. I have already explained this. You have felt it tho your Children have not. But none of my Colleagues can feel it so much as I and my Dependents, because none of them have drawn for more than those Expences which stand charged to the public, or for very little more: so that their Pay for Service may be avaredged, and discharged at the Exchange of the Week of Settlement. All the Stuff about Money is contrary to my natural Disposition. I began as early as 19 to have a Contempt of Wealth, and if I afterwards got so far as to take Thought for the Morrow I never suffered anxiety about the third Day. This Discussion now therefore is forced upon me against the Grain.  I inclose some Letters for your Information. You will leave that to Hacker open in Palfreys which you will seal and inclose in that to Mess S & D (1) which you will also seal and deliver to Capt. Smith or any other Capt. bound to France. I am distressed about Palfrey. The Ship was villainously crank.  Ryan is going to settle in Virginia-is gone, I believe. He left the enclosed a few days ago.  ""

  Dear Sir May 8, 1781.(1)  Your Favor of the 26. of April reached me yesterday. Your Troops are coming on \""in large numbers.\"" The General informs you that Tents &c. will be much wanted; and the Court will make their \""usual Exertions.\"" Indeed Doctor I am persuaded that in a comparative View Massachusetts will appear to have been among the most vigorous States; but we are at this moment in the most disgraceful and hazardous Situation from the Backwardness of every individual State. Foreign Troops are to garison West Point because foreign Troops can feed themselves, and are paid. Our Quarr. Mastr. genl. has been obliged to sell some of his provision to enable himself to transport the rest to a Skeliton of an Army in Want of the very Pounds of meat or Flour which he has been forced to part with. If you know of a Compliance with one Requisition of Congress, in Time & Quantity, do let me have it that I may show it to the Delegates of the 12 States who cannot produce a single Instance.  We are in an Uproar here about the Money. Sailors with Clubs parade the Streets instead of working for Paper. The Beer houses demand hard for a Pot of Drink; and all this because the Council have published that the difference between Silver and old Continental was 175, the latter having been sold 180 & 200 for one several Days. Did Massachusetts sink its Quota by the 1st of April? Some States had not then begun to sink a Shilling.  You say Mr. Partridge and Mr. Osgood are coming on: I ask with what money in their Pockets? That of our State is not counted money here. The old continental is dying by Yards not Inches. And if my Friends purchase Gold with their State money, They become Speculators, say all the Villains who have created the Necessity. Are you not aware of the Perdition that awaits my Family while the Paper System goes on. I take a Thousand Dollars here whether in old or 5 & 5/7 State I draw for 1000 or 25 State. I lose the Interest on the 25 as I have twice or thrice done on 250 and I pay above 1500 for patching my Coat, &c.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia May 8th 1781 I observed in Rivingtons paper a Letter from you Informing me that I might Draw upon you for two hundred pounds State money which Letter was Intercepted in the Mail taken at the Clove & Rivingtons Publication of it is the first Intelligence I have had respecting money for my Support for Six months past.(1) I am unwilling to say much respecting money or other affairs lest This might fall into the Enemys hands. Continental Money is received here by few persons when it is passed. A Decree of the Governor and Council has fixed it at 175 for one State Dollar & these State Dollars pass only at five for one of Silver & are Daily falling. New money from other States pass at forty for one of the old Continentals of Course four of Your Dollars will not purchase one of this State & five of them must be Employed To obtain a Silver Dollar which when purchased will not go so far in Supporting a person here as half a Dollar formerly would. The Sum you or rather Mr Rivington Informs me I may Draw for is 666 Dollars & two thirds. This upon the calculation I have before made would neat me 70 Silver Dollars & two thirds which would pay Eight Weeks Lodging for a Single person without Servant, Horse, Liquor, Wood, Candle or any other Article.  I have prevailed on a friend of mine to take a Bill on You as he is going Eastward & give me new money of this State for that of New Hampshire dollar for Dollar. This makes the 70 Silver Dollars Amount to 133 & this would Last as Long as half the Sum would in 74. I need make no Comments: I am willing to Submit to any MAY 8, 1781  Inconvenience to Serve my Country but an Embassador & a Beggar at the Same time would be disgraceful not to me but to my constituents.  I do not mention these things by way of Complaint it would be unjust & ungenerous to Censure our assembly or State who have Exerted themselves more than any other to Support the Common Cause but it is my duty to give Every Information necessary for them to know & perhaps My own feelings may be (Thought not falsely yet) too strongly painted in the representation.

What this Convulsion will end in, it is difficult to Surmise.

  Dr. Sr.(1) Phila. 10th May 1781  My engagement with Dr. Mortimer and exchanges of State paper for Continental before I left Virginia will prove a considerable loss to me as a few days before my arrival in this City a Resolution of the Executive Council respecting the Exchange had given a mortal stab to the old money (2) which now will not pass and if it does it will be at a depreciation of 200 for one as the State paper is 175 and between that and Specie there is five for one. What effect this step will have in Virginia requires no great degree of penetration to foresee. The Executive being speedily apprised of the measure will no doubt direct the Treasurer not to exchange the new for the old at one for forty untill the meeting of the Assembly that their determination May be had upon the matter and then it is to be presumed Virga. will avail herself of the depreciation and call in their quota at least at 175 for one-in short these strokes of Pensylvania and New Jersey will I think put an end in great measure to paper circulation unless it be a small quantity in aid of Specie. I beg you to inform me what steps are taking abt. the money and whether it will be for my advantage to send abt. 9000 dols. of the old money I have by me to Virginia or keep it here submiting to the loss. I need not inform you how much my Finances are deranged by this measure depending chiefly upon the old money and a little of the new Virga. one for forty for present supply.

I need not repeat again how much you ought all to be thankfull to me for giving you such frequent tokens of my affection and (long ones too) of my remembrance amidst the Hurry of Business & pleasure which this place affords-the latter of which with a good portion of the hours alotted to sleep I often Sacrifice on the Alter of Friendship-therefore do not condemn me when you do not receive letter for letter-flash for flash-or Dash for dash-but write on- MAY 11, 1781  upon my honor it is not in my Power to do more-let me hear often from you, how you do, what you do-and where you are-tis a great alleviation to my mind-and those who love me will not sure deny me so small a gratification. I am pleased beyond measure to find that Fanny has at last found the Use of her Perl, her letters are a Cordial to me-tell her not to lay it down but to write a few lines to me every day, and date them that I may be sure she thinks of me daily-she will find an opportunity to send them every now and then tell her not to mind coherency, or form, or manner, I know she does not want Matter, she has her Choice of Subjects-and as she has now got a Hero of her own-she may if she pleases write the history of his adventures or an Epic Poem, or a traji-comedy, or any thing she pleases-she may give me a detail of domestic occurrencies, family Chit Chat, tea Table Tittle Tattle, a treatise on agriculture, a dissertation, on milk & Butter, or on the art of spinning and weaving &c. &c. but above all let me know that she is well, and thereby add to my happiness.(1) I remark what you say with regard to the Boys and shall exert my utmost endeavors to obtain for them, a good Tutor. I wish you wd. put this wholly on me for shd you and my father and myself Engage each of us one, I fancy they will be over-tutord, I shall therefore take it for granted and act accordingly. You complain that I do not impart to you a full draught of Politics. Remember my Friend that it is not safe in these days of Speculation, and inspection of letters for a Man in my station to be diffuse on this head-the Arcana of the grand Manoeuvre ought to be but in a few hands-and not too liberally trusted to Paper; faelix quem faciunt aliena Pericula cautem.(2) The Enemy with their Tory coadjutors have robbd three of our Mails to the Northward since I came to this Place, and have publishd their Contents to the world, sophisticated to serve their purposes, I do not wish to give them a text to Comment upon. This is my apology for the omission you complain of-But I will in General tell you that you may expect the Pennsylvania line before this reaches you, a fine body of Veterans used to the Bayonette, with the Gallant Wayne at their head; and that every possible Exertion is using to Supply you plentifully with good arms; that Our Friend the King of Spain has actually supplyed us with a large Quantity of Cloathing about three thousand suits of which are actually arrived; that the 2d division of the French fleet together with the first will probably be in our bay by the time this reaches you-and that finally all things will go well-could the states be prevailed on to throw into the hands of Congress a few of those soverign powers, which are (in the hands of the individual States) totally inefficient to work the general weal-as the powers of no one state can be competent or coextensive to the wants of the whole. This is one of those obvious maxims in government that I fear the states will not be convinced of before they are on the Brink of Ruin,(3) to this cause alone is owing   the Embarrassd State of our finances-to this is owing the low conditions of our Navy, to this the weakness of our Army, and the Scantiness of its supplies-while Individuals are getting imaginary riches by preying on each other in an unjustifiable manner. The weakness of the whole exposes them to the fangs of an invader who may overturn the State, and bury them & their fortunes in the General wreck. Shall I tell you that the States have been so negligent in collecting their Taxes or in making the Tax gatherers pay them in, that not less than 100 million of arrears to speak without exaggeration is due to the Treasury of the U.S. while this sum remains in Circulation to be speculated on, speculated from, to depreciate, & when paid into the Treasury will not be worth an 100th part of what it wd have been. We have at length got a Superintendent of finance, Armed with mighty powers from whom great reformation is Expected (Mr Rt. Morris of this City.) I hope his abilities will rescue us from the abyss of Ruin in which we were plunging, but I own I am not among the Sanguine in this Expectation, unless the state give into the hands of Congress the Sole power of Issuing money-and of obliging the delinquents as well states as Individuals, to pay the Taxes; of imposing such Taxes as will constitute an efficient fund for borrowing of regulating Commerce, of enrolling seamen for the Navy &c. &c. I must now bid you adieu without Joking you on the Bayonette wound which you have so modestly hinted at in Fannys letter-a more artfull Soldier would have turnd such an honorable mark to good account. Your Martial atchievements have reachd this place and are registrd already in the book of fame.

There is nothing here so interesting as the present fluctuation of paper currency. The old continential is as low as 500 for one. Our State new emission is not known here as Pensylvania have not emitted their new emission of Continental but made an emission of their own State mony in stead of it. Connecticut did the like. So that I had the utmost difficulty to travel thro' Connecticut, York, Jersy & Pensylvania on paper mony. And being here I cant live one day on our State mony.

The tavern keepers on the road made a great merit of taking our new emission mony which I brought with me at that rate. I am drove to the necessity of drawing a bill on the state for hard mony which I shall do as soon as I can find a purchaser. General Sullivan tells me a purchaser can be got. I hope the court will approve my plan and answer the bill, otherwise I must return immediately home. My first bill will not exceed £100 hard mony in order that I may have the Sense of the Court how to proceed farther.(2) The paper I had out of the treasury except what I expended for fitting out & my expence on the road lies by me a dead letter. My Journy was long & tedious the roads being bad- rainy weather, & forrage very scarce I was obliged to put up one night without an ounce of hay, other nights the vilest fresh meadow hay was about as bad as none. However I made the Journy in 18 days.  It is said a French fleet is hourly expected in America as a vessel is arrived here that left France several days after them. And the Brittish are retreating at the Southward. I shall inform from time to time of whatever turns up that is interesting to the State or to the united States & beg the favour of a line from you per return of the Post.

  Sir, Philada May 14. 1781  The United States in Congress have this Day received Intelligence of so alarming a Nature that they think it their indispensible Duty immediately to forward it to you; and at the same Time to assure you that upon a serious Review of public Affairs they are convinced that unless the several States immediately & punctually comply with the Acts & Requisitions of Congress the worst of Consequences must ensue. I  Had the States paid due Attention to the Act of 18th March 1780 and complied with the Requisition of the 26th August, the Quarter Master would have been in Capacity to do his Duty and to have forwarded the Supplies which the States were called upon to furnish by the Act of 4th November. But as that has not been done the States must now not only furnish the Supplies but they must also forward them to the Places where they are wanted. For this purpose I enclose an earnest Recommendation passed this Day upon Receipt of the Intelligence above mentioned, and flatter myself that from the Necessity of the Case, your State will strain every Nerve & exert every Power to send forward the Supplies & prevent the fatal Events which must otherwise inevitably ensue.

  Sir Philadelphia May 14. 1781 The Circulation of the old Continental Bills is at an End in this City, and the same Effect will doubtless take Place through this and the adjoining States in a few Days. The Time limited for its Circulation by the late Law of the State expires the first of June. The Limitation is already expired in Maryland as affixed by their Law, it is probable that the late Publication of the President and Council of this State ascertaining the Rate of Exchange which is contained in the inclosed Papers (1) hath had some Effect in contracting the Period limited by Law for the Circulation of those Bills in this State. I am told that the old Continental Bills may be now obtained here for Specie at the Rate of five hundred Dollars of the former for one of Silver. As it is easy to suppose those Bills will circulate no considerable Time longer in any State, at least Northward of Pennsylvania, I cannot forbear to express my Wishes that the honorable General Assembly might immediately adopt such Mode as in their Wisdom shall appear most proper to call in the Quota of the old Bills assigned to Connecticut.  Information which I have received from different Ways, saith that the Assembly have had in Contemplation not to issue any of the new Bills emitted in Pursuance of the Resolve of the 18th March 1780, this may be a wise Measure if the Exigencies of Government & of the Continent will permit the Measure. At any Rate I would hope, not more than the four tenths assigned for the Use of the United States, should ever be issued: although I am of Opinion, had the Resolve of the 18th of March been carried into Execution without Loss of Time agreeable to the Intention of it, it might have proved the best Means & procured the greatest Relief respecting the Finances that the Nature of the Case could admit; yet by the great Delay of many of the States in their Compliance, on Paper only, and all of them in Fact, in carrying their Acts into Execution, the Plan is in a great  MAY 14, 1781  Measure frustrated the Depreciation of the old Money, by its Continuance in Circulation, contaminates every new Currency.  Mr Brown the Bearer will deliver your Excellency a Pamphlet published by Order of Congress, containing the Constitutions of Government in all the States, the Declaration of Independence, Treaty with France & Articles of Confederation. I have also forwarded by the same Conveyance a Number of the Journals of Congress for the Use of the State.  The Request to obtain the Invalids belonging, to Connecticut to be stationed & employed in that State, I fear will not be obtained. The Matter is yet undetermined.(2) The Petition of the Soldiers from Westmoreland is not granted.(3) If the Connecticut Line was full without them they might obtain their Discharge.

  Sir, Philadelphia May 14. 1781 My official Despatches to your Excellency which accompany this will shew the alarming Situation of the Army and Posts to the Northward on Account of Provisions. I have long since been convinced that the present Method of Supplying the Army with Provisions by requisitions on the several States, a Method dictated MAY 14, 1781  merely by Necessity is & will be attended with great Difficulties & Embarrassments, yet Congress have no other Means in their Power at present to obtain the necessary Supplies, and must depend upon the States to furnish them agreeable to their Requisitions as the only Means to keep the Army together.  Congress in the mean Time are endeavoring to devise other Means if possible more eligible to feed the Army, to be put in Practice as soon as possible, but without Money nothing can be done. The Delegates from Connecticutt who lately left Congress will be able to represent the distressing Situation of public Affairs from the State of our Finances, yet at the same Time from all Accounts we can collect there are plentiful Resources in the Country.

  Noon 14th of May 1781 By a Letter of the 1st, this Moment recd.,(1) I find that my amiable & respected Friend is under the mistake of supposing the Enemy in Possession of one of her former which has reached me, and that I have neglected to answer some others. She will know better before this reaches her. The Enemy have the one which attended Mr. Cranche's:(2) So that I have no Knowledge of the Mode He or She particularly pointed out for forwarding the Goods in my Possession.  I have had the Satisfaction of knowing that Mr. Hugh Hughes has well guarded, by boxing, what I committed to Doctr.

I was not able to send by Mr. Brown your large Box or the China. He goes greatly loaded from hence, but as he drops part of his Charge at Head Quarters, he can conveniently take what I have mentioned, at Fishkill, if it has not yet been sent on by the Kindness of Mr. Hughes.(3) The Enemy have published one Letter from Mr.  MAY 14, 1781  Adams, dated in Decr.(4) and they say they have intercepted a Pacquet from him & Doctr. Franklin; but I do not think they say truly. I imagine they have got only that general Letter of News not ordered to be sunk. We have had nothing from Holland a long Time, except something which Mr. Carmichael transmitted in the handwriting of a known Correspondent at the Hague, (5) and which you must have seen republished, I imagine, in your own Gazettes.

But I have been very stoical, For it would have been a Shame to groan at what happened, while I reflected that neither Back nor Limb was broken, nor any Joint absolutely dislocated. Portia will however do me the Justice to think that neither Pain or afffliction shall make me neglect Endeavors to render her Service in finishing the little Business of sending on her Invoice or rather her Goods. I have written for the Invoices agreable to her Hints.  I imagine that some of the articles supposed missing are in the Band Box, and that Mr. Wibert may find some Things within his Package of Cloth, which was in so good order as not to need opening.

Philips, after great destruction of Tobacco, Ware houses &c, advanced to Manchester on the South bank of James's river opposite to Richmond and summoned the Marquis and required him to be answerable for some vessels Iying in the north side of the river, about the same time Arnold with 600 troops passed the river a little below who being furiously attacked by about 30 of Nelsons horse, Arnold retreated and recrossed the river with the utmost precipitation and disorder. Genl. Phillips then retreated d[own river?] and embarked his troops. I believe on the 5[th the] enemy relanded on the south side of James [River and by?] the 8th were beyond Petersb[urgh...] (2) to join Lord Cornwal[lis...] (2) Wilmington and Halliftax ...].(2)  On the 26th of last month Genl.

Greene on his return from that place-time only can discover the enemys disign or the event of the var[ied] and complicated opperations to the southward.

The Executive of this State gives no reason to expect any farther supply until the Assembly meets-on the 24th of this month.

  Dear Sir,(1) Phila. May 15th. 1781 The late Scale of Depreciation as laid down by the Presidt. & Council of this State has thrown every thing into Confusion; no Money except hard will pass in this City but at the most ruinous rate. Our Northern Army is Starving, & Congress have it not in their power to remove one hundred barrels of Flour.  I received from the Treasurer of our State Three hundred & forty pounds of the New Emission in Consequence of an Order from the Gov. & Council, (2) part of this Money I exchanged for Continental being told it was Money that was prefered in Phila. to any other paper. On my way up I met Numbers of Speculators from Phila with quantities of Continental to pass it off in our State. How they succeeded I know not, but that, nor any other paper will now pass in this City but at the most Destructive rate. I have therefore returned the Continental To Mr Stone in hopes the Assembly will give directions to the Treasurer to receive this Money in exchange for Bills of the New Emission. I should also have returned the New Bills (for I cannot pass them here) but they are too bulky. What the Maryland Dilegates will do for want of Money I do not know, there is but one Mode by which they can be supplyed ie, to order a quantity of Superfine flour to be Manufactured at the Head of the Bay, Superfine flour will command hard Money. Should this plan be adopted by the assembly or the Governor & Council Mr. Joseph Gilpin will execute it with dispatch. Coll. Hollingsworth has too MAY 15, 1781  much upon his hands to pay proper attention to this business, besides he might not be in the way when this order might arrive at the head of Elk. Had I hard Money or could I procure it on my own Credit I should not hesitate to pledge myself. If no Mode of supply can be fallen upon I must soon return to Maryland.  Our affairs are in a most wretched situation. Congress is at its wits End, everything at a stand and unless the French fleet & Army arrive very soon we shall in all probability be in the most deplorable situation.  The Navigation of the Mississippi has prevented us from procuring Supplies from Spain, Congress have relaxed & made this point in the Ultimatum Negotiable, but too late for any Supplies for this Campaign. The Emperor has offered his Mediation. I fear that there is too good an Understanding between the Courts of Vienna & London.  We have received no late advices from Europe.

The moment for successfull operations agt. our Enemies was certainly immediately after the disaster in Gardners Bay when had it been embraced the Post at Portsmouth and the Troops' under Arnold as well as the British Ships then in Virginia must have fallen an easy conquest to our united efforts for which purpose the State was I believe in readiness. Abortive as the project has proven we yet hope for the best and that still it may be in the Power of our Ally to give us effectual aid in Chesapeake and believe me at no time was it more necessary than at present when all the lower Country of our State from its great MAY 16, 1781  navigable waters are exposed to the ravage and rapine not only of British Ships of War but of the Vessells employed by the Board of Refugee Commissioners in New York. To you it is unnecessary to describe the distress of the Inhabitants upon the Navigable Waters of Virginia. Your Knowledge of the Country enables you sufficiently to judge of it exclusive of such informations as I doubt not you receive from that quarter. Had we a sufficient stock of Arms distressing as it is to our Militia to be so generally out on Duty as it must be to them at this Season of the year, I think they wod. do much in opposition to the Enemy supported even by no considerable Body of Regulars but wanting Arms, their Negroes flying from them and their prospects of making little or nothing from their Estates to support their Families and bear the burdens of the War may shake their fidelity and attachment to the cause so far as to slacken their exertions if some succor is not afforded them by Water to restrain the Ravage of these plunderers. I mention these things as facts falling under my own observation before I left the State that if they have not been more particularly communicated by others you might have some intimation of them. The late movements of Cornwallis and Philips indicate a junction of their Armies on the Roanoke from whence they may direct their operations North or South as they shall see best without the fear of successfull opposition, or may, it wod. seem, cut of[f] all communication between Virga. and the other Southern States and reduce Genl. Greene to the greatest extremity. From these dangers that at present threaten us a Naval Force sent to the Chesapeake wod. at once relieve us and admit Virga. to afford that succor to the other southern States they so much need.

  Dear Sir Philadelphia May 19. 1781 A few Days ago I was favoured with yours of the 27th of April by your Brother (1) and do truly feel myself sensibly obliged by your Attention to my Affairs. Your Brother will soon I expect be able to discharge Mr Turbervilles Account only the Interest Bills & indeed all Bills on Europe here Sell very low. They do not bring at present above 5/ this Money a Dollar. I beg you would make my Compliments to Mr Turberville & thank him for his ready compliance with my Desire-The rather this is necessary because from some thing  MAY 19, 1781  your Brother said I suppose what I wrote about my having sent twice on purpose to Maryland & Virginia to collect the Arrears due to me been applied to him but his Sum was So Small compared with the others that I never Sent it before. I shall have great Reliance on what you have written respecting Col. Lees Account. One Mr Ker in Dumfries has Directions to settle it. I shall be now fully satisfied if I can receive the original Sum with Interest and paid in hard Money for though as I wrote before Money in the Time of these Expenditures was much more valuable than Now & would have gone nearly twice as far in Stocking as I am or clothing a Family yet Such is the Call I hear for money at present that I will be happy in receiving it-if in real Money. What adds to my present Difficulties is that my eldest Son John (2) has lately been taken by the English at Statia where he was a Surgeon to a Letter of Marque. By a Letter from a Merchant there & the Captain who brought it I am informed that my Son is very hardly treated on Acct of his Relation to me and Some bold and spirited thing that he said to Admiral Rodney when reproached with that Relation. He was sent to England on the 10th of March & When some Gentleman of the Island sent him some Hams, Cheese, Pork & Wine as Sea Stores & Refreshments the Capt. Ordered them to be thrown overboard. This unhappy Situation which has deeply affected his Mother & my self requires particularly Some Attention to him in point of Credit-which nothing but hard money will procure now in this Place.  You must have heard before now of the dreadful Blow which Paper Money of all Kinds has lately received. It is lamentable to think how our Operations are hindered, our Army distressed and our Friends missed by our trusting to Paper Money. Just now My son in law (3) has met with a Stroke of that kind. When he left Virginia he sold his Furniture on Credit has been paid in Paper and his Brother bringing two Weeks ago several thousand Pounds continental Money it perished in his hand in one Week & would not now enable him to travel 50 Miles.  A Committee of Congress of whom I am one have been making a last Effort for putting an End to the Use of Paper but though some of the parts of our System have been adopted I am affraid it will be finally defeated by those still hankering after the partial use of that Deceiver. It is probable you will have the News upon this and other Subjects Sent you fully by your Brother. Some Dispatches came to the Minister of France to Day of which we shall know the Contents on Monday-if there be any thing particularly interesting that can be communicated I shall either write it to You by the Post or tell him that he may write it.  We have got one New Delegate from N.H.(4) but I cannot as yet tell much about his Principles or probable Conduct. Mr. Duane is gone & New York is not represented neither is Connecticut, Rhode Island nor Delaware a Piece of Neglect wholly inexcusable at this Time.  The President of Congress asked Leave lately to go home and a Day was fixed for the Choice of another. The Ballots being taken upon that Day no one had more than two Votes so that we requested the President to continue & it was postponed sine die and I think it probable he will continue till the Fall.(5) I believe if your Colleague Mr Jones would have agreed to serve he would have been chosen. If a New Attempt is made I think either he or Mr Jenifer of Maryland will be the Man. We are all at present very anxious about the Situation of your State & impatiently looking for a greater sea force.  I am D Sir your &c, JW  ""

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia May 20th. 1781 The various accounts we frequently have here, & the want of information from you, puzzles us exceedingly; a thousand conjectures are formed, but your true situation we can learn nothing of. A Man arrived here yesterday one Jennette, who says he left you before Camden on the 27 Ulto. & that it was expected that place would surrender to you in the course of four or five days. This will serve you as a specimen of the reports I have above alluded to. You may readily suppose our anxiety is not small, when we receive such intelligence, to hear something from the fountain head. We so frequently receive similar intelligence which is soon again contradicted, that we are grown callous, & believe nothing, but what we get officially. I hope we shall soon hear from you, & be relieved from this cruel state of doubt & uncertainty; and I flatter myself when it does arrive, it will be pleasing; tho' I must confess, we have little reason to expect st.  Congress have at last put the means in Genl. Waynes hands to march, (1) & I have no reason to doubt, but what he is this day on his march. Had this been done six weeks ago, (which might as well have been then done, as three days ago) he would 'ere this have been with you, & in all probability prevented the present movements of the enemy. But whilst we have men at the head of our affairs, who are uniformly opposed to the least deviation from the plain John trot mode of doing business, whose souls are confined within the compass of a nut shell, & who like Dean Swifts' Peter, Jack, & Martin, tremble at the very Idea of doing any thing that is not strictly injoined them by their fathers Will tho' the salvation of the country depended on it.(2) I say whilst we have such Quidnunc politicians to manage our affairs, we must expect nothing vigorous, or decisive, being done. However they have at length in one instance blundered across the Rubicon (but I believe most of them did it with their eyes shut, as Children do, when they walk in the dark, for fear of meeting the Devil in their way.) I mean the vote that was passed, giving powers to Genl. Wayne, to press provisions on his march, whenever he wanted them. Perhaps you may laugh at my making such a fuss about this affair, as your army is fed by scarcely any other means. But remember there is no such power literally given to Congress by Confederation and to act up to the spirit of it, is a doctrine supposed to be big with many evils, therefore reprobated. I conceive it to be a great point gained, to drive them from this ground; it looks like conceeding the point, & that necessity will oblige them, to interpret the powers given by the Confederation in their utmost extent, & in my opinion, ought upon some occasions, to be strained to answer the great purposes of war. But I apprehend, when these Doughty heroes, have opened their eyes, & looked back, MAY 20, 1781  on the tremendous gulph they have passed, they will be astonished at their own temerity; & the next they come to, they will make a halt, to examine their tender consciences, whether, after having escaped so great a danger with impunity, it would be prudent to tempt their fate again; & most probably, the result will be, that they are sure the Devil must fly away with them, should they sin a second time, & of course they will apostatize. In which case, it will be an Herculian labour to bring them back to the charge.  The backwardness of the States, in executing the requisitions of Congress, is intolerable, & when they do, it is in such a loose, discordant manner, that their small exertions produce little good, from whence principally arises our embarrassments. It therefore appears to me absolutely necessary, & for the true interest of the union, that the several states, should give to Congress Dictatorial powers during the war, & instruct their Delegates, to take the most vigorous measures for prosecuting the war. This power is certainly more safely lodged in the hands of such a body as Congress, than any other. The only objection I have to it, is, that I am afraid, they will want spirit to do their duty, but this may be remedied by spirited instructions. Something like this must soon be done, or as I am clearly convinced our affairs will grow from bad to worse, which must end in our utter ruin. Those states that are in perfect tranquillity, & feel nothing of the effects of the war, will I know, be averse to such a measure, therefore I despair of it's being done, but they will too late find, when the house falls, they will inevitably be crushed in its ruins. We must either stand or fall together. However they may amuse themselves with the Idea of sacrificing some for the good of the whole, the hypothesis will prove fallacious, divida et empera, is an axiom that will prove as certain, as it is old.

  Dear Sir Philadelphia May 21. 1781 Arbuthnots Squadron went from Chesepeak to New York about 3 weeks ago-and on Monday evening last sailed out with some Transports said to have 2000 troops on board. On Friday evening last they were seen near the Capes of Delaware. Their destination is not known. The objects to induce them up this river are nearly as MAY 21, 1781  great as ever, but probably they may go the southward. I expect that the sufferings of the southern States are already so great, that they must sink, unless soon supported.  I suppose that Genl. Wayne has not marched before this time from York Town. The second Division has not arived, tho it is said they sailed from Brest on the 20th March. I fear they will touch at the West Indias & delay there some time, nor has the clothing & Stores arived. It is said they were to sail from L'Orient the 27 March. No word of the Shelala, on board of which was Colo. Palfrey, ariving in Europe. It is supposed she foundered at Sea, Colo. Laurens arived safe in France, but no letters from him nor Doctr. Franklin. By letters from Spain dated 22 Feby & the Hague dated we are informed that the Dutch were making great preparations to avenge themselves on the enemy. That the Northern powers would aid the Dutch. That the King of Prussia & the Emperor had a watchful eye on each other. That our affairs in Spain wear a more flattering aspect than formerly, only one thing stood in the way of something conclusive. Mr. Cumberland was about to leave Madrid. About 2000 Suits of cloaths has arived at Boston from Mr. Jay. The seige of Giberalter continued. Nothing has transpired whereby we can say, what operations Count D Estaing will be engaged in this campaign. It is expected he will be in the West Indias. A Frigate has arived with an Admiral on board to succeed M. Ternay.  The entire use of paper money is nearly at an end. The old is nearly dead-and the new paper here from 6 to 10 for one of specie. I expect all our paper has fallen or will fall entirely in the Southern States-then we shall have to barter. Specie we have none. We have heard of Genl. Greene's disappointment before Camden on the 25th ulto.(1) It is reported that Cornwallis has passed Hallifax on his way to join Phillips.  The comr-in-chief is much embarrassed for want of provisions.  May 22d. Count de Rochambeaus son has returned with dispatches-none appears yet from Docr. Franklin nor Colo. Laurens. Some circumstances induce me to be of opinion that the second division will stay some time in the W. Indias. I wish I may be mistaken.  I hope that Mr. Hill is before this time on his way up, to relieve me. We feel infinite pain for our distressed country. We have got the board of war engaged to repair 2000 muskets & send them forward to our State. You know that with our utmost efforts, this measure may fail.  I am very sincerely, My dear Sir, Your most obt. Humble Servt. Wm. Sharpe  MAY 22, 1781  P.S.

As to the business of the States I can with pleasure inform you that congress are coming into a new plan of raising mony & a more frugal plan of spending it.(1) The general voice seems to be to emit no more paper, to call in what is emitted as fast as it can conveniently be done, to loan, to tax in hard mony, to furnish the army with provision, cloathing, stores &ca. by contract &ca &ca. I dont mention these things as done, but as in contemplation. Continental debts to be liquidated in hard mony & put upon interest if agreable to the creditor. As to our southern army they have a hard time on't, but they behave well. A letter from Genl. Green of the 27th Apr. mentions an engagement of the 25th wherein he took above 50 prisoners altho it was a kind of drawn battle, this was near Camden.

I recd. a Letter from Mr. Carmichael two days ago dated March 11th with a Plan the Success of which he could not foresee. I had copied the Plan for Genl. Ward's Use.

I will bound myself by saying that the middle & eastern States must comply fully & almost immediately with all, if not more than all the Requisitions of Congress already made upon them, or sudden Destruction will probably come upon the whole Confederacy, or at least a general great Disgrace will come upon us.  I promise myself that Genl. Washington's Letter to Col. Harrison published by Rivington will make the Enemy heedless and rash. But what Benefit can their foolish Conduct afford us if we allow ourselves to remain so incapable as we are at present of reaping in such a Field.  Is Brother Gerry sick?

We were very Solicitous to put an end to the Controversey in a manner, consistent with both your Honors, without cause of triumph to the Enemy, or the loss of either of your Services to the Public.  I therefore declared I was authorized to Say, that Mr Burke was not the person intended to be described by you in your Letter to MAY 22, 1781  Congress of the 27th Sepr 1771 [1777]. Mr Shiell on his part declared, that Mr Burke's motive in writing the Letters to you on the Subject of the action at Brandywine was purely to declare the reasons which governed his conduct in Congress in discussing the misfortune of that Battle, that Mr Burke had no intention of personal insult to you, and that Since you have been in Congress He has had reason to alter his opinion of you. And Mr Shiell then proposed we should have another meeting to Commit this to writing and exchange Copies of it, and bring you and Mr Burke together at His House.

It must have been a most mortifying circumstance to you to have such a victory snatched out of your hands by the blunder of a single man. It was not only the immediate advantages resulting to us, that we are to look to, but the eclat that would have been given to our arms abroad, this would have been of still more importance. However, we must look for better fortune another time. I dare not flatter myself so far as to say, I shall yet hope to hear of the reduction of Camden; but I will rest satisfyed with this assurance, that every thing that can be will be done for the best.(2)  Congress this day received a very affectionate and friendly letter from the King of France.(3) He gives us every assurance of the most  MAY 22, 1781  substantial aid, as far as his abilities, and the exigencies of affairs in Europe will admit of. He speaks in the most tender and feeling manner on the distressed situation of our affairs, & says he will risque embarrassing his own affairs, in order to afford us some relief, at the same time calls on us in the most polite, yet pathetic terms to make every exertion in our power to Co-operate with him in his endeavours for our peace & happiness. He expresses the highest regard for these states in general and for each state in particular. In short, true magnanimity, firmness, & affection run through the whole of it.

In Consequence of this Resolve the Board of War have ordered them, the Commissioned Officers to East Windsor in Connecticut, the non commissioned Officers and Privates to Rutland in Massachusetts.

It may not be improper to inform your Excellency, that in Consequence of this Resolve, the General in a very decent Letter to Congress informed them that he could not be useful in the Field or think of going into Service in his present Circumstances.

  My dear Sir,(1) Phila. May 28th. 1781 I thank you for your favor of the 25th. The Enemys Cruizers being in our Bay & Rivers I conceived would prevent the General assemblys meeting so soon as the Exigency of our affairs required. It is now Neck or nothing. Every exertion must be used this Campaign to prevent the Southern States being overrun. Every dispersion of the Enemy has its effect, & altho the prize be small yet it encourages interprize.  Yesterday & to day arrived from the Havanah Eight Sail of Vessels with Hard Money. The Merchants I am told pay very little regard to the embargo Law, indeed the State has not Money to purchase the third of any Vessels Cargo even were it to be offered to the President & Council.  The Pennsylvania Line I believe is now on their March. General Wayne was obliged to Order a Platoon to fire on part of the right Wing who refused to March four of the Mutineers were killed one man it is said had 23 Balls through him.  Your Delegates are without Money or Credit. What are they to do, none but hard will pass at this place unless it be on the most ruinous terms. There is but one way that I know of by which they may be supplied, & that is by ordering some wheat, at the Head of the Bay to be Ground up into Superfine Flour. Mr. Joseph Gilpin promissed me on my way up to execute a Commission of this sort, were he to be empowered by the assembly or The Governor & Council.(2) Col. Hollingsworth has too much on his hands to give proper attention to this business.  There never has been a time when Men of abilities were more necessary in Congress than at present, therefore I wish that proper attention may be paid to the Delegates Letter by this Post to the General Assembly.(3) We are not at liberty to disclose particulars, but the sooner an addition is made to the Delegation the better as delay cannot be admitted. Altho at every Post want prevails, yet I flatter myself that our affairs will soon look up & that supplies will soon be had.  MAY 28, 1781  I wish you and your little Woman health and happiness and am very truly, My dear friend, Your affectionate Servt,  Dan of St Thos Jenifer [P.S.] Mr. Cumberland was about leaving Madrid the 9th of Mar. I think his stay there was rather too long for the United States. Mr Carroll is not very well.  ""

  May 28, 1781. To the PRINTER of the FREEMAN's JOURNAL.  I have observed, in the first paper which you emitted,} a solemn declaration that you would conceal the name of the author of any piece which might be handed you for publication, except in cases of torture or the obligation of civil law; and all this under the specious pretence that it was the liberty of the press. It was pretty evident at first view, that you, sir, had intended, or, at least, was calculated to be a vehicle for communicating to the world pieces from tories and British emissaries; pieces scurrilous and ludicrous; pieces containing misrepresentations and falshoods against public bodies, public measures, and individuals. I believe, sir, I have not been mistaken.  Among many other ill-natured things, to say no worse of them, I have observed a very illiberal attack on the conduct of Mr. Duane during the present contest, by a certain Lucilius or Plain Truth of your acquaintance.(2)  To answer all the little scurrility that is contained in those pieces, is far beneath the man of candour or a liberal pen. You or Mr. Plain Truth, as he is very improperly called, hath represented Mr. Duane as a tory, a British emissary, duplicity in his conduct, \""a secret enemy, endeavouring to confound, embarrass, protract, and defeat the best concerted plans and measures for maintaining the independency of America.\"" Now, Sir, as you are the proper vehicle, please to ask Mr. Plain Truth, alias Falshood, the following plain questions, viz. Did not Mr. Duane propose, and, in conjunction with the council of safety, execute some of the boldest measures against tories and traitors in the state of New-York, in the latter end of 1776, when our affairs were a gloomy aspect? Is not the legislature of the state of New-York composed of whigs and men of sense? If Mr. Duane is a tory, &c. would not the legislature of New-York have discovered it, and left him out of their delegation? Is not Mr. Duane at the head of MAY 28, 1781  their delegation? If they knew or even suspected Mr. Duane to be a tory, &c. would they suffer him, nay would they not prevent him from filling places of the highest trust, and blot his name out of the register of American patriots? Are the congress of the united states tories, or secret enemies, or British emissaries? If they are not, could Mr. Duane or any other member be so long in their councils, where there are so many watchful eyes, without being detected, or even suspected? Does not the journals give unequivocal evidence of the confidence which congress have in his ability and fidelity, when his ability and fidelity,(3) when his name is so repeatedly found in committees, to whom were committed the most important papers and subjects? If you and Plain Truth's unhallowed eyes had access to the files in the secretary's office, you might see hundreds of the reports of committee's drawn with his own hand, which would convince every candid mind, not only of his abilities, but also his firmness and assiduity in business, all combined in leading to the great object, namely the happiness and independence of these united states? Can any member of congress be found, who having been a considerable length of time engaged in business with Mr. Duane will say, that he has endeavored to confound, embarrass, protract or defeat the best concerted plans, or even suspected he was a tory, a secret enemy, an emissary, &c.?  Can any man be a real friend to his country, who will wantonly, without provocation or the colour of foundation, sport with the character of men in public stations, who are using the utmost stretch of their abilities, spending their fortunes, and sacrificing their domestic ease and happiness in supporting the rights of this devoted country, and who are using their utmost efforts to bring the contest to a happy and glorious issue? Does not such conduct weaken the hands of our rulers, and strengthen those of the enemy?  CANDOR.(4) MS not found; reprinted from The Freeman's Journal; or, the North-American Intelligencer, May 30, 1781.  1 That is, the April 25, 1781, inaugural issue of Bailey's Freeman's Journal  2 James Duane had been the object of three scurillous attacks published in the May 9, 16, and 23 issues of The Freeman's Journal over the pseudonyms \""Plain Truth\"" and \""Lucilius,\"" in the course of which he had been labelled \""a cunning, artful traitor,\"" in league with \""his chosen associates Joseph] Galloway, [Andrew] Allen, [Robert] Alexander, [Silas] Deane, [and Benedict] Arnold.\"" Much was also made of the coincidence that Duane had returned to New York from Philadelphia the same day the first attack had been printed (\""Flight is a confession of guilt, as well as cowardice\""), and he was even charged with positioning himself to profit from the war with Britain regardless of the outcome-\""If we succeed in our independence, [he] will be a great and wealthy member of these States; should we fail the British funds must be exhausted to yield him an adequate reward.\""  These charges, which Duane formally defended himself against before the New York legislature in late June, and which provided the focus of an intermittent debate between Duane's detractors and supporters in the Journal's pages from May 9 to   August 22, have been discussed in Edward P. Alexander, A Revolutionary Conservative: James Duane of New York (New York: Columbia University Press, 1938), pp. 147-51. See also these Letters, 3:296-97, 302, Duane to Abraham Brasher, August 24; and Ezra L'Hommedieu to George Clinton, September 26, 1781. Thus in Bailey's text.  4 Candor's identity has not been discovered. \""Plain Truth,\"" who responded to Candor's defense of Duane in the June 6 issue of The Freeman's Journal, referred to him as a \""Member of Congress,\"" a conclusion strongly suggested by the essay's content.

  My dear General Phila May 28. 1781 I wrote you on the 22d instant (1) by express going to the Marquis De la Fayette. In full confidence that Docr. Fassaux will hand you this, I will venture a few hints which are necessary for you to know, and may perhaps be communicated more at large by the commander in Chief or some other person.  We have lately recieved dispatches from France.(2) The second division is not to be sent, but an augmentation so as to give the new Admiral de Barrass the superiority; and a powerful diversion is intended in the West Indias. This change took place in consequence of the Dutch war which must be cherrished by France. A subsidy of six millions of Livres is given, part will come in cloathing &c and part to be a fund under the direction of the Comr-in-Chief. I entertain a hope that Mr. Morris is in the way to restore public credit. G. W. has had a conferrence with compte R[ochambeau] on military operations. The enemy have forbid any communications with New York by Flag or otherwise-many conjecture that an evacuation is intended, I am not yet brot. into that opinion.  The Empress of R[ussia] and the Emperor have offered their mediation between all the beligerent powers. It hath been accepted by the Court of L ____n with an apparent degree of eagerness. France waits the consent of their ally before a negociation can begin, conferrences will in all probability open within a few months.(3) In the meantime Military operations will be carried on with the greatest vigor against us. In order to make an advantageous peace we ought to be in condition to prosecute the war. Important events are suspended in which the southern States are infinitely interested. Congress will doubtless use their utmost address to Stimulate the States to suitable exertions.  May you my dear Sir and your little army be preserved to enjoy the fruits of your labor and anxiety in a permanent and an honorable peace.

  My dear General Philadelphia May 28th 1781 Though the Distresses of our Army, the Success of the Enemy in the Southern States; The certainty of the Second Division not coming to America; and the Disposition of the Soverigns of Russia, and Germany, to dictate a Peace; when the uti possidetes if admitted would operate to deprive us of very important parts of the united States: Yet I cannot forbear congratulating your Excellency on the general Complextion of our affaires which in my Opinion wear a more promising Aspect Than they have done for many years.  The Reinforcement from France though far short of what was intended, will (I trust) Enable us to undertake offensive operations by Land & Sea. The Generous Donation of his most Christian Majesty with the Measures adopted by Congress & by our Financier will Enable us to pay and Supply our Army. The Cloathing Arrived & now on its passage will Enable us to Cloathe our Army. The Measures adopted by the French Court will furnish us with the necessary Munitions of War. The Exertions of Mr R. Morris will in a few Days give you a permanent Supply of provisions Independant of The Supplies Expected from the States. The Late important discoveries made by Congress have at Length convinced them that Honesty is the best policy; This will restore our Lost credit. The prospects of a peace being Dictated to us by an Armed neutrality will rouse Congress and the States to Exertions which may put us on a footing to negotiate on Terms of Equality. The Scrupulous adherence of his Christian Majesty to the Terms of the Alliance, The favorable Disposition of the Spanish Court; and the interest which the powers of Europe have discovered in our becoming an Independant Nation promise us Every thing in a Negociation which our Exertions & their political Interest may Dictate. But amidst all those flattering prospects we are now called upon to make our Last desperate Struggle to pave the way to that peace and Independance for which we have so long contended. Congress do and I am convinced the States will feel the Necessity to Exert Every Nerve at this critical moment and I do not Entertain a Doubt of the Success. The rule of promotions has with much difficulty passed;(1) which though not in Every respect agreable to my mind is much better  MAY 29, 1781  Than any thing yet adopted. The Committee fell in with Your Excellencys reasoning but the obstinacy of ignorant members in Some degree Mutilated the plan. The Arrangement of the Artillery and Cavalry was rejected because it was Supposed to militate against the Confederation; other parts were rejected for different reasons and Some for no reason at all but I flatter myself that as it now Stands it will answer our views in Some Degree. I should be more particular with your Excellency upon European Intellig[ence] but your Late conference at Weathersfie[ld] Must have Superseaded the Necessity.

  Dear Sir Philada. May 29th. 1781 The two circumstances relating to the proposed duty on trade mentioned in your favor of the 1st instant (1) were subjects of discussion when the measure was on the anvil.(2) It was evident that the disposition of the States to invest Congress with such a power wd. be influenced by the length of the term assigned for the exercise of it. It was equally evident that no provision would satisfy the present creditors of the U. States or obtain future loans that was not commensurate to all the public engagements. In order to reconcile these points the duration of the impost was limited, but limited in so indefinite a manner as not to defeat the object of it. Should the increase of trade render the duty more productive than was estimated it must the sooner extinguish the public debts & cease. The application of Congress for such a power supposes indeed a confidence in them on the part of the States, greater perhaps than many think consistent with republican jealousy, but if the States will not enable their representatives to fulfill their engagements, it is not to be expected that individuals either in Europe & America will confide in them. The 2d objection you mention was also a subject of much discussion in Congress. On one side it was contended that the powers incident to the collection of a duty on trade were in their nature so municipal, and in their operation so irritative that it was improbable that the States could be prevailed on to part with them, and that consequently it would be most prudent to ask from the States nothing more than the duty itself, to be collected by State officers & paid to a Continental Receiver, and not the right of levying & collecting it by officers of Congress. On the opposite side it was urged that as Congress would be held responsible for the public debts it was necessary & would be expected, that the fund granted for discharging them should be exclusively & independently in their hands, that if the Collectors were under the controul of the States the urgency of their wants would be constantly diverting the revinue from its proper destination, that if the States were willing to give up MAY 29, 1781  the thing itself it was not likely they would cavil at any form that wd. be most effectual, that the form proposed might be reconciled with their internal jurisdictions by annexing to the Office of Collector all the powers incident thereto, & leaving to Congress the right of appointing the Officer. How far it may be best to appoint the established naval officers, I am not prepared to say, but should that be found to be the case, they will exercise their new functions, not as naval officers of the State, but as invested with a separate commission by Congress, in such manner that in the former respect, they are wholly exempt from the jurisdiction of Congress, & in the latter from that of the State. Such a junction of powers, derived from different sources, in the same person certainly has its inconveniences, but there will be many instances of it in our complex Government. I have met with so many interruptions this morning that I fear I may have not done justice to the subject in my explanation of it. Another consequence is that I must be very brief on [the] head of intelligence to make sure of the post.  A report of an intended evacuation of N. Y. has again sprung up. The rumor of Clintons being in the Bay corresponds so well in point of time with the last embarkation that I fear you lent too incredulous a ear to it. Genl Wayne has certainly moved at last after bringing the competi[t]ion b[etween] discipline & the mutinous spirit of the troo[ps to an] issue. Fortunately the former gained a complete triumph. If Virga. can maintain her opposition a little time longer, I flatter myself the direction of our general force will be more favorable for her than it has been. If the war centers in the S. Department on the part of the Enemy, it certainly must on our part. A number of arrivals have taken place within a few days from the Havannah. It is sd. near 200,000 Dollars make a part of their Cargo. The enormous price of flour produces this ballance in our favor. What a prodigious sum we are losing from the delay of the States to authorise the collection of the 5 Per Ct. on Trade, the plan not permitting it in one State till all shall have Concurred in it. It appears probable that Pensacola is by this time in the hands of the Spaniards. Adieu. J Madison Jr.  ""

  Dear Sir Philadelphia May 29th 1781 If Ever a People were called upon for vigorous Exertions, by the pressing Situation of their affairs & Entreated to make their Last Struggle against an implacable Enemy, The Americans at this moment are in that Situation: we are now upon our last Campaign; if vigorous Exertions render it Successful we Shall Sit Down, Quietly in the Enjoyment of that Independance for which we have so Long contended but if Languid Efforts render our attempts unsuccessful we are ruined past relief.  The Emperour of Germany & Empress of Russia have offered their mediation to the Beligerent powers; The Acceptance is inevitable. France and Spain have given Answers which will work a delay but can by no means preclude a Compliance with Their demand. To have a peace dictated to us when our Army is in the most feeble Situation, in the greatest want of provisions through the want of Exertions in the States: when the Enemy are possessed of two States and are carrying their Conquests into others; when prescribing the uti possidetis as a Basis of Accommodation would forever ruin the united States would be a misfortune far beyond what the Calamities of war could possibly produce. To avert the danger and to obtain a Peace upon honorable Terms Every Exertion must be used to push with vigor This Campaign (which will probably be our Last). The King of France to Enable us to Act with vigor has made us a Donation of Six Million of Livers. This will put our Finances on a respectable footing. The Exertions of Mr Robert Morris our financier with the plans pursuing by Congress will render them Still more so. Arms, Ammunition and Cloathing are provided by the French Monarch which will Soon be here. The King of Spain is also Supplying with Cloathing & will furnish Some money.

I thought about this time to be making preparations for leaving this place, but none of my colleagues appearing to relieve me, several States being unrepresented in Congress, and affairs of the first magnitude being now on the tapis, I thought it inconsistent with my honor to leave the State unrepresented at so interesting a period. Notwithstanding my anxious impatience to return to my family, I have determined to stay till I am relieved, or at least till the States are more fully represented in Congress. I don't doubt but you and my sister will offer such reasons to Mrs. Johnston as will reconcile her to this measure. I hope she will keep up her spirits and if I should not return before the sickly season, I wish you would prevail on her to take the children down to the sea-side, if it can be done with safety; but as I have hopes of returning before that time, it will be unnecessary to say any thing on the subject till the season approaches. The uncertainty of a letter's getting safe to you, lays me under great restraints. I can only mention in general that the King of France has given us under his own hand very lately, the most unequivocal assurances of his friendship and support, and is at this time exerting his interest and influence at the different courts in Europe to bring our affairs to a happy and speedy conclusion; and I have in my own mind the most perfect confidence in these assurances. We shall suffer much in this campaign; it will be very bloody, but I  MAY 30, 1781  hope it will be the last. I may be disappointed, but was I at liberty to commit my reasons to writing, you would not hesitate to subscribe to my opinion. Our prospects are very fair in Europe, but it is necessary we should exert ourselves here, for every advantage we gain this summer will count as so much solid coin. We are in daily expectation of hearing from the General, who has been lately at Connecticut to consult the officers of the French army and navy.

The most powerfull exertions are necessary not only to give weight to the Negociations of our plenipotentiary but to recover our lost territory to prevent the difficulties of the proposition of uti possidetis. Congress are giving the necessary communications to the States and are endeavouring to stimulate them to emulation at this conjuncture which more than ever calls for our own exertions in consequence of our disappointment from France. The aid in money though will it is  JUNE 1, 1781  to be hoped enable us to do something beyond what it would otherwise be in our power to effect. Virga. receiving so little aid from the North occassions many of her Citizens in their Letters to the Delegates to insinuate that as they are at ease and in safety they care not for the southern States. This notion is but too prevalent and is of dangerous tendency to slacken the efforts of the people and more readily dispose them to submission. I hope Your deliberations with Ct. Rochambeau have determined upon relinquishing the Idea of a certain Conquest for the present and shew yourself in Virginia where I think your Name and presence wod. be of infinite service- but my dear Sr. I mention these things with the utmost deference to your own Judgment and feelings which I am sure are equally touched with my own for the distress of numbers in Virga. and as prompt to relieve them as any person on Earth and I am satisfied will do so as far as in your power consistent with the general welfare.(2) We have before us a proposition for sending on an aid of Militia from this State and Maryland but of all assistances these are the worst and wod. avoid them if there was a prospect of more effectual support.(3) Supplies of Arms are gone on and geting ready to go on but these have been greatly delayed for want of money, the weight that defeats every exertion.

  Sir, [June 1, 1781] I am directed to inform you That Congress have received undoubted intelligence, both from their Minister at the Court of Versailles, & the Minister of France in America by order of his Court That the Courts of Vienna & Petersburgh had offered their mediation to the belligerent powers for the re-establishment of peace.(1) That these overtures had been eagerly embraced on the part of G. Britain. That France had declined her full acceptation thereof untill the concurrence of her allies could be obtained for that purpose, at the same time observing, that should she again be pressed on this head, she would be obliged to enter into a previous plan of JUNE 1, 1781  negotiation, conditionally for herself & Allies. That Spain had answered in such manner to the proposals of the mediating powers as to shew her eventual acceptance.  (Thus are we likely to have obtruded upon us by the intervention of two such formidable powers, the hard necessity of acceeding to these overtures at a time when these states are in a less eligible situation to enter into negotiations for peace, than at any other period of the War.)  The intervention of such formidable powers will undoubtedly prove an event the most favourable to these united states if by a great & timely exertion we sufficiently reduce the force of the enemy now operating in our country. But should languor & inaction subject us to the contempt of the negotiators all the consequences will be chargeable upon ourselves.(2) This is a conjuncture that calls for the most serious consideration of these states.  (It is therefore become a question whether we are determined to support this union upon the true principles of the confederation, by rejecting every idea of a diminution or not. If the first is to obtain, Congress are decided in their opinion that there is not a) Congress have not a doubt in their minds but that each State in the Union is determined to support the Confederacy that has been so solemnly entered into, through every difficulty, & hand it down unimpaired to their posterity. Under these impressions Congress can with confidence call on their Constituents for such exertions as are proportionate to the truely critical situation of our affairs. The plan of operations for the present campaign having been preconcerted on the principle of obliging the enemy to abandon their posessions in every part of these states; therefore(3) an unequivocal complyance with the demands heretofore made by Congress for provisions, men, and money, are what we have at present to ask for. Should these means be expeditiously and punctually put into our hands, we have the most pleasing prospect of putting a speedy & happy issue to the war; by driving the enemy from their present possessions in every part of these states; but at all events, to confine them to the Sea coasts; in order to give as little room as possible to the enemy's claim of uti possidetis, which will undoubtedly be most strenuously insisted on by them in the course of the negotiation-a claim totally inadmissible on our part. Of course, then, nothing should be left unessayed by these states, to prevent the embarrassments that such a claim must inevitably produce. Of consequence it is become indispensibly necessary, by our immediate-& under Providence-successful efforts, to place ourselves in such a situation, as to enable our negotiators to speak a firm & decided language, becoming the Characters of the Ministers of Free, Sovereign, & Independent States. We conclude with observing, that from the foregoing communications we are so thoroughly convinced of the most strenuous exertions of every State in the Union to accomplish the great objects herein pointed out, that  JUNE 2, 1781  Congress, will immediately proceed to carry into full execution their plans adopted for defeating the ambitious views of our enemy: & be prepared, to accept of peace upon no other terms, than the Independence of the thirteen United States of America in all their parts.(4)  By order of Congress Sam.

  Dear Sir Philadelphia June 4th. 1781 Sundry letters have been lately received from France dated from the 8th to 20th March. Instead of the second division only a few Ships of the line are to be sent so as to make the squadron at Rhode Island superior to Arbuthnots; they are expected every day. This arrangement took place in consequence of the Dutch war which requires to be cherrished by France. A sum of 6,000,000 livres tournois is granted us as a subsidy the greater part of which is to be laid out in cloathing and Stores for the Army-the remainder to be drawn for by bills. Mr. Franklin had negociated the business of Mr. Laurens mission before he arived and the disposition of the french fleet was made. Count de Grass with 21 sail of the line arived in the West Indias on the 29th of April, Rodney with 17 of the line lay in the way to intercept them coming into Martinique not expecting Count de Grass to be so strong. The Counts first object was to get 153 transports, Merchantmen &c under his convoy safe into Port which he effected and gave 4 sail of the line which lay in port the opportunity to join him. He then attacked Rodney who fled and the Count was pursuing when the Holker left St. Piere and brought a letter from Parsons. We are promised a Naval superiority on the American Seas this campaign; but the contingencies of war may blast the most promising appearances. Admiral Darby sailed from England on the 13th March with 25 sail of the line in order to raise the seige at Giberalter. A vessel just arived from Cadiz, brings advice that Darby effected his purpose without opposition. And that when he came away admiral Cordova with 30 sail of the line lay close in Cadiz because the English Ships were larger, & heavier mettal.  Comodore Johnstone with a small squadron is gone to the East Indias. The French have sent a squadron there also. It is supposed that a squadron of French will, or have joined Cordova.  JUNE 4 1781  The Empress of Russia and Emperor of Germany have offered their mediation between the beligerent powers which has been accepted with an aparent eagerness by the Court of London. France has answered that it is personally agreeable to him; but that he has allies which must be consulted before he can conveniently give a definitive answer. The answer of Spain has been somewhat equivocal, but the measure will doubtless be infinitely agreeable to him. Mr. Cumberland has failed in his object, that of inducing Spain to a seperate peace. The most vigorous exertions on our part are indispensibly necessary in order to expel the enemy or at least to confine them to their strong holds. The enemy will strenuously insist on the proposition of Uti possidatis which is held up by our Ally as totally inadmissable. The Northern army are preparing to attack New York. I forbear making any observations on the propriety of this measure. There are some appearances of the enemys evacuating that post. There are about 7000 of the enemys troops now in Virginia. The Marquis with 900 and Genl. Wayne with 850 regulars to oppose them. We have called upon Pennsylvania for 2000 Militia to be equipped & Marched immediately, Delaware 500, Maryland 1200, to serve to the southward. The legislature is now met here and appears a little more engaged to support the southern states than formerly.  We wish to be relieved; but as the circumstances of our State are so distressing, we have resolved, not to leave the State unrepresented.  Mr. Johnston has written to Mr. Willie Jones and Genl. Caswell. I have written to Colo. Martin.(1) Please to communicate these things to such of our other friends as you may think proper. I could not have written so freely, but expect this to go by some confidential person whom the President will send with some communications to the Executive of our State.

  My dear Sir, Phila. May [i.e. June] 5th. 1781. I thank you for your favor of the first Inst. Censor had much better in my opinion employed his Penn in attempting to heal breaches than to have widen'd them, as to one of the Rulers I do not care how soon he is changed .(1)  The Governor has informed Mr. Carroll that our Supply of Money shall be speedy,(2) & therefore it would be doubting his & the Councils attention at this time to apply immediately to the Genl. Assembly, but our wants are so great that Mr. Carroll who whas been for some days & still continues unwell could not apply to the Doctor because he had not Money to pay him for his Visit & Medic[ine]s. The first Resolution of the Committee of the whole will do very well, the second perhaps is too broad. See what the other States do in this business before you carry your Resolution into a Law. Congress have laid the foundation of a general Bank which will preclude the idea of erecting others. Congress have heard nothing from General Green lately nor of the success you mention.  I expect that General Wayne will be able to join the Marquis tomorrow, and that he will have it in his power to check the progressive Motions of the Enemy.

Subjects of the last importance to the United States are before Congress, and unless we have the assistance of one or two of you in the course of this week it  JUNE 5, 1781  will be too late even for a finger to be put into the Pye, indeed my friend it will turn out as we ever expected, that if there is a peace we shall have very little to say to the Terms of it therefore I wish our State would Stop the Sales of British & Refugee property for at least a Month or two 'till the scene opens a little wider, We can do as some other States do, rub on without it; and however Congress may have spurned at the idea, when Mr. Adams desired instructions on this head, they will I believe now reverse their tone.(5) The King of Great Britain told you by his Commissioners That he would sooner part with his Crown than give up those who had sought his protection, and his obstinacy is unparralelled. Mr. Carroll and I thought of recommending this Subject to the consideration of the General Assembly immediately after the Ministers laid his Memorial before Congress; but upon reflection finding that we were not at liberty to give our reasons for the adopting the measure we agreed to Postpone our interference till we were, concluding that not much would in this respect be done in the mean time.

  Dear General Philadelphia June 5th. 1781.  You will perceive by the papers, that the Belligerent powers under the Mediation of the Empress of Russia and Emperor of Germany are about holding a Congress, and I fear that our Interests will not be so immediately attended to as we might wish: however, I think France must procure us tolerable terms, or She cannot expect to keep us long in her interest, therefore I trust more to her policy than her Justice. She is powerful in the West Indias, & from present appearances could do everything with apparent success, but that of taking Castles, & this She is attempting-strange infatuation.  I wish with all my heart that the Marquis may be able to check Cornwallis. If he should March through St[r]atford & Prince William to Alexandria, I think the Marquis will have charming defensive Ground to make Stands upon.  The Board of War has promised to have ready in 7 days 1500 Stand of arms for our State, Greyson is indefatigable. I expect that the Pennsylva. Assembly now sitting will empower their executive, to send forward immediately four Battallions of Militia to the assistance of Maryland or Virginia as the situation of the Enemy may require.  I wish our State had delayed the Selling of British property a little longer, it would perhaps have been to her advantage to have done so; I do not care to enter in to particular reasoning at this time on the Subject, because it may be thought that I am influenced by former prejudices, and that wiser heads have determined otherwise; but rest assured that I- have greater reason to be of this opinion now than I ever had. I wish you health and happiness and am very truely, Your Affectionate friend, Daniel of St Thos. Jenifer  ""

  Sir, Philadelphia 8th June 1781. I have expected for some Time since, the Determination of the State, respecting their Delegation;(1) but remaining uncertain, Patience has taken the place of Information, and personal Credit removed some of the Inconveniences of local Situation  I wish it was in my Power to give you a particular Account of our Affairs in the Southern States; but we have no very late Intelligence from the Carolina's. A Report by a Flagg from Charlestown has just come to us, that General Greene has gained very capital Advantages over Lord Rawden; but how extensive, Time must determine.(2) Our Finances assume a more favorable Aspect; and I hope will soon be productive of salutary Events. The Enemy are in great Force in Virginia under Lord Cornwallis, and the Troops opposed to them very inferior in Numbers. That State Suffers much, and I am fully Persuaded, will find Relief only in the Exertions of the eastern States. The present Campaign is pregnant with the most important Events; and it is in the Power of the States to render it glorious for America. The Policy of this State [Pennsylvania] has assumed a very respectable Aspect within a few days and I am persuaded will furnish Supplies in a great Measure proportionate to her Resources. The Money of her own Emissions, has risen from seven to four for one, & is still appreciating; while the Money of other States is of very inferior Credit. But as the whole Emissions form a Medium very inadequate to the Sums demanded in Taxation, punctual Payments will bring the whole to a respectable Level, or evince the Necessity of committing it to the Flames, and of relying wholly upon Silver and Gold. The Eastern Male,(3) Which should have come to us on Monday last, has been intercepted on the West side of the Hudson, and carried into New York. Casualties of this kind, however disagreeable, are the natural Consequences of defensive War, when the resisting Army become too feeble to Straiten the Enemy's Lines. I have wished, for a long Time, that the Post Office was abolished, or at least suspended, as more Injury results from than Benefit.

10136,dg017308,1781,John Witherspoon s Speech,"""John Witherspoon's Speech
  Mr President, [June 9? 1781] (1) I am sorry to observe, that after going through the instructions to be given to our plenipotentiary or plenipotentiaries, we should have so warm a debate,(2) and indeed seem to be so equally divided upon the question, whether there should be one or more to whom we will entrust the negociation?  As to the practice of European nations, I believe it is so various as not to afford any argument on one side or the other; we may JUNE 9 1781  appoint one or more-there will be nothing singular or remarkable in it, so as to make our conduct look like ignorance in such matters. I am inclined to think, however, that negociations are generally conducted near to their conclusion, by one confidential person though after the more important preliminaries are settled, more may be sometimes appointed, to give greater solemnity to the conclusion. We are therefore at liberty to determine ourselves wholly by the general reason and nature of the thing, and our own particular circumstances.  As to the first of these, on the side of one person, it may be said there will be more precision, more expedition, more uniformity and more certainty of agreement with others, and consistency with himself. And the person whom we have employed, is a man of sound and clear understanding, and has had the advantage of being a long time in Europe, and no doubt has been turning his thoughts, and making enquiries upon the subject ever since he went there; so that we may suppose him pretty ripely advised.  On the other side, it may be said, that, if alone, he might be at a loss, and that it would be of advantage to him to have the advice of others. It is even said, that there is a necessity of others better acquainted with parts of the country different from those with which he has been chiefly connected. As to council, that does not strike me much-perhaps there is greater safety in one than three; because he is fully responsible; whereas if a common council is taken, the blame is divided, and every one is less difficulted to justify his conduct in the issue. Besides, is there no danger to the cause itself, from an obstinate division of sentiments in those who are entrusted with the conduct of it? This would expose us, in the opinion of those who observed it, and might perhaps give less respect to what each or all of them might say or do.  As to the necessity of persons from different parts of the country, it is not easy to conceive what circumstances, in a negociation of this kind, can be peculiar to one part of the country more than another. If it were to make rules for the internal government, taxation, or commerce of the states, there would be some force in the remark; but when it is only to make peace for the liberty and protection of all, there seems to be little weight in it.  But now let us consider our particular circumstances. Mention has been made of the difference between Mr Adams and the count de Vergennes. I have given particular attention to all that was said in his letter upon that subject, and all that has been said by the minister of France here; and there was not one hint given that could lead us to think it was their desire or expectation that he should be dismissed or superseded, or even bridled by the addition of others in the commission. We have fully complied with their desire upon this subject, in the instructions. There is the greatest reason to think  JUNE 9, 1781  that they are well satisfied upon it. But if we should still go further, and either discharge him, or do what is in substance the same, or might be supposed or conceived by him to be the same, this would rather be an act of too great obsequiousness, and but an ill example for the future conduct of our affairs. What we do now, will be often mentioned in after times; and if the like practice prevail, it will discourage public servants from fidelity, and lessen their dignity and firmness. There is also some reason to fear that there may not be the most perfect agreement among them; and if a jealousy in point of affection between them should arise, it might still be more fatal than a difference in opinion. You may observe, that Dr Franklin particularly mentions the impropriety of having more ministers than one at one court and in the same place. We have felt the bad consequences of that already in more instances than one. Congress were led into such steps as ended in our parting with Mr Lee, chiefly by the argument of his being disagreeable to the French court; and though he was in my opinion one of the most able, faithful, and active servants we ever had, and certainly one of the most disinterested- he was but barely able to go off with a cold ceremonial adieu, that had very little in it of a grateful sense of his services, or cordial approbation. It is not pleasant to reflect, Mr President, that so early in the history of this new state, persons in public employment should be so prone to enter into ambitious contention, and push one another into disgrace.  I cannot help putting you in mind, upon this subject, of what has just now come to light. You are informed by the French court, in the most authentic manner, and indeed if I am not mistaken, it is by implication at least in the king's letter,(3) that you had been ill served by the people you employed there, and cheated both in point of quality and price; and on this account they intend to give directions on that subject themselves. Now, Sir, perhaps it may be news to many members of this body, that these were the very contracts made by Mr Dean, without the knowledge or consent of Mr Lee, of which Mr Lee loudly complained. These were the very servants whose accounts Mr Lee objected to, and whose conduct he censured. But what did he get by it? Mr Dean was supported by his venerable old friend, as he called him: Mr Lee was complained of as jealous and troublesome, and disagreeable to the court of France; and not only opposed and slighted by many members of this house, but I may say attacked and persecuted in such a manner, that if he had not been supported with a generous frankness by others, might have ended in public infamy.  I have just further upon this subject to observe, that you very lately sent a new minister to the French court, Mr Laurens-a measure much disapproved by many; and it was then foretold, it would be a disgraceful thing to Dr Franklin.(4) Probably he has  conceived it in that light; and as he has no desire at all to return home, I am well convinced that this is the true cause of the desire expressed in his last letter to resign his commission.  Some have mentioned the importance of the matter, and that the chance is greater against corruption, where three are to be taken off, than one. It is very true, that ceteries paribus, as is commonly said, there is a greater chance for one incorruptible person in three than in one: but there are single persons in whom I would confide as much as in ten. And besides, the thing may be taken the other way; for there is a greater chance of finding one corruptible person in three than in one; and in a commission of that nature, one traitor is able to do much mischief, though the others are perfectly upright. He, being admitted into the secret, may not only disclose measures, but perplex them, let the abilities of his colleagues be what they will. I have seen a man in Congress, who upon the supposition of his being a traitor, I am sure had address enough to draw many into his measures-many not contemptible in understanding, and sincerely attached to their country's cause.  Before I conclude, I would say a little upon our circumstances in another respect. The first appearances we make upon the public stage, are of consequence. It is to be wished therefore, that the credit of the United States were consulted. If we were sure that our commissioners would be immediately admitted to public and coordinate session with the other plenipotentiaries, perhaps a commission of three would be august and honourable; but if, as I strongly suspect will be the case, they are not at first publicly admitted at all, but obliged to negociate through the plenipotentiaries of France-if, as it is not impossible, even in the settlement of the treaty, we are not considered as the formal contracting parties at all, but our interest attended to in articles as it were occassionally introduced-if this is done as a salve to the honour of England, and to purchase for us advantages substantial and durable, a pompous commission to a number of delegates will rather lessen our dignity, and detract from our wisdom and caution.  Upon the whole, Sir, I am of opinion, that it would be much better to assign to one the commission already given, with the instructions which have been cordially agreed upon, and seem to be in every respect agreeable to the desires of the court of France, and the opinion of the king's minister in this country.

Ogle, 1815), 9:142 47, where it is labelled a \""Speech in Congress, on the appointment of Plenipotentiaries.\""  1 Although this document is not dated, Witherspoon undoubtedly delivered the speech in Congress on June 9 or 11 during the debates over a motion to \""join\"" additional peace negotiators to John Adams as minister plenipotentiary.

Necessity will justify extraordinary measures, and altho the liberty of the Citizens be encroached upon, yet it is to be hoped they will submit; but the Cord may be stretched too tight. That of drafting Blacks is a serious Question should it take place, those not drafted will be miserable, & probably will fly to the Enemy, & those that may be drafted cannot in my opinion be depended upon.  The Negative to the Bill you mention has I suppose sharpen'd Censors pen, I thank you for the paper, and wish you to continue sending me any publications of that sort. Poor Senate! (1) General Green has taken very lately three Posts with 500 Prisoners. Pikins is before 96; which Genl Green expects will soon fall; this is the last Post remaining in S.C. except Chas. Town. I believe that there is not so much disaffection in North Carolina as you imagine. Lord Cornwallis added but 200 to his Corps during his stay in that State. I fear the intelligence of Parkers surprizing Portsmouth is premature, as is that also of Cornwallis's retreating. The Marquis Fayette's not so strong as you immagine. He has taken Post 30 Miles to the Westward of Fredericsburg. I cannot think that France will agree to the Uti possidetis unless compelled to it by the Mediating powers.  Yesterday Congress finished the important business occasioned by dispatches from the Court of Versailles and to the Wish of your Delegates.(2) Great obstructions thrown in the way by Virga., Massachusets & Conectcut especially the former we were several times overthrown but regained our feet again. I cannot say I expect either peace or Truce soon, unless the French should be victorious at Sea. If the independence of the 13 States be acknowledged, the Enemys Ministry or some of them I think will lose their heads probably an act of Parliament may be obtained before a peace takes place to Sanctify the measure. By the Generals Letter to your Delegates which they have transmitted to the Genl Assembly there appears to be a ray of hope.(3) Perhaps the Enemy may have occasion to look behind him.

  Sir, Philada. 13 June 1781. The Bearer of this, a Mr Storer, has applied to me for Information whether any Resolution of Congress exists which may counteract his request of a Comission for an armed Boat to cruize against the Enemy. I do not know of any, and so have told him. I know there have been Instances in which the Crews of such Boats have abused the Confidence of a Commission, and have been guilty of very impolitick and even unjustifiable Acts of Depredation; but these Things might happen in the Case of any armed Vessel; and every Instance ought to stand upon it's own Circumstances. Bonds are always taken when Commissions are granted, and Delinquents are punishable by Forfeiture of their Commissions or by being prosecuted upon their Securities. If there is any Resolution of Congress which apparently discourages a Thing of this Kind, probably it may refute sortaille Parties which make Excursions into the Enemies' Lines merely for the Sake of indiscriminate Pillage contrary to the fair and honourable usages of War; but this I understand to be different from the Object of the Applicant on the present Occasion. This may also be in some Measure guarded against in the Bonds and Instructions, if they are not already sufficiently explicit.  I suppose your Excellency is supplied with Commissions, Bonds and Instructions from the Offices here; and I will observe to you that the Ratification of the Articles of Confederation, enlarges the Power of the respective States in these Matters, as you will find by consulting the 6th Article.

  Philadelphia June the 13th. 1781 I receiv'd, My Dear Genl., your favour of the 3d and agree with you that the complexion of affairs in Virginia is truly embarassing. There must be powerful aid afforded to the army in that Quarter, but from whence they are to come I know not, as the whole of the allied force with considerable draughts of militia from New Hampshire to Pensylvania Inclusive, are to be employed in the Siege of New York. Genl. Washington intends to begin that operation on the first of July. We have had no knowledge of Sir Henry Clinton's being in Virginia, and letters recd. yesterday from the commander in chief take no notice of that matter. This State, Delaware & Maryland have been called on by congress, for Eight battallions of militia-the first for four, the second for One and the last for three batts. for the Service of Virginia. I have my doubts whether the compliance will be as immediate or effectual, as we could wish.  Your letter to Congress was debated two mornings-on various grounds. It produced a Resolve to Genl. W to take every immediate Step to accelerate the court of inquiry. A letter yesterday from the Genl. takes notice of your's to him and of the Resolve-and the satisfaction he would find in doing everything in his power to have the matter effected.(1)  As Mr. Morris did no[t] go to head Quarters, the matter of information you desired cannot be transmitted you. I have no doubt, but he will correspond entirely with your wishes, when he has the opportunity of communication.  We have had a great run of Success in South Carolina & Georgia. I believe the two towns of Savannah & Chs. town excepted-they have lost the whole of both States. I think the expedition to Canada a measure necesary to be pursued-and must be adopted-none can look forward to the command in that department with so much Justice as you.(2)  I will be constant in Writing to you by every proper opportunity. I will in my next, perhaps, have matters of great importance to communicate to you. Do not forget to Write to Congress and Genl. W  I wish you, My Dear Genl., much health and Spirits, and be assured that among your friends, none can be with greater passion for your fame, than yr. faithful & obedt. Servt.  Richd.

  Sir, Philada. 14 June 1781. Since writing your Excellency yesterday I have had an opportunity and Leisure to turn to the Resolution of Congress upon which, I suppose, you hesitated to grant a Comission to Storer. It is of the 22 June 1779, but you will perceive, on Inspection, that the Object of it is no more than I described before.(1) Certainly Persons who recieve Commissions under the requisite Conditions, ought not to be debarred from operating against the Enemy anywhere; but the Intention of this was to prevent pillaging private, Family Furniture and Property of innocent and sometimes well-affected Persons which is contrary to Policy as well as Interest. Certainly making Prisoners of the Enemy, or of obnoxious Citizens, taking publick Property or Merchant-goods and many other Things, and that in any Place whatever, on the Land or on the Water, could not come within the Meaning of the Measure. At the same Time proper Precautions against Abuses of the Rules of War, and Contraventions of the Laws of Nations, are, no Doubt, necessary and proper.(2) I have the Honour to be Your Excellency's very obedt.

  Sir, Philadelphia, June 14, 1781 You will find by the contents of this, that it is a Confidential Letter, conveying you very important and pleasing intelligence.  Congress has received a Letter from the King of France and are also otherwise officially informed by his minister here-That the Empress of Russia threw out an invitation for the Belligerent powers to apply for her Mediation at which the Court of London eagerly Caut and mentioned the emperor of Germany as another mediator and a Congress was proposed to be opened at Viena for the purpose of Settling a general Peace. The answer of the Court of France was that they Could Send no Plenipos. To said Congres Till they had Consulted their allies, but as the Mediators are such respectable JUNE 14, 1781  Powers and may by so fully relied on for Justice, the King presses the United States To Submit to the Mediation and that the first prelimanary he will insist on previous to any other negociation shall be the Independance of the United States in full and upon obtaining this request that the States May be as Moderate in all other demands as possible that the Mediating powers May thereby receive favourable impressions of our Equity and Justice. The same mediating application was made to the Court of Spain and their Answer was that they Could not do any thing but in conjunction with their Ally the King of France-So that the Congress of mediation is likely to be delayed Till our dispatches reach France. However the King says that if he is so pressed that he Cannot decently delay sending a Plenipo. Till that Time he shall insist on the preliminary before mentioned and then only proceed in the negociation so as to have it in such forwardness as will not injure America against their Plenipo. & instructions arrived. The king of France thinks that very equitable terms of peace may be obtained through this mediation, but urges us strongly to exert ourselves this campaign, as the wresting the southern states out of the hands of the British will contribute greatly to Lessen their demands and make them more readily inclined to Equitable Terms of peace-and that our exertions ought to be Quick and Vigirous least a Truce Should Take place, and to ensure the success of this Mediation we ought to make the most ample & Vigirous Prepairations for carrying on the war. Brittain made an Attempt through a Mr Cumberland to negociate a Seperate treaty with Spain, but this has faild tho Mr Cumberland is Still at Madrid. Spain would not Treat but in Conjunction with France, and France Cannot treat but in Conjunction with America. Thus are we linked Together so that the Independance of America now stands on prosperous ground and no further doubt need to remain about it-for this much is Certain all the powers of Europe (Brittain excepted) wish us to be Independant. Thus far in Confidence with this addition that Congress have appointed Doctr. Franklin, J. Adams, J. Jay, H. Laurence, and Governor Jefferson their Principals for settling the peace. They first agreed to appoint but one & Adams was appointed before I came up.(1) They then agreed to add Two Men, Then Jay was appointed-then Jefferson had five votes, Franklin four & Laurence one. The States voted the same way three Times. Then I proposed to the Members of Virginia & Pensylvania that we should appoint them both which being generally agreed to this day was appointed for the purpose & then Lawrence was included also. The appointment now Consists of five. New Hamshire, Pensylvania, Delaware and Maryland were for Franklin, South Carolina for Lawrence and Masichusets, Conecticut, Jersy, Virginia, & No. Carolina for Jefferson-Rhode Island and N. York unrepresented, Georgia absent. Mr. McKean wanted to alter in favour of   Jefferson and leave Franklin out-which upon Georgias coming in, would have carried him; but I would not give up Franklin, and by the manner of proposing to appoint them both, got him appointed-though this was exceedingly against the grain of several members. He will now be put at the head of the commission. His abilities, character and influence are what will be of most use to us in Europe. J. Adams is not much liked at the F. Court. I shall say no more on this head Till I see you. I wish You May find an inclination to Come up to Wilmington as soon as the assembly rises. I have an expectation that the President of Congress & his Lady will spend a few days with us about that Time and he is very desirous to see you.  Green has Taken Camden and Two other posts and we make no dobt but the Brittish have lost every post in Georgia & the Carolinas by this Time except Savannah, Charles Town and Wilmington. Green has had a rapid series of success.  Pensylvania is Determined to be vigirous in giving effectual aid against Cornwallace and there is no doubt but Maryland will do the same. I hope our state will not be behind them, a bold push now obtains us every thing. We have no account of any reenforcements arrived yet to the Brittish from the other side the water. Mr. Morris is gitting our Finances into a better Train and all things now begin to favour us.  I am, yr. Most Obedt. Thomas Rodney  ""

  Sir Philada. June 15th 1781.  Yesterday I wrote you respecting the Congress of Mediation but when I shall have an Opertunity by which I may safely Trust the  JUNE 15, 1781  conveyance of such intelligence is uncertain. This important business has Chiefly Taken up the Time of Congress since I last came up and is now Completed.  It was closed by the decision of an important Article in the instructions to Our Commissioners (1) which requires them after having obtained our Independance in all things else to be Ultimately Governed. by the advice of the French Court or minister. It was moved to reconsider this Clause and to Strike it out as being Too Abject and Humiliating. It was argued some hours and at last rejected so that the Clause stands and the French Court is thereby in possession of full and Sufficient powers to make a peace, for there is not the least doubt but the Mediating powers will readily Consent to our Independance provided they may make it as Simple as possible and it will be even the Interest of France that they should do this least we should at a future day form an alliance with Great Brittain. I was against this Clause because I think it must convince even the French Court that we are reduced to a weak and Abject State and that we have lost all that Spirit and dignity which once appeared in the proceedings of Congress and considering our selves unable to Carry on the War any longer we are ready to Accept of peace on Any Terms; and we may be sure they will not hesitate about granting any thing the Mediating powers may require respecting us after they Consent to Our Independance so that there need be no longer doubt about the Certainty of peace. I am far from thinking we are reduced to a State of such necessaty-Yet what is done for aught I know may be best. We have much relyance on its being the Interest of all the powers Concerned to place us in such a respectable situation that we may not fall a prey to any one of them, and that they may all have an equal opertunity of enjoying the benefits of Our Commerce-And there was some fear that our Plenepotentiaries might make such extravigant demands as would preclude an equitable Peace and in this Case that France would not be obliged to prosecute the War with the direct Object of the Alliance being simply Independance-And Genl. Washington strongly presses the making Peace on the best Terms that can be Obtained. Indeed all the powers of Europe seem so eager to have Great Brittain reduced to a Level with themselves that no danger may arise perhaps from this unlimited confidence which we have placed in the Court of France and indeed where there own interest is not materially in view perhaps she may do better for us than we could for our selves for we may suppose that as a new System of Police is now to be Settled that all the ablest negociators in Europe will be sent to this Congress and our Plenepotentiaries not being so well versed in the refined art of negociation might by them be overeached or mislead more easily than the French who are much better acquainted with the Interests of Europe and inferior to none of them in the Arts of negociation. In  a word if they give us our rank among the nations our Own natural advantages will soon Lift us above them all. Yet I could not help observing on this Occasion a little geeringly to M. Smith of Virginia \""That the great Virginians who alone Talked of Conquering Brittain, were now reduced to the sad necessaty of owning that they were on their knees at the feet and mercy of the French Monarch and had nothing to expect but pray his benevolence\"" for such expressions were made use of by Mr. Maddison [of that?] State, and all there members were on that side of the question except Col. [Bland?].  Every thing respecting this Treaty is required to be kept [secret by] Congress and they are such excellent hands at doing this that I [...] about it almost by Common report before I came up, yet I wou[ld not] have any thing transpire through me. I expect to go home [next] week and wish your business would permit you to be at Wilmington then. Yr. most Obedt. Thomas Rodney  Saturday: June 16th. We have an acct. by an officer from the Eastward that a 50 Gun Ship, Two Frigates and Two flutes with some store ships & 1200 Men are arrived at Boston from France and that the Alliance & a number of American Vessels are also arrived with them.  The operations against New York may be Expected to Commence Shortly. The last Intelligence from Virginia (8th Inst.) says Wain had joined the Marquis-That Lesely with 1000 Men had landed up Potomack. Tarlton had Advanced toward the head of James River to Distroy a large quanty of Stores which were Guarded by the Barron Stuben, and Tarlton & Simco being Too Weak to Effect it Cornwallace was moving that way with his whole Army but the Virginians think that Greens Successes to the Southward will oblige him to Continue his Rout Towards Carolina.

I think I told you I would be more particular, at some future Day, in considering certain Parts of them.(1) I meant to do it by Cyphers; but the present opportunity renders that mode needless. Genl. Ward will probably take a safe Road for himself and consequently for my Scrawl.  \""A captured Letter, not to Portia thank fortune-published by the Enemy-has made some Talk, let the Writer's Conscience tell him whether any Thing ought to escape his Pen, even to a confidential Friend, that might be just occasion of Pain to an affectionate a Wife.\"" \""I have not yet seen it, I fear it is not fit I should.\""(2) As to the Letter Madam, there is one Expression or rather one Mode of Expression that I wish was not there. I am very unwilling that it should be submitted to the Eye of one so very much my Friend as you profess yourself to be. My Enemies are welcome to read it a thousand Times over. It was an unbecoming Levity, and quite unfit for a \""Senator.\"" But it is not that which will give Pain to my affectionate a Wife. She will be pained with what you would smile at. For she is more apt to fear than to despise the Enmity of Little-Great-Folks. I should have submitted the Letter, however to your severe anti-shandean Criticism, if I had not thought that an angried Few would have wisely kept from saying any Thing about it, rather than to make spiteful Interpretations of Parts that did not refer to themselves purely to vent that Malice which had been put into a State of Fermentation by Jemmy Rivington's marginal Notes upon those Parts which did really appertain to their Worthyships.(3) I am persuaded Madam I thus hit upon the authors-original Authors JUNE 16, 1781  I mean, of those Suggestions wch. have troubled you. I did not want to aggrivate their Feelings by giving Communications of what I imagined they would chuse to stifle; that is to say the marginal Notes. By Mr. S. A. I sent to Mr. G (4) the original Print. I assure you there is only the Levity of an Hieroglyphic instead of the Words at home that I regret.  I must now be very serious. There is in the World, in the Hands of one of my best Friends, a Bond of about 80 Pounds Lawful money against me, but I have that amount and more against a Farm mortgaged to me for myself & others, tho' not worth what it is dipped (5) for. This is the whole Connexion I have with Money matters, and a poor one it is, except with my Pay for Time & Service as a Delegate, which ceases the day I arrive in Boston, though my Wife and Children will expect to dine the day after and peradventure they will be extravagant enough to expect it the third Day also. I shall not say much about the Probability, that many of those who have dined & supped formerly, often, for a Course of Years, elegantly both as to the Table & Sideboard, tho not luxuriously, upon the Product of the exemplary Industry of the Usher of a Grammar School, will call to pay their Compliments to the Honorable Delegate of Congress, and wellcome him Home, while He poor Wretch cannot in Return offer them a Glass of small Beer to drink in Case of Thirst.  Do those who condemn my Absence mean to take me into their Stores as a Clerk? Will they risk such a Test of my Desire to live with one of the most faithful endearing Wives within the Circle of my whole Acquaintance, the tender & discrete Mother of my numerous Children, the benevolent Neighbours, the chearful sensible Companion of both Sexes.  \""I must return if only for a short Visit.\""(6) Will they be willing to maint...-But, I shall forget who I am writing to, and shall draw upon myself, and not myself only, a Condemnation of a secret Compact against short Visits. I am told that a Dollar and an Half per Day is to cloathe me as a Delegate, and to support the Wife and the seven Children of the same Delegate! Some of my Boys however begin to help me.  And now Madam, do not think that this serious Subject shall prevent my taking occasion to censure your Sophistry in one part of yr. Letter.(7)  \""What Right has She, who is appropriated, to appear lovely or charming in any Eyes but his whose Property she is?\"" I answer, all that Right & Title which Virtue inherits above Vice.  I am persuaded says a Lady who had seen much of the World, \""That a Woman who is determined to place her Happiness in her Husband's Affections, should abandon the extravagant Desire of engaging public Adoration.\""   I underscore Part to show that it had nothing to do with yr. own Question above.  But I go further, and say, that the Lady needed not to travel to get double the Wisdom of what she here discovers. She might have sat in her Chamber and known that a Woman who is determined to place her Happiness in her Husband's affections not only \""should\"" but would abandon \""the extravagant\"" and even any Desire of Engaging \""public Adoration.\""  \""Portia can join with Juba in the Play. 'By Heavens I had rather have that best of Friend's approve my Deeds than Worlds for my Admirers.' \"" In Troth a very pretty Scrap of a Play! but quoted very unseasonably. For let me ask may not those very Deeds be approved & the Author of them consequently be admired by Thousands & Tens of Thousands; and has not a Wife, as well as a Maid, a Right thus \""to appear lovely & charming to other Eyes than his whose Property she is\""?

  Dear Sir, Philadelpa. June 20th 1781 I must beg the favor of your Excelly to forward the enclosed Letter to London. The Father of Mr. Lowndes who wrote it, is a worthy Citizen, and very desirous of seeing his Son in America before the 1st of March 1782, the time limited by a Law of the State of Maryland for the return of absentees in the British Dominions, under penalty of forfeiting to the State their property.(1) I suppose the Special appointment of Col Laurens to the Court of Verseilles, was a measure that you could not have suspected would have been adopted by Congress. Your having negotiated the business for which he was sent before his arrival, proved, that his errand was unnecessary.  Public bodies in all Countries, and more especially in this New World are too apt to take up, and determine hastily upon Subjects of the greatest consequence. I was absent when that Gentleman was ballotted for; and however the Magot may have bit on that occasion, I can assure you that Congress have the greatest reliance on your abilities, integrity and address, in so much, that it is with pleasure that I can inform you, in the late choice of Ministers to Negotiate a peace you were unanimously elected.(2) JUNE 20, 1781  I have the honor to be with Sentiments of the highest respect and esteem, Sir, Your Excellency's Most obedient and most humble Servt.

  Dear Sr. Phila. 20th June 1781 I have your favour of the 7th instant which gives me intire satisfaction of the propriety of your remaining with the Northern Army and that it was out of your Power from the small Army under your Command to afford any present succour to the southern States.(1) The same Sentiment I find was entertained by Governor Jefferson to whom I presume you have written on the Subject but from the contents of a Letter I have just received (or rather the Delegates of Virga.) from R. H. Lee inclosing one to be forwarded to you I expect you will be further solicited on that head and as it may not be practicable for you speedily to give that Gentleman an answer by safe conveyance from the present situation of the Country I shall as soon as an opportunity offers write to him upon the subject.(2) From all accounts we receive our greatest disadvantage lies in the great superiority of the Enemies Horse wch. being encreased since their advancing into the Country from the number of fine Horses that have fallen into their hands to 7 or 800 to range about the Country as to dismay the people not a little and keep them in continual alarm for the safety of their Families. The superiority of the Infantry I believe consists more in the distinction between  JUNE 20, 1781  regulars and Militia than in numbers. This disadvantage in the Cavalry cannot be surmounted by the State for want of equipment of which they are very destitute. If they had them the Powers given by the Assembly to the Marquis to seize what Horses may be necessary would soon put him in Condition to check their ravages, but at present and untill these equipments can be furnished the Country must be greatly exposed. Cannot you therefore spare Sheldons Horse for this Service and also Vanheers Corps? Every assistance in Cavalry is essential and these may I presume be soon with the Marquis. If you think the last mentd. Horse to be trusted on the Service you will recollect that a part of them are now at Head Quarters or at least I am so informed. The French Cavalry I take for granted from what you say must remain with you otherwise their being well mounted and equiped wod. be of more service than any other assistance you could immediately afford. I wish you to consider this matter of the Cavalry and give such orders as you shall find convenient. I have a Letter by Express from Col. Harrison dated the 8th at Staunton to wch. place the Assembly adjourned after their dispersion and escape from Charlottesville. He writes \""Before this reaches you I dare say you will have heard how narrowly the whole Assembly escaped being made Prisoners by Tarleton at Charlottsville, they had not left the Town an hour before he entered at the Head of 450 Horse and mounted Infantry-some Stores are fallen into their hands with three Delegates and several other Gentlemen amongst them are Mr. Lyons, Mr. Kinlock, Robt. & Wm. Nelson, they are all paroled except Kinlock and him they carried off-had it not been for the extraordinary exertions and kindness of a young Gentleman who discovered their intentions and got round them in the night, not one Man of those in Town would have escaped; as it was, so incredulous were some of us that it was with much difficulty they could be prevailed on to adjourn.  \""We are in a most distressed Condition from the Sea to the Mountains, so many fine Horses have fallen into the hands of the Enemy that they roam at large over all that Country and the Marquis is by no means able to check their progress-he has power given him by the Assembly to impress Horses wherever he can find them but he has not necessaries to mount the Men when he gets them. This being the Case we know not what course to take to preserve the Country from their ravages, we want Arms greatly for Infantry, but when we have them it is difficult to find men to use them, all owing to the danger their Families are in from the Horse. We have 600 fine Men under Baron Stuben wch. he will not carry into action, what are his Reasons I know not, but I can assure you his Conduct gives universal disgust and injures the Service much, the People complaining and with reason that they are draged from their Families at a time when they are most wanted to make bread for  them, whilst the Soldiers they have hired at a very great expence lay Idle-in short my dr. Sr. his Conduct does great mischief and will do more if he is not recalled, and I think it behoves you to bring it about. I assure you it is the wish and desire of every Man that this event shod. take place; I believe him a good officer on the Parade but the worst in every other respect in the American Army. I like the Marquis much and so does every Body in the Country but is he not too young for such a command as he has, and of such great consequence to the American Cause and this great Country-would not St. Clair think you from his experience be usefull here.  \""We have now no Executive in the State for want of a Senate the Govr. will act no more, and the remainder of the Council will not get together. I hope we shall set these matters right next week.\""  A Copy of a Letter from the Marqs. of the 3d inst. to Genl. Greene (3) intimates that he was ignorant till lately that Genl. Greene had ordered these levies to act in Virga. but it does not appear he had orders from Genl. Greene upon the subject as he complains in the Letter that he had not heard from him for some time. Perhaps your interposition may be necessary upon this business to prevent misunderstanding. How far Col. H.'s opinion abt. the Baron requires your interference You will judge. I had heard some complaints of that Gentn. before I left the State but attributed them to his being long in the Milatary line, unacquainted with the civil institutions and disgusted that his requisitions were not immediately complied with, rather than any other quality-however if he has disgusted the people prudence requires he shod. not be detached, but subject to the controul of some superior officer or recalled. These matters you will direct as you shall see best for the Service. Could not Genl. Greene be well spared from the South to take the Command in Virga. The great scene of action is there, and as you cannot be present, his Abilities and experience may be very usefull. Excuse the haste of this Letter wch. I have been obliged to write in Congress and believe me with perfect esteem, D Sr., Yr. aff Friend & Sevt. Jos. Jones.  ""

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia, June 21st. 1781. Congress having received some important Communications from the Minister plenipotentiary of France respecting the Intentions of the Courts of Petersburgh & Vienna, have come to some Determinations thereupon which are not only interesting to the united States in general, but to the State of Virginia in particular; I took the Liberty therefore to insist that you should be added to the Ministers of these States already in Europe, that the State of Virginia particularly & the united States in general might have the Benefit of your abilities in a Negociation that may probably take place. I am not at Liberty to communicate to you explicitly by a Letter, the Objects that will require your attention, or the Nature of the Restrictions by which you will be bound. You will therefore not be able to determine whether the Embassy will be agreeable & honourable; but, I am confident that you cannot fail of rendering very essential Services to the State by your intimate Knowledge of its Interests; and I am persuaded that it can only be requisite to suggest to you that the Business will be very important and your Usefulness in negociating it very great, to induce you to accept the Appointment.(1) Exertion & Unanimity are now more than ever requisite in the State of Virginia. Assistance will come but slowly; but I beseech you to avoid Despair. It can only produce Divisions which will encrease your Distresses without procuring for you one valuable End. This State and some others in the union, enjoy most of the Blessings of Peace; and, attentive to other objects more pleasing, they are not willing to beh'old the Distresses of Virginia. Congress is so destitute of Money & consequently of Power, that if there was the most cordial Disposition to give immediate & effectual assistance to the State, it is not practicable. I have no Doubts however, but that the Campaign JUNE 21, 1781  will end favourably for us, and it is not improbable that it may be the last. This latter Circumstance will depend greatly upon the firmness & Exertions of Virginia; as the Influence of the mediating Powers in Europe will probably be exerted in our favour [in pr]oportion to our Success. At all Events, it [will be] very important for us to deprive Britain of an Alliance which her Successes in America may encourage.  My Situation here is really distressful, I have not had any authentic Intelligence concerning my family & Estate since the month of April, having designed to leave this City on the first of May, which prevented any Letters from being written to me, if the Communication had not otherwise been cut off. I am the more distressed because my funds will not enable me either to stay or to go from hence.(2) However the Virginia Delegates are not the only suffering Delegates here, & they must submit to the Hardship of the Times. I hope it will not be of long continuance; and [be] assured that while I do remain here, I shall not neglect to try every Expedient which may promise any Relief to the State.

It gave me much Satisfaction to hear of your safe arrival in France and that you had proceeded on the business of your embassy-the letters of March the 20th in cyphers came Safe (1)-and your mode of executing was agreeable to congress. I wish you may Succeed in the great point, of the naval Superiority. This alone can enable us to wage an equal war with the foes of our independence. The interests of France and these States are so united, that any unnecessary delay in establishing the independence of the latter is a real detriment to both.  We have appointed five commissioners to manage the business which had been entrusted heretofore to Mr. Adams-your father is one of the member-Doctor Franklin, Mr. Jay and Governor Jefferson-are also joined in the Commission. We have passed a resolve authorising our plenipotentiary to offer Genl. Burgoine in Exchange for your father and hope it will prove Successful (2)-as his Services will be much wanted. Should the mediating powers be in Earnest to terminate the disputes among the beligerent powers, I  JUNE 23, 1781  can give you no opinion for prudential reasons of matters here and have only to observe that perseverance in pushing the great object of a naval force is all that can be expected and I can assure you that the Scattered form of the british in America, would render them an Easy conquest at this time.

The Assembly is now sitting at this place (2) and it is said discover a disposition to do great matters, but you know these people better than I do and can better Judge what is to be expected from them. You will before this reaches you have heard that a Negociation for peace is on foot in Europe under the Mediation of the Emperor & Empress Queen of Russia. The Events of this Campaign will determine whether America is to reap any Advantages from this Measure. We have the most friendly and unequivocal Assurances from our Ally that our Interest will be attended to and that he will make good on his part every thing that he has undertaken.  We have just heard of a Reinforcement having arrived at Charlestown on the 10th of this month said to consist of about two thousand men, three thousand were said to have embarked in that JUNE 23, 1781  fleet, the remainder are supposed to have gone to the West Indies or come to Virginia.

The Ship Marquis De la Fayette is likewise said to have arrived in one of the Eastern ports with Arms and Cloathing but this last wants confirmation. We have Letters from Paris as late as the fourth of April but they contain nothing of an interesting Nature.

It has been some time since we have had any officially here, either from the Eastward or Southward. The last Eastern mail was Taken by the enemy, the week before last, with the general  JUNE 23, 1781  Rochambeaus dispaches, but no others of any importance, and his were in such Cypher as the enemy could not Decypher. By an Officer who the Genl. sent express since we had an Account of the arrival of a fifty Gun ship, Two Frigates and Two flutes with 12 Transports and 1500 men, to reunit the Fleet and Army at Rhode Island-by which the French Fleet will be Equal if not Superior to the Brittish, so that it may be expected that the operations against New York will Commence as soon as the Commander in Chief Can be prepaired-but he has not yet a sufficient Stock of provisions, however we hope this impediment will soon be removed. The last accounts from Virginia inform that Cornwallace was bending his Course toward the head of James River to Distroy our Stores there which were Guarded by the Barron Stuben & about 800 Malitia- That Lesly was gone to Potomack with about a 1000 Men-That Genl. Wain had joined the Marquis-That with there regulars and about 3000 Malitia they were moving after Cornwallace with Intention to give him Battle, That the western Malitia were joining Our Troops very fast-That Genl. Smallwood with 500 Regulars and a 1000 Malitia was on his march from Maryland to Join the Marquis. The last accounts from Genl. Green Left him Carrying on his regular approaches against Ninety Six, while Pickens and Lee were at Augusta and we have good reason to hope these posts are in Our possession before now for the Refugees are many of them flying from Charles Town to Virginia being alarmed at Greens success. The Pensylvania assembly is now on the Subject of Giving all the Aid in there power to Virginia but I fear the desention that prevails in this State will greatly impede even their best endeavours. Great part of the people are daily abusing Government for being too severe and great part of them Equally abusing it for being too Lenient, so that you may easily see what difficulties lay in there way.  I am very Anxious to hear that our Assembly have reformed their Malitia Law and done every thing else in their power to put the state in the best possible posture of defence for If our army in Virginia should be unfortunate a strong Detachment of the Enemy may be Expected to Cross the Bay. The Maryland assembly have increased their Malitia on duty to Two thousand-and I think it would have been well in Delaware to have adopted a similar plan. These Malitia are in pay every day they Exercised (2) and are liable to be imbodied whenever called for. But it was unfortunate that our assembly sett at Lewis quite out of the way of intelligence. I have not had a line from them nor had an opertunity of writing to them since they met. I very much fear they have not been sufficiently informed to do what was necessary at the present Crisis, and harvest drawing near has probably hurried them home sooner than I would wish as the present time requires particular and extraordinary exertions to Complete our Glorious struggle for Liberty.

  Dear sir, Philadelphia June 26th 1781 I recd yours of 28th May by yesterdays mail. This is the only letter I have recd. from you: and this I suppose has been detaind at Fishkill for want of a post rider as one of our postriders with his mail were taken & carried to York abt. begining of June.  You have doubtless recd. sundry of my letters (1) before this time informing of my arrival &c and of the bad state of the currency: Since which I have drawn on you in behalf of the state two small bills the first 133 1/3 dolls. the second 266 2/3 dollers which I suppose will come to hand before this.  If this meathod of supply be disagreable I beg some other may be pointed out, or that I may be informed of the pleasure of the Court.  I have between 8 & 9 hundred dollers of the new emission dollers & several thousand of the old: but paper mony is of no use. The court would be unwilling to have me put away the paper at 6 or 7 for one which they must redeem in so short a time.  JUNE 26, 1781  As to Vermont I am sorry to see the distressed situation we are in by the policy of a few. The affair might have been settled a year ago, upon the plan I proposed. (2) But the rejecting that has irritated the people on the grants, on both sides of the river, and given our enemies the advantages they now possess. We have no delegate from New York as yet & Congress has been very thin 'till very lately: as soon as any thing can be done I shall do the utmost to bring matters to a settlement: But which way it will be settled I am at a loss. Your letter will be of great use, I am perswaded, in exciting the attention of our friends in congress. I shall accordingly shew it to a number of them.  They must see that Rome or Carthage must be demolished. I am very strongly impressed with an idea that this dispute will never be settled but by dividing the territory between N York & us: but I have no authority to act on this plan. Genl. Sullivan has expresst the same sentiment to me lately. Should the whole be decreed to us they might be too powerfull under the influence of Mr Allen to obey the decree: Should they be divided that part that would fall to us wd. perhaps be easily reconciled.  The Ship Franklin which arrived here from France last week had a very long passage, consequently brought no news.  You will observe the Brittish & Tory news everywhere holds forth that America is to be excluded from the negotiations for peace; But depend on it the fact is otherwise.

  Dear Sir. Philadelphia, June 27th, 1781. I was only yesterday favored with the letters which you were so obliging as to write me the 14th of April and 10th of May last. I have wrote to you frequently by casual opportunities, but cannot have any confidence of your having received my letters. I write by this opportunity to my brother, and must refer you to his letter and the enclosed newspaper for news. I am sorry people were in such haste to remove themselves and property from Edenton. I rather could have wished they had thought of defending it, which would have been attended with less risk and expense in my opinion, for till the conquest of Virginia is effected, which I flatter myself will not speedily take place, I scarcely think you will be molested with any considerable invasion, and if the plundering parties meet with opposition they will grow sick of the business. However, every one will and has a right to judge for himself on these occasions. So far as it respects me, I am perfectly satisfied, and shall ever consider myself under the highest obligations to you on this occasion for your friendly attention. I have been detained here longer than I expected from unavoidable circumstances, which I shall have the pleasure of communicating when I can see you. I hope to leave this place some day next week (1) but as it will be necessary for me to take a pretty extensive circuit to avoid the enemy's horse, and the weather being too warm for me to make long days' journeys at this season, I cannot form to myself any judgment respecting the time I shall arrive with you. I am truly sensible what anxiety and distress you must all have sustained in your alarming situation. I have often wished to have been with you on the occasion; indeed my mind has been so much in that country, that it has rendered me almost incapable of attending to any thing elsewhere. This will probably be a very important,  JUNE 28, 1781  though perhaps not a decisive campaign. I am not perfectly informed of the plan on which it will be conducted on our part, nor is it proper that I should communicate so much as I do know to paper. Should a few fortunate events cast up in our favor, I hope there will be no more of it after this summer-if otherwise, God knows where it will end, for America can never submit.  Pray remember me most affectionately to my sister and the children. I grow every day more impatient of being absent from my friends; and had I not believed my services, or rather my vote essentially necessary here for some time past, no importunity should have detained me. Present my compliments to such as you may think them acceptable, particularly my old friend Mr. Barker, and believe me with the greatest truth and sincerity, Yours.  P.S. Tell our friend Hooper I have just received his letter of the 16th of March last, but postpone writing to him till my return, not thinking it safe to be more particular than the above, which you will be so good as to communicate.

  Sir Philadelphia June 29th. 1781 Since our letters of the 3d and 8th of this instant (1) which we hope have come safe to your hands, nothing of importance has occurred nor have we been so happy as to receive any of your letters since that which you did us the honor to write from Tarborough on the 3d of last month.

By our last accounts from the West Indias Admiral Rodney had made no attempt to relieve St. Lucia, it is therefore highly probable that our allies are, before this, in possession of that place and will soon be in a condition to afford us more effectual aid on this coast.  We have been long endeavouring to procure and send forward arms for our Soldiers and have now got that matter in so promising a train that we hope soon to have fifteen hundred stand of arms and some amunition sent forward. This should be mentioned with caution.  We have been extremely unfortunate in transporting supplies of cloathing and Military Stores from Europe & the west Indias, so that some of these articles are rather scarce at this time, We should however be glad that you would signify from time to time what you are most in want of that your delegates may endeavour to secure them for you at such times as they may be had.  By the british publications in New York it would appear that a great number of the inhabitants of our state had applyed for paroles, their account we hope is greatly exaggerated. After so great an expence [...] it would be highly inglorious to submit when in all probability a short struggle will crown us with success and secure to us the fruits of our labors.

  Sir June 29th 1781.(1) The report of the Committee appointed to state the amount of the public debts and to estimate the expences of the current year which was agreed to by Congress on the 18th of April last and of which you have been furnished with a copy will give you a general view of the requisitions from the States and on which Congress rely for the operations of the present campaign. But to enable you to judge how far those requisitions are likely to be productive it may not be amiss to state more particularly and analise the several requisitions beginning with that of March 18th 1780. By this act it was intended to draw in the whole two hundred millions old currency which had been emitted and in lieu thereof to issue ten millions of dollars, four millions of which were to be subject to the orders of Congress and applied to the general defence; the remaining six millions were to belong to the several States in proportion to the sums assessed upon each. JUNE 29, 1781  The following table will shew the sums of old money to be brought in by the several States, the sums of new money to be issued in lieu thereof and also the sums of the said new money which the several States were to have received for their own use and the sums reserved for the general defence and which were subject to the orders of Congress.  Old money to be levied by 6/10 be- 4/10sub- the several States by the act New money longing ject to the  of 18th March 1780 & to be to be to the orders of cancelled issued State Congress Newhampshire 5,200,000 260,000 156,000 104,000 Massachusetts 29,900,000 1,495,000 897,000 598,000 Rhode Island 2,600,000 130,000 78,000 52,000 Connecticut 22,100,000 1,105,000 663, 000 442,000 New York 9,750 000 487,500 292,500 195,000 New Jersey 11,700,000 585,000 351,000 234,000 Pensylvania 29,900,000 1,495,000 897,000 598,000 Delaware 2,210,000 110,500 66,300 44,200 Maryland 20,540,000 1,027,000 616,200 410,800 Virginia 32,500,000 1,625,000 975,000 650,000 North Carolina 13,000,000 650,000 390,000 260,000 South Carolina 15,600,000 780,000 468,000 312,000 195,000,000 9,750,000 5,850,000 3,900,000 But as South Carolina from the invasion of the enemy has not had it in its power to take any measures for complying with this act, its quota ought to be deducted  viz. 15,600,000 780,000 468,000 312,000 179,400,000 8,970,000 5,382,000 3,588,000 Hence it appears that until there are farther measures devised for calling it in, there will remain of the old money in circulation the sum of 20,600,000, And that the United States can only calculate upon 3,588,000 dollars of the new emission. If North Carolina should also fail and there is but too much reason to fear it will, then there will remain of the old money in circulation the sum of 33,600,000, and there will only be emitted of the new money the sum of 8,320,000 of which 3,328,000, only will be subject to the orders of the United States. New York from its sufferings and situation will stand in need of some assistance and indulgence. It has made application to Congress for leave to apply the 4/10 arising from its quota, to the discharge of the debts due to its inhabitants for   extraordinary supplies furnished to the Army. This has not been complied with in express terms but I believe Congress have been sparing in their draughts on the loan officer of that State and the draughts made have been principally applied to the purpose abovementioned. The following table will shew the State of this account as it stands in the books of the treasury Office June 4th 1781.

The  apportionment to the States was to be agreeable to that of the 7th Octor 1779 as follows. viz.  Newhampshire 80,000 Massachusetts 460,000 Rhode Island &c. 40,000 Connecticut 340,000 New York 150,000 New Jersey 180,000 Pensylvania 460,000 Delaware 34,000 Maryland 316,000 Virginia 500,000 North Carolina 200,000 South Carolina 240,000 3,000,000 Georgia being invaded was excused for the present. From the situation of affairs in North Carolina and South Carolina I am apprehensive no reliance is to be placed on their quotas.  The following is a state of this account according to the returns from the board of treasury dated 4th June 1781.  Sums drawn for or allowed balance due New Hampshire 80,000 80,000 Massachusetts 460,000 224 63/90 459,775 27/90 Rhode Island 40,000 40,000 Connecticut 340,000 340,000 New York 150,000 18,825 131,175 New Jersey 180,000 5,149 174,851 Pensylvania 460,000 13,740 446,260 Delaware 34,000 34,000 Maryland 316,000 316,000 Virginia 500,000 1,200 498,800 North Carolina 200,000 200,000 South Carolina 240,000 240,000 3,000,000 39,138 63/90 2,960,861 27/90 But if the quotas of North and South Carolina are deducted from this balance then there will only remain 2,520,86127/so and of this sum I am inclined to think some of the States have applied a part towards the payment of interest due on loan office certificates and some other of the States will have charges to make for forwarding or transporting provisions agreeable to the recommendation of the 14th May last and possibly for some other services performed. Of these no account is yet rendered.   On the 4th of Novr. 1780 the States were called upon to levy in the proportions hereafter mentioned a tax equal in value to six millions of silver dollars to be paid partly in specific articles at prices therein fixed and partly in gold or silver or bills emitted pursuant to  the act of 18th of March 1780 viz.

What proportion of the articles are furnished I cannot say as the Commissary general has made no returns, But from the return of the board of treasury of the 4th of June 1781 it appears that no payments in money have been made by any of the States, consequently the whole sum of 1,642,987 2/3 remains due, one quarter part of which viz, 410,746 82/90 being payable the first of May last ought to be called for.  On the 8 January 1781 As our prisoners in the power of the enemy were suffering for want of necessaries Congress called upon the States from Newhampshire to North Carolina inclusive to procure and forward to the treasurer of the United States or to the Commissary of prisoners appointed to reside at New York by the first day of March 1781 for the use of the Officers in captivity at that  place and on Long Island the following sums in specie or bills of exchange on some Merchant in New York viz,  Newhampshire 2,319 Massachusetts 13,334 Rhode Island 1,160 Connecticut 9,855 New York 4,347 New Jersey 5,217 Pensylvania 13,334 Delaware 987 Maryland 9,159 Virginia 14,492 North Carolina 5,797 Amounting in the whole to 80,000 dollars. No part of this has been paid into the continental treasury. Whether any part has been transmitted to the Commissary of prisoners at New York I cannot undertake to say. But this matter should be enquired into. On the 15th of January 1781 the States from Newhampshire to Pensylvania both inclusive were called upon for their respective quotas of 879,342 dollars for the immediate pay of arrears due to the Army.  But by a letter I have this day received from the board of treasury I find that warrants were drawn for that sum on the Commissioners of the loan offices of those States and that it was paid out of the 4/10 reserved for the use of Congress, and consequently has no effect on the requisitions from the States.  On the 16th March last the States were called upon for a farther sum of six millions of dollars to be paid quarterly. The first quarterly payment amounting to one million five hundred thousand dollars to be made on the first day of June.  The quota of each State was fixed as follows  Newhampshire 46,080 3/4 The four qu[arterl]y paymts 184,323 Massachusetts 264,965 3/4 ................ 1,059,863 Rhode Island 29,146 1/4 ................... 116,585 Connecticut 195,844 1/4 . . . . . . . . . . 783,377 New York 43,200 3/4 . . . . . . . . . . 172,803 New Jersey 103,682 ......................... 414,728 Pensylvania 264,965 3/4 ................ 1,059,863 Delaware 24,480 1/4 . . . . . . . . . . . 97,921 Maryland 182,026 3/4 . . . . . . . . . . 728,107 Virginia 288,006 1/2 ................. 1,152,026 North Carolina 57,601 .......................... 230,404 Total 1,500,000 6,000,000 JULY 2, 1781  It is to be observed that the sums assessed are not to be considered as the just proportion of any State, but being paid into the treasury are to be placed to their respective credits and to bear an interest of six per cent per annum from the time of payment until the quotas shall be finally ascertained agreeably to the articles of the confederation; and if it shall then appear that any State is assessed more than its just quota of the taxes called for it shall continue to receive interest on the surplus and if less it shall be charged with the interest on the deficiency until by a future tax such surplus or deficiency shall be adjusted.  It may be proper to observe that on the 25th of Feby. 1780 when Congress called for specific supplies from the States they had in contemplation the raising certain articles to be shipped to Europe in order to discharge some debts due in the West Indies, to provide a fund for defraying the expences of their Ministers at foreign Courts and for paying the interest of money borrowed abroad and therefore among the specific articles Maryland was called on for 1000 hhds Tobacco and Virginia for 6000. By a letter from the Governor of Virginia sometime last fall it appears that measures were taken by that State for providing the quantity required. But as nothing has ever been done in that matter the whole 7000 hhds remain and may be applied to such purposes as you judge proper.  The above is the best account I can give you of the several requisitions of money and supplies from the States and I hope they are stated with such precision as will enable you to call upon the States and to press a compliance with the said requisitions.  I am, Sir, your Obedient humble Servt, Cha Thomson.  ""

  Sr. Fairy Hill near the falls of Shuilkyll, July 2d. 1781 In my last (1) I had the honor to inform Yr. Excelly. that your letter which came enclosed to me directed to the Govr. of Virginia was forwarded by express. The departure of the Chevr. de La Luzerne for camp affords me this opportunity of acquainting your Excellency that your request respecting the Rifflemen, from this state has been this day enforced by a requisition of Congress, (2) in the terms containd in your letter but not without some opposition from the delegates of this state, which excited no small surprize in me seeing JULY 2, 1781  the requisition was in every sense so necessary and proper. The Exertions of Rhode Island and some of the other States make a happy Contrast to this disposition. We have great reason to believe from a letter of Col. Cary Sp. of the Sen. of Virginia, (3) that Ninety Six fell before General Greene the latter end of May, as he mentions having seen a letter from a Capt. Pearce of the 24th of May who says the Enemy had made a Sally but were repulsed with Considerable loss & there was little doubt but that a few days wd. deliver it into our hands.(4) The Same fate it is expected wd. befall Augusta, but of this no certain intelligence has come to hand officially. It may be some Satisfaction to your Excelly. to be assured that Col. Cary has informd us that altho the Enemy have penetrated so far and in such force into our Country (Virginia) not twenty People have Joind them, and not one of those Natives, except Negroes-and a universal and unanimous Spirit of oposition prevails among all ranks of People, the same accounts inform us that the Marquis is above Six thousand strong-& that Lord Cornwallis is extremely weakend by sickness and desertion-the latter was lowdown on James River, & the Marquis below Richmond within 20 miles of him. I was Sorry to find on waiting on Mrs. Washington that she has been indisposed, and hoping that the Country air will be more beneficial to her than the Town, have requested that she will take up her Quarters with us at this place which I have some hopes she will do in a day or two as soon as she has rested from her fatigue.

  Dr. Tucker Fairy Hill near Philadelphia July 3d 1781 Yesterday brought me your agreeable favor of the 25th of May, four weeks having elapsed since I had received a Single line from any creature in Virginia. I began to think myself either totally forgot, or that the Enemy (in their Savage Phrase) had Cut you all up. It is somewhat unaccountable, that none of my Friends of late think it worth while to give me the smallest intelligence about my affairs nor indeed very little other intelligence but what is a month old before it gets here-from whence I conjecture, that they think it of no consequence to transmit the news of any event as early as possible to this place, but it is sufficient if they make a record of it at their Leisure. I assure you this is not the Case ergo I request that you will either by yourself or by establishing a Correspondence with those near the scene of action transmit me the earliest intelligence possible, as it is at this Juncture a matter of great moment. Happy indeed am I to hear that our Countrymen have so distinguishd themselves by their Zeal for our Just Cause, and that they have at JULY 3, 1781  length determined to look at home for their deliverance. Believe me this is the wisest step that any nation or people can persue-it wipes of[f] every Suspicion of backwardness with which our Country has been sometimes ungenerously reproached. It shews ourselves our own strength and power when collected is not so contemptible, as some have inferred from our dispersed situation and it has this good effect that when our neighbours see we are able to help our selves they will be fonder of assisting us. However you may be assured that we have watch over you with a Parents Eye, and have left no stone unturnd to yield you every possible aid that our Circumstances wd. admit. The time of your deliverance we hope is near at hand, but god grant that my Country men slacken not in their endeavors, but persevere in the most vigorous measures as well for defending themselves as for preventing future attacks-this alone can be done (with out a Superior Navy) by organizing the Militia and fortifying the proper passes of the Rivers against small attacks and invasions which are not only ruinous but disgracefull. In answer to your request relating to Yr. Brother I have to inform you that Congress have at length agreed to make good the depreciation to the Medical Staff of the Army whereby your Brothers pay will be secured to him in Specie or its equivalent.(1) The mode by which the payment is obtaind is through the Channel of the Purveyor who returns abstacts or estimates to Congress on which warrants Issue on the treasury for the new Bills or Specie (as the case may be with the treasury). A Doctor Brownson is deputy purveyor for the Southern Hospitals, and if I mistake not that Gentn. has already received a Warrant for this purpose. My own finances have been of late in so deranged a state that I have been reduced to the last Shilling, and to borrow from every Quarter & at length driven by sheer necessity to draw a Bill on Mr. Banister for £100, Specie which I must rely on my friends to make up by some means in the actual Stuff-as nothing else will do here, nor for the purpose for which this bill is intended-not having drawn one shilling from my own funds since I left Virginia and having at least double that Sum due to me besides the Produce of my Crops, &.c.&.c. I hope my honor will not suffer in this first attempt, and I must rely on you to Jog the memory of Mr. Sturdevant. My father, Mr. Yates Sc Mr. Banister I have written to on the same Subject.(2) Our Grand Army has taken the field and formd a Junction with the french troops near New York. A very large Body of Militia are collecting and Collected from the Eastern States and every preparation made or making for a Vigorous attack on N York. I expect the trenches will be opend in a few days. Large reinforcements are calld for, and I hope will soon march from this State, Delaware, and Maryland, both of horse, foot & artillery, to reinforce the Southern armies. Our money matters are beginning to look up, under the management of Mr. Morris our new Superinten-  dant of finance and in short by these [when] the Congress of the powers of Europe meet for establishing a peace I hope the Congress of the American powers, will cut no despicable figure, but this requires the utmost & most continued exertion of every Nerve, both in the Council & in the field. My time is short I have only one moment to tell Fanny that I love her, that I long to receive one more letter from her fair hand-that my anxiety for her welfare has been perpetual & that nothing can relieve me but an assurance from her self that she is well and happy, at least as much so as the times will admit of.

  Dr. Sr. Phila. 3d July 1781 Such has been the situation of Virginia for some time past we have had but little and that very imperfect intelligence of the transactions there. This may have been the case with you and yesterdays Post being the only one for some weeks that brought us Letters I inclose one received from Col. Carey (1) for your perusal knowing that your acquaintance with that Gentleman will readily account for his prolixity and some inaccuracies.  Col. Temple who arrived here a few days ago to forward M[oyla]ns Dragoons and which he expected to meet on the road shewed me a Letter dated the 21st ult. from the Marquis pressing him to use all possible dispatch to join him with that Corps of Horse-that the Enemy had left Richmond and were mo[ving] down towards Williamsburg. It is many weeks since [t]his State was requested to equip this Cavalry and send them to the Marquis's Army (2) and we have been amused week after week that at least sixty of them were ready to march and sometimes told they were marched but such has been the supineness of this assembly they are not yet equiped and must be sent to Virga. to be mounted if money can be procured to pay them part of what is due them for back pay. The Militia called for, to go to the southward will not be raised, and difficulties have been started to the 300 particular militia you requested but I am in hopes they will be furnished. I will pardon all this if they fill up their continental line wsh. they say is their design-in the mean time they escape sending Militia either South or North unless the 300 you asked for are supplied. Our affairs have taken a most favourable turn to the South and I hope the Spirit of the people in that quarter is now so much roused that they will not be again reduced to the distressed State they were lately in. Their present resentmt. is high, and though partly ravaged the Country yet abounds with resources which when properly applied will make them formidable-could the Enemy but get a check by water in Virga. in that State every thing wod. soon be restored and their insolence as much humbled as lately it has been insulting.

  Sir, Philadelphia July 3d, 1781. I inclose you the Paper of this date.(1) It contains an Act of the Legislature of this State with the Answer and Ingagements of the Superintendent of Finance. At first View, this Transaction may appear a little odd to Gentlemen unacquainted with the Policy here. To prevent therefore any unfavorable Impressions, I have thought it my Duty to observe, that large Arrearages are due from this State in Specific Articles, particularly Flour. The State have made large Assessments & placed their Revenue in the Hands of Mr. Morris; By these means he will be able to anticipate their Taxes in the Receipt of Arrearages upon a Credit, wch. these Funds will enable him to support.(2) His Personal Credit here, as well as in Europe, is very extensive, And no other Man could affect as much as Mr. Morris. We have already experienced the happy Consequences of his Appointment in a vast Retrenchment of Expences. He is now taking effectual Measures for simplifying the various Departments, and calling to Account, those who have basely wasted the public Funds. In Republicks so delicately connected as those of the united States, Reformation of Abuses is difficult in the first Instance, and must be extremely gradual when we consider the total Derangement of our Finances, bordering almost upon irretrievable Ruin by the progressive Operation of several Years mistaken Policy. The Evils have been so multiplied, and the Indemnities so certain In the Estimation of public Servants, that sporting with public Property has become familiar; And the Multiplication of Dependents, in every Departments, has been so enormous that the Feelings as well as Views of many Individuals will be greatly affected by the necessary Alterations. Their Resentments will naturally be directed against those who have ventured to strike at the Foundation of their unnecessary and destructive Establishments. I have only to lament that in a public Body, consisting of many Members, the Transition from inefficacious to efficient Systems is begun with Caution & perfected thro' much Delay. This arises partly from the Constitution of deliberative Bodies, and partly from that Attachment to preexisting Opinions and Measures, wch. have been long connected with Habit. From an Attention to the latter Source, I am led to apprehend, that some Gentlemen, who have been long in the Councils of America, will feel themselves chagrined at the Adoption of Plans so repugnant to their Inclinations. This may induce them to reembrace their  JULY 3, 1781  favorite Schemes with Eagerness, and endeavor to pr[eju]dice the People against Measures, the uninterrupted Operation of wch. will unfortunately expose them, while it enhances the public Good. We shall soon compleat a total Reduction of a great Number of expensive Boards; Order and Economy will be introduced into the Expenditures, by lessening the Number of Persons employed & by establishing a fixed Responsibility. From these Reforms alone, I can take upon me to affirm that the public will annually gain several Millions of specie Dollars. An important Consideration, when we reflect what Relief it will affoard the People, already groaning under the Burtherns of enormous Taxes. I must now take the Liberty of subjoining, that from the Knowledge, Integrity, & Credit of the Financier, we may expect the Most beneficial Events from his Administration. But he must be supported by the States. Time will gradually unfold the Propriety of this Institution, & reestablish Respectability and Importance in the American Character.  We have not lately received any official Accounts from Genl. Greene; but by Information, nearest to absolute Certainty, he has reduced Ninety six and Augusta, & consequently possesses all the Carolina's and Georgia, excepting Charlestown and Savanna. Lord Cornwallis is retiring towards the Shore; and it is very probable the Movements of his Excellency General Washington have induced Sir Henry Clinton to think of recalling the whole, or a part of those Troops. The Marquis la Fayette has a more numerous Army than his Lordship, & as a very respectable part of this Army is composed of continental Troops and Riflemen, the Consequences of an Action are not much to be dreaded. They were very near, by the last Intelligence, and it is probable something serious may take Place. It is greatly fortunate that so much Ardor and Exertion now prevail in the Eastern States, especially Rhode-Island and Massachusetts. Vigorous Operations this Campaign are essential for the united States. Should the great imperial Courts of Europe determine upon reestablishing Peace, the Fate of America will be involved in their Determinations. The Claims of the united States will doubtless appear before them upon the \""ultima lex Regum.\"" To establish our Independence with them, we must possess the Country with Arms in our Hands, able to defend it. Should great Britain command the Civil Jurisdiction in any of the States, I know not of any Right that can be brought in Competition with their Claim. For other Nations cannot look into the Merits of our Separation, but judge in Chief from our actual Situation. Should we therefore be in Possession of internal Government, & the British Troops confined to Posts, the Merits of our Claims will appear irresistible, & we shall happily preclude the Necessity of continuing the War, when every Friend to his Country must wish for Peace.  General Cornell arrived Yesterday, & delivered your Excellency's Letter to Congress, the Contents of wch. will soon be acted upon, & Congress are disposed to treat them with the most honorable Regard.(3) I have not, as yet, heard from Mr Mowrey, neither have I obtained an official Information from the State since last April. The amazing Depreciation of the Paper Currency upon my Arrival here soon made it necessary to draw Support from my Family; but absolute Necessity obliged me, some Time since, to draw upon the General Treasurer of the State for two hundred & sixty six Dollars & two Thirds. The Anticipation of that Draft, by receiving the Money here, gave me some Relief, And I made the Sum as small as possible, expecting that the State must have ordered me a more adequate Supply. I addressed my Letter of Advice to Governor Bowen, as he lives upon the Spot. I hope the State will not continue long unrepresented. It is a very unfortunate Situation. The unremitted Attention that has been necessary during my Residence here, to a multiplicity of perplexing Business would render a Permission to return very agreable; but the will of the State and a Consciousness of preferring the public Good to every other Consideration, will make me happy in every possible Situation.  I have the Honor of being, with profound Respect, your Excellency's very obedient & most humble Servt. J M Varnum.  ""

  My dear Friend Philada. July 7th. 1781 I have received 2 copies of your favour of the 7th of Decr. last and 3 of that of the 30th of Novr. preceding. Having neglected to bring with me from Virginia the Cypher concerted between you & the Executive, I still remain ignorant of the paragraph in your last which I suppose the best worth knowing.(1) The State of our affairs has undergone so many vicisitudes since you embarked for Europe, (2) and I can so little judge how far you may have had intelligence of them, that I am at a loss where I ought to begin my narrative. As the present posture of them is the most interesting I shall aim at nothing further at present than to give you some idea of that, referring to past events so far only as may be necessary to explain it. JULY 7, 1781  The insuperable difficulties which opposed a general conquest of America seem as early as the year 1779 to have been felt by the enemy & to have led them into the scheme of directing their operations & views against the Southern States only. Clinton accordingly removed with the principal part of his force from N. York to S. Carolina & laid siege to Charlston which after an honorable resistance was compelled to surrender to a superiority of force. Our loss in men besides the inhabitants of the Town was not less than 2000. Clinton returned to N. York. Cornwallis was left with about 5000 troops to pursue his conquests. Genl Gates was appointed to the Command of the S. Department, in place of Lincoln who commanded in Charlston at the time of its capitulation. He met Cornwallis on the 16th of August 1780 near Campden in the upper part of S. Carolina & on the border of N. Carolina. A general action ensued in which the American troops were defeated with considerable loss, though not without making the enemy pay a good price for their victory. Cornwallis continued his progress into N. Carolina, but afterwards retreated to Campden. The defeat of Gates was followed by so general a clamor agst. him that it was judged expedient to recall him. Greene was sent to succeed in the command. About the time of his arrival at the army, Cornwallis having been reinforced from N. York resumed his enterprize into N Carolina. A detachment of his best troops was totally defeated by Morgan with an inferior number,(3) & consisting of a major part of Militia detached from Green's Army. 500 were made prisoners, between 2 or 300 killed & wounded, & abt. the like number escaped. This disaster instead of checking the ardor of Cornwallis, afforded a new incentive to a rapid advance in the hope of recovering his prisoners. The vigilance & activity however of Morgan secured them. Cornwallis continued his pursuit as far as the Dan River which divides N. Carolina from Virginia. Greene, whose inferior force obliged him to recede this far before the Enemy, recd. such succors of Militia on his entering Virga. that the chace was reversed. Cornwallis in his turn retreated precipitately. Green overtook him on his way to Wilmington, and attacked him.(4) Altho' the ground was lost on our side the British army was so much weakened by the loss [of] 5 or 600 of their best troops that their Retreat towds. Wilmington suffered little interruption. Green pursued as long as any chance of reaching his prey remained & then leaving Cornwallis on his left took an oblique direction towards Campden which with all the other posts in S. Carolina except Charleston & Ninety Six have in consequence fallen again into our possession. His army lay before the latter when we last heard from him. It contained 7 or 800 men & large quantities of Stores. It is nearly 200 miles from Charleston, & without some untoward accident can not fail of being taken. Green has detachments all over S. Carolina; Some of them within a little   distance of Charleston, and the resentments of the people against their late insolent masters ensure him all the aids they can give in restablishing the American Government there. Great progress is also making in the redemption of Georgia.  As soon as Cornwallis had refreshed his troops at Wilmington, abandoning his Southern Conquests to their fate, he pushed forward into Virginia. The Parricide Arnold had a detachment at Portsmouth when he lay on the Dan, Philips had reinforced him so powerfully from New York, that the junction of the two armies at Petersburg could not be prevented. The whole force amounted to about 6,000 men. The force under the Marquis de la fayette who commanded in Virginia, being greatly inferior, did not oppose them, but retreated into Orange & Culpeper in order to meet Genl Wayne who was on his way from Pennsylvania to join him. Cornwallis advanced Northward as far as Chesterfield in the County of Caroline, having parties at the same time at Pages Warehouse & other places in its vicinity. A party of Horse commanded by Tarlton was sent with all the secrecy & celerity possible to surprize & take the Genl Assembly & Executive who had retreated from Richmond to Charlottesville. The vigilance of a young Gentleman who discovered the design & rode express to Charlottesville prevented a complete suprize. As it was, several Delegates were caught, and the rest were within an hour of sharing the same fate. Among the captives was Col. Lyon of Hanover. Mr. Kinloch a Member of Congress from S. Carolina was also caught at Mr. John Walker's whose daughter he had married some time before. Governor Jefferson had a very narrow escape. The Members of the Government rendevouzed at Staunton, where they soon made a House. Mr. Jefferson's year having expired he declined a reelection & General Nelson has taken his place.(5) Tarlton's party retreated with as much celerity as it had advanced. On the junction of Wayne with the Marquis & the arrival of Militia the latter faced about and advanced rapidly on Cornwallis who retreated to Richmond & thence precipitately to Williamsburg, where he lay on the 27th Ultimo. The Marquis pursued & was at the same time with in 20 miles of that place. One of his advanced parties had had a successful skirmish within six miles of Williamsburg. Bellini (6) has I understand abided patiently in the College the dangers & inconveniences of such a situation. I do not hear that the consequences have condemned the experiment. Such is the present State of the War in the Southern Department. In the Northern the Operations have been for a considerable time in a manner suspended. At present a vigorous siege of New York by Gen Washington's army aided by 5 or 6000 french troops under Ct. de Rochambeau is in contemplation and will soon commence. As the English have the command of the water, the result of such an enterprize must be very uncertain. It is supposed however that it will certainly  oblige the Enemy to with draw their force from the S. States which may be a more convenient mode of relieving them than by marching the troops from N. York at this season of the year to the Southward. On the whole the probable conclusion of this Campaign is at this juncture very flattering, the Enemy being on the defensive in every quarter.  The vicisitudes which our finances have undergone are as great as those of the War. The depreciation of the old continental bills having arrived at 40, 50, & 60 for 1, Congress on the 18th of March 1780, resolved to displace them entirely from circulation, and substitute another currency to be issued on better funds & redeemable at a shorter period. For this purpose they fixed the relative value of paper & specie at 40 for 1 & directed the States to sink by taxes the whole 200 Millions in one year, and to provide proper funds for sinking in six years, a new currency which was not to exceed 10 Millions of Dollars, which was redeemable within that period & to bear an interest of 5 per Ct. payable in bills of exchange on Europe or hard money.(7) This scheme has not yet been carried into full execution. The old bills are still unredeemed in part, in some of the States where they have depreciated to 2, 3 & 400 for 1. The new bills, which were to be issued only as the old ones were taken in, are consequently in a great degree still unissued; and the depreciation which they have already suffered has determined Congress & the States to issue as few more of them as possible. We seem to have pursued our paper projects as far as prudence will warrant. Our medium in future will be principally Specie. The States are already levying taxes in it. As the paper disappears the hard money comes forward into circulation. This revolution will also be greatly facilitated by the influx of Spanish Dollars from the Havannah where the Spanish forces employed agst. the Floridas (8) consume immense quantities of our flour, and remit their dollars in payment. We also receive considerable assistance from the direct aids of our Ally & from the money expended among us by his auxiliary troops. These advantages as they have been & are likely to be improved by the skill of Mr. Robert Morris whom we have Constituted Minister of our Finances, afford a more flattering prospect in this department of our affairs, than has existed at any period of the War.  The great advantage the Enemy have over us lies in the superiority of their navy-which enables them continually to shift the war into defenceless places and to weary out our troops by long marches. The squadron sent by our ally to our support did not arrive till a reinforcement on the part of the Enemy had counteracted their views. They have been almost constantly blocked up at Rhode Island by the British fleet. The effects of a hurricane in the last Spring on the latter gave a temporary advantage to the former, but circumstances delayed the improvement of it, till the critical season was   past. Mr. Destouches who commanded the french fleet nevertheless hazarded an expedition into Chesapeak bay. The object of it was to co-operate with the Marquis de la fayette in an attack agst. Arnold who lay at Portsmouth with about 1500 British Troops. Had he got into the Bay & taken a favorable station the event would certainly have been adequate to our hopes. Unfortunately the British fleet, which followed the french immediately from Rhode Island, reached the capes of Virginia first, on the arrival of the latter a regular & fair combat took place. It lasted for several hours, and ended rather in favor of our Allies. As the Enemy however were nearest the capes, and one of the french Ships had lost her rudder & was otherwise much damaged, the Commander thought it best to relinquish his object & return to his former Station. The damage sustained by the Enemy according to their own representation, exceeded that of the french & as their number of Ships & weight of metal were both superior, it does great honor to the gallantry & good conduct of Mr. Destouches. Congress & indeed the public at large were so sensible of this that their particular thanks were given him on the occasion.(9) No description can give you an adequate idea of the barbarity with which the Enemy have conducted the war in the Southern States. Every outrage which humanity could suffer has been committed by them. Desolation rather than conquest seems to have been their object. They have acted more like desperate bands of Robbers or Buccaneers than like a nation making war for dominion. Negroes, Horses, Tobacco &c not the Standards & arms of their antagonists are the trophies which display their success. Rapes, murders & the whole catalouge of individual cruelties, not protection & the distribution of justice are the acts which characterize the share of their usurped Jurisdiction. The advantage we derive from such proceedings would, if it were purchased on other terms than the distresses of our Citizens, fully compensate for the injury occurring to the public. They are a daily lesson to the people of the U. States of the necessity of perseverance in the contest, and where ever the pressure of their local tyranny is removed the subjects of it, rise up as one man to avenge their wrongs and prevent a repetition of them. Those who have possessed a latent partiality for them as their resentments are embittered by their disappointments generally feel most sensibly their injuries & insults and are the foremost in retaliating them. It is much to be regretted that these things are so little known in Europe. Were they published to the World in their true colours, the British nation would be hated by all nations as much as they have heretofore been feared by any, and all nations would be sensible of the policy of abridging a power which nothing else can prevent the abuse of.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia, July 8th. 1781. Since you left us we have been going on nearly in the old tract, tho' the General Assemblies of this State, Delaware and Maryland, by their late exertions (being at last thoroughly roused) have granted such effectual Aids, as must enable us in a little time to hold up our heads again. The Army under General Green has been successful; Augusta in Georgia and all the enemies posts in that State, except Savanna, are certainly in our possession; and I believe Fort Ninety Six, and all other Posts of the enemy in South Carolina, except Charles-Town, are also wrested from them. There were an hundred barrels of powder, and a considerable quantity of other military Stores and provisions, found in Augusta, and about five hundred Prisoners taken there and in its neighbourhood. A general exchange of prisoners has taken place to the Southward, and our good old friend General Gadsden is expected here in a few days. All the JULY 8, 1781  Refugees and Tories taken on our part have been given up for all our Militia taken by the enemy; this was agreed to without any reference to numbers or rank on either side.  A new President of Congress is to be chosen tomorrow, as Mr. Huntington will not continue any longer; this honor is going a begging; there is only one Gentleman, and he from the Southward, who seems willing to accept, but I question whether he will be elected. (1) There are some amongst us, who are so fond of having a great and powerful man to look up to, that, tho' they may not like the name of King, seem anxious to confer kingly powers, under the titles of Dictator, Superintendant of Finance, or some such, but the majority do not yet appear to be so disposed.(2) The Harvests in Pennsylvania and the adjoining States promise to be double in quantity and better in quality than in any year during the last twenty, and the whole Country teems with fruit. In short that good Providence that has protected and blessed us hitherto, appears now to take us under his most particular care; for everything augurs well.  This will be handed to you by Mr. James Davidson, Rector of the Academy of Philadelphia, who goes to Boston for the purpose of getting possession of the personal estate of a deceased Brother-in Law, Mr. James Lynds, a Lieutenant in our Navy, and late Lieutenant of the Privateer Thorne, on board of which he was killed in Action. Mr. Davidson had an anxiety to be introduced to you, and I knew you would grant the indulgence. If he should stand in need of any assistance, respecting his affairs, I would be obliged to you to recommend proper persons to him.

The Courts of Law in the Common Wealth of Virginia being open, as well to the Citizens of other States, as to her own, the said Simon Nathan, as well as any other individual might have applied there, for Justice, and obtained it.(3) If his Demand, although just, were of such a Nature as to be out of the reach of the Courts of Law, still the Case would not be without Remedy; as on Petition to the Legislature, the Supreme Authority of the State, it would no doubt be attended to, and redressed.  Besides the Consequences above stated, it will occur to the Supreme Executive Council, that great Evils may ensue to the particular State, and to the Union in general, if Individual Claims be allowed to arrest the Military Supplies of one State imported into or passing through another in Time of War, and to withold them from her until released by the usual Courts of Law.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia July 10th. 1781 It is probable that you will either suppose that Congress are not disposed to do Justice, or that they are dilatory in their Motions, or JULY 10, 1781  that the Delegates of Massachusetts are inattentive to the very important Concerns of the State When such a Length of Time has elapsed & Information has not been given, whether any Thing is done, or is to be done, with Respect to the old Currency. It is possible that every one of the above Suppositions may in part be true. It was a Misfortune that I did not receive your Official Letter, Respecting the Money &ca before I left Boston. The Letter has been before a Comme. about Eight or Ten Days. A Report has been drawn up several Days-But the Person that draughted it was suddenly taken ill, & his Life has been almost dispaired of, for two or three Days. I was very desirous to have him present, he is sensible, & has considerable Influence, & appears to take up the Matter upon equitable Principles, with Respect to the old Money. As the Report now stands, every State is to be credited for all the old, they can procure, previous to the first of November next, at 75 for I. This will afford our State Relief with Respect to the Sum it may have, over & above the Requisition of Congress. Mr. Houston, of New Jersey, the Gentleman I have Reference to above, says, that he is surprised, that our State should hesitate, as to Congress's crediting them for any over plus Sum, that they should collect. But you are very sensible that we did hesitate. If it should pass as it now stands (I cannot be assured that it will) It will not reach you, so that the Genl Court can act upon it before September; as I suppose they will adjourn to that Month. Then you will have but about seven or Eight Weeks to lay your Plan to procure it, & to have it collected. I have no doubt but that there are large Quantities of the old Currency in Massachusetts; but I do not apprehend that their greatest sufferings will arise from that-But upon the Difference of the Value of the new Money, as it has been emitted from the several Loan Offices. I dont understand that Pennsylvania have emitted a single Dollar of their 6/lo; & of the 4/10 they have issued but about 174,000 Dollrs.; & have peremptorily forbid any more of the 4/10 to be emitted. They have empowered Mr. Morris to procure other States new Money to answer the Demands of Congress for the 4/10. This is a Stroke of Policy, that I believe Massachusetts would not have tho't of. What is the Debt of Pensyla. in Consequence of the Resolve of Congress of the 18th of March? 174,000 Dollrs. @ 5 for 1 is 34,800 Dolls Specie-& if they furnish the Remainder of the 4/lO @ 5 for 1 It will amount to no more than 84,800 Dollrs. Specie & no accumulating Interest. The aggregate Sum is 119,600 Dollrs. Specie. Massachusetts I conclude has before this Time furnished the whole of the 4/10 @ about 2 for 1 which will make in Specie 299,000 Dollrs. Thus notwithstanding the Taxes on each are equal the united States will realize from Massachustts. 179,400 Specie Dollrs. more than from Penna. It is publicly avowed that Congress cannot, that they have not the Power to draw Bills of Exchange to discharge the Interest of any of the new Money & it will   not be paid as the face of the Bill Specifies. It is hard telling you so-But so it will be-for, all the old Members say it cannot be otherwise. This I am truly sensible will be attended with the most dange[rous] Consequences to our State. Congress being as well ascertained of this Fact 6 Months ago as they now are, from what I can learn; I think the State should have been seasonably informed, so as that they might have governed themselves accordingly-But on this I need make no Observations. I do not from the short Time I have been here, discover but one great Difficulty subsisting-which is indeed very great. That is the Want of Money-And this Want never could have subsisted to the Degree it now does; If it had not been for a fluctuating Paper Medium. It is not altogether a Loss of public Credit, it is in Part owing to Speculation-may there not be the Principle of Speculation in public Bodies as well as among Individuals. And if 598,000 Dollrs. Specie can be discharged with 119,000-it is no small saving. I think the saving does not tend to the Salvation of the Country But it is easy to conceive that, while one State pays 1/5 of what is required another half, & others none at all, our Poverty must be great. To do Justice to Massachusetts I think that all the Money that have been received of her to the use of the united States ought to be compared with hard Money in the State & we ought to have Credit for its real Value; & every other State ought to be treated in the same Way, hard Money must be the Standard.  As I find myself, so I doubt not you will be thoro[l]y tired of the Subject by this Time-I must therefore take Leave to subscribe myself with every Sentiment of Esteem, your most humble Servant, Samuel Osgood  P. S. I can pretty easily discover an uneasiness that Massachusetts has not pass'd an Act giving to Congress five per Ct. on imported Articles-will Massachusetts do it? I have gently hinted that I thot they would not. I find that the Superintendant of Finance is much in Favor of it-& he will be disappointed if it does not take Place. Foreign Loans, says he, cannot be procured unless there is some more certain Fund than that of annual Taxation, to discharge the Interest.  I fear Difficulty will arise about the pay of the Massachusetts Line of the Army. The paymaster Genl. had a Warrant on the Loan Officer of Massachusetts for nearly 300,000 Dollrs. some time ago, for the purpose of paying sd. Line. Without it is attended to, will they not draw double pay? Mr. Appleton can tell whether he has furnished the Money for that Purpose.  ""

I scarcely Dare trust my Thoughts on paper but be assured Sir that the Policy of Vermont has Induced them to make Enormous grants to men of Influence in Several States & Even to members of Congress.(2) Mr Livermore & myself no doubt will Concur in the proper plan to avoid the Danger arising from this & other Quarters. The only \""Plausible argument\"" in favor of Determining the Question of Independence is That this is not Simply a Dispute between New York & New Hampshire but  JULY 10, 1781  between them & a people claiming to be Independent of both. The answer to this is Simple & plain viz that New Hampshire & New York both by ancient & modern determinations join upon Each other. Of Course no Independent State can possibly Exist between them & their claim of Independence can no more operate to alter the mode of tryal pointed out in the confederation than if Massachusets & New Hampshire both Laid Claim to the County of Essex & the Inhabitants were to Declare themselves Independent of both. Here the first Steps should be to Settle the Dispute between the States & if it was Determined to Appertain to Massa. no other Question would be necessary. Besides if we admit for a moment the possibily of its being Independent we declare it out of the union & oust ourselves of any Jurisdiction, as we have nothing to do with more than thirteen States a fourteenth would have a right to Deny the Jurisdiction of Congress which it Seems Vermont has already done. The Safest ground therefore for New Hampshire is to Trust that as there is no intermediate Spot between New York & New Hampshire & That as Congress have Included Vermont within the Limits of the Thirteen united States it must belong to Some one of them and Therefore Congress ought to Determine to which agreable to the rules Laid Down in the Confederation.  I confess myself astonished at the proceedings of Vermont & more so at the Conduct of the Inhabitants in our Counties. I am unwilling to believe them Influenced by the British, but a variety of Circumstances have almost Confirmed me in this opinion. I Suppose whatever can be done here will be done in a week or fortnight at farthest. The Commissioners will no Doubt meet at Springfield or Hartford where the titles will be Discussed & the Right Determined. Of Course my attendance here will be no Longer necessary on that account. I wish therefore that Mr Gilman may be directed to Set out to relieve me immediately as my Domestic concerns will oblidge me to Set out perhaps before his arrival. Should the State call on me to argue the Cause before the Commissioners I shall attend with pleasure. I have the honor to be with the most perfect Esteem Dear Sir your most obedt. Servt.

  Philada 11 July 1781. A 20-page survey of the southern campaign recounting Lord Cornwallis' peregrinations from the Battle of Camden, August 16, 1780, to his encampment at Willimsburg in late  JULY 11, 1781  June 1781.(1) \""Lord Cornwallis by his travels through the Southern States must have gained some knowledge of the disposition of the Americans and what little foundation there is for those idle reports and surmises with which the nation of Great Britain has been so long amused and deceived, that the bulk of the people were in favour of Britain and that the opposition and the war is upheld and supported by a faction: In his long marches from Charles town to Camden, from Camden to Dan, from Dan through the whole extent of Carolina to Wilmington, from Wilmington to Richmond and from Richmond to the foot of the blue ridge and thence down again to Williamsburg and the sea coast, a route of upwards of eleven hundred miles, what accession of force did he gain? What supplies or assistance did he receive except from those immediately in his power and who was under the terror of his army? Who was it but the armed yeomanry of the Country that opposed his march and so often forced him to measure back his steps with such speed? And yet at this time the people were in a great degree in a state of nature, being free from all restraints of government. In South Carolina a civil government was wholly suspended, North Carolina was in such confusion and tumult by the sudden invasion, that government had no time to exert itself and the people were left to act from the immediate impulses of their own minds. The case was the same in Virginia when the Assembly retired from Richmond to Charlotteville and from thence across the mountain to Augusta. And yet as fast as the people could arm themselves they repaired to the continental standard and joining the few continental troops in the field voluntarily and bravely exposed their lives in defence of their rights and liberties and could a sufficient number of arms have been procured and put into the hands of the volunteer militia, his lordship would have sooner been convinced to his Cost of the rediculous absurdity of such assertions.  \""There is another instance which ought not to be omitted and which demonstrates in the clearest manner what a deed rooted and national hatred of Britain possesses the minds of the people. I mentioned in my last the great embarrassments of our finances. During the time of those great exertions already mentioned the public treasury was in a manner empty, The Army unpaid and ill supplied with provisions and in a manner naked for want of cloaths. When the troops under Genl Washington were separated and sent into their winter cantonments, some british deserters that had been inlisted in the Pensylvania line took advantage of the uneasiness occasioned for want of money, cloaths and provisions and some complaints among those troops on account of the terms of enlistment and incited them to a mutiny and open revolt. The news of this revolt quickly reached New York and Clinton from a fond hope of turning it to his advantage immediately dispatched two emissaries to   the mutineers with large offers of reward if they would come over to him, and even proceeded so far as to march with a body of troops to the west end of Staten Island with a view to facilitate a junction with him if they accepted his offer or to support them in case they should be attacked by the troops of the other States. But so deep rooted was their aversion to the british that they immediately seized his emissaries and kept them closely confined declaring at the same time that though they were driven by wrongs and distresses to the present measures they looked for redress from no other quarter than from the State to which they belonged and that in case Clinton advanced to take advantage of their seeming defection from the cause they would instantly put themselves under the command of their officers and convince him that their attachment to the cause was the same it ever was. And to give farther force to their declarations they advanced from Princetown to Trenton and delivered up the emissaries who were executed as spies.  \""I should now give you some account of our internal affairs but I imagine you are pretty well tired with this minute detail of military transactions and know you will receive from others whose duty it is information on some arrangements late taken I shall therefore spare you.  \""Enclosed is an official letter from the Secretary of Congress informing you that Mr Huntington having on account of his ill state of health been obliged to apply for leave of absence and to quit the chair, Congress proceeded to the election of another President and their choice has fallen on Mr McKean.(2) \""You have also a cypher (3) which you may use either in your public dispatches or with your friend the Secretary who presents his most respectful compliments to Mrs Jay and begs your acceptance of the same.\""(4) ""

  Sir Philadelphia July 12th 1781 We were honored with your Excellency's Letter of the 18th of last month, and are well pleased with the measures taken by the Hon. General Assembly, therein mentioned. It is the wish of Congress, as well as of the people in general this way, to get rid of paper currency, it greatly Embarasses our affairs; it is but little used here in any trade or dealing, and not at all, in the Market; the prices of many articles of country produce are near as low for hard money [as] they were before the war. The new continental and State Bills are not better than five for one Specie. The issuing them at that rate, if they are to be redeemed at par must be a very great loss to the public. We are glad that the State we have the honor to represent, has determined to issue No More Bills of Credit, and that those Now outstanding are likely to be Soon redeemed in a way that will do justice to the possessors, and the public.  Mr. Robert Morris has lately entered on the execution of the office of Superintendant of the Finances, and Congress have Ordered that he be furnished with Copies of the requisi[ti]ons made to the Several States for monies and other Supplies and have put them under his direction with the advice of the Commander in Chief of the Army. Much good is expected from his abilities, and we wish the expectations of the public may be fully answered. No Journals of Congress have been printed Since December, for want of money to pay the expence. JULY 12, 1781  The regulation of the clothing department has been lately altered, and the Several States excused from procuring any account of the united States after the first day of September next. We opposed the Measure, being of the opinion that the Army will Suffer for want of clothing if not Supplied by the particular States, also that many articles of clothing can be provided by the people, easier than they can raise hard money to purchase them.  We have the satisfaction to find that General Washington, has the Same apprehensions with us as to the first particular which will probably induce Congress to reconsider it.(1) The State of Massachusetts has applied to Congress for justice with respect to the old continental Bills in that State whose currency is Now at an end, the matter is under the consideration of a Committee.(2) Col. Hazen is promoted, to the rank of Brigadier by Brevet.  It is expected that the Emperor of Germany and the Empress of Russia will interpose their Mediation for a general pacification among the Bellegerent Powers. A vigorous exertion on our part this Campaign may put us in a good Situation for a honorable Peace. The British forces in America are waxing weaker & weaker, and ours Stronger & Stronger. 'Tis probable that in Carolina & Georgia the Enemy are confined to Charlestown & Savannah, though we have not had certain intelligence that our forces have taken the posts at Ninety Six and Augusta, but believe it is probable.  By the best accounts from Virginia the Marquis De la Fayette has a force Superior to Cornwallis's and that the latter is retiring toward Williamsburgh.  The Vessel that Col. Palfrey Sailed in for France, is Supposed to be lost, and Congress have appointed a Mr. Barclay of this City, Vice Consul to reside at France in Case Mr Palfrey does not arrive.(3) They have also appointed a Mr. Smith of Baltimore Agent for the States at the Havannah who is now there 'tis Supposed.(4) Such an agent may be very Serviceable to our people who trade there, much hard Cash has been lately brought from thence to this City in a way of trade.  By a Letter from Mr. Jay dated the beginning of March he mentions that he has obtained a loan in Spain of 150,000 dollars.(5) We have no official accounts of any obtained by Mr Adams in Holland, tho' the news papers mention that he has obtained one for a considerable Sum.  There never was a more fruitful Season known here than the present; the weather has been very favourable both for growth, and ingathering. Notwithstanding the Calamities that we Suffer, we are not left without Witness of the Divine Goodness.  We are with the greatest Respect, Your Excellency's Most Obedient, humble Servants,  Roger Sherman  Olivr. Ellsworth  ""

  Ma'am July 13. 1781 I have already acknowledged the Receipt of yr. Favor of June 10th. Severely as it concluded in Regard to my Reputation I did not arraign its Justice, but wrote an ingenuous Confession, similar to one I had made by the Opportunity of Genl. Ward.(1) I thought your Conclusion was founded upon a natural Construction of what you had been reading (S). (2) I venerated the Purity of your Sentiments. I was persuaded that no unkind Suspicions guided your Pen. But your Letter of the 23d of that month wears a different Complexion from the former. My Fall, Ma'am was not from a Horse, but still it was an \""honest\"" one. I had been engaged in the most benevolent Way at my Pen for Hours that Evening, witness, among others my Letters to Mr. Thos. Russel & Mr. Nathl. Barber April 24th.(3) I was forced out, in the Rain, to procure Money for a Person who wanted it much against the Dawn of next Morning. I found when abroad that I had misguided a Stranger as to the Lodging of the Gentleman from whom I was to receive the Money. I meant to rectify that Error by taking the Stranger with me. I suddenly crossed the Street where I was, at right Angle, and looking up under my flopped Hatt saw a Vacancy immediately before me, which I took to be an Alley I had often gone through; but I found that a Shop had been drawn away and a Cellar 10 feet deep had been dug to receive me. The Consequences were nearly mortal. I had delivered my Letters at the Office. The giving of early Intelligence to Mr. R of the miserable State of his captive Unkle was honest Employment. The Endeavor to prevent an abrupt Notice to Mr. B of the Death of an amiable Son was equally honest. The Seeking of money for one of my Creditors who was then in want of Cash, and the putting of a Stranger into the right Way were both of them honest Works. But, as the Honesty of my Pursuits was no Security against a Fall, neither has it been a Preventive against false Constructions of that Destiny. Michael Morgan Obrian, most naturally indeed, concluded that I had staggered sideways drunken into the Dock. Some, as naturally, and One against Nature have supposed I fell dishonestly down a Pair of dark Stairs. I have Hopes of being intirely free from Lameness in the Course of the Summer; and I am sure that Portia will rejoice at such an Event as my walking rightly for the Rest of my Life.  Give my Compliments to yr. amorous Friend Cornelia. I hope her Husband never leaves her for a Night. I presume she holds the general Opinion that Friendship may be even encreased by Seperation of the Parties; tho, differently from some of Us, she thinks bodily Presence essential to Love. She may be assured that there is that mixture of Friendship & Love in the Affection which unites Mrs. L & Me that Presence does not burn up the former, nor Absence congeal the latter JULY 13, 1781  I send you an Extract that will prove the confidential Sincerity of my former Letters to you. I would not wish that any other should see it. The Friends she alludes to are perhaps now my Enemies. I sacrifice to my Value for your Good Opinion.  Yes, I am \""Portia's affectionate Friend,\"" and I did not \""mean to retaliate for the Pain she had given me.\"" I \""could\"" not, I \""would\"" not. Led astray by Cornelia's Fancy, your Mind had taken a \""dark\"" Turn, and you found dreadful Things in an innocent Phraise \""on this subject.\"" Why, Ma'am, in my Thoughts the Subject simply was ABSENCE; and compoundly long Absence, but in yours it was a BREACH OF THE COMMANDMENTS and WHAT NOT.  I have no Copy of any Letter to you but I imagine I was not very unconnected or enigmatical. If you had ventured to converse with Mr. S[amuel] A[dams] you would have found that your All is not servile enough to gain the unbounded Affection of the foreign Court at which he resided when he had the Correspondence which produced the two Resolves of Congress already communicated to you. You would have found that {Gravier}(4) wrote two Letters in a Pet against Mr. A to {old Fkln} and that the latter had also written a most unkind & stabbing one hither; which he was under no necessity of doing, as he needed only to have transmitted the Papers given to him, for the Purpose, by the former.(5) This Knowledge would have prepared you for my last Letter in Cyphers;(6) and for the Information that Mr. A has now {no dtstinct powers.} I shall write minutely in Cyphers \""on this Subject\"" to S.A.(7) and you must have it at 2d. hand. I will only say for your Satisfaction that I cannot accuse any one or more of any want of Esteem for Mr. A, but I see him indelicatley handled by Means of wrong measures on a general Scale.  That I may be more at Leisure to be attentive only to senatorial Subjects, I will now close the former by telling you that Mrs. L added in her Letter \""I think, however, you will be obliged to come & show yourself this Fall.\"" This you will find is enough, tho it is not founded in her Wishes but in her Fears. The enevitable ill Consequences which I have proved to you, and the almost enevitable ones which I was afraid to name to you or to your Husband, who glories in what I should be sorry for, will not deter me from obeying this Half-Call, which is what I have never had before since I quitted Home. I add also-That the Expression, which I wish had never seen Light, was in Fact the Fruit of a Desire to pass a Compliment upon the Figure and Portrait which Mr. G[erry] had drawn in his Letter, it was indiscretely worded and was very liable to the worst Interpretation by any one whose Mind was in the least measure predisposed to make it. What is the most decent Day Labour you can think of for me while I am there?   I do not find opportunity to send yr. Boxes. I wish you would keep a good Account of what I sent: for really I cannot tell. I think I wrote you exactly at the Time of sending. Mr. Moylan perhaps will give an Invoice some Time or other. J. P. Jones is on the Road and will see you.  ""

The Instructions transmitted to the trustees of rebel Estates in Carolina appear to be very proper and applicable to the case of the british Creditors and those to whom I have communicated them express themselves well satisfied with them.\""  From the same to Sir Henry Clinton Feby. 7th. 1781 \""It gives his majesty particular satisfaction to find you had determined to replace Major Genl. Leslies detachment in Elizabeth river by one under Brigd. Genl. Arnold with positive orders to establish a permanent post there. I learn with great pleasure from private letters of the 22d December that you were preparing a very considerable Body of troops for immediate embarkation, which I flatter myself, from an expression in one of your letters to Vice Admiral Arbuthnot, will be employed in conjunction with the loyal Associators of Maryland and Pensylvania, in reducing those provinces to the King's obedience, while Lord Cornwallis and Brigadier Gen. Arnold subdue Virginia; for such is beyond all doubt the low condition of the Congress authority and finances and so weak the state of Washingtons army that little opposition is to be expected in that quarter and none that can resist such a force as without the least hazard to New York or Charlestown may be assembled there. You were perfectly right in your interpretation of the Vice Admirals orders for detaching five ships to the West Indies and I was happy to find he acquiesced in your Judgment upon that occasion.  \""The return of the people of Vermont to their allegiance is an event of the Utmost importance to the Kings Affairs and at this time if the French and Washington really meditate an irruption into Canada may be considered as opposing an insurmountable bar to the attempt. Genl. Haldiman who had the same Instructions with you to draw over those people and give them support will I doubt not push up a body of troops to act in conjunction with them to secure all the avenues thro' their Country into Canada and when the season admits take possession of the upper parts of the Hudson's and Connecticuts rivers and cutt of the communication between Albany and the Mohawk country how far they may be able to extend themselves to the southward and eastward must depend upon their number and the disposition of the Inhabitants but if Albany should take part with them by the Hudson's river will appear irresistable to people here. I am sorry I cannot inform you that the transports with the recruits are sailed from Cork, where the three regiments are in readiness to join them but a long continuance of easterly winds first prevented the ships getting round to Portsmouth and now the westerly winds detain them there but they are all at Spithead with their convoy ready to put to sea the moment the wind will permit them to sail. The ordnance store ship which has 5000 stand of Arms on board for Carolina being still in the river I have ordered 3000  stand to be sent by land carriage to Portsmouth and there distributed on board the Transports as I understand they are much wanted for arming the Loyalists. They are addressed to the commander of the forces in South Carolina.\""  From Lord George Germaine to Sir H. Clinton dated White Hall 7 March 1781  \""Sir \""Since my letter to you of the 7th of Feby. I have received your dispatches numbered four 113 to 117 inclusive, and laid them before the King.  \""The revolt of the Pensylvania line and Jersey brigade tho' not attended with all the good consequences that might have been expected, are certainly events of very great importance and must have very extensive effects both in reducing Washington's present force, and preventing its being recruited by new levies, and as I doubt not you will avail yourself of his weakness and your own great superiority to send a considerable force to the head of the Chesepeak, as soon as the season will permit operations to be carried on in that quarter, I flatter myself the southern provinces will be recovered to his Majesty's obedience before the long promised succours, none of which are yet sailed, can arrive from France, And Mr. Washington unable to draw subsistence for his troops from the west side of Hudsons river, be compelled to cross it and take refuge in the eastern provinces. I am very anxious to hear of Lord Cornwallis's progress since Genl. Leslie joined him, I have no doubt his movements will be rapid and decisive, for his Lordship appears to be fully impressed with the absolute necessity of vigorous exertions in the service of this Country in its present circumstances, the success of Genl. Arnold's enterprize up James River which the rebel newspaper's confirm, must greatly facilitate his Lordship's operations by cutting off Green's supplies; and obliging the militia to return to take care of their own property, Indeed so very contemptible is the rebel force now in all parts and so vast is our superiority every where that no resistance on their part is to be apprehended that can materially obstruct the progress of the King's Arms in the speedy suppression of the rebellion, and it is as pleasing tho' at the same time a mortifying reflection when the duration of the rebellion is considered which arises from a view of the returns of the Provincial forces you have transmitted, that the american Levies in the Kings services are more in number than the whole of the inlisted troops in the service of the Congress.  \""I am very glad to find you have commissioned a board of Directors of the refugees and I hope the Admiral will have been able to spare them shipping to carry on their operations on the sea coast of the New England provinces, many of those within the lines who are unfit for military service are desirous of being settled in the   Country about Penobscot, and require only to be supplied with Provisions for the first year, some tools for husbandry and Iron work for their buildings, and as it is proposed to settle that Country, and this appears a cheap method of disposing of these Loyalists it is wished you would encourage them to go there under the protection of the associated refugees and assure them that a Civil Government will follow them in due time for I hope in the course of the summer the Admiral and you will be able to share a force sufficient to effect an establishment at Casco Bay and reduce that country to the kings obedience.  \""I am very glad to find by the list of the Officers released that the exchanges have been carried so far but as it appears from Mr. Washingtons last letter to you that they will not be carried on further; the measure of enlisting their prisoners for services in the West Indies should be adopted immediately and indeed such has been the mortality from sickness among the troops there, that I do not see any other means of recruiting them.  \""I am sorry to acquaint that the general prevalence of westerly winds for these last two months has prevented the Warwick and Solebay with their Convoy from getting further than Plymouth, where they are still detained.\"" (2)  It further appears from these letters, that Arnold has received Bills of Exchange for five thousand pounds sterling on London, which have been paid and the money invested in the Stocks. This was probably the certain reward of his treasons, the rest may have been eventual.(3)  Congress are possessed of the originals from which the foregoing extracts are taken.  I am, Sir, with the utmost regard, Your Excellency's most obedient humble servant, Tho M:Kean President (4) ""

  Dr Sir, Philadelphia July 17. 1781 I wish I could by this post give you any authentic Information of our Affairs to the south, but Congress have received no Letters from either commanding Officers in that Department for many days. Reports from thence pass through Maryland, and these Approach nearer to truth in proportion to their Vicinity to the Scene of Operations. Those are the only Source of this days Intelligence. Congress have had before them a number of Official Letters from the Ministry in Brittain to their Commander in Chief, and other Heads of Departments in America, these were intercepted in a packet taken in Europe and transmitted by Mr. Jay.(1) From the Letters of Lord Germaine to Sir Henry Clinton &ca. it appears that the Expectation of a speedy Conquest was fully impressed on the Brittish Cabinet, and that administartion already regretted their proffered Clemency through their Commissioners held out in their proclamations. He observes to General Clinton and the other Commissioners that their Offers of pardon were not suffciently guarded with Exceptions, and that the Supplicants for pardon being readmitted to a full Enjoyment of the Rights exercised under their former Connection was more than Government ever intended to grant. Or in other Words that they meant to deprive them of their Charters and constitute their Governments more to the Will of the Parliament. He expresses much Satisfaction at the General's Information that there were more provincials in his Majestys Service in America than that of the United States, but laments the mortifying reflection that under those Circumstances the Rebellion should have continued so long. His Lordship apprehends General Clinton's Generosity in recommending so many of the provincial Choirs [Corps] to be put upon the Brittish Establishment and then secure of Victory, gives such a Construction to his Majestys directions on that Subject as to restrict the Benefits of it to very few.  These Instances serve to shew, if it remained to be proved, what would be the treatment of the friends to America in it, if his, Germaine's imaginary Ideas of Success were to be realised. No sooner had they any foundation for such a Hope, than they begin [...] to estimate the Value, and regret the Loss of Estates secured under former Submissions; and wish to discharge from their Service without the Rewards held out formerly, those whom they have seduced to be instrumental in accomplishing their supposed Con- JULY 17, 1781  quests. Lord Germaine speaks of the Carolinas & Georgia as totally reduced, and has no doubt but that Virginia must immediately yield to the Activity & Enterprise of Lord Cornwallis supported by so powerful an Army. His Lordship speaks of an Expedition which had been projected against our Bay, approves of it and urges General Clinton to push it with Vigour. It was intended to send a Number of Troops to the head of our Bay to act against Maryland and Pensylvania, and establish a place of Security for the Reception of the loyal Subjects in those States. The reverse of Fortune to the southward hath probably delayed the Execution of this place, and I hope the Event of the Operations there and elsewhere will oblige the Enemy totally to abandon it. It appears from Germain's Letters that they intended to fix a permanent post at Elizabeth River. Those Letters come down to the 7th March.  The Length of this Letter will apologize for my Silence last Week, and for my sending it in its present State. A necessary Attendance on the Courts will oblige me to return on the first of next month (2) by which time I expect to see Mr. Hanson here. I now intend to return on the first of September and remain here until November, if before I leave the City I see any well founded probability of receiving public Supplies. The Situation of many of the Delegates here is truly disagreeable, my Stay hath not been so long as to subject me to many difficulties yet, although I in some degree depended on public funds. The Necessity of being obliged to have Recourse to our friends has been the Lot of us all and it is unnecessary to comment on so humiliating a State. Present my respectful Compliments to Mrs Lee and believe me very sincerely, Yours affely. R. Potts  [P.S.] The State Agent hath just informed us that Tobacco is near at Hand for our relief. The Reduction of the Post at Augusta is this Moment officially announced to Congress (3)-have not time to transmit particulars. Nothing official from 96.  ""

  Dear Sir Philadelphia July 17th 1781 I am honored with your favor of the 3d Instant and shall pay particular attention to its Contents; the affair of Vermont is now before Congress and I flatter myself proper measures will be adopted to punish the Defection of the Towns East of Connecticut River: and also the unwarrantable usurpations of Vermont. I think Congress will fix a Day for determining the Claims of N. Hamps and New York.(1) I Thank you for the Intelligence respecting the Spy. I believe that by That or some other Channel you will soon discover that The Leading men in Vermont if not a great majority of the Inhabitants are in the British Interest.  I sincerely wish Mr Morris had hard Cash Sufficient to pursue the Plan you propose but he has not Enough for that and for carrying on the present Campaign, which Last must be preferred to Every other Consideration.  As to the proposed Congress of vienna we have every thing to hope but nothing to fear from that Quarter. Russia has already fixed two preliminary Articles viz an absolute Recognition of the Independance of America: And the Restoration of Dutch property by the Court of London. all the powers of Europe Except the Emperor of Germany will from principles of policy Endeavor to Separate forever Great Britain and America-The Emperors Interest on the Contrary urges him to Augment the power of Britain as his only Security against the growing power of France. The King of Prussia is bound by Every principle of policy to Increase the power of france in order to Diminish that of the Emperor. This being the Case Either a peace will take place agreeable to our wishes or the Congress will break up without any thing more being Effected than a Determination of the Emperor to Espouse the Cause of Britain and that of the Empress to oppose it. This cannot Effect America but in the most advantageous manner, for the force of Germany added to that of Britain when opposed by Russia will not be so Dangerous to America as that of the Catawba Indians. it has no Naval force & when that of Russia is added to that of France Spain & Holland the Superiority will be so Decisive that all attempts against America will either Cease or prove fruitless. the Land forces of Germany if put in motion will be immediately opposed by Prussia & Should a part of that of france and Spain become necessary this will not diminish That Naval Superiority which will Serve Effectually to Bafffle their attempts against the united States.  I shall mention you to Mr Morris and Inform you orally of his reply. I Say orally because I mean to Leave this place in a few weeks. Mr Livermore Sends his Compliments. JULY 17, 1781  Reprinted from Sullivan, Papers (Hammond), 3:336-38, \""From original in possession of Prof. Barrett Wendell, Portsmouth, N.H.\""  1 Robert R. Livingston, who was in Philadelphia though not as a delegate to Congress, forcefully stated a New York perspective of the Vermont proceedings in Congress at this time in the following July 18 letter to governor George Clinton.  \""I arrived here yesterday and found Congress fully engaged in the business of the grants in consequence of a remonstrance from New Hampshire. A Committee was appointed and a report drawn up upon principles very repugnant to our interests. I have got some alterations made, it is still far from being unexceptionable, And have solicited the members not to proceed till our delegates arrive. Your excellency will see the necessity of expediting them as much as possible. The business may otherwise be entered upon without them when this and other considerations press for a full representation from our state. The enclosed extract of a Letter from Lord George Germain to Sir Henry puts their connection with Great Britain out of doubt and renders our situation truly alarming. I would beg leave to suggest to your Excellency the expedientcy of confering with the Genl. (who has certified copies of the Letter) on the subject And however inconvenient it may be to you I think the Legislature should be convened immediately for the appointment of Delegates and the consideration of this business. It is true that Congress have not given nor will as far as I can learn will give (tho' I have endeavoured to bring it about) you any official information on this subject, yet as you already know it, and can learn it more authentically from the Genl. you would not be justified if any unfortunate consequence should arise from neglecting it. I shall have the honor of conversing with you more at large on this subject when I have the honor of seeing you at Poughkeepsie which I hope to be in the course of the next week as I shall leave this as soon as our delegates arrive who[se] places I am endeavouring as far as lays in my power to supply tho' very lamely as you may easily conceive.\"" Burnett, Letters, 6:148n.

  Dear Colo. Philadelphia July 19th. 1781 We have this morning recieved dispatches from the Marquis containing the particulars of Genl. Waynes action of the 6th and am happy to find it was not more bloody on our side. It would appear from the conduct of the enemy that they did not want to see any more of the Marquis's and Genl. Waynes flourishes for the present. Is it not probable that they mean to evacuate Virginia and go to New York.  We have also recieved letters this morning from Genl. Greene (1) giving an account of the approach of Rawden by which after storming the enemys works at ninety six he was obliged to raise the siege, when in all probability a few days more leisure would have put him in possession of that important post. As I presume you have heard all the particulars, I shall not enter into detail.  A few days ago two of the french frigates took a large gaurd ship mounting 32 guns and two small vessels from the enemy in the bay near Hellgate.  I am not a little surprised at the inattention of Don Galvez in the capitulation which he entered into with the enemy at Pensacola. It is contained in one of the inclosed papers to which I beg leave to refer you.(2) As we are not yet the Allies of Spain and the french under  JULY 21, 1781  Genl. Washington being auxiliary troops and as the prisoners have partly arrived and are all expected at New York they will evade the true intent and meaning of the capitulation and will in all probability arm against us-this will be a reinforcement to the enemy of near one thousand men. We are not particularly informed what approaches the comr. in chief is making towards New York.  Genl. Greene and the Marquis, and their armies deserve the highest praise.  Neither Mrs. Febiger nor myself have been so happy as to recieve a line from you since we wrote you last.  With great esteem, I am my dear Colo., Your Most Obt. Humble Servt. Wm. Sharpe  P.S.

  My dear Sir, Pha July 23d. 1781. I have applyed to Mr. Morris to take your Brother under his protection. The Mercantile Houses in which he is concerned are full, but he has agreed to take him into his Office of Financier. He says he cannot mention any terms at present, these will be taken into consideration when he is acquainted with your Brothers Merits. I think that Mr. Morris will be the means of making his fortune therefore the sooner he gets to this place the better.(1)  The last accounts from General Green, were, that he was obliged to raise the Seige of 96 but expected to come to some action with Lord Rawdon. General Moutrie who left Chas. Town about the 8th Inst informs, that it was reported that Ld Rawdon had retreated to Orangeburg 80 Miles from Chas. Town, & that General Green had reinvested 96.  The last information from the Marquis Mentions an Action between a part of our Troops & Cornwallis near Williamsburg,(2) the consequence of wch was that Cornwallis had Crossed Jas. River; and it is generally conjectured at this place that he intends to Portsmouth, & from thence part of his Troops will reinforce New York and the other part (after Portsmouth is Garrison'd) will go to Charles Town. We lost in Killed, wounded & missing about 140, many of Our officers wounded but none of them killed. A Lieut. Coll. of the Jersey Line taken. The Enemy, the Marquis says lost many men but had been at great pains to conceal their Dead, I am afraid that our execution in this engagement was not great.  What hand General Washington will make of New York-God knows. I confess that my expectations are but small. It is said Two British Men of War & seven Transports are gone up North River-if JULY 23, 1781  this be true, it is probable it is a Manoeuvre against Westpoint to draw back the Genl. The Delegates are still distressed for Money. I wish you had Sent me 20 or thirty pounds Specie by the Alderman tho' God knows when I could have repayed it. Mr. Clagget informs me that there will be great canvassing for the Electors to Elect the Senate, and that the people seem alarm'd by attempts lately made to lessen the reputation of the present Members. I wish the Same Spirit may prevail throughout the Counties. I make not the least doubt that S.C.(3) (who it is probable will be the Elector for Annaps.) will do every thing in his power to get as many of his friends in as possible, and therefore every friend to the Constitution ought to do every thing in his power to circumvent him.  We have had no late accounts from Europe.  Attempts have been made by Genls Clinton & Haldimand to seduce the people of Vermont & if we do not speedily allow them to be independant I fear they will join the Enemy. This business is to be taken up to day but as New York is not represented I suppose it will be postponed. With my Compliments to Mrs. Stone & your family.

The last information from the Marquis, mentions an Action between part of our Troops & Cornwallis near Wmsburg and that in consequence thereof his Lordship had crossed James River, and generally conjectured here that he intended to Portsmouth, & from thence to N York & Chas Town, but I this moment am told that RH Lee has wrote to some Gentln. in this place, that he was on his March to the Carolinas. I wish this may be true, for he must lose great part of his Army in accomplishing of it at this Season of the year. We lost in the action near Wmsburg in killed, wounded & missing about 140 men, many officers wounded but none killed; a Lieut. Coll of the Jerseys taken prisoner. The Marquis says that the British lost many more but had taken great pains to conceal their dead. I fear as the dead were carried off, that we did not do great execution. What progress Genl Washington will make against New York God only knows. I confess that my expectations are but small. It is said that two British Ships of the Line, & Seven Transports are gone up North River, if this be true it is done to draw Genl Washing towards West point. We have had no late accounts from Europe or the West Indias. Attempts have been made upon the people of Vermont by the Generals Clinton & Haldimand to seduce them to the British Interest, & I fear not without some success. If we do not soon make them independt. it is probable the British will gain them over.  Ned Rutledge, Gadsden & Young Middleton are dayly expected in this Town from Augustine being exchanged. Admiral Digby with 5 Ships of the line are it is said arrived at New York, the Kings third Son a Midshipman onboard the Adms. Ship. What the French and Spaniards are about none but them does know, but our Interest seems to be considered as a remote object. Your School fellow I believe is not the worst General the British have had in America. He never retreated. It is true that the King of G B. did not accept of the Mediation between him & the U.S. of Hol[lan]d but propose their difference to [be] setled at the General pacification. The English have certainly suffered in the East Indias. I shall make Enquiry of the N E Dels. the mode of packing Hay at Boston, & inform you of the information I may receive.

  My dear Sir, Phila. July 24th. 1781 The last accounts from Genl. Green were that he was obliged to raise the Siege of 96, but expected to come to some action with Lord Rawdon. General Mou'trie who left Charles Town about the 8th Inst. informs that it was reported that Lord Rawdon had retreated from 96 to Orangeburg about 80 Miles from Charles Town and that General Greene had reinvested it.  The last information from the Marquis mentions an action between a part of our Troops & Cornwallis near Wmsburg, the consequence of which was, that Cornwallis crossed James River, and it is generally conjectured here that he intends to Portsmouth, leave a proper Garrison there & then divide the rest of his Troops for New York & S Caro. We lost in killed, wounded and missing about 140, many of our Officers wounded, none killed, a Lieutt. Coll. of the Jerseys taken prisoner. The Marquis says that the British lost many more, but had concealed their Dead. I am afraid that our Execution in this engagement was not great. What prowess Genl. Washington will make against New York God only knows; I confess that my expectations are but small. It is said that two British Ships of the Line, and seven Transports are gone up North River; if this be true it is done to draw the General back towards Westpoint. Mr. Clagget now in Phila. informs me, that there will be great Canvassing for the Electors who are to elect the Senate in Sepr. and that the Landed interest are alarmed by the late Publications against the Members of that body,(1) and that he and Mr. Crawford had offered themselves for the purpose to the people of Prince George's. I wish that the same Spirit may prevail throughout all the Counties, for the safety and happiness of the State depends greatly on the choice to be made at the next Election of Senators. I make not the least doubt but SC (2) whom it is probable will be the Elector for Annaps. will do every thing in his power to turn out most of the present Members, and to get in as many of his friends as he can; therefore it is the business of every friend to the Constitution to do every thing in his power to circumvent him. He has lately met with a mortification from Mr Sharpe Delegate from N.C. who has forbid him any further Correspondence with him. SC has wrote in Answer a most humiliating JULY 24, 1781  Letter indeed but I believe Mr Sharpe will be inflexible but this between ourselves. We have had no late accounts from Europe. Attempts have been made by the Generals Clinton & Haldimand to seduce the people of Vermont & I fear not without some success; if we do not soon make them independant the British will endeavor to do it. Ned Rutledge, Middleton & Gadsden with many others exchanged are dayly expected from Augustine.  Our great Estate as you call it remains in the same situation as it did before the confederation, indeed I think in a much worse. The adoption of that measure after holding out so long will I fear be productive of many ill, but not one good consequence to our State, nor do I believe that our Ally ever hinted to his Minister that the succession of Maryland was a desirable event with him. I wish our Troops were in motion for some place or other, they must distress the inhabitants near them.  This moment I am informed that R. H. Lee has wrote to a Gentn. in Town that Cornwallis was Marching towards the Carolina's. I am not sorry for it, He must lose many of his men should this intelligence prove true.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia 24th July 1781. I am happy to find by your Letter which came to hand Yesterday you were on the 16th at the Bowling Green on your Return Home, (1) where I hope you will in future continue in Safety and undisturbed by his Lordship's plundering Parties. As it is probable from all Accounts they mean to detach either North or South, perhaps both, and leave a Garrison at Portsmouth. I fear, as you do, for the fate of General Greene, unless Succours shall be sent him. We were told there were 2000 twelve Months Men, raised in N. Carolina intended to join him, but have heard nothing of them lately. If these Men are in the Field, or the half of them, and armed, Greene will, with such Militia as he can collect there, be able to oppose the Enemy, unless they detach largely to that Quarter, as the Reinforcement lately arrived at Charlestown were not more than 2000, and these new  JULY 24, 1781  Levies and very sickly insomuch that Numbers of them died on the March to relieve Ninety Six. Virginia shoud not relax, but make every Exertion to equip Horsemen, for, in a large Body of Cavalry consists in great Measure the Protection of a Country so Water intersected as ours, where that Element is in the Command of the Enemy, for while they move with the Wings of the Wind, we shou'd at least be able to move with the Speed of the Horse, to meet them & oppose their Ravages.  The Court of London declines accepting the Mediation of the Empress of Russia, for settling the disputes between Great Britain and the States of Holland, & has referred them over to a general Pacification.  You must have heard of the Extraordinary Capitulation agreed to by the Spanish Commander on the Reduction of Pensacola, whereby it was left open to the Enemy to transport their Troops to New York, where part of them have already arrived, and will no doubt be in Arms for the defence of that Post. Mr. Boudinot read us a Letter yesterday from his Friend at Elizabeth Town of the 20th instant informing him Admiral Digby had arrived at the Hook with 5 Ships of the Line, & it was said had captured a 50 Gun Ship & Frigate of the French. In this Squadron it was also said the third Son of George the 3d came over as a Midshipman, and that a House was taken for him at New York & under Reparation for his Reception. Although not born amongst us, they may perhaps think we shall be pleased, like the Welsh of old, with the Presence of a Prince of the Blood, but what Name will they give him?  Whatever may be the Events of the Campaign, Heaven seems to smile upon us in affording a good and plentiful Harvest, the most abundant this way ever known, & am pleased to find it continues South, tho' I expect the Progress of the Enemy must have lessened the Crops in our State. Adieu. Signed, Jos. Jones.  PS. While in Virginia, I mentioned to you in a Letter to Richmond, some great Questions I expected would be agitated in Congress, and expressed my Wish to know your Sentiments upon them.(2) Are they of so delicate a Nature you choose not to touch them? or by your Silence do you mean to insinuate they ought not to be touched?

  Dear Sir, (1) Philadelphia 24th July 1781. From all Accounts Lord Cornwallis means to detach either North or South perhaps both in which Case the Garrison left at Portsmouth will not give you much Annoyance but be this as it may relax not in your Efforts but be in Condition to meet him when he moves again into the Country which you may rely may be the Case so soon as he is able. Every Attention should be given to the Equipment of Cavalry upon which your Safety greatly depends, while the Enemy have the Command of the Water; for while they move with the Wind, you should be prepared to move with the Speed of the Horse to meet and oppose their Ravages. A private Account from Elizabeth Town to Mr. Boudinot a Member of New Jersey informs that Admiral Digby with 5 Ships of the Line had arrived at the Hook and it was said had captured a fifty Gun Ship and Frigate of the French in this Squadron, it is also said, came the 3d Son of George the 3d as a Midshipman, a House was taken for him in the City and preparing for his Reception. If this be true we shall soon have a Confirmation from the General who now lies at Dob's Ferry with the Army waiting for the proper Opportunity to commence his Operations. What may be expected from France I cannot undertake to say but we have Assurances of every Support in her Power and are not without hope she will command the Water but these Matters are contingent and being uncertain demand the greater Exertions on our Part for our own Safety. By the Capitulation agreed to on the Surrender of Pensacola, the Garrison were permited to go to any British Port but Jamaica or St. Augustine whereby they have been sent to New York where we shall have them to contend with in Addition to the Force at that Place before their Arrival.  The Empress of Russia's Offer to mediate between Great Britain and Holland has been rejected by the former and referred over to a general Pacification. Some intercepted Letters taken in the Falmouth Packet for New York and carried into France and which have been transmitted us by our Minister there clearly opens the Designs and Expectations of the Enemy with respect to the Subjugation of the Southern States as well as continued Delusion and Folly of the British Administration at least the Minister for the American Department whose Letters we have so late as 7th March when their late Successes had so elated them as to leave no Doubt but the Southern States were in Subjection and that the superior Force they had in America would enable Clinton to send Troops up to the Head of  JULY 24, 1781  Chesapeak and in Conjunction with the Loyalists of Maryland and Pennsylvania subdue those States and that General Washington commanding but a handful of Men must cross the Hudson and take Refuge in the Eastern States, where being deprived of Succours and Supplies from the South he must soon be without Men to support him and become a Sacrifice to General Clinton's Army-fine Prospect this to Lord George-but alas! where has it vanished or where did it exist but in his own Imagination? We are told the Dutch are determined to prosecute the War and disposed to be allied to these States. Adieu, Your obedt. Servant, Signed, Jos. Jones  [P.S.] Mrs. Jones, Joe and myself are but so so.

They contain the latest Advices & include every Occurrence worth Communicating. In them you will find the Capitulation entered into  JULY 24, 1781  between the Garrison of Pensacola & the Spanish General. In this Capitulation the Interest of the united States seems to be entirely unattended to, and the Success of the Spaniards in its Consequences in that Instance will be more prejudicial to our Operations, than their failure would have been. The Garrison are arrived at New York & will make a Reinforcement of so many to the British Garrison. The Terms of Capitulation between Genl. Pikens & Coll.

  Sir, Philadelphia 24th July 1781  On Tuesday last Mr. Mowery arrived in Philadelphia and has taken his Seat in Congress accordingly. (1) Congress have lately received, by the Way of France, a large Number of intercepted Letters from Lord George Germaine &c to Sir Henry Clinton &c. In wch. it appears that the British were full in their Expectation of all the States Southward and Westward of the Hudson River being returned to their Allegiance before this Period. They expected that General Washington would be confined to the eastern States, and that Sir Henry Clinton would be able to detach a considerable Force to Nova Scotia to enable General Mc.Clain to reduce the Province of Main, & form an Establishment for the Tories, at and near Penobscot. Under these Circumstances they expected this Campaign would finish the War, & oblige America to supplicate for Peace upon Terms of Submission. From this Apprehension the Court of London has refused the Mediation offered by the Court of Russia for reestablishing Peace between Great Britain and Holland. By Accounts from Virginia, we learn that Lord Cornwallis has divided his Force, one part of which is going Southward, one part to New York, and the remainder will form a Post at Portsmouth.  General Greene has reduced Augusta, but raised the Siege of Ninety-Six. We are informed that Admiral Digby has arrived at New York with Five Sail of the Line, but are not certain. The Court of Versaille is determined to effect a Naval Superiority in these Seas in Course of the Campaign, and appear extremely anxious for the Safety of the united States.  We have the Honor of being Sir, with great Esteem, your Excellency's most obedient, & very humble Servts.  Dnl Mowry J M Varnum P.S. It appears in one of Lord George Germaine's Letters, (2) that Vermont were in the King's Allegiance. We hope this is not true; but shews the Necessity of terminating the Disputes respecting that Territory. Congress are now upon the Subject; but what will be the Result, we cannot ascertain.  ""

  Dear Madam, Philadelphia 24th, July 1781. In my last I promised you a long Letter, and good News, by this day's Post.(1) Neglect would appear the more inexcusable, as the Facts are so recent in my Memory. Without farther Ceremony therefore, I shall enter upon the Detail. We are in Possession of a large Number of intercepted Letters from Lord George Germain and others to Sir Henry Clinton and other British Officers in America. His Lordship supposed that all the States Southward of the Hudson River were before this Time fully possessed by the King's Troops, and had universally returned to their Allegiance. He concluded that General Washington would be no longer able to draw Men or Provisions from the Westward of that River; but would be confined to the eastern States. Concluding that his Force would be contemptible, he informed Sir Henry that he would be able to detach a Considerable Force to Nova Scotia to enable General McClain to subdue the Province of Main and form a permanent Establishment for the Tories at and near Penobscot, That under these Circumstances the Americans would soon be induced to solicit Peace upon Terms of Submission. Admitting these Facts to exist, his Lordship would undoubtedly be right in his Conclusion, that the Powers of Europe must decide the Soverignty of the United States in favor of Great Britain, as they alone could Support the Claim of Territory upon the prevailing Principles of a firm Possession. Infatuated with the momentary Charm of these Airy Prospects, the Court of London have refused the Offers of Russia to mediate between them and the United Provinces. In Consequence of which the Dutch must fight them at all Events: And being totally deceived in their American Expectations, their Delusion will happily serve to frustrate their oppressive Views, and encrease the rising Glory of the United States. By recent & probable Accounts, Lord Cornwallis has divided his Army in Virginia, a part of which will go Southward, and a part to New York, but as the Pennsylvania Line will undoubtedly follow, I hope General Greene will not suffer any Injury from this Movement. I have lately received a Letter from the General. He was well, but very much fatigued. He expresses his great Satisfaction in your Resolution not to follow him, as you would be in a very disagreable Situation. We have received Information that Admiral Digby has arrived at New York with five Sale of the Line, & the King's third Son on Board, in Quality of a Midshipman; Whether this is true or not, you will probably know before this Letter can reach you. However, I hope it will not have an essential Influence upon General Washington's Operations. JULY 24, 1781  To this Place I expect to be confined 'till October next. A disagreable, but possibly a necessary Fate. One thing I know, that if I cannot do any good, I do prevent some Mischief. There is Not a Particle of Air which floats in the Atmosphere but is impregnated with Toryism. Disease teems in every Exhalation, & Death grins in every Chasm; but, being long accustomed to contend with spiritual Wickednesses in high Places, I feel myself pretty secure. But the frequent Attacks in the pettite Guerre, producing Spasms, Diarrheas &c. demonstrate the Necessity of the most exact Regularity & Temperance in living; Otherwise, serious Lodgements might be made upon the Glories of the principal Work, & the earthly Tabernacle be reduced thro' an irreparable Breach. Should the Assaults however be continued, the Garrison will be reduced by Necessity to transfer the Seat of War, or surrender at Discretion; but as I shall undoubtedly prefer the former, I am determined to remove all the heavy Baggage by the first of October next, when the Tabernacle will follow, as a light Corps, & form Winter Quarters in the State of Rhode Island. So much for my Promise. Have I fulfilled my Ingagement? Possibly too fully, but it is better to be [...] (2) much than not to be righteous at a [...] be a little more diffuse, and attempt to clo[...] with a little Amusement; but we are this [...en]gaged in a very interesting Debate in Congress, [...] Ideas are not at Liberty to indulge upon diverting Subjects: But being confident your Candor will excuse me, I must take the Liberty of concluding With the most sincere Wishes for your Happiness.

I shall not detain the Express on Account of any other Communications at present, and shall therefore subscribe myself, with the utmost Regard, Your Excellency's Most obedient & most humble Servant, Tho M:Kean President  ""

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia, 27 July, 1781. We have this instant been notified of the present opportunity to your Army, and with infinite satisfaction embrace it, to testify to you the high sense we have of your arduous exertions for the honor & welfare of the department in general, and for the State of Georgia in particular.(1) In the name of the people of that State, we beg leave to offer to you our most grateful and sincere thanks. Permit us also to add, that it is the constant theme of all orders and ranks of men this way, that you have done wonders, however much the unlucky reinforcement to the enemy may vary the scene.  We flatter ourselves that the people of Georgia will immediately organize their Constitutional form of Government, of which they are very fond; & feel the utmost confidence, from the earnest you have given us, that you will afford it every possible Countenance & support.(2)  The appointment of Major Jackson (3) to raise a corps in that State, is also a great proof of your discernment. He is a young gentleman particularly distinguished for his inflexible integrity, undaunted bravery, and zealous love for his Country; and we have the highest expectations from the arrangement.  We lament the cruelties that must have taken place, after your putting our people again in possession of their Country: but we ought to make great allowances for the feelings of the father, the husband, the friend-the british have set the melancholy example- Retaliation may be carried too far. We would fain hope it has not been the case with our constituents: but we admit the foundation of implacable resentments.  We beg leave to assure you, Dear Sir, that, let the issue of your command be what it may, in the face of such difficulties, we shall  JULY 28, 1781  always admire and esteem you; being with the greatest respect and regard, your much obliged, & most Obedient servants,  Geo.

  Sir(1) Philadelphia. July 28th. 1781 I think it a Duty as well as an honor to have the Pleasure of addressing you on my taking a Seat in Congress as one of your Delegates, and shall be very glad of a continued Correspondence while at this Place, as I should be allways glad to Conform myself to the general Ideas of my Constituents. I set off for this Place on the 1 8th Instt. but was much surprized on my arrival here to find that by the resolution of the Joint Meeting appointing Dr Elmore & myself, that we are restricted from representing the State of New Jersey unless one of the former delegates are present. This we consider as making an invidious Distinction between us, and could not have taken our Seats under this partial Appointment consistent with our reputation & feelings had not Dr. Witherspoon assured us that it must be a bare misprision of the Clerk, this has prevailed on me to continue here till we can hear from you, which I must beg to be by return of the next Stage. I would be glad of your information what appeared to you to be the Sense of the Legislature, for tho' Congress make no Objection to our representing the State, yet it will not be safe or prudent for us to vote alone, under the express declaration of the State to the Contrary unless we are properly assured that it is a Mistake.(2) As this goes by the Stage, which is an uncertain Conveyance, I can say nothing in point of News but what may be made publick, with safety. Our affairs both abroad and to the Southward, bear the most flattering Aspects, and we are encouraged to hope & Expect the happiest Consequences from the continued Struggles of this Year. It JULY 28, 1781  is a matter of the highest Consequence, that the requisitions of our worthy General on the different States be punctually & immediately Complied with. You could not do a more essential Service to these States, than to urge the completion of the levies for the Army. Lord Cornwallis has returned to Portsmouth and the Marquis after gaining great Laurels in his late attack on his Lordship is refreshing his little Army, so as at the same time to cover the Country.  Could you with propriety communicate what you consider as the Ideas of our Legislature, relative to the dispute of Vermont & the expediency of their being declared a free & independent State, I should be much obliged.

  Sir Philadelphia July 28. 1781 Mr. Johnston, who left this place on the 14th instant will communicate to your Excellency every thing material from this quarter on his arival in the state.  I greatly lament the absence of so able a representative and of so judicious and very agreable collegue. Upon the resignation of Mr. Huntington he was almost unanimously elected and earnestly solicited to take the chair; but his ill state of health and other considerations induced him to decline it.(1) The most particular object which rendered it necessary for me to continue here a few weeks longer was to procure and forward arms to our State agreeable to a resolution of Congress which we obtained for that purpose on the 26 of April a copy of which I do myself the honor to inclose. The enemy being in force in Virginia made it necessary that the arms first repaired should be sent there. The want of money and the deranged condition of the laboratories are the causes of this business going on so slow. Fifteen hundred stand are all that we can get at present. Five hundred are now ready; it may be three or four weeks before the remainder are finished. On application I have obtained an order for 1500 cartouch boxes and a sufficient quantity of fixed amunition. The arms are equal to any in the army, with good bayonets. The next great difficulty is for the quarter-master to procure waggons for the transportation. I shall spare no pains nor leave any thing in my power unessayed to have them forwarded without loss of time.  The Superintendent of finance and the board of war have such difficulties in the dispensation of our small fund of money, that without my close attention the State will never recieve one of those necessary articles. Tho your delegates here have not received any explicit instructions on this subject, yet I flatter myself that our conduct will meet with the entire approbation of your Excellency and the legislature. I am perswaded that if the State had been well armed Lord Cornwallis would not have been permitted to march and countermarch through that country and plunder its best citizens with impunity.  Our Frigate Alliance arived at Boston about the 8th of June. Six weeks before which the Ship Marquis de la Fayette (with all our cloathing, arms &c on board) was seperated from her in a heavy gale of wind and not since heard of. It is supposed that she foundered. It is also supposed that the same fate attended the vessel on board of which Colo. Palfrey sailed for France last December. Such is the strange fatality which attend our procuring supplies from France that the court have determined to send a quantity under their own immediate direction. JULY 28, 1781  A Letter dated in April hath been recieved from Colo. Laurens which gives a prospect of some further pecuniary aid from that quarter. Conferrences on the subject of a general pacification will probably not open before the close of this campaign. The seperate mediation offered by the court of Petersburg between the States General and England hath been deferred by the latter until the general negociations shall open.  This event is thought favourable to the common cause and was probably dictated by the same delusive views and principles which are manifested in Lord George Germains letters to Sir H. Clinton. About that time the british ministry were informed of the defection in the Pennsylvania and New Jersey lines of the army-The intercepted letters in the eastern mail containing a dismal picture of our affairs-The parade and pomposity of Lord Cornwallis in the southern States-and the flattering prospects which his Lordship and Sir Henry entertained at that time of subduing america, together with the hope that the inhabitants of Vermont would join the Canadian forces this campaign) and formed the data of Germains letters. The most conspicuous of those intercepted letters are contained in the inclosed papers, to which I beg leave to refer you.  A letter has lately been received from Madrid. That court pertinaciously insists on those things which have so long been their object, so that a treaty with them is apparently remote. Our money negociations goes on with a little more ease than formerly and Mr. Jay has obtained some cloathing for our army.  Should any thing material occur while I continue here I will with pleasure communicate it.  I presume it is unnecessary for me to request your particular attention to keep up our representation in Congress. I am perswaded that you view it with me as a matter of great consequence to the southern states and I doubt not that every effort will be used to accomplish it.  With the highest respect and esteem I have the honor to be, Your Excellencys Most Obedient Humble Servt. Wm. Sharpe  ""

  My dearly beloved Wife, Philadelphia July 29th. 1781. Tho late in the Evening, I am glad to get rid of my fellow Lodgers, and retire from their very disagreeable Company (on this day) to hold converse with my better Self. As it is uncertain whether I shall have time to write again before the Post goes, shall inform you of my Situation. JULY 29, 1781  I tryed in vain to get Lodgings near the State House, and altho' I was kindly invited to my old Quarters, yet the irregularity of Congress Hours & the Circumstances of the family were such as obliged me to refuse it. The City is so filled with the distressed Georgia & Carolina refugees, that I was afraid I should be prevented getting any Quarters out of a Tavern. At last I have got a room at a Mrs. Clarks, in the House Mr. Searle formerly lived, at the Corner of Chestnut & front Streets opposite Woods the Watch-maker. I am in the third Story & with very disagreeable Company, particularly on the Sabbath. I give 7 Dollars per Week for my Board & find my own Drink, wood & Candles. My Situation is not very desirable & my Services here, not such as will satisfy me for the loss of what I prize above all temporal Pleasures I mean domestic Ease & Happiness. I know it may be answered that I am destitute of that laudable ambition & Pursuit of Honor that should urge every Man to activity. I confess I have other Views & other Pursuits-and as I find so many ready to supply my deficiencies in this respect, that I am contented to pass thro' Life in humble Obscurity, if it be [the] will of my heavenly father, who has a right to dispose of me & my Services as he shall see best. Resignation to his will is I hope the great Pursuit of my Life. If nothing turns up here, more than at present, I shall try to be home about the 20t Augt. I got my Trunk safe but have been obliged to get a new pair of Buckles mine not being sent. I have no News to Communicate except that in general our affairs both abroad & at Home (I mean to the Southward) wear the most flattering Appearances. Lord Cornwallis since his drubbing by General Wayne, has retreated quite to Portsmouth & the Marquis is refreshing his Troops in such Manner as to cover the Country. Julia goes on Tuesday for Princeton, so that I shall then be all alone.  I hope my beloved Wife is much happier with her little family about her, than I am here. If I was convinced that I was doing essential Service to my Country, it would give me Pleasure even to forego that large Share of Happiness I have left behind, but I feel myself inadequate to the Errand on which I am sent, and ardently wish some Person of superior Talents was in my room. I am not so humble as to suppose I am not as equal to the Task as many that have been here before me, but their deficiency does not give me Capacity. I am convinced the Affairs of America requires now the Abilities of a Pitt & a Necker to preside over her Councils. However I did not choose myself, nor ever did solicit the Choice from any other Person, and therefore while I remain in this important Station, will make up by Integrity & Application my want of those other Qualifications necessary for this important Trust.  I will leave this Letter unfinished till Tuesday.  Monday Night.(1) What shall I say to my beloved Wife-in distress & pain, and no tender Hand to afford relief, or sympathetic Heart to   partake of her distresses-alass! such is the incertainty & inconstancy of this variegated Scene. Your kind affectionate Letter gave me much uneasiness & tho obliged, greatly obliged by it, yet as sorry you gave yourself the Trouble when in Pain. How unfortunate an Accident! Why was you not more Carefull. I pray God-who has so constantly done us good, to restore you to perfect Ease, Happiness & Comfort. I am glad Matters go so well at Home. I wish you may have nothing to perplex or trouble your Mind, while so confined. Had you put your foot immediately in Cold Water from the Spring, it would greatly have relieved you.  I am much surprized at Mr Livingston's Conduct. I can not find out what he means by it-tell him from me I think it neither friendly nor generous. I recovered the Money at his request being employed by him and have had trouble enough with it, thro' all the distress of the Country and that for nothing, and yet he is not content. I am much pleased with what you did. I wish it had been more severe.  This Morning for the first time I met Mr. Reed in the Street riding. I did not know him but as soon as he saw me, he dismounted & came up to me in the most friendly manner & shook me heartily by the hand, asked kindly after you & Susan, and insisted on my going immediately home with him. This I refused & was rather Cool. He insisted on my calling to see him &c &c. This has surprized me much. I suppose I must go, tho agt the Grain. I must wish the beloved of my Soul a good Night may the blessing of a holy God attend her and the Angel of his Presence keep & preserve her & all my dear Family. My kind Love to all that inquire after me. Love to Sister & her little Flock. I am distressed to hear she has again been visited with the Fever-dont for get Molly & the Servts. Tell Josey I depend greatly upon him.  I am with the greatest Love & Affection, Yours sincerely,  E Boudinot P.S.

  Sir, Philadelphia, July 31 1781. I have been at this Place so short a Time, (1) that I am unable to inform you of many of the special Matters of Public Concernment now before Congress. The Arrangement of the different Boards, a further proposed Confederation, and the settlement of the Dispute with Vermont seem to be the Principal Objects talked of; The last more especially, which congress have had under Consideration for some time before our Arrival. Some intercepted Letters from Lord G. Germaine on this Subject, and the Sollicitations of New Hampsire, 'tis said induced them to take up this Business without a Representation from New York. (2) The Plan is, which is a Report of a Committee, to recommend it to New York and New Hampshire, to relinquish their Jurisdiction or to consult on the Propriety of doing it to the State of Vermont, according to her former Claim, the Massachusets having already passed a Law for that purpose provided the other States would do the same.(3) This Report being the order of this Day, was recommitted.(4) This Plan probably might in some degree exculpate Congress from blame, and they might with better Grace refer the sufferers to the State, who had voluntarily relinquished their jurisdiction, for Compensation for their Lands; 'tis Said a Person from our State lately informed some Members of Congress that a Majority of the Assembly and a greater Part of the Senate were in favour of granting their Independence. Possibly this might have some Effect. The Committee to whom was refered our Remonstrance against the Commissions from Connecticut and the late Ordanance of Congress have not yet Reported,(5) tho they have promised me it shall be done tomorrow, & I make no doubt it will be favorable. The Instructions from the Admiralty I am told is pointed against going on the Land and confines all Captures to the Water, which will be publicly made known.  The Inclosed Paper contains the News of the Day. We hear nothing late from Genl. Green to be depen[d]ed on. Good judges  JULY 31, 1781  here say that the Enemy cannot do any thing further to effect in Virginia which induces them to think they will be recalled to New York. A great Number of Refugee families have lately arrived here in flags of Truce from Charles Town, in distressed Circumstances, having there changed their hard Money for Paper, expecting to make a profit on the same here. The Inhabitants of this City at present are very kind to the unhappy Sufferers. I wish it may continue.  I am Sir with the greatest Respect and Esteem your Excellency's most obedt. Servt.

The mail of last week having been intercepted near Wilmington has kept back the post a day later than his usual arrival, and I have now but a few moments for the discharge of my epistolary duty. The only certain information we have lately had from Europe is that the Mediation tendered by Russia in the dispute between England & Holland has been referred by the former to the General pacification in which the mediation of the Emperor will be joined with it. As this step is not very respectful to Russia, it can only proceed from a distrust of her friendship, & their hopes of a favorable issue to the Campaign which an intercepted letter from Ld. G. Germaine shews to [be] extravagantly sanguine. There has been nothing from the W. Indies for several weeks. General Washington is continuing his preparations & progress agst. N. York.

The Independence of Vermont has taken up several days in Congress, the Idea is more familiar, and not so shocking even to the Dominion as formally, & tho' I have no great apprehentions that the Enemy can bring over those people to their obedience; yet I think it necessary to do something to quiet their minds and Settle the Affairs which I believe will soon take place.  I am very glad to see the same Gentlemen are in Council as last year, and doubt not but your Business must go on easy & well while this is the Case.  For news I must refer you to the inclosd. paper and shall only add that 4 or 5 Cartels have lately arrived from Charlestown & Augustine with some soldiers, but principally Citizens from Charlestown, who have been driven out by the Enemy from the city & taken from Guard ships. Many of these people are gentlemen who have lived in ease & affluence, but are now real objects of Charity & compassion; as the Enemy, contrary to the faith of the most solemn treaty, & every feeling of humanity, denyd. them the smallest pittance of their own Estates.

And in case they relinquish their Claims of Jurisdiction over the Grants on the west Side of Connecticut River, Bounded, East by Said River, North by Latitude forty five degrees, West by lake Champlain and the west lines of Several Townships Granted by the Governor of New Hampshire, to the North west corner of Massachusetts; and South by the North line of Massachusetts; Congress will Guaranty the Land & Jurisdiction belonging to the Said States respectively Iying without the Said limits, against all claims & Encroachments of the people within those limits.\"" What will be Ultimately done in Congress is uncertain. Some Gentlemen are for declaring Vermont an Independent State, others, for explicitly recommending to the States aforesaid to relinquish their claims of Jurisdiction, others, only for referring it to their consideration as reported by the Committee, and Some few are against doing any thing that will tend to make a new State. I am of opinion that a Speedy, & Amicable Settlement of the controversy would conduce very much to the peace & welfare of the united States, And that it will be difficult if not impracticable to reduce the people on the east side of the River to Obedience to the Government of New Hamshire until the other dispute is Settled, that the longer it remains unsettled, the more difficult it will be to remedy the evils, but if the States of New Hamshire & New York would follow the example of Massachusetts, respecting the Grants on the west of Connecticut River, waiting for a recommendation of Congress, the whole controversy would be quieted, very much to the advantage and Satisfaction of the united States, and that the Inhabitants of New Hamshire and JULY 31, 1781  New York living without the limits of the disputed territory would return to their Allegiance. The British Ministry esteem it as object of Great importance to them, to engage the people of Vermont in their Interest, and have accordingly Instructed Gen. Clinton & Gen. Haldiman to use their best endeavours for that end. And tho' I dont think the people have any inclination to come under the British Yoke, or to do anything injurious to this Country, yet if left in their present Situation, they may be led to take Steps very prejudicial to the United States...(2) I think it very unlikely, that Congress can attend to the Settlement of the dispute by a Judicial decision, during the War, for though the parties were heard last fall respecting their claims, yet it cannot now be determined upon the right, without a new hearing, because there are many New Members that were not then present.  I am credibly Informed that a great Majority of the members of the Legislature of the State of New York at their last winter session were willing to relinquish their claim of Jurisdiction over that district, and that they Should be admitted to be a Seperate State, but the Governor for Some reasons prevented an act passing at that time. We have No News remarkable here. Paper currency is very much at an end, Some of the New Bills are bought & Sold, but Silver and Gold are the only currency-the prices of Commodities are much fallen, many articles are as low, as before the war.

I also send a number of little books to be added to the library of Miss Fanny.  The letter I intended to have written by Capt. M. Walker, was by accident prevented from getting into his hands in time. The newspapers inclosed in it with a large addition are sent by this conveyance. As they are continued down to the present day it would be tautology to enter into the current intelligence. We have heard little of late from Europe, except that the Mediation proferred by Russia in the dispute between England & Holland has been referred by the former to the general pacification in which the mediation of the Emperor will be joined with that of Russia. As this step is not very respectful to Russia it can only proceed from a distrust of her friendship and the hopes entertained by Britain as to the issue of the Campaign, which as you will see in an intercepted letter from Germaine to Clinton were extravagantly sanguine. We have no late intelligence from the W. Indies. Genl Washington is going on with his preparations & operations agst. N. York. What the result will be can be decided by time alone. We hope they will at least with draw some of the Invaders from Virginia. The French fleet is still at Rhode Island. The British it is reported has lately left the Hook.  Augst. 2d. Information has been recd. from N. York thro' a channel that is thought a good one, that orders are gone to Virginia for a large part of the troops under Cornwallis immediately to sail for that place.(2) Should this be well founded the execution of the orders will announce it to you. Among other advantages attending an Evacuation of Virga. it will not be the least that the communication with this place by the Bay will supply the State with many necessary Articles wch. are now transported by land at so much expence & will enable you to pay for them easier by raising the price of your commodities. It gives me pain to hear that so many of the  AUGUST 1, 1781  people have incautiously sold or rather given away their Tobo. to Speculators when it was in no danger from the Enemy.

  Sir, Philadelphia, August 3. 1781  Your Excellency's Favor of the 30th last Month came safe to hand, and the Packet for the Marquis has been dispatched by Express. (1) The Letter for Mrs. Washington was immediately delivered. This Morning I received by Express a Letter from the Marquis, dated Malvern Hill the 26 last, (2) informing that two Battalions of light Infantry & the Queens Rangers were certainly, and the Guards with one or two British Regiments and some Cavalry were probably embarked for New York under Convoy of the Charon of 44 Guns, three Frigates and two 20 Gun Ships of War, and commanded by General Lesslie. The whole Fleet consisitng of 49 Sail had fallen down to Hampton Road. The Enemy gave out that their Embarkation was for Potowmack & Chesapeake, and that Lord Cornwallis himself commanded.  By private Information from New York I learn, that Lord Cornwallis had at first declined sending Simcoe's Corps and the Light Infantry, to the Amount of 1500 in the whole, which had been sent for by Sir Henry Clinton; that this had created considerable Bickerings between the two Generals, and that a peremptory Order had been issued to Cornwallis-that New York was every where strongly fortified and put in the best Posture of Defence, and that every Inhabitant was on constant Duty-that Admiral Digby, with ten Sail of the Line, was expected daily, and that they were in every Respect ready to resist any Attack you might make. If we can do no more this Campaign we shall oblige the Enemy to act on the defensive, a Circumstance so totally different from the Expectations of Lord George Germain, that it will be near to a Victory.

  [August 3, 1781] To the United States of America in Congress Assembled. (1)  The underwritten Delegates for the State of New York have the Honour, in Obedience to an express Instruction from the Legislature of the State of New York to represent, that on the 24th Day of September 1779 it was unanimously resolved by Congress, (2) that it be most earnestly recommended to the States of New Hampshire, Massachusets and New York (among other Things) forthwith to pass Laws to refer to the Decision of Congress all Differences and Disputes relative to Jurisdiction over the District called the New Hampshire Grants which they respectively had with the People of that District so that Congress might proced thereon on the first day of February then next. And Congress did thereby pledge their Faith to carry into Execution, and support their Decision and Determination in the Premises.  That Congress having declared it to be essential to the Interest of the whole Confederacy, that all intestine Dissentions be carefully avoided, and domestick Peace and good Order maintained; it was further unanimously Resolved that it was the Duty of the People of the District aforesaid who denied the jurisdiction of all the aforesaid States to abstain in the mean Time from exercising any Power over any of the Inhabitants of the said District, who profess themselves to be Citizens of, or to owe Allegiance to any or either of the said States but that none of the Towns either on the East or west side of Connecticut River were to be considered as included within the said District but such as had theretofore joined in denying the Jurisdiction of either of the said States, and had assumed a seperate Jurisdiction which they calld the state of Vermont. And further that in the Opinion of Congress the three States aforesaid ought in the mean Time to suspend executing their Laws over any of the Inhabitants of the said District, except such of them as professed Allegiance to, and confessed the Jurisdiction of the same respectively; And further that Congress would consider any Violencies committed against the Tenor, true Intent and Meaning of that Resolution, as a break of the Peace of the Confederacy which they were determined to keep and maintain.  And it was further Resolved unanimously that in the Opinion of Congress no unappropriated Lands or Estates which were or might be adjudged forfited or Confiscated lying in the said District ought, until the final Decision of Congress in the Premises to be granted or sold.  That in Pursuance of the said Recommendation the Legislature of the State of New York passed a Law fully authorizing Congress (among other Things) to hear and determine all Differences and  AUGUST 3, 1781  Disputes relative to Jurisdiction between the State of New York and such of the Inhabitants of that Part of the said District which lies on the west Side of Connecticut River as denyed the Jurisdiction of that State, and that the said Decision being duly made and published should be and remain final and conclusive against that State forever.(3)  That in Conformity to the said Resolution and Law and at great Expence, the state of New York made the necessary Preparations for supporting their territorial Rights, and simular Steps were taken on the Part of the State of New Hampshire.  That on the 19th Day of September 1780, all the Parties concerned in the said Controversy (the Massachusets Bay excepted) attended, namely the Delegates and Agents for the States of New York and New Hampshire respectively; Ira Allen and Stephen Bradley in Behalf of the People of the Grants claiming a seperate and Independant Jurisdiction. Luke Knolton Agent on Behalf of a Number of Towns within that Part of the said District known by the name of the County of Cumberland, and Peter Olcott and Bazaleel Woodward agent for the Towns in the Northern Parts of the said District on both sides of Connecticut River and the Delegates as agents for the State of New York laid before Congress Evidence with an intent to prove that the District known by the Name of the New Hampshire Grants on the west side of Connecticut River is within the Limits of the State of New York: That the State of New Hampshire had acknowledged this, and that the People of the said District had been represented in the Legislature of New York since the Year 1764, and submitted to the Authority, Jurisdiction and Government of the Congress and Convention of the said State 'till late in the year of 1777 and therefore have no Right to a seperate & Independant Jurisdiction: That on the 27th Day of the said month of September all the Parties being present except Messrs. Allen and Bradley Agents for the People of the Grants claiming a seperate and Independant Jurisdiction, who altho duly notified now declined any further Attendance; The Agents for the State of New Hampshire proceeded to offer Evidence tending to prove, that the Tract of Country known by the Name of the New Hampshire Grants, was within the state of New Hampshire and that Therefore the People Inhabiting the said Tract of Country can have no Right to a seperate and Independant Jurisdiction. That Luke Knolton Agent on Behalf of part of the County of Cumberland within the said District, and Peter Olcott and Basalael Woodward Agents from the Towns in the Northern Part of the New Hampshire Grants on both sides of Connecticut River being respectively called upon, and having nothing to add, and pressing Congress to come to a Determination withdrew.  That the Delegates of the State of New York have repeatedly  entreated Congress to decide the Matters in Questi[on] respecting the Claim of an independant State set up by some [ofl the Inhabitants of the District aforesaid, but a Decision has hitherto been defered.  The underwritten Delegates are further instructed to re[pre]sent that the state of New York in complyance with the Resolutions [ofl Congress before recited, have hitherto suspended the Execution of those Laws over any of the Inhabitants of the said District except such as professed Allegiance to and confessed the Jurisdiction of the same and have refrained from granting any Lands within the said District. The Inhabitants who deny our Jurisdiction on the Contrary have strengthned their Party by disposing of those Lands and exercised Force to compel their Neighbours within the said Dis[trict] who profess themselves to be Citizens of and to owe Allegia[nce] to the state of New York to submit to their Authority: and in Violation of the express Resolutions of Congress have passed Acts to include within their Assumed Jurisdiction Several Considerable Settlements extending Westward from the Claim they set up, at the Time of passing the said Resolutions, to the middle of Hudson's River. That these high handed Incroachments have greatly interrupted the raising of Levies and Supplies within the State of New York for the support of the War; And must be productive of further Weakness and Disorder and under the said State, already greatly exhausted and desolated, altogether unable to contribute to the Common Cause.  From these weighty Considerations the underwritten are expressly instructed by the Legislature of the State of New York to Urge Congress agreably to their said Resolutions and Engagements to decide the Controv[ersy] so long subsisting, respecting the Claim of independant Jurisdiction set up under the pretended State of Vermont: and to take Measures in the mean time for restraining the Incroachments of the said Inhabitants, at least within the Bounds which they themselves have till the late extraordinary extention considered represented & Claimed as comprehending the New Hampshire Grants.  The underwritten do therefore by this publick Act, which they pray may be received and filed among the Records of the United States, make known the just Expectations and earnest Request of the Legislature of the State of New York: declaring their readiness to lay before such of the members of Congress as may be uninformed, satisfactory Evidence of the Title of New York to all that Part of the Controverted District which lies on the west Side of Connecticut River.  Done at Philadelphia in Obedience to the express Instructions of the Legislature of the State of New York, the 3d Day of August 1781 and in the Sixth Year of our Independance.  AUGUST 6, 1781  Jas.

Town much indisposed but bound soon for England and that Leslie was met by the Flag on board the Carrisfort going to Chs. Town to  AUGUST 6, 1781  take the Command. A Packet was just arrived from England by which accounts were received that the greatest part of the fleet with the Statia plunder had been taken by Adml. Ia M. Picquet and carryed into France, very pleasing news if it prove true.  No late accounts from Europe or the W. Indies. The Dons seem to play the game wholely for themselves-instance their avidity for territorial cession on the Mississippi and the exclusive Navigation of that River, and the late extraordinary capitulation at Pensacola. The neutral combination has at length drawn from Britain an instruction to her Ships of War and armed Vessells not to interrupt the commerce of the Baltic. We are told Holland is disposed to an alliance with these States, it may be so; but I fear she has a remnant of Spanish indolence & inactivity that requires heating before She will rouse to vigorous action for as yet I discover but feeble efforts. Let us look at Home where matters are more pleasing from the successes of the present Campaign and if we persue our advantage will place us in a respectable situation before the Negociators at the Congress when they convene and if you shall be able to push the point at N.Y. and be ultimately crowned with success, I shall be very indifferent abt. Spanish or Dutch alliances especially the first; as I confess I do not relish their behavior to us on more occasions than one, but enough of this.  We have had much debate abt. Vermont-nothing yet determined, but think it will terminate in appointing persons to settle with them the terms of their admission into the Union.  By the Marquis you will be informed of the British fleet moving up the Bay the 31st ult. with abt. 3000 troops on board destined it was supposed for Baltimore.

  To the Printer.  [August 6? 1781 ] In the reply of Tenax to Jurisperitus in your last paper (1) I find he is a little sore; this proves he is not altogether callous, tho' I should have been more pleased if he had pointed out that part of the Constitution, of Pennsylvania which provides, \""that no man shall hold more than one place of power,\"" as he was particularly called upon for it. I would ask, which is most blameable, with respect to decorum, he who violates the truth, or he who proves the charge.  In spite of conviction, he still would insinuate that a Judge of Pennsylvania ought not to sit in Congress, tho' a Delegate for another State, and he artfully cites only three words of the sentence, viz. sit in Congress, where as if he had given the whole as Jurisperitus has candidly done, there could remain no doubt of the meaning of the Convention. The sentence is \""The Judges of the Supream court shall not be allowed to sit as members in the continental Congress Executive Council, or general Assembly\"". They cannot therefore sit as members in the Executive Council or General Assembly, more than in Congress; now let us inquire, what Council or Assembly was had in contemplation, surely those for Pennsylvania, because the words Executive Council and General Assembly are not used, as Jurisperitus has told us, in the Constitution of any other State; and of course they are not excluded even by words from sitting in the Congress or Council, Senate or Assembly for any other State. Can Tenax believe, that the Convention had the power or inclination to direct the Governments of other States, or to restrain them from employing whom they thought proper in any of their offices of trust or profit, or that they had any other State in view but Pennsylvania.  A Judge of Pennsylvania can hold any office whatsoever, which is not derived from the State of Pennsylvania, and there is neither any (Constitution) law nor reason against it, and this has been the opinion of all men, whom I ever heard mention the subject, even if Tenax himself [ . . . ] not remark, & if then The Presidency of Congress is an office, any Judge of Pennsylvania may hold it, because he is not appointed by that Government, but if it is a Station of the same nature with that of Speaker of an House of Assembly for a particular State, how can it be more an office than that of any other Delegate?  With respect to fees and perquisites, Tenax quibbles just like himself. He has been asked, whether a Judge of Pennsylvania may not practise the law in another State; (and take fees) fees & perquisites would in such case be taken literally, but to this he gives no answer.

  QUERIES to TENAX.  August 6, 1781.(1) Do you not know, that the chief justice of Pennsylvania, was, at the time of his appointment, speaker of the house of assembly, soon after commander in chief, and for near four years since constantly a delegate for the Delaware state?  If so, and you thought it a violation of the constitution, why did you not heretofore mention it to him, or publish your sentiments as you have now done?  Do you not know that the honorable William Henry Drayton, esq. sat in congress for two years as a member of South Carolina, being at the same time chief justice of that state; that the honorable William Paca, esq. was at the same time chief justice and a member of congress for the state of Maryland; that the honorable John Jay, esq. was chief justice of New-York during the time he was president of congress; that the honorable Samuel Huntington, esq. the last president of congress, was, during the whole time, a justice of the supreme court of Connecticut; and that there are several of the present members of congress who are justices of the supreme court in their respective states?  Can the chief justice of Pennsylvania sit upon the decision of any controversy between that state and any other; or can a delegate for the Delaware state have any share in determining whether the islands in the river belong to Delaware or Pennsylvania? Have you ever read the confederation of the several states, or do you understand it?  Do you understand the doctrine of replevins, impeachments, or the rights of sovereign independent states? Would it not be adviseable to qualify yourself in this respect, before you assume the office of REFORMER or CENSOR-GENERAL?

The movement of the Enemy up the Bay is contrary to the judgement of the Learned in war at this place; but I have thought it probable his Gallant Lordship woud not Leave our State unvisited in his Tour. If New York does not appear to him to be in such immediat danger, as to make a reinforcement immediately necessary-affairs in the South must pinch his Lordship severely. Several flags have arrvd here from Augustine & Charles Town within these few days. The Gentlemen by these Vessels inform us that 96 has been evacuated (this acknowledgd by Rivington) that a Body of the Enemy have been attackd & drove from Monks Corners with Considerable loss of men & all their baggage which they were obligd to distroy (the Charles Town Gazettee says almost as much), That our parties are almost every day within 5 or 6 Miles of Charles Town & have cut of several Small parties of the Enemy, That the Body of troops left at Orangeburgh (the Remainder of Lord Rawdons force that relievd 96) was Surrounded, & likely to fall into our hands. If this last shou'd prove true, what will prevent Genl Greene from making a triumphant entry into Charles Town unless Cornwallis turns his face that way immediately.

He was a Brigadier of the Militia, and AUGUST 7, 1781  acting as such, when he was taken; he was esteemed and held as such by the Enemy; And he signed all official papers, during his confinement, in that character.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia August 7. 1781.  I am favoured with yours of the 23d of July. I am sorry to hear of the embarrassment the state is under in regard to currency-'tis  AUGUST 7, 1781  what I expected. Silver & gold is plenty here. Flour brings a good price & hard mony at Havannah, which fills both the merchant & husbandman with hard mony. Newhampshire seems to have nothing to export, consequently hard cash must be scarce.  We have been long disputing abt Vermont, nothing is decided. However the event will be, as I conjecture, to make the grants west of the river independent. The main point now is how to quiet the remainder. Congress is vastly changed since I was here in Feb. 1780. And I have been told in congress, when insisting to have the grants wholly annexed to Newhampshire, that I did not speak the wish or voice of my state. My business now is if possible to secure the grants east of the river. We shall proceed in the business I suppose today & tomorrow.(1) Genl Sullivan sets out for Newhampshire by whom you will be more fully informed. If this business should end before November, as I hope it will, my wish is to be then relieved. It would be tedious for me to return 18th Jany. the time my appointment expires, and as tedious for the delegate that should be chosen to relieve me. I shall draw on you for £100 consistent with my letter of the 24th of July which gave you 2 months notice. Genl. Sullivan will bring you a set of Journals.

How their Distresses will be alleviated is difficult to tell: Humanity to the Enemy Prisoners seems to be no longer a Virtue; Retaliation through the Medium of the Simsbury Mines, may possibly awaken them to a Sense of Duty.(2)  By the last Accounts from Maryland, the Fleet with Lord Cornwallis amounting to near forty Sail, and having on Board (it is supposed) near three thousand Troops, had proceeded on the 1st Instant from Hampton Road towards Anapolis:(3) His Lordship  AUGUST 7, 1781  himself was said to remain at Portsmouth, and two Men of War & eight Transports in Hampton Road. Governor Lee had on Saturday last six hundred Regulars at Annapolis, and was collecting the Militia; he appears to be in good Spirits. This Intelligence has been sent to the Presidents of Delaware & Pennsylvania. Can this Manoeuvre be to draw the Marquis's Forces on this Side James River, in Order to facilitate the March of the Horse to South Carolina; or is it for the Purpose of collecting Provisions & Forage before they proceed for New York; or can they flatter themselves with Conquest thro' any Assistance promised by the disaffected near the Head of the Bay, which Lord George Germaine alludes to in his Letter of the 7th of Feby. last to Sir Henry Clinton: If the latter was expected, or even the Recovery of their Prisoners at Lancaster or York-town, I should suppose Lord Cornwallis would have acted in Person. As soon as any thing more is known respecting this Movement I shall inform your Excellency of it.  I am, Sir, with the most respectful Attachment, Your Excellency's Most obedient humble Servant, Tho M:Kean President  ""

  Dear Sir. Philadelphia, 7t August 1781. When we arrived here we found the Business of Vermont in a manner Settled. A final Decision has been suspended in point of form in expectation of our Presence and we believe even of our Assent to the Recognition of the New State. All that passed last Winter at Albany had preceeded us, and made the Impression which may naturally be supposed. We therefore found it necessary to cut off all Enquiries, doubts and Expectations by communicating our Instructions which we did in the most solemn form by the Act of which we have the Honour to inclose your Excellency a Copy. (1) There are several Drafts on the Table for settling the Business each specifying or implying the Independance of Vermont. From the inclosed Paper containing Lord G Germains Letter to General Sir Henry Clinton, your Excellency will perceive the Progress some of the leading Men in that District have already made in a Coalition with the Enemy and the Danger of their extending their Encroachments and spreading Disaffection to our Cause. Those who were formerly most averse to a Decision are now active to promote it: but the Time is come when they can place their Principles on some Ground, and oppose Expediency and publick Safety to Justice and Right. This is a Theme fruitful of Reflection, but the Time presses and your Excellencys own Observations and we fear your own Feelings will supply our Brevity.  Every thing in our Power shall be exerted to obtain Security for our State beyond the Limits originally set up for the Grants, and preserve some Dignity in the Cession on the part of the United States.(2) AUGUST 7, 1781  There is reason to apprehend the Enemy are forming an Enterprise against Baltimore instead of their sending a Reinforcement to Sr. Henry Clinton. Preparations are making for their Reception. Lord Cornwallis seems to act the Part of a political Quack for the Ministry, he has felt the Pulse of the Inhabitants of Georgia, South & North Carolina and Virginia, and is convinced of their deep Aversion to any reunion with Great Brittain. Maryland remains to be tryed and this may be the Reason of his Visit. He will be enabled to make a Report to his Employers founded on experimental Knowledge. On no other Principles is his Conduct to be accounted for. We will not beleive that he could descend to be the Instrument of mere Vengeance and to conduct a War altogether predatory, and become the D'Alva of America! We beg your Excellency to beleive we shall do every thing in our Power to promote the Interest of our State tho' all our Hopes are cut off that the Instructions of the Legislature will be complyed with.  We have the Honour to be with the utmost Respect, sr, Your Excellencys most Obedient & very Humb Servt.  Jas. Duane Ezra LHommedieu ""

The repeal of the resolutions permiting the trafic of Bermuda with these States was the consequence of mature deliberation, and to prevent those abuses which had crept in under the indulgence, and would have been dishonorable in the States any longer to countenance.

  Aug. 10.1781 I am persuaded to believe that I have acknowledged the Receipt of your Favor of June 30th tho it is not so endorsed.(1) I think I recollect to have discovered my Unwillingness to persuade my dearest Friend my affectionate faithful generous-spirited Maria to put herself in the Way of a Meeting with a Stranger prejudiced against me and perhaps prompt to utter her Prejudices. I am sure such Ideas rose in my Mind when I first read your Wishes that I should urge an Acceptance of your Invitation, given I am sure, in unfeigned Politeness and pressed afterwards for a most benevolent Purpose. I thank you cordially for your kind Intentions. But I maintain my former Judgment of the Consequences. I hope you see enough of my Temper to prevent you from ever giving me the real Name of Cornelia or Clarinda or whatever C it was mentioned in one of yr. Letters, now in Boston. The good Opinion & Confidence of Mrs. L is one of the Chief of the very few Things that are to constitute my Happiness for the short years I may have to live.  I have made Communications to Mr. S. A.(2) if not to you that will answer all those Questions which you was restrained from asking thro' Fear of Rivington. I do really think that no Pique or ill Will against your Mr. A exists here. Whatever has been done that can excite a Suspicion of the Kind has sprung out of mistaken Principles of general Policy. I am not induced to suppose La Luzerne otherways than friendly & respectful; But when he has, agreably to what Vergennes wrote to him, desired Instructions to our Negotiator to act cordially & unreservedly with those of France, the Measures adopted here, in Consequence, have exceeded his Expectations.  I wish you not to suffer any Vexation of Mind beyond what I do myself. There is no such Idea here as any Criminality in Mr. A  AUGUST 10, 1781  he is much esteemed. But such is the uncouth way of Proceeding here at Times that unintended Chagrin must arise. Docr. F is experiencing very much I am persuaded on the Appointment of J Laurens. It is therefore that he has asked for Retirement rather than because of his age.  I am to acknowledge the Receipt of your very kind Epistle of July 14 recd. the 23d. Your Tenderness will betray you into an Indiscretion if you press your Friends as you proposed.(3) There has been a Disposition in the Court to make a Distinction in my Favor. They have done it in more Instances than one, without giving Offence to any of my Colleagues. I have no Right to complain beyond what the Rest have. A Batchelor or a Man with a very small Family can afford to serve. There are 3 of the former and 1 of the latter in our List. I know not Genl. Ward's Number. Those with many may refuse to accept when chosen.  I do not recollect what I have written to make you judge so severely of the Pittance. But be it what it may, it cannot be now altered. In short it is so involved in the Cloud of Calculation in the Case of Mr. Gerry who was 3 years here that I doubt whether any Member of the assembly can tell what has been given per day to the Delegates for their Time & Service, exclusive of Expences. It is a Fact that modest OEconomical Connecticutt has never given less than 3 Spanish or an Equivalent, from the first Congress till this day. It is my Mishap that I am not what your Ladyship maliciously, in Appearance, wished to call me-\""a practicing Attorney.\""  I really do not foresee how I am to begin the World at 42 without any of what are called the 3 learned Professions, without Farm or Stock for Trade; and yet if you will believe me I do not feel distressed, for, tho slandrous Females will speak slightly of my Morality I know that I am one of the most religious Men in the World. I am in perpetual Adoration of the Supreme who sent me into this State of Existence and who has given me the Will to labour. While he continues my Health therefore I can maintain more than one-especially on the other Side of the Alleghenny Mountains, near the Ohio.

  Sir, Philadelphia 10 August 1781. 1 O.Clk. Ev. The Letter which you did me the Honor to write of this date, (1) has surprized me infinitely more than the Subject which occasioned my Address to you of Yesterday's date; Can you suppose Sir, as a Gentleman of Honor and Sense that Explinations should have been sought on my part, into your Reserve, when I acted as a Legislator and you as a Party? I mean Sir, a Party of Interest, not with me. Good Heaven! Is America so abandoned to every Idea of Propriety as to admit that the first Councellors shall apologize to Applicants for a Refusal to their rejected Petitions? No Sir; Reflection will convince you that your Reserve was incompatible with every Idea of Candor; And that you should have opened the Subject to me, and not to my Colleague. If Sir, you grant \""the Propriety of the Principle,\"" mentioned in my Letter, why would you wish me to deviate in your behalf? You give the Reasons, by observing \""I have done it in other Instances.\"" Sir, I am obliged to say, you are mistaken in the Fact. But, otherwise, can my Acquiescence in adopting wrong Measures authorise the Propriety of your Misapplication, or justify me in protracting an Error? Pray Sir, if \""the Principle I lay down,\"" \""ought to be invariably pursued,\"" is it not as wrong in you as me to deviate from it? Your Application, or rather Advocation for a most partial Report, was a total Deviation from the general Principle, in which Principle, you, and every honest Man must agree; That I ever suffered this Principle to slip me \""in a Variety of Instances,\"" I utterly deny. Sir, I do not know of an Instance in which Depreciation has been allowed to the medical Staff, or any Individuals, during my being in Congress, who retired from Service previous to the Resolution of Congress allowing Depreciation To the Line at large. My growing cold therefore upon the Principle, is saying no more than that I was not vain enough to pursue unremittedly an improb[ab]le Object, to the Detriment of more important Concerns. \""That my Friend should be the first Victim to the Power of my Eloquence,\"" is a Suggestion at which my Heart relucts! \""Is my Friendship watchful to wound a Friend\""? Surely Sir, you did not AUGUST 10, 1781  consider the Force of your Expressions. To have called me knave Vilain, & Scoundrel, would have been more generous!  Here Sir, I must candidly declare, that I believe your Demand would have been acquiesced in, had it not been for my Opposition. I must lament, at the same Time, that a false Principle of personal Delacacy would have been the operating Cause! Shall it be said that a Member of Congress can receive Acknowledgements upon certain equitable Demands, to which Congress have not extended a general Principle? No. And I wish no greater Testimony than you will support at a more deliberative Moment. Your Claim Sir, did not rest upon \""extreme Hardships;\"" but upon Principles of Justice; And consequently, you must abandon the Principle in the private Pursuit. This I am sorry to say, as I can not believe you intentionally wrong; but must observe, that Friendship never will, can, or ought to induce a Gentleman \""whose Friendship has no Bounds,\"" to push his Friend upon the Point of Delicacy, beyond his Judgement. When Sir, you mention my \""attacking you,\"" you do me the greatest Injury. When you draw a Contrast forming Advantages, you little attend to generous Feelings; & when you speak of Victory, \""fatal to you,\"" you stab me directly, and in the tenderest part. Be assured, Sir, that instead of\""Victory,\"" I obtained the most mortifying Reflection in my Life, that I was bound in Honor, Conscience and Virtue to oppose my best of Friends, in what I thought the most improper Demands. \""In your Absence\""? Had your Application been made upon any just rational Principles, you could not have been present at all; As you became a voter in your own particular Cause; or, prevented the Representation of a State-But, you spoke in your own Cause, under the Previlidges of a Legislator, And retired after I began to oppose the Report of the Committee. It is therefore assuming too much, when you insinuate that your Retiring should have caused my Acquiescence in a Measure that my Soul disapproved. I fear Sir, I have been too tedious upon a Subject, on which your Letter convinces me your Enmities are too deeply formed. Human Nature has its Errors. I think your Nature so good upon the great Scale, that I firmly believe you have displayed its darkest Shades in this Transaction. And notwithstanding I feel myself greatly injured, without a real Cause, I must persuade myself that your Conclusions are more the Result of accidental Causes, than from an original, habitual or intentional Malignity. Whatever may be your Conduct respecting me, I shall not forget how much the public is indebted to you; Your excellent Qualities and Capacity to render future Services. I shall neglect no Opportunity of impartially serving you, but must ever withhold from you, as I would from the highest Angell in Heaven, a Sacrifice of my Judgement. The cold, the collateral manner in which you mention the Time of your Departure, denies me the Honor of waiting upon you, as I intended, a few  AUGUST 11, 1781  Miles into the Country. Should it be convenient, I flatter myself, you will call upon Mrs. Varnum.

  Revd & Dr Sir (1) Philadelphia Aug 11th 1781 The hurry of the present Oppertunity suffers me to do no more than barely to relate the News of the Day. An Express this Morning from Genl Green advises (2)-That the Genl. on hearing of Lord Rawdons approach with a superior Force, thought it prudent to raise the Siege of Fort 96 & retire before him. The pursuit lasted two Days but in vain. His Lordship returned to 96, and after leaving a reinforcemt there, fell down to the Congarees, a Country abounding in Provisions. The General desirous of reinvesting 96 crossed the Country to dislodge Lord Rawdon from this advantageous Post. This unexpected Maneuver, not pleasing the british Commander, he retired with Marks of great precipitancy to Orangeburgh, with no other Loss than a few baggage Waggons, and being there reinforced with the whole Garrison of 96, evacuated for this Purpose. General Green contented himself with laying before the Post and detaching Genl. Marian (who had now joined him with 1000 Men) & Coll Lee with his Legion to surprize Monks Corner in the Neighbourhood of Charles Town, or by the Maneuvre to draw Lord Rawdon out of Orangeburgh.  Coll Lee on the way sent Capt. Eggleston with a few Troop of Horse to annoy the british Cavalry then foraging in the Country. AUGUST 11, 1781  The Capt fortunately passed them unperceived & gained 3 Miles in their front-where discovered, being taken for Militia Horse, were charged with great fury. The Capt received it, with that determined Bravery that has distinguished that fortunate Corps. He brought off a Capt., Lieut., Cadet & 45 Men & Horses with Accoutrements Compleat. They then proceeded to Monks Corner from whence Genl Green had not heard from them on the 17th July.  We have had advice from Charles Town that they succeeded at Monks Corner, & were within 3 & 4 Miles of the Town-and it is said that Orangeburgh is evacuated & the Garrison retired to Charles Town. If this is true, the British have no Post in Georgia, the two Carolinas & Virginia except the Towns of Savanna, Charles Town & Portsmouth.

No body is better pleased with your Promotion to the office of Secretary for foreign affairs than his Lady. It is on her Hint that I mention that there is a house opposite to Mr Morris's intended Residence. Mr John Allen once occupied it-to be sold for £1500 Spec. & £40 per An. ground rent. It is reckond cheap as it woud rent for about £200 per An. It is large enough for your family conveniently & healthfully situated; Conveniently because it is near the State house, Financier's, & French ministers-Healthily because it is in a high & open part of the Town. If you have any thoughts of the purchase, Expedition will be necessary. There seems little doubt but you may always get what is now demanded for it. If it can be avoided do not rely on hiring as people among all their Exorbitancies excell in Imposition on the Article of Rent. \""If you like your House or can't get another it is a Rule here that you are to be raised.\"" Mrs. Livingston's Comfort will be much promoted by the  AUGUST 11, 1781  neighbourhood of Mrs. Morris, as she has no Friend who will pay her more attention. She interests herself deeply in your making the purchase as she assured me this morning at Breakfast.  It is reported that Col. Lee has taken of the Enemy's light horse near Charlestown S.C by one of the Maneuvres for which he is so celebrated. I hope it will be confirmed. We have no late news from Europe. This is in a great measure Ascribable to the want of a proper Channel of Intelligence which after much Solicitude & pains I see at length established in your person.  If I can procure the Establishment of our remaining Limits by express bound & under a special Guarantee of the united States my labour will not be in Vain, & I shall return home with great Satisfaction. The Doctrine that our Jurisdiction over Vermont is to be sacrificed for the Publick Tranquility is pretty fully established. What happend in the Legislature at Albany last winter preceeded us: & it was even expected that we came prepared to execute a Surrender. We were not however deterred from doing our Duty agreably to Our express Instructions. We are endeavouring To avail ourselves of the Advantages which may arise by the Impressions which this Determination, only Justified by the plea of necessity, must create.  Make my Affectionate Respects acceptible to those whom you & I love-and believe me to be-with very great Regard, Dear Sir, Your Affectionate & most Obedt Servt. Jas. Duane  ""

  Dear sr.(1) Philadelphia August 11. 1781. Before you receive this, you will in all probability hear of the Determination of Congress in respect to Vermont. They have appointed a Committee to confer with Agents to be appointed from the New Hampshire Grants & sent here, on the Terms of their being admitted into the Union, in case Congress should conclude to acknowledge their Independance. We found on our arrival a general Disposition to enter on this measure, which has taken Effect. Those that had been most averse to deside on this matter, were now the most forward to bring it on. I have not Time, to inform you of the motives that induced different States to adopt this Measure, but shall only observe, that the Conduct of the Legislature at Albany last winter has had all the Effect here, that could be wished for, by the advocates for the Independance of Vermont. Should the New Hamshire Grants East of Connecticut River be admitted into the Union, I think it Would be a favorable oppertunity to Obtain a  AUGUST 11, 1781  Guarantee for the remaining part of the state, which object we shall not lose sight of. Mr. Chancellor Livingston was yesterday choosen Secretary for foreign affairs with a Handsome Sallery of about 1500 lbs per annum.(2) This is an important officer, and ought long ago to have been filled, but has necessary been vacant, as no Person beforee has had a majority of Votes. I am Sorry for the State in the Loss of Mr Livingstons Abilities. We have no News more than Colo Livinston can inform you of & you will have in the inclosed Paper. Living in this City is very disagreable this Season of the year on Acct. of the Heat, and exceeding expensive. Board for Man & Servant above 5 lbs per Week, Ho[r]se Keeping 2/9 per Day, washing about 16/, which with pocket Expences, and a Number of et Ceteras, will at least take our Allowances granted by the State. Nothing passes here but hard Money, and the high Prises is occationed by the large importation of hard Money from the Havannah, in a Short Time amounting to one million of Dollers or more. 'Tis said House Rent is higher here than in the City of London.  I gave directions to Grenell respecting the Things you wanted, but have not heard from him since I left Home. If there should be any disappointment, I shall have it in my power at any Time to answer the Ballance due to you. With Regards to Mrs Tayler and the Little Ones, I am with great respect, Your most obedt Sevt,  Ezra LHommedieu P.S.

  My dear Brother, (1) Philadelphia Augt. 12, 1781 I write this barely to communicate the important News of the Day. Genl. Greene by a Variety of well judged Maneuvres, which do him honor, after Lord Rawdon had obliged him in Prudence to raise the Siege of fort 96, in his turn obliged his Lordship to evacuate that important fortress, abandon his strong Post on the Congarees (a Country abounding with Provisions) and fall down to Orangeburgh about 80 Miles from Charles Town. Here Genl Green detached Genl Marian with the Militia & Coll Lee's Legion to surprize the Post at Monks Corner 20 Miles from Charles Town. On their Way Coll Lee sent Capt. Eggleston with a few Troop of Horse to annoy the Enemy's Cavalry, then foraging in the Country. The Capt. passed them unpercieved and gained 3 Miles in their Front & when discovered was taken for Militia Horse. The Enemy came out in an irregular loose Body and was recieved by Capt. Eggleston with AUGUST 12, 1781  Judgmt & Bravery. Lee's Words are \""They were soon routed, dispersed & Cut to pieces\""-except a Capt., Lieut., Cadet, 45 Men & Horses with Accoutrements compleat brought off Prisoners and one Man of the Whole escaped to be a living Evidence of the Fact. By a Flag from Charles Town we are informed that we succeeded also at Monks Corner.  A Vessel just this Moment from Cadiz announces the Capture & arrival in France of the whole Statia Fleet with their Convoy-also the Capture & arrival at Cadiz [of] 5 English India Men.(2) I forgot to tell [you] that there has been a Mutiny among the English Troops at Carolina, in quelling of which 100 Men were killed & wounded.

  Sir, Private. Philadelphia. August 12. 1781. By a vessel from Cadiz last night we are informed, that our Minister at the Spanish court, as late as the 11th June, (1) had made but little progress in a negociation with them; they still appear friendly, but aim at cessions we cannot make; they give encouragement respecting money at sometimes, again they are disappointed and cannot promise any thing certain; they have however given Mr. Jay liberty to accept Bills to the amount of One hundred and fifty thousand Dollars, but have no known funds appropriated for the payment. In short their conduct appears rather insincere and mysterious. Our public dispatches are intercepted; or obstructed in so much, that a free correspondence is almost impracticable. Mr. Cardoqui was to sett off from Madrid for Philadelphia sometime in June; but his intentions of coming here have been so often announced, and the delay not accounted for, that Mr. Jay will say nothing about him hereafter, until he has actually sailed.  France acts a truly friendly part. We shall certainly obtain from her, this year, twenty millions of livres; four of which will be retained for Doctor Franklin, to discharge the interest on Loan-Office Certificates; two supplied in military stores &c. and the residue be subject to the directions of Congress. I have the strongest reasons to believe that Colonel Laurens is now on the Ocean, and has with him two millions and an half of this money in specie: I pray most sincerely for his safe arrival.  AUGUST 12, 1781  It is yet more than probable, that there will be a negociation for a general peace some time this Fall: the Congress to assemble at Vienna. France has proposed that the United States of America shall have a Minister or Ministers Plenipotentiary at the Congress: The Emperor is afraid this proposition may obstruct a measure he has much at heart; it has been suggested, that if the United States are heared by Memorial it would probably answer; but to this France does not seem to consent. The Emperor was expected in June or July at Paris on a visit-The probable consequence of which is yet in dubio.  Sweden and Denmark have refused to assist the Dutch with Ships of War; Russia is undecided. Count Panin, the Prime Minister of Russia, is removed. Mr. Neckar's resignation has been accepted by His Most Christian Majesty; this great Character was not agreeable to the court of Spain, nor to the Officers at Versailles; he is said to have conducted with too much Hauteur.  Out of Admiral Rodney's thirty four Ships, laden with the plunder of St. Eustatia, Monsieur Piquet has certainly captured twenty four; and it is said, that five more have been picked up by Privateers; the Escort, consisting of a 74, one 64 and two Frigates, with five of the convoy, escaped by their swiftness in sailing.  An expedition was in great forwardness at Cadiz, to consist of eight sail of the line besides frigates &c. and eight or ten thousand Land-forces; the destination unknown. They were to sail in July, and conjectured to be for the West-Indies or this Continent.  By a letter from the Marquis La Fayette of the 6th from Pamunky we have intelligence, that Lord Cornwallis, with the Fleet formerly mentioned, and an addition of Whale-boats, carrying the greatest part of the British Army, have arrived in York river, and landed at Gloucester and York-town, which they now occupy.(2) Your Excellency is probably acquainted with their situation; however the Marquiss describes the one to be a small neck projected into the river; the other surrounded by the river and a Morass. Genl. O'Hara commands at Portsmouth.  The Honorable Robert R. Livingston was appointed by Congress, on Friday last, Secretary for foreign affairs.  Georgia has re-established her Government, and South Carolina is expected to be soon in capacity to do the same.  I am, Sir, with the most respectful attachment, Your Excellency's Most obedient humble Servant, Tho M:Kean  ""

The Enemy must become weaker every day, and we shall certainly grow stronger; we are at present very low, with respect to finance, but it is with infinite pleasure I can inform you, that we have very fair prospects on that head from abroad as well as at home. France has lately given further proof, that she is a faithfull Ally: I cannot be more particular. Spain continues to act an interested and mysterious part, but must in the end close with us.

This measure he had complained of to Congress as attended with many abuses, and particularly dangerous to be pursued while the intended operations should be carrying on against New York-which induced Congress to come to an advisory resolve upon the matter, a copy of which we herewith inclose. We wish however, for their fuller information on so interesting a subject, that they had had the benefit of your Excellency's letter, and shall yet lay it before them.(1)  Your Excellency will have received two letters written circular to the States by the Superintendent of finance, solliciting the grant of the 5 per Cent. duties heretofore recommended by Congress, and pressing for a speedy adjustment of the accounts of supplies and other disbursements made by the States.(2) Both of which requests it appears to us of much importance to the public and especially the interest of our State, should be complied with.  We enclose for your Excellency's perusal a late act of Congress respecting Vermont-preparing the way for recognizing her independance, and her admission into the Union. The States of New York and New Hampshire embarrassed and alarmed of late with the increasing claims of this people, have been very pressing for a decission, and there is reason to expect they will acquiesce in the measure now adopted.  Our affairs, at this time, to the Southward appear to be gaining strength. General Greens support from the Country, which he is now able to protect, increases. Civil government is reestablishing in Georgia and expected soon to be in South Carolina. Lord Cornwallis yet remains in Virginia, but the force collected under the Marquis La Fayette has been able of late to cover the Country from his ravages.  Letters have just been received from Mr. Jay at Madrid, but they do not communicate any thing of special importance. One, of a later date, from Mr. Carmichal his secretary, (3) mentions, as a matter he was convinced of from information he had obtained, that a demand from the Court of France to that of Vienna, that an American Commissioner should be admitted at the proposed Congress for a general pacification, was acceded to; but that it does not yet appear when or where this Congress will be held. An Embarkation of eight  AUGUST 14, 1781  or ten thousand troops, equipped at great expence, was on the point of taking place from Spain, conjectured to be against Minorca. By various accounts from Europe it appears that most of the Statia fleet are captured and carried into France.  The honourable Robert R. Livingston Esquire Chancellor of the State of New York is appointed by Congress Secretary of foreign affairs.  We hope some one or more of our Delegates will soon arrive and take their seats in Congress, as they have been wrote to for that purpose some time since, and Mr. Ellsworth, on account of his health and the circumstances of his family and affairs, expects shortly to return home.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia, 14th August 1781. At a Juncture so interesting your Excellency will be anxious for Intelligence. I shall with pleasure communicate every material Occurrance, sometimes at the hazard of uncertainty; & as I have no time nor Assistance to copy, of Repetition. I know your goodness will induce you to make every proper Allowance.  The most material is a Confirmation of a former Account that  about 2000 Hessians & Anspachers had embarked from England for these States most probably for Charles Town. The British House of Commons overruled Hartley's late motion for peace Ayes 72, No's 106.(1) The gallant L. Col. Lee by a fine maneuvre lately surrounded & took 1 Capt, 2 Sub's & 45 privates of the british Dragoons, compleatly accouterd, near Monk's Corner about 30 miles from Charles Town. Rawdon complains that he never was so watched as AUGUST 14, 1781  by Lee for he can take no position for a single night in which he is not assaulted by him on his weakest side. The probability is that all the British Troops will soon be confined to Charles Town. In Virginia affairs have taken a new Turn. That part of Cornwallis's Army which was supposed to be destined for New York & had been some days on ship board debarked And are Occupied in fortifying from York to Gloster about 16 miles from Williamsburgh. The French have taken 24 Sail of the St. Eustatia plunder on the passage to England. The Value unascertaind; perhaps the English have triumphed too soon. If they loose their ill gotten gains and it passes into the hands of France, besides the indelible disgrace of the Invasion and the unheard of Rapacity & barberity of the Conquerors, they must suffer the Mortification of Arming their Enemy in a war-in no small degree-of Finance.  Of the 1500 men which not long since were said to have arrived at Charles Town 100 were lately killed in a mutiny. They alleged that they enlisted not as Soldiers but Settlers. Great Numbers too perished by an hasty march which they were compelled to undertake on their landing to relieve 96. Rawdon is reported to be ill at Charles Town. A Gentleman lately from thence says he was escorted thither by a Troop of Horse which as well as their Riders looked like Scarecrows.  The Combined fleets it is said have blocked up the British squadron in the Channell.  The great Financier Neckar is displaced: owing it is said to his Obstinacy and Haughteur: more probably to Envy and Entreague. There may however be better Reasons for it: as far as we can Judge so wise an administration as the French Cabinet coud not have parted with so great a minister unless there was a Substantial Cause.  A Valuable prize loaded with window glass, Cordage, Bar, &c. &c. is now in this River taken by the Rising Sun, privateer of this port. She was bound from Bristol to our Capital: one of her invoices amounts to £14,000 Sterling.  The Affairs which immediately respect our own State remain as they were when we had last the Honour of addressing your Excellency.  With affectionate regards to Mrs. Clinton & the Family, I have the Honour to be, Dear Sir, Your Excellency's most Affectionate & most Obedient humble serv't, Jas. Duane.  P.S. We find ourselves instructed by the Legislature to press the Settlement of Col. Hay's Accounts, and an advance to our Artificers &c. But we have no Information or Materials respecting the Accounts on which to ground a Representation And as to money, the Current Service calls for more than can be drawn into the publick Treasury. We have written Col. Hay to this Effect.(2) We have the Capitulation of Tobago which surrendered to Count DeGrasse on the 2nd of June 1781.(3) The Terms do honour to the Magnanimity of   our Ally. Every possible Indemnification & Indulgence are granted to the Inhabitants. What a Contrast between the two rival Nations! The French seem determined to raise the Contrast between themselves & their Enemy as high and to render it as striking as possible. What Glory will they acquire by their Humanity! Exercised too in the face of the Example of St. Eustatia.  Since writing what preceeds a Letter is read in Congress from Fay, Allen & Woodward enclosing their Commissions from Vermont to enter into Alliance with the United States. I suppose the Treaty will be immediately opend as they are upon the Spot and Congress seem to have got over All Objections to their Gratification.(4) How we shall act I know not. If their agents shoud be admitted to take Seats as Delegates, can we continue not knowing the Sense of our own State? I sincerely wish it was the 10th of September to rid me of this Embarrassment.(5) ""

  Sir, Philadelphia, August the 14th. 1781 By a letter of yesterday, (1) the Delegates of Georgia Acknowledged the favor you honore'd them with, on the 17th ultimo. Your Exertions for the preservation of the Southern States and, of that in particular which I have the honor to represent, inspire me with Sentiments of pleasure and gratitude. Indeed the Success which has attended you under accumulated difficulties and the Judgment displayed by you, to save the remains of an army, when you first took the command, and to conduct it to victory since, must justly intitle you to the reputation of an experienced General, and fasten you in the affection of those virtuous citizens who are restored under your auspices to freedom & independence. I hope our Georgians will proceed to cover their State with law & government and whilst they adopt every necessary measure for the defence of our much love'd country: the blessings of civil liberty will be Seen to Smile throughout every part of the State.  And indeed never was it more necessary than at present-that government should be Established-by letters which arrived to congress this very morning we are further assured that negotiations for a general pacification will soon take place.(2) France contended as a preliminary, that the united States should have a representative at  AUGUST 14, 1781  the proposed Congress of the belligerent powers-a private letter from the Secretary of the Embassy at Madrid imports that Russia & the Emperor will accede to the proposition. There cannot be a doubt but England will endeavour to offer a pretence of conquest with a view to having the two Southern States ceded to her, and covered as her armies in that Quarter, are with disgrace and defeat: her pride, falsehood and Spirit of misrepresentation will bear her up on the occasion but her imagery must give way to a State of facts which you and the gallant troops under your command have furnished the ministers of your Country with to oppose to her demands.  I expect every day another delegate of our State to arrive. His coming will facilitate my wishes of returning to Georgia. The arrival of the fleet of our allies can alone Enable our Excellent general to make a full impression on New York. Should this circumstance (as is hourly expected) take place, and that you could at the Same time receive some effectual Supplies, I would not entertain a doubt of Seeing the issue of this campaign; crowned with the independence of a chain of the most rising and commercial republics the World Ever beheld.

  Dear Sir Philada. August 14. 1781. Genl Sullivan set out for Newhampshire on Saturday last with Mr Smith and my son George. The chevalier followd on Sunday. By Genl Sullivan you will be fully informed abt Vermont, he has a copy of the resolution of Congress on that head. Every reasonable argument was used to have the territory annexed to N.H. but in vain. An act of Massachusets to relinquish their right & make a new state led the way. Altho we know they had no right: but it gave colour & influence. Congress had also good information that the body of the people in NYork were willing to do the same, their house of repres[entati]ves voted it. The fear of Vermont joyning the Brittish, according to Lord Geo Germaines, intercepted letter; and also the fear of a civil war, in case of attempting to reduce them to N Y or N H. by force, had doubtless some weight. All these motives joyned induced congress to yield to motives of policy & expedience rather than rigid J_____e. (1) The point now to be followed by N H is to get the grants east of the river well established under their government. This point I hope and expect will not be opposed by those amongst ourselves that did not wish N.H. to extend west of the river. If this were gaind, & the County of Grafton made active, Newhampshire might be a happy state. I should think myself happy, could I effect so much of this as is to be done in congress, before I leave it.  You know, Sir, that my appointment as delegate stands good till the 18th Jany next; but I should be happy to return in the fall, for the sake of ease in the journy. I wish therefore the court to appoint two delegates for one year, from the first of November, this will bring the business into a proper channell. If this were done, the way would be open for me to return in Octor.(2) And I hope we shall have done with Vermont before that time. If these sentiments should be agreable to you & to the Honble court, to whome this letter may be communicated; This may be considered as a request from me for leave to return. However, I beg your free & candid opinion upon the point: and intend to comply intirely with the pleasure of the court.  A vessell arived here on Sunday from Cadiz by which we are informed that 24 of 34 of the fleet that carried off the Eustatia plunder were captured by the French fleet, and carried into France-that 5 English East indiamen were carried into Spain. Other important good news by said vessell in dispatches to Congress I must suppress for the present.  I have this day drawn on you for a £100 lawfull in favour of Mr. John Pringle to whom I am under obligation for purchasing the bills, payable in Boston at 40 days sight. This 40 days, with 3 weeks notice I have given you in my letter of the 24 July, makes the two months, according to the vote of the Court. AUGUST 14, 1781  If you had an opertunity to consult genl Sullivan abt a plan for saving expense in the delegation between this & next spring, which he and I have talked over, and which we find has been adapted by some other states with success, it might be worth making the experiment.

  Dear Sir Philada. Augst. 14th. 1781 I have your favor of the 6th inst. before me.(1) The defect of intelligence from your correspondents here must have been removed soon after you wrote, unless a miscarriage befell my letter as well as that of Mr. Jones who wrote the week before by the intercepted mail.(2) Such accidents or sickness will in future I presume alone interrupt our interchange of news which is once more settled into a regular channel.  We were exceedingly disappointed & chagrined to find the movements of the Enemy which had so much occupied the public conjectures terminate in a relanding in Virginia, which has surely had an ample share of their visitations. This event is the more to be lamented, as it seems to indicate either that the combined operations  AUGUST 14, 1781  agst. N.Y. are viewed without apprehensions by the Enemy, or that some unexpected succour is on its way to them. The latter is given out at N. York, and even the former is rendered but too probable by the languor with which the States supply the Commander in chief with the necessary means of success.  A Vessel just arrived from Cadiz confirms the agreeable report of the recapture of the fleet bound to England with Rodney's plunder, by the French. 20 at least if not 24 out of about 30 are certainly secured. The same Vessel also confirms the disagreeable report of the removal of Mr. Necker from his important office. The cause of this unexpected event is not yet unveiled to us. Some of those little intrigues which prevail more or less in all Courts and which are often at the bottom of occurrences which are imputed to profound reasons of State, have most probably supplanted him. The remaining article of news by this arrival is that 8 or 10,000 troops with a competent naval force would soon embark at Cadiz on a secret expedition. This fact is sufficiently authenticated to us. Minorca among other places is talked of as the object in contemplation.  A Vessel is also just come up from the W. Indies. Her intelligence relates merely to the arrival of the 4 french ships which were at the Havannah, at Hispaniola in order to join the whole fleet which was expected there.(3) As the Hurricane Months were just at hand, it is not improbable that this rendevouz was meant as a preliminary to some extra operation, Whether Europe or elsewhere will be the scene of it, it does not belong to me to say. Mr. Rivington in a late paper tells us that a large number of American Pilots were not long since collected at Rhode Island & carried to the W. Indies and infers that Degrass meditated a junction with the French Squadron on our Coast. I wish he may guess right although he tells us at the same time that all such designs will be frustrated by the precautions taken on the other side.  The controversy relating to the district called Vermont the inhabitants of which have for several years claimed & exercised the jurisdiction of an Independent State is at length put into a train of speedy decision. Notwithstanding the objections to such an event, there is no question but they will soon be established into a separate & federal State. A relinquishment made by Massachusetts of her claims, a despair of finally obtaining theirs on the part of N. Y. and N. H. the other claimants, on whom these enterprizing Adventurers were making fresh encroachments, the latent support afforded them by the leading people of the N. E. States in general from which they emigrated, the just ground of apprehension that their rulers were engaging in clandestine negociations with the enemy, & lastly perhaps the jealous policy of some of the little States wch. hope that such a precedent may engender a division of some of the large ones,  are the circumstances which will determine the concurrence of Congress in this affair. With very sincere regard I am Dr. Sir Yr. obt. & humble Servant, J . Madison Junr.  Mr. Jones desires me to mention to you that he omitted sending his letter by the last post, and that will therefore only receive it at the time you do this.  ""

  Dear sir, Philadelphia Augt. 14. 1781 I received your favor of the 18th Ulto. a few days ago, for which I am much obliged to you. I hope long 'ere this Govr. Rutledge is with you. The Gentlemen from St. Augustine are all safe arrived here, as likewise, are those from Chs. Town. None of them will remain here, one hour longer than is indispensibly necessary; as soon as they can get their families accommodated in such manner, as to place them beyond absolute want, they have all agreed to set out immediately for their own country. For this purpose, the Delegates of So. Carolina are negotiating a loan of 30,000 Dollars, & have applied also, to the generously disposed to contribute by their donations to the relief of these distressed, & magnanimous people. We have met with great success in both applications, & am in hopes to administer such relief to them, as will render their situations comfortable., tho' not affluent.(1) I have great expectations from their arrival in their own country. They are mostly men of the first fortune, & influence there, & will be able to give the Governor such substantial support, as will be productive of the most happy effects. The re-establishing of civil government in that country, is of the utmost consequence, in the present situation of our affairs. I keep my eye constantly towards the manuvreings in Europe: it is on that theatre America's fate must finally be fixed. I expect nothing from their present negotiations (indeed it is a doubt with me whether any will be entered upon during the present campaign). The period for the great & serious business to be opened, will be at the conclusion of this campaign; for should a Congress be previously held, it is natural to suppose the demands of the parties will be so wild & extravagant, as must render them totally inadmissable on either side. It is therefore the events of  AUGUST 14, 1781  this campaign alone, that can bring them to treat upon any rational terms. This observation applies most forcibly to Great Britain. Should she be successful, her outrageous ambition, will lead her to the most insolent demands; if the reverse, or if she should be able to gain nothing, they will most probably be moderate; & open a fair field for discussion; & under the direction of impartial Mediators, holds up the prospect of an equitable determination of all disputes. The Empress of Russia, in particular, has this business much at heart; she wishes for the glory of being peculiarly instrumental in terminating a war, that has made so much noise in the world, & which if further prosecuted, bids fair to throw the four quarters of the globe into a flame, and emulous of the great renown already gained by the Young King, our generous ally, she wishes for an participation of that fame, by contributing her aid in behalf of the rights of mankind. From the interposition of this Great Princess much is to be expected. Whilst the dispute between Britain & the Dutch subsists, she must be more the foe, than the friend of Britain. This induced the latter so earnestlly to call in the Emperor as a Co-mediator, well knowing the engagements between Russia, & Holland, to be of such a nature, as would oblige the former to favor the demands of the latter, at least so far as they were equitable: knowing at the same time, how flagrant a violation of the laws of neutrality she had been guilty of, & the humiliating circumstances she must be reduced to, if obliged to make restitution & if either her insolence, or inability, should incline her to a refusal, convinced that she must draw another most formidable enemy upon her; all these considerations, must render the Empress a powerful advocate for a general pacification, & dispose Britain to think more seriously of it, than ever she has yet done. Some of these observations seem to militate against the Idea of the Empress's being an impartial Mediator. But when it is considered, that Britain knew of the engagement between Russia, & Holland, before she attacked the latter, & that she must have done it at this hazard of engaging in a war with Russia, yet, that Russia has forborne commencing hostilities against her, but rather wishes for an amicable adjustment of the differences between her ally & Britain, & Britain having herself accepted her proffered mediation, I think the Idea of partiality cannot apply to her, but must at once be reprobated.  This political state of affairs, calls loudly on America for great, & powerful exertions, that we might be placed in such a situation at the close of this campaign, as to appear on the stage of negotiation with respectibility & thereby be enabled to support our claims, with becoming firmness, & rid them of the former charge of extravagance. Above all things, we should be prepared to counteract, & in a situation to kick to the devil, their damnable claim of uti possidetis; the bare possession of two or three Sea port towns in the different  States, will shew Britain the nullity of such a claim, as to themselves & the inadmissibility of it, on the part of generous Mediators.(2)  ""

  Sir, Philadelphia 14th August 1781.  The Super-Intendent of Finance has lately written circular Letters to the States;(1) Their Contents have been approved by Congress. We  AUGUST 14, 1781  are at a loss to conjecture the Reasons wch. have induced the State of Rhode Island to delay complying with the Requisition of Congress respecting the five per Cent Duty. This Requisition was so essential to the Adoption of a regular, frugal and productive System of Finance, that we cannot enter into the necessary Details of a permanent Revenue without realizing it. It must be obvious that unless we can call forth the Resources of the respective States equally it will be impossible to execute any great Object, while the States who do most will be the greatest Sufferers. It is as obvious that without a permanent Revenue in the Disposal of the United States, we can neither fulfill past Ingagements nor obtain future Credit. The Resources of the Country are not sufficient to carry on the War, without anticipating the Revenues. This cannot be done Without Credit, nor this exist without Funds.  We have not a Doubt but Matters will soon be put into such a Train as to settle the public Accounts on equitable Principles. Measures are taking by Congress to enable the Financier to adopt such Modes, as will do justice to all the States, & remove those unhappy Consequences wch. result from a mutual Jealousy. We must therefore beg Liberty urge the Propriety of the Measures, & a Compliance with them.  The Congress have appointed a Committee of five to confer with a Committee to be appointed from the State of Vermont, and agree upon Terms for admitting them into the Union. Three Gentlemen have arrived from Vermont 'tho' in Consequence of Powers granted by that State previous to the Resolution of Congress.(2) Our latest Advices from General Greene gives Matters a much more favorable Complexion in the Southern Department than could have been expected.

  Philadelphia 18th August 1781. Questions proposed by the committee of Congress to the Agents on the part of Vermont, with the Agents answers annexed.(1)  Question 1. Are the boundaries set forth in the written propositions delivered in by the said Agents (2) at this time claimed by the State of Vermont as the lines of jurisdiction the same as contained in the resolution of Congress of the 7th of August instant?(3) Answer. They are the same with the addition of part of the waters of Lake Champlain for the benefit of trade &Ca.  Question 2d. What part do the people of Vermont mean to take as to the past expences of the present war, and what aid do they propose to afford as to Men and money to the common defence?  Answer. Such proportion as shall be mutually judged equitable after their admission to a seat in Congress which has been at several different times officially proposed by Agents on the part of Vermont.  Question 3d. What are the ideas of the people of Vermont relative to the claim of private property under grants or patents from New Hampshire or New York previous to the present revolution?  Answer. Although the Legislature of Vermont hath not hitherto authorized any court to take cognizance of such causes as respect titles of lands; nevertheless they have had and still have it in contemplation to adopt such modes as the circumstances arising out of each case may justify, without adhereing to the strict rules of Law.  AUGUST 18, 1781  Question 4. What are the intentions of your constituents with regard to those patents that were granted on condition of settlement within a given time, and which have been prevented by the claims of the people of Vermont and the present revolution?  Answer. No forfeitures have been taken by the State of Vermont on any such grants for a non-performance of conditions of settlement, and we concieve it to be the intention of our constituents to grant a further reasonable time for fulfilling such conditions.  Question 5th. What are the number of inhabitants within the lines mentioned in their propositions above-mentioned?  Answer. The citizens of Vermont have not been lately numbered-we can therefore only estimate them at about thirty thousand, which we concieve to be nearly a true estimate.  Question 6th. What quantity of land is contained within the said bounds?  Answer. There has been no accurate survey of the State of Vermont; but we concieve it to contain about five millions of acres.  Question 7th. What applications have been made either publickly or privately by the enemies of the United States or their adherents to draw off the people of Vermont from their affection to the United States of America?  Answer. The honorable committee are possessed of copies of Beverly Robinson's letters enclosed in Brigadier General Allen's letter of the ninth of March last to the then President of Congress (4) any private offers we cannot avouch for.  Question 8th. In case the enemy should attempt an invasion of the northern frontiers what aid as to men and provisions could be raised in the State of Vermont for the public defence. You can suppose the invasion made in different quarters-and within what time?  Answer. The number of militia within the lines herein limited we suppose to consist of about seven thousand-are in general well armed and accoutred, and have ever shewn themselves spirited in case of alarms &c. In regard to provisions the country is fertile but new, and considerable emigrations from other States in Vermont. The Legislature at their session in October last levied a tax on the inhabitants for provisions sufficient for victualing one thousand five hundred troops in the field for twelve months, And we are of opinion a larger store may be in the same manner collected the ensuing autumn.(5)  ""

Of the 23d of May and 17th of July, with the Jeu's d'sprits came safe to hand together, and the bearer of them has honord me with his AUGUST 20, 1781  presence once, had not the bright Eyes of a fair Quaker intercepted him on the Road (for she lives between here & Philadelphia) I shd. probably been oftener honord with his Compts. My Utmost efforts have been tried to procure a Tutor for the boys but in vain. I almost thought I had succeeded the other day in interceeding for a Gentn. (Refugee Clergyman) from Chas. Town-but that prospect is I believe Vanishd. I shall however persevere. I feel much for their welfare & shall leave no stone unturnd to promote it. Your Fairy hill is much admired; it wd. make a good Burletta-& were I able I shd. have it set to Musick and performd in my Salon but alas my Imagination Soars sometimes aloft, & is soon twitchd down by that little shabby dirty fellow poverty. But my Friend is it not Strange that, nor you, nor any Friend I have can inform me of the Exact Situation of my affairs in Amelia & at Farmindell. Since the Enemy were there, what is lost-or what is saved, eight or ten weeks have Elapsed and all that I have heard about them is what Fanny has given me from report. This is a Cruel Suspence. Can I be informed whether my Tobo. was sold before the warehouses were burnt, or not, whether all my Negroes or only a part have gone off-whether I have lost all my stocke, house hold furniture &c. &c. &c. These are to me interesting topics-they must be known to my Friends in Virginia and yet none of them except as above mentioned have thought it worth while to write me a tittle on the Subject. The news of Sr. George Rodneys St. Eustatia fleet to the tune of twenty five being safe arrived at Brest is confirmd beyond Contradiction-we are in hourly Expectation of the French fleet from the West Indies on our Coast; under the Count de Grasse (who has Certainly taken Tobago) but of this desireable event I only speak from Conjecture and not with Certainty; every days experience teaches me not be be Sanguine in expectation. I have put Dr. Oliphant who is here in the way to procure yr. Brothers (2) Pay as soon as the Finances are in a Condition to do it. I hope I may congratulate you on his safe arrival in Virginia as we are informed he was destined for that State with the Invalids of Chas Town Garrison who are Exchanged-in consequence of that Information I enclosed him a letter in mine to Fanny from a friend of his in Chas Town which Mr. Harleston put into my hands. You may inform him that Cong. has come to a resolution to make up the depreciation to the Medical Staff of the Army and that he will receive the full Value of his pay when the treasury is in Condition to pay it. You complain of the Maladministration of Public affairs in Virginia. I hear there is too much reason for so doing but in the same of good Sense why do not those whose ability, and integrity can be depended on stand forth, and enter into the Councils and active departments of Government, and give it that Vigor and energy which it wants. Do you expect that the Important machine of government can be worked by --------- ex ligno Qui fit   Mercurius.(3) Complaints are Idle. While Gentn. & men of abilities think themselves disgraced by being raised to posts of honor-so long will our affairs wear a Confused aspect, so long shall we want energy. Do not flatter yourselves, do not fall into a state of lethergy and think that your danger is over. I have narrowly watchd the designs and manoeuvres of the Enemy, their late invasions have been with . the following designs; To offer themselves to their Friends, To get acquainted with and establish Correspondents in the Country-to discover its weakness & its strength-to Call forth numerous bodies of Militia & thereby Harrass and fatigue the yeomanry-increase confusion and disorder in our finances, destory our Military stores, take off our laborers and thereby diminish our ability to form Magazines, cramp our trade, weaken our power of sending reinforcements to the Southern states-and Establish posts from whence they can Issue out the next Campaign and attack a Country in great force already weakend, exhausted, Harrassed, & perhaps dispirited-destroying every thing before them. These are to me the evident designs of the enemy; and the object of their last Campaign. My advice is to be prepared against such pernicious designs. Organize and arrange your Militia, construct small but strong water defences to retard the progress of their shipping up the Rivers; have Six thousand well armed & well officerd Militia in the Field or ready to take the field in the Spring, have horses, Waggons, tents &c for them-have Magazines of Military stores well fortified in the upper inaccessible parts of the Country, secured against sudden attacks from Cavalry, repeal your tender law and give vigor to public Credit. If my finances will admit I propose to set off from this Place the 1st of October-but in the mean time I desire you will not omit writing to me by every opportunity.  God Bless you.  P.S. Since writing the above Some vessels are arrived here from the W Indies who bring accounts that they fell in with the French W. I. fleet of 26 Sail of the line Steering for our Coast.  ""

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia, 20th Augt. 1781. I have been punctual in corresponding with your Excellency since I resumed my Seat in Congress, but have not learned whether one of my Letters has been received. The Vermont business goes on briskly: If their agents had been authorized to renounce their late Encroachments everything was prepared for establishing their independent State within the Limits of their first Claim. But those people have connected themselves so closely with the Settlers of the grants on the East side of Connecticut River that they find it difficult to shake them off. Under these Circumstances we shall endeavour to get everything effected for the future Security of our State against Encroachments, which shall be in our power. I am however perfectly satisfied that much will depend on a liberal System for  AUGUST 20, 1781  Appropriating & Settling our Western Country. Happy woud it have been had my former plan, which met with your Excellency's approbation, been adopted. I trust the Wisdom of it will be more and more conspicuous. Some of its advantages are already lost forever.  We have private Letters giving Accounts of the rapid progress of the Arms of Heyder Ali Kan against the british in the East Indies. He has it is affirmed taken by storm after three unsuccessful attempts a garrisond place called Arcati in the Vicinity of Pondicherry & put every man to the Sword Amounting to 1500 Europeans, 50 of them officers & between 3 & 4000 Moors. Fally Cherry & Porto Novo & Pondicherry have also been taken, And it is added that 60,000 Moors were marching to attack Bengal: which had thrown the English there into the greatest Confusion & Consternation. It is further added that Heyder Ali Kan was besieging Velour the strongest Settlement of the British in the interior parts of Indoston. We have this Intelligence by the way of Martineque (1) where it had arrivd from Marseilles, but last from Malaga. This being the Authority I do not give the Information as Certain tho it is highly probable.  I enclose your Excellency a hand bill circulated about the Town, (2) on a subject very unfit for publication.  This will be handed to you by young Mr. Roosevelt.  Tomorrow we shall have the honour of writing your Excellency an \""Official\"" Letter. This is a friendly Scrawl and you will pardon its defects.

  Gent. Phila. 20th Augt. 1781 I inclose my accot. agt. the State (1) for Expences as well those for Housekeeping as for Horses and traveling without adding any thing extra per day as I know not certainly upon what footing the Delegates now are, having no satisfactory information on that head AUGUST 20, 1781  since I left the Assembly last Fall; at wch. time there was a proposition before the House changing the allowance to a certain stipend per day but have since been told it did not pass both branches of the legislature-from whence I conclude it remains on the firmer footing of defraying our expences. It may be necessary to say something explanatory of my account.  Before my return to Virginia last fall I rented a House of Mr. Saml. Pleasants in the neighbourhood of this City, at the rate of 75£ per ann. specie, intending when I came back to have brought up my Family-the rent was to be paid quarterly and commence the first payment the first of January. Before my departure for Virginia in April I expended some money, in laying in necessaries agt. my return and was obliged also to purchase some articles of furniture, the House rented being unfurnished. These shall be taken care of and accounted for when I leave Congress. On my return to Philadelphia the begining of May, I found when I reached Wilmington my continental currency of no use, and when I arrived in Philadelphia of little or no value, the exchange then being about 700 for one. It was not many days before it setled at abt. 500, and then, from necessity, I converted great part of my old continental currency into specie as I could find Chaps, which with the Sale of a portmantua-Horse and my Phaeton enabled me to rub on untill the Agent furnished the Bill on Mr. Morris, which being drawn at 50 days required a discount to obtain money. This detail will explain to you that part of my account where I charge continental for specie and credit the Specie. The balance that may be due from me in continental money you will extend as you think just, taking as I understand from Mr. Ross's Letter the Executive have directed, Mr. Braxton as accountable for the sum now due from him, and which the Agent will be able to settle on your acquainting him the money ought by agreemt. to have been paid in Philadelphia the last week in April. You will credit my accot. if it is not already done for the advances to Mr. Madison and Col. Bland which I presume their accounts rendered will support. I have attended 163 days to the 20th instant if any allowance is due on that account, but if I get my traveling expences allowed with other expences I am content- though the wear and tear of Horses, carriages, cloathing and other extra expences necessary to the appointment renders the office by no means eligible in point of Profit, whatever it may be in point of honor. But the situation of our Country and the losses sustained by many individuals as well as the public from the ravages of the Enemy leave us little room to complain, and exempt from inconveniences ourselves we shod be less disposed to simpathize with those who suffer.

  Sir, Philadelphia 20th August, 1781. Perhaps my Residence in this Place for near a Year without writing to your Excellency, may be deemed Inattention. Two Considerations have hitherto disswaded me from seeking an epistolary Correspondence: The one, your Excellency's necessary Application to an Infinity of important Objects; The other, General Sullivan, with whom, 'till of late, I have had the most unreserved Communications, has corresponded with your Excellency upon every military Subject, in wch. he or I could best serve the public, by carrying into Effect, with Propriety & Consistency, the Views of our Commander in Chief That Gentleman has returned to his own AUGUST 20, 1781  State; & this Event will form my Apology for this, & the subsequent Letters I may have Occasion to address to your Excellency.  A Committee has lately been appointed in Congress for reforming the present military Establishment, of wch. I am one. (1) I must confess the Measure appeared somewhat disagreable; but many Circumstances rendered an Acquiescence preferable to an Oppositon. But upon more mature Deliberation, I am induced to retract my first Sentiments, & shall pursue the Subject with unremitted Assiduity. Your Excellency's general Views & ours are one, the Salvation of America: I shall therefore particularly, tho' with the greatest Deferrence, communicate my Ideas, & feel a peculiar Happiness in the Persuasion of receiving yours, so far as local Circumstances, mutual Confidence and Cabinet Policy will admit. In calculating upon a permanent Force, we cannot anticipate the Termination of the present Campaign, nor decide upon the Negotiations that will take Place in Europe during the approaching Winter. We must suppose the Enemy retiring to Winter Quarters in our own Country, with (2) various Success, and preparing to enter upon Action as soon as possible. Our Country is the Object for which both Parties contend; Which ever of us shall be in firm Possession at the Time of a general Pacification, will carry the Prize. Nations admit of no Claims to sovereign Jurisdiction but what are founded in the Acquisition or Security of Force; & do not descend to Questions of Right, founded in municipal, civil or political Controversy. From Hence it is evident that the United States of America will never be acknowledged, by the Nations of Europe, as independent of Great Britain 'till the States exercise in fact civil Jurisdiction, supported by a permanent military Force, confining the Enemy to defensive Positions. The Possession of Posts, where military Law only can be exercised, is the weakest Situation of a Nation at War; & consequently, does not confer the Right of Soverignty. Therefore our political Object will be obtained, if we support an Army of equal Strength with that of the Enemy's. It must be confessed that a Situation capable of offensive Hostilities at all Times, would be far more eligible; but Experience teaches us that we must not be too sanguine upon this Head. We cannot suppose but the general Exertions, have been equal to the Convenience and Inclination, if not to the Abilities of The States: And altho' the Country abounds with Resources, it is a fact, that its Revenues are greatly in Anticipation. This is not the Result of Necessity, but of Mismanagement. Our political Measures are changed; but we cannot expect to feel immediately the beneficial Effects of the best Regulations. We may calculate, with some Degree of Precission, the Extent of our Finances for the coming Year. They must form the Basis of all our Arrangements; And if we attempt to exceed them in any Respect, it must be by temporary and partial Exertions, such as obtaining Detachments of Militia from particular Places, and for   particular Objects. The bitterest Reflection wounds us with the Idea of having an Army, at this Moment, badly cloathed, badly feed, and not paid. The Changes of Currency, & Instability of pecuniary Systems, will, in some Measure, account for these Evils; but we cannot suffer them to continue. We must fulfill punctiliously all our Ingagements; & then we may assure ourselves of an energetic Army.  It is impossible to oppose the Enemy in every given Point of Attack, so as to prevent Depredations: Our Object is to prevent Conquest; but what they gain by their Shipping, we must supply by the Exertions of our Militia. The Enemy's Troops in the United States, from Savannah to Penobscot inclusive, cannot be far from Eighteen or twenty Thousand Rank and File. I would therefore propose that our Army consist of Twenty Thousand Rank and File infantry, besides Cavalry and Artillery. It is an Observation by several military Writers that no Country can support, or rather afford, for permanent military Service, more than one Soldier to every one hundred Inhabitants. This Army will overrun the Calculation; but two Circumstances are favorable to us. The Troops are retained in our own Country, and the Army will be disbanded at the End of the War. The Nature of our political Association, founded in our Confederation, is such that we must proportion the Troops to each State, to be raised, officered, accoutred and equipped for the Field. They ought to be so proportioned as that no State will fail of producing its Quota. Unfortunately the Articles of Confederation provide that each State shall furnish Troops in Proportion to the Number of its white Inhabitants. A Rule so totally absurd, that we must endeavor, while we support it in Appearance, to get rid of it in Reality. For Instance, Virginia is rated higher than Massachusetts in white Inhabitants, while the Speck, Rhode-Island is a stronger military State than Virginia. Virginia is an extensive Territory, thinly inhabited, made up of independent Gentlemen, uninformed Peasants, and numerous Slaves. Massachusetts, is well populated Her Citizens are all equal, and Consequently infinitely advanced of Virginia in Civilization, interior Government & military Strength. It is undoubted therefore, that Massachusetts can raise an Army vastly superior to Virginia. North Carolina may be said to be in a State of Nature. Her Inhabitants were never, under the royal Government, rendered tame by the Restraints of Law, And Experience convinces us that they have made no great Progress in the Principles of Humanity since the War commenced. Few Men therefore can be expected from that State. South Carolina has been long in a Situation that renders it doubly feeble. Feeble in the first Instance from the aristocratic Ideas of its leading Men, and from the Number of its Slaves; In the second, by the Ravages of the Enemy, and the Desolations of our own People. Georgia, exhibits a striking Scene of human Wretchedness. Her few remaining Inhabitants contend with  each other, without a Sentiment of Benevolence; and their common Object is Plunder. Pennsylvania is without Exceptions the most respectable State in the Union, if we regard its Situation, its Soil, its Numbers & the manner of its Settlements. But when we contemplate its Government, \""Fate drops the Curtain,\"" and we can say no more. New Jersey and New York, are in particular Circumstances, & therefore cannot appear to Advantage. For the other States, Observations are unnecessary. The Quota's Rank and File, I propose, are, New Hampshire, one Thousand; Massachusetts, four Thousand; Rhode Island, six hundred; Connecticutt, two Thousand; Vermont, five hundred; New York, eleven hundred; New-Jersey, eleven hundred; Pennsylvania, three Thousand; Delaware, five hundred; Maryland, two Thousand; Virginia Twenty five hundred; North Carolina one Thousand; & South Carolina, one Thousand. To compensate for this Disproportion of Numbers, the States most effective, must either be satisfied with the Equity of the Case; or receive Subsidies.  Infinite have been our Disadvantages in having Officers beyond Bounds. Policy as well as Frugality urge the Necessity of curtailing their Numbers. The Attention to military Duty generally decreases in Proportion to the Number of Officers, whenever Idleness becomes habitual. The Objects of a laudible Ambition increase upon the contrary Principle, and give to personal Abilities a Dignity which otherwise would never appear.  Let each Battalion be commanded by a Lieutena[n]t Colonel, & two Majors: Let it be composed of five Companies, commanded each by one Captain, two Lieutenants and one Ensign. The Noncommissioned Officers may be four Serjeants, four Corporils & two Drums and Fifes to a Company. Two Battalions may form a Regiment to be commanded by a Colonel. I am sensible of the Objections to that Grade; but Compositions will ever enter into the Idea of Exchanges. We have a Number of full Colonels; This Arrangement will make a proper Distinction in their Command, from that of a Lt. Colonel's. Besides, it may be an humiliating Circumstance to subject all our Regimental Officers to the Orders of the French Regimental Officers. I have made an exact Calculation of the Savings upon this Plan; it will exceed fifteen hundred Thousand Dollars, annually in the Pay only, while we shall probably obtain a more effective Army than upon the present system. Much depends upon a good Corps of Artillery. While they are assigned to particular States, they will appoint the Officers: Consequently, we shall be chagrined. I would reduce that Establishment to Three Regiments, joining the Virginia & Pennsylvania Corps. The Officers and Men Should remain, without counting them upon the Quota of any State, trusting to General Inlistments, or finally Drafts to compleat them. It is extremely difficult to speak of Cavalry with any degree of Certainty.   They are very essential; but enormously expensive. However, let these Corps remain as at present, after joining the two Virginia Regiments; They must also be recruited at large, & not credited to any State. We must alter our System with Regard to Waiters. Officers can readily obtain Servants, if we furnish them with Money for the Purpose; and at a much cheaper Rate than Soldiers are obtained. .  The prodigious Number of our Brigades becomes an Object of Magnitude, upon the Principles of Finance. A Brigadier General requires much Provision, & much Forage. Suppose three Regiments should constitute a Brigade; the whole Infantry will then compose seven Brigades, allowing Hazens Regiment to remain as it is. We need not, upon this Arrangement, retain more than fourteen Brigadiers in Service. The Idea of Divisions will vanish, & indeed they enter not into the Principles of Grand Tacticks: Major Generals will then command Wings, Lines, & Seperate Departments. We may dispense with several Gentlemen in that Grade; And with a great Deal of Expence. But in these Reductions the greatest Delicacy must Be observed. They should therefore retire upon half Pay, liable to be recalled into Service whenever the Commander in Chief shall deem it expedient. A total Reform is necessary in the civil Departments of the Army; But as these Lines will come under the immediate Attention of the Financier, I shall not trouble your Excellency with any Observations upon that head. My Observation respecting Georgia may be taken in too great a Latitude. There are virtuous Citizens of that distressed State, distressed in different parts of the Continent, & I am well informed that they have raised three hundred State Troops at the Request of General Greene, who behave extremely well. The Plunderers are made up of Tories, & some independent Parties, in Nature of Marauders. Perhaps this new raised Corps may be adopted upon the general Plan.  We have been so fortunate at last as to elect a Minister of foreign Affairs. The Time draws near for appointing a Secretary at War. There will be a great Difficulty respecting the Candidates. I recollect a Question in one of your Excellency's former Letters to General Sullivan. Be pleased to receive from me the real Answer. That Gentleman was in Nomination, And to get rid of the Embarrassment, Congress postponed the Election.(3) General Greene is most talked of, but he cant be taken from the Line. Will General Heath fill the Place with Propriety? I know he sometimes hesitates; but he has many excellent Qualities. How will General Glover answer for Commissary General of Prisoners? Will it be political to promote Generals Greene & Lincoln to the Rank of Lt. General? The detaching Mr. Peters to Camp was a political Manoeuvre of your Friends. He has been a long Time in the Process of Reformation & it is believed, will soon come out intirely purified. General Cornel is an  excellent hand-& has been of infinite Service in the War Office. In the Course of Octr. or November next, I shall return to Rhode Island; Previous to which I hope the Arrangements for next Campaign will be compleated.  I have the Honor of being, with the most perfect Respect, your Excellency's most obedient, & very humble Servt.,  J M Varnum.  ""

The Intrepid, an old 74 French ship, accidentally Took fire at the Cape, & was burnt, most of her Stores, rigging &c sav'd, & a french frigate was blown up at sea, the crew perish'd.  Mr. Saml. Parsons writes to the Presidt from St. Pierre July 1st.(2) The Substance-Official intelligence from Marseilles via Malaga, that Heyder Ali Kan had taken by Storm Arcate, every man put to AUGUST 21, 1781  Portrait of Daniel Carroll  the Sword excepting abt 50 British Officers conceald by some French in Heyders Army. Fally Cherry taken by Storm, Garrison likewise put to the Sword. Porto-Novo & Ponticherry likewise taken & 60 thousand marching to attack Bengal, which had thrown the British into the greatest Consternation. This he says is confirmed by a packet arriv'd at Antigua, adding that Heyder Ali Kan was beseiging Velour the strongest settlement of the British in the interior parts of Indostan, when the expresses left the Coast of Coromandel.  Mr. Necker has certainly resignd. This Step woud probably have not been disagreable to the Spanish Ministry some time passd for particular reasons, but at present it may possibly cause some embarrassment both in the Spanish, & French finances. It appears by an account publishd of the Latter by this great Financier, that notwithstanding the great demands necessary for carrying on the war, he had manag'd the resources of that Kingdom, so as to lessen not only the interest of, but the National Debt itself, & increase the value of the public funds, without having any new taxes laid. This public[ation] gave a surprizing Spring to public credit. It convined the understanding, it did more, it manifested the honesty of the person thro' who's hands the Public money was to pass. This is the account given me of this Piece. I have not had time to read it.(3) You will be sorry & surprizd that so able a man is laid aside. It is said he was of an inflexible temper, which wou'd not perm[it] him to bend to the opinions of some who's patronage obtaind the station for him which he held. It is likewise said he was averse to loans or Subsidys. He intimated in his publication that an eco[no]mical management of the resources of France was preferable to any Alliance.  I had made it a rule to say little to you by post, excepting what relates to business, or public occurrences & therefore shall not add further at present than to request you to present my Comps. to Mrs Lee, & to those who may enquire after me. I am, Dear Sr. with great esteem, Your Mo. Aff. & Obt Ser, Danl. Carroll (4)  RC James S. Copley Library, La Jolla, California).  1 Neither Carroll's letter to Lee nor its enclosures have been found.  2 See Elias Boudinot to Lewis Pintard, August 20, 1781, note 1.  3 \""This public[ation]\"" was undoubtedly Jacques Necker's Compte rendu au roi, his annual report as French minister of finance, which had been published in February 1781. In this first public accounting of royal finances, Necker made the misleading claim that the ordinary revenues of the French government exceeded expenses sufficiently to cover the interest payments on the new war loans for the 1781 campaign. Notwithstanding, Necker knew that the French war effort was financially disastrous and had begun secret negotiations with the British to end the war on terms unacceptable to the comte de Vergennes and the French court. Ultimately, Vergennes, who regarded the publication of Necker's report as a blatant appeal to public opinion and an interference in foreign affairs, urged Louis XVI to accept Necker's resignation in May. See Robert D. Harris, \""Necker's Compte Rendu of 1781; a Reconsideration,\"" Journal of Modern History, 42 (June 1970): 161-83; his \""French  Finances and the American War, 1777-1783,\"" ibid., 48 (June 1976):233-58; and Orville T.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia, August 21. 1781 Since writing to you by the last post, Ira Allen, Fay, and Woodward, from Vermont, have arrived here, and sent into Congress their commission as Delegates from the State of Vermont (as they term it) and also their powers to treat on terms of admission into the federal Union.(1) The Committee who were appointed in pursuance of the resolution of the 7th of this instant (a copy of which we had the honor of transmitting to your Excellency) were instructed to confer with them on the subject of their commission, and to report thereon. A conference ensued, (2) and the Committee reported that the agents from Vermont made their proposals in writing, which were, That as they had no authority to relinquish any part of their present jurisdiction, they requested to be admitted into the Union, and the independence of Vermont acknowledged; after which they would settle any dispute with New York or New Hampshire, according to the Articles of Confederation. Some gentlemen (if I may so call them) would have gladly accepted of their proposals. After a considerable time spent in debate, the enclosed resolution was agreed to;(3) but that there will be a sufficient firmness to adhere to the same, I should much doubt were it not for New Hampshire's being in Similar circumstances with New York, in respect to Vermont's late extended jurisdiction. So engaged are the Eastern States and many others to favor this claim of independence, that all other business must give way to that; which is the reason that the dispute between the Quarter Master General and Colo Hay, altho' it has been the order of the day for a considerable time, is not yet decided. I trust it will be determined as soon as Mr. Allen and his associates are gone out of town, which I hope will be today. The expectation of the sudden arrival of the French Squadron from the West Indies on our coast, the various conjectures of the particular place of their destination, and the probable events which may take place in consequence thereof, has engrossed a great part of the conversation of all companies for two days past. The new Continental State money has appreciated here from the exchange of five for one to two and  AUGUST 21, 1781  an half for one; and yesterday it was said it would pass today at two for one. I have not omitted writing to you, every week since I have been here, but fear something has prevented your receiving my letters, and I have not had the pleasure of receiving a single line from your Excellency.

  Dear Sir Philadelphia 21st. Augst. 1781. Since the Arrival of the Vermont Agents Congress have resumed the Controversy and come to the Decision enclosed..(1) It was not without Difficulty that we prevailed on Congress to establish a Boundary capable of some Precision as far as Fort Edward (to wit) a twenty Mile Line from and agreeable to the general Course of  AUGUST 21, 1781  Hudson's River. The Agents and their Friends contended that the West Bounds of the Towns granted by the late Government of New Hampshire should wholly form the Division Line: but this would have been so violent an Encroachment on our ancient Grants that Congress unanimously rejected the Attempt. From the Termination of the above Line those Grants and the Northern Waters fix our Limits. The Grants are by no means a proper Boundary as there were no actual Surveys prior to the Patents and the Occupants were left to settle at Discretion but there was no Remedy.  Your Excellency will perceive that we have been placed in a Situation truly painful. Those who reasoned without Prejudice admitted it was a Sacrifice of the Rights of Individual States for the publick Safety: but they conceived, bad as was the Precedent, it was a necessary Sacrifice in our present critical Circumstances. On these Principles our Title was winked out of Sight, altho' it was maintained by the most satisfactory Evidence. It will be fruitless to enlarge on this vexatious Subject. A Decision might prossibly have been deferred: but the Confusion would have increased.  Your Excellency will be pleased to observe that the Dissent of our State has been given in every Stage of this Business. We insisted on a judicial Determination on the Right, in the Spirit of the Act of Congress of September 1779. (2) The present Act is grounded on Expediency or Policy, tho' it is not so expressed.

  Sir, August 21 st. 1781. Upon the foregoing System, each Battalion of Infantry consisting of five hundred Rank and File, a very considerable Reduction of Officers will be necessary.(1) I have ever esteemed it a Misfortune that by the last Arrangement a large Number of Officers retired upon half pay, without being liable to a Recall into Service. Rapid Promotions are extremely injurious to the Service. The Appointment of Ensigns upon every Vacancy detracts from regular Discipline, and too often lessens the Number of Rank and File, by the Promotion of Serjeants, who cost the Public too much upon the  AUGUST 21, 1781  footing of Commissions. Besides there is something inexplicable in the Nature of military Gradation, by which a good Serjeant seldom makes a valuable Officer. But the past we cannot alter; happy will it be if we can introduce more Propriety in future Establishments. If practicable therefore, I could wish that the Officers who become supernumerary, might retire upon furlough; be intitled to half pay; but liable to be recalled into Service without Prejudice to their Rank; That those in and out of the Field might exchange Situations, from Time to Time, with the Approbation, and under the Direction of the Commander in Chief. But if any Officer should incline to retire absolutely, he might be indulged. I am sensible of the great Objection, that the Officers remaining will think themselves deprived of the common Chances of Promotion. But on the other hand, those who retire absolutely are totally deprived of Promotion, as well as Rank; To wch., in the first Instance, they are equally intitled with others. Previous to the Moment of Reduction, the Idea of Promotion is connected with the whole Number of Officers: If a part should be totally reduced, the others gain an Advantage to the Injury of the former, whereas upon my Principle they loose nothing, except it be said that the Proportion of Deaths increases with the extent of Numbers unequally. This Principle however, is now founded in Generocity. The Increase of sinecure Establishments must be very disagreable, as the Nature of their Existence is incompatible with the Policy of Republican Government. However, should this Mode be deemed ineligible, cannot we strengthen the military Establishment, by permitting reduced Officers upon this Arrangement to exchange Situations with those who remain in Service, in the same Rank, and upon reasonable Composition, subject to proper Restrictions and Conditions?  I am very anxious for fixing the Corps of Artillery and Horse upon a strictly continental Establishment, as the States will not then have it in their Power to appoint the Officers. The joining the Pennsylvania and Virginia Regiments, will enable us to comply with your Excellency's Views with respect to Colo. Carrington &c. which otherwise we cannot do, as the Right of the State of Pennsylvania to appoint to Vacancies in their artillery Regiment, accrued immediately upon ratifying the Articles of Confederation on the first of March last; & Colo. Proctor's Resignation was subsequent to that Period.  Frequent Changes in military Systems are too evincive of Instability. The Minds of the Officers may be affected by the Precariousness of their standing, and your Excellency's Delicacy will probably be wounded from the Intercourse of sympathetic Applications. These Reflections give Me the most painful Concern: But I hope it will be considered that the wretched Situation of our Finances, has happily occasioned essential Reforms in our general Policy, & if the pro-  posed Arrangement, or a more eligible one, will greatly subserve those Purposes, I persuade myself it will be acceeded to without Reluctance.  I am, with the greatest Esteem, your Excellency's most obedt. & very humble Servt. J M Varnum  ""

  August 23, 1781. I shall be well pleased, my dear Ma'am, (1) on a variety of grounds, to find that the information I am about to give you, became insignificant by the Time it reached you. I suspect Comodre. Gillon or Capt. Eden will have anchored at Boston from Holland.  The Reward of My Intentions is already paid down. That which is AUGUST 23, 1781  essentially connected with the Knowledge of having really contributed to the Composure of your anxieties will be my lot perhaps at the next trial.  Mr. Dana was well May 28th. Capt. Mason left the Texel the 29 and got safely to these Capes, when he was taken and carried to Bermudas, from whence he arrived this morning at Philada. He had been obliged on the 8th of June to destroy a very large Bag of Letters, when on the point of being taken by the Suffolk man of war He was detained on board 5 hours, but by certain arts avoided being known as American property: The Suffolk was with three other Ships of the Line convoying 65 sail from Jamaica, and had, three days before, taken the Marq de Fayette, which was in company; having fought well 3 hours before she struck: It is an heavy Loss in Soldiers Cloathing, &c.  Within half a week of the sailing of Captain Mason from the Texel Mr. Adams had gone into a vast change of Living; from a course of private Lodging with command of two rooms, He took a grand House, rolled his Chariot, multiplied his Servants and put on the minister plenipo. without any other Explanation than what the free publication of his memorial in all the Gazettes naturally gave.2 The general persuasion was that their High Mightinesses were fully decided to declare in our favour.

He consequently presented memoranda of March 8 and April 19 to the Estates General and had his April 19 memorial published and widely distributed.

  Sir, Philadelphia, August 23d. 1781.  I have the honor to inclose to your Excellency several Acts of Congress relating to exchanges of Prisoners, one dated the 14th of AUGUST 23, 1781  June last, the others the 21st and 22d Instant; which are in answer to your letter of the 17th Instant; and I hope they will meet your wishes on this subject.(1) Portsmouth is said to be evacuated, and Lord Cornwallis is still fortifying at York-town and Glocester; he is otherwise very quiet: Of this however we have no official accounts. It is re[ported] that General Sumpter and Colonel Lee have had an acti[on] with a party of the enemy to the Southward of Monk's corner (I think at Dorchester) in South Carolina, that they have taken about one hundred and forty prisoners and killed near an hundred; some waggons and stores were also taken. No account of this affair has been received from Genl. Greene by Congress, but it comes in such a manner as to gain credit.  I am possessed of a letter written by a Richard Nash on board the Terrible at Antigua, dated the 6th Instant, to his Father on bo[ard] the London at New-York, informing him that Sir Samuel Hood, with the greatest part of the Fleet there, would sail in a few days for New York. From other accounts I learn, that Admiral Rodney had sailed for England with three Ships of the line; that Admiral Hood had dispatched a Frigate for St. Lucia-Bay for six Men of War, and that he purposed to sail for New-York at the return of the Frigate. I apprehend that Richard Nash is Captain or a Lieutenant on board the Terrible, from his requesting his Father to present his Compliments to Admiral Graves; and that the Father is Master of the London, for the letter is directed to him as \""N.

Town is a main object-whether previous or subsequent to an attack in Cheasepeak, must depend on circumstances. The operating force, will be respectable both by Sea, & land.

(Yet it is not to be doubted) therefore the Committee do not write to you,(1) but I thought is so important, that I should have been inexcusable as a friend, not to give you the earliest communication of it, especially by so safe and good an opportunity, as you will thereby be enabled to anticipate the measures that will be necessary to be taken by you, in so interesting a conjuncture, that is to say, as far as your slender means can apply. S[h]ould you not have received official information before this reaches you, I think you may venture to act on what I now give you, as derived from the most authentic source.

He sailed from the Texel May 29 was taken close off the Capes of Delaware, after about 8 weeks passage and carried to the island from whence he is now arrived on parole to release another Captain for a balance. He had lately before sailing from Holland, dined with Mr. Adams and his family, who were all well. This gentleman brought out from the Texel the quantity of a barrel of letters, but was obliged to sink them on the 8th of June, when he was brought to by the Suffolk man of war, and endured a search and examination for 5 hours, but was not discovered to be an American vessel. The Suffolk was with three other ships of the line convoying 65 merchantmen from Jamaica, and had, a few days before, taken, after 3 hours engagement, the Marquis de Fayette a 44 gun ship with our cloathing, &c.  Capt. Mason mentions that about three days before he left Holland Mr. Adams had made a very great change as to an exhibition of character, had taken a large house, proper equipage and servants; and it was not doubted to be according to the wishes and designs of their High Mightinesses. (2) I conclude from my memorandum book that Mr. A. must have received at that Period our Resolves and Instructions respecting the Completion of the Union, March 1st. by the signature of Maryland to the articles.  You may expect Commod: Gillon momently in a ship of 24 42 pounders on one deck. There is also a Capt. Eden or something like it bound for Boston. People connected Mr. A's appearance with a certain proceeding of Gillon very suddenly unloaded known private property and received other Goods at the same Hours, one Shallop going and another coming constantly. The memorial of mr. a is spoken of by Capt. Mason, as it is by Mr. Carmichael, very familiarly, both conceiving we have it amongst us, but we only see it hinted at sneeringly in British papers. Is not this vexatious to us Evites?  I hope the Children with you, and their Mama enjoy perfect Health. They have much of my LOVE.

  Dr Sir, Phil. Augt [25] 1781 I think it my Duty in every great national Question especially that are of general Importance & in which the Welfare of the union is concerned, to keep the Legislature informed of the proceedings in Congress and particularly of the Conduct of their Delegates that nothing of Consequence may be done by them contrary to the Sense of their Constituents. It would indeed be an advantageous Circumstance for the State, was a committee of Correspondence appointed on the recess of the Legislature, thro whom mutual Information might be kept up between the Delegates in Congress & the State. Suffer me on this Occasion officially to trouble your Excy. with some late Transactions in Congress relating to the State of Vermont so called, in which I apprehend the united States are particularly interested, and which in the End are likely to involve the States in a civil war, and to beg your Excy. to lay the same before the Legislature at their next Meeting. When I took my Seat in Congress last July, I found that frequent Applications had been made to Congress by the States of New York & N Hampshire in order to settle the Line between the two States on the West of Connecticut River-by which a Tract of Land of about 100 Miles Long & [5?]0 broad claimed by the Inhabitants as an independent State, would be included in one or both of those States. The Inhabitants stiling themselves the State of Vermont made application to be recognized an Independent State & received into the Union, engaging to fulfull  AUGUST 25, 1781  equal Duties to any State in the union agreable to the Constitution. The States of New York & N Hampshire insisted that this tract of Country had been part of the One or both of those Colonies & still belong to one or both of them as States & therefore could not be dismembered by Congress. The People by their Agents insisted that they being oppressed by the late Colony of New York had opposed her Government previous to the Revolution-that they were the first to begin the Revolution-that they took the fortress of Ticonderoga & Crown point-That at the Revolution they were in a State of Nature-That they then set up a new Government and have ever since been in the actual Possession of Sovereign Power-That they have a Legislature, have enacted Laws, erected Court of Justice, levied Men-That they have done their Part in the common Cause-That they fought the Battle of Bennington and finally that they would not submit the Question of their Independence to any Jurisdiction or Power on Earth and therefore protested agt all Right in Congress to determine that Question but in Case they were Represented in that Body, they would submit to the Terms of the Confederation in every Point. Their Claim extended from the west of Connecticut River to a Line 20 Miles East of North River & from Massachusetts South to North Latitude 45° North. Congress had engaged to proceed to the Settlement of the Dispute on a certain Day, but finding the Matter of too ser[ious] a Nature to trifle with and that the consequence might involve the States in a bloody civil war at a very critical & important period and that on a Question whether the Inhabitants of sd. Territory should govern themselves or be governed by others agt their Will, and considering that all Government was for the happiness of the People, postponed this Question and so it remained in July last. About this Time Application was made to Congress by the Governor of N Hampshire complaining of the Incroachmt of those People & praying the Aid of Congress, this was committed with a former report of a Committee to another Committee, who having fully considered the Matter and reported to Congress the whole was taken up in a new point of Light.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia, August 28, 1781 We have no letters from General Greene since my last, (1) altho' reports give him new advantages. They indeed go so far as to assure us that he has got betwen Lord Rawdon's main body and Charlestown and in a late battle crippled them severely. We wait impatiently for a confirmation. Lord Cornwallis is quietly employed  AUGUST 28, 1781  in fortifying between York Town and Gloucester, and suffers the Marquis to forage upon his very lines. It may be concluded that he thinks himself too feeble to force an action or that he is in expectation of reinforcement, or perhaps of a formidable assault. You, Sir, have so full an idea of the intended operations that you can form just conclusions. I am apprehensive you will not pass an inactive Autumn; God grant that it may be a prosperous one!  We have a long representation from Colonel Floyd respecting the grievances of our friends on Long-Island.(2) It will be the basis of some furthey resolutions which will go to the bottom of the mischief. We are ordered to press Congress to establish our Western boundary, so that we may rest secure from Eastern claims or intrusion. I am taking the previous steps. With most respectfull compliments to Mrs. Clinton, and every sentiment of esteam and attachment for yourself-I remain, Dear Sir, Your Excellency's affectionate And most humble Servant, Jas. Duane.

I have written to you on the subject by three different conveyances.(1) We are all at a loss for your silence. The President informed me that he notified you officially by the way of head-quarters.(2) At this juncture, delay is unfortunate, as the fullest point of our administration is in our foreign affairs and the Remedy at length applied has long been loudly called for.

  Sir [August 28 1781 ] (1) This day I was favoured with your letter of the 16th of this instant,(2) which is the first time I have heard from Home, and the only letter from thence that I have receiven since I have been here. I informed you sometime ago of the Resolution of Congress desiring Governor Trumbull immediately to recall the Commissions he had granted, (3) if I have time to take a copy. I will send you one inclosed, it was expected he would put a sudden stop to the Plundering, although I much question whether he will or not. The Instructions to Captains or Commanders of armed Vessels commissioned, in pursuance of the ordinance on the 27th of March, limits the Captures to the High Seas, or between high and low water marks, AUGUST 28, 1781  This was supposed by Congress to be a full expiration of the ordinance, and they would not believe but it would prevent any misconstruction thereafter.  I shall endeavour to get something more pointed if possible, tho I much Question whether any resolution will be so much regarded in Connecticut as to prevent their plundering, Retalliation from the State of New-York will be the only thing that will prevent it. The Law of the Land is now plainly against it, and I am very sure there will be no kind of Difficulty in reversing the Judgments that have been obtained by the Admiralty, in the Court of appeals, it has been unfortunate for our Friends that the Court did not sit at Hartford according to Expectation. I have frequently conversed with the Judges on the Subject, and find there is little or no probability of their going, they have not received but a small part of their Salerries, and say unless they can get money from the Public, which is unlikely they are incapasitated to go the journey & be absent from home on Expence, for so long a Time. They have advised to have the Cases sent up here to be tryed, which I think will be better for our Friends than to permit them to remain longer undetermined. I have wrote to Colo. Seymour (4) to send up the Records of the Causes of Fanning and Gardner if it be agreeable to them. The Expence of the Lawyers here will not be equal to the Demands of those in Connecticut. I have spoke to Mr. Wilson to undertake the Causes in Case they are brought up. It is my Opinion that the Judgment below, would be reversed if they had no advocate at all; it may however be best to have Council as probably the Captors will, the Court is now adjorned but will sit again in this Place in about Six Weeks. I wrote to you before that Congress refused to determine the Dispute with Vermont on the Principles engaged by the Resolution of the 12th of Sept. 1779 but have proceeded upon the Principles of Expediency, and have proposed recognizing their Independence and admitting them into the federal Union if Terms can be agreed on, one Preliminary is that they relinquish all Jurisdiction or Claim on the East Side of Connecticut River & Seventy Miles East of Hudson's River, what those people will determine on I know not but to me it is pro[ba]ble [t]hat this Tract of Country will be sacrificed and lost to New-York, to answer the avaricious Views of some States, the Conduct of our legislature at Albany last winter & the Influence of some of our Principal People in the State since had greatly tended to bring this Business to its present State. I conclude that I can not give you news more than you will have to the Eastward and in the inclosed Papers. The Prospect of Peace does not appear to be so near as it did sometime ago, and the prospect of taking New-York this campaign is very small, tho' upon a general View of our affairs in Europe and America, our Prospects are very flattering. I conclude you have thought it strange that the Main Army should  leave the State of New-York, which is reported here to be the Case. I make no doubt notwithstanding we may be disappointed in our Expectations of taking New York the Campaign will terminate greatly in our favour. With respects to the Children I am your most Humble Servt. Ezra L'Hommedieu  P.S.

  Dear Sir, (1) Philadelphia, August 28, 1781. I Have this Day received your Favour, and beg you will excuse my not writing to you before, as it was not owing to Inattention, but the want of Leisure; and have now only Time to return you Answer in few Words. I am Sorry that it is not in my Power to answer all your Questions, when we shall have Peace is uncertain, the Period appears to be further of[f] than it did some time ago; tho' upon taking a general View of our Affairs in Europe & America our Prospects are very flattering; and altho' we may not get Possession of New-York this year, there is every reason to expect the Campaign will terminate greatly in our favour. With respect to Gov. Trumbull's Commission by a late Resolve of Congress,(2) he is desired immediately to recall them, which I conclude he has done before now. I am confident every Judgment obtained in the Courts of Admiralty on Captures by those Commissions, will be reversed by the Court of Appeals, 'tis unfortunate for our People that the Court will not probably sit in Connecticut soon. I think it will be best for them to have the appeals determined here, as a Delay may be injurious to them. At my Arrival here I found a general Disposition to recognize the Independence of Vermont, and to admit them into the Federal  AUGUST 28, 1781  union on certain Conditions, and to take up the Business on the principle of Expediency separate from the merits of the Cause. I have not Time to inform you of the various motives that probably induced the different States to countenance this Measure, but undoubtedly the Conduct of the Members of our Legislature, at least some of them, last Winter at Albany, has had its full effect here, and I think it more than probable that New-York will be obliged to sacrifice her rights for what may be called the general Good, but more properly to answer the ambitious and avaritious Views of some particular States and Individuals. As to our Finances they are at present very low, owing in great measure to the want of public Credit; it has been a fortunate Circumstance that a Financier General has been appointed with very large Powers, in whose Hands are deposited all our Funds. The New Continental Money issued under the Direction of the State has appreciated in this City from six for one to two and an half the present current Exchange. Since I have been here I have great dependence on the abilities and Exertions of this Gentleman, and altho' we are now much distressed for want of Money, I trust, if the States can be prevailed on to do what they [are] able, we may carry on the war without distressing individuals so much as has heretofore been practised. I have been very happy in the enjoyment of my health in this unhealthy Climate in the hot season. I have suffered much but not equal to my fears, the mornings and evenings begin to be comfortable, I hope I may be preserved from Sickness, and return in Safety to my family and Friends.

Two large ships sailed under her convoy, loaden with Stores for us, unluckly one of them got dismasted, & was obliged to put back, the other is safe arrived. The contents of her cargo we are not as yet acquainted with. The Ministers dispatchs (as far as he had thought proper to communicate) contain the following advices. (1) \""This frigate sailed with the grand fleet of France from Breast, on the 23 June under the Command of Count D'Guechen, he parted with them five days after, when they bore away to join the Spanish fleet off Cadiz; the destination of the combined fleets, was a profound Secret.  \""That a french squadron had fallen in with a british one, bound to the East Indies off the cape de verd islands, that the former had driven the latter for protection, under the guns of one of the Portuguese forts, & took four very valuable Indiamen that were under their convoy [This is supposed to be Commodore Johnson's Squadron] That by the last accounts from the East Indies the British were in the utmost distress.\"" I leave you to make your own comments on this news.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia, August 28, 1781. As the General Court of Massachusetts, will meet about the time this will reach you, I am induced to write you respecting the letter from a committee of our legislature to their Delegates in Congress. The letter is now referred to the financier; and it seems to be the intention of Congress that he should have the arrangement of the finances.(1) I have had a little conversation with him, and find it to be his prevailing opinion, that the resolve of the 18th of March must be adhered to; so far as it respects calling in the old money at least: and that a farther day should be given, after which the delinquent States shall be held to pay to the United States, specie in lieu of the old money, making twenty old continental dollars equal to one dollar in specie, agreeable to the principles of said resolve-Whether, if the Financier proposes a rigid adherence to said resolve, it will meet with the approbation of Congress time only will determine. I flatter myself the Financier is not unacquainted with our exertions, and that he is heartily disposed to adjust matters equitably between the States; it lays with him, and I believe he is fully impressed with the necessity of a speedy settlement of the accounts of the States; more especially since the resolves of the 25th of February (respecting specified requisitions) and of the 18th of March, 1780; until he has made his arrangements no step can be taken by Congress. I hope this will be done, so that the legislature may be furnished therewith at their next session, I have no doubt but Mr. Morris will render us great service, and I hope we shall use our utmost endeavours to support him.  As soon as any thing of consequence turns up, upon this subject, I shall do myself the pleasure to communicate it.

We have been honored with your Excellencys Letter of the 13th Instant.(1) Since our Letter of the 24th July, (2) nothing very material has occurred, saving Gen. Washington's crossing the Hudson River. This Movement is pregnant with great Events. Should Count de Grasse soon arrive with a large Fleet, as far as human Wisdom can determine, the Campaign will terminate gloriously. We hope it will, For altho' our Situation wears an infinitely better Aspect than it did some Time since, yet our Debts are daily augmenting, and no Money produced into the general Treasury. The British are amazingly distressed in the East Indies, and the French Squadron having met with and defeated commodore Johnston's Squadron, will probably compleat their Ruin in that quarter. The Brest Fleet, commanded by Count Guichen, sailed on the 23d of June last to join the Spanish; so that we may expect the Channel is awed, and the homeward bound Jamaica Fleet in danger of Capture.

  Sir No.7 Philada. Augst. 28th. 1781 We were yesterday favored with your Excellency's two letters of the 10th & 17th instant. Our plan of writing weekly by the post has we assure you been in no instance departed from.(1) As soon as a State of your advances to the prisoners brought from Charlestown arrives we shall endeavour to obtain a reimbursement of them. At the same time it is incumbent on us to apprize you that the present condition of the public Treasury, & the pretensions of almost every state to exertions & contributions beyond its just proportion which would warrant similar applications, forbid much reliance on our success.(2) The force of these obstacles has just been experienced in the impracticability of obtaining for General Spotswood a small sum assigned over to him by a Citizen of Virginia to whom it was due from the United States.(3) The danger of increasing the importunities and discontent of the public Creditors by such a precedent, and the appropriation of every fund to the essential purposes of the Campaign from which it is surmized relief must eventually accrue to Virginia, prevailed over every consideration drawn from the justice of the demand & the use to which it was destined. So uncertain indeed must be the reimbursement of all advances made for the U. States whilst our means continue so inadequate to the general expenditures, that the State will be justified in declining them in every instance where humanity & the most essential objects will admit. To prevent however as far as possible objections to repayment in cases where they cannot be avoided, we request the attention of Your Excellency to the keeping us well informed of the compliance of Virginia with the several requisitions of Congress, & of all such extraordinary supplies as may from time to time be derived from her.  All that we can answer on the subject of cloathing for the Soldiers is that due attention will be given to the equitable share which Virginia is entitled to out of the general supplies procured for the U. States. The capture of a very large ship, the Marquis la fayette freighted with almost the whole of our expectations for the present year renders this resource for the present very deficient. About three thousands suits which arrived some time ago at Boston from Spain, with the unspecified contents of a Vessel just arrived at the same place from France constitute the principal Stock on hand. The additions to be made to it will depend on the generosity of our Ally & the chances of the Sea.  By a French Frigate which came with the Vessel last mentioned, & which brings a supply of money & other Articles to the French Armaments, we understand that the Brest fleet commanded by the Count de Guichen sailed on the 23d of June in order to make a  AUGUST 28, 1781  junction with that of Spain, and that the French Squadron composed of five Ships of the line destined to the East Indies had fallen with the British Squadron under Commodore Johnstone, of the same number of Ships of the line, & the distination, off the Cape Verd Islands, that the latter had been obliged after a severe combat, to seek shelter under a Portuguese fort on the coast of Africa, & that four of its Convoy had been taken by the former.  A communication of every thing relating to the operations of the main army, and which can properly be entrusted to the channel of the post, makes a part of our plan of correspondence; and if little has been hitherto said on that head, it was, because little has taken place that required it. At present the movements of the Army indicate designs of material consequence, but as we have no doubt that wheresoever a disclosure of them can be useful it will be made through a military channel, we shall readily be excused in passing them over.  We are assured from the proper quarter that no more of the Arms sent to the Southward have been charged to the State of Virginia than were allotted to be her own property.(4)  Twelve blank commissions with instructions &c. for armed Vessels were sent on the 15th instt. by Express from the Secretary's office which we hope will for the present be sufficient.(5)  We have the honor to be with sentiments of the highest esteem & respect, Yr.

  Sir Philadelphia Sepr. 1st, 1781. I beg leave to call the attention of your Excellency for a moment to the State of North Carolina respecting a quantity of arms which I conceive essential for her immediate defence.  On the 26th of April last Congress gave the following order, \""That the board of war cause the rampart muskets in their possession to be repaired and forwarded with all possible dispatch to the executives of Virginia and North Carolina a quantity not exceeding two thousand to each State charging to the said States respectively the value of the muskets with the expence of repairing and transporting them.\"" (1) As Virginia was soon after invaded by a large body of the enemy, the first of those arms that could be repaired were sent to that state, which enabled her to support the Marquis so effectually as to oblige the enemy to retreat from the upper country. The remainder of the old arms required so much repairing that it was impossible to get those intended for North Carolina forwarded as soon as could be wished.  About three weeks ago, when it was reported that Lord Cornwallis intended to come up the bay to Baltimore, on a request of the SEPTEMBER 1, 1781  Govr. of Maryland, five hundred of those arms intended for North Carolina were immediately sent down to Baltimore for the defence of that State.  There are now near one thousand muskets and I believe fifteen hundred cartouch boxes and a quantity of fixed amunition ready for transportation to North Carolina. On the application of Genl. Knox, the board of war reported and Congress concurred therewith yesterday that those arms should be forwarded to the southern army and be subject to the disposal of the Commander in Chief or the commanding officer of the Southern department, the order of the 26th of April notwithstanding.(2)  North Carolina is so destitute of arms, the causes of which need not now be enumerated, that she is not able to arm one third of the new levies raised in the state, nor can she arm her militia to any considerable amount.  The order of the 26 of April with all the ulterior proceedings and stages of this business have been accurately communicated to the State by her delegates here and it has reason to expect those arms &c are, by this time on the way.  Your Excellency will therefore easily conceive how painful and disagreeable the resolution of yesterday will be when the government is informed of it.  I have thought it my duty to inform you of these circumstances and beg leave to add, an assurance that myself and the State which have the honor to represent have entire confidence in your abilities and disposition to support and defend every State in the union.  With the highest respect & esteem, I have the honor to be, Your Excellencys Most Obedient Humble Servant,  Wm. Sharpe  ""

  Dear Sir Philada. Sepr. 3d. 81. I am favored with yours of the 27th ultimo.(1) This letter will be the most agreeable of any I have long had the pleasure of writing. I begin with informing you that the Commander in chief and the Ct. Rochambeau, the former with a part of the American Army, and the latter with the whole of the French are thus far on their way for the Southern Department. The American troops passed through the Town yesterday. The first division of the French today. The 2d will  SEPTEMBER 3, 1781  pass tomorrow. Nothing can exceed the appearance of this Specimen which our ally has sent us of his army, whether we regard the figure of the men or the exactness of their discipline.(2)  Yesterday also arrived from his Special Mission to the Court of France Col. John Laurens. Although his success has not been fully commensurate to our wishes, he has brought with him very substantial proofs of the determination of that Court to support us. Besides a considerable quantity of Cloathing, & other valuable articles, there are upwards of 16,000 Stand of Arms. It is rather unlucky that they found it expedient to put into Boston instead of this place from Whence the distribution of them would have been so much more easy.(3)  I wish I could have concluded the intelligence without adding that Admiral Hood with 13 Sail of the line from the West Indies lately arrived at New York and after being joined by Greaves with 8 Ships put again immediately to sea. The French squadron under de Barras had previously sailed from New Port. As the expected arrival of de Grasse from the W. Indies could not be unknown to Hood, there is li[ttle] doubt that his activity is directed against the Junction of the two F. fleets. Not a word as yet of the Congress at Vienna.  I am Dr. Sir, Yrs. sincerely, J. Madison Junr.  [P.S.] I hope the issue of this campaign will compel England to a more active concurrence in the pacification, than she could be expected [to] give whilst the ideas of the American Secretary prevailed in her Councils.

Generals Washington & de Rochambau have been in Town for some days past. The French troops, and part of the American Army are moving to the Southward, the last division will pass thro' Town this day. Sr. Saml. Hood arriv'd off the Hook, and, it is said, saild again in Conjunction with Graves (21 Ships of the line) last Friday. It is likewise said Barras left Newport the 25 Ulto.

  Dear Sir, Philada Sept. 4 1781.  You have been informed before this time that the plan of the present campaign is changed from New York to the southern states. I suppose this change arose from intelligence recd. from Count de Grasse who is now every moment expected in Chesapeake bay. Genl Washington is here & a large division of the army dayly passing thro. I had yesterday the pleasure to see the first division of the French. They marched through Front & Chesnut streets by the state house and so out to the common where they encamped. The members of Congress were at the door of the state house and recd. from the officers of the army as they passed a royal salute. The ceremony on their part was to let fall the point of the sword, likewise the colours, and the members of Congress took off their hats. The engaging figure and behaviour of the officers of all ranks, their dress, the cavalry, musick, arms, artillery, the figure & behaviour of the privates, and the uniform motion of the whole, afforded the most pleasing prospect of the kind I ever saw.  I need not inform you of the return of Col Lawrence from France by way of Boston, his exertions have been great & Successfull. Our supplies from France this year amount to 20 million livers, 6 million whereof is a donation, the remainder lent us. Some of this is arrived in cash some in clothing & warlike stores, and some drawn for, and to be drawn for, in bills [of] Exchg. This will do something better than our old conti.

  Sir, Philadelphia. September 4th. 1781. I had the pleasure of receiving your favor of the 26th of last month yesterday, and am very sorry for the distresses of Virginia, tho' the ardour and unanimity of the people promise that they will not long continue. Long ere this I flattered myself that I should have heard of the Count de Grasse and Count de Barras having entered the Chesepeake with thirty-four ships of the line, and several frigates, bomb-ketches & other armed vessels. They sailed for that Bay long ago, with a considerable body of land forces, and a company of sappers and miners, having every apparatus on board for attacking fortifications. This you may depend upon. General Washington, with the whole French Army, and a large detachment of Americans are in full march for your relief; the last division passed thro' this city to day.  Colo. Laurens came to town yesterday from Boston, where he arrived in the French frigate Resolution, (1) accompanied with two others loaded with arms, ammunition & cloathing, on the 25th of August. Besides these important supplies, all for the United States, he has brought with him a large sum in specie, almost equal to our wishes. The Court of France have really exerted themselves far beyond any thing done heretofore, and have given full proof how much they have our Independance at heart. In a few weeks more, I SEPTEMBER 4, 1781  trust I shall have it in my power to mention additional evidences of their most faithful attachment: The King has written a very friendly letter to Congress, and presented their special Minister Colo. Laurens with an elegant gold box, having his picture in the lid, ornamented with diamonds &c., nearly resembling the one you had the honor of receiving.  On Saturday last, about one o'clock P.M., Sir Samuel Hood, with 22 ships of the line was seen, about 25 miles Southward of Shrewsbury, steering to the Southward; I suppose for Chesepeake. In all probability we shall soon hear of a Sea Engagement. We are at the eve of great events; may God grant them to be prosperous to us, and that they may terminate in securing to us peace, liberty and safety.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia, September 6. 1781.  Admiral de Grasse, with twenty eight Ships of the line, two 44 & 2 frigates of 32 each, and a cutter of 18 Guns, having on board four SEPTEMBER 6, 1781  thousand Troops, arrived in Chesapeake Bay on the 26th of August last. For further particulars I refer you to the Hand-Bill inclosed, which I had struck off on the occasion.(1)  Colo Laurens has come to Congress and successfully executed his mission as our special Minister at the court of Versailles. He arrived at Boston on the 26th of August in the frigate Resolute, and was accompanied by three others: they are loaded with arms, ammunition, ordnance, cloathing &c. for our army, and he has besides brought over a large sum of money in specie; the amount I am not at liberty to mention, but I can tell you it is more than one hundred thousand pounds sterling, and that more is expected. I have no official intelligence of the fact, but I am firmly perswaded, that Count de Barras, with seven Ships of the line and several Ships of inferior force, must have entered the Chesapeake on Monday last; on which day Sir Samuel Hood, with 22 Ships of the line and a great many frigates, was seen about thirty five miles to the southward of Cape Henlopen steering to the southward. We may soon expect to hear of a naval engagement, and, I flatter myself, with the surrender of Lord Cornwallis & his Army.  Permit me, my dear Sir, to present you my warmest congratulations on this glorious intelligence.

  Sir, Philadelphia, September 7. 1781 Mr. Smith this moment informs me that he is going out of Town. I have only time to congratulate you on the Arrival of the Count De Grasse at the Cheasepeake & inform you that Gist's Letter to the General is erroneous in Point of Time. By a Letter from the Marquis LeFiette to the Minister received last Evening, the Count De Grasse arrived on the Thirty first, had landed 5000 Men including Marines, the Marquis was urged to make a stroke at Cornwallis, which he could do with probability of success, but declined it as the Commander in Chief was on his way, and there was no probability of Cornwallis being able to effect an Escape. The Marquis makes no mention in his Letter of the Capture of Lord Rawden, which makes  SEPTEMBER 7, 1781  Gist's information doubtful. We are anxious to hear of Count De Barras with his fleet from Rhoad Island, who sailed from thence the 25th (as was said) to join De Grasse. General Washington was at the Head of Elke Yesterday about noon. Vessels are there ready to receive the Troops, at least most of them, & he writes that he shall loose no time in forwarding them on. Our Expectations are greatly raised, and those who are best acquainted with Cornwallis' Scituation make no doubt but his whole Army must fall into our Hands. I hope no unforeseen accidents (which are frequent in war) may deprive us of so great a Prize, which probably will put an End to the War in a short Time. Colo. Lawrance has returned from France and has been very successful in his Embassy, of which I shall inform you by Colo. Hay, who has been necessarily detained longer than he expected, but probably will set of next Day after tomorrow.

By the last post I suggested to you that our European affairs would probably bear greater delay than you apprehended.(1) What you call your temporary disability will be removed early enough, to allow you to reach France by January. From Colo. Laurens's account I am induced to believe, that Great Britain will never admit an American plenipotentiary into the congress, before which a general pacification is to be agitated, until some humiliating stroke of war and that until such admission, France will not negotiate on the subject.

  Dear Sir, Private Philadelphia,September 8,1781. I have been honored with your private letter of the 26th of August, and your official one of the same date (by Colo. Hay) for which I have many thanks to return.(1) I readily agree with you that so flagrant a breach of faith and violation of the Confederation, so soon after its ratification, as the late proceedings relative to the New Hampshire Grants has a direct tendency to destroy all confidence in that body whose engagements ought to be held Sacred. When the principles of justice once give way to those of expediency it is impossible to tell where the evil will end. Some of the Southern States although they voted for the present measures are very fearful of the consequences; and anticipate the evils that may befal their own States in consequence thereof. Had not the Southern States been invaded, 'tis my opinion, we should not have seen the present resolution; by this the New England States acquired an importance they never experienced before. I think it more than probable, that after the return of the agents from Vermont, if they should propose terms which should be thought reasonable, many of the States would endeavor to refer it to New York and New Hampshire with recommendation to relinquish their several jurisdictions (the Massachusetts having already passed a law for that purpose). I am more induced to believe this will be attempted, as many gentlemen from the Southward are fully of opinion that Congress has no authority to admit those people into the Federal Union as a separate State on the present principles. Since the departure of Ira Allen and his associates, we have had a very thin Congress, when before there was twelve States represented and one member from the thirteenth, which shews what pains were taken to carry a favorite point to the New England SEPTEMBER 8, 1781  States. Your letter to the President of Congress, with Governor Trumbull's letter and the answer from your Excellency were read by the Secretary and committed to a special Committee who have not yet reported. I had some days before moved for a special Committee to report specially on the papers and other information given relative to the commissions issued by Governor Trumbull. Mr. Sherman, the only member now here from Connecticut urged that it might be delayed till the Gov'r could be heard from, as he was satisfied the Commissions were called in and the plundering would cease; some other States supported him and the motion was lost. I conclude the Committee do not report expecting a letter from Gov'r Trumbull to Congress by the next post on the subject. You may rest assured that we shall not be inattentive to a matter in which the State is so greatly interested.(2)  Your construction of the resolutions as to the time of our present delegation is agreeable to my former opinion, tho' contrary to Mr. Duane's. At least he much doubted of the propriety of our staying longer than the 12 of Sept. General Scott has wrote to us, advising by all means not to stay longer than the 12th of Sept. (this need not be mentioned): if Mr. Duane is of my opinion, which I believe he will be, we shall continue here as long as our money will hold out, and longer we cannot. 'Tis probable some time about the first of next month, it may be prudent for us to take our departure; if we can stay longer we shall.(3)  Colo. Hay has necessarily been detained here longer than he would have been, on account of the movement of the Army. Much of the time of this week having been taken up by Congress in settling etiquettes and in paying and receiving compliments from the General Officers and Army. Count de Rochambeau ordered his whole Army to march by the City Hall and to salute Congress as a crowned head, and the President as the first prince of the blood. How do you think friend Thomas felt?(4) It has been with some difficulty that we have been able to procure the enclosed resolution(5) (which is not certified by the Secretary, the minutes not having been read since its passing) which is not so full and agreeable to our wishes as we intended. The Quarter Master has his friends, and those that justify him, tho' few in number. Eight States only are represented. One was divided, one voted against, whereby some other parts of the report was lost; to wit, that the certificates given to the State agent shall be credited to the quota of supplies required of the said State. This part being reconsidered was referred to the financier, where 'tis likely it will remain dormant till the account is settled. If we can get the certificates with the quantity of forage ascertained, we can easily have it in our power to make the discompt. By Colo. Hay I send you a little book with the Constitutions of the several States which he informed me you wanted; (6) and I shall by the first opportunity send   you the Acts of Congress as far as are printed (for want....(7) (of our) great Resourses of our Revenue. Yesterday at one Stroke 30,000 Thousand Dollars specie per annum was [s]truck of[f] from our Expenditures by dissolving the Board of Admiralty, the Honorable Navy Board at Boston, Secretaries, Agents, Clerks, House Rents &c, &c. The whole Business being transfered to the financeer Mr Morris, untill an agent of Marine Shall be appointed. A Secretary or Minister of War will soon be appointed which will make a great saving in that Department. We were fully of Opinion & I believe Colo. Hay concurred with us that it would at present answer no purpose to attempt any New regulations on the old System for settling the Quarter Master & Commissaries Accounts in our State as the financeer has given in to Congress a General Plan for settling all Accounts by which the present Board of Treasury, Chambers of Accounts, extra Chambers, Auditors &c will be broke up and a New Arrangement made. This Plan has been under consideration some Days & some Parts of it are passed & I expect it will soon be finished. So far as I am acquainted with the public Accounts I have reason to believe the System will not work when put in practice and it is nearly as expensive as the former one. I beleive however it is best to pass it or any thing else that the Business may be set about and Defects in the System may hereafter be remiedyed as they may appear to the Financeer. If the present proposed System will not work he must Try till he can get one that will. It is very evident that unless the public Accounts are soon settled, or unless the People are convinced they will soon be settled, little or no Taxes or Supplies will hereafter be recived from the States as at present each State claims to have done more than its Proportion, and offer that as an Excuse, even Pensylvania Claims that Merrit.  By Some late Accounts from Europe which many suppose Authentick, the Empress of Russia is playing with Holland offering in Excuse for her not taking a part in Support of the Conventions of the Armed Neutrality, that she will give her mediations & that after a peace takes Place Holland will Enjoy all the advantages of it. She excuses herself further 'tis said, by saying that the Declaration of war on the part of Great Brittain was prior to the Actual signing by the United States (of Holland). She has banished one of her Ministers who was greatly in favour of assisting the Neutrality against Great Brittain. We expect soon to hear from Mr Adams when likely we shall have a true & particular Account. It is so long since Mr Laurens left France, (near three Months) that he has nothing new. I am sr with the greatest esteem & respect Your Excellencies most obedt Servt. Ezra LHommedieu  ""

  Philadelphia 9th Septemr. 1781. I need not tell you, my dear General, what I felt on the critical Arrival of Count de Grass' Squadron. Accept my warmest Congratualations. The most decisive advantages may reasonably be expected from this generous & formidable Cooperation: but I will not anticipate.  The Financier has relievd my Solicitude for the New York Line. A month's pay however inadequate to their Claims will raise their Spirits, at least appease their discontent.  I have this moment dispatches from the northward particularly from General Schuyler. The Indians have within a few days revisited Coble's Kill and Schoharie, burned several houses and captivated some of the Inhabitants; and there is reason to be apprehensive that they will destroy the Grain which is doubtless their principal Object in this Incursion. General Schuyler mentions that there is not less than 80 or 90000 bushells of Wheat at Schohaire alone which he has \""in vain essayed to bring away.\""  Since your Excellency's departure we have thrown the Solitary Remnant of our marine into the Management of our Financier. It will save a Capital Expence as the Admiralty, Navy board and their Subordinate Offices are dissolved. When the number of our Ships & the Circumstances of our Treasury Justify it, the Appointment of the Minister of the marine will be seasonable. The Board of Treasury & its dependants will in a few days undergo a similar Reform. I expect those measures will prove a fruitful Source of Invective against those who have introduced and pressed them, and I am content to take my Share.  I have the pleasure to transmit this Letter by Lt. Col. Laurens. In the Execution of his late Mission he has acquired great Honour and given entire Satisfaction. From having his Report under Consideration as a member of a special Committee I had an opportunity of  SEPTEMBER 9, 1781  minute Enquiry and I am convinced he has done every thing which coud be expected, under delicate Circumstances, from an able minister. He has Justly encreased his Reputation by asking leave immediately after his Report to take the Field, and by declining any Recompence for His essential Services. A disinterestedness which forms a striking Contrast between him and some other Characters! Congress have given him a Testimonial of their Approbation which I do myself the Honour to enclose.(1) I wish it may be in your Excellency's power to distinguish Col Laurens by a Command. You may be assured it will be highly pleasing to Congress.

  Dear Sir Philadelphia 9th September 1781 We were duly honoured with your Excellency's Despatches of the 25th, 26th & 27th of August to which we shall pay all possible Attention. (1)  Your Excellency's Observations on the Vermont Business are conclusive,(2) the Effect of them would have been and still may be, a Suspension of the Controversy but this we had every Reason to believe was not the Intention or even the Wish of the Legislature from every Gentleman with whom we conversed, we were taught that any Decision was preferable to Delay; and that as internal Dissentions would arise from a Reference to our own Legislature, it would not be expedient to shift the ultimate Admission or Rejection of the Claim from the United States to those which were immediately interested. Indeed from the Terms of our Instructions we were unauthorized to countenance or interfere in any Act which was not grounded on the Merits of the Controversy with Respect to Right and the Evidence submitted to Congress, it would otherwise have been no hard Matter to give the Business the Turn your Excellency suggests-our Situation is too embarrassed to acquire any Credit in this disagreeable Subject. We shall inflexibly continue to dissent from any Propositions repugnant to our Instructions, by which we hold ourselves bound, if we succeed in procuring a Recognition and Guarantee of our remaining Territorial Rights, it is the best Compromise that we can foresee, even this will be attended with Difficulty: we hear Nothing from the Grants, and it is more SEPTEMBER 9, 1781  than probable their internal Animosities with respect to the People on the East Side of the River (who will not readily yeild their Project of Independence) will protract the Business untill the next Sessions of the Legislature.  Before the Receipt of Your Excellency's Despatches we had revived the Business of the Plunder on Long Island by Pretext of Governor Trumbull's Commission, and insisted on the Incompetency and even Impropriety of a Desire to revoke those Commissions, because it implied a Right to grant them. Mr. Sherman assured Congress that the Recommendation would have its full Effect, and as sufficient Time had not then elapsed for an Answer it ought not to be pressed, for this Reason it was postponed by the Unanimous Wish of Congress, tho' without putting any formal Question; and it rests with us to resume it the first convenient Opportunity, if Govr. Trumbull does not give the Satisfaction required of him, the Sufferers will in some Measure be redressed by the Repeal of the Sentences below which we take for granted.(3) We have attentively considered your Excellency's Observations respecting the Expiration of our Authority.(4) They have certainly great Weight; but your Wish that we should continue here 'till the 15th of Octbr. has determined us to wait as long as our Finances, will permit, which will be something Short of the Period you mention, if the Agents for the Grants appear in the mean Time, the Expedient of a Protest may be adopted.  The conduct of the Quarter Master General in West Chester County respecting Forage, is not, nor can it be justified-one dissenting and one dividing State prevented us from obtaining a Resolution agreeably to our own Wishes. Those States did not object because the Quarter Master's Principle was defensible but because a general Rule ought to be laid down which would relieve all States and Individuals under the like Circumstances, however if no Alteration is made in the Act passed yesterday it will be sufficient for our Purpose (5)-as to the Individuals being paid by Congress, it will be out of the Question 'till the publick Treasury is replenished, if the Debt is acknowledged he must be contented-if what relates to the State is assertained we shall take Credit for it. Col. Van Schaick has unquestionably been ill treated, and we approve of his not joining the army until Justice is done him, in fact Congress know not what to do for him unless by adding Two Brigadiers General to the List to raise him and Greaton up to the Rank of Hazen who has superseded them both. He cannot be permitted to retire on Halfpay by any Act of Congress which will not imply a Disgrace. We shall try what can be done, in the mean Time he is paying a Visit to a Friend in New Jersey where he waits the Event.(6)  Doctor McCrea is arrived and from his Services entitled to our Assistance. Dr. Young we have not yet seen, tho' we are well acquainted with his Merit. Your Excellency's Commands with respect   to them we shall execute with great Pleasure as far as may be practicable.(7)  We congratulate your Excellency on the Arrival of Count De Grasse in the Chesepeake with 28 Ships of the Line he has landed from his Fleet 5000 Troops including 1000 Marines. General Washington is now at the Head of a formidable Army and Lord Cornwallis so effectually circumscribed by Sea and Land that it is out of his Power to retreat. There is no Doubt but he will make as obstinate a Defence as about 5000 Troops will enable him; but his Lordship seems once more to be placed in Circumstances from which Nothing but the sudden Approach of a superior naval Armament can extricate him. We speak with Submission to divine Providence. For the Particulars of this and other Intelligence your Excellency will be pleased to be referred to the Collection of News Papers enclosed.  Since our Arrival here the Plan for choosing an Agent instead of a Secretary of Marine has been adopted, but the Number of our Ships still decreasing by a recent Loss and being reduced to two we have transferred the Business at present to the Financier. The Treasury Board will be dissolved and a Plan more simple and expeditious instituted, it is now forming into an Ordinance the Substance having already been agreed to. Col. Laurence our special Minister to the Court of Versailles is returned and has executed his Mission with great Propriety and Success, it has been the Means of enabling us among other good Things to advance the New York Line, Officers and Men a Month's Pay in Specie. Yesterday they received it at the Head of Elk, we suffered the greatest Anxiety 'till this Object was accomplished, for the Discontent of the Corps was great and just as well among the Officers as Soldiers.

  Dear Sir Sepr. 11. 1781. I have already acknowledged the Receipt of your Favors of July 30 & Aug 21 with those for B-D-& G.(1) Hazard will have answered the 1st. You will herewith receive an Answer to the last and the others will not be unnoticed. I have said that they were very well SEPTEMBER 11, 1781  come tho they were rather Foundations of Hope than Messengers of Success.  The Mail of Aug. 28 going hence was taken but I do not find by my Almanac that I wrote a single Letter. I think however I did send one, insignificant, to my Children.(2) Privateer Commissions went from Mr. Thompson to Mr. Avery,(3) which was a very unfortunate Circumstance.  I have already told you that I must Consent to your standing by me in the Case of 140 Dollars, letting the final Damages fall on me. Mr. R Morris has the Letter of our Court and the Report of a Committee upon it respecting the old Money under his Consideration, and yesterday was referred to him an Instruction of June 30th recd. only Augst. 30th respecting the same Business.(4) I know him to be strongly for Justice, and clear that it may easily be had. The Movements of the Army press him greatly so that he has not Leisure yet to report, but in fact, the Business is already in Train by his pressing the Delinquent States for their Balances on all Requisitions. The new had a Shock at the southward but from 15 it suddenly got to be 4 for 1 as Major Burnett tells me. It is here less than 2 and Mr. Morris says must be near par shortly.  In one of those Letters not yet answered you speak of 184 49/80 Dollars, and 1010 Livres, in another you mention the first Sum even 184 Ds. and Paper to procure 210 Livres yet say you shall credit 140 Dollars. I now owe 147 for Board and some little borrowed of the same Person, besides 26 borrowed for Expences and perhaps 16 to Tailors and Shoemakers. How under the Heavens am I to get at this with Massachusetts Paper which is here, now, not at all passing, and, with you next to nothing. You speak of my seing Boston. I own no Horse or I might run away from my Debts and ask Charity on the Road for a Delegate of Mass. to enable him to reach Home. But really my Friend are you not in opinion that it is a ridiculous Way of proving that I did not keep Madam Clymar, to go and spend a Number of Months with my Family without one Shilling of Income the Day after my arrival in Boston, or without the least Hint from any Man that he will employ me in any Way within the Compass of my Abilities. Bad as my present state is it compares well by the Side of nothing. I have not the most distant Right to complain of the Smallness of my Pay while it is equal to that of my Colleagues and is justly liquidated. I have even Obligations for particular Attention that has been given by the Court to my Family. Is it a Crime to serve here as a Delegate for a Living more than to do it in the Church or in an Academy? I thought not when I undertook it. Nor is it a Crime that I endeavor to bear patiently that Injury which the War has brought on my Family in common with many others. I see no Way by fair means of living well at Home without a Capital. I foresee Banishment from my native Province to some of the newer Quarters where   Land is easily to be had and where Education may ensure some Office. To quit all Connection with the Contest in this Stage of it and take Horse & a pr. of Saddle Bags to make Something handsome as the Phrase is out of Credit meerly does not fall in with some fixed Principles to which I have been accustomed. More than one whom I esteem and whom I doubt not to call my Friends have appeared to advise my \""paying a Visit to Massachusetts.\"" I greatly Wish to know what are the imagined Utilities that may balance the inevitable Injuries which I have hinted. Do be candid with me if you have heard Conversation on that Head.  Mr. J A has Power to form a Treaty of Alliance with Holland to make it Triple or Quadruple for the Purposes of this War.(5)  Mr. J Laurens can give no News of him so late as what a Capt. Mason brought, who had been Captured. Mr. A took public Parade about the 24th of May.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia Sepr. 11. 1781 I have had the honor of receiving your several letters of the 16th and 27th August and would have answered last post, but for being absent in the country.  It is with great pleasure I congratulate you on the safe arival of comte de Grasse with 28 sail of the line in the Chesapeake-for farther particulars I beg leave to refer you to Genl. Gists letter in the inclosed paper, since which we have only the same confirmed by a letter from the Marquis.  Our river craft have been so destroyed or taken that the greater part of Genl. Washingtons army will have to march all the way by land. It is expected that about this evening the comr. in chief will reach the Marquis to take command.  As Cornwallis did not fight immediately it is supposed he will act on the defensive, in hopes of relief. We have no certain account of the destination or arival of comte de Barras in the Chesapeake. The Minister of France appears easy on this point-I therefore conjecture that squadron may have other objects. Last Wensday Adml. Graves fleet consisting of 19 or 20 of the line were seen off the capes of Delaware standing to the southward, which is the last we have heard of them.  The extreme heat of the season and the fatague which Genl. Greenes army have undergone induced him to take post at the high hills of Santee, thirty five miles below Camden, in order to rest and refresh his troops, where he will probably remain 'till about this time. Genls Sumter and Marian were very successful in striking the enemys post at Dorchester, Monks Corner &c-but Genl. Greenes distance was so great that they were obliged to retire to Santee.  The enemy moved from Orrangeburg up to the Congarie. Genl Greene has hopes of giving them a stroke in due season.  Reports say that Arnold is burning & plundering in your State. SEPTEMBER 11, 1781  Sundry descents from New York on the country may reasonably be expected, otherwise Sir Henry cannot answer it to his Court. We might have apprehensions of this City could he see his retreat elligible.  Colo. Laurens has executed his mission with admirable effect and dispatch. He has brought to Boston 17,000 stand of arms, a large quantity of cloathing-military Stores, medicene &c &c. He has also brought from the coffers of our ally two million five hundred thousand livres. This under the direction of Mr. Morris will give vigor to our military operations. On the whole our affairs at present wear a pleasing aspect; but let us remember that naval and military operations are attended with all those contingencies and uncertainty to which human affairs are liable.  I beg Mrs. Huntington may accept my best compliments.  With great respect & esteem I am, My dear Sir, Your Most Obt. Humble Servt. Wm. Sharpe  P.S. I shall depart hence the 1st Octr.  ""

  Sir Philadelphia Sepr 13th. 1781 I received Your Letter of the 27th ulto. by Mr Brown. Am glad to hear that your Health is repaired. General Washington and the French Army & part of the American Troops passed through this City on their way to Virginia. Count De Grass is arrived in the Cheasapeak with 28 Ships of the Line and Some Frigates, and about 5000 Land forces which landed South of James River and joined our Army. We have no news of a junction of the Fleet from Rhode Island with Count De Grasse-but 'tis Supposed that Lord Cornwallis and his army are So blocked up on every Side that they cant escape; time will Soon determine that Event. Our latest accounts from the Southward are that the Enemy are confined to Charlestown and Savannah, that S. Carolina & Georgia have reassumed Civil Government, tho' we have not received official accounts of all the Posts in S. Carolina being Evacuated. Col. John Lawrence performed the whole of the business that he was charged with to good Satisfaction, he brings no accounts of political affairs in Europe. He says his father is yet confined in the Tower, but his friends are allowed to SEPTEMBER 13, 1781  visit him. That Col. John Trumbull is also confined but his friends have access to him. The direction of our Navy is committed to the Superintendant of Finance till further Order. It was agreed to appoint an Agent of Marine with one Clerk the agent to have 1500 dollars per annum, and ballots were taken but no person Elected.  There is a new arrangement of the Treasury department. There is to be a Controller, a suitable number of auditors & Clerks to Liquidate accounts, a Register to keep the public accounts, a Treasurer to receive and pay out the monies, on the orders of Congress or the Superintendant of Finance. The office of treasurer of Loans is abolished & the duties of it annexed to the office of Treasurer of the united States. Col. Grayson has resigned his office in the Board of War. Five states are unrepresented, the President was desired to write to the Executives, to Send on their Delegates-but his Letters fell into the hands of the Enemy by the Post being taken at Pompton, an Escort is Since ordered between Morristown & Fishkill. Congress have directed the Committee on the Post office to confer with the Superintendant of Finance & Post Master General, and report a new arrangement. The Superintendant thinks the Postage ought to be reduced to what it was originally & Some of the officers discharged, and Franks to be taken off-or put under a different regulation, but thinks it must be kept in the hands of the public during the war. Something I hope will Soon be done. We have a report that New London is burnt but dont fully credit it.(1) I hope our people on the Sea Coast will be on their Guard, for I imagine that the Enemy will attempt to make what depretations they can in the absence of our main Army.

  Dear Sr. (1) Philadelphia Sept. 14 1781. I was favoured with your kind Letter by Doctor Young, and a little before by Mr. Van Voort, I received one from Mr Cuyler, requesting the Relinquishment of the Location to the Island agreable to your Information. By this Conveyance I have retained him for Answer  SEPTEMBER 14, 1781  \""That I was sorry that I could not consistant with my Interest & Engagements comply with his Request, that a friend I met with at Albany last Winter (a Refugee) advanced the money to me to make the Location expecting I might make something by it hereafter and purchase some lands adjoining, which I concluded were the same that he had secured, that should I give up the Location he would expect the Preference, and that at present I could not consent to part with the Island which I had reason to believe was an advantageous Location trusting to the Location of Other Lands hereafter in Lieu thereof. That it would give me great pleasure to Oblige him in this Particular, at the same time I was assured that he would not accept of any offer from me (under my present Circumstances) contrary to my Interest.\"" If you think it advisable you can tell him that he & I had one motive in Locating vizt making Profit, & likely I should pursue that Object and probably would sell it hereafter if I could get an Price to my Mind, but in this act your own Judgment.  You will no doubt expect considerable news by this Conveyance, but I fear I can give you Nothing New to be depended on. We have had nothing from the Marquis's Army Since the Landing the Troops from De Grasse's Fleet. It is beleived in town that Count De Barras has joined De Grasse if so there are now in the Bay 35 ships of the Line. It is likewise reported to day with probability of Truth that Admiral Digby this week was on the Coast & that Troops were imbarking at New York. With this addition the English fleet will be 29 Ships of the Line, should there be a naval Engagement perhaps it will be the greatest ever known. It is probable that the Circumstance of the french Squadrons being in the Bay may give them an Advantage besides their Superiority in Number of Ships & Guns. General Washington before this (about Wednesday last) must have arrived at the Marquis Camp in Virginia & probably the Troops that went by water, which were mostly Americans. At the Head of Elk, they, both officers & privates received one months Pay in hard money, our poor Line would scarce beleive their own Eyes. This has given them Spirits & put them in good Humour. The Arrival of Colo Lawrens with Arms, other Military Stores, Cloathing & Hard Money was exceeding fortunate. Doctor Young I expect will succeed in his application, & probably will leave Town next Week, by him I shall do myself the Pleasure to communicate any thing New we may then Have. I expected by this Time to have returned, but it being the Opinion of many high in office in Our State that we ought to stay longer being justified in so doing, by the Resolutions of Our Appointment; 'tis likely we shall continue till sometime in the Beginning of next month: altho we shall be obliged to spend on our private funds. A New Arrangement has taken Place for settling the public Accounts agreable to a Plan of the Superintendant of Finance, by which means the Board of Treasury, Chambers of Ac-  counts &c will soon be at an End. This System will be more simple and less Expensive than the former. It may not be expedient to mention this at present as it may impede the public Business if any thing should happen that might prevent its taking place according to Expectation. Except the public Accounts are soon settled or the People have reason to beleive they soon will be, little specific supplies can be expected from the States in the future, as each state claims to have done more than its proportion. Paper Money, I mean the New Continental, has appreciated in this State from ten for one, to Two for one, the present Exchange. I should be glad to see the same in our State, but do not expect it, unless the New Legislature, should be more inclined to call it in by Taxes, than I fear they will be.  Since writing the above I have heard that it is reported in Town by persons from the Southward that Cornwallis on hearing of the Movement of Genll. Washington put his Troops on half Allowance, that he had 1000 Negros sick with Small pox which proved very mortal among them, and that his army was very sickly. This probably may be true, but wants Confirmation, as it comes thro' many Hands. The present is a most important Crisis, should we be sucessful in Virginia an honorable Peace probably would be the Consequence, otherwise Great Brittain might be induced to continue the War another Campaign.  We have nothing late from Genl Green. His Successes have been remarkable, and civil Government is now established in South Carolina & Georgia. I send you the Papers altho they contain nothing important more than probably you have seen. You will excuse this hasty & incorrect Letter as I have not time to look over it. Present my Compliments to Mrs. Tayler & her little Daughter.  I am, Dear Sr with great Respect, Your most Hum Sevt,  Ezra LHommedieu ""

I am possessed of the Gazette now from which for yr. Satisfaction I have extracted all the Rest.(1) That Fellow has the Contents of a fifth Mail; but, the Letters were so very insignificant towards State Purposes, that he is reduced to the Necessity of pretending to furnish Entertainment by the \""verbatim\"" and \""literatim\""  SEPTEMBER 14, 1781  Exhibition of them, and has consequently made large Alterations in the Spelling, capitalizing & Pointing.  You must be expecting great News from this Quarter; but, depend upon it, you shall not catch me giving Baltimore Stories.(2) I will send nothing but what shall be authentic. We have much to hope from regular movements; and I believe the Plan of our Allies is so laid as not to make rash Attempts necessary thro Pinch of Time.  The movements of the Army have so multiplied Business upon the Financier that he has not yet reported on that Point to which yr. Letter of May 20 referred; (3) but, his Scheme is prepared, and you may rely upon it he intends Justice.  I do not find by yr. last Letters whether you are decided as to the Delegation but you seem to think me so as to returning Home. I have been stimulated to such a Determination but have not yet come into it. Prudence on a private Scale absolutely forbids it; and Justice to the Public is against it also: I mean against a Visit not a Resignation. For I must either make that Visit and remain totally without any Sort of Income; or I must go into some temporary Means of supporting my Family during the Period which would not be a reputable one perhaps considering me as an Existing Delegate. I should not be ashamed to accept a stated Clerkship in a Counting House if I was out of the Congressional Line but to act temporarily in that Way meerly to enable me to look at Boston would naturally drawn forth unpleasing Reflexions. If I can contrive to mix some Interest with my Pleasure in a suitable Way I would gladly spend some Weeks at Home.

  Sir, (private) Philadelphia, September 15. 1781 The following intelligence, tho' not derived thro' any official or authentic channel, appears to be of sufficient consequence to be communicated to you without delay. I have just now received intelligence, that a Brig arrived at New-York on Monday last from En- SEPTEMBER 15, 1781  gland, with Dispatches for Admiral Digby; she sailed nine days after the Admiral. On Tuesday two Frigates came up, who announced the arrival of Admiral Digby on the coast (the number of Men of war not known) with a Fleet consisting of upwards of an hundred Sail, having Troops on Board, the amount not mentioned: these Frigates returned for the Admiral in a few hours.  Two dispatch Vessels had arrived from Cornwallis after the appearance of the french Fleet in Chesapeake-Between thiry & forty large Transports lay at New-York on Tuesday ready to sail, and more were getting ready-Sir Henry Clinton is said to be going with them. Their destination unknown but conjectured to be either for Virginia or Delaware Bay. From forty to sixty Negroes are sent on Board these vessels, who are said to belong to persons in Virginia, and are to be returned to their respective Masters by the advice of Lord Cornwallis.  On Sunday Arnold returned to New-York from an Expedition to New-London in Connecticut, leaving his Troops on Board the Transports in Huntington Bay. He has destroyed all the Stores & Shipping at that place, except six vessels that escaped by favor of the wind. The two fortifications there were taken by Assault, and all put to the sword, except eleven men who had hid themselves. After plundering New-London he burnt it, leaving only three or four houses standing. It is said he is going on another Expedition immediately.  The Minister of France will communicate this intelligence to Count de Grasse. An anxiety to be serviceable induces me to give you this information, tho' the evidence of the truth of it is not quite satisfactory, as I have not a line respecting any part of it from any person officially, not even of the destruction of New-London. General Heath indeed, in a Postcript to his letter of the 5th instant, mentions, that 26 large Ships were seen sailing up the Sound opposite to Stamford on the Sunday preceding, but he had learned nothing more of them.  By the english papers, as well as Rivington's Gazette, Digby's Fleet is said to consist of ten Ships of the line; therefore I do not think they can exceed that number, tho' they may be less.  There are three thousand Militia to be forthwith embodyed in this State, and the like number in New Jersey. The requisition of Congress has been already received by the respective governors, and orders are gone out in consequence.(1)  Never had we occasion for more wisdom, vigilance and activity. I pray God to preserve your health, and to guide, direct and protect us all in this hour of trial; and am, Sir, with unfeigned respect & esteem, Your Excellency's Most obedient & most humble Servant,  Thos M:Kean  ""

'Tis Supposed that Lord Cornwallis and his army are So blocked up that they cannot escape being captured. Col.

  Sir, Sept 15. 1781 You desire to know my Opinion with regard to the sentiments & conduct of Congress in the Advances made to members on Account of their States in the fall of the year 1779. I have examined the journals to assist my recollection. The practice of making advances to individual members was first introduced from necessity & was practised partially & sparingly, afterwards it became so general that most of the members & states seemed to depend upon it. Some of the states seemed at last to disapprove the measure, and as far as I can recollect the members from New Jersey first testified against it. And I well remember that some members seemed pleased with the vote of Congress for stopping farther emissions, as this would naturally put an end to such grants. However money was still granted to members on their application, but it always appeared to me to be given with reluctance after that vote, & the reluctance seemed to  SEPTEMBER 17, 1781  encrease as the money in the treasury diminished, until at last it produced a regular motion to put a total stop to such advances. This, from the circumstances of individuals who were too far distant from home to receive immediate supplies, was at that time waved. But soon after a recommendation was sent to the states to make provision for their respective delegates.(1) The above is the most succinct & satisfactory account I can give of the matter.

  Dr. Sir, Philadelphia September 17th. 1781 I arrived here on Friday Evening, (1) but on going into Congress, was mortifyed by finding Dr. Witherspoon was gone home, so that I am here alone & the State unrepresented.  Enclosed your Excellency has an intercepted Letter,(2) sent us among others, by Genll. Greene.  SEPTEMBER 17, 1781  The Writer is a recruiting Officer in New York, and has Agents in our State for supplying him with recruits.  Your Excellency will undoubtedly take proper Measures to secure MacNeal, who may still be at Kingwood, and I think some Notice should be taken of Harrison, who is Mr. Erskins Book keeper.  I dare not write the News of the Day, as there is nothing to be depended on. Various Reports of the French Fleet sailing & beating the English; but no certainty.  We recd. a Letter from the Comr. in Chief from Dumfries.(3) He expected to Join the Marquis on Friday last.  I have the honor to be with due Respect, Your Excellency's Most Obedt. Hble Serv. Elias Boudinot  Sept. 19. No News in Congress. I see a Letter recd this Day from Annapolis, that informs, that Count de G[rasse] had gone out to sea leaving 4 74 Gun Ships in the Harbor.  That the English slipped in & attacked the 4 Ships, who behaved nobly, till the Count returning put the English to flight. After this Mons De Barras joind the Count. He took on his passage a 44 gun Ship, 2 frigates & 2 Transports.  The Privateer Congress arrived to day, with an English Sloop of War of 18 Guns the Savage.  ""

  Sir Philadelphia 17th Septr. 1781. On Friday last his Excellency General Washington joined the Marquis de la Fayette; and we are fully convinced that nothing but a Miricle can rescue Lord Cornwallis and his Army from our Hands. By Letters from Baltimore we are informed that Admiral Greaves lately made an Attack upon the French Fleet in the Chesepeak, and was repulsed; That the next day Count de Grass put to Sea, leaving two Seventy fours and a Frigate to block up the Entrance of York River, and attacked the British; that a severe Conflict ensued, in wch. the noble Count dispersed his Antagonists' Fleet; that he cap- SEPTEMBER 17, 1781  tured two seventy fours and three Frigates, and sent them into the Chesepeak, with seven of his own Ships, and was pursuing the Fugitives. This Information is not official, but has every Circumstance inducing Credibility. Count de Barras had not joined by the last Advices, but this Event will place him beyond Danger. Admiral Digby is hourly expected with a Squadron from six to ten Ships of the Line; his Arrival will make no Difference. Sir Henry Clinton is on the west End of Long Island with four Thousand Troops ready for an Expedition-Philadelphia is thought to be his Object.  We shall want about Eight hundred Dollars to enable us to finish our Accounts in Philadelphia, and return to Rhode Island in November. We are sensible the Sum will appear large; but we cannot avoid it. We are governed by the strictest Frugality, as our Accounts will shew, when exhibited; but the necessary Expenditures here are very great.

  Sir Philadelphia 17th Septr. 1781 Your Letter of the 25th Ulto. at Cambden to Congress I have been honor'd with the Sight of.(1) The tragical Exit of Colo. Hayne has excited universal Abhorrence in this Quarter. In affairs so delicate and important it is very difficult to embrace and pursue with Equanimity the most eligible Measures. Those intimately connected are very much addicted to furious Passion and call upon Mankind for immediate Revenge. Refusal may be construed into Timidity or Reglect [Neglect?] and the Mind reclines in sullin Quietude. Time however and rational Reflection will restore our Sensibilities to their native Tone, and admit Philosophy into a Suppression of the inordinate Sallies of Humanity. These Observations will strictly apply when I inform you that speedy, ample and severe Retaliation has been demanded in Congress by the Countrymen of that unfortunate Gentleman. Deliberate Bodies, supreme Legislators should be actuated by general Principles, and never feel the Motives urging to particular Recrimination but upon such Occasions as are calculated to excite the Astonishment, the Admiration and Eclat of the Universe. Sufficient is it in appeasing the Manes Of one virtuous Citi- SEPTEMBER 17, 1781  zen that a commanding General should sacrifice a few British Officers. This, my worthy Friend, I am persuaded you have done. The Stroke in Belfour (2) was political; and if the War is protracted with a View to Conquest and Subjugation, his Conduct must be highly approved upon Principles of Utility; but the same Considerations must induce us to an ample Revenge. This Execution must have ultimately resulted from Lord Cornwallis's Orders while in South Carolina. Many a worthy Victim has been destined to his sanguinary Views. Should the Fortune of War place that nobleman in our Power, then Congress may with Propriety, and I am confident will, give to the World a stricking Instance of Retaliation upon general Principles. Nothing but decided Firmness can restrain the Barbarity of British Insolence and Cruelty. Arnold has lately burnt New London, and murdered upwards of seventy of the best Inhabitants; his own Loss was much greater; but the Attack was so sudden and unexpected that the Militia had not time to collect in Force. I hope the Period is nigh in which we may burn Officers in Return for the Conflagration of defenceless Villages.  I have attended with Pleasure to your Observations upon the Rules of Promotion established by Congress. In a Government formed of federated Republics, it is impossible to obtain the best possible Systems. The Army being partly continental and partly State, a Combination of Interests, almost incompatible with each other, occur and Convenience becomes the controuling Principle. However, when we reflect that in promoting in the Line of a State at large, one Casualty will only transfer one Officer from each Corps, your Reasoning will appear too theoretic to induce a partial Influence. How noble are the Exertions of our generous Ally! The Fleet and Army now acting in America are immense. Nothing less than a Miracle can save Lord Cornwallis and his Army. So great a Victory will give a finishing Turn to our political Maneuveres and compell Great Britain to acknowledge our Independence. We have Just heard that Admiral Greaves has tried his Skill in attacking the Fleet of Count de Grasse, and has met with a severe Repulse. This is probable, and if true, will greatly facilitate the closing Scene of the Drama. Sir Henry Clinton has four Thousand Troops on the West End of Long Island prepared for an Expedition. Philadelphia is thought by many to be the object. This State and New Jersey are called upon for three thousand Militia each. I suppose they will produce them. Great Events will mark the present Year, and I believe, Heaven is about to crown our Efforts with the most brilliant Success, and plunge Great Britain into the deepest Humility in Return for her insupportable Haughtiness. Your Scenes, my good Friend, have displayed a Variety of Colors. Distress has surrounded you on every Side; but you have tryumphed in the midst of Weakness. What in a common Mind would have fixed Despair, in you has  SEPTEMBER 18, 1781  paved the Way to unfading Laurels. I have often commiserated my Friend, while I have admired the Hero, but convinced that Heaven has designed you in some future Period, when the Glories of a [ . . . ] must mingle with their native Skies, to command the Armies of America, I conceive it a divine Favor that you should be thus taught in the School of Adversity. Apropo-I have lately been honored with a Letter from your amiable Lady;(3) She was in fine Health and Spirits; but a little chagrined at your long Absence. You know she possesses Ambition and Philosophy; and I am certain she is as happy as her Situation will admit of-Not a Word about going to the Southward. I determine in my Way home, which will be in November, to make her a Visit at Westerly, and tell her she must not expect to see you 'till the Toilet will be ornamented with the Olive Branch.

  My dear Sir, Phila. Sept. 18th. 1781 I was very ill in the Country at a Place of Mr Hills when the last Post returned from the southd. & did not get to Town before Wednesday Night, so that I had not an opportunity of Answering your favor of the 7th Inst.  I congratulate you on the arrival of the French Fleet in the Chesepeake, They will be the cause of the distribution of much hard Money, for Beef & Flour, part of which will I presume Center where it is much wanted I mean in Maryland. Hence forward we must look to that Hemisphere for News. It is reported and indeed inserted by Rivington in his Paper that Adl. Digby with 10 Sail of the Line is on the Coast. If he is, there must be hardknocks. If Clinton cannot throw in succours to Lord Cornwallis, I think he must fall, especially if Virga. exerts herself who at present has not 1000 Regular Troops in all parts. What you say as to Senators is very true, & I wish every man would cautiously & conscensiously view the constitution, & act by it, as you will do. It would be now too late to comply with your request in making out a List, but I sincerely wish you to be one of the body, you would have less trouble than in the other House. I make no doubt but that you will make a good choice and notwithstanding Mr. Chase's personal Enmity to some of the late Members I cannot help thinking but that he must Wish to See a good Senate as the strong security of the Liberty & property of the Citizens of the State. I expect his reply to Mr Carroll will come out about the time of the Election.(1) As soon as it is made, be pleased to enclose me a list of names in the Order they stand as chosen. As to my own part it would not occasion the smallest uneasiness to me were I to be one of the old ones that may be left out. I think Dick Ridgeley if he could make it convenient to Act would make a good member of Senate & the  SEPTEMBER 18, 1781  Courts and assembly seldom set at the same time so that I cannot see why he may not. I expect that Coll Barnes has declined. Mr Chase attacked his understanding so pointedly, that I immagine the Coll is quite disgusted with all public business. I hear that our friend TW has been attacked & severely beat by some person in the disguise of a Drummer pretending to charge him with Crim[inal] Con[versation] with his Wife. No late News from Europe altho a Frigate in 33 days is arrived with dispatches for the Minister. The dispatches bear date the 28th. The Emperor was to be in Paris the day after. This does not look like a Rupture between him and his Brotherly in law. The Congress is still talked of but the King of England persists in his former determination that American independance shall not be mentioned at it. So that it is probable We must fight on.

  Dr. Sr. Phila. 18th Sept. 1781 I recd. your Letter of the 10th inclosing several from Col. Stewart. No apology wod. have been necessary but from the particular state of our finances which requires that the Post office maintain itself and the complaints from the Post master are frequent that too many Letters pass free. Col Stewart however being of the Military to whom indulgences of the sort should be allowed if to any the transgression of the rule is the more excuseble and as I presume you were ignorant of the fact and it being the first offence you are I think fairly intitled to the benefit of clergy. The 5th day after the Ct. de Grasses arrival in the Bay we had an account of it. Genl. Washington who had just left us met it at Chester. We hear by different private accounts that the British fleet had attempted to dispossess the French of the Bay and were repulsed with the loss of one 74. If this be true the event is important and serves more effectually to establish that naval Superiority upon which our success must depend. Arnold with bet[ween] 1500 & 2000 Troops from N. York went up the Sound and landed at New London, attacked and carryed fort Trumbull by general assault and put great part of the Garrison to the sword. Near 80 are killed, abt. 30 wounded and near 40 prisoners. A party of his Troops under a Col. Montgomery at the same SEPTEMBER 18, 1781  time took the fort on the opposite side the River. They then plundered the Town, burnt the Houses near the Water and carryed of the vessells in the harbour. Accounts from New York also say there are 4000 troops on the W. end of Long Island ready for embarkation and the transports waiting to receive them there it is given out are for Virga. but many suspect this City the object. From the same place we also hear that a frigate lately arrived with information that Adm. Digby was on the Coast. This is not yet confirmed but if he shod. and the Ct. De Grasse had 27 ships of the line exclusive of Ct. Barras's squadron from Rhode Island and this last shod. be united with the former there can be no danger as the French will still be greatly superior even if Digby has 10 ships of the line tho' it is generally thought he will bring but six when he comes. Upon the whole we have good reason to expect success agt. Cornwallis and subduing him we may look forward to more important consequences. Adieu. Yr. obed Sert. Jos. Jones  ""

  Dear Sir Philada. Sepr. 18th. 1781 I was yesterday favored with yours of the 10th instant.(1) The various reports arrived of late from Chesapeake prepared us for a confirmation from our correspondents of a fortunate rencontre between the 2 fleets. A continuation of these reports although unsupported by any authentic evidence still keeps up the public anxiety. We have not heard a word of de Barras. The arrival of Digby is far from being certain, and the circulating reports have reduced his force to six ships of the line. The preparations at New York for some movement are pretty well attested. The conjectures of many are directing it against this City, as the most practicable & important object within the reach of Clinton. The successful blow struck by the parricide Arnold against the Town of New London is described as far as the particulars are known here in the inclosed gazettes. There have been several arrivals of late from Europe with very little intelligence of any kind & with none from official sources. It all relates to the junction of the French & Spanish fleets, for the purpose of renewing the investiture of Gibralter, and enterprising something against Minorca. Thus the selfish projects of Spain not only withholds from us the co-operation of their armaments, but diverts in part that of our Allies, & yet we are to reward her with a cession of what constitutes the value of the finest part of America.  Genl. Washington & the Ct. de Rochambeau with the forces under them have I presume by this time got within Virginia. This revolution in our military plan can not fail to produce great advantages to the Southern department and particularly to Virginia, even if the immediate object of it should be unexpectedly frustrated. The presence of the Commander in chief with the proportion of our force which will always attend him, will better protect the Country against the depredations of the Enemy although he should be followed by troops from N. Y. which wd. otherwise remain there, than it has hitherto been, will leave the Militia more at leisure to pursue their occupations at the same time that the demands of the Armies will afford a sure market for the surplus provisions of the Country, will diffuse among them a share of the gold & silver of our Ally & I may now say of our own of wsh. their Northern Brethren have hitherto SEPTEMBER 18, 1781  had a monopoly which will be peculiarly grateful to them after having been so long gorged with depreciating paper; and as we may suppose that the Ships of our Ally allotted for our service will so long as his troops remain in the S. States be kept in Chesapeak, it will revive the trade thro' that channel, reduce the price of imported necessaries & raise the staple of the Country once more to its proper value.

  Dear Sir Philadelphia Sepr. 18. 1781. I wrote you on the 11th by Mr. Brown. The affair of the infamous Arnold at New London is very serious. Surely that villian will not be permitted to go unpunished even in this life.  There are vague reports via New York that Adml. Digby with six ships of the line is on the coast. From several paragraphs in british papers there is reason to apprehend it may be true.  Several days past Sir Henry with about 4000 troops have been on the west end of Long Island ready to embark, as soon some obstacles are removed. It is presumed that Adml. Greaves is gone against Count de Grasse in order to open the communication with Cornwallis. I am in hopes they will fail in this project.  We have not received any official accounts from the Marquis since the commr. in chief passed this place. We are not certain that Count de Barras has joined de Grasse or what is become of him.  Yesterday the City was ringing with reports from Baltimore and the eastern Shore that the enemys fleet had entered the bay, but were driven out and dispersed by the french who were in pursuit of them, and it is added, they had captured and sent into the bay two british 74s and one or two frigates. You know the credit that is generally due to Baltimore intelligence, yet there is a great air of authenticity in those reports. Genl. Washington would reach the Marquis about friday last, so that we need not look for official accounts for two or three days to come.  I suppose Cornwallis means to stand a siege otherwise he would have endeavoured to fight his way out before this time. Our troops that went by water sailed from the head of elk a week ago.  On the 25th of last month Genl. Greene was at Camden, where he intended to cross the Wateree and take a favorable position to strike the enemy who were posted on the Congaree.  SEPTEMBER 18, 1781  Genl. Greene is like to get more effectual aid from North Carolina than he expected.  By a private letter which I received from Genl. Greene yesterday I am happy to find that the conduct of Govr. Burke is satisfactory to him.  I beg Mrs. Huntington to accept my best compliments.  With the highest esteem I have the honor to be, Dear Sir, Your most Obt. Humble Servt. Wm. Sharpe  P.S. I have this moment heard by two private letters just received from Baltimore and the western shore that Count de Barras had arived and brought in with him one 44 two frigates & two transports captured from the enemy-that the enemy had appeared in the bay and were driven out. On the whole I believe there has been some hurry(1) which issued in our favour. W. S.  ""

Excellency's favor of the 2d Inst. with its enclosures by Post.(1)  We with great Sincerity return Congratulations to your Excellency and our Country on the happy event of the arrival of so large a reinforcement to our aid, and felicitate them on the Pleasing prospect of Complete Success-not doubting but that the Ardor of our Countrymen on this occasion to cooperate with our Allies, will equal [their] Generous efforts to relieve us. We are informed that our Army on the North River is daily increasing by large accessions of recruits from the Eastern States, and is now in a very respectable Situation as to Numbers,(2) Sufficiently so we hope to keep the Enemy in New York in Cheque notwithstanding the powerfull reinforcement which has marchd to the Southward with the Commander in Chief, however, from the Enemy's Possessing the Command of the Water in that Quarter we are Sorry to inform you it has not been in the power of our Army to prevent them from sending a Considerable detachment to New London in Connecticut, where Mr. Arnold, who Commanded, Landed and attacked a fort Garrisond by about two hundred & fifty men, which, (after a Severe Conflict in which he was twice repulsed) he carried, and put the Greatest part of the Garrison to the Sword; his loss is estimated at near two Hundred men killd, wounded &.c. After seting fire to the SEPTEMBER 18, 1781  Towns of New London and Groton which were in a great measure consumed he reimbarked, and tis said is returnd to New York. We are also Sorry to Inform you that the frigate of our Ally (the Magicienne), in going out of the Harbour of Boston with a Convoy of American Vessels was attacked by a Superior force of the Enemy and taken after an obstinate and Gallant defense, in which she gave time to her Convoy to escape. By the best accounts we have from N York-the Enemy are preparing an Embarkation of troops-whose destination it is supposed will depend much on the Success of the operations of their fleet to the Southward-tho, some are of opinion that they mean to extend their burning Plan to this City. A large Body of Militia from this State and Jersey are orderd to hold themselves in readiness to oppose such an attempt shd. it be undertaken. We have reports that a Squadron of Men of War under the Command of Ad. Digby is arrived on this Coast-the report seems Probable but wants Confirmation-it is Supposed to consist of not less than Six and not more than ten Ships of the line, tis said he is to take the Command of the whole fleet on his arrival. By some intercepted letters we find there are great discontents in New York at Sr. Henry Clintons Conduct-that they are much distressed for want of Men-giving Six Guineas bounty for Men for three Months-that Arnold has been greatly disappointed in raising his Legion which after all his promises and efforts amounts at present to little more than forty Men the chief of them officers, and that even that number is daily diminishing-they seem to expect he will be laid aside. Mr. Finnies letters shall be handed to Col. Petit, and every exertion in our power used to procure him and the State redress;(3) But in order to ensure Success in this attempt, we cannot too strongly inculcate the necessity of the accounts of the state and of his department being adjusted, and sent on to the office of Finance for Settlement-for without such an adjustment and a Balance appearing due to the State, we concieve it absolutely impracticable to bring Congress to assent an advance on any consideration having heretofore used our Utmost efforts in Vain for that Purpose. We have a report that a fleet of Six French and Six Dutch Ships of the line with a Considerable Body of Land Forces is arrived in the W Indies, but of this there is yet no certainty. We Cannot refrain from informing Your Excellency that altho An Agent (4) is appointed to furnish the delegates with money & we have been long in expectation of remittances of Specific Articles to fix a permanent Credit for us here yet we see little prospect of its being accomplishd soon, and in the meantime it is with Infinite difficulty we have been able to procure the means of Subsistence for ourselves and families which we have been constraind to do by borrowing small [sums?] on our personal Credit-or by Bills drawn at large by the agent in our favor which cannot be discountd at less disadvantage to the State than from  SEPTEMBER 19, 1781  12 1/2 to 20 Per Ct.-this we cannot help thinking a ruinous and disgracefull mode of obtaining money-of which it is our duty to advertize your excellency in hopes that a less ruinous, more honorable and certain expedient may be adopted and that we shall stand excused with our Country for the enhanced expences which such an enormous discount subjects it to.

Being uncertain whether you receive full intelligence of what is transacting elsewhere, and being desirous of rendering you all the service as well as amusement, that my public engagements will admit, I would inform you that last night I received a private account of the junction of the two fleets under the Count de Barras and Count de Grasse, and that the Ruby, of sixty four Guns, and the Rainbow, of forty four, have been captured from the enemy-I hope it is true. We have not yet heard that Admiral Digby is arrived, nor that Sir Henry Clinton has sailed. The latter will I think be puzzled with regard to his future operations. I do not believe Digby can have more than six ships of the line from my perceiving in the British Newspapers, that Sir Robert Harland was offered the command in chief on the American Station and that he refused it, unless furnished with six additional ships of the line and four frigates; as a Junior officer has obtained this command he would scarcely be allowed a greater force.  Lord Cornwallis will, I doubt not, make a vigorous, nay a desperate resistance, not only for the sake of preserving his military character, but with a view to have some chance for relief, at least to spin out the campaign as much as possible in his reduction and thereby prevent any thing more being done. The superiority of the French Fleet at present enables them to be very serviceable to us, and they appear disposed to do all they can.  It appearing probable to Congress that General Clinton may make some attempt on this City, they have adopted the most likely measures to defeat his designs, by calling on the States of Delaware Pennsylvania and New-Jersey for a large body of Militia, and have likewise thought it adviseable to detain General St. Clair and the Recruits of the Pennsylvania line, now in the State, for a few days in the neighbourhood of this City.  It is certain that the Spaniards have blockaded and invested Minorca; I wish it had been Jamaica. By late accounts from France it appears, that the negotiation for a general peace will probably take place the ensuing winter but not before.

 Sr. Philadelphia Septr. 25th 1781 Yesterdays post arrived without any letter from your Excelly. to us. We cannot help observing to your Excelly. that the Operations of the fleet and army are of so important a nature at this Crisis of affairs in Europe that an hourly communication, if it was practicable, would certainly be Eligible; and we therefore lament that no Authentic Intelligence has come from them to Congress for ten days past(1) altho we are informed from every Quarter that there has been an Action of Some Consequence at Sea. A Considerable body (said to be 5000) of land forces has been embarked at New York and were certainly held in readiness for an [immediate movement?] which kept this City and Jersey in a state of alarm in Consequence of which a very large body of Militia have been orderd into the field from both those states and Delaware, who are now actually under Arms, with a Considerable body of Regulars under Majr. Genl. Sinclair. The return of the British fleet to New York (much disabled as we are told) has developed the Mistery of the destination of the Embarkation at New York (which was intended for Chesapeake had their fleet been Successfull, and they are now debarked as is said at Staten Island. Affairs in Europe seem to wear a misterious aspect-Some powers being restraind from entering into the War by the Principles of Neutrality which they have embraced and avowed-others in Consequence of having assumed a Mediatorial Character-and others with a Cautious Policy watching the motions of the two latter and waiting for decisive events among the Belligerent Powers. But every thing seems to point out that all except France, stand aloof from an alliance with us, untill some favorable event on our Side shall turn the Ballance in our favor. This points out to us the necessity of every Exertion on our part in order to gain a decisive advantage and if possible, weaken the pretensions of G Britain by driving her troops out of the Continent. This can only be done by SEPTEMBER 25, 1781  repairing the deranged State of our finances and recruiting our Armies to their full Complement. The Great and Generous Exertions of our ally in our favor certainly call on us for Similar ones on our Side and intitle them to Expect from us that we will put every engine in Motion to obtain those two great ends, therefore it behoves us to act with Energy and call forth all our resources to ensure a good and Speedy Peace.

 Philadelphia Sept. 26. 1781. I send you the Journals of Congress, by Capt. Johnston as compleat as they can at present be procured; there being none left for the Year 1775, and none as yet printed for the present year. This delay of printing has been owing to the same Cause that has delayed the publishing the Votes & Laws of our Legislature. The Papers herewith enclosed, contain all the News we have at present; Every Day we expect to hear from General Washington when 'tis probable we shall be particularly informed of the Situation of Lord Cornwallis. Some officers late from New York say, that he is given up there as lost; and that tis common to hear the British Officers say one to Another \""Well, poor Corne is gone at last.\""  There is no doubt but the british Admiral Graves, received a severe Drubbing from Count De Grasse; he lost at Sea a 74 gun Ship the Terrible and the London; another Ship, of near equal Force, was so disabled, that 'tis doubted whether she will be fit for service this Season. Some other Ships were much damaged. Sr. Harry Clinton intended to have reinforced Cornwallis with the Troops he had embarked, and was wating for the Determination of the naval Superiority in the Chesapeake; and was sanguine in Expectations that the french could not stand before the haughty British. The return of the Fleet altered his opinion; the troops disimbarked with the Tories, who had their Effects on board the Transports in order to return to their respective Homes in Virginia.  This State and New Jersey have been under great Apprehensions, that Sr. Harry would endeavor to make a Stroke at this City, or, fire  SEPTEMBER 26, 1781  some Towns in New Jersey, as tis unlikely he would remain inactive under the present situation of his affairs. Three thousand Militia of this State are now in Arms near this Place for the Defence of the City, and to oppose Sir Harry in any opperations he may design against this State or New Jersey.  The small Representation for sometime past, of Seven States, has occasioned a considerable Delay in Business of Consequence, as nothing could be done without unanimous Consent. Had we left Congress the 10th of September, all Business for sometime would have ceased; which Circumstance may apologize for our staying longer, with those who think the Resolutions by which we were appointed admit of a doubtful Construction as to the Expiration of the Time of our Delegation.  Tis probable our Finances will not admit of our remaining longer in this Place, than two weeks from this Time; on my return I shall continue sometime with the Assembly which I hear is to meet the first of next month.

 Dear Sir. Philadelphia, Sept. 26, 1781. We were favored with your letter by Doctor Young, who leaves town this morning (and will be the bearer hereof) having accomplished his business to his mind, after considerable Delay, which could not well be avoided. I am sorry that it is not in my Power to give you any particular information of the Situation of Cornwallis' Army in Virginia, as we have received no official accounts on the subject.  A letter was received by the President last evening from General Washington dated the 15th at Williamsburg, the day after his arrival, giving no particulars of the military operations in that quarter; except that the English Squadron under Admiral Graves were drove off by Count De Grasse and that he had returned with Count De Barras into the Bay with two captured Frigates, the Iris and Richmond. The Count De Grasse says in his letter that he handled them roughly. By the Accounts from New York it may be depended  SEPTEMBER 26, 1781  upon that the British lost the Terrible, a seventy four & that the London, a ship of equal Tons is rendered unfit for service, and much Damage done to others. I forgot to mention that the Count observes that the Damages he sustained by the Action were not great.  This Action and the joining of the two French Fleets will prevent any superiority on the part of the British for the Relief of Cornwallis, the consequences of which will be, that there is every reason to expect he must sooner or later (altho he should make an obstinate Resistance) surrender to the Arms of America.  It was evidently the intent of the Commander in Chief at New York, first, to beat the French Fleet, and then to reinforce Cornwallis with the Troops he had ready embarked. He was disappointed. the Admiral returned much disabled. The Troops disimbarked, and are now mostly on Staten Island. What measures he will take next is uncertain; some suppose 'tis likely he will endeavor to burn and destroy in New Jersey, and even to make a stroke at this City. There are 3000 Melitia of this State in Arms near the Town for the Defence of New Jersey & this State. Some late advantages have been gained by Parties from Genl. Greene's Army over the Enemy in South Carolina: Civil Government is again established in that State and in the State of Georgia.  For further news I must refer you to the inclosed papers. The Treasury Board with the Chambers of Accounts and the other Boards, for settling the Public Accounts, have now ceased, and the new arrangement according to the Plan of Mr. Morris, the Superintendant of Finance, is adopted. A Controller, a Treasurer and a Register are appointed. A number of Auditors will be appointed as soon as the business will require it, with the necessary clerks. I expect to be at Poughkeepsie within three weeks from this time, where probably I may contine ten or twelve days, in which time I shall be glad to hear from you if find it convenient to write.  With respectful Compliments to Mrs. Taylor, and the young Miss, I am Your very Huml Servt. Ezra L'Hommedieu.  MS not found; reprinted from PMHB, 39 (April 1915): 242-43.

  Sir, Private. Philadelphia. Sept. 26th. 1781 Since I had the honor of writing to you on the 21st instant, I have learned, that on the proposed mediation of the Emperor of Germany and the Empress of Russia to the belligerent powers, the Court of France accepted it,(1) on condition his Allies the United States of America should accede thereto, adding he would immediately advertise them of the measure; the Court of Spain declined it, because a direct negociation had taken place between her & Great Britain, thro' Mr. Cumberland, who was then at Madrid. Soon after this Mr. Cumberland was recalled, and the propostions were renewed. France thereupon desired two questions might be put to Great Britain; 1st. Whether she would agree to the United States' having a Minister Plenipotentiary at the Congress? 2dly. In what manner she would treat with such Minister, whether as the Representative of Sovereign States? These propositions were not only entirely evaded, but Great Britain made it a preliminary, that France should dissolve her connections with the King's subjects in America. Thus matters rested 'till July, when some dark hints were thrown out by Great Britain, that all the States in America could not reasonably expect to be acknowledged Independant, as many of them were subdued by her Arms; and of the seventeen Provinces in the Low Countries only seven were so acknowledged by Spain, which seemed to be the only Precedent of the kind. No further overtures have been made on this head.  Congress had, in the last winter, acceded to the terms of the armed Neutrality planned by the Empress of Russia, and appointed the honorable Francis Dana as their Minister to Petersburgh. Before he set out he waited upon the Count De Vergennes at Paris, and, by SEPTEMBER 26, 1781  his advice, will not appear at the Russian Court in a public Character, without a previous certainty that he will be received as such which is not expected in the present stage of affairs, it behoving Mediators to be quite impartial between the powers at variance: However the way has been prepared, in such a manner, as to ensure a friendly reception of him as a private Gentleman, and for the rest he must trust to the Chapter of Accidents. The Empress was not a little pleased with the Act of Congress agreeing to her maritime code; especially as they had not been invited to it, but did it voluntarily.  We are plainly told, that we cannot have any more forces from France, by Sea or Land, after this campaign, nor are we to rely on any farther pecuniary assistance. The situation of Affairs in Europe will demand their utmost exertions there, and they expect to render as much real service to the common cause in other places, as they could possibly do in America. France, notwithstanding, will continue to pay the interest of our Loan-Office Certificates; and the King has made a free gift of six millions of Livres Tourney, to the United States of the money already supplied them. You may rely on the authenticity of what I have communicated.  In this state of things it behoves us to make the most of the present opportunity. If New York, York-Town in Virginia and Charlestown could be invested at the same time, the very attempt would have a prodigious effect on our enemies and the minds of the Courts in Europe, and in my humble opinion would not only expedite the negociation for peace, but bring it to a favorable issue. Is this practicable? I confess I cannot answer the question; but if Count de Grass could blockade New-York with his fleet, leaving a sufficient number of ships in Chesepeake, and the Militia of Pennsylvania and New Jersey, now called out, were to march to Amboy, Elizabeth-Town &c. and General Heath to close in to the Northward, I think it might be very beneficial. This would effectually prevent General Clinton from detaching by Sea or Land to any place whatsoever; Admiral Digby, or at least many victuallers and merchantmen, might be captured, and if it pleases Providence that you should speedily reduce Cornwallis, you might proceed with your victorious army to New-York and have a prospect of taking it before the Winter sets in. In such a case Charles-Town would fall of course, or be evacuated. At any rate we could bend our whole force against it in the ensuing Winter.  The spirit discovered by the Militia and others seems to invite to enterprize; it is higher than at any time since 1776.  The Robust and Prudent Ships of War have been condemned on a survey last week, as unfit for further service, and the damage sustained by the London, Shrewsbury and some other ships is equal to what was first mentioned.   We wait with a degree of anxiety for certain Intelligence from the Southward, having had none for upwards of a fortnight.  This moment I was honored with your letter of the 15th instant, which shall be read in Congress tomorrow.(2)  I have the honor to be, with the utmost regard, Your Excellency's Most Obedient and devoted humble Servant,  Tho M:Kean ""

Besides the damage done the fleet in the action, we have information that can be depended on that the Robust & Prudent which lay at N York, are in so bad a condition that they are both condemnd, & that they must take out one of their batteries [be]fore they sail for Europe. I believe one or both those Vessels were in the action in the Spring with Monsr. Ds Artouches,(1) which probably put them into their present bad Condition.  On the Return of the fleet to N York Clinton relanded his troops, they are chiefly on Staten Island. The heavy cannon were taken off the grand battery in the night, in order it is suppos'd to strengthen their batteries on the Narrows.

  Sir Philada. Sepr. 28. 1781 I have, at length, found the Letters of Cornwallis to Wimys & Balfour of Octr. 7. 1780 which have been very long mislaid by one of the Delegates of Georgia.(1)  The Cypher for the former comprehends the same course of figures with That of the papers of no date taken in March;(2) but the deceptions are different, nor is the key-number put down, here, as there. I found it by calculation, and discovered that the unalphabetical numbers are not wholly baulks as in the Cases already explained; but that the right-hand figure of them is of the same value as though it stood single.  As to the Cypher for the latter (to Balfour) it is of two Sorts; the first marked B is from some Book, probably an Edition of Entick's Dictionary agreed upon by the Parties and not now in my possession, in which you are to seek 377. 2. 23 [Page. Column. Word].(3) The second is found by calculation to be a different alphabet from those already sent to you. Perhaps the Letter F means the figure to begin the Course, that being the 6th, but I need more Samples to know that certainly. It happens to answer in the present Case.  It will be a Satisfaction to you to see the Object of the march to North Carolina. I find that Fox & Germain are explaining this matter, and the Result is that the Generals here and the ministry there have mutually deceived each other.  I shall be very happy if the Pains I have taken shall enable yr. Secretary to make future speedy discoveries so as to save one of our own or take one of the Enemy's Posts, Parties or Escorts.

Indeed this City could not have been attempted in a more defenceless State, or at a Time which would so essentially have affected the Common Cause.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia Sept. 29th 1781 I wrote you a long letter by Mr. Wilkinson which I hope 'ere this has come safe to hand(1) I therein stated the then aspect of affairs, &  SEPTEMBER 29, 1781  my sanguine expectations thereon. Since which time, I have had no cause to alter my opinion; on the contrary, it has received additional weight, from late intelligence on the other side the water-not public. Thus much for your own ear, or any other in whom you place entire confidence. Our Governor(2) I conceive to be one; and as I know there is the most perfect understanding between you I conclude you communicate your respective intelligence to each other in the most unreserved manner. I must therefore refer you to him, for our public intelligence (that is to say, the intelligence congress has received) in our public letter to him of the 27th instant.(3)  By that you will find what a damn'd vapouring that nation of Don Quixotes still keep up. A letter wrote from hence, by one of their officers, informing them that his Majesty's brave troops, on such a day attacked a pig stye, & put to death 40 pigs, is immediately blazoned forth to the deluded multitude as a most signal victory gained over the rebels, & a few more such must inevitably starve them into submission. Of such a nature, is their famous victory of Guilford, The Cowpens &c. as represented by Cornwallis. In the name of God! let the poor devils enjoy their delusion. But it is not unlikely that Chs. Fox will awaken them from their golden dream 'ere it's long. See the inclosed papers. However, unless their old friend the devil, can help them out at a dead left, I think we shall more effectually open their eyes for them, than even C. Fox will be able to do. If Cornwallis escapes us this bout, I shall begin to have some belief in the power of the devil-for no other God can they worship. But, as I as yet have no faith in him, I must believe he will for once leave them in the lurch. If then this \""southern hero\"" is brought so low, as to submit to a pack of Ragamuffin rebels; I fancy he will lower his tone very much; & perhaps will tell his Masters he is at last convinced these fellows can fight. And as they seem to place such implicit faith in whatever he says; perhaps their eyes may at last be opened too, & they may be convinced, that, \""the Rebels will [not] (4) be left to themselves, to be treated with on such terms & in such manner as they-Gt Britain-shall think proper,\"" & perhaps they may come down a peg, or two; & out of their special Grace and favor consent to the admission of an American Plenepo. into the Congress. And most probably they may in the end, be induced to exclaim, May the Devil fly away with all the Rebels together, for we will have nothing further to do With them. And so bounce out of the Congress, in a high huff Be it so. I don't think our minister will not try to coax them back. I think I hear you say, it is high time to quit all this rodomontade, & come to something substantial, for you have something else to do, than spend your time in reading what don't give you some useful information. Faith & troth!-Sancho like-if you don't let me tell my story in my own way I shall never have done. If you had had a little patience, I was going to draw these conclu-  sions from the premises. That all things look well at 3000 miles distance-that our friends are staunch-that they rather increase than diminish, some under the rose, some more openly, others avowedly so. In short, that a variety of circumstances concur to induce in me a belief, that the haughty, & imperious Britons will soon be brought to think like reasonable beings.  We wait here in anxious expectation of what is, or shall be done by you respecting the execution of Collo. Hayne.(5) All eyes are on you, & look up to you for just retaliation not only those who were his friends & Countrymen but I may say every Whig in America.  Intelligence from Virginia, I presume you receive regularly, therefore it would be useless to be repeated by me. Also what are contained in the newspapers. I do not send them to you, as the Delegates send them regularly to the Governor, which I suppose is the same thing.  The inclosed speech of Chs. Fox, I am sure will afford you much entertainment. I think there is a vein of satire, spirit, & humour, that runs through the whole of it, which I scarcely ever met with. If he could get 99 votes on this motion, he stands a good chance for a majority before the rising of the next parliament.  The extract from Heath, gives a striking picture of N.York, & shows that the invincible British navy has got a most damnable drubbing, however Sr. Harry's Mercury may attempt to disguise it. This fellow Rivington has of late lyed so intolerable, that the tories of Philadelphia, will now hardly believe what he says.  All health, happiness, & prosperity attend you.

  Dear sir, Philadelphia Octr.1.178(1). Although I am well convinced your time must be occupied by very important objects; Yet I presume you will not regret the few moments employed in the perusal of the following interesting advices lately received through the most authentic channel.  \""After the retreat of Mr. Cumberland from the court of Madrid, that court, finding itself relieved from the embarassments created by that gentleman's residence there, immediately accepted the proffered Mediation of the two Imperial courts, and in conjunction with the Court of Versailles declared, that although they were perfectly desirous of proceeding on the negotiations for restoring peace among the belligerent powers, Yet as a preliminary to the commencement of this important business; they should peremptorily insist on the admission of an American Plenepotentiary to a seat in the Congress proposed to be held. The two Mediators represented this demand to the Court of London, to which a futile, & evasive answer was returned. The earnestness of the Mediators to bring forward a business which they had so much at heart, & in which all Europe appeared so deeply interested, made a second representation on this head. To which, the following answer, after much delay, was given. That the demand on the parts of France & Spain, were totally inadmissible on the part of the Court of London, that her OCTOBER 1, 1781  rebellious subjects must be left to herself to be dealt with in such manner as she should think proper, & that as soon as France thought fit to dissolve the connexion she had formed with her revolted subjects, she was both ready, & willing to order her Ministers to open the negotiations. That this insolent reply had been treated with a becoming resentment by the Court of France. That the way to negotiation was still kept open, 'tho there was no probability of any thing effectual being done, untill the end of the campaign, which would eventually govern G. Britain in the part she is then to act.  \""It is recommended to us in the most pointed terms to make every effort in our power towards a vigorous campaign in the ensuing year, that we might be fully prepared to prosecute the war with becoming ardour, if it should be found necessary. That from the obstinacy of G. B. this will most likely be the case, unless she should receive some very severe blow in the course of the present campaign. That it is expected the very liberal and substantial aid afforded us this year, will place our finances on such a footing as will enable us to arrange our affairs in such manner as to give a sufficient degree of vigour & decision to the future operations of the war. That France is determined to fulfill her engagements to us in their utmost extent, that her late conduct has sufficiently evidenced her affection for us, by even far exceeding, what had been stipulated on her part. That she hopes her allies will feel a like disposition on their part, & that it will be manifested by suitable exertions for bringing to a speedy & successful determination the present war. [Here follow some matters, which I do not think would be prudent to trust to a plain letter] Through another channel, it is said G. B. industriously propagates by her emissaries at the several courts of Europe, that it is her fixed determination, never to give up an inch of America, whilst she can command a guinea to carry on the war.\""  There appears a degree of arrogance, petulence, and Gasconade through the whole conduct of this corrupt, and infatuated nation, that is truely ridiculous. Beyond all doubt, the stake she is contending for, is of the last consequence to her. Therefore, she will leave nothing unessayed to carry her point. True, but when the seventh year of war, & every other expedient, has only served to exhibit a far greater degree of imbecility, than either of the preceeding ones, it is presumable, their dear bought experience, would produce more moderation, and plyability.  It appears most likely the fleet will not remain on our coast after the operations in Cheasepeak are over. This is a very unlucky circumstance; for I am clearly of opinion, that if Chs. Town could be taken this winter it would conclude the war. Many corroborating circumstances serve to give weight to this opinion. However, as this is not likely to be effected, a political manuvre may be made on this   object, that may be productive of important consequences. If your Excelly should succeed against Cornwallis-which you have all good mens most hearty prayers for-& your victorious army should then move towards Chs. town, it would make a very deep impression on a British parliament, for, so severe a blow, as the loss of Cornwallis's army must be to them, they will scarcely consider the probability, or improbability of its success. But every effect capable of being produced from an army just tryumphant where little danger was apprehended & consequently flushed with it's success, then bending it's course against another most important object, must add fresh cause for apprehension to minds already appaled, & induce in them a serious consideration of the probable consequences of this new danger, which may create a moderation, they have hitherto been averse to, & may end in undissembled overtures for peace. This is the political view, in which such a manuvre strikes my mind, & I draw my conclusions from what appears lately to have been the disposition, of a very respectable number in the British parliament on a motion of Chs. Fox's, which when brought to a vote, received an accession of at least thirty votes, to what similar motions had ever produced. If then the consequences of the battle of Guilford could cause such a secession from deep rooted venality, what effect must such substantial, & probable misfortunes, as I have above alluded to, be productive of? I think the chance is much in my favor, when I say, a very desirable one, I mean, a serious disposition for peace.  Least you should not, through any other channel obtain it, I inclose you the paper with Mr. Fox's speech, & motion. It is replete with the keenest satire, wit, & humour, & I am sure will afford you a half hour's amusement.  I beg your Excellencys pardon for having taken up so much of your time, but the subject was interesting; which has led me into a prolixity, I did not intend, at my first setting out.  I should not have trusted so much to paper as I have done, were it not for the favourable opportunity that offers by Dr. Oliphant, whom I beg leave to recommend to your Excys notice.(1)  May the Supreme Being protect your valuable life, through the dangers you are about to encounter. And may his Guardian Angel attend to crown you with Laurel. And believe me to be, My Dear sir, with the most perfect Esteem & regard, Yr. most Obedt. Servt.  Jno. Mathews ""

  Dear Sir, Philada. Octor. 2d. 1781. We have reports various ways of an engagement near Charles Town, but they are so uncertain and Contradictory that we can collect nothing from them worth telling. Genll. Washington was to begin his operations soon after the 23d ulto when he last wrote. No late News from Europe.  The Enemy we hear remain peacible on the Island.l I cannot OCTOBER 2, 1781  believe they intend a visit to this Town and it appears also improbable that a Decent into Jersey is all they have in Contemplation, from the boats with them on Carriages; that they will come among us to forrage is a very probable Conjecture, but I think their present movement is principally intended to draw our Army from the Southward or Northward to Oppose them, either to relieve Cornwallis or Attack West Point.  Our friend Boudinot just moved to disband the Militia of Pennsylva. & Delaware in case the Executive of those States think the measure Adviseable, but this Motion was rejected.(2) I am unable to judge the real Occasion of this motion, the reason he offered, was to save expense, but it may rather be Supposed as intended to keep the Enemy from coming this way with intentions to frighten or Catch the Militia as you know they would disdain to go where there were no forces to Oppose them and where there was no Army to capture.  We are now represented by three members.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia 2d October 1781. Uncertain whether we shall meet I reluctantly commit to paper my Sentiments on the Subject of your favour of the 23d of last month.(1) You will not thank me if I shoud not express myself with Candour. The Share I have had in your Appointment and my Esteem for you strongly incline me to wish that every thing preparatory to the Assumption of your Office coud have been adjusted to your Satisfaction. The embarrassed Situation of our Finances however woud at this Time frustrate any Attempt to enlarge your Salary: the more especially as it is hard to convince several Members that it will be a Trust of Toil and difficulty. Hence notwithstanding all the pains which were taken to explain it's various and most  OCTOBER 2, 1781  important Duties a distinction was made in the Salaries for the great executive Departments. You will observe that the discrimination could not be personal, for the Salaries were all fixed before any nomination of Candidates.(2) As the Act is expressed your Stipend ought in my opinion to be considered merely as a provision for your own immediate Services. Office Expences, on a reasonable Construction, will include your necessary assistants and every incidental Charge. To enumerate and make a Requisition for them on proper grounds appears to me to be now impracticable.(3) Experience alone will give a Just foundation. The Financier who is to provide for the civil List will unquestionably contribute to settle those matters properly. I have already chatted with him on the Subject. As the usefulness of the office and the essential Advantages which I expect from your abilities unfold themselves, the Justice of enlarging your Salary will become obvious and the disagreeable Task of Sollicitation thro' those who are known to be your Friends unnecessary. May I add that in the present Temper of Congress, pressed as they are with wants and difficulties, you will exalt your Character by the Moderation of your Appointments and your own personal Activity.  You say we ought not to return untill the Expiration of our Authority. Had you backed your Advice with a Remittance for our Support we woud chearfully have acquiesced. At present a Stern monitor, our exhausted purse-dictates to us the necessity of retiring. I find, my dear Sir, an opinion prevails-and sorry I am to see that even you subscribe to it-that the office I possess is a full Compensation for the Loss of all domestic Happiness-to say nothing of my long and faithful Services for these carry with them their own reward. You, Sir, who are a Husband and a Parent ought to feel for me. The Legislature will-they cannot but have sufficient Candour to be reconciled to the Representation which I shall lay before them. It will be time enough for me to speak a plain language when it can be done without presumption.

Our Vessels from the Head of Elk, are all Arrived, and were debarkg the Troops and stores, except a few, which were hourly Expected, their not having Arrived, is Accounted for from the Dullness of their Sailing.

  Dear Doctr Philadelphia Octo 2d 1781 I am obliged to you for your favour of the 25th ult. which Came to hand yesterday. Dr. Wiesenthals opinion of your Case, gives me real pleasure, and I hope you will Shortly find yourself much better. Every Account from N York Confirms the advices we had of the Enemys fleet having Suffered much in the late Engagement, With Count De Grasse-the Counts own Acct of the matter is very Modest. He Acquaints the Minister, that the British fleet having appeared off the Capes. He went out, engaged their Van, which was treated very roughly, drove off the fleet, And returned Again into Chesapeak, that he took two frigates in the Bay, which had been Sent in, to Cut the Boyes from His Cables. He says nothing about any Damage he had received, and it is therefore Concluded he received none-this is a most Glorious and fortunate Event as it will Effectually prevent any succors being given to Cornwallis.  On the 23d ult. General Washington returned to Williamsburgh from a Visit to Admiral De Grasse, on board His Ship the Ville de paris at Cape Henry-that Admiral He says is disposed in the best manner to give us all the assistance in his power, and perfectly to Cooperate with him in our present Attempt Against Lord Cornwallis. And the general Hopes in a few days to be before the Enemys Works at York and Glocester. Our Vessels from the head of Elk are all Arrived And Were on the 23d debarking the Troops and stores, except a few which were hourly expected. Their not being Arrived is Accounted for from the Dullness of their sailing. I have inclosed you the papers.  I should be very glad to purchase a part of Mr D. Land, that part of Albino Choice and Spring Garden laid off next to Benedict Stoners. I Should prefer, an acct of the great quantity of Wood on it and the Spring, but I would not Chuse to involve my Self in Difficulties and lay myself under Obligations the Security required is unreasonable, and I cant bring my Self to ask anyone to Mortgage and Subject their Estates to immediated Seizure on my Account, besides I apprehend it will Sell very high far beyond its real Value. The long Credit will tempt many to risque a purchase. If there was a probability of its Selling reasonable, and Secureity Could readily be found I Should be glad to become a purchaser it would be more Convenient than my own land, which I would Sell.  My Compliments to Governor Johnston and Mr. Potts, would have Wrote to them both but have nothing to Communicate more than is in this Letter. Please to tell the Latter that His Carriage will be Compleatly finished this Week. And I think it a very Genteel one. The man wishes it may be immediately Sent for, to make room as he  OCTOBER 2, 1781  Says in his Shop, but the want of the money perhaps is the true reason.

  Dear Sir Philada. Ocr. 2d. 1781 Yours of 24th ulto.(1) came safe by yesterdays post. In addition to the paper of this day I enclose you two of the preceding week in one of which you will find a very entertaining & interesting speech by Mr Fox, and in the other a handsome forensic discussion of a case important in itself and which has some relation to the State of Virginia.(2)  Our intelligence from N. Y. through several channels confirms the sufferings of the B. fleet from their rash visit to the Capes of Chesapeak. The troops which were kept in Transports to await that event have since the return of the fleet been put on shore on Staten Island. This circumstance has been construed into a preliminary to an expedition to this City, which had revived, till within a few days the preparations for a Militia opposition, but is better explained by the raging of a malignant fever in the City of N Y. Digby we hear is now certainly arrived but with three ships of the line only. It is given out that three more with a large number of Transports came with him and that they only lay back till it was known whether they could proceed to N. Y. with safety. This is not improbably suspected to be a trick to palliate the disappointment and to buoy up the sinking hopes of their adherents, the most staunch of whom give up Lord Cornwallis as irretrievably lost.  We have received some communications from Europe relative to the general State of its affairs. They all center in three important points; the first is the obstinacy of G. B, the second the fidelity of our Ally, and the third the absolute necessity of vigorous & systematic preparations for war on our part in order to ensure a speedy as well as favorable peace.(3) The Wisdom of the Legislature of Virginia OCTOBER 2, 1781  will I flatter myself, not only prevent an illusion from the present brilliant prospects, but take advantage of the military ardor and sanguine hopes of the people to recruit their line for the war. The introduction of specie will also I hope be made subservient to some salutary operations on their finances. Another great object which in my opinion claims an immediate attention from them, is some liberal provision for extending the benefits of Government to the distant parts of the State.(4) I am not able to see why this cannot be done, so as fully to satisfy the exigences of the people and at the same time preserve the idea of Unity in the State. Any plan which divides in any manner the Sovereignty may be dangerous & precipitate an evil which ought & may at least be long procrastinated. The Administration of Justice which is the capital branch may certainly be diffused sufficiently and kept in due subordination in every part to one supreme tribunal. Separate boards for auditing accounts may also be admitted with safety & propriety. The same as to a separate depository for the taxes &c, and as to a land office. The military powers of the Executive, may well be entrusted to Militia officers of Rank, as far as the Defence of the Country & the Custody of Military Stores make it necessary. A complete organization of the Militia in which [a] Genl Officer would be created would greatly facilitate this part of the plan. Such an one with a Council of Field Officers, might exercise without encroaching on the Constitutional powers of the Supreme Executive, all the powers over the Militia which any emergency could demand.  I am Dr. Sir Yrs. Sincerely, J. Madison Jr.(5)  ""

  Sir Philadelphia Octr 2d. 1781 Your Excellency will receive by the Post an Act of Congress for making good the pay of the Genl Officers, (1) which I believe our State has antissipated, but no general Rule has yet been adopted for making good the pay of the Civil and military Staff; which your Excellency, by a Letter some time ago, requested might be attended to. Several reports have been made on the subject which have been rejected, and the matter lies now with a Commee.(2)  The Resolves of the Genl Assembly and the Letter of their Commee. relative to drawing in the old money &c were referred to the Superintendant of finance. I have frequently applyd. to him to report some effectual method for calling in the old money, which yet remains outstanding, and for doing Justice to those States, who have done their duty.(3) He says that he shall insist on the plan of the 18th of March for calling in the old money at 40 for one; and when the States have drawn in their nominal Quotas; that they must be credited according to the Value of the money at the time of payment.  His professed & I believe his real plan, is, that Justice shall be done betwixt the several States, their Accounts Setled, and that no one shall suffer by a prompt & ready complyance with the requisitions of Congress.  Mr. Morris informs me that about four millions old Dollars remain due on former taxes, & a greater or less sum from other States. I am apprehensive that a part or the whole of that money may lie in our treasury in the dead emissions, as they were called. If this is the case we may perhaps suffer by neglecting to pay it in when it was of value; however I think that a return ought to be made of it, if any remains in the treasury.  A gentleman has lately arrived here from the Havannah who conversed with Genl Galvez before he came away & says that the General has been informed that the Capitulation at Pensacola was disapproved of by the U. States, which gave him much uneasness; that the Genl informd him that it was fully understood at the time of OCTOBER 2, 1781  Portrait of  George Partridge  the Capitulation, that the troops of that Garrison should not Bear Arms against the U. States; and that he should consider their taking up arms here, as a Breach of that Capitulation, for the fulfilment of which he had a sufficient number of Hostages.  I congratulate your Excellency on the pleasing prospect we have of the reduction of Britain's hero Cornwallis and his veteran host. Genl Washington has doubtless before now commenced his operations against him & I trust will soon convince our Enemy of the vanity of fighting any longer against the cause of Justice & the Rights of mankind.

  Sir, Philadelphia 2d Octr. 1781. Your Excellency is well acquainted with the natural and political Situation of the Island of Bermuda. For many Reasons I have tho't a Conquest of that Island necessary. Its Inhabitants are generally friendly to the united States, and are loudly dependent on them for Subsistence. It was intended to be annexed to them when the Treaty of Alliance was formed with France. Should it be ultimately annexed, will form an excellent Barrier against naval Operations in a future War. But should the British strenuously insist upon retaining some Possessions, in a general Pacification, in Consequence of then holding Posts, such as New York &c., it may be necesary to silence their Claim by Composition. In that Case the Island might be ceded. Our Commerce is greatly annoyed by the Privateers which rendesvous there; A Conquest might relieve us from that Inconvenience & convert it into a Place of Arms for our own Vessells. As we have politically debarred the Inhabitants from all Correspondence or Commerce, their Necessities will oblige them to cruise for our Provision Vessells: Their Island is every way calculated to annoy us in that Respect. I have made myself fully acquainted with the Strength, Defences, & Resources of the Place: I am confident that five hundred Men, aided by three or four Frigates, would be fully sufficient to take the Island; & that Number would be sufficient to garrison it, could they have six Weeks to fortify themselves, previous to an Attempt to dislodge them. They should have six Months Provision, Artillery, Amunition, & some spare Arms, as two Battalions might be raised from the white and black Inhabitants. To give them a Time OCTOBER 2, 1781  for fortifying the Place, the Expedition should not begin 'till after the Fleets have gone to the West Indies. It is not probable any serious Attack could then be made upon them 'till next Fall. I have not mentioned this matter to Congress: It should be on the Point of Execution previous to such an Intimation, if possible. I am very anxious to know your Excellency's Opinion upon the Subject previous to any Arrangements respecting it.(1) If you should incline to the Measure, whether it will be best to detach a Continental Battalion, or raise other Troops for the Purpose? Whether it will be best to furnish the Stores &c. from the public, or by individual Adventurers? And if French Frigates can be employed in the Cooperation? The Gentleman who bears this(2) is perfectly acquainted with the Island. By the best Intelligence we have been able to obtain, the British lost two seventy fours, the Vengeance and Terrible, in Consequence of the late Ingagement with Count de Gras[se], Had the Princessa, a seventy, totally disabled, & four other Line of Battle Ships, very much injured. Sir Henry Clinton has made some Demonstrations towards an Attack in New Jersey or Pennsylvania; Militia Camps have been formed: Such Precautions are at least excusable, perhaps necessary.  We have attempted to elect a Secretary at War-Genls. Greene, Lincoln & Knox are in Nomination; all the Votes for one or other of those Gentlemen. We effected nothing.(3) Tis said Genl. Greene cannot be taken from the Army, considering the southern Situation: I wish your Excellency would say who can be appointed with the greatest Propriety.

' He had detached Genl Marian & Coll Lee on some particular business, when he was attacked by the Enemy. The attempt was first made on the Militia, who recd them with Spirit, Coll Washington was sent into the Enemies rear.

Coll Washington is wounded thro the side, and several valuable Officers killed. Genl Marian & Coll Lee with their fresh Troops, came up just at the Conclusion and immediately went in Pursuit of the Enemy.

I recd. in answer to which I can inform you that many reasons will prevent my Acceptance of the Office you mention, I am Certain I cannot Accept without giving offence. Weighty reasons induce me to decline a seat in the Legislature, in this I am clearly determined should I be put in Nomination at the Ensuing Electing, justice to the County will Oblige you to make this my resolution known to prevent the expense of a New Election. You know I cannot take a seat in the Legislature while I hold one in Congress, and this I shall avail my self of by Continuing my present Standing untill the end of my Delegation, which will Necessarily Vacate my Election should I be chosen, as I must resign here at the meeting of the Houses in order to entitle me to a seat, by omitting this my Election would be Vacated of Course & a new Writ be ordered-from this my determination you will take measures at the ensuing Election for the choice of such as can & will serve; My present situation will excuse me without the Necessity of saying I will not.(1) I question whether you can offer reasons equal with mine for declining, and therefore need not wait for my example to stimulate you to do what you hold forth as a duty for me to comply with- very bad Divinity to call upon me for Example, I must confess were I to serve I should be happy in your assistance.  As to your late discovery of the Spirit of Confederation, I can scarcely say any thing about, without incurring Censure as being Interested; I must therefore remind you that it is well known Attendance in Congress hath long been a painful service to me, and I feel a strong desire to be free from it. My self therefore out the question, I cannot but reflect upon our situation should you Act as you propose unless I am mistaken in some facts; If I am rightly informed Dr. Witherspoon, Mr. Houston, Dr. Elmer & myself have served three Years, & that Dr. Scudder, Mr. Boudinot, Dr. Henderson & Colo. Freilinghuysen will decline if Chosen, if this is the Case shall We have New Members that know any thing of the Business of Congress, while Many if not all of the Other states whose Constitutions Admit of it send some of their old members without regard to the time they have served, judging that the Confedration cannot  OCTOBER 3, 1781  and Ought not to have any Operation before its final ratification; indeed, it never was made a Rule to govern Congress before that period. The Limitation is in general useful but then it ought to be a rule equally regarded by all or none, or those who do not confine themselves by it will have a manifest Advantage over the Others who are not prepared to Act agreable to the Spirit of it. The present situation of our publick affairs requires the assistance of such as have a thorough knowledge in the business before Congress. The only proper System for the Choice of members, in my opinion, is to Elect only three Members Annually two of which Acquainted with the business, one of the old ones to go out at every Choice to make room for a New one, by this measure there will always be two that had served before. The three Chosen should be such as agree to Attend except prevented by sickness-the Choice of five members will only incapaci[t]ate a greater Number after three years service without giving better Attendance.  We have Accounts, tho not official, but such as seem not to Admit of a doubt that a severe battle was fought near Charles Town on the 8th Ulto, in which we had upwards of two hundred killed and Wounded, and the Enemy lost in killed, wounded & taken between Six and Nine hundred, and when the Accounts came away our forces were in pursuit of the Enemy who were on a precipitate retreat; Colo. Lee & Marian with their Corps were not in the Action, but had got near the Enemy in their retreat & it was expected would soon come up with them with their fresh troops-the Enemy had no horse-during the Action Our horse was intirely surrounded, Colo. Washington wounded but not Mortally, taken prisoner & after four hours with the Enemy retaken, All his officers except one Lieut. were either killed or Wounded; All Accounts agree that the Action was very bloody, and that we Obtained a compleat Victory-the Acct. is brought by a Delegate from North Carolina who saw Letters from officers in the Action.

Should that be the Case, you can be recalled, from a fatiguing tho' glorious Service, to the Head of the War Department.(1) This Department waits for you, but the Belligerent Mars interposes a Frown!

We have recd an Acct this Morning, of the taking of Fort Slongo on Long Island without the Loss of a Man.(1) This was a refugee Post, wherein we took & destroyd three pieces of Cannon, a quantity of Cloathing & a Parcill of English Goods, Ammunition &ca. We got 18 Prisoners & 3 officers. Mr. Franklin has been with me and says he is advised by a number of his Friends, to make immediate Sale, if he can get 10/-this I have assented to, as he says it is most likely to fall, and he is sure it will not rise. I wrote you fully abt the Wood which I doubt not will answer.(2) I have no objection to his using the Oxen, tho' the Price is high without any such advantage.

It was sent by Elisha, who says it was given to him after it had been opened at Morris Town. Mr Meade has sent all your Letters. The Vessel in which Mr Searle was to return, is arrived safe at Casco Bay, so that I suppose you will soon see him.

I wish you an happy Meeting with him. I shall be rejoyced to find that the Voyage has been beneficial to his Constitution.

One System or another will be pursued; One Party or another will prevail, much will depend on the Events of the War.

There has been a most severe Engagement on the 8th of Sepr. in 5th. Carolina.(3) I think I shall be able to send a printed account to  OCTOBER 9, 1781  Boston by the Bearer of this. It has been spoken of, here for some days; and this Evening Gen. Greens Thanks to his army are brought to Philada. by a Gentleman of good Character.

  Dear Sir Philadelphia Octr. 9. 1781. I was much distressed on the receipt of your late favor by Mrs Randolph, to find your irrevocable purpose of sequestering yourself from public life. (1) If you can justify this resolution to yourself, I am confident, that you cannot to the world. There remains now no alternative, but either to consign southern interests wholly, to the management of Our present ministers, or to interdict them from the exercise of all discretionary power.  My distance from Colle prevents me from attending to George Hay so minutely, as my knowledge of his genius and application inclines me to do. I must request you, As a friend to rising abilities, to give him a hint of such books, as my little stock will afford, and are suited to his progress. I am certain, that an apology for consigning this trouble to you, is unnecessary.  Mr. Adams has been harrassing the pensionary of Holland with  OCTOBER 9,1781  overtures of a treaty of commerce. He seems to have committed the dignity of America by his importunities, and being so often repudiated. This he has done against the opinion and advice of Count de Vergennes. Our country does not rest, I hope, upon the prospect of a loan from Holland, or of any new pecuniary aid from France. France has embarrassed herself by her advances for America, and forewarned us to rely on ourselves alone for fresh supplies of Money. I must intreat you to add one other object to your journey to the assembly-enforce the necessity of a state of our accounts against the continent being forwarded to us, and of establishing sufficient funds to enable congress to carry on the war with effect.  Capt. Gillon, who took on board of his ship in France about £10,000 Ster. worth of clothing and was supposed to be lost, is arrived at Falmouth in Casco bay.

  Sir Philadelphia October 9. 1781. When your excellency assented to a weekly correspondence with us, we flattered ourselves with the prospect of being able to gratify those inquirers after southern intelligence, to whom our situation would incline us to be communicative. We undergo a sensible mortification in being left dependent on uncertain reports for information of General Washington's progress. This mortification proceeds not from a wish to soothe our private curiosity, but from a conviction, that the objects of our mission will be better answered, and injurious reports counteracted with effect, by the possession of authentic accounts. We therefore intreat your excellency to give us a weekly intimation of military affairs in Virginia, altho' they should remain as they were at the date of the next preceding letter; assuring you, that we shall continue to be punctual on our part.(1)  The decided measures, which Holland has taken against Great Britain, drew from Mr. Adam's the inclosed memorial. There does not seem, however, any ground to believe, that his success will be immediate.(2)  It is impossible to expect, that France, engaged as she is in expence, should maintain the American war out of her own treasury. Her advances for America have been generous, but not sufficient to OCTOBER 9, 1781  overcome the necessity of the exertions of the different states. Every state has the same plea with Virginia of being a creditor of the united states. Our hope therefore is, that, whilst Virginia labours to furnish new supplies, she will not forget the importance of forwarding to us as accurate an account, as possible, of her disbursements for the union.(3)  The report of a committee of congress, appointed to consider the cessions of western territory, made by Virginia, New-York and Connecticut, has been brought into discussion at our instance.(4) It declared in general terms the inadmissibility of those cessions upon the conditions specified, fixed a day for ascertaining the boundaries, beyond which congress would not guarantee, and concluded with a recommendation to lay out separate states in the ceded lands. After some debate it was recommitted. The advocates for recommitment acted upon different motives; some intending thereby to open a door for a full and minute question of the territorial rights of those three states; whilst others, among whom we were, proposed that the subject should be handled merely upon the basis of several resolutions of congress, passed with the express view of stifling all inquiries of right.(5) We have attended the committee for a great part of the three last days, which have been occupied by New York in the development of her title. Her delegates will probably finish their pretensions to day. Connecticut will be concise. We shall deliver to the committee written reasons for declining to enter into discussions of right.(6) Your excellency need not apprehend, that we shall weaken our title by the discovery of any ill-founded distrusts, or expose our candor to suspicion. We forewarned the Delegates of New York and Connecticut of our scruples as to our authority to submit to an investigation of the right, and the committee were reminded, that their present procedure violated the assurances of congress, contained in the resolutions abovementioned. By the next post we shall transmit a farther history of this transaction together with a copy of our reasons.(7)  We have the honor to be, Sir, your excellency's mo. ob. servts. James Madison Junr.

10505,dg018122,1781,Virginia Delegates Protest,"""Virginia Delegates' Protest
  [October 10, 1781](1) That no misconstruction unfavorable to the territorial rights of the State of Virginia may be put on the refusal of its Delegates to exhibit evidence in support of them before the Committee to whom the territorial Cessions of Virginia, New York and Connecticut were referred according to the request of that Committee and the example of the Delegates from New York and Connecticut, the considerations on which that refusal was grounded, and of which the committee were verbally apprized before any progress was made in the present enquiry, are now stated to them in writing.  First. The Acts of Congress (2) in compliance with which the abovementioned Cessions were made are founded on the supposed inexpediency of discussing the questions of right, and recommends to the several States having territorial claims in the Western Country, a liberal surrender of a portion of those claims for the benefit of the  OCTOBER 10, 1781  United States as the most advisable means of removing the embarrassments which such questions created. To make these acts of surrender then, the basis of a discussion of territorial rights is a direct contravention of the Acts of Congress, and tends to diminish the weight and efficacy of future recommendations from them to their Constituents.  Secondly. If the present discussion has been opened upon an opinion that Congress can assume for the use of the United States any portion of territory claimed by an individual State and supposed by them not to fall within its limits, we are now to learn the page of the Confederation in which this power is delegated; if upon an opinion that Congress may exercise jurisdiction in territorial controversies between individual States, we refer the Committee to the Article of the Confederation which vests an exclusive jurisdiction in such cases in another tribunal.(3)  Thirdly. The Cases now before the Committee may eventually be brought before that constitutional tribunal. Ought not its decrees to be free from the bias & suspicion to which they may be exposed by the most indirect prejudication on the subject of right by so high an Authority as Congress, or even a Committee of Congress?  Fourthly. Although it should be confessed that the cognizance of territorial rights belongs to Congress or a Committee of Congress (against which position we strenuously protest) yet the very form of conducting this business, if scanned by the ordinary rules of Justice, is manifestly and essentially defective. Without any previous notice to the parties of an intention to discuss questions of right and receive evidence relating to them, nay, after expressly holding forth to them an intention to exclude all such questions, they are now called upon to exhibit the evidence which supports their respective claims, by which means prepossessions in favor of one party may be created by arguments and representations which another party is unprepared to controvert.  Fifthly. Nor can the conditions or reservations annexed to some of the Cessions (4) render a discussion of territorial rights necessary to determine the Authority of Congress to accept them. For even if these reservations should interfere with the claims of any other State, what injury can arise, since the doors of the Constitutional tribunal will not be barred  to them and it may at the same time be declared by Congress that such acceptance shall in no wise affect them.

If you require me to be more particular I can be so. But there is such a littleness in this business, that I had almost rather lose the whole of petty charges.  When I charge board so often, it is to be understood of an advance to my landlady.

  Sir, (private) Philadelphi, October 12th. 1781.  I had the honor of writing last to your Excellency on the 26th September. (1)  Since that time we have had letters from Mr Adams at Paris on the 15th of July, and from Amsterdam on the 3d of August; they confirm what I wrote you last. OCTOBER 12, 1781  On Monday the rear of the fleet that sailed from England with Admiral Digby arrived at Sandy-Hook; it consists of 34 Transports under convoy of a ship of 40 Guns & three frigates. No more, it is said, are expected. This information I received late last night from Mr David Foreman at Freehold.  Admiral Greaves will, it is believed, make a second attempt to relieve Lord Cornwallis, he is making every preparation for that purpose, and it is thought will proceed for the Chesapeake immediately. It may be well to apprize Count de Grasse of this without delay.  Sir Henry Clinton sent off three boats with despatches for Lord Cornwallis; one, named the Andre, carrying a brass six pounder in her bow, eight blunderbusses, and twenty men armed with muskets sailed on the 26th September last; the second sailed on the 28th and the third on the 1st instant: we have taken the two last, and by means of a little address and a promise of pardon to a Tory, who was intrusted with one sett of the dispatches, I found it was hid on the beach where he was taken; I have procured three Gentlemen of ingenuity and fidelity to proceed to little Egg harbour with the fellow, in quest of it. The beach is so extensive, and so many places like each other, that it is not yet found, tho' the man is believed to be perfectly sincere in his wishes to recover it. The Gentlemen went from this on Sunday, and I expect their return to morrow; you shall know the result as soon as they arrive. In the mean time the boat which first sailed should be looked for by the Fleet; I have written to the Presidents of Delaware and the Eastern Shore of Maryland to watch for her.  We shall be obliged to compleat Colo. Armand's Legion, and I despair of doing it with Americans, if all the Field Officers are French Gentlemen. There is now a vacancy by the resignation of the Major, and if the Colonel would approve of Captain Allen McLean who is now on half pay, to be his Major, it would save the half pay, oblige a very deserving Officer, be a means of Speedily filling his corps, and greatly tend to the public benefit. I should be happy if you and the Colonel were of this opinion.(2)  Captain Gilland [Gillon] is said to be arrived in the Frigate Charles-Town in Casco Bay. He has cloathing &c. for Congress to the amount of ten thousand pounds sterling & upwards, and I believe a Million & an half of livres. It is a fortunate arrival & I sincerely congratulate you upon it; for I now flatter myself your army will be well cloathed & paid in future.  OCTOBER 13, 1781  The Express delivered your favor of the first instant only last night; it shall be laid before Congress this morning.(3)  I have the honor to be, with the greatest esteem, Sir, Your Excellency's Most obedient Servant, Tho M:Kean  ""

My intelligence was true; the inclosed copies of two original letters from Sir Henry Clinton to Lord Cornwallis, which I have in cyphers, and which have been faithfully decyphered by Mr Lovell (whose key I had the honor to forward to you about a fortnight ago) more than prove the fact. (1)  I shall make no comment on the letters of Sir Henry, lest I should wade beyond my depth, but I rest assured you will excuse what I think it a duty to add. From comparing all my secret informations together, I firmly believe the British Admiral has now twenty nine ships of the line, and a very respectable number of Frigates; which, with ten fire-Ships, have probably sailed yesterday for the Chesa- OCTOBER 14, 1781  peake, having on board between five & six thousand Land forces. As to the three additional ships, they are supposed to have come from the west Indies, and are said to have arrived the beginning of last week. Sir Henry expected to be ready to sail on the 5th instant, I am greatly deceived if he sailed before Friday, for I have had faithful Friends to myself, as well as to the cause, who left the Sea-coast yesterday, some distance, 'tis true, from the Hook to the Southward, who know nothing of it; and if he had sailed before Friday, I believe they would have known it-These are the Gentlemen who brought me Sir Henry's dispatches. Among the letters (all being carefully inclosed in lead) I have found some, that will enable me to prevent some men of Sussex County in the State I have the honor to represent, from doing us much mischief, and perhaps they may enable me to make further discoveries: they have little relation to your immediate concerns, and therefore I shall not trouble you with the contents, except that intelligence is intended to be conveyed to & from Lord Cornwallis by way of the Tanjier Islands in the Chesapeake near the Eastern shore. I never heard of them before, and not having time to satisfy myself where they lie, must refer it to your enquiry.  It is far from my thoughts to intermeddle in the operations of the campaign, but I know you will pardon me for suggesting to Major General Heath, that after Sir Henry Clinton sails, it is my opinion there will not be above Four thousand land forces left in New-York and it's environs, of whom there cannot be above a thousand regulars, and that therefore it may be adviseable for him to be in readiness to attack it, if he should be so directed by you. Should you, Sir, think this practicable, or adviseable, there will, in less than a fortnight after I shall have information of it, be five thousand militia to co-operate with him.  The use that may be made of the three large smoaks, if you shall have succeeded against Lord Cornwallis, will readily suggest itself, to you, and if not, the knowledge of it may prove advantageous.  I am, Sir, with the most perfect esteem, Your Excellency's Most obedient Servant, Tho M:Kean  ""

  Sir, (Private) Philadelphia October 15th. 1781. The intelligence you have from time to time communicated to Congress has been very satisfactory, and always corroborated what I had derived thro' other channels.  I am now to inform you of some facts of the utmost importance: however you may be at a loss to account for numbers or circumstances, believe me, they are founded on the best evidence, and perfectly true in all respects.  Sir Henry Clinton is ready to sail in person with upwards of five thousand chosen Troops rank & file, on board the British fleet, now consisting of twenty nine Line of battle ships, besides Frigates & ten Fire-Ships. The General & Flag Officers held a Council of war on the 24th September last at New-York, and determined at all hazards to proceed to the Chesapeak and endeavor to relieve Lord Cornwallis, and, tho' then they had but 26 ships of the Line, to fight the French Fleet and land their Troops; they expected to be ready to sail on the fifth instant, but had not sailed (I believe) on Thursday the 11th.  As soon as you have heard of the fleet's sailing you may depend upon it, there are near six thousand of the best Troops on board, and in consequence there cannot be above four thousand of all sorts remaining in New-York and it's Environs. These must be scattered on Long-Island, Staaten Island near Kings-bridge, and Paulus Hook.  In this situation of affairs would it not be adviseable to think seriously of an Attack on New-York? You may obtain five thousand militia in a few days to co-operate with you. I rest assured you will be in readiness to execute any orders you may receive from the Commander in Chief on this head. General Washington and Count de Grasse will in a very few days be informed of all these particulars, as I have dispatched Expresses to each by the nearest routs.(1)  I have the honor to be, with very great regard, Sir, Your most  obedient humble Servant, Tho M: Kean OCTOBER 16, 1781  ""

As to the operations with you, we are perfect Strangers to them, We hear you are near the Enemy but know nothing of your prospects. I hope they are favourable and that you make considerable progress-but I am not without my fears, from the Forces collecting at New York in all probability to relieve Cornwallis-their fleet is far from Contemptable, near or quite thirty ships of the Line besides frigates, fire Ships &c. We have not heard of their Sailing yet, I believe they are only waiting for a fair wind, they have, reports say, Six thousand troops embarked, their destination must be either Virginia or Carolina; I hope however the S W winds will keep them back till your work is fully Accomplished-the weather is uncommonly favourable for your Operations, and I hope a kind providence will direct every Element to favour our designs.  We have been long Alarmed in the Jerseys by the Enemy encamped with most of their Army on Staten Island but as they are now mostly imbarked, fears in that quarter seems to Subside.

  Dear Sir Philada. Ocr. 16th. 1781. When you get a sight of the Resolution of the Gen. Ass. referred to in your favor of the 8th (1) you will readily judge from the tenor of it what steps would be taken by the Delegates. It necessarily submitted the fate of the object in question to the discretion and prospects of the Gentleman whom reports it seems have arraigned to you, but who I am bound in justice to testify has entirely suported the character which he formerly held with you. I am somewhat surprized that you never had before known of the Resolution just mentioned especially as, what is indeed much more surprizing it was both debated & passed with open doors & a full gallery. This circumstance alone must have defeated any reservations attached to it.  The N. York papers and the intelligence from thence make it evident that they have no hope of relieving Cornwallis, unless it can be effected by some desperate naval experiment and that such an one will be made. Their force will probably amount to 26 Sail of the line, and if we are not misinformed as to the late arrival of three ships of the line to 29 Sail. The superiority still remaining on the part of our Allies and the repeated proofs given of their skill & bravery on the water forbid any apprehension of danger. At the same time we can not help calculating that every addition to the British force proportionally diminishes the certainty of success. A fleet of provisions amounting to about 40 Sail convoyed by a 44 & 2 frigates have arrived at N York within the week past.  Having sent all the papers containing the proceedings on the case of Mr. N. agst. V. as they came out, I shall to complete your view of it add the last effort in his favor published in the inclosed No. of the Freemans Journal.

  Sir Philadelphia Oct. 16. 1781 Your excellency's favor of the 5th instant (1) gives us great reason to flatter ourselves upon the present prospect in Virginia. Intelligence from New-York announces a fixed purpose in Sir Henry Clinton to force his way into the Chesapeake, with a fleet of 26 certainly, and probably of 29, ships of the line and ten fireships. But we trust, that the bravery and ability, which have hitherto distinguished the French nation, and were so eminently displayed in the late rencontre of the duke de Lauzun,(2) will destroy the illusive opinion of Great Britain, that she reigns the sovereign of the sea.  We learn from the same source of information, that about 40 transports have arrived at New-York under convoy of a ship of 44 guns and two frigates.  In our letter of the last week, we promised a copy of our protest against the proceedings of a committee of congress with respect to our western territory.(3) Since that time we received notice to attend on Saturday last at a conference between the committee and the agent for the Illinois, Ouabache, and Indiana companies. We requested the committee to postpone the conference, until the extent of their power should be ascertained by a vote of congress: but we found, that application had been made for postponing by the agent. This business was adjourned to Thursday, and will then be entered upon, unless we can arrest it by a motion this morning.(4) It is our wish therefore to defer any farther communication on this head, until the fate of the intended motion shall be known.  Altho' we have refused to submit the territorial rights of Virginia to this committee, we cannot forbear to recommend, from an experience of the calumnies, to which her title is daily exposed, that a representation of her claims should be prepared, and authentic documents collected, at the instance of government.(5) The time may come, when the exercise of jurisdiction in congress will not be so objectionable, and so much opposed to the confederation, as the conduct of the committee now is. Should the cessions of Virginia and New-York be rejected, a contest may possibly arise between them, on the subject of the ceded territory. Impressed by the importance of these considerations, and the danger of injury to public records in a season of war, New-York has compiled every paper, OCTOBER 16, 1781  which bears the most distant reference to her claims. Ought not Virginia to be equally wakful? She would derive much advantage, were a copy of her title-papers transmitted to her delegates in congress. At present tho' we are conscious of the justice of her demands, and may probably from memory run thro' the grounds of them, we shall not consider ourselves fully armed, until we are furnished in the most authentic, formal and official manner.  We shall endeavour to secure to Virginia her proportion of clothing, agreeably to your excellency's recommendation.(6)  We have the honor to be, Sir, with great respect, Yr mo. obt. servts. Jos.

  My dearest Love, Philadelphia Octr. 21 1781 I am sorry you did not oblige me by leaving a Line to come by the Stage on Tuesday, as I have remained in great anxiety for you & my dear Daughter. I wrote by the Stage on Thursday in hopes you were there, as I did not hear of your setting out for home, till Dr. Rodgers came on Friday. This painful Separation is not the thing; it seems like shortening the little Time that yet remains for us. My Mind has been rather gloomy, by reason of so many distresses of my Friends on every Quarter. I suppose you have heard of the sudden & unexpected Death of our Friend Dr. Scudder.  He went out as usual to see his Patients, on the way met Genl Forman, who was getting a few Men together to drive off some refugees that had landed on the Shore. They went together & found them in their Boats & just pushed off-on the Enemy seeing them coming down, at about 500 Yards distance, one of them fired his Piece, a random Shot, but commissioned from above. The Ball entered just on one side of the Nose & went thro' the Doctors Head-he died in about 2 Hours, thus a helpless Family is left in very destitute Circumstances, as I believe the Doctors attention to Politicks has been very prejudicial to his little Estate. My heart bleeds for his widow & Children-but what is even this, at New London 66 widows were made in one day. One poor Woman carried off the Corpses of her husband & five Sons at once.  These are times of distress indeed. May God of his infinite Mercy make us thankfull for his uncounted Favours to Us, and enable us to stand with our Loins girt & Lamps trimmed allways waiting for the Comeing of the Bridegroom.  A Letter of the 12th from the Genl. informd us, that the 9th & 10 the Trenches were opened and the fire of about 28 or 29 Cannon let loose on the enemy with about 8 or 10 Mortars.(1) The Enemy's Cannon were soon silenced as the distance was but abt 500 yards. The second Parralell was then formed without much annoyance, which brings us within 300 Yards. The Enemy's Works was much damaged & several british Officers & Many Men were killed-three of their Vessels had been burned with red hot Shot. As soon as the Batteries of the 2d Parralell were opened with the 42 pounders, which would be perhaps the 14th, it was thought nothing could stand before them. The General expected that his Lordship would make a desperate Sally the Night of the 12th or the 13th. The English Fleet of 26 Sail & 5000 Troops sailed on Friday Night from the Hook, the news of which must have got to Genl Washington this Evening, so that he will be prepared for them, tho' as the Wind stands, it will be many Days before they get to the Chesapeak.  OCTOBER 22, 1781  Clinton recd a Letter from Cornwallis, dated the 8th intreating for aid & assistance, with the Importunity of a Courtier, but hope he is too late, tho we all know, that the Battle is not allways to the strong nor the Race to the Swift. My Comfort is that the will of God, will certainly be done.  As I am & shall be particularly hurried for 2 days to come, I shan't have time to write to Lewis, let him have this News as soon as you can.  Monday Morning (2)-8 oClock. At three oClock this Morning, an Express arrived with the glorious News of the Surrender of Lord Cornwallis with his whole Army. God be praised. It was on Wednesday last. I congratulate you and all our Friends.  Yours E B.(3) ""

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia Octr 22, 1781 Here I am laid fast by the heels, tho' God knows, I have committed neither Treason, Murder, felony, or any other misdemeanor; but my misfortune proceeds entirely from the malice of a grim surly scoundrel, a Mr. Gout. He has attacked me with the height of his venom & for eight days past has given me little peace. However he has at last relented, & permits me to address a few lines to you by Mr. Bee.(1)  I most sincerely congratulate you on your late victory. It was truely important, and glorious, & every well wisher to our cause, eagerly bestows on you that tribute of praise, which is so justly due to your abilities. May Heaven continue to prosper your undertakings & crown you with compleat success. You have already won more laurels than comes to the share of one person, it is true, but they cannot better be bestowed; as I am convinced they can never have the effects on you that they but too frequently have on weak minds; on the contrary, that each acquisition will rather serve as a stimulus to new exertions & more forcibly prove you the firm Patriot, the able General, & familiar Gentleman.  And now My friend, permit me to give you a word of advice, or rather remonstrance. I am told from good authority that you expose yourself in time of action as a common man. In this I must take the OCTOBER 22, 1781  liberty to say I think you very wrong. How often has compleat victory been snatched from an almost Conquering Army by the untimely fall of an able & much respected commander. Consider my Dr Sir, our country essentially depends on your abilities for her deliverance. The progress you have already made in this great work, has given them a confidence in you which could not be readily impressed on them by a Successor; in the mean-time confusion & a thousand inconveniencies must ensue. I'll say no more.  I wrote you in my last that the eyes of all the world was upon you in the affair of Collo Hayne.(2) You have the full powers from Congress, & I dare say you will make a proper use of them. Retaliation for that murder must be had; but the longer it is delayed, the less influence it will have. I can't think there is a necessity for the subject of retaliation being of the same rank; the whole matter is-have you the spirit to put to death a BRITISH OFFICER. Once convince them that we dare do it, & the matter is settled, & my head for it, you will hear of no more executions on their Part. I refer you for news to our letter to the Governor.(3)  I am My Dr. sir, with the most sincere Esteem, yr. Obedt. Servt. Jno. Mathews  P.S. Victory seems at length to have taken her seat on the American standard, & if that fickle Bitch Madam fortune does not outmanuvre Us, we shall, I think, regain Chs. town 'ere long.

  Sir, Philada. Octor. 23d. 1781 The Instructions from the Legislature respecting the Western Lands and Indiania Claim &c. have been recd and attended to.(1) The Cession of Virginia & the Indiania Claim &c are before a Committee who have not yet reported. The few states at present represented in Congress will render any proceeding in this business difficul[t] if not impracticable, a determination cannot be had without a fuller Representation .  With regard to a Division of the Islands and Bars in Delaware Bay S River,(2) I beg leave with all due deference to the Opinion of the Legislature to propose to your consideration whether it will not be best to apply to the Legislatures of Pennsa. & Delaware for such a Division previous to any Application for the appointment of Commissrs.-a settlement by Commrs. Agreable to the Confederation will be attended with a large expense when in all probability the Business can be effected by the Legislatures with little if any. Mr. McKean assures me the Legislature of Delaware will chearfully come into the Settlement you propose, they are sensible of the Necessity of the measure; he informs me their grant takes in all the Islands in Delaware Bay, but thinks they will Notwithstanding Divide with us. I do not remember the bounds of the grant to New Jersey so far as may respect the Islands, & have never seen those of Pennsa. and Delaware. With regard to Pennsa. if a settlement can be effected by Acts of the Legislature, it will be the most Cheap and Expeditious method, and I cannot yet find there will be any Objection to it here, it can at least be proposed to the Legislature, but those Applications your Delegates are not empowered to make.  I have Conversed with all my Colleagues upon this Subject (except Dr. Witherspoon who hath just made his appearance) and find we all concur in Opinion, but we are all equally at a loss of the meaning of the words, Saving and reserving to all persons in their Legal S Equitable Claims,-as in the preceeding words you Claim all such Islands and Bars as lie between the Jersey shore and the main Channel of Delaware Bay s River with the Right of Soil and Jurisdiction. In the grant to New Jersey both soil and Jurisdiction are granted, the soil is become the property of the West Jersey proprietors that is all such Land as is within the Limits, those Limits being Settled, I suppose no person can have a Legal claim within the same except under the proprietors, and it can hardly be Supposed the Legislature meant to Countenance any Claim under Pennsylva. or Delaware within such bounds, tho' the words equitable Claims seems to hold up such an Idea in favour of long possession. If this is intended, nothing short of Laws in the respective states can be OCTOBER 23, 1781  binding; Commrs. can have not to do with the private Rights of Individuals in Cases like these. If it should be the pleasure of the Legislature to make any proposals to Pennsyla. & Delaware, I think the same should be pointed out with precision, or at least such precision pointed out to such as may be empowered to Negociate the business. Might I give my Opinion, I should suppose the Main Channel a proper boundary as far as the tide flows; beyond that, where the main Channel cannot be Ascertained by depth of water- Island Lying nearest the shore of either state to belong to such state; as this may only respect Jurisdiction, the Right of Soil will require particular Attention in which possibly respect will be had, to possessions of longstanding which had in the first Acquiring them the Appearance of Legallity on their side.

  Dear Doctr. Philadelphia October 23d. 1781 I thank you for your letter of the 16th and for the information it Contains-it affords me great pleasure to hear that your mother is recovered from her late Illness, that the Dear little ones are well and that you are on the mending hand. You have acted wisely I think in giving up your magestrates Commission. I allways was fearful that the multiplicity of Business you was engaged in was prejudicial to your health and am therefore very glad you have resigned part of it. The British property in Frederick I think is well Sold. I by no means Condem your purchase-it will make you Easy on account of a house to live in for the present and Should you incline to Sell it hereafter it is probable you will not lose by it.  I Should have been glad to have purchased one of the Lotts sold to Magruder and Gant but as it would have laid me under the disagreeable necessity of asking for Security, and as the payments might perhaps have embarrassed me, I thought it more prudent to decline, especially too as I thought it would go very high. I have expectations of adding to my land under the Mountain, which a purchase might have prevented however I wrote to you on the Subject Just after my Arrival here, which it Seems you did not receive. Colo Price has been lucky in his purchase which I am very glad off. I wish Mr Harrisons purchase may turn out to his Advantage. I am afraid the Situation is unhealthy. He has a numerous family and Should it turn out So they must be misserable. OCTOBER 23, 1781  I Congratulate you most sincerely on the Surrender of Lord Cornwallis to Gen. Washington, of which most important Event, we have information by a Letter from the Count de Grasse dated the 18th to Governor Lee and by him forwarded to the President of Congress by Express. The particulars we Expect to receive from General Washington in two or three days. The Counts Letter is as follows. \""I have Just desired Genral Washington to Send me back my Troops of which probably he will no longer Stand in need as Lord Cornwallis has Surrended, as soon as they are embarked I shall quit the Bay of Chesapeake, And endeavour still to Cooperate to the welfare of the united States in stopping If I can Sir Henry Clinton.\"" The British fleet sailed from the Hook on the l9th in the evening And as the winds have been unfavourable for them it is probable the Count will get out before they make our Capes, And as his force is greatly Superior to the British Should they Come to blows the most favourable Issue for us may be expected. The Capture of Cornwallis with the great number of Vessels and the large quantity of British and West India Goods, Arms &c that must have fallen into hands, is a most Capital Stroke and will tend more towards obtaining peace and to the security of our Independance than the best managed negotiations. I was ever of Opinion, that no depredations upon the trade of the English, no Conquests of their possessions in the East and West Indias, will induce them to make peace, while they have An Army in the united states, And Can flatter themselves, with the hopes of Conquering or regaining America, because it is probable they think that with America under their Government, they Can Easily regain whatever they may loose now in any part of the world whereas the total expulsion or Captivity of their forces in the united states would extinguish their hopes and dispose them to peace Sooner than Any thing Else.

The Assaults commenced almost at the same Moment, and were conducted & executed with the true spirit &Judgment of Officers & Men who fought in the Cause of human Nature. Both redoubts were carried in Ten Minutes with very little Loss. This Success was heightened by the true bravery displayed by the Troops of both nations, disarming themselves of resentmt., and giving Quarters to the abject Brittons on their Knees begging for Mercy.  This conduct contrasted with English humanity displayed at Groton, must stamp their Character (if possible) with a still deeper dye.

They pushed into the Trenches, between two unfinished Batteries, where the Line was thin and passed to the Guns, which they spiked. But it was no sooner known among the French Troops (in whose quarter it happened) than they were forced by the Bayonet, to return to their Cells with considerable Loss.

Those will be the property of the french as we had no Ships of war acting with theirs. Between two and three hundred light Horse, and about 2500 Infantry have marched from York to reinforce General Green who by the last Accounts is moving down towards Charles Town-the Enemy having Evacuated every other post in South Carolina. You See that Cornwallis's Captive Troops are to be Stationed in Virginia, Maryland & Pensylvania, it is likely Frederick Town will have the greater part of those that Come to Maryland. Would it not be for the advantage and quiet of the Inhabitants to have them Confined? And for that purpose would it not be right to Consult the Governor and Council about haveing the Barracks immediately picketted in? Such a number of prisoners will Increase the demand for provisions. I would not therefore have Any more of my Grain Sold till they Arrive.  What will the Tories and refugees think of their British friends when they find by the Answer to the 10th Article of Capitulation that these of the Garrison are made prisoners of war, and given up by Lord Cornwallis to the Civil Power. Poor Devils how they have been deluded and deserted upon all Occasions.  By Authority deserving of Some Credance, Six of the united Provinces are for Acknowledging our Independence, and that, Zealand the only province Against it will Shortly Concur.  God Bless the little ones and that this may find you all well is my Sincere wish. Yrs. J H  ""

  My dear Brother, Philadelphia Octr. 30th. 1781. There has nothing new turned up since my last, advising you of the Capture of Lord Cornwallis. The official Returns have not yet come to hand. I mentioned your Man not calling on me with your Letter, which was the Reason that you had not the Sugars. On examining into those of Mrs. Pollards, I found them, tho' good, not the best.  I therefore recd the cash, and have purchased you a Barrell of the very best, but as I have lost your Memorandum, I cannot remember  OCTOBER 30, 1781  any thing but Sugar, and do not know the Quantity you require.  Poor Viellor has not got thro' his Trouble, after bringing an Action in this State on the Judgment of the Sp. Bail, Mr. Patterson has given me Notice that he intends to move the Court on Thursday in Term, to vacate the Case-Judgmt & all Proceedings on the Judgmt.  I suspect he has 2 Objections-1 that the Case was issued in Burlington instead of Gloucester. This I am afraid is true, as I was not acquainted with the County & it was mere Form, the Deft. beeing then at Sea.-2d That the Service of the Scr. Fa.(1) was in Philadelphia out of the County. The Fact is so but the Sheriff has returnd the Scr. Feci.(2) and the Fact does not appear. The Bail had a House & Land in the County, but out of kindness, also acquainted Deft in form with it in Philadelphia.  The Answer to all this is, that the Judgment is made up & signed and cannot be reversed but by writ of Error. If this is done the Deft. must give good Security. As it is doubtfull whether I shall be at Court, do prepare for this Business & exert yourself. Perhaps you may prevail on A Ogden to assist you, on engaging him a couple of half Johas when the Monies are recd-which we may pay him ourselves.  I really pity the poor Man, who is starving here, only waiting the issue of this unhappy Affair. He is almost distracted and the Deft. in the Scr. Fa. is sued in this Court here on the Judgment.  My kind Love to Sister & all Friends. Pray call at my House & take my Extracts with you to Court.  Am with great Regard, Yours Afftly, E. Boudinot  ""

  Dear Sir Philada. Ocr. 30th. 1781. I return you my fervent congratulations on the glorious success of the combined arms at York & Glocester. We have had from the Commander in chief a official report of the fact with a copy of the capitulation, and a general intimation that the no. of prisoners excluding seamen &c. would exceed 5000; but no detail of our gains. If these severe doses of ill fortune do not cool the phrenzy and relax the pride of Britain, it would seem as if Heaven had in reality abandoned her to her folly & her fate. This campaign was grounded on the most intense exertion of her pecuniary resources.  OCTOBER 30, 1781  Upwards of 20 Millions were voted by the Parliament. The King acknowledged that it was all he asked, and all that was necessary. A fair trial has then been made of her strength: and what is the result? They have lost another army, another colony, another island, and another fleet of her trade; their possessions in the E. Indies which were so rich a source of their commerce & credit, have been severed from them perhaps for ever: their naval armaments, the bulwarks of their safety & the idols of their vanity have in every contest felt the rising Superiority of their Enemies. In no points have they succeeded except in the predatory conquest of Eustatia of which they have lost the greatest part of every thing except the infamy, and in the relief of Gibralter which was merely a negative advantage. With what hope or with what view can they try the fortune of another campaign? Unless they can draw succour from the compassion or jealousy of other powers of which it does not yet appear that they have any well founded expectation, it seems scarcely possible for them much longer to shut their ears against the voice of peace.  I am sorry to find that the practice of impressing is still kept up with you.(1) It is partial & oppressive with respect to individuals, & I wish it may not eventually prove so with respect to the State. The zeal & liberality of those State[s] which make undue advances may not find an equal disposition to reimbur[se] them in others which have had more caution or less occasion for such exertions.  You are not mistaken in your apprehensions for our Western Interests. An agrarian law is as much coveted by the little members of the Union, as ever it was by the indigent Citizens of Rome. The conditions annexed by Virginia to her territorial cession has furnished a Committee of Congress a handle for taking up questions of right both with respect to the Ceding States, and the great land companies which they have not before ventured to touch. We have made every opposition & remonstrance to the Conduct of the Committee which the forms of proceeding will admit. When a report is made we shall renew our efforts upon more eligible ground, but with little hope of arresting any aggression upon Virginia which depends solely on the inclination of Congress.(2) Since the close of the Confederation however, it has been understood that seven votes are necessary to carry every question. This rule in proportion to the thinness of Congress opposes a difficulty to those who attack. It will therefore I believe be impossible for the Enemys of Virginia to obtain any positive injury to her rights. My greatest anxiety at present is lest the attempts for that purpose may exasperate the Assembly into measures which will furnish new hopes to the British Court to persevere in the war, and new baits for the credulity of the British nation. The good sense of the Assembly will however I flatter myself temper every expressi[on of] their displeasure with a due respect to thi[s con]sideration. It would be peculiarly unhappy  if any symptoms of disunion among ourselves should blast the golden prospects which the events of the campaign have opened to us. We have nothing new from any quarter. The British fleet has not returned to N. York as was here reported & believed. It consists of 25 sail of the line, several 50s and frigates. The no. of Troops is varied by our intelligence from 4 to upwards of 6000.  With sincere regard I am Dr Sir Yrs &c,  J. Madison Junr.  P.S. A report came yesterday from Baltimore, that Rodney with several Ships of the line & 30 or 40 transports laden in part with the residue of Statia plunder has fallen into the hands of the combined fleets. This morning the same report coming from N. York gives some probability to the thing.  ""

I suppose that by this time you have receivd the particulars of Cornwallis' Reduction so far as they have been come to our hand. We have not receivd any returns of the number of prisoners or Quantity of Stores. Colo. De Hart arrived here last evening from Head Quarters who says that he was informd by the Commissary of Prisoners that there were at least Seven thousand prisoners, besides Marines & Sailors, who surrendered to Genl Washington.

  Sir. Philadelphia 30th Octr. 1781. I have received the Letter you did me the honor to write by Capt. Pierce, and added to the Joy arising from the Annunciation of a splendid Victory, obtained thro' the severest Conflict that has OCTOBER 30,1781  marked the present War ,(1) I felt a peculiar Pleasure in the Reflection that the Brows of my worthy Friend were encircled with unfading Laurels. Be assured Sir, that it is the universal Opinion here that there never was a warmer Action, or a Victory more arduously obtained. I hope you will be able, before this reaches you, to confine the Enemy to their defensive Positions, & smile at their Attempts to force you upon Expedients. Happy indeed has been the Fate of our worthy Commander in Chief! With an astonishing Rapidity he flew to the Dominion, & perfected Strength in Weakness. Glorious has been the Conduct of our Ally, & important, beyond Description, the Success of the allied Arms.  Parson Rogers lately came from Rhode-Island; he saw your good Lady; She was preparing for a Journey to the Southward, & expected to be in Philadelphia next Monday week; I have not wrote her for two Weeks past, thinking my Letter might not find her; But shall have the Honor of waiting upon her, should she accomplish her Intentions, as I shall not leave this Place before that Time. I assure you, I am very ignorant of Matters in Rhode-Island. Governor Greene writes once in three Months, and then acknowledges the Receipt of a Letter, and some others that he has forgot, and concludes with \""your very humble Servt.\"" My only constant Correspondent is Mrs. Greene; The Subjects upon wch. we write will not admit of any unanimating Relations; besides, a Lady of fine Sensibility collects more from the delicate Flights of Imagination than the Jejune Narratives of Country Circles, or a lying Gazette. We have this day chosen Genl. Lincoln Secretary at War.(2) I hope he will execute the Duties of that Department with Propriety. It was the best Choice we could make; Your cursed Popularity to the Southward, prevented your Election, as it is supposed you alone can save the Southern States from Hell. I believe there is some Propriety in the Sentiment. I rejoice at the Confidence, but abominate the Application of it, as endless Fatigue is the Consequence of their Affection. This is a strange World, and Congress is nothing more than a true Epitome [of] it. They are like all other unwieldly legislatures; And we are obliged frequently to suppress our Judgement in some things, in Order to obtain others; & those perhaps in a mangled form. If we were all great Men, we should not always think & decide alike; But I confess to you I am of a small Number that are ignorant of the true Interests of the United States; & altho' we are few compared to the whole Numbers that compose Congress, yet thro our Stupidity we give them much trouble; but as for one I cannot act without being convinced, & not being capable of Conviction in many Instances, I shall make all the Satisfaction in my Power, by leaving them soon; thereby lessening the small Number of Fools.  Congress have gone thro' the Tribute of Thanks &c. I hope their Acknowledgments will be satisfactory to you.(3) I tried to obtain a  OCTOBER 31,1781  military Grade; but the Name Lieut. Genl. sounded unholy, and I was called a Fool, being combated with this Argument, I was silent, Not that I was Convinced any Conclusion could be drawn from the Truth of that Proposition derogatory to the Motion, But the Argumentum ad Hominum, is general irresistable. It has the same Effect as a loud Laugh when rudely applied; And if Modesty does not blush, Indignation will prevent Utterance; Especially when Laughter is succeeded by a Peel of murmuring Applause.

  Dear sir, Philadelphia Nov 6th, 1781 You will receive from the Financier a recommendation to our state, to raise its Quota of 8,000,000 dollers, for the service of the insuing year.(1) This Quota, being 373,598 dollers, which you will find by calculation is nearly a one & twentyeth part of the whole 8,000,000, is as I suppose, eighty or ninety thousand dollers more than it ought to be. And this I urged to the Committee that made the Quotas, of which committee I was one, & also to congress, when it was under debate before them, but without success. I now write this to you, & to the honourable court, that you may judge, as I know you can much better than I, first, whether the state is overcharged in the manner above supposed; but secondly & principally, that the Court being informed of the case, may maturely consider and determine what ought to be done, in respect of complying with the requisition, which would establish in some measure, by acquiescence, their quota for the future. I feel on the one hand the importance of an immediate complyance with the requisition, knowing the bad constructions that both our friends & enemys, respectively, might put upon any thing that looks like an evasion, or removing  NOVEMBER 6, 1781  our shoulder from the burthen; on the other hand, a complyance with a requisition so manifestly out of all proportion may tend to destroy that confidence which the Cityzens of our state at large have and ought to have in the Court. You know, that by the confederation, the states should be Quotaed according to the amount of the value of their land; but an estimate of this value has never been made. The committee therefore took for the basis of their quotas the proportion made by a resolution of Congress the 29th of July 1775 (which please to turn to) (2) founded on the supposed number of inhabitants in the several states, wherein our numbers were unfortunately supposed to be 100,000; & our quota of 3,000,000 dollers was 124,069 1/2 dols.  The respective number of inhabitants tho not inserted in the Journals, I am informed were as follows, N.H. 100,000 Pensyla. 300,000 Masa. 350,000 Dela. 30,000 Rhd. 60,000 Mard. 250,000 Cont. 200,000 Virga. 400,000 N. York 200,000 N. Cara. 200,000 N. Jersy 130,000 S. Cara. 200,000 the whole 2,420,000 But afterwards a true estimate of our numbers was made, and being represented to congress, by our delegates in 1779, to be abt.76,000, our quota was established accordingly, as Mr W Langdond & Col Peabody can inform. We were quotaed in Octob 1779, 400,000 to 15,000,000 dollers which is about a seven & thirtyeth part. I do not know how that was calculated. I take our just proportion to be abt a three & thirtyeth part, besides our proportion required to make up the deficiencies of those states that are disabled by the ravages of war. If the court should think it best to make a representation of this matter to Congress, in order to get the quota set right, before they proceed to raise the mony, it will be necessary to prove, as clearly as possible, that our number of inhabitants did not exceed 76,000 in 1775; because it has been asserted here, that we had 100,000 inhabitants, by a Census taken before the revolution. Now the whole of my complaint is, that we are taxed for 100,000, instead of being taxed for 76,000. I presume this will find the Court sitting, so you will soon come to a determination upon the subject.(3) We have nothing from Vermont. Twenty four standards of Ld Cornwallis army brot to congress last Saturday, displayed & paraded through the city, made a most pleasing appearance. Particulars you will have in the paper inclosed. Your most obedient humble servant. Samuel Livermore P.S. The resolution of congress says this proportion shall not be drawn into example in future. All the former resolutions have said  to the same purpose: nevertheless congress have expressly taken the erroneous pioneer guess-work proportion of 1775 for the basis of this. It is further held forth that if any state is now over burthened they shall be recompensed hereafter. I fear this word hereafter is to be taken in a theological sense.  Yesterday being the day appointed to elect a president Mr. Hanson of Maryland was elected.  ""

  Dear sir Philadelphia Novr. 7. 1781. I am happy in acknowledging the receipt of your late friendly letter. I need not particularize the date, as you will readily call to mind, that it is the only one, which you have written to me, since my departure from Virginia.  The capitulation of York will create leisure to our country, to weigh the crisis of her situation. I give her present circumstances the appallation of a crisis, because upon the measures, which she may now adopt, depends her rank in the political world. A passage in your letter has taken up one of the subjects, to which I allude: the delegates are almost worn down with motions respecting your cession of western territory. The disgust and jealousy, conceived against Virginia, leave us the bare consolation of having deserved some degree of success; for in no instance have we obtained the smallest. The history of this business is not lengthy. The report of the committee, to whom the cessions of New York, Virginia and Connecticut, and the memorials of the Vandalia, Illinois, Ouabache and Indiana companies were referred, was recommitted to five other gentlemen.(1) Being informed, that New-York and Connecticut proposed to unfold all their title-papers, we attended the committee, but informed them, that we did not hold ourselves bound by the example of the two other states, nay that we were not free, to submit to the inspection and decision of even congress itself the charters and other territorial documents of Virginia. We grounded our opinion of this limitation of our power, upon the resolutions of congress, which first procured our cession, and which, as they openly and explicitly professed to be intended to stifle all inquiries into territorial rights, were an actual fraud upon Virginia, if her rights of this nature were to be discussed. Nor could we forbear NOVEMBER 7, 1781  Portrait of Edmund Randolph  reprobating this assumption of jurisdiction, as contrary to the confederation, because not delegated by it. These remonstrances being made, we listened to a voluminous detail of the title of New-York. She principally builds her demands on grants from the Six nations, and thereby becomes a competitor for an important portion of the chartered Soil of Virginia. Connecticut, in her turn, was short resting herself on the Plymouth Charter, and purchases, made thereon and confirmed by Charles the 2d. Virginia then delivered in to the committee written reasons for declining a Similar politeness.(2) Soon afterwards we received notice, that the committee were about to confer with the agents of these land companies. It was our idea, that, as the cessions of the states, and the memorials of the companies had been originally referred in general terms, and the report upon them had been recommitted in terms, equally general, the committee had no power to proceed to hear counsel, receive evidence and go thro' the various forms of a regular forensic argument. Certainly we had propriety on our side. For it appeared on the face of the memorials themselves, that the subscribers to them claimed lands within the limits contended for by Virginia. To say nothing therefore of the resolutions above mentioned, if those lands lay within Virginia, to her and her tribunals alone ought the appeal to be made: if out of Virginia, the confederation does not authorize congress to decide in any manner concerning them. Add to this that it derogates from the dignity of a sovereign state to be drawn into contest with any individual, or body of individuals. These doctrines tho' urged in numberless shapes, could not prevail on congress to arrest the committee in their career.(3) A new report was accordingly made on Saturday last, in which it is recommended to Virginia to make a cession with different reservations and conditions. It still remains undetermined by the house. I shall forward the particulars to you upon the completion of the affair;(4) but in the mean time expect nothing favorable. I foresee, that Virginia will repeal her cession.  I have observed thus much, because I perceive from your letter, that you wished for some information on the subject. But, my dear sir, I trust, I may indulge myself in believing, that the present assembly will not be irritated to pursue any harsh conduct, at any rate until an official account of the whole matter shall be transmitted by us. Until congress shall pass their judgment on this report, it would be premature to enter into any public act respecting it. But let a greater point be consulted. The late capture of the british army opens the avenue to peace. It will be instantaneously shut up, if Great-Britain should have a single glance of a fracture in the American chain. The great ally too, whom we already have, and the two other powers whose fr[iend]ship we solicit, may be shocked at such a procedure. But, let the event of the present report be what it will, I   hope, that no legislative act may be done, beyond a protest against the authority, now exercised by congress, and a repeal of our cession.  What I mean by a crisis, is by this time plainly seen. Virginia is thus found not merely destitute of friends, but surrounded by those, who labour to retrench her territory. The enmity to her, tho' produced originally by her extent of soil, easily interweaves itself into other matters in which she is concerned. It is incumbent therefore on those, who are at the helm of government, to render her formidable by a happy management of her resources, and by these means to produce the respect, due to her real importance.  I am justified in saying, that she possesses real importance, when I recollect the quota, assigned to her, out of the eight millions of specie dollars, called for by congress for the ensuing year. The confederation, you know, has fixed the proportions of the states according to the value of the land granted and surveyed. There has not been sufficient time, since its final ratification, to procure such an estimate. Recourse was therefore necessarily had to capitation. But even here we had no accurate rule of computation as we had not access to any census of inhabitants in the united States. The numbers, as stated by the delegates in 1775, were considered as the basis of calculation.(5) Upon this principle our quota would amount to 1,323,408 dollars. On account of the ravages of war a deduction was made of 1/8. New York received also an abatement of 1/2, North Carolina of 1/6, South-Carolina of 1/2 and Georgia of 2/3. But these deficiencies were afterwards distributed among all the states in proportion to their remaining sums. So that Virginia loses much of the advantage, gained by the remission of 1/8, from the circumstance of being obliged to bear a proportion of these deficiencies; her present quota being about 1,300,000. However, every farthing, which has been, and will be, advanced, before the land is ascertained, will be credited to the States, and whichsoever of them shall overpay its just quota, upon this Scale, will receive interest of 6 percent: per annum. The inclosed paper is the rough draught of a calculation, to determine the proportions, hitherto paid by the different states.  I was extending this letter farther, when I recollected, that the hour of congress is at hand, and that if I wrote any thing more, it should be in transcribing these hasty and blotted pages. But, as the correspondence of friends requires no great nicety, I shall only repeat that I am Dr Sir, yrs. sincerely,  Edm. Randolph.  ""

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia Nov. 13th 1781  I recd. your friendly letter of the 30th ulto. It gave me pleasure and surprize to find how soon you got the good news of the taking Ld. Cornwallis. I suppose my letters, news papers &ca coming to hand long after must have been like a last years Almanack, however they might help you to some particulars.  I am still in the dark about Vermont, and impatient to hear their determination about complying with the resolution of congress. Their allowing you to hold the Supr. Court in the county of Cheshire in Octo. with other circumstances which I recd. in a letter from Newhampshire I thought looked like giving up the east of the river; but I see by the News-paper they are demanding taxes of above fifty of our towns in Cheshire & Grafton. And a flying rumour is here that they have chosen a Governour east of Connecticut river.(1) No one has sent me your new plan of govmt. and I hear nothing about it whether it is received or not.(2) In my last vizt. Nov. 6th I dwelt pretty largely upon the subject of our being over rated in the genl tax for the year '82, which prevented my saying any thing upon the tax in general: For which reason give me leave to make a few observations here. In the first place it was thought necessary to raise the sum of 8 million dollers for the year 1782. Perhaps the large debt we are in, and the interest we must annually pay, might influence the minds of some to raise so heavy a tax. Others perhaps think it best to demand a large sum to gain a small one: and that there is more room for those that choose to be deficient, & to pay nothing, when a redundancy is required. But to come nearer the point, can the united states pay 8 million? This question will be answered by another, viz, can N. Hampshire pay her quota of it, properly adjusted? Not in hard mony I suppose. Yet her utmost power has never been tryd, perhaps she can do more than we imagine. I allow her proportion rightly adjusted is 300,000 dollers, that is 5,000 yoke of oxen at 60 dollers a yoke. We can pay that. Nay we can make the oxen pay it, & not pay a shilling out ourselves. This would be financiering with a witness. I suppose a yoke of oxen to every three men, which wd. no doubt amount to 5,000 yoke. But you will say it is silver & not oxen that is demanded, true: but the art required is to turn these oxen of N.H. the cloathing, the flour, the forrage, the horses & waggons &ca &ca, of other states into cash, or which is the same thing, to receive them specifically for the publick use. This we trust the great abilitys of our Financier to bring about. Your &c. Sam Livermore  [P.S.] Let no one think that I consider oxen as the only sorce of wealth in Newhampshire, far from it, I know we have horses and NOVEMBER 13, 1781  other stock, corn, wheat, lumber, shipbuilding and other articles. My meaning is to shew that the tax may be drawn from a single source much more then from the whole of our joint resources, if we have art enough to draw them forth. Perhaps I have over rated or under rated the number of oxen in the state, 'tis done by meer conjecture still the thought may be improved by those who are better acquainted with the facts. My only view is to shew the possibility, nay the ease of discharging the tax, if my thoughts concur with yours upon the subject, or are of any kind of use, I shall think myself honour'd: and at the worst, I have this consolation that they pay no postage. Yours as before. S L  ""

  My dear Sir Philada. Novr. 13th. 1781. I was favored with yours of the 5th(1) yesterday. There are some flattering reports here of a meeting between the fleets which brought another drubbing on the English, but the most probable report is that the British fleet have returned to their station at the Hook, judging it unadvisable to hazard a battle after the object of it is removed.  Nothing definitive has taken place on the territorial cessions. That of Virga. will not I believe be accepted with the Conditions annexed to it. The opinion seems to be that an acceptance of the Cession [by] N. York will give Congress a title which will be maintainable against all the other claimants. In this however they will certainly be deceived, and even if it were otherwise it wd. be their true interest as well as conformable to the plan on which the cessions were recommended, to bury all further contentions by covering the territory with the titles of as many of the claimants as possible. We are very anxious to bring the matter to issue that the State may know what course their honor and security require them to take. The present thinness of Congress makes it but too uncertain when we shall be able to accomplish it.(2)  Will not the Assembly pay some handsome compliments to the Marquis for his judicious & zealous services whilst the protection of  NOVEMBER 13, 1781  the Country was entrusted to him? His having baffled and finally reduced to the defensive so powerful an army as we now know he had to contend with, and with so disproportionate a force, would have done honor to the most veteran officer and, added to his other merits and services, constitute a claim on their gratitude which I hope will not be unattended to.  I am Dr. Sir, Yrs. Sincerely, J. Madison Junr.  [P.S.] A series of intercepted letters from Mr. Deane to his correspondents in America have been lately published in New York.(3) The object of all of them, with degrees varying from cautious insinuation to direct advice, is to bring America back to a dependence on Britain modified according to the terms proposed by the Commissioners in 1778. The genuineness of some of these letters is upon good grounds questioned, but most of them contain marks of authenticity which clearly denounce him to be an apostate, and consign his character to the same infamy with that of his friend Arnold. This sentence is delivered here against him with the less hesitation because a prior & indubitable evidence of his degeneracy had been received through another channel. Whether this defection has proceeded, from a mercenary contract with the enemy, from a view of obtaining such an one, or from a chagrin at the obstacl[es] which his Country has by a total prohibition of intercou[rse] with the enemy opposed to the commercial projects he went to Europe to execute is as yet matter of speculation.

  Dear Sir. Philadelphia Novr. 13th. 1781(1) Last Week the Superintendant of Finance sent me a Billet, requesting me to attend a meeting of the Subscribers to the national Bank, for the Purpose of choosing Directors. When met, I found that my Name was set down against your's, Deac[o]n Davis's, Mr. Wendall's, Mr. T. Parson's & Mr. Wetmore's. Altho' I have recd. no Advice, I conclude you intended I should appear in your Behalf. Mr. Morris kindly, & at present I am of Opinion very Judiciously, requested me to become an Adventurer, in Order that I might be qualified to be appointed one of the Directors, there being no Chance otherwise, but to appoint the whole Number of Directors out of the Citizens of Philadelphia. I informed him that I could not Subscribe, not having the Money to Advance; He seemed desirous to remove that Obstacle; He offered to Advance the Money, If I could give him a Draught on Massatts. Where he should have Occasion for the Money. I had but a few Moments to consider of it & subscribed; after which they appointed me one of the Directors.(2) It was not with a View of Gain that I subscribed; but from a Desire to be of some Service to the State; as we are the first commercial State in the Union, If the Plan succeeds, we shall probably be very greatly interested in the Bank. And as the Financier will reside in Philadela. where he must have, in considerable Part, the command of the Taxes, required of the several States, I know of no other Way that we can so easily transmit Money, as in Bank Notes, which are to be receivable in Taxes. It appears to me there are several substantial Reasons, why we should have a Share in the Direction of the Bank; but I need not mention them to you, as they will undoubtedly occur to your Mind. In the Situation I am in, I find myself under a Necessity of giving some Friend in Boston, more trouble than I could wish. I intend giving the Financier a Draught on the Trea- NOVEMBER 13, 1781  surer; & for a very Plain Reason, which is, that I have not drawn upon him, but for Eighty five Specie Dollrs. since I left the State, which is about six Months. But for fear that so large a Draught at once, as four hundred Dollrs. should not be honored; I have to request you, if any Difficulty occurs, to be an Intercessor-& to furnish you with Matter, therefor, shall observe, That if I do not misremember a Resolve of the Court passd sometime last Fall or Winter, limiting the Delegates to Two thousand Dollrs. new Money for their annual Expences; which at one & 7/8 is equal to 1066 2/3 Specie Dollrs.-this is but about half as much as the several Delegates to the southward of this, are allowed for their Expences. However it will support a gentleman in a moderate Way-And I am sensible our State cannot at This Time afford them more. The Governor, by the Way of a Bill upon Mr. Marboy, has furnished me with 133 1/3 Dollrs., which, with the Eighty five, (making 218 1/3) is all I have recd. I have made up the Deficiency out of my own Money, from which I have spent a considerable Sum. If I do not exceed in the Course of the year the Sum allowed by the Resolve of Court, I hope my Draught will not be that extravagant. If the Draught should not be honored by the State, which I can hardly admit, I flatter myself, it will be in your Power, or in the Power of some of your Friends, to take it up; should this be the Case, I will engage to have made a proper transfer of the Stock to such Person when I leave this Place, for I care but little about the probable Benefit of 400 Dollrs. But should be happy to gain some Information, in a direct Chanel, of the Transactions of the Directors; so that I may be able to give some Account thereof, to the Adventurers of our State. The present Directors are appointed for one Year only, and it is proposed, that in the Act of Corporation, there shall be a Rotation of Directors, least undue Influence may keep some Directors in too long against the Interest of the Bank. I must acknowledge I am not very fond of a Rotation, for it seems paradoxical to me, to suppose that in a Case of so much Importance, that the Adventurers in their annual Elections, should conspire against their own Interest. However as all Things are possible I shall not object against it If they are allowed to be eligible for two or three years. I should be happy to have the Corporation such that, if any of our Delegates were Adventurers they might be eligible for two or three Years-as there is no Probability of having any Gentleman from the State residing here, but Delegates. But probably I need not be anxious about this, as many of the Adventurers in Boston & elsewhere within the State may prefer confiding in the mercantile Honor & Wisdom of the Gentlemen of this City rather than any one immediately from our State. I am well pleased with the Gentlemen who are appointed Directors for this year-But as it is proposed that Discount Business be gone into, by the Directors, which will make the Bank more  extensive (or at least the Transactions) it will thereby, in Part become a private Bank, & I apprehend will be greatly to the mercantile Benefit of this City. I am also perswaded that there is a pretty good Prospect of general Advantage provided the Directors are Judicious & cautious in their first Arrangements; & that they do not for the Sake of Gain, incumber their Fund too much with Bank Notes; it will undoubtedly require some Length of Time to establish their Credit. They will be in Circulation immediately. The private Subscriptions do not amount to the Sum proposed-yet there is a Fund to that Amount in Specie, & altho Adventurers may yet come in, if the Stock should rise, they cannot come in upon so advantageous Terms as the original Subscribers. This is a Plan of the Financiers which I very much approve of, as it will prevent the Bank from dwindiling away to nothing; & put the Property into immediate use.  I must beg you to excuse this Letter, & I hope it will give you no Trouble. I have not yet given Mr. Morris the Draught-whenever he calls upon me which I suppose will be in a few Days, I shall deliver it to him. I have wrote the Treasurer,(3) but have not mentioned it, as being otherwise than for necessary Expences because my Draughts have hitherto been very triffling. If you agree with me that Mr. Morris acted liberally as well as Judiciously in desiring to have some one among the Directors, from the Eastward, I doubt not but you will approve of my Conduct in this Instance.  I am, Sir, with Sentiments of the greatest Esteem, your most obedient Servant, Samuel Osgood  ""

They Were to have Robed the Secretary's of Congress Office of the Box of Secret papers, they were Sent on this Business by Arnold, and was to have had 1000 Guineas. Eddison who formaly lived with Colo. J. Johnson was also imployed by Arnold and discoverd the plot. He engaged in NOVEMBER 16, 1781  the Business he says for that purpose And Circumstances induce a belief that it was the Case. He stands fair-and it is not improbable that Somthing will be done for him as reward.(1)  ""

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia, the 17th Novr. 1781  I enclose you the memorial presented by Mr. Adams to their High Mightinesses-the effect it has had, or the reasons for publishing it, we know not.(1)  I expect Britain is by this seriously inclined to make peace, and from her situation will be compelled to make an equitable and honorable one for us, her efforts have been greater this year than ever before, twenty one millions and one third were raised for the service of the present year, Notwithstand which her navy, (the grand bulwark of the Nation,) hath been disgraced in every quarter, and her armies in america and the two Indies shareing the same fate- particularly the boasted conquering one in the former in a most eminent degree. The troops at New York are much dispirited, and it is believed that if the United States would offer a general pardon to the refugees, a large majority would return from the enemy, some of the officers have expressed as much to our officers who have lately left there. New Jersey has this matter under contemplation, and I believe some other States.  Congress have been lately much embarrassed, but they are emergeing very fast, all their departments move now methodically, They have appointed a Superintendant of Finance (Robert Morris) secretary of foreign affairs (Robt. R. Livingston) and Secretary of War Majr. Genl. Lincoln. The abilities of these gentlemen being equal to the importance of their respective offices is productive of the happyest consequences for the United States. The French prove extreme friendly to us, exclusive of the assistance rendered by their fleet, (the importance of which ought to be remembered by the Southern States and greatfully acknowledged) a great part of the promised subsidy or loan, is already arrived in specie, military stors and Cloathing, so that we have a sufficiency of the latter for our army the ensuing year.  The original cover of the enclosed letters from Mr. Whiting, being in my possession broke and damaged, I took the liberty of taking it off.  You will please to make my compliments to Your Lady, Mr. & Mrs. Ellis and believe me to be with sentiments of the highest reguard, Dear Sir, Your humble servt. Benjamin Hawkins  [P.S.] No 1 & 2 of the continuation of the Abbe Raynals Revolution of america, and the remainder of that work I will send you with my next.(2)  I wish you, and some gentleman of abilities equal with yours, would consent to come on and represent our state, you would be NOVEMBER 17, 1781  happy here, as for myself, I am not, being thoroughly convinced, of my want of abilities equal to the trust reposed in me, and I shall return as soon as I can obtain from Congress some Supplies for our state which I am soliciting.

  Sir, Philadelphia Novr. 18th. 1781. This short letter will inform your excellency of my safe arrival here on Friday last. Genl. Varnum & Mr. Mowrey will make you and the Genl. Assembly acquainted with the news and present State of politicks, therefore permit me, Sir, to refer you to them.( 1)  The naked condition of our Treasury when I left the State, would have render'd any application for money fruitless, I therefore came off with the small sum which could be spared from my family, without asking a grant from the General Assembly. That small sum will soon be expended, and unless I am furnished with money from the State I shall be in a miserable situation indeed. Give me leave through your Excellency to intreat the Genl. Assembly to order the Genl. Treasr. to transmit to me as soon as possible two or three hundred dollars; and I could wish that at the same time the Genl. Assembly would empower me to draw on the Genl. Treasurer for a Sum not exceeding, including the Sum which I have already defered may be immediately forwarded to me, eight hundred dollars. I have mentioned a certain sum because I would not chuse, if I thought the Assembly would grant it, and power to draw without limitation. I propose if this liberty should be granted to draw from time to time for small sums as I may want them, and I can find persons who will furnish me with money here to be paid by bills upon the Genl. Treasurer. This mode of supply would save both time & risque, for there is some danger in sending money and opportunities may not offer when the money may be ready and much wanted. Before I shall receive an answer to this letter, and be furnished with the power asked for, some considerable time will have run out, and I am sure my present cash will be exhausted, therefore permit me Sir to urge that the Sum asked for may be forwarded  NOVEMBER 18, 1781  immediately-if that Sum cannot be furnished direct One hundred and fifty dollars to be transmitted as soon as possible.

  Dear Sir Philada. Novr. 18th. 1781. By the conveyance through which you will receive this the Delegates have communicated to the State the proceedings in Congress to which the territorial cessions have given birth.(1) The complexion of them will I suppose be somewhat unexpected, & produce no small irritation. They clearly speak the hostile machinations of some of the States against our territorial claims, & afford suspicions that the predominant temper of Congress may coincide with them. It is proper to recollect however that the report of the Committee having not yet been taken into consideration,(2) no certain inference can be drawn as to its issue, and that the report itself is not founded on the obnoxious doctrine of an inherent right in the U. States to the territory in question, but on the expediency of cloathing them with the title of New York which is supposed to be maintainable against all others. It is proper also to be considered that the proceedings of the Committee which we laboured in vain to arrest, were vindicated not by the pretext of a jurisdiction belonging to Congress in such cases, but alledged to have been made necessary by the conditions annexed to the Cession of Virginia. Although the Cession of Virginia will probably be rejected on the whole, I do not think it probable that all the principles & positions contained in the report of the Committee will be ratified. The Committee was composed of a Member from Maryland, Pennsylvania, N. Jersey, Rhode-Island & N. Hampshire all of which States except the last are systematically & notoriously adverse to the claims of the Western territory & particularly those of Virginia. The opinion of the Committee is therefore no just index of the opinion of Congress, and as it is a rule observed since the Confederation was completed, that seven votes are requisite in every question, & there are seldom more than 7, 8, 9, or 10 States present, even the opinion of a Majority of Congress is a very different thing from a Constitutional vote. I mention these particulars that you may be the better able to counteract any intemperate measures that may be urged in the legislature. I do not hesitate to NOVEMBER 18, 1781  declare my opinion that the State will not only find in the communications we have made to them ample justification for revoking or at least suspending their Act of Cession, and remonstrating against any interference with respect to cases within their jurisdiction, but that they ought in all their provisions for their future security, importance & interest to presume that the present Union will but little survive the present war. I am equally sensible nevertheless of the necessity of great temper & moderation with respect to the first point, and in the last that they ought to be as fully impressed with the necessity of the Union during the war as of its probable dissolution after it. If the State wishes any particular Steps to be pursued by the Delegates, it would be well for particular instructions to that effect to be given. These will not only be a guide to us, but will give greater weight to whatever is urged by us.  I inclose you a paper containing two of the many letters lately published in New York with the subscription of Mr. Deane's name. The genuiness of some of them & particularly that to Mr. Morris is generally doubted. There are some who think the whole of them spurious.(3) However this may be there is through another channel indubitable proof that no injustice is done in ascribing to him the sentiments advanced in these letters. Either from pique, interested projects of trade, or a traitorous correspondence with the Enemy, he has certainly apostatized from his first principles.  Col. Willet has lately defeated & dispersed a party from Canada amounting 6 or 700 few of whom will escape captivity, the sword, or famine in the Wilderness. The action commenced near Johnstown.  The Minister of France has dispatches from [Europe?] by a late arrival which confirm the expedition from Cadiz against Minorca and the actual landing of the troops on the Island.  With great respect & sincere regard I am Dr Sir Yr Obt & humble Servt. J Madison Junr.  ""

The distress which the common enemy have experienced from these combined operations will we presume point out to both nations the utility of similar measures in future, and while on the one hand it prompts your majesty to supply that naval force which the situation of our country renders necessary to offensive operations, it urges on the other the united States to every exertion which their particular interests & their desire of seconding your majestys views can call forth.  It is with peculiar pleasure that the united States continue to number some of your majesty's subjects among their most able, spirited & faithful servants.

Our Labours my Dear sir it is to be hoped are drawing to a period, provided a proper use is made of this winter. Let us not entertain the Sentiment that our late Extraordinary Successes have Superseded the necessity of any further Extraordinary Exertions, as has been too often the Case, but on the Contrary let us Strain every nerve to drive the Enemy from every part of our Country the next Campaign; untill that is done, there Can be but little hopes of peace. While they have Any Military force in the united states and  NOVEMBER 27, 1781  Can preserve a gleam of hope of Conquering or regaining America; no depredations on their Commerce no loss of Dominion in the East or West Indias, will induce them to make peace, because with America reunited to them, they may think they Could Easily regain whatever they may now loose. One more vigorous Campaign might Effect this purpose, would end all our toils, and Secure to us the Blessings of peace And independence, which we have been So long, and So Virtuously Struggling for.  The British fleet as generally believed has left the hook, and gone to the West Indias.

  Dear Sir [November 27, 1781](1) Your favor of the l9th instant (2) came to hand yesterday. On the same evening arrived our illustrious General returning to his position on the North river. We shall probably however have his company here for some days at least, where he will be able to give Congress very seasonable aid in settling the military establishment for the next year, about which there is some diversity of opinion. Whatever the total requisition of men may be on the States, I can not but wish that Virginia may take effectual measures for bringing into the field her proportion of them. One reason for this wish is the calumnies which her enemies ground on her present deficiency, but the principal one is the influence that such an exertion may have in preventing insults & aggressions from whatever quarter they may be mediated, by shewing that we are able to defy them.  The Delegates have lately transmitted to the Govr. for the Assembly all the proceedings which have taken place on the Subject of the territorial Cessions.(3) The tenor of them & the reception given them by the Assembly will I doubt not be communicated to you by some of your Correspondents in it.  There is pretty good reason to believe that a descent on Minorca has actually taken place. It is a little problematical with me whether successes against G. B. in any other quarter except America tend much to hasten a peace. If they increase her general distress they at the same time increase those demands against her which are likely to impede negociations, & her hopes from the sympathy of other powers. They are favorable to us however in making it more the interest of all the belligerent powers to reject the Uti possidetis as the basis of a pacification.  The report of Rodney's capture never deserved the attention it seems which was given to it.  I am Dear Sir Yrs. sincerely, J Madison Junr.  ""

  Sir, Philadelphia, December 3rd. 1781. Since the happy and important event of the reduction of Cornwallis and his army we have nothing materially interesting. Northern operations have been, for a considerable time, and will continue of little importance, as the views of the enemy have been Southwardly; what their next frantic System may be, we must submit to time and observation. It is pretty certain that only a part of the late embarkation from New-York were dis-embarked, and some conjectures are they must be destained for the West Indies, others to Charleston; Should the latter have been their object they must be arrived long before this can reach you. It is to be lamented that the allied operations could not be carried into effect, to the Southward, with that dispatch, we had reason, at one time, to hope.  The re-inforcements Sent on under Major Genl. St. Clair will give Stability to our measures in the Southern quarter. It will afford General Greene a prospect of curtailing the enemies limits to Charleston and the Sea-Islands; and flatter ourselves it will cause Savannah to be evacuated, if not we hope that place will be made exceedingly uneasy to them.  You may in all probability be informed by the Superintendant of Finance that the Quota allotted to Georgia of Eight Millions of Dollars to be raised on the United States for the ensueing Campaign, has been ascertained at twenty four thousand nine hundred and five Dollars. We used every possible means to reduce even that Sum: and upon the close of the estimate Congress were informed that a Tax Bill was not to be expected, as our distress, by means of the ravages of the enemy had effectually precluded every idea of  DECEMBER 3, 1781  Taxation for some time, We therefore hope you will rest easy on this head.(1)  Soon after the new delegation took their Seats in Congress, Major General Howe appeared in consequence of an order of Congress dated the 5th of September last, to answer an enquiry to be held respecting his conduct on the capture of the army under his command at Savannah, and the evacuation of the State soon after. The Steps we have taken in consequence of his arrival, we enclose for your consideration (2) and beg leave to suggest what is already done we conceive to be nearly adequate to the views of the Assembly.  Since the emission of paper money has ceased, but above all since the circulation of it has had a final Check, the principles of economy and that of finance appears the object of States looking forward to the security of their independence and so much of this has been adopted by congress, that there is not a probability of drawing any resources, except what is sent to be immediately under the direction of the commanding officer to be applied to the use of the army. South Carolina is under the same difficulties with our State, in point of State Supplies; and all that has been supplied to the two States for months past, has been three months pay and Subsistence to the officers that are and have been prisoners at Charleston &C.(3) and even this can only carry the idea of locality, as they without doubt belong to the United States; we do not mean to include the idea of Supplies to the delegates of these States, in this observation. On a view of this system you will readily perceive the Situation of affairs here, & make such allowances as the emergencies of the times may require. We sincerely wish that we may soon be reinstated in the full possession of our country, and by Steady and adhereing principles of economy and decorum in our public affairs, there can be no doubt of establishing funds adequate to the Support of our own internal police, and by pursueing our public measures with decision and rectitude, we shall recover the ground we have lost, and soon rise equal to any state in the Union. This is not only known to our friends, but also to our enemies, and causes the latter to contend for the prize-and the idea of the extent & fertility of our country, will scarce give our friends time to reflect or even Suppose we stand in need of any thing. A fund was established some months since to support the delegates of the disabled States, in which were included the three Southern ones;(4) and we are informed the Government of South Carolina is sending Indigo to support their Delegates here, and it appears time, as this fund cannot last long, and we do not think any additional provision will be made-and even Supposing this to be done, in what a situation must we be, to apply for a fund to be established for our own support (when the other States will be independant in point of supplies) this is so repugnant to every prin[ciple] of policy & Goverment, that our necessities must be great   indeed before we can submit to a measure of this kind; and yet in our present situation we do not know how we can do without it.  We expect a quantity of clothing to arrive soon in this city, at which time we are hopeful that Some may be procured under a supply for Colo Jackson's Troops and at the same time, premise, that the capture of Cornwallis and his army may assist in obtaining some arms, after which we are sanguine in our expectations that the funds and resources of the State will prove adequate to our wants.  How much more will it be to our honor, to Support our own internal police from our own funds; by which measure we will in every possible view of political affairs, evince to our friends and our allies, that we are looking forward to, and securing every Pass leading to our Independence; Such conduct will give weight to our councils and Stability to our measures in general.  We beg leave to suggest that paper money (and in particular the old emissions of Congress) can never have any currency, and certain we are that no given sum in it would purchase one pound of Beef or Mutton at market, or any other article to the value of either in this City; and even this is no new matter; it is of many month's standing; and we judge it best that all contracts be in Gold and Silver, to be paid at distant periods, and that no sales be made except it be in Specie as aforesaid; and even then only so far as the pressing and immediate emergencies of the State may require. When Sales are made under our present Situation; it is evident that property can not be disposed of to one fourthe the real value, as if the enemy were out of our country, & She thereby recovered from her present distress.  The arrears due by the State cannot be properly ascertained until we are in full possession of it, and certificates to the different departments must stand and be settled & liquidated hereafter, as State, or as United States-as the Case may be. We beg leave, Sir, through you to offer our hearty congratulations to the Honorable the Assembly, on the Brilliant Success of the combined arms over the enemy at York and Gloucester in Virginia, and also on the return of a new and free-constitutional Assembly,(5) to whom be pleased to make a tender of our respectful compliments, and we have the honor to remain with esteem and respect, Sir, your most Obedient Humble Servants, Edwd.

You have doubtless heard that the Count de Grasse has left the Cheasepeake, that the Northern Troops are returning, and that the French Troops will probably continue in Virginia this Winter.  Genl.

A Committee of Congress are appointed to consider and Report what Military Establishment may be necessary for the next year.  Genl.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia 5th Decr. 1781. I have sent forward your letter to Mr. Whiting which came under cover to me. Genl. Clinton continues very quiet in New York and I believe is content to spend the winter there in peace, their pride is exceedingly hurt by their late disgrace, the officers conscious of having forfeited the very high opinion entertained of them in america and particularly in England, seem to be looking out for objects to cast the blame on, the letter of Lord Cornwallis to General Clinton is a proof of it.  Some late accounts from Europe, represent the British nation to be exceedingly embarrassed by the series of misfortunes attending their navy and armies, this year; when the combined fleet were in the Channel the Nation were so much alarmed for the safety of their fleet, that the Admeral to quiet them, was oblidged to publish they were safe. DECEMBER 5, 1781  The Dutch at last seem determined to act spiritedly, and are making great exertions to repair and Augment their navy, we now expect a loan of money from them, and we have some assurances that our expectations are well founded, I say this because on some former occasions it has been expected from whence [it] was not to be had.  The King of Prussia, tho [not a] Maritime power has acceeded to the armed neutrality and a number of Dutch ships sail under his flag, in consequence thereof.  The Spaniards have landed on Minorca and taken the town by surprise and about 300 prisoners they are in possession of all the Island the Castle excepted, which lays three miles from the town, this enterprise was so well conducted that the inhabitants had not time to move any of their effects into the Castle, it is said that the treasure found here was equal to what was in St. Eustatius.  France continues determined to render us every assistance in her power, and urges us to make every effort to compell Britain to make peace, for she finds that that turbulent impereous power will do nothing but by compulsion, tho I think she must be seriously inclined to peace by this for She must certainly see, that if the War continues one year only, unless some wonderfull enterposition of providence her possessions in the two Indies, America and on the Continent will be divided amongst her enemies-probably Prussia acceeding to the Armed Neutrality is to give her an Oportunity, should she be insulted to seize Hanover.  I have obtained from Congress for our State one thousand stand of arms, in addition to the thousand furnished by the Commander in Chief, to be dilivered immedeately to our [or]der at Richmond with Cartridge boxes, Flints, Cartridges, powder and Musket Ball, in proportion to the muskets,(1) tho I hope by this you do not need them, as I expect the post at Wilmington will be this month reduced or evacuated and the enemy be put up at Charlestown, by a regular force, until we shall be able to reduce them.  I must repeat to you my old request that you would come on to Congress, as soon as the assembly sits, you would be happy here.(2) I shall return shortly, I hope.  Inform Mr. Ellis that the bill he drew on Mr. Ball, in favour of George House for forty dollars has not met that attention due to it, as he has not excepted till now and only on condition that he sells the bill. I told Capt. Ho[use] who give me this information, not to have the Bill protested, that I would pay it, since which I have not heard from him.

  Sir Philadelpha December 6. 1781. We do ourselves the honor to inform your Excellency, that the Minister Plenipotentiary from the Court of France to these United States, has lately communicated to Congress, thro' our Secretary for foreign Affairs, that he had it in command from the Minister of France, to inform Congress, that the King, his Master, was highly pleased with the Confidence, Congress had placed in him, and that the King would pay the same Attention to the interests of the United States, as to that of France; that Congress would have no reason to say that they had misplaced their Trust, that if all was not obtained that the United States had reason to expect, it must be imputed to the unavoidable Events of War, that from late successes and present appearances, the King had no reason to expect he should be under the necessity of making any concessions either on his own part, or that of the United States, that it is his most earnest wish, that every possible Measure should be taken and every exertion made by the United States to be ready for an early and spirited campaign. The reasons are given that make those measures the more necessary but must at present be omitted.(1)  Doctor Franklin, in a letter of a late date,(2) informs Congress, that there is every reason to expect the continuance of the friendship of our great, good and illustrious Ally, the King of France and his Minister the Count de Vergennes. The Doctor speaks of this Nobleman in as high terms as the English Language will admit. He says that the King upon hearing of the Capture of the Transport, the Marquis la Fayette was apprehensive that our Troops would be distressed for want of Cloathing, and had given orders to replace all DECEMBER 6, 1781  the cloathing and other articles that were taken in that transport. The Doctor advises Congress of the absolute necessity of their making every exertion so as to be ready for an early and vigorous campaign, and among other reasons for urging those measures, he says should Great Britain propose a Treaty, much time will be spent in settling the preliminaries, before any progress can be made in negociating; and should any remissness on our part give the Enemy the opportunity of striking some unhappy stroke during that period it may be out of our power to retrieve the loss and by that means frustrate any negociati[ons] taking place or at least turn it greatly to our disadvantage. This is the tenor of the Language from all our Ministers abroad, and all our intelligence across the Water from every quarter so far corroborates as to leave no room to doubt the utility of the Measure. We think it needless to say more on this subject. These are the facts and you Sir must be the best Judge of the abilities of our constituents and the measures that can be adopted with the most probability of Success.  A Gentleman of Character in a letter from Madrid, of a late date,(3) says he thinks nothing will be done by the Court of Spain in setting on foot any negociation, untill they know how the present campaign will end. He further adds, that little or nothing, can be done in the reduction of Minorca, until the Arrival of the intended reinforcements of French and Spanish Troops from Spain, that they were not then embarked. What a pleasing reflection it is to view the glorious success of the combined Arms of France and the United States, and to see that it has already given peace and safety to a very considerable district that had been long harrassed by the Enemy and that it tends still further, not only to humble the pride and power of Great Britain, but may in some considerable degree be the means of setting on foot a negociation, that may terminate in establishing an honorable and lasting peace to the United States.  Congress have received a letter from the Governor of the State of New York, inclosing a number of resolutions of the Senate and Assembly, of that State, declaring their right in and over the territory or tract of land heretofore called, the New Hampshire Grants, the allegiance, that hath been from time to time paid by the people inhabiting those lands, to the said State, also protesting against the Act of Congress that declare the aforesaid Territory to be an independent State by the Name of Vermont and setting forth that the said Acts are contrary to several articles of the Confederation, and further protesting against any measures that have been taken by Congress, or that they shall hereafter take to carry said Acts into execution, and finally instructing their Delegates in Congress to use every means in their power to prevent the same. Congress have not received a single line of intelligence from the state of Vermont since the passing the aforementioned Acts.   An Ordinance has lately passed Congress, for regulating Captors and Captures on the High Seas and condemnation of the same, and, among other things, it is ordained that all British property found within three leagues of any of the Shores of the United States, except it be in French Bottoms or hath been previously captured and condemned, shall be liable to Capture and condemnation after the first day of March next. All Acts and Ordinances heretofore made in any wise touching captures is by said Ordinance repealed and this to take place immediately. You will please to excuse our not being more particular on this Subject as we expect the Ordinance will be immediately transmitted to you by the Secretary of Congress .(4)  It is with pleasure we can inform you, that the stock of Cloathing now on hand is a more ample supply for our Army than we ever have been able to make before at any one time since the commencement of the War. It is sufficient to compleatly clothe every Soldier now in Service exept Blankets, of that Article there is a deficiency but such Measures are taken as we flatter ourselves cannot fail of Success.  A Committee has been appointed to confer with the Commander in chief and Secretary at War on the best measures for arranging and filling up the Army, so as to make it respectable.(5) The Committee have reported, that it is inexpedient to make any alterations in the last arrangement that was made by Congress on the 3d and 21st of October 1780 and that the several States be called upon to fill their Regiments with Recruits to serve for three Years or during the War. It appears probable, Congress will agree to the Report of the Committee, and that requisitions will be sent to the several states accordingly. If this should take place we shall be happy to give you the earliest information. We apprehend you will be a little surprized at the deficiency that will appear to be in our Regiment, when Col. Olneys Returns come to hand. The Colonel is arrived at the Head of Elk with his Regiment after having experienced almost every kind of distress in a long passage by Water from York Town. The Regiment is very sickly, the small Pox has got among the last Recruits, in this case they are not alone many from other Regiments are down with it.  All the Executive Business under Congress, is now in new hands and we hope for the better and have the happiness to think that not only much less money is misapplied, than has been at many former Periods but turned to much more advantage to the Public. The established Character of the Superintendant of Finance, his Abilities, numerous correspondents in different parts of the World and permanent property give great advantages in the execution of the important Trust he is honoured with. The public debts that had accumulated previous to his coming into Office were numerous and  the public Creditors exceeding clamorous, they now think that the debts of the longest standing should be first paid, It appears to be Justice but Policy forbids the Measure, when our very Existence as a People, calls aloud that the wheels for the present Moment be kept in Motion.  Our want of Knowledge of the transaction of the Business under the direction of the Secretary for foreign Affairs and the short time he has acted in his Office will we conceive be a sufficient Apology for our saying no more of him at present than that he is a Gentleman of Property and Abilities and appears attentive to Business.  The Confidence that the Commander in Chief and the Army in General has in the Secretary at War, is such, that when we add his knowledge and experience as an Officer his integrity and attention to business, we cannot but flatter ourselves that the Public will receive essential Benefits from his Appointment. In justice to all the aforementioned Gentlemen we must say that they appear to endeavour as much as possible to curtail all useless expences and to appropriate the public Money to the most advantage. But their success so much depends on the exertion and assistance of the States, that they must fail in a great degree in any attempts they may make to retrieve and organize our public affairs, if they are not properly supported by the several Legislatures in the execution of their great and important Trusts.  Since writing the above,(6) the Report of the Committee respecting the Arrangement of the Army, as mentioned in a preceding paragraph, has been agreed to in Congress without any alteration. The Resolutions will be forwarded to you by the Secretary of Congress by this or next post. We beg leave to refer you to the inclosed News Papers for the little public News there is at this time passing.  We have the Honour to be, with the highest respect, Your Excellencys most obed hble servants, William Ellery  Ezek Cornell ""

  Sir Philadelphia, December 9, 1781.  We do ourselves the pleasure to reply to your letter of yesterday,(1) and are sorry to understand that the operative powers of the Court are impeded for want of evidence in the case of Major General Howe, on the part of the State of Georgia.(2) We are not informed by the Board of War with the time or conveyance of the summonses sent to General Elbert and Colonel Marbury; and it will appear pretty evident to you, that we have no coercive powers to compel evidence to attend. Under a train of circumstances peculiar in themselves, we cannot presume to dictate to the Court; but if difficulties exist, the propriety of a reference to Congress will readily occur. We annex the names of such persons as have occurred to us since the delivery of those to the Board of War, whose evidence we wish to have taken on the trial, in addition to the former. We are, Sir, Your most humble Servants, Edward Telfair,  W. Jones.  Colonel Tenant, Major Lucas, Captain Glascock, Major Porter, and Mr. John Gibbons, all of whom are in this city.  MS not found; reprinted from the Collections of the New-York Historical Society for the Year 1879 (New York: Printed for the Society, 1880), p. 222.  1 See ibid., p. 221.  2 The state of Georgia had long held Maj. Gen. Robert Howe responsible for its rapid submission to British invasion in 1778. Within two weeks of the return of the Georgia delegation to Congress on May 15, 1780 (see these Letters, 12:297n.2), they presented instructions drafted by the state assembly on January 17, 1780, directing them to \""promote a trial\"" of Howe for \""leaving this State at the mercy of the Enemy without any Continental Troops\"" by hastily retreating from Savannah following its capture on December 29, 1778, and withdrawing troops from Sunbury and Augusta. In an accompanying motion the delegates explained that the instructions had not been submitted sooner \""on account of an unavoidable Recess in the Government . . . occasioned by the loss and removal of the Troops.\"" Although there is no mention of the instructions or the motion in the journals, they were apparently referred to a committee, for the motion is endorsed: \""Motion from the Delegates of Georgia to bring Genl Howe to a trial, May 1780, passed committee.\"" Perhaps in view of recent British successes in the remaining southern states, the report was allowed to languish for more than a year until a list of pending reports was introduced in Congress on August 23, 1781. The following day the instructions and motion were referred to a committee chaired by Roger Sherman which reported on September 3. After debating the report on September 5, Congress directed the commander in chief \""to cause an enquiry to be made . . . as soon as circumstances will admit.\"" See JCC,21:900,907, 930, 937-38; PCC, item 19, 3:205-8; and Thomas McKean to Washington, Septem- DECEMBER 9, 1781  ber 7, 1781, note 2. The instructions from the Georgia assembly are in the Washington Papers, DLC.  Following the British defeat at Yorktown, Washington transmitted the papers he had received on the Howe inquiry to Maj. Gen. William Heath, wrote to Howe promising to \""bring this Unhappy Matter to a speedy issue,\"" and, upon his return to Philadelphia ordered a general court martial to convene at the City Tavern on December 7, Major General Steuben presiding. See Washington, Writings (Fitzpatrick), 23:278, 344, 374-75. In the meantime, Howe wrote to Congress on November 8-9 protesting the \""Capital disadvantages\"" he faced in preparing for trial, citing the time elapsed since the event, the loss of relevant papers, and the death and dispersal of fellow officers who could serve as witnesses. He appealed to Congress to order \""the few officers which misfortune and accident have thrown into this city\"" to remain until the proceedings terminated. See PCC, item 160, fols.523-26. The court martial, which met from December 7, 1781, to January 21, 1782, with a recess for Christmas, ultimately found that Howe had taken measures that \""were necessary and military\"" and therefore acquitted him \""with the Highest Honor.\"" Informed of the verdict by Washington on January 23, Congress \""approved and confirmed\"" it the following day. On February 15 Howe appealed to Congress to publish the trial proceedings which, after considerable debate, was agreed to on February 19. See JCC, 21:1110, 22:46, 78-80; PCC, item 152, 10:431-32, item 160, fols. 527-28; Washington, Writings (Fitzpatrick), 23:461-63; Evans, Am.

There is evidence of his obliquity which has for a considerable time been conclusive.  Congress have not resumed their proceedings on the Western business.

  Sir Decr. 13th. 1781(1) I have now to acknowledge the Receipt of several of your Letters concerning the affairs of private Citizens. I have written fully to Doctr. Warren respecting his Accounts.(2) I have given my Sentiments to Mr. Appleton respecting Mr. Proctor's Business. I have convened with the Financier and Comptrollor respecting Mr. Chase's and Mr. Fletcher's and have communicated to the latter Gentleman sundry Remarks & some Papers.(3)  I was perplexed in the Affair of Warren. Your Letter was much the Cause. I thought you had patronized the Presentment of the Accounts here upon Grounds which had not allowed you to consider DECEMBER 13, 1781  enough the implied Stigma upon the State of Massachusetts and the Intimates of our deceased Friend Genl. Warren. I find however such Proofs of the Discountenance which Doctr. Warren has met with that I think myself at Liberty to solicit for him in this Quarter. I cannot say much in Favor of yr. pressing Mr. Willson's Case forward as any Ways singular. He is but one of Thousands, And until the States really furnish Congress with Funds such Applications as his can only give Pain to the Delegates without procuring Relief for the Petitioners. And now, Sir, I wish I was a private Citizen that I might have your Patronage and your Answer to some Points which I am sure I have written upon to you respecting my individual Interest. Is there any Resolve of the Assembly of Massachusetts limiting the Draughts of the Delegates? Or, more materially still, is there any Provision whatever made respecting their Support here? I have been honoured by repeated Elections. Surely our good Friend G- -y (4) was not right when he suspected the old ones were to be starved out that a new Set might take their Places, with honourable Appointments. I have more than once or twice been told by real Friends that I had better return if it was only to settle my Accounts. An[d] one of my Sons has given an Hint which makes me construe the above advice into a Censure upon the Freedom of my Draughts. By every Proof in my Possession I find that I have not exceeded any one of my Colleagues, in equal Times; yet, to all who have settled a considerable Balance has been paid. As to an Adjustment of my Accounts in my Absence one Road is very plain. I have till lately lived with my Colleagues one and another of them. Take the lowest Account of any one of those during equal Periods and decide mine by it, I shall be a gainer, and my Draughts will appear to have been governed by my sheer Necessities. Now that we deal in fixed money the Decission is more simple and limited Permissions to draw may be made with less Implication of Censure than in former Periods. You know how few Things are included in the Term Boarding nowadays for which I pay a Dollr. per Day. I will not presume that my other Expences, chargeable to the public, exceed another Dollar, though it would be more much more if I allowed myself all the Decencies & Conveniencies which the State has warranted and would readily repay. As to my Services I am persuaded that I shall receive a better Reward than some of you who settled under the misapprehensions which took Place in estimating a depreciating Paper. Mr. Gerry & Mr. Partridge were allowed 9/ per Day; is Living cheaper than in 1774? Is Connecticut an extravagant, profuse Government? She gave 18/ from the Beginning of Congress, and for about a Year back has given 24/ per day besides all Expences. I have experienced particular Kindness to myself and Family from the State which employs me. I have therefore only to point out Facts to be relieved   under my present Disgraces. I owe for Board and the Shoes & Stockings upon my Feet with many other Bills to come out of the Pay for my Time & Services. It is 247 days since I settled my Board in which Time I have drawn for 12000 old Dollars which being paid in 300 new purchased in Boston 60 hard.  I have recd. here 133 on Armands Draught.  193 I have drawn for 300 in Augst. which was not honoured in Novr. Thus you see the Balance of my Board, my daily Expences, my decent Cloa[thes] and some Care of a large Fami[ly] in a cold Winter are the Cause of Anxiety upon my Mind at a Time when I assure my public Employment was never more vexatious. The necessity of 7 Voices & 9 in some Cases calls for a full Representation and impartial continental generous Spirits in the Delegations. Alas! alas! When I presented the instructions from the State respecting the Subject of the F___ s(5) I thought very little or no objection would me [be] made, but I was greatly mistaken. The Proceedings here of 1779 respecting that Business are made Air of. But, I will be more particular in Cyphers in my next to you or to Secretary Avery.  I am called upon to Close, yr.

He carries a Letter to Mr. Waugh respecting the sale of one of John Dawsons Negro Men and shall be glad you wod. advise Mr. Waugh whether Tobacco or Cash wod. be most acceptable to you as a reimbursement towards the advances made by Mr. Swan on John Dawsons account, and he will endeavour to procure that which will be most convenient. The Tobaccos due to the Estate this winter will be ordered into your hands for the same account. I received some time ago a certificate from you of 1333 1/3 dols. issued from the loan off ice of the State of Maryland not the continental but State office which not being of the Description I was to receive I think it proper to apprise you of it, least any inconvenience should result from its lying with me. If I have an opportunity I will endeavour to obtain a certificate for the interest due on it, which with the one I have if they will not answer my purpose I shall retain or deliver to your order.(1)  We are in this quarter as free from the irruptions of the Enemy at New York as if we were at peace-no military movements and only now an[d] then a few Thieves who come out to Steal Horses or Cattle and these frequently catched with their booty before they can get back. A packet has lately arrived at N. York which has delayed the sailing of the fleet in which it is said Cornwallis and Arnold go to England. The misfortunes which have attended the Enemy in all parts during the last Campaign afford us some room to hope something may be done this winter towards a peace but I fear nothing final, as Britain will strain every nerve to raise the supplies for another year in hopes something may turn up in her favor in the course of an[othe]r Campaign. Let her course be what it may, ours should be to prosecute the war and being in condition to do so, will be the best and surest means of procuring peace upon good terms and also of hastening that desirable event.

  Sir, Philada. Decr. 17 [i.e. 18].1781(1) Your favour of the 10th to me, and of the l5th to the Delegates enclosing your instruction were recd. yesterday by Mr. Covenhoven. The instructions were laid before Congress, and the matters therein urged are referred to a Committee and will be duly attended to. DECEMBER 17, 1781  Upon receiving the instructions relative to the Islands on the Bay & River Delaware; the applications we were directed to make, we all understood was for a Settlement of boundaries agreable to the Confederation; and being informed by the Delegates of Pennsyla. & Delaware that such an expensive mode of Settlement might be avoided, as their states would gladly come into the measure. This Occasioned our delay at that time, and also my Letter at the first meeting of the Legislature.(2) Hearing nothing from you for some weeks, we determined to proceed on the business, which I took the liberty to inform you of by Letter;(3) but in taking the business up we found ourselves at a loss to discover the real wish & intentions of the Legislature, as the applications directed were different from the mode pointed out in the Confederation for Settling boundaries. This Mr. Houston engaged to inform you of; we never once conceived a thought that you doubted your Right to the Islands Contiguous to our Shore untill meeting with Mr. Trent a few days ago, he informed me of your doubts in that respect, which Are confirmed by your Letter of the 10th.  We (4) shall at all times pay due respect & attention to any instructions we may be charged with, at the same time think it our indespensible duty to advise you of the difficulties that may probably arise in the prosecution. If a Title to the Islands & a line of Jurisdiction is all that the Legislature had in view, they will I presume be Sattisfied by Mr. Covenhoven that the business can only be effected by Joint concurrence of the states concerned without any interference of Congress. It is however Suggested that your Real Designs were to establish a precedent for Congress to dispose of all Unappropriated Crown Lands in the several States. This I cannot believe was had in Contemplation by you, as we had no intimations of it, but whether true or false will be a most effectual barr to our Obtaining any grant, for the following Reasons: Most of the states having within their Claims large quantities of unappropriated Lands, will not agree that Congress shall exercise such a Right unless it be over such Lands as shall be Ceeded; and if our Application should be considered as a Cession of our Claim to the Islands, they will if they do any thing Sell them at full Value, in which we shall by our Application lose what we have a just Right to by the Law of Nations, and Settle no preceedent to our Advantage, which you may be assured will be carefully guarded against. Congress is now Represented by only Nine states, the jealousies that will arise on an Application for a grant will influence most of the states to Oppose it on every political principle-seven States are Necessary to concur in every question of the smallest moment-in all wherein there is any Appropriation Nine states must concur; What chance have we then in the present Case?-none that I can see but the loss of what we  DECEMBER 18, 1781  have an indubitable Right to, and which we have in our power to hold the peaceble possession of.  As the business before Congress will not at present and for some days to come, admit a consideration of this matter, we can readily comply with Mr. Covenhovens desire to let the matter rest for a few days till you can be informed of the above and such other matters relative thereto as he will be able to communicate.  I have the honour to be with all due Respect, Sir, Your Obedt. Humble Servt. Abra. Clark  P.S. I wish this Representation might be communicated to the Council.  ""

  Sir Philadelphia, Decem'r 18th, 1781. We do our selves, the honor to inform your Excellency, that since our last, Congress has received a letter from the Governor, of the State of Vermont; Inclosing a number of Resolves, of a grand committee, of both houses of assembly, and Acts or Laws of Said State; (1) Declaring the Acts of Congress, of August last respecting said state, do not comport with the propositions made to Congress by their Commissioners in July last; That no member of the Legislature, shall on any pretence whatsoever give his Vote, for submiting the determination of their right of Independance, to any power on Earth; That all disputes about Territorial or boundary lines, shall be settled by judicious, unprejudiced persons, to be Mutually agreed upon and chosen by the parties concerned, and that the states Interested shall pledg their faith to each other, to abide the determination of the Commissioners, appointed as aforesaid. That when all disputes, are settled, according to the mode pointed out in the afore mentioned Resolves, And the state is legally admitted into the Union, they will consider themselves bound by acts of Congress.  The Superintendant of Finance has presented to Congress, an Ordinance, for ajust'g and setling, the Accounts of the United states with each Individual state &c. It has been read, and is committed, to a special Committee, they now have it under consideration.(2) We shall only mention some of the principal paragraphs. First, that a member from each state, be chosen to meet in the City of Philadelphia, on the first Monday in May next, then and there, to settle the proportion, that each state shall pay, of all the expence that the United states hath been at, from the commencement of the War, to the first day of January 1782, except the moneys that have or may be funded before that time. Secondly that there be a Commissioner for each State, to be nominated by the superintendant of Finance, and  DECEMBER 18, 1781  approved of by the Legislature of the state, for which he is appointed; Whose duty shall be to settle all accounts between such state and the United States according to the orders he may receive from the Comptroller &c. Thirdly the Act of the 18th March 1780 and all the preceeding and succeeding Resolutions for Money and supplies to be fully complied with; by each State. And where it shall be found on settlement of the Accounts, that any state paid more than such states proportion, in that case such state, shall have a deduction in the next requisition. We flatter our selves you will excuse us for not being so particular on this subject, The ordinance has not passed and probably will under go some Alterations. We only wish this to inform you of what is doing.  We have the honor to be, your Excellencys most obedient Humble Servants, William Ellery  Ezek. Cornell ""

As soon as it has passed the last formality in Congress it will be transmitted by the President.

The Mode for setlling State Accounts is not yet determined upon; it is under the Consideration of a Committee.(4)  An Act ascertaining consular Powers is nearly finished, but can have no operation till it shall be agreed to by France.(5)  A Plan for reducing a number of Officers or rather putting them upon half pay, who are considered as supernumerary especially the General Staff, is in Contemplation, and will probably take Effect.(6)  Our latest Accounts from the Southward are that the Enemy have Abondoned their Post at Willmington and all their out Posts in S Carolina that Genl. Leslie has gone to Charestown, but that he has not carryed any Troops.  I hope that our late Successes nor A Dependence on Others will induce us to relax our military Exertions, As the Experience of Ages must convince us, that an Enemy in every Circumstance is to be  DECEMBER 19, 1781  Vigilantly Watched and Strenously Opposed, and that a Nation who rely upon the support or yeild themselves to the guidance of another are in the utmost Danger.

  Dear Sir Philadelphia Decr. 22d. 1781 I understood, by a Gentleman who arrived here from Boston some months ago, that it was your Design to be at Phila. this Winter; and I hoped, for several reasons that it would be the case; but the season for Journeying being over, I expect you will defer the matter till spring when I may chance to see you at Boston before you set off, as I intend to be there by the first of April.  The States have been very thinly represented during the Summer and fall tho' enough have been here to do some things which I believe you will judge not very honorable or advantageous to the U.S. and here I should be glad to be particular if the conveyance of Letters was not so very precarious. Whither Mr. A (1) will take a part in the Commission I am not informed but fear he will not, as he is not very fond of leading strings. A Letter lately receivd. from Mr. J (2) gives us his Sentiments on the Subject which appear to me rational and independant. I presume that you have seen Genl. Ward since he returned, & must know what I allude to.  Everything which relates to the old money lies dormiant. The Superintendant (on whom much depends in this case) says that he shall insist on the plan of the 18th March, and when the several States have sunk their Quotas of the old money nominally, he shall promote a plan for doing Justice to those States who were early in doing their duty, & tho' I think him to be honest in his intentions, yet it appears to me very uncertain whither he will Affect his purposes.  You have doubtless been informed that Genl Lincoln has accepted the Office of Secretary at War. Congress passed a Resolution Yesterday (3) which put a piece of Business into his hands that will not, I believe, be very agreeable to him. The purport of the Resolution is that the Commander in Chief shall signify to the Secretary at War from time to time the number of Genl. Officers which he Judges necessary to be in & take the field, and the Secretary shall issue his orders to such as he thinks proper, the remainder to be considered as retiring on half pay, Subject however to be called into service when occasion requires. How this measure will suit the Genl Officers is uncertain, tho' I am told there will be no great difficulty about the matter.  I wish you would be so kind as to inform me when you expect to be here, & whether Mr. Adams or either of our Brethren is coming on soon.  I am Sir with great esteem your most obedt. Huml Servt.

As the lost letter went into the post office here & you did not receive [it] from the post in Virga. the delinquency must [have] happened in that line.(2) It is however I believe of little consequence, as I do not recollect that any thing material has been contained in my letters for several weeks, any more than there will be in this in which I have little else to say than to tender you the compliments of the day.

 By an act passed 1 Novr 1781(10) an excise is laid on wine, rum, brandy & teas and on wheel carriages and for the collection thereof one collector is to be annually appointed for each county. By an act passed March 1782(11) persons importing wine, rum, brandy or teas, and all persons distilling spirituous liquors are prohibited from selling the same without permits so to do from the collector of excise or his deputy. By an act passed Novr 1782(12) a new duty or excise was laid on a great number of articles therein specified, both imported and made in the state. No imported goods are to be landed without a permit from the naval officers or in case of no naval officer in the port from the collector of excise in the county, and where there is no naval officer, collector or deputy in the port, from the town clerk or a selectman. No permit for landing to be given by a naval officer till a manifest of the cargo, on oath, is lodged with him. Collectors and naval officers are empowered to seize. The collector of each county is to account with the treasurer of the commonwealth for the money received for duties or penalties & to pay the same into the treasury quarterly. The collectors appointed in the several counties under former acts are to receive & collect the duties mentioned in this act till others are chosen in their room. Suitable persons are to be appointed annually for executing the duties assigned to collectors with such allowances for their services as shall be determined when they shall be appointed. On the 22 March 1783(13) an impost was laid on certain goods, wares and merchandize which was to be collected by the same officers in the  May 19, 1789  same manner and under the same regulations as prescribed in the Act of Novr 1782. A further impost was laid July 1784(14) And in addition to this another act was passed July 1785(15) laying an impost and excise on a great number of enumerated articles, which duties of impost and excise were to be collected by the same persons and in the same manner as prescribed in the acts to which this is an Addition. In July 1784 an Act was passed establishing naval offices in the several towns of Boston, Salem, Marblehead, Newburyport, Gloucester, Ipswich, Beverly, York, Penobscot, Pepperelborough, Falmouth, Booth bay, Goldborough, Machias, Passomoquaddy, Bath, Plymouth, Barnstable, Dartmouth, Dighton, Edgar town & Sherburne in Nantucket.(16) The naval officers are to give bond & be sworn; their duties are to grant registers for and to enter and clear out vessels; to take manifests on oath of cargoes imported or exported & keep records thereof; to grant bills of health to take bonds required; to secure duties on the lading of vessels hovering on the coasts; to make a weekly return to the county collector of the vessels entered or cleared at their offices, with Copies of the manifests of the cargoes; and every six months to render to the secretary of the state a fair transcript of the entries & clearances & manifests of cargoes. And by an Act of the 2d of the same Month they are to receive and account for a duty of tonnage laid for support of light houses.(17) An act of the same month regulates the fees to be received by the naval officers and prescribes the forms or registers, clearances, permits &c. to be used in the Offices.(18) From these acts it appears that the impost and excise are blended & collected by the same officers and that for the collection of them there is a collector for each county in the commonwealth; And that besides the collectors office there is a naval office for entering and clearing Vessels &c. The propriety of keeping up both offices andthe necessity of the naval officer being an Officer of the United States is apparent from these considerations. 1. The naval officer can greatly assist the collector of the duties and furnish the best documents to check the accounts of the collector. 2. He can keep a register of the vessels belonging to Citizens of the United States & enforce the acts of Navigation. 3. He is the proper officer to furnish the papers required by the treaties of Commerce between the United States and foreign nations. ""
