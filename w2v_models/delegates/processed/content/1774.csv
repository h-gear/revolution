0,dg0011,1774,John Adams Diary,"""John Adams' Diary  AUGUST 29, 1774  [August 29-September 5, 1774] 1774 Aug. 29. Monday rode to Trenton upon Delaware River, to break fast. At Williams's the Tavern at Trenton Ferry, We saw four very large black Walnut Trees standing in a Row behind the House.(1) It seems that these Trees are plenty in these Southern Provinces--all the black Walnut Timber which is used by our Cabinet Makers in Boston is brought from the Southern Provinces. This Town of Trenton is a pretty Village--it appears to be the largest Town that we have seen in the Jerseys, larger than Elizabeth Town, Brunswick or Prince town. We then crossed the Ferry over Delaware River to the Province of Pensylvania. We then rode across an Elbow, and came to the Delaware again--a beautifull River navigable up as far as Trenton. The Country on each Side is very level. We arrived at Bristol about Eleven O Clock, a Village on the Delaware, opposite to which is Burlington. The Scenes of Nature are delightfull here. This is 20 Miles from Philadelphia. Here We saw two or 3 Passage Waggons--a Vehicle with four Wheels contrived to carry many Passengers and much Baggage. We then rode to the red Lion and dined. After Dinner We stopped at Frankfort [Frankford] about five Miles out of Town. A Number of Carriages and Gentlemen came out of Phyladelphia to meet us. Mr. Thomas Mifflin, Mr. McKean of the Lower Counties, one of their Delegates, Mr. Rutledge of Carolina, and a Number of Gentlemen from Philadelphia. Mr. Folsom and Mr. Sullivan, the N. Hampshire Delegates. We were introduced to all these Gentlemen and most cordially wellcomed to Philadelphia. We then rode into Town, and dirty, dusty, and fatigued as we were, we could not resist the Importunity, to go to the Tavern, the most genteel one in America. There we were introduced to a Number of other Gentlemen of the City-Dr. Shippen, Dr. Knox, Mr. Smith, and a Multitude of others, and to Mr. Linch and Mr. Gadsden of S. Carolina. Here we had a fresh Welcome to the City of Philadelphia, and after some Time spent in Conversation a curtain was drawn, and in the other Half of the Chamber a Supper appeared as elegant as ever was laid upon a Table. About Eleven o Clock we retired. By a Computation made this Evening by Mr. McKean, there will be at the Congress about 56 Members, twenty two of them Lawyers. Mr. McKean gave me an Account this Evening of the Behaviour of Ruggles at the former Congress 1765. He was treated pretty cavalierly, his Behaviour was very dishonourable. A Gentleman(2) who returned into Town with Mr. Paine and me in our Coach, undertook to caution us against two Gentlemen particu-  larly. One was Dr. Smith the Provost of the Colledge, who is looking up to Government for an American Episcopate and a Pair of lawn Sleeves. Soft, polite, insinuating, adulating, sensible, learned, industrious, indefatigable, he has had Art enough and Refinement upon Art to make Impressions even on Mr. Dickinson and Mr. Reed. 1774. Aug. 30. Tuesday. Walked a little about Town. Visited the Markett, the State house, the Carpenters Hall where the Congress is to Sit,(3) &c.--then call'd at Mr. Mifflins--a grand, spacious, and elegant House. Here We had much Conversation with Mr. Charles Thompson [Thomson], who is it seems about marrying a Lady a Relation of Mr. Dickensons with 5000£. st[erling] . This Charles Thompson is the Sam. Adams of Phyladelphia--the Life of the Cause of Liberty, they say. A Friend Collins came to see us and invited us to dine on Thursday. We returned to our Lodgings and Mr. Lynch, Mr. Gadsden, Mr. Middleton, and young Mr. Rutledge came to visit us. Mr. Linch introduced Mr. Middleton to us. Mr. Middleton was silent and reserved, young Rutledge was high enough. A Promise of the King was mentioned. He started, \""I should have no Regard to his Word. His Promises are not worth any Thing,\"" &c. This is a young, smart, spirited Body. Mr. Blair came to visit US, with another Gentleman. Mr. Smith, an old Gentleman, was introduced to us, by his Son. Another Mr. Smith came in with our Mr. Paine. The Regularity and Elegance of this City are very striking. It is situated upon a Neck of Land, about two Miles wide between the River Delaware and the River Schuilkill. The Streets are all exactly straight and parrallell to the River. Front Street is near the River, then 2 street, 3d, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th. The cross Streets which intersect these are all equally wide, straight and parallell to each other, and are named from forrest and fruit Trees, Pear Street, Apple Street, Walnut street, Chestnut Street, &c. Towards the Evening, Mr. Thomas Smith, son of the old Gentleman who made us a Visit who is a Brother of Mr. Smith the Minister of Casco Bay, and Dr. Shippen and his Brother and Mr. Reed, went with Us to the Hospital. We saw, in the lower Rooms under Ground, the Cells of the Lunaticks, a Number of them, some furious, some merry, some Melancholly, and among the rest John Ingham, whom I once saved at Taunton Court from being whipped and sold for Horse stealing. We then went into the Sick Rooms which are very long, large Walks with rows of Beds on each side, and the lame and sick upon them--a dreadfull Scene of human Wretchedness. The Weakness and Languor, the Distress and Misery, of these Objects is truely a Woefull Sight.  Dr. Shippen then carried Us into his Chamber where he shewed Us a Series of Anatomical Paintings of exquisite Art. Here was a great Variety of Views of the human Body, whole, and in Parts. The Dr. entertained us with a very clear, concise and comprehensive Lecture on all the Parts of the human Frame. This Entertainment charmed me. He first shewed us a Set of Paintings of Bodies entire and alive--then of others with the Skin taken off, then with the first coat of Muscles taken off, then with the second, then with all--the bare bones. Then he shewed Us paintings of the Insides of a Man, seen before, all the Muscles of the Belly being taken off. The Heart, Lungs, Stomach, Gutts. 1774 Aug. 31. Wednesday. Breakfasted at Mr. Bayards of Philadelphia, with Mr. Sprout a presbyterian Minister. Made a Visit to Governor Ward of Rhode Island at his Lodgings. There We were introduced to several Gentlemen. Mr. Dickenson, the Farmer of Pensylvania, came to Mr. Wards Lodgings to see us, in his Coach and four beautifull Horses. He was introduced to Us, and very politely said he was exceedingly glad to have the Pleasure of seeing these Gentlemen, made some Enquiry after the health of his Brother and Sister, who are now in Boston. Gave us some Account of his late ill Health and his present Gout. This was the first Time of his getting out. Mr. Dickenson has been Subject to Hectic Complaints. He is a Shadow--tall, but slender as a Reed--pale as ashes. One would think at first Sight that he could not live a Month. Yet upon a more attentive inspection, he looks as if the Springs of Life were strong enough to last many Years. We dined with Mr. Lynch, his Lady and Daughter at their Lodgings, Mrs. McKenzies. And a very agreable Dinner and Afternoon we had notwithstanding the violent Heat. We were all vastly pleased Mr. Lynch. He is a solid, firm, judicious Man. He told us that Coll. Washington made the most eloquent Speech at the Virginia Convention that ever was made. Says he, \""I will raise 1000 Men, subsist them at my own Expence and march my self at their head for the Relief of Boston.\""(4) He entertained us with the Scandalous History of Sir Egerton Leigh the Story of his Wifes Sister, and of his Dodging his Uncle, the story the Girl swore to before the Lord Mayor, and all that. There is not says Lynch a greater Rascall among all the Kings Friends. He has great Merit, in this Reign. Mr. Lynch says they shall export this Year 12,000 Wt. of Indigo and 150,000 tierces of Rice from S. Carolina. About 300 Ships are employed. Mrs. Lynch enquired kindly after Mrs. Adams's Health, and Mrs. Smith and family and Mr. Boylstone And Mrs. and Mr. Gill &c. AUGUST 29 1774  1774 Septr. 1. Thursday. This Day, We breakfasted at Mr. Mifflins, Mr. C. Thompson came in, and soon after Dr. Smith. The fa mous Dr. Smith, the Provost of the Colledge. He appears a plain Man--tall, and rather Aukward--there is an Appearance of Art. We then went to return Visits to the Gentlemen who had visited us. We visited a Mr. Cadwallader a Gentleman of large Fortune, a grand and elegant House And Furniture. We then visited Mr. Powell, another splendid Seat. We then visited the Gentlemen from S. Carolina and about twelve were introduced to Mr. Galloway, the Speaker of the House in Pensylvania. He looks like Ben. Davis the Sandimanian . We dined at Friend Collins's--Stephen Collins's--with Govr. Hopkins, Govr. Ward, Mr. Galloway, Mr. Rhoades, &c. In the Evening all the Gentlemen of the Congress who were arrived in Town, met at Smiths the new City Tavern and spent the Evening together. 25 Members were come. Virginia, N. Carolina, Maryland, and the City of N. York were not arrived. Mr. William Livingston from the Jerseys, lately of New York, was there. He is a plain Man, tall, black, wears his Hair--nothing elegant or genteel about him. They say he is no public Speaker, but very sensible, and learned, and a ready Writer. Mr. Rutledge the Elder, was there, but his Appearance is not very promising. There is no Keenness in his Eye. No Depth in his Countenance. Nothing of the profound, sagacious, brilliant, or sparkling in his first Appearance. Yesterday We removed our Lodgings to the House of Miss Jane Port, in Arch Street, about half Way between Front Street and Second Street. I find that there is a Tribe of People here, exactly like the Tribe in the Massachusetts, of Hutchinsonian Addressers. There is indeed a Sett in every Colony. We have seen the Revolutions of their Senti- ments. Their Opinions have undergone as many Changes as the Moon. At the Time of the Stamp Act, and just before it, they professed to be against the Parliamentary Claim of Right to tax Americans, to be Friends to our Constitutions, our Charter &c. Bernard was privately, secretly endeavouring to procure an Alteration of our Charter. But he concealed his Designs untill his Letters were detected. Hutchinson professed to be a stanch Friend to Liberty, and to our Charter, untill his Letters were detected--a great Number of good People thought him a good Man, and a Sincere Friend to the Congregational Interest in Religion and to our Charter Priviledges. They went on with this machiavilian Dissimulation, untill those Letters were detected--after that they waited untill the Boston Port Bill was passed, and then, thinking the People must submit immediately and that Lord North would carry his whole System triumphantly,  they threw off the Mask. Dr. Smith, Mr. Galloway, Mr. Vaughan and others in this Town, are now just where the Hutchinsonian Faction were in the Year 1764 [1765], when We were endeavouring to obtain a repeal of the Stamp Act. 1774. Fryday. Septr. 2. Dined at Mr. Thom. Mifflins with Mr. Lynch, Mr.Middleton, and the two Rutledges with their Ladies. The two Rutledges are good Lawyers. Govr. Hopkins and Govr. Ward were in Company. Mr. Lynch gave us a Sentiment \""The brave Dantzickels, who declare they will be free in the face of the greatest Monarch in Europe.\"" We were very sociable, and happy. After Coffee We went to the Tavern, where we were introduced to Peyton Randolph Esqr., Speaker of Virginia, Coll. Harrison, Richard Henry Lee Esq., and Coll. Bland. Randolph is a large, well looking Man. Lee( is a tall, spare Man. Bland is a learned, bookish Man. These Gentlemen from Virginia appear to be the most spirited and consistent of any. Harrison said he would have come on foot rather than not come. Bland said he would have gone, upon this Occasion, if it had been to Jericho. 1774. Saturday. Septr. 3. Breakfasted at Dr. Shippens. Dr. Witherspoon was there. Coll. R. H. Lee lodges there. He is a masterly Man. This Mr. Lee is a Brother of the Sherriff of London,(5) and of Dr.Arthur Lee, and of Mrs. Shippen. They are all sensible, and deep thinkers. Lee is for making the Repeal of every Revenue Law, the Boston Port Bill the Bill for altering the Massachusetts Constitution, and the Quebec Bill, and the Removal of all the Troops, the End of the Congress, and an Abstinence from all Dutied Articles the Means--Rum, Mollosses, Sugar, Tea, Wine, Fruits, &c. He is absolutely certain, that the same Ship which carries home the Resolution will bring back the Redress. If we were to suppose that any Time would intervene, he should be for Exceptions. He thinks We should inform his Majesty, that We never can be happy, while the Lords Bute, Mansfield and North are his Confidents and Councillors. He took his Pen and attempted a Calculation of the Numbers of people represented by the Congress which he made about 2200000, and of the Revenue now actually raised which he made 80,000£ st. He would not allow Ld. North to have great Abilities. He had seen symptoms of them. His whole Administration had been blunder. He said the Opposition had been so feeble and incompetent hitherto that it was Time to make vigorous Exertions. Mrs. Shippen is a religious and a reasoning Lady. She said she had often thought, that the People of Boston could not have behaved through their Tryals, with so much Prudence and firmness at the  same Time, if they had not been influenced by a Superiour Power. Mr.Lee think's that to strike at the Navigation Acts would unite every Man in Britain against us, because the Kingdom could not exist without them, and the Advantages they derive from these Regulations and Restrictions of our Trade, are an ample Compensation for all the Protection they have afforded us, or will afford us. Dr. Witherspoon enters with great Spirit into the American Cause. He seems as hearty a Friend as any of the Natives--an animated Son of Liberty. This Forenoon, Mr. Caesar Rodney, of the lower Counties on Delaware River, two Mr. Tilghmans from Maryland, were introduced to us. We went with Mr. Wm. Barrell to his Store and drank Punch and eat dryed smoaked Sprats with him, read the Papers and our Letters from Boston. Dined with Mr. Joseph Reed the Lawyer, with Mrs. Deberdt and Mrs. Reed, Mr. Willing, Mr. Thom. Smith, Mr. De hart, and &c. Spent the Evening at Mr. Mifflins with Lee and Harrison from Virginia, the two Rutledges, Dr. Witherspoon, Dr. Shippen, Dr. Steptoe, and another Gentleman. An elegant Supper, and We drank Sentiments till 11 O Clock. Lee and Harrison were very high. Lee had dined with Mr. Dickenson, and drank Burgundy the whole Afternoon. Harrison gave us for a Sentiment \""a constitutional Death to the Lords Bute, Mansfield and North.\"" Paine gave us \""May the Collision of british Flint and American Steel, produce that Spark of Liberty which shall illumine the latest Posterity.\"" Wisdom to Britain and Firmness to the Colonies, may Britain be wise and America free. The Friends of America throughout the World. Union of the Colonies. Unanimity to the Congress. May the Result of the Congress, answer the Expectations of the People. Union of Britain and the Colonies, on a Constitutional Foundation--and many other such Toasts. Young Rutledge told me, he studied 3 Years at the Temple. He thinks this a great Distinction. Says he took a Volume of Notes, which J. Quincy transcribed. Says that young Gentlemen ought to travel early, because that freedom and Ease of Behaviour, which is so necessary, cannot be acquired but in early Life. This Rutledge is young--sprightly but not deep. He has the most indistinct, inarticulate Way of Speaking. Speaks through his nose--a wretched Speaker in Conversation. How he will shine in public I dont yet know. He seems good natured, tho conceited. His Lady is with him in bad Health. His Brother still maintains the Air of Reserve, Design and cunning--like Duane, and Galloway, and Bob Auchmuty. Caesar Rodney is the oddest looking Man in the World. He is tall   --thin and slender as a Reed--pale--his Face is not bigger than a large Apple. Yet there is Sense and Fire, Spirit, Wit and Humour in his Countenance. He made himself very merry with Ruggles and his pretended Scruples and Timidities, at the last Congress. Mr. Reed told US, at dinner, that he never saw greater Joy, than he saw in London when the News arrived that the Nonimportation agreement was broke. They were universally shaking Hands and Congratulating each other. He says that George Haley is the worst Enemy to America that he knew there--swore to him that he would stand by Government in all its Measures, and was allways censuring and cursing America. 1774. Septr. 4. Sunday. Went to the Presbyterian Meeting and heard Mr.Sprout in the forenoon. He uses no Notes--dont appear to have any. Opens his Bible and talks away. Not a very numerous, nor very polite Assembly. Dined at our Lodgings at Mrs. Yards, with Major De boor a French Gentleman, a Soldier, Mr. Webb, and another. Went in the Afternoon to Christ Church, and heard Mr. Coombs. This is a more noble Building, and a genteeler Congregation. The Organ and a new Choir of Singers, were very musical. Mr. Coombs is celebrated here as a fine Speaker. He is sprightly, has a great deal of Action, speaks distinctly. But I confess, I am not charmed with his oratory. His Style was indifferent, his Method, confused. In one Word, his Composition was vastly inferiour to the ordinary Sermons of our How, Hunt, Chauncy, Cooper, Elliot, and even Stillman. Mr. Mifflin spent the Sunday Evening with Us, at our Lodgings. 1774. .Septr. 5. Monday. At Ten, The Delegates all met at the City Tavern,(6) and walked to the Carpenters Hall, where they took a View of the Room, and of the Chamber where is an excellent Library. There is also a long, Entry, where Gentlemen may walk, and a convenient Chamber opposite to the Library. The General Cry was, that this was a good Room, and the Question was put, whether We were satisfyed with this Room, and it passed in the Affirmative. A very few were for the Negative and they were chiefly from Pensylvania and New York.(7) Then Mr. Lynch arose, and said there was a Gentleman present who had presided with great Dignity over a very respectable Society, greatly to the Advantage of America, and he therefore proposed that the Hon. Peytoun Randolph Esqr., one of the Delegates from Virginia, and the late Speaker of their House of Burgesses, should be appointed Chairman and he doubted not it would be unanimous. The Question was put and he was unanimously chosen. Mr. Randolph then took the Chair, and the Commissions of the Delegates were all produced and read.  Then Mr. Lynch proposed that Mr. Charles Thompson a Gentleman of Family, Fortune and Character in this City should be appointed Secretary, which was accordingly done without opposition, tho Mr. Duane and Mr. Jay discovered at first an Inclination to seek further.(8) Mr. Duane then moved that a Committee should be appointed, to prepare Regulations for this Congress. Several Gentlemen objected. I then arose and asked Leave of the President to request of the Gentleman from New York, an Explanation, and that he would point out some particularly the Method of voting - whether it should be by Colonies, or by the Poll, or by Interests. Mr. Henry then arose, and said this was the first general Congress which had ever happened--that no former Congress could be a Precedent--that We should have occasion for more general Congresses, and therefore that a precedent ought to be established now. That it would be great Injustice, if a little Colony should have the same Weight in the Councils of America, as a great one, and therefore he was for a Committee. Major Sullivan observed that a little Colony had its All at Stake as well as a great one. This is a question of great Importance. If We vote by Colonies, this Method will be liable to great Inequality and Injustice, for 5 small Colonies, with 100,000 People in each may outvote 4 large ones, each of which has 500,000 Inhabitants. If We vote by the Poll, some Colonies have more than their Proportion of Members, and others have less. If We vote by Interests, it will be attended with insuperable Difficulties, to ascertain the true Importance of each Colony. Is the Weight of a Colony to be ascertained by the Number of Inhabitants merely--or by the Amount of their Trade, the Quantity of their Exports and Imports, or by any compound Ratio of both. This will lead us into such a Field of Controversy as will greatly perplex us. Besides I question whether it is possible to ascertain, at this Time, the Numbers of our People or the Value of our Trade. It will not do in such a Case, to take each other's Words. It ought to be ascertained by authentic Evidence, from Records. (9) ""

3,dg0014,1774,Silas Deane to Elizabeth Deane,"""Silas Deane to Elizabeth Deane   [August 31-September 5, 1774] [August 31] I got up wash'd my Feet in hot Water, & without eating a Mouthful set out my Journey. This [Trenton] is the prettiest Town I have seen in the Jersies, is on the Banks of the Delaware River, which is here shaal, & rapid over Rocks & Falls so that it has no benefit from Navigation, but I think it is nearly as large a Town as Wethersfield. I have now got through the Jersies, & through This Sheet of paper. Adieu. I have omitted one Ferry which was the first we pass'd but it was a meer Trifle, as was the Next, beyond Delaware, called Shammenoy, over a River discharging into The Delaware. The Weather extreme hot, The Roads sandy, and my illness together allmost sunk Me. The Country has nothing lively, or agreeable, one plain, Mudd Houses covered with Straw, save here, & there an elegant building but the AUGUST 31, 1774  latter are Scarce. We rode Ten Miles To Bristol, a Village on the banks of the Delaware most delightfully situated, having the River close by it, which is thus farr Navigable for large Vessels, Though none were here, and Burlington the capital of the Jersies, on the opposite Shore, to the South of it, which appeared at the distance of about Three Miles down the River, very pretty, but as To Bristol, there are not so many buildings as in Rockyhill nor of so good appearance though this is within Seventeen Miles of Philadelphia. Here We baited, and then push'd forward in extreme heat, To a Tavern within Six Miles of Philadelphia, yet in the whole of this Stage there was neither Village, or Country Seat, nor any thing by which a Stranger would conclude himself near a Capital Trading City. The Tavern appeared tolerable, had it been less so We must have put up, but To our surprize here was no Fruit, bad Rum, and nothing of the Meat kind but Salt pork. I had now been destitute of Food &c Twenty four Hours & consequently kept a severe though involuntary Fast on the Day you Fasted & prayed for Us in Connecticut. I called for Bread Cheese, & Porter. The latter they had none of, but of the Former, tho. their Cheese was both New, & bad I swallowed a few Mouthfuls, & having excellent bottle Cyder, I mix'd it with water and it prov'd a Cordial to me. Saml Webb knock'd over Three or Four Chickens, & roasted them, but I could not Taste them. We set out from thence for this City at Five oClock & arrived at Six. Mr. Dickinson, the Pennsylvania Farmer has a pretty Seat about Two Miles out of Town on the Road, which to my surprize, was the only one I saw deserving the Name. Not a Garden, nor the appearance of one, in the Neighborhood of this City, equall to Ours. This gave Me a poor Opinion of their Vegetable Market. Wheat Fields croud into The very Squares of the City, but as to Grass, & verdant Meadows there is more between Wethersfield, & Hartford than in Sixty Miles on the Road We came. The City standing on a plain, and but few Steeples You see Nothing of it untill You are in the Midst of it. We drove up to a Noted Tavern one Mr. Biddles, & alighted. I called for Coffee, & meeting with some former acquaintance my Spirits recruited. Mr. Galloway very politely calld on Us, as did Dr. Smith. Fortunately Lodgings had been reserved for Col. Dyer, & Docr. Johnson.(1) I took the Bed reserved for the latter and am well provided for at a Widow Lady's one Mrs. House. Mr. Gadsden, & Son from Charlestown S. Carolina, S. Webb, young Mr. Dyer, Mr. Arnold & self are the Lodgers, thus I have given You my Journal down to Wednesday Evening. Leml. Deming is here as is Thos. Willson. [September 1] Thursday. Col. Floyd, & my Brother arrived. The City is full of People from abroad, & all the Lodgings in Town full, or engaged. This Day is so excessive that I set in my Gown and Write for I dare not venture out much thro' Fear of a Return of my AUGUST 31, 1974  disorder from which Thank God I am now perfectly well. The Delegates from Virginia, Maryland, the Lower Counties, & New York, are not arrived. We spent this Day in visiting Those that are in Town, & find them in high Spirits particularly the Gentlemen from the Jersies, and South Carolina. In the Evening We met to the Number of about Thirty drank a Dish of Coffee together talked over a few preliminaries, & agreed to wait for the Gentlemen not arrived untill Monday Next, before We proceeded to Business. [September 2] This Day Therefore, Friday I mean to ramble over the City, & make my Observations. Tomorrow am invited by Docr. Smith who is vastly sociable, (or rather aims at it) to see the College & Curiosities of the City & in the After Noon I design for German Town which They tell Me is about Six Miles off where I shall remember my Stockings. I find but Two Things disagreeable as yet-- the extreme heat in this City, and a Scarcity of a Fruit, vegetable and Fish Market. The aspect of the Inhabitants, bespeak them, affable & Clever, and the Freind or Quaker habit was always agreeable To me. They have a strong partiality in favor of this City, & think nothing is equall to it in America, but I am not yet prepared to subscribe to their Opinion. I traversed their Market this Morning. Their Mutton looks the best I ever saw. Their Soil is fit for this, being dry & sandy but though their Meat is Neatly dress'd I saw no Connecticut Beef, and could honestly prefer Hookers Cart for that Article to any thing I saw here. There was not a Fowl, nor a Fish in the Whole market. Water Melons look'd tolerable, & was the only Fruit worth buying. There were a few Miserable Pears, & peaches, & plumbs--and as to Vegetables, & Roots, Potatoes, Green Corn and Cabbage comprized the Whole in a Manner, and these brought, in a very indifferent Order. You will begin to think Me, as guilty of partiality as the Philadelphians are said to be. They who think nothing is right but what is in this City, & province think so too. Nay, they look on Me mad when I tell them, that I have seen more good pasture, Clover, Meadow, Oxen, & Cows, in a Circle of Three Miles in Connecticut, than is here to be met with in Thirty, but it is True, & every New England Man in the Company tells them the same. But Tomorrow is their Market Day when We are to see great Things, indeed I begin to suspect we have travelled over the poorest part of their Country. The People are really extreme civil, & vastly industrious, in both these I think they must take rank. [September 3] I find I must page my Lettr. or you will never be able to take the Course of it. It is Now Saturday Morning. Yesterday arrived Capt. Jera. Wadsworth in good Health. In the After Noon came in the Virginia, & Maryland Delegates, & part of those from New York so that We are almost compleat. The Virginia, & indeed all the Southern Delegates, appear like men of importance. We wait-  Picture of Philadelphia Market  ed on, and were introduced to them, in the Evening. They are sociable, sensible, & spirited Men, & the short Oppy. I had of attending to their Conversation, gives Me, the highest Idea, of their principles, & Character. I attended the Market, this Morning, & have no reason to alter my Opinion in favor of the Supplies of this City to those at New York. As I said before their Meat is brought in the Neatest order, & appearance, & their Mutton exceeds, but in the Whole market, was Nothing of the Fish kind, and I scarcely saw any Fowls of any kind worth Naming. Fruit of but few kinds & those very inferior, Water melons excepted, which you will think ought to be good, when I tell you, I saw them sold for Two shillings each--and among their Roots & Vegetables I saw none of the first Quality, and none at all, of several that We value. I saw no Celery, not a Root, no kind of Sallads. one Basket of Endive excepted, No Beans but what were fit to Shell, & the Cucumbers offered for Sale, older than ever We eat them. The only Vegetables, or Roots worth Noticing, are Cabbages & Potatoes good, Turnips, Carrotts, & radishes, as Tough as a dry sandy soil will make them, but the Red Bates are good. The whole of their Market is in one Street, and is Near Twelve Hundred Feet in Length, the Street is as Wide As the Broad Street or Way in New York, & is as full as you can conceive of People for about Four Hours. They expose Horses, Cattle, & Sheep, Earthen Ware, Stockings, &c, &c, in the Market with other Things so that they really have an Assortment, but every thing without exception is dearer than at New York, Common price of Butter, 16d. per lb. Their Dry Goods, near as I can judge of them, are sold at the same in Philadelphia, as at New York only with the Addition of the odds of the Currency. They have the finest Team Horses I ever saw, there are Teams here which could not be bought for Two Hundred pounds, but I was deceived, as to the neatness, or cheapness of their Carriages. I went this Day to a Noted Coachmaker, & view'd his Work and Asked his prices. A Sulky Thirty four pounds without a Top--a fall back Carriage like mine, fitted for but one Horse, Sixty pounds--and he asked Me Five pounds to New paint & gild mine, for which Reason I shall bring it back in Statu Quo, as my Money will hardly hold out at such a Rate. I have just returned from viewing the College, & Schools & their Furniture. They are clever, & Docr. Smith was very polite in waiting on Us, from Connecticut. On my Return, met with Your Father, Mr. J. Webb, & Sally's Letters, for which I thank them jointly, & severally and as this may be a kind of Family Letter as I shall keep writing occasionally Untill Next Monday it must Answer instead of writing to them individually. I ad vise J. Webb To make the insurance on the Briga., at least, and Cover his as well as my Interest. I rejoice at Your better Health may it still be mended, & fully restored by the Time of my Return, of which  I dare not as yet say one Word, or even think. Inform my Freinds that We are in high Spirits, if it is possible to be really so, where the Eyes of Millions are upon Us, and who consider themselves & their posterity interested in Our Conduct--but the prospect of Unanimity among Ourselves, & of support from Our Countrymen, greatly serve to animate Us, in the arduous task before Us, which is as arduous, & of as great Consequence, as ever Men undertook, & engaged in. This City, & province I have hopes will be firm & resolute though there are not wanting Enemies to the general Cause, & who aided by party are restless in their Endeavors to defeat, or retard Our proceedings. The City have offered Us the Carpenters Hall, so called, to Meet in, & Mr. Galloway offers the State House, & insists on Our meeting there, which he says, he has a right To offer, as Speaker of that House. The last is evidently the best place, but as he offers, the other party oppose. This will be determined on Monday when I shall add the intermediate Occurrences & forward my Letter. I spend the remainder of the Day out of Town. [September 4] Sunday Morning. We had a pleasant ride about Six Miles N. West from the City to the Falls of the Schuylkill River, which is a pretty romantic place, and there are Seven or Eight pretty Seats on the Road some of them but just begun, and none so com pleated as to be brought into Comparison, with Those near New York. Here We met with Docr. Smith again who You will begin by this Time to think is every where, and indeed I think him a most extraordinary compound. Wm. Hubbard, Docr. Turner, Jera. Wads worth, B. Deane, Col. Dyer & myself from Connecticut, Wm. Livingston, Mr. Jay, Mr. Crane, & Col. Floyd from N York and The Jersies, with Mr. Patterson the Collector were present. In Conversation last Evening at the Coffee House with Gentlemen of the first Character in this province, & of Mr Ingersolls acquaintance I find his Con duct very much condemned in this City even by Prerogative Men themselves, or those who might be stiled such.(2) Waiting for my Bar ber I have wrote Thus farr--will only add that Jas. Rivington's paper was Yesterday, agreed to be stopp'd by a great Number of the Gentlemen of this City, & a Subscription come into which will doubtless be Universal. Tell Jos. Webb to promote the same, throughout Connecticut, and to put it forward. I have wrote to the Committee of Correspondence at Hartford the inclosed Letter which I desire him to read, then Copy, & deliver and I wish him to write to Isaac Beers & others at N Haven on The same subject, as I think We ought to unite, in punishing so great a Scoundrel as he appears to be. We set out this morning for Meeting, but Col. Dyer who is one of the worst Men in the World at recollecting Streets, distances, or Stages instead of leading towards Mr. Sprouts Meeting (where, more out of Complaisance to Our Countryman, than from a belief that We  should meet with the best Sermon, We determined to pay Our first Devotions) he led the right Contrary way. Passing Two or three Streets he began to suspect his Error, but on inquiring for Mr. Sprouts, the honest Man asked, if it were The Presbyterian, & then told Us we were right. On This, on We went, Two or three Streets more untill inquiry was in vain, for We had got beyond the Knowledge either of Mr. Sprout, or his Meeting. The Col. fretted, & I laugh'd at him though vexed enough I confess, to find Ourselves thus foolishly swamp'd, when had we accompanied Our Fellow Lodgers, We might have gone to hear either Mr. DeJay [Duchè], or Mr. Coombs, both eminent Men. At length coming to the South West Extremity of the City I proposed to the Col. that We would get a Cryer to look Out Our Meeting for Us, or else go forward to The Bettering House, then in View, or fall into the Church before Us, which from the appearance of the People entering I judged to be high Dutch, & of course could expect Nothing but to be diverted with something New in a strange Language. In We went, The House was unfinished and the People appeared poor, but they civilly shewed Us to a Seat, when to Our agreeable disappointment We were entertained by as agreeable, instructive, & elegantly pathetic a preacher as I have almost ever heard in my Life. He gave Us a discourse of about 50 Minutes without Notes, yet extremely correct, & in a fine Stile. Perhaps the accidental falling upon him, & his being a Warm Son of liberty both in prayer, & Sermon prejudiced Us in his favor, but I do not expect to hear a better Sermon Soon. It seems they are a set of honest plain Dissenters, who to the Shame of the other dissenting Congregations, & their Clergy have rather been despised and persecuted because they insisted on the right of choosing their own Minister, & chose this Gentleman from a distance. Neither of which Circumstances, prejudiced Me against Them, & I design to hear him again, before I leave the City. This Afternoon We found Mr. Sprouts Meeting, and heard old President Witherspoon. The Evening spent at Mr. Thos. Wharton's who was extremely civil, & complaisant and insisted on Our using his Horses & Carriage while in Town, or rather his Convenience, which is the Name of a Freinds or Quaker's Coach. This he was the more urgent in as he was he said Determined to convince Me before I left the City that they had Lands superior to Ours. Monday Septemr. 5th. The Congress formed, by choosing The Honl. P. Randolph Esqr. of Virginia President, & Charles Thompson, Esqr of this City Secretary, & fix'd on Carpenters Hall for the place To meet in. This proceeding, is highly agreeable to the Mechanics, & Citizens in general, but mortifying to the last Degree To Mr. Galloway and his Party, Thompson being his Sworn opposite You may say, & by his means, prevented being one of the Congress for this province. It was a matter of dispute whither We should  Portrait of Peyton Randolph  Portrait of Charles Thomson SEPTEMBER 3, 1774  choose a Secretary out of the Members, & I doubted in my own mind the propriety, but did not oppose it, as by opposing I most probably should have had the Task myself which is Too Burthensome to one who wants all spare hours for relaxation. The Day untill Three, was spent in reading Our Certificates, and adjusting some formalities, after which Adjourned untill Ten Next Morning. I dined in Company, with a Number of New England Gentlemen, at one Mr Marshall's. I will not call him a Quaker, but a Freind, which is the true and proper Characteristic of the Man. In short by seeing, and dealing much in the World, & among the polite, with a Native stock of good Sense, & freed by profession, from the incumbrances of Formality, & compli- ment, he appears the easiest, & truly politest of Men without, a single Bow or congee. I really enjoyed myself at a plentiful, & elegant Table, but the best part of the Entertainment was the pleasure I received from the openess & simplicity of behavior in the Man, and his Wife. When James the second try'd to convert Col. Kirk to the Roman Catholic Faith, this rough, & bloody Soldier told him, he would do anything for him but change his Religion, and that he determined against, but should he resolve otherways he was preingaged, having promised the Emperor of Morocco when in his service, that if ever he altered, he would Turn Turk. I think of this, & have almost resolved if I alter To Turn Quaker. I designed this Afternoon to have rode out, but was prevented by Company and spent the Evening with the Members of the Congress from different Colonies. Our President, seems designed by Nature, for the Business; of an affable, open, & majestic deportment, large in size, though not out of Proportion, he commands respect, & Esteem, by his very aspect, independent of the high Character he sustains. I must begin another Sheet Tomorrow. Adieu.(3) ""

4,dg0015,1774,Joseph Galloway to William Franklin,"""Joseph Galloway to William Franklin   Saturday Septr. 3d. 1774 I am just returned from Philadelphia, where I have been to wait SEPTEMBER 3, 1774  on, and endeavour to find out the Temper of the Delegates. Near two Thirds of them are arrived, and I conclude all will be ready to proceed on Business on Monday. I have not had any great Opportunity of sounding them. But so far as I have, I think they will behave with Temper and Moderation. The Boston Commissioners are warm, and I believe wish for a Non-importation Agreement, and hope that the Colonies will advise and justify them in a Refusal to pay for the Tea until their Aggrievances are redressed. They are in their Behaviuor and Conversation very modest, and yet they are not so much so as not to throw out Hints, which, like Straws and Feathers, tell us from which Point of the Compass the Wind comes. I dined with them on Thursday. I have had two Opportunities, one with the elder Rutlidge of Carolina, whose Sentiments and mine differ in no one Particular so far as I explained myself--and I was reserved in no Point save that of a Representation in Parliament. He is a Gentleman of an amiable Character--has look'd into the Arguments on both Sides more fully than any I have met with, and seems to be aware of all the Consequences which may attend rash and imprudent Measures. His younger Brother is rather warm. My other Opportunity was with the two New Hampshire Gentlemen. I found Col. Folsom very cool & moderate--Major Sullivan rather more warm, but very candid and has thought solidly on the Subject. I think neither of them intends to at tach himself more to the particular Cause of Boston than will be for the general Good. They requested Opportunities of exchanging Sentiments with me often on the Occasion--and all my Observations seemed to have full Weight with them. The Marylanders are not ar rived, and but Three of the Virginians, Peyton [Randolph], Bland, and Lee are arrived.(1) I have intimated to several of the Delegates the Necessity of sending Commissioners over, fully authorized, to the British Court, as a Mode pursued by the Roman, Grecian & Macedonian Colonies on every Occasion of the like Nature--that thro' them we may be enabled, in case our first Plan for accommodating our unhappy Differences should not be acceptable, to know the better what to propose next--that having these Gentlemen at the Scene of Action we shall be no longer misled by News-paper Accounts and private Letters, but shall proceed on solid Information and Principles of Safety-That without this, any Petitions or Plans, not having any Persons to explain and support them, will have very little Effect--That in all Probability the Measures of the present Congress will be deemed illegal & unconstitutional, and that upon this Point only the Necessity of sending Persons Home to insist upon the Right in the Colonies of being heard, and to prove that the Illegality of the Congress arises from the Measures of Power in not suffering the Assemblies to meet; SEPTEMBER 5, 1774  and if, after all, those Reasons should not procure due Attention to the Propositions of the Congress, to pray that the Governors may have Orders to permit such Meetings, and to give Assurances that their Conduct will be decent, respectful & dutiful to the Mother State --That a conduct of this kind cannot fail to give Strength to our Cause, and, if not immediately, in the End bring the Government to attend to Reason and redress our Aggrievances. These Intimations seemed to have their Weight, and, as far as I could observe, met with Approbation. You may depend on my communicating to you from Time to Time the Transactions, &c of the Congress.

5,dg0016,1774,James Duane s Notes of Debates,"""James Duane's Notes of Debates   Philadelphia Monday 5 September 1774 The Members of the Congress met at Smith's Tavern. The Speaker of the Pensylvania Assembly having offerd the Congress the use of the State house; & the Carpenters the use of their Hall, It was agreed to take a View of each. We proceeded to the Carpenter's hall. Mr Lynch proposed the Question whether as that was in all respects Suitable it ought not to be fixed upon without further Enquiry. I observed that if the State house was equally convenient it ought to be preferred being a provincial & the Carpenter's Hall a private House. And besides as it was tenderd by the Speaker it seemed to be a piece of respect which was due to him, at least to enquire whether the State House was not equally convenient. The Question was however called for; & a great Majority fixed upon the Carpenters hall. The Names of the Members were then called over; After which Mr Lynch proposed that we shoud elect a President or Chairman and named Mr Payton Randolph Speaker of the Assembly of Virginia, who was unanimously approvd & placed in the Chair. A Question was then put what Title the Convention should assume & it was agred that it should be called the Congress. Another Question was put what shoud be the Stile of Mr Randolph & it was agreed that he should be called the President. The next point was to fix on a Clerk or Secretary. Mr [ ](1) Thompson was proposd by Mr Lynch. Mr Jay observed that he had Authority to say that one of the SEPTEMBER 5, 1774  members of the Congress was willing to accept the Office & he con- ceivd the preference was due to him.(2) To which it was answerd that such an appointment woud deprive the Congress of a Member as he woud be too much incumberd by the Duties of a Clerk to attend to the Trust for which he was chosen. The Objection being thought Reasonable Mr Thompson was appointed by the Stile of Secretary of the Congress. The Credentials of the several Members were then read, and after those of New York were producd I observd that we did not assume the Character of provincial Delegates being only appointed for particular Counties,(3) That we were ourselves in doubt how far we were entitled to a Seat at a Congress of provincial Delegates & therefore movd that this point might be determined by the Congress (whether we should be received), Upon which it was unanimously resolved in the affirmative; and that such other Members as shoud come from the different Counties of New York shoud also be admitted to their Seats. I then movd that a Committee shoud be appointed to consider of Rules for the Conduct of the Congress & report them. This was opposd by Mr Letedge [Rutledge] the Elder who observd that doubtless the usage of the House of Commons woud be adopted in our Debates & that as every Gent. was acquainted with that usage It woud he a waste of Time to appoint a Committee on this Subject. It was answered that the Assemblies on the Continent had different Usages & Rules. That it was the Practice of Parliament that no member shoud speak more than once on the same point which woud be very inconvenient on the present Occasion. That there was the highest necessity for fixing a Rule on the present Occasion with respect to the Mode of Voting (to witt) whether the Sense of the Congress shoud be taken by the Majority of Voices of the Members; or Whether each Colony shoud have a Vote & the Majority be deter mined in that way? Upon motion these points were deferred for further consideration & the Congress adjournd until 10 oClo to Morrow morning.(4) ""

They next proceeded to chuse a Secretary, and, to my Surprize Charles Thomson (1) was unanimously elected. The New Yorkers and myself and a few others, finding a great Majority, did not think it prudent to oppose it. Both of these Measures, it seems, were privately settled by an Interest made out of Doors. I cannot say but from this Day's Appearance & Proceedings, I have altered very much my last Sentiments. The Virginians and Car- olinians, Rutlidge excepted, seem much among the Bostonians, and have at their Instance adopted the two above Measures. The Gentle men from New York have as little Expectations of much Satisfaction from the Event of Things as myself. Tomorrow we are to determine whether we are to vote by Colonies, each having a single Vote, or otherwise. ""

8,dg0019,1774,John Adams Notes of Debates,"""John Adams' Notes of Debates   [September 6, 1774](1) Mr. Henry. Government is dissolved. Fleets and Armies and the SEPTEMBER 6, 1774  present State of Things shew that Government is dissolved. Where are your Land Marks? your Boundaries of Colonies. We are in a State of Nature, Sir. I did propose that a Scale should be laid down. That Part of N. America which was once Mass. Bay, and that Part which was once Virginia, ought to be considered as having a Weight. Will not People complain, 10,000 (People) Virginians have not outweighed 1000 others. I will submit however. I am determined to submit if I am over ruled. A worthy Gentleman (Ego) near me, seemed to admit the Necessity of obtaining a more Adequate Representation. I hope future Ages will quote our Proceedings with Applause. It is one of the great Duties of the democratical Part of the Constitution to keep itself pure. It is known in my Province, that some other Colonies are not so numerous or rich as they are. I am for giving all the Satisfaction in my Power. The Distinctions between Virginians, Pensylvanians, New Yorkers and New Englanders, are no more. I am not a Virginian, but an American. Slaves are to be thrown out of the Question, and if the freemen can be represented according to their Numbers I am satisfyed. Mr. Lynch. I differ in one Point from the Gentleman from Virginia, that is in thinking that Numbers only ought to determine the Weight of Colonies. I think that Property ought to be considered, and that it ought to be a compound of Numbers and Property, that should determine the Weight of the Colonies. I think it cannot be now settled. Mr. Rutledge. We have no legal Authority and Obedience to our Determinations will only follow the reasonableness, the apparent Utility, and Necessity of the Measures We adopt. We have no coer- cive or legislative Authority. Our Constitutents are bound only in Honour, to observe our Determinations.. Govr. Ward. There are a great Number of Counties in Virginia, very unequal in Point of Wealth and Numbers, yet each has a Right to send 2 Members. Mr. Lee. But one Reason, which prevails with me, and that is that we are not at this Time provided with proper Materials. I am afraid We are not. Mr. Gadsden. I cant see any Way of voting but by Colonies. Coll. Bland. I agree with the Gentleman (Ego) who spoke near me, that We are not at present provided with Materials to ascertain the Importance of each Colony. The Question is whether the Rights and Liberties of America shall be contended for, or given up to arbitrary Power. Mr. Pendleton. If the Committee should find themselves unable to  ascertain the Weight of the Colonies, by their Numbers and Property, they will report this, and this will lay the Foundation for the Congress to take some other Steps to procure Evidence of Numbers and Property at some future Time. Mr. Henry. I agree that authentic Accounts cannot be had--if by Authenticity is meant, attestations of officers of the Crown. I go upon the Supposition, that Government is at an End. All Distinctions are thrown down. All America is all thrown into one Mass. We must aim at the Minutiae of Rectitude. Mr. Jay. Could I suppose, that We came to frame an American Constitution, instead of indeavouring to correct the faults in an old one--I cant yet think that all Government is at an End. The Measure of arbitrary Power is not full, and I think it must run over, before We undertake to frame a new Constitution. To the Virtue, Spirit, and Abilities of Virginia We owe much--I should always therefore from Inclination as well as Justice, be for giving Virginia its full Weight. I am not clear that We ought not to be bound by a Majority tho ever so small, but I only mentioned it, as a Matter of Danger, worthy of Consideration. ""

10,dg00111,1774,James Duane s Notes of Debates,"""James Duane's Notes of Debates   Tuesday the 6t September [1774] The Congress met And the first Question debated was whether the Congress shoud Vote by Colonies & what weight each Colony shoud have in the determination? Mr Henry from Virginia insisted that by the oppression of Parliament all Government was dissolvd & that we were reduced to a State of Nature. That there were no longer any such distinctions as Colonies. That he conceiv'd himself not a Virginian but an American. That one of the greatest Mischiefs to Society was an Unequal Repre- sentation. That there might & probably woud be further Occasions for a Congress & that it was time to form such a System as woud give each Colony a Just weight in our deliberations in proportion to its opulence & number of Inhabitants its Exports & Imports. He was answerd by Mr [ ](1) Of Rhode Island who insisted that every Colony shoud have an equal Vote. That we came if neces- sary to make a Sacrifice of our All & that the weakest Colony by such a Sacrifice woud suffer as much as the greatest. SEPTEMBER 6, 1774  Col. Harrison from Viriginia insisted Strongly on the Injustice that Virginia should have no greater Weight in the determination than one of the smallest Colonies. That he should be censurd by his Constituents & unable to excuse his want of attention to their Interest. And that he was very Apprehensive that if such a disrespect should be put upon his Countrymen we shoud never see them at another Convention . The debate then took a different Turn. It was observd that if an equal Representation was ever so Just the Delegates from the several Colonies were unprepard with Materials to settle that Equality. That was an Objection that coud not be answered. The Question was then put and 1. Resolved that the Sense of the Congress shall be taken by Voting in Colonies each to have one Vote. 2. Resolved that no person be permitted to speak twice on the same point unless with the Leave of the Congress. 3. Resolved that no Question be determined the same day it is debated if any one of the Colonies desires that the determination be deferred to another day. 4. Resolved that the doors of the Congress be kept shut during the debates And that every Member be obligd under the strongest obligation of Honor to keep secret the proceedings of the Congress until they shall be ordered to be publishd by the Congress. 5. Resolved that a Committee be appointed to state the Rights of the Colonies, the several Instances in which they have been violated & infringed and the means most proper to obtain Redress. 6. Resolved that a Committee be appoint'd to State & Report the several Statutes respecting the Trade & Manufactures of the Colo- nies. 7. A Question was put whether this Congress shoud be opend to morrow Morning with prayers. Mr Samuel Adams proposd the revnd Mr Duchè (2) for this Service. Debates arose on this Subject. Those who were for the motion insisting on the propriety of a Reverence & Submission to the Supreme Being & supplicating his Blessing on every Undertaking on the practice of the Romans the British Parliament & some of the Assemblies on the Continent. The difference of the religious Tenets of the Members. That it woud be considerd as Enthusiasm & Cant, & the Efficacy of private devotion. The want of a Suitable form in the book of Common prayers: And the Hazard of submitting such a Task to the Judgement of my Clergy were the Topics urged by those who were of opinion against the Motion. It was however Resolved that the Congress shall be opend tomorrow morning with  the Service of the Church of England & a suitable prayer & that Mr Duchè be requested by the president to perform this office. The Congress then adjourned till 9 oClock tomorrow morning. N B. During the meeting of the Congress an Express arriv'd to the Jersey Members giving Intelligence that the soldiers had seized the powder in one of the Towns near Boston. That a party was sent to take this; & that six of the Inhabitants had been killd in the Skirmish. That all the Country was in arms down to [ ](3) in Conneticut. That the Cannon fired upon the Town the whole Night. N B.

He wears the Manufacture of this Country, is plain, Sensible, above Ceremony, and carries with him more Force in his very appearance, than most powdered Folks, in their Conversation. He wears his hair strait, his Cloaths in the plainest order, and is highly esteemed. With him Are Two Brothers Mr. Rutledge senr., & junr. of inde- SEPTEMBER 7, 1774  pendent Fortune, ingenious, but impetuous in the Cause they are en gaged in; the Eldest I judge, of my Age, his Lady, & a Son of Jesse's age, is with him. They lodge at the Next Door. The Younger Brother, is a tolerable speaker, equally zealous. He married Mr. Gadsdens Daughter, who as I told you lodges with Us. Mr. Gadsden, leaves all N England Sons of Liberty, farr behind, for he is for taking up his Firelock, & marching direct to Boston, nay he affirmed this Morning, that were his Wife, and all his Children in Boston, & they were there to perish, by the sword, it would not alter his Sentiment or proceeding, for American Liberty, by which You may judge of the Man, when I add that he is one of the most regularly, religious Men I ever met with. Col. Middleton is the only remaining Member for that province whom I have not Characterized. He appears very modest, has said but little hitherto, is I judge Fifty Years of Age, and of a very slender Thin habit, but is in high esteem with his Acquaintance. Virginia comes Next but that must be the Business of a Future hour. This Evening I spent at Mr. Roberto's, a Gentleman of Fortune, who married Mr. Bostwicks Daughter.(1) She is a most amiable Woman, & often reminded Me of the late Mrs. Adam Babcock, whom she greatly resembled, both Hee, & she are Too zealous Presbyterians for Me which is all the Fault I find with them. They give Mr. Murray a very indifferent Character, but not as to Morals.(2) ""

17,dg00118,1774,James Duane s Propositions Before the Committee on Rights,"""James Duane's Propositions Before the Committee on Rights   [September 7-22, 1774](1) A firm Union between the Parent State and her Colonies ought to be the great object of this Congress. It is this alone which can ensure the permanent Stability of the british Empire & the mutual Happiness of its' respective Members. In the Resolves therefore to be adopted the Prerogatives of the Crown, the Interest of Great Britain and the Rights of the Colonies ought each to have their proper Influence, & our proceedings to be tempered not only with a Regard to justice but a desire of Reconciliation. I. The Supremacy of the Crown will be secured upon the Principle that the King is entitled to the same Allegiance and to the like royal Prerogatives in the respective Colonies as are due from his Subjects and appertains to his Sovereignty within the Realm of England. II. The Rights of the british Nation. These may be divided into two Branches. (1) The Advantages of Commerce. (2) Aids from the Colonists for the Defence of the Empire. (1) The Advantages of Commerce These arise . a. By furnishing the present State in preference to every other (Nation) Country with so much of the Produce of the Colonies as they can spare and she may require. b. By receiving from her exclusively every Commodity which she may raise or Manufacture, & of which we stand in need. 3. By admitting only her ships navigated with her Subjects to an commercial intercourse with the respective Colonies. 4. By Yielding Up to her the Power of regulating the general Trade of the Empire to answer these purposes, and to preserve a uniform System in this respect among the several Colonies. The difficulty is to establish a Principle upon which we can submit this Authority to Parliament without the Danger of (a hurtful Precedent) their pleading a Right to bind 215 in all Cases whatsoever. I think a solid Distinction may be taken. It has hitherto been a receivd Maxim that we brought over as our Birth right the Common Law of England, and such Statutes, applicable to our locale Circumstances, as existed at the Time of our Colon- SEPTEMBER 7, 1774  ization; and that these, with our Charter Rights, and provincial Codes, form our Colony Constitutions. This principle seems indisputable: because every Charter comprehends a prohibitory Clause against the enacting any Laws repugant to those of England; which necessarily implies that the latter must originally have extended and been the Basis of our Constitution. Some of the Colonies have been planted since the navigation Act passed in the Reign of King Charles the Second which explicitely asserts claims and reserves for the people of England the Commercial Advantages we have enumerated. In such Colonies therefore this Statute is a part of the Law of the Land. Others have adopted or ex tended it by positive Law. All have submitted to and acquiesed in its Authority for more than a Century. By all therefore the Regulation of Trade may be yielded to Parliament upon the footing of a Compact, reasonable in itself, & essentiel to the well-being of the whole Empire as a Commercial People. The Principle from which our (internal) exclusive Colony Legislation with respect to Taxation and internal Polity is derived, will not be crossed by such a Concession & this is the point to be guarded. (2) Aids from the Colonists for the Defence of the Empire. These are founded in Justice, due for Protection, and necessary for common Preservation. The Difficulty of drawing together the Strength, and the Just Contributions, of so many seperate Branches of the Empire, and the Danger of leaving it to the discretion of each, is the great Basis on which the Reasonableness of parliamentary Interposition is built. Nothing coud be more conciliatory than to obviate this Objection. For that Purpose it is proper 1. That each Colony shoud engage to provide a Competent and honourable Support for the administration of Government & Justice within its own Limits. 2. That considering the present perilous state of the Nation'l Funds, & the protection we constantly derive from it's Fleets, a present Supply be recommended in Lieu of the Mony extorted from Us under the fallacious Idea of regulating the Trade. 3. That a Plan be offered for ascertaining the Quotas and securing the Aids of every Colony in Case of future Emergency. 1st. The first we Justly consider as a priviledge instead of a Bur en. 2. To a present Supply is objected the Danger of it's being employed as a Means of Corruption: but this might be prevented by a specific Application: to the Support, for Instance, of a certain Num ber of the royal Navy on an American Establishment, the Funds to be raised by the Authority & on the Inhabitants of each Colony in such proportion as might be agreed upon in genrl. Congress.  3. The Plan for securing the Aids of the Colonies, in future Emergencies can only be established by the mutual Consent of the Crown & the respective Colony Assemblies. Would it not be sufficient for this purpose if Deputies from each respective House of Assembly shoud be authorized by provincial Laws, when calld Upon by the Crown, to meet it's Commissionr in a (Congress) general Continental Council and adjust the several Quotas and their determination to be declared decisive and binding upon each Colony. I do not know that the Dutch States have any other Bond of Union; or at least that one Province has by the Terms of the Confederacy coercive Authority over the other. Common Interest, which, is the only Cement of such States, will prove a sufficient obligation. III. The Rights of the Colonies. These as has been already inti- mated are derived 1. From the Common Law of England and such antient Statutes, applicable to our local Circumstances, as existed at the time of 0111 Colonization which are fundamentals in our Constitution. 2. From our respective Charters confirming those Rights. 3. From our several Codes of provincial Laws. Nothing seems necessary for the preservation of those Rights but an exclusive provincial Legislation in each Colony respecting Taxation and internal Polity, & comprehending the Dispensation of Justice both civil and criminal; & Subject only to the Negative of the Crown where that negative has not been ceded by royal Charter If these Ideas are Just, and properly arranged, then the Resolves of the Congress may be to the following Effect. I. That his Majesty is entitled to the same Allegiance and to the like royal Prerogatives in these his loyal Colonies as are due from his Subjects and constitute his Sovereignty within the Realm of England. II. That the Acts of Navigation, & for the Encouragement of Trade, passed in the reign of King Charles the second tho' in some Respects extremely burthensome to the Colonies do in their general Tendency establish wise and Salutary (Laws) Regulations, on which the Wealth Strength and Safety of the whole british Empire greatly depend; and having taken place before the Settlement of some Of the Colonies; and been adopted (and extended) in others in their Infancy by positive provincial Law; and in all having been submitted to and acquiesced in for more than a Century ought to be considered in the Light of a Compact between the Parent Kingdom and these Colonies(2) which has reserved to the british Parliament (an exclusive Authority) the Supreme direction & superintendance proper over the general Trade of all his Majesty's Dominions, And that this Authority interwoven with our Establishments from their first Rise ought not to be drawn into Question provided that it is bona fide restrained to the regulation of our Trade.  This was changd by:(3) And this Authority exercised bona fide for the purposes of securing the Commercial Advantages of the whole Empire to Great Britain with a Just Regard to the Interest of its respective Members ought not to be Questioned. But in this declaration we absolutely exclude every Idea of Taxation internal & external for raising a Revenue on the Subjects of America without their Consent.(4) [II.] That the Acts of Navigation and for the Encouragement of Trade passed in the Reign of King Charles the second tho' in some Respects extremely burthensome to the Colonies, do in this general Tendency establish wise & salutary Regulations on which the Wealth Strength and Safety of the whole british Empire greatly depend; And having become necessary by the policy of other Nations & taken place before the Settlement of some of the Colonies; and been adopted in others in their Infancy by positive Law; and in all submitted to and recognized for more than a Century ought to be considered in the Light of a Compact between the parent State and these Colonies. That from the Spirit of this Compact, & the Necessity of a Supreme controuling Power in this Respect, & for the Protection which we have enjoyed & still derive from Great Britain we cheerfully ac knowledge that it belongs only to Parliament to direct & superintend the Trade of all his Majesty's Dominions And that this Authority exercised bona fide for the Purposes of securing the Commercial Ad vantages of the whole Empire to Great Britain with a Just Regard to the Interests of its respective Members ought not to be drawn into Question. But in this Declaration we absolutely exclude every Idea of Taxation internal & external for raising a Revenue on the Subjects of America without their Consent. [II.] That the Acts of Navigation and for the Encouragement of Trade passed in the Reign of King Charles the second tho' in some Respects extremely burthensome upon the Colonists, do in their gen- eral Tendency establish wise & Salutary Regulations on which the Wealth Strength and Safety of the whole british Empire greatly de pend (From the Policy of other European Nations they became in dispensable highly expedient and That) And having taken place before the Settlement of some of the Colonies, in others been adopted in their Infancy by positive Laws and in all submitted to and recognized for more than a Century they ought to be considered in the Light of (a reasonable & beneficial) an ancient Compact between the parent State and the Colonies! From the Spirit (of these ancient Acts) whereof the (Necessity) Expediency of (one) a (Supream) controuling Power over the general Commerce of the Empire as well as on Account of the Protection we have derived from the (naval strength of the Parent Kingdom) parent Kingdom we chearfully acknowledge that it belongs only to the british Parliament to direct and superintend the  Trade of all his Majesty's Dominions, and that this Authority while it is exercised bona fide for the Purposes of Securing the Advantages of the Commerce of the whole Empire to Great Britain with a just Regard to the Interests of its respective Members ought not to be questioned. In this declaration we nevertheless absolutely exclude every Idea of Taxation internal and external for raising a Revenue on the Subjects of America without their Consent. III. That it is the Duty of the several Colonies not only to provide a Competent and honourable Support for the Administration of his Majesty's Government and the Dispensation of Justice within their respective Limits: but also to grant a present and annual Supply towards defraying the Expence of the royal Navy from which we derive the great Blessings of Protection in Common with the rest of our Fellow Subjects throughout the Empire. IV. That it is the Duty of the several Colonies on every Emergency that may threaten the Security (of any part) of the Empire to contribute their Aids of Men and money in the common Cause, ac cording to their several Abilities And that this Congress is firmly per- swaded that the respective Legislatures of the Colonies will agree to any reasonable Plan which shall be recommended by his Majesty for drawing forth the united Strength and Aids of these Branches of his royal Dominions Whenever it shall be found necessary. V. That the Colonies are (bound by and) entitled to the benefits of, the common Law of England and such of the Statutes of that Realm, [& from Experience have been found] applicable to [their respective] local Circumstances, as existed at the time of our Colonization.(5) We do not however admit but absolutely reject the Authority of the Statutes of 26th King Henry 8th [Ch. 13th] (6). and King Edward 6 respecting [the trials for] Treasons and Misprisions [or Concealmts] of Treasons [committd out of the Realm as applied to Us by a late Constructn. which would effectually destroy all Security of the Lives, Liberties & Properties of the Colonists] which can not, nor were intended to be of force where (Justice is duly administered) Tribunals are Established For the due Administration of Justice] according to the Laws of England, but only in remote and foreign parts where offenders for want of (proper) such Tribunals cannot be brought to legal Trial. That these his Majesty's Colonies are Lik [ewise] entitled to all the Immunities and Priviledges granted to them by the royal Charter and Confirmed and secured by their several Codes of provincial Laws; And that these respective Rights cannot be altered or abridged by any other Authority than that of their respective Legislatures. VI. That the Colonists within their several Colonies are respectively entitled to a free and exclusive power of Legislation in all Cases of Taxation and internal Polity, Subject only to the negative of the  Crown when that Negative has not been ceded by royal Charter. And that to the Representatives of the people in General Assembly consti- tute a fundamental indespensable Branch in such Legislation. ""

22,dg00123,1774,John Adams Notes of Debates,"""John Adams' Notes of Debates   Septr. 8. Thursday. [ 1774] In the Committee for States Rights, Grievances and Means of Redress. Coll. Lee. The Rights are built on a fourfold foundation--on Nature, on the british Constitution, on Charters, and on immemorial Usage. The Navigation Act, a Capital Violation.(1) Mr. Jay. It is necessary to recur to the Law of Nature, and the british Constitution to ascertain our Rights. The Constitution of G.B. will not apply to some of the Charter Rights. A Mother Country surcharged with Inhabitants, they have a Right to emigrate. It may be said, if We leave our Country, We cannot leave our Allegiance. But there is no Allegiance without Protection. And Emigrants have a Right, to erect what Government they please. Mr. J. Rutledge. An Emigrant would not have a Right to set up what constitution they please. A Subject could not alienate his Allegiance. Lee. Cant see why We should not lay our Rights upon the broadest Bottom, the Ground of Nature. Our Ancestors found here no Government. Mr. Pendleton. Consider how far We have a Right to interfere, with Regard to the Canada Constitution. If the Majority of the People there should be pleased with the new Constitution, would not the People of America and of England have a Right to oppose it, and prevent such a Constitution being established in our Neighbourhood. Lee. It is contended that the Crown had no Right to grant such Charters as it has to the Colonies--and therefore We shall rest our Rights on a feeble foundation, if we rest em only on Charters--nor will it weaken our Objections to the Canada Bill. Mr. Rutledge. Our Claims I think are well founded on the british Constitution, and not on the Law of Nature. Coll. Dyer. Part of the Country within the Canada Bill, is a con- SEPTEMBER 8, 1774  quered Country, and part not. It is said to be a Rule that the King can give a Conquered Country what Law he pleases. Mr. Jay. I cant think the british Constitution inseperably attached to the Person of every Subject. Whence did the Constitution derive is Authority? From compact. Might not that Authority be given up by Compact. Mr. Wm. Livingston. A Corporation cannot make a Corporation. Charter Governments have done it. K[ing] cant appoint a Person to make a Justice of Peace. All Governors do it. Therefore it will not do for America to rest wholly on the Laws of England. Mr. Sherman. The Ministry contend, that the Colonies are only like Corporations in England, and therefore subordinate to the Legis- lature of the Kingdom. The Colonies not bound to the King or Crown by the Act of Settlement, but by their consent to it. There is no other Legislative over the Colonies but their respective Assemblies . The Colonies adopt the common Law, not as the common Law, but as the highest Reason. Mr. Duane. Upon the whole for grounding our Rights on the Laws and Constitution of the Country from whence We sprung, and Charters, without recurring to the Law of Nature--because this will be a feeble Support. Charters are Compacts between the Crown and the People and I think on this foundation the Charter Governments stand firm. England is Governed by a limited Monarchy and free Constitu- tion. Priviledges of Englishmen were inherent, their Birthright and Inheritance, and cannot be deprived of them, without their Consent. Objection. That all the Rights of Englishmen will make us independent. I hope a Line may be drawn to obviate this Objection. James was against Parliaments interfering with the Colonies. In the Reign of Charles 2d. the Sentiments of the Crown seem to have been changed. The Navigation Act was made. Massachusetts denyed the Authority--but made a Law to inforce it in the Colony. Lee. Life and Liberty, which is necessary for the Security of Life, cannot be given up when We enter into Society. Mr. Rutledge. The first Emigrants could not be considered as in State of Nature--they had no Right to elect a new King. Mr. Jay. I have always withheld my Assent from the Position that every Subject discovering Land [does so] for the State to which they belong. Mr. Galloway. I never could find the Rights of Americans, in the Distinctions between Taxation and Legislation, nor in the Distinction between Laws for Revenue and for the Regulation of Trade. I have  looked for our Rights in the Laws of Nature--but could not find them in a State of Nature, but always in a State of political Society. I have looked for them in the Constitution of the English Government, and there found them. We may draw them from this Soursce securely. Power results from the Real Property, of the Society. The States of Greece, Macedon, Rome, were founded on this Plan. None but Landholders could vote in the Comitia, or stand for Offices. English Constitution founded on the same Principle. Among the Saxons the Landholders were obliged to attend and shared among them the Power. In the Norman Period the same. When the Land holders could not all attend, the Representation of the freeholders, came in. Before the Reign of H[enry] 4., an Attempt was made to give the Tenants in Capite a Right to vote. Magna Charta. Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots, Earls and Barons and Tenants in Capite held all the Lands in England. It is of the Essence of the English Constitution, that no Law shall be binding, but such as are made by the Consent of the Proprietors in England. How then did it stand with our Ancestors, when they came over here? They could not be bound by any Laws made by the British Parliament--excepting those made before. I never could see any Reason to allow that we are bound to any Law made since--nor could I ever make any Distinction between the Sorts of Laws. I have ever thought We might reduce our Rights to one. An Exemption from all Laws made by British Parliament, made since the Emigration of our Ancestors. It follows therefore that all the Acts of Parliament made since, are Violations of our Rights. These Claims are all defensible upon the Principles even of our Enemies--Ld. North himself when he shall inform himself of the true Principles of the Constitution, &c. I am well aware that my Arguments tend to an Independency of the Colonies, and militate against the Maxim that there must be some absolute Power to draw together all the Wills and strength of the Empire.

We are waiting with the Utmost Anxiety and Impatience, for further Intelligence.(1) The effect of the News We have both upon the Congress and the Inhabitants of this City, was very great--great indeed! Every Gen- tleman seems to consider the Bombardment of Boston, as the Bom- bardment, of the Capital of his own Province. Our Deliberations are grave and serious indeed. It is a great Affliction to me that I cannot write to you oftener than I do. But there are so many Hindrances, that I cannot. It would fill Volumes, to give you an Idea of the scenes I behold and the Characters I converse with. We have so much Business, so much Ceremony, so much Company, so many Visits to recive and return, that I have not Time to write. And the Times are such, as render it imprudent to write freely. We cannot depart from this Place, untill the Business of the Congress is compleated, and it is the general Disposition to proceed slowly. When I shall be at home I cant say. If there is Distress and Danger in Boston, pray invite our Friends, as many as possible, to take an Assylum with you. Mrs. Cushing and Mrs. Adams if you can. There is in the Congress a Collection of the greatest Men upon this Continent, in Point of Abilities, Virtues and Fortunes. The Mag- nanimity, and public Spirit, which I see here, makes me blush for the sordid venal Herd, which I have seen in my own Province. The Ad dressers, and the new Councillors, are held in universal Contempt and Abhorrence, from one End of the Continent to the other. Be not under any Concern for me. There is little Danger from any Thing We shall do, at the Congress. There is such a Spirit, thro the Colonies, and the Members of the Congress are such Characters, that no Danger can happen to Us, which will not involve the whole Continent, in Universal Desolation, and in that Case who would wish to live? Make my Compliments to Mr. Thaxter and Mr. Rice (2)--and to every other of my Friends. My Love to all my dear Children--tell them to be good, and to mind their Books I shall come home and see them, I hope, the latter End of next Month. Adieu. John Adams SEPTEMBER 8, 1774  P.S.

25,dg00126,1774,James Duane s Speech to the Committee on Rights,"""James Duane's Speech to the Committee on Rights   [September 8, 1774](1) The Task assigned to this Committee is no less important than it is difficult. It may be reduced to three Heads- 1. To State the Rights of the Colonies. 2. Their Grievances. 3. The Means of Redress. It is necessary that the first point, our Rights, should be fully discussed and established upon solid Principles: because it is only from hence that our Grievances can be disclosed; & from a clear View of both that proper Remedies can be suggested and applied. To ascertain the Constitutions of the Colonies has employed the Thoughts and the Pens of our ablest Politicians. But no System which has hitherto been published is solid or satisfactory. During Disputes which arose from the Stamp Act an Exemption from internal Taxes (seemed to be the ultimate of the General Voice Wish) seemed to give general Content. The Regulation of Commerce was submitted to Parliament. Their Authority to alter the police (and administration) of our respective Governments was not in Contemplation because it had not been exercised. Upon the Repeal therefore of the Stamp Act we had Reason to conclude that the Blessings of Security in our Liberties & Harmony with the Parent State woud be placed on a permanent Basis. But short was our Repose and fleeting our Expectations. A despotic Minister soon discovered that under the Idea of a commercial Regulation our Property might still be invaded, and that by a guileful Change of a name we might still be oppressed at his pleasure. Hence arose Mr Townsends project of loading british Commodities (which we are restrained from importing from any other Nation) with American Duties--As if this poor Evasion coud blind the Colonists, and conceal the Evil which was cloaked under so thin a dis guise. The Resentment & Vigorous opposition of this Country, & the immense Loss to which it exposed the british Manufacturers compeled the Repeal of this detested Law--Excepting the Article of Tea which has been the fatal Cause of our present Misfortunes. SEPTEMBER 8, 1774  It is now Sir essential to place our Rights on a broader & firmer Basis to advance and adhere to some solid and Constitutional Principle which will preserve Us from future Violations--a principle clear & explicite and which is above the Reach of Cunning, & the Arts of oppression. I hope if we have the Happiness to rest upon such a principle, we shall have the Fortitude and the strength to maintain it. Let it be founded upon Reason and Justice, and satisfy the Consciences of our Countrymen. Let it be such as we dare refer to the Virtuous and impartial part of Mankind, and we shall and must, in the issue of the Conflict, be happy & triumphant. (If this principle can call in to its Support) I conceive it to be the Duty of every Member to offer his Sentiments on this great Occasion without Reserve or Scruple. It will be examined with Candour and have all the weight it merits and if mine is defective it will be Excused from the uprightness of the Intention with which it is offered, & because it is an indispensable Duty. I shall not forget that we are Colonies, That we are indebted to her for the Blessings of Protection, and that she ought to derive from every commercial Advantage which is the Result of our Connection and Dependence, Nor shall I anticipate either our own past Merit or the cruel Oppressions under which we now labour, because these will more properly be the Subject of our next Head of Enquiry. To the Rights of the Colonies I mean at present to be confin'd. They may be (divided into two Heads) derived from two Sources. 1st. (As they are derived) from the common Law, & such ancient Statutes as are coeval with our (Emigration) Colonization. 2. As they are granted and secured by Charter. Upon This last head I shall (refer to) reserve myself for further Information from Gentlemen whose local Circumstances have led them to discuss it with more precision. then Leisure has enabled me. I shall only observe that their Charters are to be esteemed as Com pacts, that they have long been acquiesced in, and if exceptionable in their origin can not now be violated but by oppression.(2) The first is a principle that is more general and extensive if not more solid and secure: and this I shall proceed to consider. England is governed by a limited Monarchy and a free Constitution. But if the Subject is bound by a Law to which he does not assent, either personally or by his Representative, he is no longer Ire<< but under an arbitrary power, which may oppress or ruin him at pleasure. It is admitted by the English Judicatories and has been solemnly resolved by the King in privy Council; that the Common Laws of England and such Statutes as existed prior to our Emigration are fundamentals in our Colony Constitution. Upon this grand Basis the  prerogatives of the Crown & the Rights of the Subjects are as fully ascertained in the Plantations as in the parent State. By the same Constitution the King has the Executive power and is the Fountain of Title offices and Honours. Hence arises his royal Authority Prerogative(3) in the formation of Colonies to establish a System of Governt. Legislative, Juridical and executive suitable to the Circumstance of a People who are blessed with the Priviledges which they never meant nor were supposed, nor coud forfeit, (by removing to a distant a more remote part of the English Empire) by altering their local situation within the same Empire. The priviledges of Englishmen were inherent They were their Birth right and of which they coud only be deprived by their free Consent. Every Institution legislative and Juridical, essential to the Exercise & Enjoyment of these Rights and priviledges in constitutional Security, were equally their Birth right and inalienable Inheritance. They coud not be with held but by lawless oppression and by lawless oppression only can they be violated. It is objected that upon this principle the Colonies are independent and exempt from the Authority of the British parliament and free from all Obligation to render to the parent State those advantages which ought to be the Recompence of Protection, to result from the very nature of Colonization And to be justified from the Usage of every commercial Nation. To which it may be answerd that the Sovereignty and Prerogatives of the Crown (must effectually prevent the Independence of the Colonies) our own Security & the Ties of Friendship & common Interest the similiarity of our Government Laws and manners will be sufficient to prevent (a Rupture) an Independence which nothing but Oppression can ever reconcile to an American Ear. (With respect to the Advantages arising from our Commerce it is certain that if we were under no Obligation the principal Advantages woud center in the parent Country where Manufactures are as cheap better in Quality.) But we need not depend on this observation. Had Great Britain till this late day taken no measures to secure the Commerce of the Colonies but left them free to pursue their own Interest and Inclinations I shoud not hesitate to pronounce (any restrictive Act of Parliament of this late day to be) that all Restraints by Authority of Parliament would now be unauthoritative and oppressive. This however is not the Case. Every Just and reasonable Advantage the parent Country has long since effectually secured and uniformly enjoyed.(4) 1. That political Liberty is the great Object of the English Constitution.  2. That it is essential to Liberty that the Subject be bound by no Laws to which he does not assent by himself or his Representative; A privilege which forms the distinction between Freemen & Slaves for he that is bound to submit to the arbitrary will of another ""

Turner, and it being of such a Miscellaneous composition, I am unwilling it should pass through Too many hands, lest curiosity, should overcome delicacy in the passage, and the Consequence be a misconstruction of my Sentiments. It gives me some uneasiness to think that You will be disappointed by this Post that is this Week's post, but You will not blame Me, when You receive this Budget, and Find I have wrote to You every Day, and oftener. Yesterday After Noon my Freind Marshall call'd on Freind Deane, & Brother &c, & waited on Us to what is called the bettering House, in other Words, a poor House the particular Description of which must omit & say only, that it vastly exceeds all of the kind in America, put together, & I guess, equalls, in its excellent institutions any thing in Europe. It has ample room for Five Hundred Lodgers. There are about Three Hundred in it Old & Young, from the poor old Mortal expiring with Age to the Foundling pick'd up in the Streets but the Night before perhaps. All is Neat, & Clean, even the Rooms of the Sick, & the Walks & Yard very airy, and lightsome, the Yard & garden very Spacious. Here all that can SEPTEMBER 9, 1774  Labor, are put to it, and what they earn, goes into the common Stock. Here are above Fifty Looms, Wheels, &c, &c, in proportion, & those that can work at no Trade mend Cloaths, and clean Rooms, fetch & carry as We may say For those that do Labour. This House I judge, must have Cost Forty Thousand pounds and the annual Support of it, amounts To about Two Thousand, here are Two schools for the poor Children, and Nothing, that serves at once, to alleviate the Wants, & distresses of Age, Sickness, and poverty is unattended to. It put Me in mind at entering the house and meeting some poor old Women at the Door, Who seemed as rejoiced at seeing my Freind, as if he were their Son, of the Line of Pope--\""Where Age & Want, sat Smiling at the Gate.\"" All this is done by private donation, & cheifly by the people Called Quakers, among whom the Marshalls are some of the First--yet as if these People determined to outdo all the rest of the World, they never permit any of their Own poor to be sent here, but support them in a Neat House by themselves, which is provided With Gardens, but Too much in the Center of the City occasioned by its being built early whereas the Bettering House stands without the City in the Feilds. Returning We took a View of a more Melancholy Scene, a Prison Now erecting the Construction of which is most curious. It is 190 Feet in length, besides Two Wings of 120 Feet each. This I say is a more melancholy Scene, as it gives more gloomy Ideas, to view the punishments prepared for the Wicked, than provisions for the Releif of the Unfortunate & the miserable. I write as I view things, and as You will preserve this budget, after showing it To J. Webb &c will explain it on my Return more at Large.

Cajoe had some Complaints yesterday like the small Pox but he is much better this day that we think it was only a cold or Fatigue. As far as I can judge there will be very little Danger of my taking it. The Congress is full excepting the Gentlemen from North Carolina. We chose the Honble Payton Randolp Esqr. of Virginia President & Mr. Charles Thompson of this Town Secry. Agreed that each colony should have one Voice on every Question. This was warmly debated, some of the larger Colonies wanted a larger Number of voices. We agreed upon Honor not to discover any of the Proceed- ings until it was determined to make them public. You must therefore expect nothing from Me on that Head. We are as unanimous as expected. Much the largest Part of the Province is hearty in the Cause of Liberty.

By him You will receive Our proceedings to The Time of his Departure. The Family we Lodge in here consists of a Widow Lady turned of Forty as I judge, genteel & sensible, has been handsome, & is still comely. She has a Daughter her eldest Child, lately married to a Lieutenant, in the Regiment here, one Mr. Trist, who lodges with Us.(1) She has also Two Sons, that are one at Apprentice with a Merchant, the other at School. This is the standing Family, but every Room is now full. Two more Gentlemen from Charlestown So. Carolina--& a Sick Gentleman from Jamaica lodge here. The Two former arrived last Evening, the Latter poor Man has been here sometime, & will probably never more remove but by help of others to his last Lodgings,--the Grave. I have not seen him. The Officer here, is much to be pitied, his Commission is his principal dependence. He loves this Country, he loves his Young Wife, who is very deserving, and who is a warm daughter of Liberty, yet is ordered this Morning, to be ready, to March in the After Noon for Boston. This is really affecting and my passions are too sensible of soft impressions to view the Struggle between duty so called, Interest & Honor military on the one hand, and Affection, & an honest Regard & Tenderness on the other. As We have all dined, & supp'd together, on a free footing at the same Table, he seems the nearer to Us, and Our repeatedly asserting that the Troops at Boston would be cut off if they attempted anything against That Town & province, gives him & his Connections the most Uneasy & Melancholy Apprehensions. Could he get rid of his Commission on any Terms, short of ruining himself he would gladly do it. The Troops here which are to assist in reducing New England, & all America amount to One Hundred & Eighty of which [Sixty?] are old worn out, invalids, unable to March [as far] as Boston in Six Weeks were they to have the [plunder] of the Town for their asking ·and the rest disaffected to the unnatural employ. It is a doubt with me, whether the People here will let them March. Had Blood been shed by the Soldiery at Boston, there would have been No doubt at all for these Soldiers in that Case would before this have been disarmed, & dispersed, but it is dangerous to begin hostility, but on the most urgent occasion & indeed absolute Necessity. I design to view them when on their March. I gave you the Character of the South Carolina Delegates or rather a Sketch. I will now pursue the plan I designed. Mr. Randolph our worthy President may be rising of Sixty, of noble appearance, & presides with dignity. Col. Harrison may be Fifty an uncommonly large Man, and appears rather rough in his address, & speech. Col. Washington is nearly as Tall a Man as Col. Fitch and almost as hard a Countenance, yet with a very young Look, & an easy Soldier like Air, & gesture. He does not appear above Forty five, yet was in the first  Action in 1753 & 1754 on the Ohio, & in 1755, was with Braddock. & was the means of saving the remains of that unfortunate Army. I is said That in the House of Burgesses in Virginia, on hearing of the Boston port Bill, he offered to raise & Arm, & lead One Thousand Men himself at his Own Expence for the defence of the Country were there Need of it. His Fortune is said to be equall to such an un- dertaking. Col. Bland, is a plain sensible Man, deeply studied into & acquainted with the Antiquities, of Virginia, & of this Continent in General, has wrote several very sensible peices on the Subject, & is a tolerable Speaker in public, as is Col. Washington who speaks very Modestly, & in cool but determined Stile & Accent. Mr. Pendleton a Lawyer of eminence, of easy, and chearful Countenance, polite in address, & elegant, if not eloquent in Stile & elocution. Mr. Henry is also a Lawyer, and the compleatest Speaker I ever heard. If his future Speeches, are equall to the small Samples he had hitherto given Us, they will be worth preserving, but in a Letter I can give You no Idea of the Music of his Voice, or the highwrought, yet Natural elegance of his Stile, & Manner. Col. Lee, is said to be his Rival in Eloquence, & in Virginia & to the Southward they are stiled the Demosthenes, & Cicero of America. God Grant they may not, Like the plead in Vain for the Liberties of their Country. These last Gentlemen are Now in full Life, perhaps near Fifty & have made the Constitution, & history of G Brittain, & America their Capital Study ever since the late Troubles between them have arose. Sunday. We dined Yesterday with Mr. Wharton a plain, hospitable, quaker Family, of great Connections in this City, & on this Continent as well as in Europe but I think has as much of the Serpent. as the Dove in his Composition. He treated Us, with the utmost politeness and Carried Us in his Coach after Dinner to his Country Seal, about Ten Miles South of this City to view the Country which is fine, & rich, almost beyond Comparison. The Industry of this City exceeds any thing You can have an Idea of. The Delaware naturally overflowed at every Tide, a large Tract of Land, on which Consequently nothing grew but Alders & Rushes. This they enclosed with a dike for miles in Length and by keeping The Tide Out have made it the richest Meadow, I ever saw, it is said to contain Fifty Thousand Acres. I honestly owned beat To Mr. Wharton, for though I have seen as good Land in Wethersfield, I never saw such an extent of it. This Morning We set out to look up Mr. Deshay, but being unwell, he only read prayers, & Mr. White preached. After Dinner we went to Mr. Sprouts but finding that Neither Mr. Sprout, nor Mr. Spencer preached, but an indifferent old Gentleman, I push'd on, & heard Mr. Coombs who is call'd a Rival to Mr. Deshay and at Evening heard Mr. Spencer who is a very sensible good preacher.(2) SEPTEMBER 11, 1774  ""

Gadsden is violent against allowing to Parliament any Power of regulating Trade, or allowing that they have any Thing to do with Us. Power of regulating Trade he says, is Power of ruining us--as bad as acknowledging them a Supream Legislative, in all Cases SEPTEMBER 14, 1774  whatsoever. A Right of regulating Trade is a Right of Legislation, and a Right of Legislation in one Case, is a Right in all. This I deny. Attended the Congress and Committee all the forenoon. Dined with Dr. Cox. Dr. Morgan, Dr. Rush, Mr. Bayard, old Mr. Smith dined with us. Dr. Rush lives upon Water Street and has from the Windows of his back Room and Chamber, a fine Prospect of Delaware River, and of New Jersey beyond it. The Gentlemen entertained us, with Absurdities in the Laws of Pensylvania, New Jersey and Maryland. This I find is a genteel Topic of Conversation here.

48,dg00149,1774,Samuel Adams to the Boston Committee of Correspondence,"""Samuel Adams to the Boston Committee of Correspondence   Gentlemen Philada. Sept 14 1774 I have been waiting with great Impatience for a Letter from the Committee of Correspondence for the Town of Boston upon whose Wisdom and Judgment I very much rely.(1) The Congress is resolved into Committees and Sub Committees and all seem fully sensible of the Intollerable Grievances which the Colonies are struggling under, and determined to procure effectual Redress. The Subject Matter of their Debates I am restraind upon Honor from disclosing at present; but I may assure you that the Sentiments of the Congress hitherto discovered and the Business assignd to the several Committees are such as perfectly coincide with your Expectations. The Spirit of our Countrymen does them great Honor. Our Brethren of the County of Middlesex have resolved nobly, and their Resolutions are read by the several Members of this Body with high Applause. (2) It is generally agreed that an opposition to the new Mode of Government ought to be maintained. A warm Advocate for the Cause of Liberty to whom America is much obligd for his former Labors told me that he was fully of opinion that no officer under the new Estab- lishment ought to be acknowledgd; on the other hand that each of them should be warned against exercising any Authority upon pain of the utmost Resentment of the people. It is therefore greatly to his Satisfaction to observe the Measures that have been taken. I am pleasd to hear that a provincial Congress is proposd, & cannot but promise my self that the firm manly and perservering opposition of that single province will opperate to the total frustration of the villanous designs of our Tyrants and their Distruction. I hope the Committee will continue to Act up to their Dignity and Importance. I am yet of opinion that Heaven will Honor them with a great Share of the Merit of saving the Rights of all America. May God inspire them with Wisdom & Fortitude. I must beg them to ex- SEPTEMBER 14, 1774  cuse this hasty Effusion of an honest heart, having been just now(while in a Committee) informed that a Vessell is immediately about to Sail to Marblehead.

When the Congress first met, Mr. Cushing made a Motion, that it should be opened with Prayer. It was opposed by Mr. Jay of N. York and Mr. Rutledge of South Carolina, because we were so divided in religious Sentiments, some Episcopalians, some Quakers, some anabaptists, some Presbyterians and some Congregationalists, so that We could not join in the same Act of Worship. Mr. S. Adams arose and said he was no Bigot, and could hear a Prayer from a Gentleman of Piety and Virtue, who was at the same Time a Friend to his Country. He was a Stranger in Phyladelphia, but had heard that Mr. Duchè (Dushay they pronounce it) deserved that Character, and therefore he moved that Mr. Duchè, an episcopal Clergyman, might be desired, to read Prayers to the Congress, tomorrow Morning The Motion was seconded and passed in the Affirmative. Mr. Randolph our President, waited on Mr. Duchè, and received for Answer that if his Health would permit, he certainly would. Accordingly next Morning he appeared with his Clerk and in his Pontificallibus, and read several Prayers, in the established Form; and then read the Collect for the seventh clay of September, which was the Thirty fifth Psalm. You must remember this was the next Morning after we heard the horrible Rumour, of the Cannonade of Boston. I never saw a greater Effect upon an Audience. It seemed as if Heaven had ordained that Psalm to be read on that Morning. After this Mr. Duchè, unexpected to every Body struck out into an extemporary Prayer, which filled the Bosom of every Man pre sent. I must confess I never heard a better Prayer or one, so well pronounced. Episcopalian as he is, Dr. Cooper himself never prayed with such fervour, such Ardor, such Earnestness and Pathos, and in Language so elegant and sublime--for America, for the Congress. for The Province of Massachusetts Bay, and especially the Town of Boston. It has had an excellent Effect upon every Body here. I must beg you to read that Psalm. If there was any Faith in the sortes Virgilianae, or sortes Homericae, or especially the Sortes biblicae, it would be thought providential. It will amuse your Friends to read this Letter and the 35th. Psalm to them. Read it to your Father and Mr. Wibirt. I wonder what our Braintree Churchmen would think of this? Mr. Duchè is one of the most ingenious Men, and best Characters, and greatest orators in the Episcopal order, upon this Continent--Yet a Zealous Friend of Liberty and his Country.(1) SEPTEMBER 17, 1774  I long to see my dear Family.

Saturday Sepr. 17th 1774 By Express Which arrived here Yesterday, from the Committee of the Town of Boston to the general Continental Congress, Who are Informed the County of Suffolk of which the Town of Boston is the Capital, had entered into Certain Resolutions, a Copy of Which was inclosed us. Generally to the purport of not Suffering the Commander in Chief to Execute the Act of Parliament changing their Government by Persuading, protecting and Compelling officers under the new Regulation to Resign and by a Refusal in jurymen to Serve &c, That they have ordered all those able to bear Arms to keep in Readiess, to defend their inherent rights, Even with Loss of Blood & Treasure; That they are determined not [to] Injure the General or [any of the Kings Troops, Unless Compelled thereto by an Attack made by the Troops on them. They complain of the General's Seizing the Powder at Cambridge Which they say was private property; and also that he is now fortifying the only pass that leads from the Town of Boston into the Country from Whence the inhabitants of the Town are daily Supplied. This pass is a Narrow Neck of Land about 120 yards wide, at Which he has placed a Number of Troops and 28 Canon. That the Country people passing and repassing this place are Suffered to be insulted by the Soldiery. And that the inhabitants feared (from those Movements of the General) he had designs of Apprehending and sending to England those persons who have Stood foremost in the great Cause of Liberty. That in Consequence of his Conduct, and these their Suspitions, the inhabitants of Suffolk sent (by a Committee appointed for that purpose) An address to the General, enquiring the Cause of his Stopping up and fortifying the pass, Seizing and Securing the Magazine's &c., & Their disaprobation of his Conduct--and that they had no Intention to assault either him or his Soldiers--But that if he Continued to block up the pass, and thereby prevent them the only Means of Supplying the Town with necessaries--they should Look upon it, as a Commencement of Hostilities. Upon the whole They Sent an Express to the General Congress here, for their SEPTEMBER 17, 1774  Instructions as to their future Conduct. The Congress met on that business this day and have Resolved thereon--Which You Will see in the Packet of Munday being ordered imediately to be printed, as Well that the General, as the people might know What they thought of the Matter. If Morris or Henry Stays till Munday I Will Send you the Monday's paper. Mr. Richard Penn has got Hockley office (1)--about £1200 a Year.

I wrote you on Saturday by John Morris, the St. Jones's Creek Shallop man who was to leave town that night, with him also I directed another paper inclosing the New York news-paper of Thursday last. With this letter which will go by Matthew Henry's Shallop, I shall inclose you the Penna. packet of this day. Some time ago, I do not doubt but you were all much alarmed on a report that the King's ships were firing on the town of Boston. When that news came to this city the Bells were muffled & kept ring ing all that day. However, in a few days after that news was contradicted here, & hope by this time it is so with you. By some late very authentick accts. from Boston govt. to the gentn of that place now at the Congress, We are informed that there was about 3 days between is reports passing thro' the Mass. & Conn. govts. & its being contra- SEPTEMBER 19, 1774  dicted. That when the expresses went to contradict this false report, they found in those 2 govts. in different parties upward of 50,000 men well-armed, actually on their march to Boston for the relief of the inhabitants & that every farmer who had a cart or waggon (& not able to bear arms) were with them loaded with provisions, ammunition, baggage &c, all headed by experienced officers who had served in the Late American war, & That vast numbers more were preparing to march. Upon the news being contradicted, they returned peaceably to their several places of abode--but not till they had sent some of their officers from the different parties to Boston to know the real situation of affairs there & to direct them what principal officers in the different parts of the country they should hereafter send expresses to--in case they should stand in need of their assistance. It is supposed by some of the friends of liberty at Boston that the alarm was set on foot by some of the friends to the ministerial plan in order to try whether there was that true valor in the people. If this was the case, I suppose you will think with me that by this time they Can have no doubts remaining. Indeed, I think it is proved by the Gens. own conduct, for ever since that, he has been fortifying himself, which I imagine is more for his own security than to attack the inhabitants. Yesterday afternoon Capt. All from London came up to town. But no news that he may have bro't has as yet transpired, except that friends to the American Cause are daily increasing on the other side of the water. I am yours, Caesar Rodney ""

All and Mr. Maes's Brother--a very agreable Company. Our Regret at the Loss of this Company was very great. Mr. Dickenson was very agreable. A Question was started about the Conduct of the Bostonian Merchants since the Year 1770, in importing Tea and paying the Duty. Mr. Hancock it is said has received the Freight of many Chests of Tea. I think the Bostonian Merchants are not wholly justifiable--yet their Conduct has been exaggerated. Their fault and guilt has been magnified. Mr. Hancock I believe is justifiable, but I am not certain, whether he is strictly so. He owned a Ship in Partnership with Geo. Hayley, who is agreed here to be a ministerial Man, and Haley I suppose sent the Tea in the Ship. ""

74,dg00179,1774,Richard Henry Lee to William Lee,"""Richard Henry Lee to William Lee   Dear Brother, Philadelphia 20th Septr 1774 We have been here in full Congress of Deputies from the Principal Colonies near three weeks proceeding slowly but with great unanimity on the important business that brought us to this Town. The proceedings are yet on honor to be kept secret, but we have great hopes that their vigor and unanimity will prove the ruin of our Ministerial Enemies and the salvation of American Liberty. About a fortnight ore will produce a publication of our plan, after which you shall have it by the first opportunity. Since we came to this place, a universal alarm has been occasioned by a report that Boston had just been Cannonaded. This proves not true, and took its rise from a night maneuvre of the Generals, to seize some Provincial Powder that had been stored by law for Militia uses. The report served however to SEPTEMBER 20, 1774  show the spirit and situation of the people in that part of America, for we have good intelligence that 50,000 Men were in Arms in the Massachusetts Government and Connecticut, and that 30,000 were on march, well armed and provided, to Boston when they were informed all was peace at that place, on which they quietly returned home. Does not this shew that no small difficulty will attend forcing a submission from these people, and they are most firmly resolved to dye rather than submit to the change of their Government. In this too they will have the concurring support of the other Colonies as the Congress have in fact already published their determination by approving in strong terms the resolves of the County of Suffolk as the inclosed Paper will shew you. It seems to me, that if Ministry have not their hearts hardened, as the Scripture has it, they will best consult the good of their Country and their own safety by a prudent and speedy reversal of their ill judged measures. For they may be certain of a full, complete, and steadly opposition from all North America--I mean every part of it that is worth regarding. Give my love to the Doctor and communicate this letter to him.(1) I heartily wish my Sister & yourself health and happiness. Farewell. Richard Henry Lee ""

75,dg00180,1774,Isaac Low to William Wickham and David Matthews,"""Isaac Low to William Wickham and David Matthews   Gentlemen Philadelphia, September 20, 1774 I did not receive your favor of 16th instant time enough to answer it by return of the post. Mr. Herring [Haring] has not yet made his second appearance; nor did we imagine Mr. Wisner would have had the confidence to present himself as a delegate after knowing the cir- cumstances which were communicated to us relative to his election.(1) It was therefore thought by my colleagues most advisable to show him your letters on that subject. He was not in the least disconcerted, but expressed great satisfaction at being treated with so much candor, and in return thought himself bound in gratitude to show us with equal frankness the certificates on which he founded his pretensions, leaving us at full liberty afterwards to make such use of the intelligence received from you as we thought proper. From the face of his certificates,(2) the one signed by Col. [Vincent] Matthews, the other by Ba[l]thazar De Hart (copies of which I now enclose), we were of opinion his election would appear too regular to be set aside by anything we could produce to the contrary; especially as the fact we SEPTEMBER 21, 1774  principally relied on, as related in a letter to you from Col. Matthews, The chairman, might seem to be in a great measure invalidated by his certificate as chairman \""at a meeting of the inhabitants of the precincts of Goshen and Cornwall.\"" And Mr. De Hart's certificate might probably pass for those others of the county. Upon the whole it was our unanimous opinion that we could not with any prospect of success oppose Mr. Wisner's qualifications on the evidence we were yet possessed of, but to wait for the vouchers which you seem so de- termined to exhibit against him, which we must submit to your dis- cretion. MS not found; reprinted from Franklin Burdge, A Second Memorial of Henry Wisner (New York: Privately Printed, 1898), pp. 15-16. 1 John Haring and Henry Wisner were elected as delegates for Orange County on August 16 at a meeting \""of all the Committees of the County of Orange,\"" reportedly attended by only 20 of the county's estimated 1,000 eligible freeholders. Wisner, perhaps in an effort to broaden his support, had his election confirmed on September 3 at a meeting of the inhabitants of the Orange County precincts of Goshen and Cornwall, after which he went to Philadelphia and took his seat in Congress on the 14th. Wisner won this second election by only two votes, however, and then alledgedly only through some electoral irregularities, which William Wickham and David Matthews, both conservatives, described to Low in a letter of September 16, now lost. Wisner managed to overcome the complaints of Wickham and Matthews, as Low goes on to explain here, by producing certificates attesting to the validity of his joint election with Haring in August and his own confirmatory election in September. Hence he retained his seat and was joined on the 26th by Haring, who was then admitted to Congress. Burnett, who in this respect was otherwise very scrupulous, knew that Wisner attended the First Congress but failed to mention it in his record of Wisner's service as a delegate.

I told you in my Last That I could not in future be so particular, but as I gave you a sketch of the S.

Trumbull: a Lawyer by profession, ingenious, polite, SEPTEMBER 23, 1774  spirited, & tolerably eloquent, the other Two are Men of about Forty, to appearance of sedate, & settled Characters, well affected, to the general Cause, but have not spoke as yet publicly. On Tuesday We dined with Mr. Read [Joseph Reed], a Gentleman of the Law, very polite, & sensible, he married the Boston Agent Mr Deberts Daughter in London, and though small is of a most elegant figure, & countenance. She is a Daughter of Liberty zealously affected in a good Cause. On Wednesday We dined with Mr. Biddle, a Freind lately married to a young Lady, in Rhode Island. He brought her home but last Week. Her Name I think was [Cornel?] of a Freind Family there, though indeed the younger, & politer part of that profession in this City are not distinguishable, but in a very few particulars, from other people. Mr Biddle was a young Widower, is a peculiar Freind to the New England People, and seems to have even a great prejudice in their favor.

My dear sir Philadelphia Sept [24] 1774 Your Letter of the 12 Instant directed to Mr Cushing and others came duly to hand. The Subject of it is of the greatest Importance. It is difficult at this Distance to form a Judgment with any Degree of Accuracy of what is best to be done. The Eastern and Western Counties appear to differ in Sentiment with regard to the two Measures mentiond in your Letter. This Difference of Sentiment might produce opposition in Case either part should be taken. You know SEPTEMBER 24, 1774  the vast Importance of Union. That Union is most likely to be obtaind by a Consultation of Deputies from the several Towns either in a house of Representatives or a provincial Congress. But the Question still remains, which Measure to adopt. It is probable the people would be most united as they would think it safest to abide by the present form of Government, I mean according to the Charter. The Governor has been appointed by the Crown according to the Charter, but he has placed himself at the head of a different Constitution. If the only constitutional Council chosen last May have honesty and Courage enough to meet with the Representatives chosen by the People by Virtue of the last Writ and joyntly proceed to the publick Business, would it not bring the Governor to such an explicit Conduct as either to restore the General Assembly or give the two houses a fair Occasion to declare the Chair vacant, in which Case the Council would hold it till another Governor should be appointed. This would immediately reduce the Government prescribed in the Charter, and the people would be united in what they would easily see to be a constitutional opposition to Tyranny. You know there is Charm in the Word Constitutional. ""

As the all important American Cause so much depends upon each Colony acting agreably to the Sentiments of the whole it must be useful to you to know the Senti- ments which are entertaind here of the Temper and Conduct of our Province. Heretofore we have been accounted by many, intemperate and rash; but now we are universally applauded as cool and judicious as well as Spirited and brave. This is the Character we sustain in Congress. There is however a certain Degree of Jealousy in the Minds of some that we aim at total Independency not only of the Mother Country but of the Colonies too: and that as we are a hardy and brave People we shall in time over run them all. However groundless this Jealousy may be, it ought to be attended to, and is of Weight in your Deliberations on the Subject of your last Letter.

The Congress have in their resolve of the 17 Instant given their Sanction to the Resolutions of the County of Suffolk (1).--One of which is to act merely upon the defensive so long as such Conduct may be justified by Reason & the principles of Self preservation, but no longer. They have great Dependence upon your tryed Patience and fortitude. They suppose you mean to defend your civil Constitution. They strongly recommend Perseverance in a firm & temperate Conduct and give you a full pledge of their united Efforts in your Behalf. They have not yet come to final resolutions. It becomes them to be deliberate, I have been assured in private Conversation with Individuals that if you should be driven to the Necessity of acting in Defence of your Lives or Liberty, you would be justified by their Constituents and openly supported by all Means in their power but whether they will ever be prevaild upon to think it necessary for you to set up another form of Government, I very much question for the Reason I have before suggested. It is of the greatest Importance that the American opposition should be united, and that it should be conducted so as to concur with the opposition of our friends in England. Adieu. ""

94,dg00199,1774,George Washington to Joseph Chew,"""George Washington to Joseph Chew   Dear Sir, Philadelphia Sept. 25. 1774 It would have given me sincere pleasure to have serv'd you in your request of March the 10th (which by the by did not come to my SEPTEMBER 25, 1774  hands till sometime late in May; after Colo. Pendleton, at the desire of Mr. Maddison, had made an unsuccesful application to Lord Dunmore for the Land you claim under your Brother Colby; whose merits well entitles his heir to the Kings bounty).(1) I say to have serv'd you in this affair would have given me a singular pleasure, and I should have set about the work with great chearfulness had I not in an exact similar Instance been repuls'd by his Lordship before; and made acquainted much abt. that time, by him, that he had just receivd orders to grant no more Lands to any person whatsoever till his Majestys further pleasure should be known. In consequence of which (though it would not, he added affect the Warrants he had granted antecedant thereto, and which were many) he absolutely refused to Issue Warrants to those who personally applied. Under these Circumstances, and, as I before observed, a refusal to Colo. Pendleton, I Judg'd it altogether inexpedient to apply till things should put on a different face; but if I can at any time hereafter serve you in this, or any other matters, I shall do it with great chearfulness, as l shall always retain a grateful Remembrance of the Civilities I have receivd at your hands. It gave me exceeding great concern to hear that any untoward accident or losses should injure you either in your property, or domes tick felicity--and the more so, as the death of Sir William Johnson. on whom you seem'd to rely, may possibly be attended with some ad- ditional misfortune. In respect to the New Government on the Ohio, I scarce know what acct. to give you of it. For four years last past we have been told that the next Packet was to bring a confirmation of the Grant &c. This is still the cry among the friends to that Government in this City, but the authorities for the Report I am ignorant of. In the meanwhile, the Country is filling with People, and but for the disturbances with the Indians, I suppose by next Spring all the valuable Lands within the limits of their Grant would have been claim'd if not settled. What will be the consequence of all this I know not--great confusion I fear will ensue if the Government should take place. Not knowing before, in what manner to convey a Letter to you, is the cause of My silence till this time, & not the want of Inclination as I shall always be glad to hear from you--being Dr Sir Yr. Most Obedt. Servt. G. Washington ""

The 1st of Novr. ought to be fixed, for no honest orders were sent after the first of June. Orders are generally sent in April and May. But the Intention was known, of a Non Importation. Coll. Bland. I think the Time ought to be fixed, when Goods are shipp'd in Great Britain, because a ship may have a long Voyage. Mr. Gadsden. For the 1st of Novr. We may be deceived and defrauded, if we fix it to the Time when Goods are shipped. Coll. Lee. Invoices have been antedated. Mr. John Rutledge. I think all the Ways and Means should be proposed. Mr. Mifflin. Proposes Stoppage of Flax seed and Lumber to the West Indies--and Non Importation of dutied Articles--to com- mence 1st. Aug. 1775. Mr. Chace. Force, I apprehend is out of the Question, in our present Enquiry. In 1770, the annual Tax was 13 millions. Last Year it was only 10 millions. Land Tax, Malt Tax, perpetual Funds, amount to only 10 mil lions. They are compelled to raise 10 millions in time of Peace. The Emigrations from G. Britain prove that they are taxed as far as they can bear. A total Non Import and Non Export to G. Britain and W. Indies must produce a national Bankruptcy, in a very short Space of Time. The foreign Trade of G. Britain is but four Million and an half. As great a Man as ever Britain produc'd, calculated the Trade with the Colonies at two Millions. I believe the Importation to the Colonies now represented, may be three millions. A Non Exportation amounts to 3 millions more, and the Debt due to four Million. Two thirds in the Colonies, are cloathed in British Manufactures. Non Exportation of vastly more importance than a Non Importation--it affects the Merchants as well as Manufacturers, the Trade as well as the Revenue. 60 thousand Hdds. of Tobacco--225 british Ships employed. I am for a Non Exportation of Lumber to W. Indies immediately. The Importance of the Trade of the West Indies to G. Britain almost exceeds Calculation. SEPTEMBER 26, 1774  The Sugar carries the greatest Revenue--the Rum a great deal. If you dont stop the Lumber immediately, you cant stop it at all. If it takes Place immediately, they cant send home their next Years Crop. A Non Exportation at a future day, cannot avail us. What is the Situation of Boston and the Massachusetts. A Non Exportation at the Virginia Day, will not opperate before the fall 1766 [1776]. I[t] would not affect the Trade of the Colonies to the Mediterranean or other Parts of the World. I am for a more distant Day than the first of November. Mr. Linch. We want not only Redress, but speedy Redress. The Mass. cant live without Government I think one Year. Nothing less than what has been proposed, by the Gentleman last speaking, will put the Colonies in the State I wish to see them in. I believe the Parliament would grant us immediate Relief. Bankrupcy would be the Consequence if they did not. Mr. Gadsden. By saving our own Liberties, we shall save those of the West Indies. I am for being ready, but I am not for the sword. The only Way to prevent the sword from being used is to have it ready. 'Tho the Virginians are tied up, I would be for doing it without them. Boston and New England cant hold out--the Country will be deluged in Blood, if We dont Act with Spirit. Dont let America look at this Mountain, and let it bring forth a Mouse. Mr. Chace. We cant come into a Non Exportation immediately without Virginia. Mr. Cushing. For a Non Importation, Non Exportation and Non Consumption, and immediately. Coll. Bland. It has been our Glory [. . . .] (2) Mr. Hooper. We make some Tobacco. I was instructed to Protest vs. Petitioning alone. Tar, Pitch, and Turpentine We can ship nowhere but to Great Britain. The whole of the Subsistence of the People in the Southern Parts, are from naval Stores. G. Britain cannot do without Naval Stores, from N. Carolina. Mr. Ed. Rutledge. A Gentleman from the other End of the Room talked of Generosity. True Equality is the only public Generosity. If Virginia raises Wheat instead of Tobacco they will not suffer. Our Rice is an enumerated Commodity. We shall therefore loose all our Trade. I am both for Non Im and Exportation to take Place immediately. Mr. Henry. We dont mean to hurt even our Rascalls--if have any. I move that December may be inserted instead of November.  Mr. Jay. Negociation, suspension of Commerce, and War are the only three things. War is by general Consent to be waived at present. I am for Negociation and suspension of Commerce.(3) Coll. Lee. All Considerations of Interest and Equality of Sacrifice should be laid aside. Produce of the other Colonies, is carried to Markett, in the same Year when it is raised, even Rice. Tobacco is not untill the next Year. Mr. Sullivan. We export Masts, Boards, Plank, Fish, Oil and some Potash. Ships, we load with Lumber for the West Indies, and thence carry Sugar to England and pay our Debts that Way. Every kind of Lumber, We export to West Indies. Our Lumber is made in Winter. Our Ships sale in Jany. or Feby. for W. Indies. Coll. Dyer. They have now drawn the Sword, in order to execute their Plan, of subduing America. And I imagine they will not sheath it, but that next Summer will decide the Fate of America. To withdraw all Commerce with Great Britain at once, would come upon them like a Thunder Clap. By what I heard Yesterday, G. Britain is much more in our Power, than I expected--the Masts from the Northward--the Naval Stores from N. Carolina. We are struggling for the Liberties of the West Indies and of the People of G. Britain as well as our own--and perhaps of Europe. Stopping the Flax Seed to Ireland would greatly distress 'em. Govr. Ward. Mr. Cushing. Whoever considers the present State of G. Britain and America must see the Necessity of spirited Measures. G.B. has drawn the sword against Us, and nothing prevents her sheathing it in our Bowells but Want of Sufficient Force. I think it absolutely necessary to agree to a Non Importation Non Exportation immediately.(4) ""

I receive a greater Pleasure from the Letters of my Friends, than ever, and every Line We receive is of Use to us. Before this reaches you, the Sense of the Congress concerning your Wisdom, Fortitude and Temperance, in the Massachusetts in general and the County of Suffolk in particular, will be public, in our Country. It is the universal Sense here that the Mass. Acts and Murder Act ought not to be Submitted to a Moment. But then, when you ask the Question what is to be done? they answer Stand Still. Bear, with Patience. If you come to a Rupture with the Troops all is lost. Resuming the first Charter, Absolute Independency &c are Ideas which Startle People here. It Seems to be the general opinion here that it is practicable for Us, in the Massachusetts to live wholly without a Legislature and Courts of Justice as long as will be necessary to obtain Relief. If it is practicable, the general Opinion is, that We ought to bear it. The Commencement of Hostilities is exceedingly dreaded here. It is thought that an Attack upon the Troops, even tho it should prove successfull and triumphant, would certainly involve the whole Continent in a War. It is generally thought here that the Ministry would rejoice at a Rupture in Boston, because that would furnish him with an Excuse to the People at home, and unite them with him in an opinion of the Necessity of pushing Hostilities against Us. On the Contrary, the Delegates here and other Persons from all Parts, are universally, very Sanguine, that if Boston and the Massa- chusetts can possibly Steer a middle Course between Obedience to the Acts, and open Hostilities with [the] Troops, the Exertions of the Colonies, will procure a total Change of Measures and full Redress for us. However my Friend, I cannot, at this Distance pretend to judge. We must leave all to your Superiour Wisdom. What you propose, Sir, of holding out Some Proposal which shall shew our Willingness to pay for our Protection at Sea is a Subject, often mentioned in private Conversations here. Many Gentlemen have pursued the Thought, and digested their Plans. But what is to be the Fate of them I cant say. It is my opinion, Sir, that We do our full Proportion towards the Protection of the Empire, and towards the Support of the naval Power. To the Support of the Standing Army, We ought never to contribute voluntarily. A gentleman, put into my Hands a Plan, a few Days ago, for of- SEPTEMBER 27, 1774  fering to raise 200,000 £. St[erling] annually and to appropriate it to the maintenance of a Ship of War. But is not this Surrendering our Liberty? I have not Time however to discuss these Questions, at present. I hope to have the Pleasure of considering these Things in private Conversation. Mean Time, I pray God to direct assist and protect you, and all our Friends, amidst the Dangers that Surround you. Am glad to hear Mr. Cranch is about taking Refuge at Braintree. I wish every living Creature, except the Tories, was well provided for in the Country. My Respects to all your worthy Family.

102,dg001107,1774,John Adams Notes of Debates,"""John Adams' Notes of Debates   [September 28,1774] Mr. Galloway. The Proposal I intended to make having been opposed, I have waited to hear a more effectual one. A general Non Importation from G. Britain and Ireland has been adopted, but I think this will be too gradual in its Operation for the Relief of Boston. A General Non Exportation, I have ever looked on as an indigested Proposition. It is impossible America can exist, under a total Non Exportation. We in this Province should have tens of Thousands of People thrown upon the cold Hand of Charity. Our Ships would lie by the Walls, our Seamen would be thrown out of Bread, our Shipwrights &c. out of Employ and it would affect the landed Interest. It would weaken US in another Struggle which I fear is too near. To explain my Plan I must state a Number of facts relative to Great Britain, and relative to America. I hope no facts which I shall state will be disagreable. In the last War, America was in the greatest Danger of Destruction. This was held up by the Massa[chusetts] and by the Congress in 1754. They said We are disunited among ourselves. Their is no indifferent Arbiter between US. Requisitions came over. A No. of the Colonies gave most extensively and liberally, other[s] gave nothing, or late. Pensylvania gave nothing or late. Pensylvania gave late not for Want of Zeal or Loyalty, but owing to their Disputes, with Proprietors--their disunited State. These Delinquencies were handed up to the Parent State, and these gave Occasion to the Stamp Act. America with the greatest Reason and Justice complained of the Stamp Act. SEPTEMBER 28, 1774  Had they proposed some Plan of Policy--some Negociation but set afoot, it would have terminated in the most happy Harmony between the two Countries. They repealed the Stamp Act, but they passed the declaratory Act. Without some Supream Legislature, some common Arbiter, you are not, say they, part of the State. I am as much a friend of Liberty [as] exists--and No Man shall go further, in Point of Fortune, or in Point of Blood, than the Man who now addresses you. Burlamaqui, Grotius, Puffendorf, Hooker. There must be an Union of Wills and Strength. Distinction between a State and a Multi- tude. A State is animated by one Soul. As We are not within the Circle of the Supream Jurisdiction of the Parliament, We are independent States. The Law of Great Britain dont bind us in any Case whatever. We want the Aid and Assistance and Protection of the Arm of our Mother Country. Protection And Allegiance are reciprocal Duties. Can We lay claim to the Money and Protection of G. Britain upon any Principles of Honour or Conscience? Can We wish to become Aliens to the Mother State. We must come upon Terms with G. Britain. Some Gentlemen are not for Negociation. I wish I could hear some Reason against it. The Minister must be at 20, or 30 millions to inforce his Meas- ures. I propose this Proposition. The Plan. 2 Classes of Laws. 1. Laws of Internal Policy. 2. Laws in which more than one Colony were concerned, raising Money for War. No one Act can be done, without the Assent of Great Britain. No one without the Assent of America. A British American Legislature. Mr. Duane. As I mean to second this Motion, I think myself bound to lay before the Congress my Reasons. N. York thought it necessary to have a Congress for the Relief of Boston and Mass. And to do more, to lay a Plan for a lasting Accommodation with G. Brit ain. Whatever may have been the Motive for departing from the first Plan of the Congress, I am unhappy that We have departed from it. The Post Office Act was before the Year 1763. Can we expect lasting Tranquility. I have given my full Assent to a Non Im and Exportation Agreement. The Right of regulating Trade, from the local Circumstances of the Colonies, and their Disconnection with each other, cannot be exercised by the Colonies. Mass. disputed the Navigation Act, because not represented, but made a Law of their own, to inforce that Act.  Virginia did the same nearly. I think Justice requires that we should expressly ceed to Parlia- ment the Right of regulating Trade. In the Congress in 1754 which consisted of the greatest and best Men in the Colonies, this was considered as indispensable. A civil War with America, would involve a national Bankruptcy. Coll. Lee. How did We go on for 160 Years before the Year 1763? We flourished and grew. This Plan would make such Changes in the Legislatures of the Colonies that I could not agree to it, without consulting my Constituents. Mr. Jay. I am led to adopt this Plan. It is objected that this Plan will alter our Constitutions and therefore cannot be adopted without consulting Constituents. Does this Plan give up any one Liberty?--or interfere with any one Right. Mr. Henry. The original Constitution of the Colonies, was founded on the broadest and most generous Base. The Regulation of Our Trade, was Compensation enough for all the Protection we ever experienced from her. We shall liberate our Constituents from a corrupt House of Commons, but thro them into the Arms of an American Legislature that may be bribed by that Nation which avows in the Face of the World, that Bribery is a Part of her System of Government. Before We are obliged to pay Taxes as they do, let us be as free as they. Let us have our Trade open with all the World. We are not to consent by the Representatives of Representatives. I am inclined to think the present Measures lead to War. Mr. Ed. Rutledge. I came with an Idea of getting a Bill of Rights, and a Plan of permanent Relief. I think the Plan may be freed from almost every objection. I think it almost a perfect Plan. Mr. Galloway. In every Govennment, Patriarchal, Monarchical, Aristocratical or democratical, there must be a Supream Legislature. I know of no American Constitution. A Virginia Constitution, a Pensylvanian Constitution We have. We are totally independent of each other. Every Gentleman here thinks, that Parliament ought to have the Power over Trade, because Britain protects it and us. Why then will we not declare it. Because Parliament and Ministry is wicked, and corrupt and will take Advantage of such Declaration to tax us--and will also Reason from this Acknowledgment, to further Power over us. Answer. We shall not be bound further than We acknowledge it. Is it not necessary that the Trade of the Empire should be regulated by some Power or other? Can the Empire hold together, without  it. No. Who shall regulate it? Shall the Legislature of Nova Scotia, or Georgia, regulate it? Mass. or Virginia? Pensylvania or N. York. It cant be pretended. Our Legislative Powers extend no farther than the Limits of our Governments. Where then shall it be placed. There is a Necessity that an American Legislature should be set up, or else that We should give the Power to Parliament or King. Protection. Acquiescence. Mass. Virginia. Advantages derived from our Commerce. ""

105,dg001110,1774,Joseph Galloway s Statement on His Plan of Union,"""Joseph Galloway's Statement on His Plan of Union   [September 28, 1774] The Congress met at Philadelphia in September, 1774.(1) They brought with them their appointments and instructions. The latter plainly discover the dispositions of the assemblies, and of the people who gave them, and demonstrate their aversion to every thing which might tend to a seditious or illegal opposition to Government. They strictly enjoined their delegates to \""pursue proper, prudent, and lawful measures, and to adopt a plan for obtaining a redress of American grievances, ascertaining American rights upon the most solid and constitutional principles, and for establishing that union and harmony between Great Britain and the Colonies, which is indispensably necessary to the welfare and happiness of both.\"" Under these instructions, it was the general expectation that decent petitions would be presented to Parliament, explicitly pointing out the measures by which its authority over the Colonies might be rendered more constitutional, and the grievances complained of might be redressed; because this was nothing more than the reasonable duty of subjects, and it was the sincere wish of the people. Upon the meeting of Congress, two parties were immediately formed, with different views, and determined to act upon different principles. One intended candidly and clearly to define American rights, and explicitly and dutifully to petition for the remedy which would redress the grievances justly complained of--to form a more solid and constitutional union between the two countries, and to avoid every measure which tended to sedition, or acts of violent opposition. The other consisted of persons, whose design, from the beginning of their opposition to the Stamp Act, was to throw off all subordination and connexion with Great-Britain; who meant by every fiction, false hood and fraud, to delude the people from their due allegiance, to SEPTEMBER 28, 1774  throw the subsisting Governments into anarchy, to incite the ignorant and vulgar to arms, and with those arms to establish American Inde- pendence. The one were men of loyal principles, and possessed the greatest fortunes in America; the other were congregational and pres- byterian republicans, or men of bankrupt fortunes, overwhelmed in debt to the British merchants. The first suspected the designs of the last, and were therefore cautious; but as they meant to do nothing but what was reasonable and just, they were open and ingenuous. The second, fearing the opposition of the first, were secret and hypo critical, and left no art, no falsehood, no fraud unessayed to conceal their intentions. The loyalists rested, for the most part, on the defensive, and opposed, with success, every measure which tended to violent opposition. Motions were made, debated and rejected, and nothing was carried by either. While the two parties in Congress remained thus during three weeks on an equal balance, the republicans were calling to their as- sistance the aid of their factions without. Continual expresses were employed between Philadelphia and Boston. These were under the management of Samuel Adams--a man, who though by no means remarkable for brilliant abilities, yet is equal to most men in popular intrigue, and the management of a faction. He eats little, drinks little, sleeps little, thinks much, and is most decisive and indefatigable in the pursuit of his objects. It was this man, who by his superior application manage(l at once the faction in Congress at Philadelphia, and the factions in New England. Whatever these patriots in Congress wished to have done by their colleagues without, to induce General Gage, then at the head of his Majesty's army at Boston, to give them a pretext for violent opposition, or to promote their measures in Congress, Mr. Adams advised and directed to be done; and when done, it was dispatched by express to Congress. By one of these expresses came the inflammatory resolves of the county of Suffolk, which contained a complete declaration of war against Great-Britain. By these resolves it is declared, \""that no obedience is due to acts of Parliament affecting Boston:\"" That \""the justices of the superior courts of judicature, court of assize, &c. are unconstitutional officers, and that no regard ought to be paid to them by the people:\"" That \""the county will support and bear harmless all sheriffs and their deputies, constables, jurors and other officers, who shall refuse to carry into execution the orders of the said courts:\"" That \""the collectors of taxes, constables and other officers, retain in their hands all public monies, and not make any payment thereof to the provincial county treasurer:\"" And that \""the persons who had accepted seats at the council  board, by virtue of a mandamus from the King, should be considered as obstinate and incorrigible enemies to their country.\"" They advise the people \""to elect the officers of militia, and to use their utmost diligence to acquaint themselves with the art of war as soon as possible, and for that purpose to appear under arms once in every week:\"" And to carry these and other measures into execution; among many other things equally treasonable, they recommend it to the several towns to \""chuse a Provincial Congress.\"" Upon these resolves being read, a motion was made that the Congress should give them their sanction. Long and warm debates en sued between the parties. At this time the republican faction in Con- gress had provided a mob, ready to execute their secret orders. The cruel practice of tarring and feathering had been long since introduced. This lessened the firmness of some of the loyalists; the vote was put and carried. Two of the dissenting members presumed to offer their protest against it in writing, which was negatived. They next insisted that the tender of their protest and its negative should be entered on the minutes; this was also rejected. By this treasonable vote the foundation of military resistance throughout America was effectually laid. The example was now set by the people of Suffolk, and the measure was approved of by those who called themselves the representatives of all America. The loyal party, although they knew a great majority of the colonists were averse to the measure, perceived the improbability of stemming the torrent. They had no authority, no means in their own power to resist it; they saw those who held the powers of Government inactive spec- tators, and either shrinking from their duty, or uniting in the measures of sedition; they saw the flame of rebellion spreading with more rapidity in a province under the eye of his Majesty's army than in any other; and that no effectual measures were taking by Government in Britain to suppress it; and yet, as a petition to his Majesty had been ordered to be brought in, they resolved to continue their exertions. They hoped to prevail in stating the rights of America on just and constitutional principles; in proposing a plan for uniting the two countries on those principles, and in a clear, definitive and decent prayer, to ask for what a majority of the colonies wished to obtain; and as they had no reason to doubt the success of this measure in a British Parliament, they further hoped, that it would stop the effusion of blood and the ruin of their country. With this view, as well as to probe the ultimate design of the republicans, and to know with certainty whether any proposal, short of the absolute independence of the Colonies, would satisfy them, a plan of union was drawn by a member of the loyal party,(2) and approved by the rest. It was so formed as to leave no room for any rea-  sonable objection on the part of the republicans, if they meant to be united to Great Britain on any grounds whatever. It included a resto- ration of all their rights, and a redress of all their grievances, on con stitutional principles; and it accorded with all the instructions given to them as members of Congress. Introductory to his motion which led to this plan, the author of it made, in substance, the following speech, which is taken from his short notes: \""He told Congress that he came with instructions to pro pose some mode, by which the harmony between Great Britain and the Colonies might be restored on constitutional principles: that this appeared to be the genuine sense of all the instructions brought into Congress by the Delegates of the several Colonies. He had long wait ed with great patience under an expectation of hearing some proposition which should tend to that salutary and important purpose; but, to his great mortification and distress, a month had been spent in fruitless debates on equivocal and indecisive propositions, which tended to inflame rather than reconcile--to produce war instead of peace between the two countries. In this disagreeable situation of things he thought it his incumbent duty to speak plainly, and to give his sentiments without the least reserve. \""There are,\"" says he, \""two propositions before the Congress, for restoring the wished-for harmony: one, that Parliament should be requested to place the Colonies in the state they were in in the year 1763; the other, that a non-exporation and non-imporation agreement should be adopted. I will consider these propositions, and venture to reject them both; the first, as indecisive, tending to mislead both countries, and to lay a foundation for further discontent a quarrel; the other, as illegal, and ruinous to America. \""The first proposition is indecisive, because it points out no ground of complaint--asks for a restoration of no right, settles no principle, and proposes no plan for accommodating the dispute There is no statute which has been passed to tax or bind the Colonies since the year 1763, which was not founded on precedents and stat- utes of a similar nature before that period; and therefore the proposi- tion, while it expressly denies the right of Parliament, confesses it by the strongest implication. In short, it is nugatory, and without meaning; and however it may serve, when rejected by Parliament, as it certainly will be, to form a charge of injustice upon, and to deceive and inflame the minds of the people hereafter, it cannot possibly answer any other purpose. \""The second proposition is undutiful and illegal: it is an insult on the supreme authority of the State; it cannot fail to draw on the Colonies the united resentment of the Mother Country. If we will not trade with Great Britain, she will not suffer us to trade at all. Our ports will be blocked up by British men of war, and troops will be  sent to reduce us to reason and obedience. A total and sudden stag nation of commerce is what no country can bear: it must bring ruin on the Colonies; the produce of labour must perish on their hands, and not only the progress of industry be stopped, but industry and labour will cease, and the country itself be thrown into anarchy and tumult. I must therefore reject both the propositions; the first as indecisive and the other as inadmissible upon any principle of prudence or policy, If we sincerely mean to accommodate the difference between the two countries and to establish their union on more firm and constitutional principles, we must take into consideration a number of facts which led the Parliament to pass the acts complained of, since the year 1763, and the real state of the Colonies. A clear and perfect knowledge of these matters only can lead us to the ground of substan- tial redress and permanent harmony. I will therefore call your recol- lection to the dangerous situation of the Colonies from the intrigues of France, and the incursions of the Canadians and their Indian allies at the commencement of the last war. None of us can be ignorant of the just sense they then entertained of that danger, and of their incapacity to defend themselves against it, nor of the supplicaions made to the Parent State for its assistance, nor of the cheerfulness with which Great Britain sent over her fleets and armies for their protection, of the millions she expended in that protection, and of the happy consequences which attended it. In this state of the Colonies, it was not unreasonable to expect that Parliament would have levied a tax on them proportionate to their wealth, and the sums raised in Great Britain. Her ancient right, so often exercised, and never controverted, enabled her, and the occasion invited her, to do it. And yet, not knowing their wealth, a generous tenderness arising from the fear of doing them injustice, induced Parliament to forbear to levy aids upon them--It left the Colonies to do justice to themselves and to the nation. And moreover, in order to allure them to a discharge of their duty, it offered to reimburse those Colonies which should generously grant the aids that were necessary to their own safety. But what was the conduct of the Colonies on this occasion, in which their own existence was immediately concerned? However painful it may be for me to repeat, or you to hear, l must remind you of it. You all know there were Colonies which at some times granted liberal aids, and at others nothing; other Colonies gave nothing during the war; none gave equitably in proportion to their wealth, and all that did give were actuated by partial and self-interested motives, and gave only in proportion to the approach or remoteness of the danger. These delinquencies were occasioned by the want of the exercise of some supreme power to ascertain, with equity, their proportions of aids, and to over-rule the par-  ticular passions, prejudices, and interests, of the several Colonies. \""To remedy these mischiefs, Parliament was naturally led to exercise the power which had been, by its predecessors, so often exer- cised over the Colonies, and to pass the Stamp Act. Against this act the Colonies petitioned Parliament, and denied its authority. Instead of proposing some remedy, by which that authority should be rendered more equitable and more constitutional over the Colonies, the petitions rested in a declaration that the Colonies could not be represented in that body. This justly alarmed the British Senate.(3)It was thought and called by the ablest men and Britain, a clear and explicit declaration of American Independence, and compelled the Parliament to pass the Declaratory Act, in order to save its ancient and in controvertible right of supremacy over all the parts of the empire. By this injudicious step the cause of our complaints became fixed, and instead of obtaining a constitutional reformation of the authority of Parliament over the Colonies, it brought on an explicit declaration of a right in Parliament to exercise absolute and unparticipated power over them. Nothing now can be wanting to convince us, that the Assemblies have pursued measures which have produced no relief, and answered no purpose but a bad one. I therefore hope that the collect ed wisdom of Congress will perceive and avoid former mistakes; that they will candidly and thoroughly examine the real merits of Our dispute with the Mother Country, and take such ground as shall firmly unite us under one system of polity, and make us one people. \""In order to establish those principles, upon which alone American relief ought, in reason and policy, to be founded, I will take a brief view of the arguments on both sides of the great question be tween the two countries--a question in its magnitude and importance exceeded by none that has been ever agitated in the councils of any nation. The advocates for the supremacy of Parliament over the Colonies contend, that there must be one supreme legislative head in every civil society, whose authority must extend to the regulation and final decision of every matter susceptible of human direction; and that every member of the society, whether political, official, or individual, must be subordinate to its supreme will, signified in its laws: that this supremacy and subordination are essential in the constitution of all States, whatever may be their forms; that no society ever did, or could exist, without it; and that these truths are solidly established in the practice of all Governments, and confirmed by the concurrent authority of all writers on the subject of civil society. \""These advocates also assert, what we cannot deny--That the discovery of the Colonies was made under a commission granted by the supreme authority of the British State, that they have been settled under that authority, and therefore are truly the property of that State. Parliamentary jurisdiction has been constantly exercised over  them from their first settlement; its executive authority has ever run through all their inferior political systems: the Colonists have ever sworn allegiance to the British State, and have been considered, both by the State and by themselves, as subjects of the British Government. Protection and allegiance are reciprocal duties; the one cannot exist without the other. The Colonies cannot claim the protection of Britain upon any principle of reason or law, while they deny its supreme authority. Upon this ground the authority of Parliament stands too firm to be shaken by any arguments whatever; and therefore to deny that authority, and at the same time to declare their incapacity to be represented, amounts to a full and explicit declaration of independence. \""In regard to the political state of the Colonies, you must know that they are so many inferior societies, disunited and unconnected in polity. That while they deny the authority of Parliament, they are, in respect to each other, in a perfect state of nature, destitute of any supreme direction or decision whatever, and incompetent to the grant of national aids, or any other general measure whatever, even to the settlement of differences among themselves. This they have repeatedly acknowledged, and particularly by their delegates in Congress in the beginning of the last war; and the aids granted by them since that period, for their own protection, are a proof of the truth of that acknowledgment. \""You also know that the seeds of discord are plentifully sowed in the constitution of the Colonies; that they are already grown to maturity, and have more than once broke out into open hostilities. They are at this moment only suppressed by the authority of the Parent State; and should that authority be weakened or annulled, many subjects of unsettled disputes, and which, in that case, can only be settled by an appeal to the sword, must involve us in all the horrors of civil war. You will now consider whether you wish to be destitute of the protection of Great Britain, or to see a renewal of the claims of France upon America; or to remain in our present disunited state, the weak exposed to the force of the strong. I am sure no honest man can entertain wishes so ruinous to his country. \""Having thus briefly stated the arguments in favour of parlimentary authority, and considered the state of the Colonies, I am free to confess that the exercise of that authority is not perfectly constitutional in respect to the Colonies. We know that the whole landed interest of Britain is represented in that body, while neither the land nor the people of America hold the least participation in the legislative authority of the State. Representation, or a participation in the supreme councils of the State, is the great principle upon which the freedom of the British Government is established and secured. I also acknowledge, that that territory whose people have no enjoyment of  this privilege, are subject to an authority unrestrained and absolute; and if the liberty of the subject were not essentially concerned in it, I should reject a distinction so odious between members of the same state, so long as it shall be continued. I wish to see it exploded, and the right to participate in the supreme councils of the State extended, in some form, not only to America, but to all the British dominions; otherwise I fear that profound and excellent fabrick of civil polity will, ere long, crumble to pieces. \""The case of the Colonies is not a new one. It was formerly the very situation of Wales, Durham, and Chester. \""As to the tax, it is neither unjust nor oppressive, it being rather a relief than a burthen; but it is want of constitutional principle in the authority that passed it, which is the ground for complaint. This, and this only, is the source of American grievances. Here, and here only, is the defect; and if this defect were removed, a foundation would be laid for the relief of every American complaint; the obnoxious statutes would of course be repealed, and others would be made, with the assent of the Colonies, to answer the same and better purposes; the mischiefs arising from the disunion of the Colonies would be removed; their freedom would be established, and their subordination fixed on solid constitutional principles. \""Desirous as I am to promote the freedom of the Colonies, and to prevent the mischiefs which will attend a military contest with Great Britain, I must intreat you to desert the measures which have been so injudiciously and ineffectually pursued by antecedent Assemblies.(4) Let us thoroughly investigate the subject matter in dispute, and endeavour to find from that investigation the means of perfect and permanent redress. In whatever we do, let us be particular and explicit, and not wander in general allegations. These will lead 115 to no point, nor can produce any relief; they are besides dishonourable and insidious. I would therefore acknowledge the necessity of the supreme authority of Parliament over the Colonies, because it is a proposition which we cannot deny without manifest contradiction, while we Confess that we are subjects of the British Government; and if we do not approve of a representation in Parliament, let 115 ask for a participation in the freedom and power of the English constitution in some other mode of incorporation; for I am convinced, by long attention to the subject, that let us deliberate, and try what other expedients we may, we shall find none that can give to the Colonies substantial freedom, but some such incorporation. I therefore beseech you, by the respect you are bound to pay to the instructions of your constituents, by the regard you have for the honour and safety of your country, and as you wish to avoid a war with Great Britain, which must terminate, at all events, in the ruin of America, not to rely on a denial of the authority of Parliament, a refusal to be represented, and   non-importation agreement; because whatever protestations, in that case, may be made to the contrary, it will prove to the world, that we intend to throw off our allegiance to the State, and to involve the two countries in all the horrors of a civil war. \""With a view to promote the measure I have so earnestly recommended, I have prepared the draught of a plan for uniting America more intimately, in constitutional polity, with Great Britain. It contains the great outlines or principles only, and will require many additions in case those should be approved. I am certain, when dispas- sionately considered, it will be found to be the most perfect union in power and liberty with the Parent State, next to a representation in Parliament, and I trust it will be approved of by both countries. In forming it, I have been particularly attentive to the rights of both; and I am confident that no American, who wishes to continue a subject of the British State which is what we all uniformly profess, can offer any reasonable objection against it. \""I shall not enter into a further explanation of its principles, but shall reserve my sentiments until the second reading, with which I hope it will be favoured.\"" The introductory motion being seconded, the Plan was presented and read. Warm and long debates immediately ensued on the question, Whether it should be entered in the proceedings of Congress, or be referred to further consideration. All the men of property, and most of the ablest speakers, supported the motion, while the republican party strenuously opposed it. The question was at length carried by a majority of one Colony.

It calls up to my View the anxious, distress'd State you must be in, amidst the Confusions and Dangers, which surround you. I long to return, and administer all the Consolation in my Power, but when I shall have accomplished all the Business I have to do here, I know not, and if it should be necessary to stay here till Christmas, or longer, in order to effect our Purposes, I am determined patiently to wait. Patience, Forbearance, Long Suffering, are the Lessons taught here for our Province, and at the same Time absolute and open Resistance to the new Government. I wish I could convince Gentlemen of the Danger, or Impracticability of this as fully as I believe it myself. The Art and Address, of Ambassadors from a dozen belligerant Powers of Europe, nay of a Conclave of Cardinals at the Election of a Pope, or of the Princes in Germany at the Choice of an Emperor, would not exceed the Specimens We have seen. Yet the Congress all profess the same political Principles. They all profess to consider our Province as suffering in the common Cause, and indeed they seem to feel for Us, as if for themselves We have had as great Questions to discuss as ever engaged the Attention of Men, and an infinite Multitude of them. I received a very kind Letter from Deacon Palmer, acquainting m with Mr. Cranch's designs of removing to Braintree, which I approv very much--and wish I had an House for every Family in Boston and Abilities to provide for them, in the Country. l submit it to you, my Dear, whether it would not be best to re move all the Books and Papers and Furniture in the Office at Boston up to Braintree. There will be no Business there nor any where, suppose, and my young Friends can study there better than in Boston at present. I shall be kill'd with Kindness, in this Place. We go to congress at SEPTEMBER 29, 1774  Nine, and there We stay, most earnestly engaged in Debates upon the most abstruse Misteries of State untill three in the Afternoon, then We adjourn, and go to Dinner with some of the Nobles of Pensylvania, at four O Clock and feast upon ten thousand Delicacies, and sitt drinking Madeira, Claret and Burgundy till six or seven, and then go home, fatigued to death with Business, Company, and Care. (1) Yet I hold it out, surprizingly. I drink no Cyder, but feast upon Phyladelphia Beer, and Porter. A Gentleman, one Mr. Hare, has lately set Up in this City a Manufactory of Porter, as good as any that comes from London. I pray We may introduce it into the Massachusetts. It agrees with me, infinitely better than Punch, Wine, or Cyder, or any other Spirituous Liquor. My Love to my dear Children one by one. My Compliments to Mr. Thaxter, and Rice and every Body else.

108,dg001113,1774,John Adams to William Tudor,"""John Adams to William Tudor   Dear Sir, Philadelphia Septr. 29. 1774. I wish it was in my Power, to write you any Thing for the Relief of our Anxiety, under the Pressure of those Calamities which now distress our beloved Town of Boston and Province of Massachusetts. The Sentiments expressed in your last to me, are Such as would do honour to the best of Citizens, in the Minds of the Virtuous and worthy of any Age or Country in the worst of Times. Dulce et decorum est pro Patria mori. Wouldst thou receive thy Countrys loud Applause, Lov'd as her Father, as her God ador'd, Be thou the bold Asserter of her Cause, Her Voice in Council, in the Fight her Sword. You can have no adequate Idea of the Pleasures or of the Difficulties of the Errand I am now upon. The Congress is Such an Assembly as never before came together on a Sudden, in any Part of the World. Here are Fortunes, Abilities, Learning, Eloquence, Acuteness equal to any 1 ever met with my Life. Here is a Diversity of Religions, Educations, Manners, Interests, Such as it would Seem almost impossible to unite in any one Plan of Conduct. Every Question is discussed with a Moderation, and an Acuteness and a minuteness equal to that of Queen Elizabeths privy Council. SEPTEMBER 29, 1774  This occasions infinite Delays. We are under obligations of Secrecy in every Thing except the Single Vote which you have Seen approving the Resolutions of the County of Suffolk. What Effect this Vote may have with you is uncertain. What you will do, God knows. You Say you look up to the Congress. It is well you Should: but I hope you will not expect too much from Us. The Delegates here are not Sufficiently acquainted with our Pr[ovince] and with the Circumstances you are in, to form a Judgment [of] what Course it is proper for you to take. They Start at one Thought of taking up the old Charter. They Shudder at the Prospect of Blood. Yet they are unanimously and unalterably against your Submission, to any of the Acts for a Single Moment. You See by this What they are for--vizt, that you Stand Stock Still, and live without Government, or Law. At least for the present and as long as you can. I have represented to them, whenever I see them, the Utter Impossibility, of four hundred Thousand People existing long with [ou]t a Legislature or Courts of Justice. They all Seem to acknowledge it: Yet nothing can be as yet accomplished. We hear, perpetually, the most figurative Panegyricks upon our Wisdom Fortitude and Temperance: The most fervent Exhortations to perseverance, But nothing more is done. I may venture to tell you, that I believe We Shall agree to N. Imp., N. Consumption, and Non Exportation, but not to commence so soon as I could wish. Indeed all this would be insufficient, for our Purpose--a more adequate Support, and Relief to the Massachusetts Should be adopted --But I tremble for fear, We should fail of obtaining it. There is however a most laudable Zeal, and an excellent Spirit, which every Day increases, especially in this City. The Quakers had a General Meeting here last Sunday, and are deeply affected with the Complexion of the Times. They have recommended it to all their People to renounce Tea, and indeed the People of this City of all De nominations have laid it generally aside Since our Arrival here. The are about Setting up Companys of Cadets, voluntarily. &c &c &c. It is the universal opinion here that the General, Gage, is in t Horrors, and that he means only to act upon the Defensive. Ho well this opinion is founded you, can judge better than I. I must beseech you to Shew this Letter to no Man, in whom you have not the most perfect Confidence. It may do a great deal of Mischief. We have had numberless Prejudices to remove here. We ha been obliged to act, with great Delicacy and Caution. We have been obliged to keep ourselves out of Sight, and to feel Pulses, and Sound the Depths--to insinuate our Sentiments, Designs and Desires b means of other Persons, Sometimes of one Province and Sometime SEPTEMBER 30, 1774  of another--a future opportunity I hope in Conversations will make you acquainted with all.

Mr. Duane in support of his first Motion that he is not for Warr, nor are his people. Mr. Rutledge again to Order. Mr. Pendleton declares it to be in Order but that it is exceptionable and proposes it to be amended. Mr. Rutledge junr. against it. Col Dyar for it at large. Mr. Low against it. Col. Bland against it. Mr. Henry again lengthy & zealous for it. Mr. Hooper against it as a most impolitic measure at this Time & if pursued will defeat its design. North Carolina has a Militia Law. South Carolina also has such a Law. Virginia has had one for a Cen- tury, but N. Carolinas is a Temporary one pass'd at the express desire of the Governor. General Gage is now beseiged, & is dependant on our Lenity. That N. Carolina is able to defend itself. Mr. Duane again. Mr. Lynch for it and Lengthy says We have already adopted much the same thing--That all Europe can not subdue it, &c but proposes a different Bill which Col. Lee agrees to. Mr. Jay says he would be for it were it as innocent as it is wise. Col. Bland against it. The Motion was again altered & amended and the Question being put was carried Unanimously.(2) Mr. Lynch moved respecting the Regulations of Trade or Acts of Charles the Second should be considered as obligatory.

118,dg001123,1774,Richard Henry Lee s Proposed Resolution,"""Richard Henry Lee's Proposed Resolution   [October 3, 1774] (1) Resolved That as we find the reason declared in the preamble to the Acts of Parliament for raising a Revenue in America to be for \""suporting the Civil Government Administration of Justice and for protecting defending and securing\"" the Colonies, The Congress recommend it to the Colonies where it is not already done, to provide a constitutional honorable, and compitent support for the purposes of Government and Administration of Justice. And since it is quite unreasonable that the Mother Country should be at the expence of maintaining Standing Armies in North America for its defence and that Administration may be convinced that this is unnecessary and improper as North America is able, willing, and under Providence determined to Protect Defend and Secure itself, The Congress do most earnestly recommend it to the several Colonies that a Militia be forthwith appointed and well disciplined And that they be well provided with Ammunition and Proper Arms.

We should with Pleasure have communicated to you the Proceedings of the Congress from Time to Time, but the Resolution to let Nothing transpire without express Direction would not admit it; but we may with Propriety, we believe, observe that from the Resolutions unanimously come into by the Congress upon the Resolves of the County of Suffolk, which were immediately published with those Resolves, some Estimate may be formed of the general Sentiments of the Congress. We take this early Opportunity of acquainting Your Honor,(1) that a Non-Importation from Great-Britain and Ireland is agreed upon, to take Place the first Day of December next, and a general Non-Exportation on the tenth Day of September next. Non-Exportation of several Commodities to different Parts, to commence immediately or very soon, is under Consideration, and we think will probably be resolved upon. Whenever any Measures are adopted, the Communication of which will either give Pleasure to the Colony, or promote its Interest, we shall (the Moment we are at Liberty) give you the earliest Intelli- gence of them. The Magnitude of the Subjects before the Congress, the peculiar Circumstances of Delicacy and Intricacy in which they are involved, the Danger of taking a false Step in a Matter of such vast Importance, and the Necessity of adopting of every proper Measure, cannot fail to lengthen the Session. What has been done we hope will be honoured with the Approbation of the Colony. Much still remains to be done, and however striking the Ideas of our Friends and Connexions at Home may be after a long Absence, we shall chearfully continue here as long as the Service of our Country requires it, and we hope faithfully to exert our utmost Endeavours in this arduous Undertaking for the common Good of America. We are, with great Regard Your Honor's most obedient, and most humble Servants. Sam. Ward P.S.

I have communicated your several Agreable Letters to the Farmer (1) & his Lady, to Mr Mifflin & Mr Thompson and their Ladies & others, they all are extreamly pleased with them & admire them for the patriotic, calm & undaunted spirit they breath.

That the Regulations, of Trade, for the present ought to be pass'd over. It is better for the present to Temporize. Col. Dyer, for altering the Motion--but appears very confused. Maj. Sullivan, that the Motion is not sufficiently explicit but that We ought to Speak out. Proposes an amendment. Mr. Lynch against the whole Clause, as 1763 will leave some of the worst Acts in force --the Rice being enumerated--The Hatt Act--The Act for extending Land in America to the payment of Debts--The Act of Wm & Mary, & the 5th of George 2d. extend the power of jurisdictn. of Admiralty invidiously. The Greivance of the Crown appointing Councellors to act as Legislators, in the respective Colonies, are he says all of them Greivances to be remonstrated against. Mr. Adams jun. for the Motion. Says it does not imply, that We are to submit to all preceeding Acts--but that We shall by such re peal be in the State We were in in 1763 as to harmony. Mr. Low complains, that the Motion is not sufficiently explicit, that We ought to speakout, complains of being misapprehended, &, of being in a suspicious point of Light. Col. Lee answers, and is at large for the Motion. Col. Dyer again, (quite on one side of the Question) . Mr. Adams senr. for the Amendment in part but proposes another. Mr. Cushing strangely against it. Mr. Lynch for it. Mr. Jay, for the last amendment to appearance at first, but finally means to confound every thing. Mr. Henry answers him and is severe on Mr. Jay. Mr. Rutlidge senr. against the Whole of the Motion, & thinks it ought to be totally rejected as Admiralty Courts were extended be fore the Year 1763, which are the most enormous of any Whatever, and that he will never be easy while that extension remains as it in effect is destroying all privileges in the destruction of Trial by Juries. Mr. Henry & Mr. Rutledge dispute about the meaning of an Act of Parliament. Mr. Cushing in support of his Motion. Mr. Mifflin in support of the same. Mr. Jay Up against the Motion. Mr. Sherman, Up on Acct. of taking up the Greivances at large, & dropping the Motion. Mr. Read explains himself as to some Expressions in his Speech. Mr. Johnson, lengthy & in favor of the Motion. Col. Lee makes a New Motion for an Amendment in the Instructions to the Committee--reads it and it is seconded.  Mr. Payne, rather against the Motion, that We should be more explicit. Mr. Low joins him. Mr. Cushing, rather severe on the subject against New York. Mr. Low answers him. Mr. Adams, senr. replies. Question call'd for. Mr. Jay rises to make Observations, and To Slip it by, asserting that the Amendmt. was just the same as the Motion. Col. Lee very severe & lengthy in his Reply. Mr. Rutledge jr., makes a New Motion and gets it seconded by Mr. Jay. Mr. Chace, prefers the first amendment--but is for forming Resolutions against all Acts of Parliament, & then to propose modes of Opposition . Mr. Biddle, against being confined to the Year 1763. Mr. Duane against including the Canada Bill in the Petition to the King. Col. Lee answers him respecting the Canada Bill. Mr. Lynch, in answer to Mr. Chace.

Mr. Galloway against the Motion, unless other Articles are Now enumerated otherways it will not be a fair Method of proceeding. Mr. Mifflin, says it is proper We first should say what Articles ought, or are Necessary to be prohibited. Mr. Adams up again. Majr. Sullivan against stopping the Article of Lumber. Mr. Mifflin observes that Boards are as good for the Shipping of Sugar as Staves by making Boxes. Col. Lee thinks that it is best to let, the Non Exp[ortatio]n agreement will be rested best on the general footing on Which it Now stands (viz) on the first of Sepr. next. Gov. Ward speaking for it. Col.

Indies, in Plantations & Debts, Amounts to Many millions Stg., all of which will be Either Tottally Lost, or greatly Reduced by a Suspension of our Trade with them. 3. Stopping the Exportation of Flaxseed to Ireland will Ruin the Irish Linnen Manufacture Which Employs more than 500,000 Per sons for all the Wisdom of Engld. & Ireland United cant Sow the flax Lands of Ireland without the American Seed, of which the Annual Exportation is abt. 34000 hhds of 7 bushels Each, which Sowes abt. 100,000 Acres of Flax. We have advice that the whole of the Last Years Seed is Sold there, Very Small Supplyes can be obtain'd from Holland or Else Where, & that little very unfit for Sowing the Land, but allowing that Seed might be obtain'd Sufficient to Sow one third of their Lands (which I apprehend far beyound the Truth) in that case they must dismiss above 300,000 People from Employment, & of course put them on Immediate Starving, or making their way as they can to all the Granaries of Provisions within their Reach, for a Starving Multitude cant be Quieted but by feeding or killing them. These distresses will light on Ireland first, but they will Soon Reach OCTOBER 5, 1774  England, for the funds or Stock which Support the Irish Linnen Manufacture Lie principly in England. Half the Linen Manufacturd. in Ireland is due to the merchants in England before it is made, & very many people in England & many members of the Brittish Parliamt. own Estates in Ireland, & of Course must Immediately feel these Effects, & not the Immediate Effects only, but more distant ones also for the merchts. will not be able to Supply their Customers in foreign Markets, which must of Course be Supplyd. by the Dutch & French, & thereby Turn the Channel of that Commerce into those foreign hands, which the English have been these thirty Years past Struggling to Wrest from them, & which will not be Easily Recoverd. if it Shod. ever be Lost. The Same may be Observd. of the Sugar Trade, for the French, Dutch, Spaniards & Portuguese will Immediately Supply those foreign Markets, which have hitherto Received the English Exports. And as there is a great, tho not always visible Connexion between all the Several Branches of Trade in any Nation, 'tis Impossible to determine how far an obstruction of those great Branches, may Affect all the Rest, and as the Publick Funds of the English Nation are most Intimately connected with its Commerce, no one can foresee how far they may be Affected by Such grand Obstructions over & above the Immediate Reduction of one Tenth Part of the National Revenue. I humbly propose that these great Suspensions of our Trade be Seriously & early adopted, with a firm Resolution to Continue them forever If the B. P. Refuse to repeal all Sd. Acts, for I am clearly of opinion, that it is far better for English America to be forever deprived of those great Branches of Trade, than Submit to the Endless Miseries & Curses of a foreign Legislation but I cant think there is any danger that a Repeal of Sd. Acts will be delay'd after the B. P. are made acquainted with these Resolutions of America for if the Obstinate madness of a headstrong Ministry Shod. be persevering, yet the combind. force of the Starving Manufacturers of Ireland & Engd., the distresses of the Irish & West India Merchts. who must be breaking not here & there a house, but by Whole Streets at a time, & the distracted State of the Publick funds, will all conspire so strongly to Remove the fatal Evil, that no Influence of any Ministry can withstand the Argument. They can indeed have no time to deliberate for If the Acts are not repeal'd time eno for advice to Reach America by the Middle of next Feby, it will be Impossible to Convey the American Flaxseed to Ireland in Season for the Next Seed time & So the Irish Linen Manufacture must be ruind. or at Least Suspended for one year, & the Distresses of the W. Indies will soon be Infinite & Ruinous, if not releived Speedily by Supplys from N. America, but if these Measures Shod. not produce an Immediate Repeal I dare Say the accumulating distresses of a Little time will bring the Parliamt. to  their senses & Most Effectually do the business. Indeed I freely con fess I cannot beleive that the Whole Senate of G. B. can possibly In curr the Ruin of the Nation & Sacrifice the Most Important Intrests of it, to a Wretched Parliamentary Pride in Supporting a few acts of their own Which no one of them can pretend to Justify on the principles of Justice or Policy, & which Every Individual of them is heartily sorry were Ever Enacted. But it may be objected that 'tis Cruel, to distress the Manufacturers of Ireland & G. Brittain, & the Creoles & Negroes of the W. Indies, who have not injured us. I answer, I Propose to Supply the W. Indies with Every necessary, Except Staves, heading & hoops 'till the first of Decr. Next, 'till which time Neither they Nor the English or Irish Manufacturers will Suffer from our Resolutions, & Then it will be with the B. P. to Say how Long they Shall Suffer, or whither Any at all, So if there is any Cruelty in the case, it will Lie at their door &c not at ours. I will Just add a Word or two on the Sufferings of the Americans themselves from these Measures, which I think Not Quite Intollerable, & may be Reduced Principly to the following heads 1. They will Suffer themselves to grow Rich by a Disuse of the fopperies & Superlluities Imported from G. Brittain, none of which are of Essential use, & most of which much worse than Nothing. 2. They will Suffer themselves to grow wise & virtuous & healthy by a disuse of the Intoxicating Poisons & needless Luxuries Imported from the W. Indies, for I am Clearly of Opinion tho' Some things Imported from G. B. & the W. Indies may be calld. usefull, yet Taking all our Importations together, it wd. be better for America to pay for them all, & then Sink them, than to bring them ashore, & use them in the way that is become Customary. 3. They will Suffer themselves to grow Ingenious & Industrious in Manufacturing their own Necessaries, of which they have Raw Materials Eno. 4. The American Merchts. will Suffer themselves to grow Rich by Purchasing Raw Materials & Setting people to manufacture them, for the Merchts. will get much more Trade & more profit in this way, than by Importing the Manufacture ready finishd. 5. The Farmers who Raise flaxseed, few of whom Raise more than half a Doz bushels, must Suffer Indeed the Loss of Perhaps one third, or one half its Value by keeping it at home, for it is worth Something to feed cattle or to Make oyl, & for this Loss they are to be paid in the Liberties of themselves & their Posterity, which I think is no bad bargain. 6. But Whatever the Americans may Suffer, it is very Evident their Sufferings will be much Less by Resolutions that will force a speedy & Total Redress of our Grievances, than by Weak, Puny & Partial Resolutions, whose operation will be Slow, & Effects Doubt  full. America Ought not to Leave it Problematicall whether they will Ever put Up with the Loss of their Liberties or not. When our Impor- tant all is in Question, to use Weak & doubtfull Argts. is to give up the Cause or at Least to Weaken the Confidence of all our friends & add Great Sp[iri]t to our Enemies, whereas on the other hand Measures Sufficiently Spirited & Extensive, will discourage & dishearten the Proudest of our Oppressors, & Strengthen the hearts of our Suffering Brethern in Boston on Whose Resolution & Perseverance, the great cause of American Liberty much Depends, for if they Shd. Yeild the point, I dont know where the Next Stand might be Expected to be made. ""

Am much obliged for the seasonable hint you have given respecting masts. I should gladly give you an account of our proceedings but am under an obligation of Secrecy. Except with respect to the general non Importa- tion & non Exportation the former to take place on the first of De cember next, the latter in September following.(1) We have selected those Acts which we determine to have a Repeal of or forever restrain our trade from Great Britain, Ireland & the West Indies; among which Acts is the Canada Bill,(2) in my opinion the most dangerous to American Liberties among the whole train; for when we reflect on the dangerous situation the Colonies were in at the commencement of the Late War with a number of those Canadians on their backs who were assisted by Powerful Indian Nations determined to extirpate the Race of Protestants from America to make way for their own Cursed Religion so Dangerous to the State & favorable to Despotism, & contemplate that by the late Act their Territory is so far extended as to include by far the greater part of North America: that this will be a city of refuge for Roman Catholicks who will ever appear in favor of the Prerogative of the Crown backed by an abandoned Minister, aided by the whole force of Great Britain & assisted by the same Indian Nations, we must suppose our Situation to be Infinitely more Dangerous now than it was then, for while we are engaged with the Canadians on our Frontiers our Seaports must yield to the Ministerial fleet & army & if they once prevail no man must expect safety until he professes that Holy Religion which our Sovereign has been pleased to establish. I am certain that two Gods may as well exist in the universe as those two Religions where the Papists have power to extirpate the professors of the other. We can easily discover the designs of the Act & are determined to Counteract it at all events.

I shudder at the thought of the Blood which will be spilled, and would be glad to avoid it. Mr. Pendleton. How is the Purchaser to know whether the Molosses, Sugar, or Coffee, has paid the Duty or not? It cant be known. Shant we by this hang out to all the World our Intentions to smuggle? Don't We complain of these Acts as Grievances, and shant we insist on the Repeal. But this will give an Advantage to the West Indians and will make it their Interest to oppose our obtaining Redress. Coll. Dyer. This Subject as every Part of our Deliberations are important. The Q[uestion] is how far to extend the Non Importation of dutiable Articles. Mr. Chace. I am against the Question before you. What are the Ways and Means of obtaining Redress. In the manner it is penn'd it would not answer the End. How shall the Buyer know whether the Duties have been paid or not. Our Enemies will think that We mean to strike at the Right of Parliament to lay duties for the Regulation of Trade. I am one of those who hold the Position, that Parliament has a Right to make Laws for us in some Cases, to regulate the Trade-and in all Cases where the good of the whole Empire requires it. My Fears were up when We went into the Consideration of a Bill of Rights. I was afraid We should say too little or too much. It is said this is not a Non Importation Resolution. But it is, for there is no Importation of goods but according to the Law of the Land. Mr. Linch. I came here to get Redress of Grievances and to adopt every Means for that End, which could be adopted with a good Conscience OCTOBER 6, 1774  In my Idea Parliament has no Power to regulate Trade. But these Duties are all for Revenue not for Regulation of Trade. Many Gentlemen in this Room know how to bring in Goods, sugars and others, without paying Duties. Will any Gentleman say he will never purchase any Goods untill he is sure, that they were not smuggled. Mr. Mifflin. We shall Agree I suppose, to a Non Exportation of Lumber to the West Indies. They cannot send their Sugars to Eng land, nor to America. Therefore they cant be benefited. Mr. Low. Gentlemen have been transported by their Zeal, into Reflections upon an order of Men who deserve it the least of any Men in the Community. We ought not to deny the just Rights of our Mother Country. We have too much Reason in this Congress, to suspect that Independency is aimed at. I am for a Resolution against any Tea, Dutch as well as English. [We] ought to consider the Consequences possible as well as [pro] bable of every Resolution We take and provide ourselves [wit] h a Retreat or Resource. [Wha] t would be the Consequence of an Adjournment of the [Con] gress for 6 months? or a Recommendation of a [new?] Election of another to meet at the End of 6 Months? [Is it?] possible they may make it criminal, as Treason, [Mi]sprision of Treason, or Felony or a Praemunire? [Bo]th in the Assemblies who choose and in the Mem [ber] s who shall accept the Trust. [Wou] Id the assemblies or Members be intimidated? [Wou] ld they regard such an Act?(2) Will, Can the People bear a total Interruption of the [We]st India Trade? Can [they] live without Rum, Sugar, and [Mo]lasses? Will not their Impatience, and Vexation defeat the [Me] asure? [Thi]s would cutt up the Revenue by the Roots--if Wine, Fruit, [M] molasses and Sugar, were discarded, as well as Tea. But, a Prohibition of all Exports to the West Indies, will annihilate the Fishery--because, that cannot afford to loose the West India Fish--and this would throw a Multitude of Families in our fishing Towns into the Arms of Famine.

I have advised you before to remove my Office from Boston to Braintree. It is now, I think absolutely necessary. Let the best Care be taken of all Books and Papers. Tell all my Clerks to mind their Books, and study hard--for their Country will stand in need of able Councillors. I must give you a general Licence to make my Compliments to all my Friends and Acquaintances: I have not Time to name them particularly. I wish they would all write to me--if they leave Letters at Edes and Gills, they will soon be sent to me. I long to be at home, but I cannot say when. I will never leave the Congress, untill it rises, and when it will rise, I cannot say. And in deed I cannot say but We are better here than any where. We have fine Opportunities here to serve Boston and Massachusetts, by acquainting the whole Continent with the true State of them. Our Residence here greatly serves the Cause. The Spirit and Principles of Liberty, here, are greatly cherished, by our Presence and Conversation. The Elections of the last Week in this City, prove this. Mr. Dickenson was chosen almost unanimously a Representative of the County. The Broadbrims (3) began an opposition to your Friend Mr. Mifflin, because he was too warm in the Cause. This instantly alarmed the Friends of Liberty and ended in the Election of Mr. Mifflin, by Eleven hundred Votes out of Thirteen, and in the Election of our Secretary Mr. Charles Thompson to be a Burgess with him. This is considered here as a most compleat and decisive Victory in favour of the American Cause. And it [is] said it will change the Ballance in the Legislature here against Mr. Galloway who has been supposed to sit on the Skirts of the American Advocates.(4) Mrs. Mifflin who is a charming Quaker Girl, often enquires kindly after your Health.  Adieu my dear Wife--God bless you and yours. So wishes and prays, without ceasing, John Adams ""

134,dg001139,1774,John Adams to William Tudor,"""John Adams to William Tudor   Dr Sir Phyladelphia Octr. 7.1774 I have just Time to thank you for your Letters by Mr Revere, and all other of your Favours. The Task which lies upon me here is very arduous. You can form no Conception of it: and I can give you no Idea of it. The Assurances you give me, of the great Dependence of the People, upon the Result of the Deliberations of the Congress, increase my Anxiety. I fear the operations of the Continent will be too Slow, to afford immediate Relief to Boston. What Shall be done for that Town is the most difficult Question We have before Us. The Professions and real Dispositions of the Gentlemen Seem to be the very best. But at this Distance from you We who came from you can Scarcely form an Adequate Idea of your State--much less can Strangers, to whom Words and Descriptions can convey but very Imperfect Notions. I have taken great Pains to inform the Gentlemen, and to know their Sentiments. The Proposal of Some among you of reassuming the old Charter, is not approved here, at all. The Proposal of Setting up a new Form of Government of our own, is less approved Still. The general opinion Seems to be, as far as I can collect it, that the Courts of Justice Should go on, upon the old Plan, according to the Charter and Laws of the Province. The Govnr cannot remove any of the Judges or Justices, according to the Charter without the Advice of his Council of fifteen, which they will never give, if for no other Reason; because they will never be asked. To this there are two objections, the first that the Inferiour Judges And the Justices, may refuse to Act. Whether they will or not, We at this Distance cannot determine. This if practicable would be the most agreable to the OCTOBER 7, 1774  Gentlemen here. The other objection is that this will not relieve Boston. This is certain, and there is no Gentleman here who can devise a Method for the Relief of that devoted Town. My Feelings for its dis tresses are exquisite. I lie down with it, in my Mind, I dream of it all night, and awake with its ghastly Spectre before my Eyes. I wish that you and all the rest of our Friends had been more explicit, in your private, confidential Letters to Us, in pointing out what was thought of and what was desired by the People of Boston and the Massachusetts. The Expressions in all your Letters are a little enigmatical--We are left to guess at the Meaning. If it is a secret Hope of any, as I suspect it is, that the Congress will advise to offensive Measures, they will be mistaken. I have had oppertunities enough both public and private, to learn with Certainty, the decisive Sentiments of the Delegates and others, upon this Point. They will not at this session vote to raise Men or Money, or Arms or Ammunition. Their Opinions are fixed against Hostilities and Ruptures, except they should become absolutely necessary, and this Necessity they do not yet See. They dread the Thoughts of an Action because, it would make a Wound which could never be healed. It would fix and establish a Rancour, which would descend to the latest Generations. It would render all Hopes of a Reconciliation with Great Britain desperate. It would light Up the Flames of War, perhaps through the whole Continent, which might rage for twenty year, and End, in the Subduction of America, as likely as in her Liberation. In a Letter, which has been received here, in Several, indeed, the Thought is thrown out, of removing the Inhabitants out of Boston. This would be the grandest Movement, imaginable, if it is practicable. But how all their Effects can be removed--how 20,000 People can go out--where they can find Support, I know not. It has always been my opinion, that it was best for every Man Woman and Child, who had an Inclination to go, and could find a Place, to leave the Town. I removed out myself upon this Principle--altho a different Sentiment prevailed generally at that Time. The Congress will this Day consider, the Case of Boston, and I will write you more particularly in the Evening.(1) Octr. 9th. Mr Revere will give you all the News. I have this Day been to a Romish Chappell. My Imagination is so full of holy Water, Crossings, Bowings, Kneelings and Genuflections, Images, Paintings, Crucifixes, Velvet, Gold, but above all, the Musick. I am amazed that Luther and Calvin, were ever able to break the Charm and dissolve the .Spell. Adieu John Adams ""

Your Situation sir is very important, it is extremely critical. A Rupture between the Troops under your Command and the Inhabitants of the Province over which you preside, would produce Consequences of the most Serious Nature.--.A Wound which could never be healed! It would establish Animosities which no Time could eradicate. The Province of the Massachusetts Bay are by your own Ac knowledgment, generally engaged in a Refusal to comply with the Act of Parliament for altering their Government. We can assure you sir, that this Refusal is agreable to the sentiments of this whole Continent, and that the People ought and will be Supported in it, by the united Voice and Efforts of America. We therefore intreat you sir, to desist from the further Fortifications of the Town, that the Jealousies and Apprehensions of the People, may be quieted and that they may not be driven to so desperate a step as that of quitting the Town and throwing themselves on the Charity of their Friends & Neighbours.

136,dg001141,1774,Samuel Adams Draft Letter to Thomas Gage,"""Samuel Adams' Draft Letter to Thomas Gage   Sir [October 7-8, 1774] The Delegates from his Majestys several Colonies of New Hampshire [ ] (1) assembled in general Congress in the City of Philadelphia take the Liberty of addressing you upon Subjects of the last OCTOBER 7, 1774  Importance, to your own Character, Happiness and Peace of Mind to his Majestys Service to the Wellfare of that Province over which you preside and of all North America, and, perhaps, of the whole British Empire. The Act of the British Parliament for shutting up the Harbour of Boston is universally deemd to be unjust and cruel; and the World now sees with Astonishment & Indignation the Distress which the In habitants of that loyal though devoted Town are suffering under the most rigid Execution of it. There are two other Acts passed in the present Session of Parliament, the one for regulating the Government of the Province of Massachusetts Bay and the other entitled an Act for the more impartial Administration of Justice in the same Province; the former of these Acts was made with the professed Purpose of materially altering the Charter of that Province granted by his Majesties Royal Predecessors King William & Queen Mary for themselves their Heirs &c forever; and both or either of them if put into Execution will shake the Foundations of that free & happy Constitution which is the Birthright of the English Subjects, and totally destroy the inestimable Blessing of Security in Life Liberty and Property. By your own Acknowledgment, the refusal of the People to yield obedience to these Acts is far from being confind to a Faction in the Town of Boston: It is general through the province. And we do now assure your Excellency, that this Refusal is vindicable, in the opinion of this Congress, by the Laws of Reason and Self preservation; and the People ought to be and will be supported in it by the united Voice and Efforts of all America. We are fully convinced that the Town of Boston and Province of the Massachusetts Bay are suffering in the righteous Cause of America, while they are nobly exerting themselves in the most spirited opposition to those oppressive Acts of Parliament and Measures of Administration which are calculated to annihilate our most sacred & invalueable Rights. It is with the deepest Concern that we observe, that while this Congress are deliberating on the most effectual Measures for the Restoration of American Liberty and a happy Harmony between the Colonies and the parent State, so essentially necessary to both, your Excellency is erecting Fortifications round the Town of Boston, whereby well grounded Jealousies are excited in the Minds of his Majesties faithful Subjects and apprehensions that all Communication between that Town & the Country will be cut off, or that this Freedom will be enjoyed at the Will of an Army. Moreover we would express to your Excellency the just Resentment which we feel at the Indignities offered to our worthy fellow Citizens in Boston and the frequent Violations of private property by   the Soldiers under your Command. These Enormities committed by a Standing Army, in our opinion, unlawfully posted there in a time of Peace, are irritating in the greatest Degree, and if not remedied will endanger the involving all America in the Horrors of a civil War! Your Situation Sir is extremely critical. A rupture between the Inhabitants of the Province over which you preside and the Troops under your Command would produce Consequences of the most serious Nature: A Wound which would never be heald! It would probably establish Animosities between Great Britain & the Colonies which time would never eradicate! In order therefore to quiet the Minds & remove the Jealousies of the people, that they may not be driven to such a State of Desparation as to quit the Town & fly for Shelter to their Friends & Countrymen, we intreat you from the Assurance we have of the peaceable Disposition of the Inhabitants to desist from further fortifications of the Town, and to give orders that a free & safe Communication between them & the Country may be restored & continued.

This Dr. Allison is a Man of Abilities and Worth, but I hear no Preachers here like ours in Boston, excepting Mr. Duchè. Coombs indeed is a good Speaker, but not an original, but a Copy of Duchè. The Multiplicity of Business and Ceremonies, and Company that we are perpetually engaged in, prevents my Writing to my Friends in Mass. as I ought, and prevents my recording many Material Things in my Journal. Phyladelphia with all its Trade, and Wealth, and Regularity is not Boston. The Morals of our People are much better, their Manners are more polite, and agreable--they are purer English. Our Language is better, our Persons are handsomer, our Spirit is greater, our Laws are wiser, our Religion is superiour, our Education is better. We exceed them in every Thing, but in a Markett, and in charitable public foundations. Went in the Afternoon to the Romish Chappell (1) and heard a good discourse upon the Duty of Parents to their Children, founded in Justice and Charity.

The Business of the Congress is tedious, beyond Expression. This Assembly is like no other that ever existed. Every Man in it is a great Man--an orator, a Critick, a statesman, and therefore every Man upon every Question must shew his oratory,-his criticism and his Political Abilities. The Consequence of this is, that Business is drawn and spun out to an inmeasurable Length. I believe if it was moved and seconded that We should. come to a Resolution that Three and two make five We should be entertained with Logick and Rhetorick, Law, History, Politicks and Mathematicks, concerning the Subject for two whole days, and then We should pass the Resolution unanimously in the Affirmative. The perpetual Round of feasting too, which we are obliged to submit to, make the Pilgrimage more tedious to me. This Day I went to Dr. Allisons Meeting in the Forenoon and heard the Dr.--a good Discourse upon the Lords Supper. This is a Presbyterian Meeting. I confess I am not fond of the Presbyterian Meetings in this Town. I had rather go to Church. We have better Sermons, better Prayers, better Speakers, softer, sweeter Musick, and genteeler Company. And I must confess, that the Episcopal Church is quite as agreable to my Taste as the Presbyterian. They are both Slaves to the Domination of the Priesthood. I like the Congregational Way best--next to that the Independent. This afternoon, led by Curiosity and good Company I strolled away to Mother Church, or rather Grandmother Church, I mean the Romish Chappell. Heard a good, short, moral Essay upon the Duty of Parents to their Children, founded in Justice and Charity, to take care of their Interests temporal and spiritual. This Afternoons Entertainment was to me, most awfull and affecting. The poor Wretches, fingering their Beads, chanting Latin, not a Word of which they understood, their Pater Nosters and Ave Maria's. Their holy Water-their Crossing themselves perpetually--their Bowing to the Name of Jesus, wherever they hear it--their Bowings, and Kneelings, and Genuflections before the Altar. The Dress of the Priest was rich with OCTOBER 9, 1774  Lace--his Pulpit was Velvet and Gold. The Altar Piece was very rich--little Images and Crucifixes about--Wax Candles lighted up. But how shall I describe the Picture of our Saviour in a Frame of Marble over the Altar at full Length upon the Cross, in the Agonies, and the Blood dropping and streaming from his Wounds. The Musick consisting of an organ, and a Choir of singers, went all the Afternoon, excepting sermon Time, and the Assembly chanted--most sweetly and exquisitely. Here is every Thing which can lay hold of the Eye, Ear, and Imagination. Every Thing which can charm and bewitch the simple and ignorant. I wonder how Luther ever broke the spell. Adieu.

145,dg001151,1774,George Washington to Robert Mackenzie,"""George Washington to Robert Mackenzie   Dear Sir, Philadelphia 9th October 1774 Your letter on the 13th ulto.,(1) from Boston, gave me pleasure, as I learnt thereby that you were well, and might be expected at Mount Vernon in your way to or from James river, in the course of the winter. When I have said this, permit me with the freedom of a friend, (for you know I always esteemed you) to express my sorry at For tune's placing you in a service, that must fix curses to [the] latest posterity upon the diabolical contrivers; and, if success (which by the by is impossible) accompanies it, execrations upon all those who have been instrumental in the execution. I do not mean by this to insinuate that an officer is not to dis charge his duty, even when chance, not choice, has placed him in a disagreeable situation; but I conceive, when you condemn the conduct of the Massachusetts People, you reason from effects, not causes; otherwise you would not wonder at a people who are every day receiving fresh proofs of a Systematic exertion of an arbitrary power, deeply planned to overturn the Laws & Constitution of their Country, & to violate the most essential & valuable rights of mankind, being irritated, & with difficulty restrained from acts of the greatest violence and intemperance. For my own part, I confess to you candidly, that I view things in a very different point of light to the one in which you seem to consider them; and though you are led to believe, by venal men (for such I must take the liberty of calling those new fangled Counsellors which fly to & surround you, & all others, who, for honorary or pecuniary gratifications will lend their aid to overturn the Constitution, & introduce a system of arbitrary Government) altho' you are taught, I say, by discoursing with such men, to believe that the people of Massachusetts are rebeilious, setting up for independency & what not; give me leave, my good friend, to tell you, that you are abused--grossly abused; and this I advance with a degree of confidence, & boldness which may claim your belief; having better opportunities of knowing the real sentiments of the people you are among, from the Leaders of them, in opposition to the present measures of Administration, than you have from those whose business it is not to disclose truth, but to misrepresent facts in order to justify as much as possible to the world, their own conduct; for give me leave to add, & I think I can announce it as a fact, that it is not the wish or interest of that Government, or any other upon this Continent, separately, or collectively, to set up for Independency; but this you may at the same time rely on, that none of them will ever submit to the loss of those valuable rights & privileges which are es- OCTOBER 10, 1774  sential to the happiness of every free State, and without which, Life, Liberty & property are rendered totally insecure. These Sir, being certain consequences which must naturally result from the late acts of Parliament relative to America in general, & the Government of Massachusetts Bay in particular, is it to be wonder'd at, I repeat, that Men who wish to avert the impending blow, should attempt to oppose it in its progress, or prepare for their defence, if it cannot be diverted? Surely I may be allowed to answer in the negative; & give me leave to add, as my opinion, that more blood will be spilt on this occasion (if the Ministry are determined to push matters to extremity) than history has ever yet furnished instances of in the annals of North America; and such a vital wound given to the peace of this great Country, as time itself cannot cure or eradicate the remembrance of. But I have done. I was involuntarily led into a short discussion of this subject by your remarks on the conduct of the Boston People; & your opinion of their wishes to set up for independency. I am as well satisfied, as I can be of my existence, that no such thing is desired by any thinking man in all North America; on the contrary, that it is the ardent wish of the warmest advocates for liberty, that peace & tranquility, Upon constitutional grounds, may be restored, & the hor- rors of civil discord prevented. I am very glad to hear that my friend Stewart was well when you left London; I have not had a letter from him these five years, nor heard of him, I think, for two. I wish you had mentioned his em- ployment. Poor Mercer! I often hear from him; much cause has he, I fear, to lament his having fallen into the accursed state of attendance & dependance.

Peyton Randolph Esqr. was unanimously chosen President, and Charles Thompson Esqr. Secretary, a List of the Members We inclose. The mode of Voting in this Congress was First resolved upon, which was that each Colony should have one Voice, but as this was objected To as unequall, an Entry was made on the Journals To prevent its being drawn into precedent in future. Committees were then appointed to state American Rights, and greivances; And of the various Acts of the British Parliament which affect the Trade and Manufactures of these Colonies, on these Subjects The Committees Spent several Days, when The Congress judg'd it necessary, previous to compleating & resolving on these Subjects, to take under Consideration, That of Ways and Means for redress. On the 16th arrived an Express from Boston with Letters to The Delegates and the Suffolk Resolves. These were laid before the Congress and were highly approved of & applauded, as You will see, by the inclosed Paper of the 19th, in which the proceedings of the Congress, thereon, is published at large, by their Order.(2) A general Nonimportation of British Goods & Manufactures or of any Goods from thence, appearing to the Congress one of the means of redress in our power, and which OCTOBER 10, 1774  might probably be adopted, to prevent future difficulties and alterca- tions on this Subject among those who might Now, or for sometime past, had been sending Orders for Goods, The Congress Unanimously came into the inclosed Resolution on the 22d and the same was ordered to be published immediately.(3) Since this a Nonimportation and Non Consumption of Goods, &c from Great Brittain & Ireland from & after the first of December next, has been Unanimously re solved on,(4) but to carry so important a resolution into effect, it is necessary, that every possible precaution should Now be taken, on the one hand to prevent wicked, & desperate Men, from breaking through, & defeating it, either by Fraud, or Force, and on the other to remove as farr as possible every Temptation to, or Necessity for the Violation thereof. For this a Committee, are appointed, who not having as yet compleated their Report, nothing is published particularly on this Subject, more than what, We now are at Liberty, in general to relate. We have the pleasure of finding the whole Congress, & through them the whole Continent of the same Sentiment, & opinion, of the late proceedings & Acts of the British Parliament, but at the same time confess Our anxiety for greater dispatch of the Business before Us, than it is in Our power, or perhaps in the Nature of the Subject, to effect. An Assembly like this, though it consists, of less than Sixty Members, yet coming from remote Colonies, each of which, has some modes, of transacting public Business, peculiar to itself some particular provincial rights and Interests to guard, & secure, must take some Time, to become so acquainted with each ones situations & connections, as to be able to give an united assent, to the ways & means proposed for effecting, what all are ardently desirous of. In this View Our president, Though a Gentleman of great Worth, & one who fills & supports the Dignity of his Station to Universal acceptance, yet cannot urge Forward matters to an issue with that dispatch, which he might in a different Assembly. Nor considering the great importance of something more than a Majority, an Unanimity would it be safe and prudent--Unanimity being in Our View of the last importance, every one must be heard, even on those points, or Subjects which are in themselves not of the last importance And indeed it often happens that what is of little or No Consequence to one Colony, is of the last To another. We have thus hinted to Your Honor Our general Situation, which hope will Acct. For Our being delayed here beyond the Time which either the Colony or We ourselves expected. Though Our private Concerns, & Connections, as well as the public expectation, & Interest of the Colony urge Us, to make all possible dispatch, Yet as we find it would not only be of dangerous Consequence, but perhaps impracticable, to attempt pushing Matters, to a decision Faster, than they now come to it in the Course they are,  We Find it most prudent patiently to wait the issue. We shall be able to write You more particularly. in a few Days but could not omit this Opportunity of writing Thus farr, on the subject of Our delegation here. We take Liberty to inclose the Copy of Lord Dunmore's proclamation on which shall only say it appears in some parts of it very extraordinary, and would occasion much greater Speculations here than it does were it not that few or None save the Proprietors consider themselves interested in the Controversy, & the whole Attention of the public is taken up on more important Subjects.(5) Laurel Hill is about Forty Miles on this Side Fort Duquesne alias Fort Pitt and is a range of Mountains running Northerly nearly in a Line with the West Boundary of the province of Maryland, and Cuts off from that province, one whole County, lately erected by the Name of Westmoreland. His Lordship is now in those parts near the Ohio with an Army of Fifteen Hundred Virginians, reducing the Indian Tribes to Subjection or driving them off the Land. We cannot be positive as To The Time of Our Return, but hope to be at New Haven before the rising of the Assembly, and may probably be able to write with greater certainty in Our Next.

153,dg001160,1774,People of Great Britain and Ireland,"""People of Great Britain and Ireland   [October 11-18? 1774] (1) To the People of Great Britain and Ireland We The Delegates from the english Colonies of New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, lower Counties on Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina & South Carolina assembled in general Con OCTOBER 11, 1774  gress at Philadelphia, find with inexpressible concern that his Majesties faithful and loyal Subjects of North America are driven by the hard necessity of their Situation to adopt Measures from which injury may be derived to many of their fellow subjects in Great Britain and Ireland. When the experience of a Century and an half evinces that from the first settlement of these Colonies, their Inhabitants have been most remarkable for steady loyalty, and for an uniform zealous attachment to the interests and commercial Success of the mother Country a candid mind will find no difficulty in believing what is certainly true, that their conduct now results solely from the overuling principles of self preservation, which demands the Protection of their Liberty, the Security of their lives and property; against a lately adopted System of plantation government, repugnant to the english constitution, the faith of Charters, and constant Usage from the first settlement of englishmen in North America: Against which System the Assemblies of the different Colonies have by humble and dutiful petitions frequently but in vain supplicated for relief. The possession of Liberty and the security of property being of such great and evident importance, so essentially necessary for human happiness, so earnestly contended for and so long enjoyed by Britain from whence we sprung; it is not to be wondered that our Ancestors before they would hazard their lives and venture their private fortunes to explore and settle this distant country, obtained royal charters, securing and confirming to them and their Posterity forever, all the Franchises privileges and immunities of the free people of England they left behind them. It is most certain that nothing but an undeviating attention to their charter rights and a firm reliance on the honor and Justice of the mother country could have sustained them unaided, unassisted as they were, in their slow and perilous advances to settlement through the savage Wilderness. But the industry of human nature being invincible when led by Liberty and a conscious Security of Property, the first Settlers having with fortitude and perseverance surmounted the greatest Difficulties, their Posterity, with the aid of emigrants, at length furnish the mother country an inexhaustible fund of materials for commerce with an almost unlimited demand for british manufactures, and consequently produced employment for several hundred sail of Ships and many thousand Seamen. It is well known how greatly the american Trade has in creased the value of lands in Britain, and what multitudes of People are entirely supported by the american Consumption of british Mer chandize. Such immense advantages being derived from the enter prizing and successful adventure of our Ancestors, how well we their descendants are entitled to a peaceable Possession of those just rights originally stipulated for by them and to them granted by former Princes, we leave to the determination of all reasonable men.  Soon after the close of the last war, all british America was stricken with amazement and concern, to find the Ministry had adopted a plan for taking the Property of the Colonists from them without the consent of their Representatives, under the Pretence of raising a revenue in America for the purposes of defending and protecting the Colonies, and for supporting the Government and Administration of Justice here, with the further plausible reason of reembursing Great Britain a part of the Expence encurred by defending the Colonies in the last war. To inforce this unconstitutional and unjust System of Taxation, every fence that the wisdom of our british Ancestors had carefully erected against Arbitrary power, has been violently thrown down in America;(2) and a variety of Acts of Parliament have been passed depriving the american Subjects of the invaluable Trial by Jury in Cases of Property, by enabling the Prosecutor to carry the defendent into far distant Courts of Admiralty. And as well by a late Statute in the [ ] (3) year of his present Majesty's reign as by an extension of an obsolete and tyrannic Act of King Henry the eighth, the same equitable method of Trial in cases that touch life is likewise taken away from the Colonists, who are to be carried in chains 3000 miles from their native country without evidence or Assistance of friends to be tried by a Jury of strangers. A standing Army with all its oppressive concomitants has been fixed without our consent. The colony of Massachusetts Bay has had its antient charter subverted, thirty thousand People in the Town of Boston invested by military violence, and the horid Crime of murder there encouraged by an Act authorising the removal of Offenders from the Justice of the Province and carryed to Great Britain, where distance and expence will surely prevent there being followed. Nor has the fury of ad ministration stopped here, but determined to destroy both the religion & Liberty of british America they have procured an act of the last Session for extending the Province of Canada in such manner as to border on the western frontiers of all the Northern Colonies and there established a dispotic Government and the roman catholic Religion, well knowing from the truth of history that this bloody and intollerant religion is at such fatal variance with Protestanism, that the inhabitants of that now greatly extended Country will thereby be well fitted both from civil & religious Principles to carry Slaughter and destruction into the free protestant Colonies whenever they shall be encouraged by a wicked Ministry to do so.(4) It has been already observed that the ostensible reasons which have been assigned for this Attempt to destroy natural, constitutional, chartered, and antient rights, is for the purpose of raising a revenue to protect and defend the Colonies, to support Government and the Administration of Justice here and to reimburse Great Britain  the Expence of defending the Colonies in the last war. The two former reasons are sufficiently answered by stating the notorious facts, that from the first Settlement of the Colonies until the late War they sustained these Expences themselves and during the Continuance of that war having at their own charge supported [ ] (5) men, in doing which our late & present Sovereigns were so well satisfied, that we had consulted our Zeal for the common cause more than our Ability, that declarations from the throne to this effect abound on the Journals of Parliament, recommending the Justice of reembursing us, and although Parliament did vote considerable sums for this purpose, yet it is a truth well known that these were chiefly applied to the further support of the war and in consequence did not operate to remove the Burthens created by these zealous and unrestrained Efforts against the common enemy. The royal recommendation to Parliament to reimburse The Colonies is founded upon this clear principle of substantial justice, that wealth, the sinews of war, is withheld from the Colonists by the British acts of Navigation which place them under a monopolized Trade, confining their purchase of european Commodities to the british markets and directs the Disposal of american Products through the same Channel, which in fact obliges the Colonists who consume british Merchandize to the amount of three millions annually, to pay the Taxes of all Manufacturers, Merchants and Seamen concerned in making, selling and transporting the same. In the Acts of Navigation therefore, and not by unconstitutional Taxation, a just and rational Man will search for & find the American assistance of the common cause. Conclusive as this reasoning is yet the Colonists have given ample testimony in the two last wars of their Zeal and readiness to strain every Nerve in aid of the mother country, whenever called upon to do so in a constitutional manner by royal requisitions to their respective Colony Assemblies. When we contend against being taxed by the british parliament where we are not, and in which from our Distance we cannot be represented, we find ourselves warranted by rea son, the english Constitution, by express compacts with our Princes, and by usage as old as the Settlement of these Colonies. We should certainly be Slaves if we were not exempted from such Taxation. Property must become too precarious for the Genius of a free people, which can be taken from them at the will of others who cannot know what Taxes such people can bear, or the easiest mode of raising them; and who are not under those restraints which are the greatest Security against abuse, the Danger of removal at a new election and being themselves affected by every tax imposed on the people. It cannot be necessary for us to prove to a british understanding that liberty is essential to human happiness, and that the safety of property is the security of liberty; every page of english his  tory proves their generous, brave attachment to these principles, and we should be unworthy of the british Ancestry which is now our boast, if we did not esteem our constitutional liberty far above the possession of Life, disgraced with the Shackles of Slavery. It grieves us to find that some malignant Spirits in Great Britain charge us with designing independency and wanting to dissolve all connection with the parent State. To such incendiaries, foes to the happiness of both countries, we reply that our whole history from the beginning, our uniform tenor of conduct is directly in the teeth of their assertion. And altho' we cannot help being misrepresented by the Agents of dispotism & avarice, we absolutely and solemnly disavow all thoughts of Disunion from Great Britain and we do profess and declare our steady loyalty to our sovereign Lord king George the third, and our ardent wish to promote the glory happiness and commercial interest of the Mother Country, which would be in emminent danger indeed, if three millions of people already in these Colonies by submitting to Slavery should render themselves fit Instruments to enslave the rest of their fellow subjects; a plan it would seem, in great favor with administration, who design the ruin of American Liberty by establishing Popery and Despotism in Canada, that thereby the people and property of all North America being at Ministerial devotion, may with great effect be applied to subdue that stubborn English Virtue, which heretofore contending for its darling Liberty, has proved the ruin of many wicked Ministers and evil Counsellors, too many of whom have of late years unhappily sur rounded the Throne and vitiated the British councils, to the infinite distress and confusion of the whole Empire. Whenever Parliament is pleased to restore us to the state we were in at the conclusion of the last war, by repealing the Acts claiming a right to and establishing the means of raising a revenue in America: and those most oppressive Statutes against the Colony of Massachusetts Bay, because they have bravely contended for their own and American freedom; when the law shall be declared against endangering the life of every American by making him liable to transportation to England for Trial; when the dangerous Quebec Act is no more; these oppressive grievances being removed, we shall think no longer of restraining our Exports and Imports, but intent on promoting the common interest and happiness of the united Empire will be industrious to improve the vast uncultivated territory of North America, and being chiefly engaged in Agriculture, the commodities for exportation, and the consumption of British Manufactures will be continually increasing. But this most desirable connection between Great Britain and the Colonies supported by such a happy intercourse of reciprocal benefits must be interrupted, if the people of America are distressed and ruined by unconstitutional Taxes. Their Liberty and antient rights  being taken away, no encouragement to industry will remain, but ig- norance and idleness the constant Attendants on Slavery will overrun this great Continent, hitherto the seat of freedom, virtue, and growing Science.

160,dg001167,1774,Samuel Ward s Notes for a Speech in Congress,"""Samuel Ward's Notes for a Speech in Congress   Mr. President [October 12, 1774] (1) The Question before you is certainly of the utmost Importance, in the Solution of it are involved the Happiness or Misery not only of the present Generation of Americans but of Millions yet unborn. I must therefore beg your Permission to enter largely into the Subject.(2) The Parliamt. ought not to be allowed the Regulation of our Trade for many Reasons. 1st. Because We having no Voice in their Election they are not our Representa[tive]s & consequently have no Rights to make Laws for Us in any Case whatsoever. To put this Matter in a clear Point of View it is necessary to recur to the Origin of Parliaments. It is now universally allowed that all good Government is founded in Compact. Mankind prompted to Society by Nature (to associate) & finding they could not procure or enjoy the necessaries and Conveniences of Life or defend themselves from Force & Injury in an unconnected separate State (assembled &f) formed themselves into various (Countries) some in one Country, others in another in the Infancy of Society. They directed & managed their own affairs in Person as they thought most for the common Good. In Time (the larger & larger) Societies became very extensive & the Members so numerous that they became impracticable to supply the Want of this personal Direction of many public affairs. The Wisdom of our saxon Ancestors devised the best Substitute in the Power of Man to point out which was that the People should appoint & authorize certain Per sons in whose Wisdom & Virtue They could confide (in) to represent the whole Body of the Nation & in their Behalf to enact in Con junction with their Chief or King such Laws Rules & Ordinances as would be for the general Good of the Community. This it will be allowed was the Origin of the english Parliament. The End of their Appointment was to (Take Care of) Preservation & Promoting of the Interests & Happiness of whom--of their Constituents undoubtedly & not of the People of France Spain or Holland.(3) [. . .] of all the Benefits of an extensive & valuable Inheritance [conveyed?] to them from their worthy ancestors who purchased it with their Blood & Tresure & of the Fruits of their own Labours and reduce them to such a miserable State of Vassalage as to be compelled to consume their Lives in the vilest Drudgery & Servitude in Order to acquire Property for their Oppressors who like true Tyrants would allow them no greater Share of the Produce of their own Labours than will be barely sufficient to preserve their miserable Beings in such a State as may qualify them for further Servitude. OCTOBER 12, 1774  3rd [In] any other Country The People who appointed & gave their Delegates the Power which they became possessed of had no Power of making Laws for those Countries themselves [and] therefore could not give any Such to their Representatives or any other Persons. Had the People of (France) Spain or Holland or any other Country chosen & impower'd the Persons who compose the brith. Parlt to make Laws & Ordinances for them there is no Doubt but upon every Principle of Law & Equity they ought to be asked [to] obey all Laws made by such their Representatives because the Act & Deed of the Substitute or Representative so far as he pursues the [. . .] but as the People of Spain or Holland have not delegated such Power to the british Parliament, They, should that Parliament attempt to impose Laws upon them, would undoubtedly treat them with the Contempt & Indignity which such usurpation would merit. Upon the same Principles America having never given any such Power to the british Parliament to make Laws for them cannot be under any Obligation in Law Equity or Conscience to submit to Acts of Parliament. Upon this simple Principle of Representation & consequent Legislation Stands the british Constitution & upon this Foundation is the Throne established in the royal House of Hanover. The Minister therefore who tramples upon the Peoples Right of Representation undermines the Constitution & tears up by the Roots the Pillars on which his majesty's Throne is fixed. But it is said that some of these Acts of Trade were made before the granting of some of the American Charters & consequently those who recd. those Charters were parties to the Acts & are concluded by them.(4) If this proves any Thing it proves too much, that is that they were Parties to & are concluded by all Acts of Parliament made before their Emigration. This would introduce into America the canon Law the payment of tiths [to] the Clergy & innumerable other Laws Statutes & Regulations (& Burdens) which would soon deprive us of all Liberty & Property & with this manifest Injustice & Partiality that every (Man) Freeholder in Britain tho' Party to making a Law & therefore held to obey it while in Force has a Right if he dislikes the Law to instruct his Representative to get it repealed & if he does not do it to remove him & chuse a new Representative, but the American who came from England after making such Laws has no Right to instruct his quondam Representative or to remove him should he refuse to obey his Instructions & appoint another. Consequently as his Power of Appointment his Right of Instructing or removing his constitutional Controul of such Representative cease with his Emigration to America, the Duty of Submission or Obedience consequential upon the Enjoyment of these several Rights must cease with them.  But it will be said that having imigrated under Charters from the Crown We brought our Allegeance with Us. The King granted those Charters, to him therefore We owe Allegiance according to the Tenor of those Charters, to him We ever have been & always desire to be faithful Subjects but is there a Word of the Power of Parliament in those Charters? Not one. But it is said We are not to make Laws contrary to the Laws of England it is true but are to make them as near as may be agreable to the Laws of the Realm considering the Nature & Constitution of the Place & People there. That is in other Words The King gives no Power to depart wholly from the (english Constitution) Principles of the Laws of England but being sensible that (that Constitution in its) those Laws would not suit the People & Country of America impowers them to make Laws differing from the Laws of England as far as the Nature & Constitution of the Place & People in America required. And that this is the Sense of the King upon this Head is plain. Witness the Massachusetts Act for Division of intestate Estates which 'tho directly repugnant to the common Law of England hath recd. the royal Assent. But it is said that the Parliament has a Right to regulate Trade by our Acquiescence in their Acts for that Purpose.(5) A man may be compelled by Force to submit to many Injuries for instance Impris- onment of his Person, Deprivation of his Property or the Use of that Property & finding the Time of his Deliverance not come may appear as easy as he can under Oppression but does this give the Invader a Right to continue [....] By no Means. The great Grotius justly says Quod ab initio injustum est nullo potest fieri modo aut usu justum aut rectum. That is whatever is originally wrong in its own Nature cannot be sanctifyed or made right by Repetition & Use.(6) The Moment then the Man has it in his Power he may assert his Freedom & recover Possession of his Estate: Besides several of the Colonies protested against these Acts in their Infancy & the Crown in some Instances so far from claiming parliamentary Jurisdiction requested the Colonies to pass such Acts as were nec[essar]y. It is said by other Gentlemen that the Parliament has a Right to the Power of regulating our Trade because they have afforded Us Protection.(7) It has been an inviolable Rule with Me never to forget a Kindness and as far as We have recd. Favors let US by all Means make proper Compensation but let US first state the Acct. Those who first attempted to settle the Colony of Virginia were left by the Parliamt. to their own Fate and perished. Their Successors defended themselves for above a Century. Those who began the Settlement of New England were unsupported & lost half their Number the first Winter they were in America and the Survivors carried on the Settlement at their own Expence defended themselves by their own united Force & Bravery from this  Period. The Parliament afforded little or no Protection save the Reputation of the british Navy for many years. The (Restoration of) Purchase of Peace to Britain by the Conquest of Cape Breton, added to the commercial Advantages derived from the Colonies, is surely adequate satisfaction for Protection to this Time. During the Peace the Emoluments arising to G. Britain from the American Trade must much overbalance the Expence She was at for their Protec[tio]n. In the last War She was at a very considerable Expence in America [but] the Colonies were at a much greater one in Proportion to their Circumstances. A most extensive Country hath been conquered. Upon opening such extensive Views of Settlement the Value of Lands (and the Value) that of all real Estate in the old Colonies sunk one half and all the Advantages of the new Territory G. Britain confined to herself. Again it has been said by one of the greatest Men in the Nation that the Advantages derived to G. Britain from the Trade of the Col- onies was 2 millions a year & that this Fund carried her through the last War. Surely Sir this immense Profit & the Property & commercial advantages of such a vast Territory as was conquered from France must be full Compensation for the Protection granted Us in the late War. if this Computation be right the Claim of Regulation upon this footing immediately vanishes. But it is said She ought to have this Power from the Necessity of the Case, it being absolutely necessary that there should be some supreme Power in every State which has a Right to collect the united Force of the community and direct it in such a Manner as may be for the general Good, & that this Power can be no where so well placed as in G. Britain. (8) That it is necessary that there should be some supreme Legislature in every Community to regulate & direct the public affa[irs] of that Community all Authors Agree, but that it is necessary where twenty separate Governments, which is the Case of the Kings Dominions, are existing that the whole Interest and Power of nineteen should be submitted to Controul (& under) the Direction of the twentieth no Author of Credit maintains. And it cannot upon any just Principles be proved to be more necessary for general Good that this should be done than that all the Different Governments in the World should be united under one single Government in order that the whole Force of the World should be [exerted]. The Capacities of human nature are so limited that They are not able to comprehend and adjust the various Interests of such remote & extensive Countries and wrong Information given by those who are near them & interested in their Decisions and want of proper Information from those who are remote together with self Partiality & Prejudice in the Rulers will undoubtedly induce a Sacrifice of the Interests & Happiness of many remote States to that of the one  which is the Seat of Power. That this hath been the unhappy Case of all Countries who were subject to foreign Government all History proves but We need go [no] further for Proof of this than to the miserable People of Ireland and the distressed State of the Province of the Massachusetts Bay. But is said that as We emigrated from Britain we ought to consider her as a Mother State. I have the highest Idea of parental & filial Connections but the Duties are reciprocal. While she discharges her Duty let Us gratefully do ours but let her not think that because certain Persons who came [.... ] (9) I have proved that the Parliament have no Right to regulate our Trade upon any just Principles whatsoever. I shall now endeavour to prove that the giving them such a Power would be the entire Ruin of America. The People of England formerly a sober frugal industrious & brave People are now immersed in Luxury Riot & Dissipation. The Parliament once a freely elected, a nearly equal Representation & an independent Branch of the Leg- islature above the Frowns, Flatteries & Bribes of a Minister now first purchase their own Seats of the miserable venal Electors & then sell them & the rest of the People (for Slaves) to the Minister. The nation for Ages wholly free from Debt as a Nation is now involved in a Debt of £128 Millions. Bribery Corruption and Pensions swallow the greatest Part of those vast Taxes & Duties paid by the People. Is such a Parliament to be intrusted with the Interests of America? Would you (commit your property to) put your all into such Hands? England Ireland & that vast Country in the east Indies subject to the india Compy. are sinking under the Load of Oppression. will you [be] like Issachar represented by a strong Ass crouching down under two Burdens too [heavy for] your Shoulders to bear & become subject to Tribute? God forbid. Always consider yourselves as a Part of the Kings Dominions. Generously do all you can for your fellow Subjects & be assured that you cannot more effectually serve your King, your Brethren in G Britain & your Country than by preserving your Liberty.(10) ""

From 10 O Clock untill half after four, We were debating, about the Parliamentary Power of regulating Trade. 5 Colonies were for allowing it, 5. against it, and two divided among themselves, i.e. Mass. and Rhode Island. Mr. Duane has had his Heart sett upon asserting in our Bill of Rights, the Authority of Parliament to regulate the Trade of the Col- onies. He is for grounding it on Compact, Acquiescence, Necessity, Protection, not merely on our Consent. ""

162,dg001169,1774,James Duane s Notes for a Speech in Congress,"""James Duane's Notes for a Speech in Congress   [October 13? 1774] (1) I. America at eve of a civil War--much depends on wisdom of Congress. Our fate suspended on a thread. If Boston subdued all's lost. II. But two subjects of dispute between G. B. and the Colonies. a. A Revenue for the support of our own civil establishments. b. the regulation of Trade. (I) As to Revenue the whole amount never more than to about 35,000 and the sums by G. B. to above £ 400,000. (2) This article provided for by our Resolution to provide a competent and honorable salary for the administration of govt and justice. b. The right of regulating trade the great point. 1. Its importance to G. B. who must support her title to it at the expense of the last drop of her blood and last farthing of her treasure. 2. good policy of allowing it to her clearly. (I) will be the best messenger of peace. OCTOBER 13, 1774  (2) It will remove all suspicion that we seek after independence. 3. It is necessary that it should be expressly recognized. a. Because in the great dispute between Hutchinson and the Massachusetts, it is left doubtful. b. Because every different house of Assembly must instruct its Agent on this essential point. c. Because a difference of sentiment will shew our weakness and may end in our disunion. d. But above all because our Bill of Rights makes this explanation indispensible. Vide--Art--bound by no Law without participation in Legislature--and exclusive Right of legislation..(2) e. These totally defeat all Regulations of Trade. Inst: Custom House and exactions there, seizures on shore, writs of assistance &c. Objections. 1st. It is said we are not authorised to give up any right and this is setting up a Right for G. B. Answer. 1. Besides the justice and policy of such a recognition; it is un- avoidable when we are considering a right in connection with the parent State. 2. It is giving G. B. no new right: but only acknowledging what she has enjoyed ever since our Colonization. 3. It is agreed on all hands that there must be some supreme controlling power over our trade, and that this can only rest with Parliament Objection II. It is said to be too dangerous, because on pretence of a Right to regulate Trade, Parliament may raise a Revenue upon us, and otherwise oppress us. Answer. 1. If we argue against the use of power because it may be abused, the argument proves too much. It strikes at all society and all government--but to a state of society confidence is essential. 2. Instance the prerogative of the Crown to call an Assemby. l t never may be called--yet we do not deny the prerogative. II. But here can be no room for apprehension. They exercise the right and none mean to dispute it. Our interest will be served by admitting it under restrictions (to wit) that it be conducted bona fide, with a just regard to the interest of the respective members of the Empire excluding every idea of taxation internal and external for the purpose of raising a revenue without our consent. [ ] (3) our admission cannot injure us. 2. Supposing the power should be abused. Can we not remon-  strate and oppose--shall we be less able hereafter to do our selves justice than at this day? Objectn. III. That this Proposition is improper in our Bill of Rights; because instead of a privilege it is a burthen. Answer. 1. It is certainly improper in the order it stands; it ought to follow our claim to exclusive legislation by way of edification and it will then be considered. Object. IV. It may be said that because we admit the authority of Parliament in this instance, it may be [asserted?], as a proof of their power in all cases. Answer. There is a most manifest distinction. 1. In cases of internal policy and taxation our legislatures are competent--have enjoyed such jurisdictions. They are secured by Charter--not so with respect to trade. 2. The Parliamentary authority over our trade was co-eval with our settlement, and is considered as a compact. 3. This exhibits a line and fixed rule so much desired for ascer- taining that power. ""

We are unable to defend our Rights & therefore we must allow them the right. We must not argue from an abuse agt a Use. The Parl. have as good a right to regulate as if the Acts were made before we emigrated. It was before some of us did, & the same Rule will hold to Hen 8. ch. 37. Our Charters say we must make no Laws contrary to Laws of England, but will not the denial of this right be contrary. OCTOBER 13, 1774  What shall I tell our House of Assembly? They must instruct their Agent. The People of N England must not think of any assistance from other Colonys in fighting. Nothing but giving up this will stop the Effusion of Blood. Chase. Can you regulate the Trade with[ou]t meddling to internal Polity? I am agt. Stirring it, but now it is Stirrd I am for allowing it expressly. Hooper. Colonys are bound by Laws wch dont injure them. The Duty on wine is bad. Johnson. I Acknowledge the Right & you may make the terms. Q [uere] in w [ha] t instance have they been deprived of the Practice? [Speaker unidentified].

It is dangerous from the religion & arbitrary constitution which it establishes. 2d. From it's excessive magnitude. 3d. From the supposed and probable motives which gave birth to it. 4th. Good policy to complain of it, as meeting the popular clamor in England. 5th. Hence readily agreed to mention it in the petition to the King which will answer good purposes. But to make it one of the articles which is to operate on our commerce; cannot be consented to by New York for those reasons. 1. We ought in this measure to carry our thoughts to the event-and to consider the justice and policy of every article as if it was that singly on which we stood--for in the event all but that may be rejected.(3) 2. We have three things in this Bill to complain of. 1. The establishment of the Roman [Catholic Religion?]. 2d. The institution of an arbitrary government. 3d. The extension of the Colony by excessive limits. How far it will be justifiable in us to resist the progress of this Act and attempt to force its Repeal at the expense of our commerce--in the end perhaps of a civil war--ought to be duly considered. 1st. If we demand too much we weaken our efforts--lose the chance of securing what is reasonable and may get nothing. 2d. Will it not be said that we go beyond our sphere--and while we contend for an exclusive internal legislature intermeddle with the police of other governmts? 3d. Is it not a disputable point with respect to religion whether more is granted to the Canadians than was solemnly promised by the capitulation? 4th. If government is founded on consent is it not disputable whether the new form is not agreeable to the majority of inhabitants? 5th. Is it not disputable whether the conqueror has not a right to impose laws on the conquered? 6. Is it probable that in a matter of some uncertainty at least, our constituents will be discontented with this part of our Resolution? And unwilling to be under restraints on that account. Lee thinks it the worst grievance. OCTOBER 15, 1774  1. Massacre of Paris: Cruelty of Roman Catholics: No safety. 2. Religion confirmed there: to what end? 3. Lands held by military tenure. 4.

It is probable that This Week will go near to close The Affairs immediately before Us, as the General Heads are agreed on, and Committees appointed to make the Draughts. No Resolution of any Consequence, and I dare say, you will judge, some of them so, has been pass'd in the Congress, but with an Unanimous Voice, though they have many of them taken up Days in close, & at Times, warm debate. Three capital, & ,general Objects were in View From The First--A Bill of American Rights,--A List of American Greivances,--And Measures For Redress. You will easily consider the First the most important Subject that could possibly be taken up by Us, as on the Fixing them rightly, with precision, yet sufficiently explicit, & on a certain, and durable Basis, such as the Reason & Nature of things, the Natural Rights of Mankind, The Rights of British Subjects, in general, and the particular, & local privileges, Rights, & immunities of British American Subjects, considered in degree dis tinct, yet connected with the Empire at large. On This I say, all the Consistency at least, of Our future proceedings, in America depends, and in a great degree, the peace, & Liberty, of the American Colonies In doing this, We have proceeded with the Utmost Caution knowing how critical and important an undertaking it was, & how fatal a misstep must be, not to Ourselves only but to all posterity. Consequently the whole British Constitution, its rise, progress, & completion, has been reveiwed minutely,--All the Statutes respecting it, or OCTOBER 16, 1774  affecting the Colonies attended To and considered--when You add to This, The Time necessarily spent as well as Difficulty to be en countered at last, To bring Men, From infancy, habituated to different modes, of Treating Subjects, perfectly to harmonize, You will set down no small portion of Our Time to this Head of Business. Our Greivances You will say are evident To all, and may be enumerated in one Day as well as in a Month,--on second Thought You will perhaps be willing to give Us longer Time on that part--For a Greivance deserving the Notice of the United Continent must not only be a real, but one so general, That a Stand must be made against it, and Our measures for redress, be persevered in, untill it is removed. To enumerate as greivances, matters of lesser Moment, would be below the dignity, & lessen the weight of this Continental Council, here again, We have recourse To the Statutes, the Usages, & Customs of both Countries to direct Us, as Well as to their, & Our Bill of Rights. The Measures to be pursued for, or mode of obtaining Redress is a delicate, yet important Subject. These Three Subjects have taken up the Cheif of Our Time. We meet at Nine, & set untill half past Three, then adjourn untill the Next Morning, this brings Us to Dinner at Four or afterwards, which being generally in parties, on invitation out, or at Our Lodgings concludes the Day, and though We have sat, now, Six Weeks, We have not had One day's respite. Two Expresses from Boston, have taken up part of Our Time, by one of them I wrote largely, the substance of which You have doubteless seen.(2) The Assembly of this province met Yesterday and chose Mr. Biddle Speaker, and appointed Mr. Dickinson an additional Member, to represent this Province in Congress, so that We may expect his Company Tomorrow in Carpenters Hall. This will find You at New Haven, Next Saturday. Mr. T. Sey- mour I hear is a Brother Member. Present my Compliments To him, and Tell him, that Watson of Hartford, merits the severest reproof, for printing in his paper the false, & scandalous paragraphs, from Rivington's Gazette, respecting the Congress. Rivington in private Life is more infamous than Chartres, & in public a greater incendiary than Clodius, yet this Stupid Watson, reprints in the Connecticut Courant the improbable Forgeries, of this most superlatively vile, retailer of Scandal.(3) I have repeatedly admonished Watson, but to no purpose, a press in his hands, is like firebrands, Arrows, & Death in the hands of a Fool or Madman, and all We have to console Ourselves with, is that his Weakness prevents his doing extensive mischief. Rivington is become so detestable every where to the Southward of New York, &c even in That City, to all, but a Ministerial Junto, that his Papers are stopp'd Universally, and his Name is used only as a Standard by which to compare whatever is mean, base, servile, & treacherous; yet this Fellow, is one of Watson's Authors.  I ask pardon, for saying so much, on this unworthy Subject, but I feel for the honor of the Colony, affected by such rascally publications. Connecticut stands in a reputable, and important point of View, with the other Colonies The more so as We have not been si lent on their History, and police, as well as on their other Connections, & their Manners. The Cause of Boston You have already seen is made by Us a Common Cause, & You must not be surprized at a Resolution, of all the Colonies, here represented, made Unanimously, to stand by, & support them to the last with Life, & Fortune, and that Resolution published on the housetop at Westminster. I hope We shall be at New Haven before the Assembly rises. It is quite uncertain whither I shall be able to procure a place for Your Son, as No Mercht. in this City will give any Answer to a Question respecting future Business untill he hears, the Report, of the doings of this Congress, but I have spoke to several kind, & worthy Freinds on the subject, who have promised to make thorough inquiry. I should prefer this City, To any place on the Continent for a Lad to serve his Time in. The Manners are simple, & pure, and their industry and Oeconomy, exceeding any thing to be expected in so populous a City. I mean by simple & pure only comparatively, for here are Debauchees, Whores, & Rogues as well as in other places, but not so Numerous. I have spoke for Four places, & may possibly obtain Them, if so I can provide for You and Your Brothers Sons. I am determined to fix a Brother, & Soninlaw of mine here, if possible. I pray that a Regulation of the Connecticut Militia may be attended to in earnest, much, perhaps all Depends on it there & throughout America. I have neither Time, nor Room to write at large, in a Word if You go on making Colonels &c in the Common old Way All is over as to a Militia. While all America is about to exhibit proofs of Virtue, let Those old Field Officers never more than Nominally so, at least sacrifice a Sound to a Reality. Compliments to Freinds.

The affidavit inclosed confirms the report in Boston about the begining of July, of a Mans being seizd by the Soldiery, put under Guard & finally sent to England. But what Remedy can the poor injurd Fellow obtain in his own Country where inter Arma silent Leges! I have written to our Friends to provide themselves without Delay with arms & Ammunition, get well instructed in the military Art, embody themselves & prepare a complete Set of Rules that they may be ready in Case they are called to defend themselves against the violent Attacks of Despotism. Surely the Laws of Self Preservation will warrant it in this Time of Danger & doubtful Expectation. One cannot be certain that a distracted Minister will yield to the Measures taken by the Congress, though they should operate the Ruin of the National Trade, until he shall have made further Efforts to lay America, as he impiously expressd it \""prostrate at his Feet.\"" I believe you will have seen before this reaches you, some further Resolves of the Congress relative to my native Town & Province together with a Letter to Gage.(2) They were sent to the Committee of Correspondence in Boston by Mr Revere who left us a Week ago, and I Suppose are or will be publishd in the papers. You will therein see the sense of the Gentlemen here of the Conduct of the General and the \""dignified Scoundrels,\"" and of the opposition made to the tyrannical Acts. I think our Countrymen discover the Spirit of Rome or Sparta. I admire in them that Patience which you have often OCTOBER 17, 1774  heard me say is characteristick of the Patriot. I regretted your Removal from Boston when you first informd me of it, but I trust it will be for the publick Advantage. Wherever you may be I am very sure you will improve your ten Talents for the publick Good. I pray God to direct and reward you. I am with due regard to Mrs Young, affectionately yours Saml Adams ""

179,dg001190,1774,Inhabitants of the Colonies,"""Inhabitants of the Colonies   [October l9-21? 1774] To the Inhabitants of the Colonies of Massachusetts Bay, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, The Counties of New Castle, Kent and Sussex on Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina, Brethren, We. the Delegates nominated and directed by the good People of the Colonies aforesaid, to meet at Philadelphia in the last Month of September, for the purposes respectively mentioned to Us by our Constituents, have in pursuance of the Trusts reposed in Us accord- ingly assembled, and taken into our most serious Consideration, the important Matters recommended to Us as Subjects of our Delibera- tions. Our Resolutions thereupon have been (published) communicated to You, and need not here be repeated: But as (our Power was derived from You, and We are of consequence accountable to You) the Situation of public Affairs grows daily more and more alarming; and as it may be more satisfactory to You to receive Information from Us in a collective Body, than in any other Manner, of those Sentiments, that have been approved upon a full & free Consultation and Discussion in Common Council by the Representatives of so great a Part of America, We esteem ourselves indispensably obliged to add this Address to the Resolutions already published. In every Case of intended Opposition by a People to their Rulers, or of one State to another, Duty to Almighty God the Creator (and Judge) of all Men and Nations, commands, that a strict and impartial Judgment be formed of all Measures leading to such Conse- quences, and of the Causes that may have provoked, or may in any degree excuse them; that, neither Affection on the one side, nor Re- sentment on the other, being permitted to confuse the Understanding, or to prejudice the Integrity of the interested, Reason may be enabled to take a dispassionate View of all (Transactions) Circumstances, and to settle the public Conduct on sure and solid Foundations of Wisdom & Justice. From Counsels thus tempered and directed arise the best (Expectations) Hopes of Divine Favor, the firmest Encouragements to those concern'd, and the strongest Recommendations to the rest of Mankind. Our Minds being deeply impress'd with a Sense of these Truths, OCTOBER 19, 1774  We have diligently, deliberately, and calmly enquired into and con- sidered the Proceedings of the legislative and executive powers of Great Britain that have excited so much Uneasiness & apprehension in these Colonies, and also the Behaviour of the Colonies. Upon the whole, so extraordinary and important is the Evidence, that We are reduced of Necessity to the ungrateful alternative of keeping Silence, and betraying the Innocent, or of speaking, and censuring those We wish to revere. In making the Choice of those distressing Difficulties; We prefer the Course dictated by Honesty and a Regard for the Wellfare of our Country. Soon after the (Accession of the present King, and the End of the last War, the Conduct of Parliament and Administration towards these Colonies began to change in a most remarkable Manner) Con- clusion of the last War, a memorable Change commenc'd in the (Conduct) Treatment of these Colonies. By a Statute made in the fourth Year of the present Reign, in a Time of profound peace, alledging the \""Expediency of new provisions & Regulations for ex tending the Commerce between Great Britain and his Majesty's Do minions in America, and the Necessity of raising a Revenue in the said Dominions, for defraying the Expences of defending, protecting, and securing the same,\"" the Commons of Great Britain undertook to give & grant to his Majesty many heavy Rates & Duties to be paid in these Colonies, the said Statute prescribing a great number of severe penalties & Forfeitures for enforcing its Observance. In two sections of this Act, a remarkable Distinction is made between the Subjects in Great Britain and those in the Colonies. By the one, the Penalties & forfeitures incurr'd there, are to be recovered in any of the King's Courts of Record at Westminster or in the Court of Exchequer in Scotland; and by the rest, the Penalties & Forfeitures incurr'd here, are to be recovered in any Court of Record or in any Court of Admiralty or Vice admiralty, at the Election of the Informer or prosecutor. The Inhabitants of these Colonies full of Confidence in the Justice and Kindness of Great Britain had scarcely Time allowed them to receive and animadvert properly on the Nature of this Act, before another, well known by the Name of the Stamp Act, past in the fifth Year of this Reign, engaged their whole Attention. By this Statute Parliament in the most explicit manner exercis'd the new power of taxing these Colonies and extended the Jurisdiction of Courts of Admiralty & Vice admiralty in the Colonies, to Matters happening within the Body of a County, on Land, directing the multitude of Penalties & Forfeitures thereby (impos'd) inflicted to be recovered in the said Courts here, but making the Distinction before mentioned, as to Penalties & Forfeitures to be recovered elsewhere.(1) In the same Year, by another Act another Tax was impos'd on  these Colonies by the establishment of several new Fees, for the Customs. In the next Year, the Stamp-Act was repealed, not because it was founded on an erroneous principle, but as the repealing Act recites, because \""the continuance thereof would be attended with many Inconveniences, and might be productive of Consequences greatly detrimental to the commercial Interests of (these Kingdoms) Great Britain.\"" In the same Year, and by the immediately following Act, it was \""declared, that his Majesty in parliament, of Right had Power to bind the People of these Colonies by Statues in all Cases whatsoever.\"" In the same Year, another Act was past for imposing Rates & Duties payable in these Colonies. In this Statute the Commons avoiding the Terms of giving and granting, \""humbly besought his Majesty, that it might be enacted\"" &c. But from a Declaration in the Preamble that the Rates & Duties (were declared to be) were \""in Lieu\"" of several others granted by the Statute first before mentioned, for raising a Revenue, and from some other Expressions, it (plainly) appears, that these Duties were intended for that purpose. In the next Year, 1767, an Act was made \""to enable his Majesty to put the Customs and other Duties in America, under the Management of Commissioners\"" &c And the King thereupon erected the present expensive Board of Commissioners; (with power to enter & search Houses &c) for the express purpose \""of carrying into Execution the several Laws relating to the Revenue & Trade in America.\"" The people of these Colonies, having after the Repeal of the Stamp Act; resign'd themselves to their antient unsuspecting Affections for their parent State, and anxious to avoid any Controversy with her, in Hopes of a favorable Alteration in Sentiments & Measures towards them, did not press their Objections against the above mention'd Statutes made subsequent to that Repeal. Administration attributing to trifling Causes, a Conduct that really proceeded from generous Motives, were encouraged in the same Year, 1767, to make a bolder Experiment on the Patience of these Colonies. By a Statute, commonly call'd the Glass, Paper & Tea Act, made fifteen months after the Repeal of the Stamp Act, the Commons of Great Britain, resumed their former Language & again undertook to \""give and grant Rates of Duties to be paid in these Colonies,\"" for the express purpose of \""raising a Revenue, to defray the Charges of the Administration of Justice, the support of Civil Government, and defending the King's Dominions\"" on this Continent. The Penalties & Forfeitures incurr'd under this Statute are to be recovered in the same Manner, with those mentioned in the foregoing Acts.  To this Statute so naturally tending to disturb the Tranquility then universal throughout the Colonies, Parliament, in the same Session added another no less extraordinary. Ever since the making the present Peace, a standing Army has been kept in these Colonies. From Respect for the Mother Country, the Innovation was not only (submitted) tolerated, but the provincial Legislatures generally, made Laws for supplying the Troops, in Conformity to the Acts of Parliament, called the Mutiny Acts, by Which the Modes of quartering & providing for the Troops in America, were directed. The Assembly of the Province of New York, having passed an Act of this kind, but differing in some Articles, as they judg'd to be just & expedient, from the Directions of the Act of Parliament made in the fifth Year of this Reign, the House of Representatives of that Colony was prohibited by a Statute made in the Session last mentioned, from making any Bill, order, Resolution or Vote, except for adjourning or chusing a Speaker, until Provision should be made by the said Assembly for furnishing the Troops within that Province, not only with all such Necessaries as were required by the Statute which they were charged with disobeying; but also with such as were required by two other subsequent Statutes, which were declared to be in Force until the twenty fourth Day of March 1769. These Statutes of the Year 1767, reviv'd the Apprehensions & Discontents that had entirely subsided on the Repeal of the Stamp Act, and Amidst (these Apprehensions and Discontents) the just Fears & Jealousies thereby occasioned, a Statute was made in the next Year, 1768, to establish Courts of Admiralty and vice admiralty on a new Model, expressly, for the End of more effectually recovering the Penalties and Forfeitures inflicted by Acts of Parliament framed for the purpose of raising a Revenue in America &c. The immediate Tendency of these Statutes, is to subvert the Right of having a Share in Legislation, by rendering Assemblies useless; the right of property, by taking the Money of the Colonists without their Consent; the Right of Trials by Jury, by substituting in their Place Trials in Admiralty & Vice Admiralty Courts, where single Judges preside, holding their commissions during pleasure, (with Salaries payable out of the Effects condemned by themselves, in place of Trials by Jury) and unduely to influence the Courts of Common Law by render [ing] the Judges thereof totally dependant on the Crown for their Salaries. These Statutes, not to mention many others exceedingly exceptionable, compared one with an other, will be found not only to form a regular System in which every part has great Force, but also a pertinacious Adherence to that System, for subjugating these Colonies, that are not and from local Circumstances cannot be represented in  (Parliament) the House of Commons to the uncontrouled and unlimited Power of (Great Britain Parliament, in violation of their undoubted & accustomed Rights and Liberties, in contempt of their well known and grievous Afflictions, their humble and repeated Sup plications. This Conduct must appear equally astonishing and unjustifiable, when it is considered, how unprovoked it has been by any Behaviour of these Colonies. From their first Settlement (to the Time of the Stamp Act) their bitterest Enemies never fix'd on any of them a Charge of Disloyalty to their Sovereign or of Disaffection to their Mother Country. In the Wars She has carried on, they have exerted themselves, whenever they were required, to give her assistance, & have rendered her Services, which she has publickly acknowledged to be extremely important. Their Fidelity, Duty, & Usefulness, during the last War, were frequently & affectionately confest by his late Majesty & the present King (and Parliament repeatedly made them Compensations for those heavy Expences and Exertions of those strenuous Efforts, which, consulting their zeal rather than their strength they had Most fully incurr'd). The Reproaches of those who are most unfriendly to the Freedom of America, are principally urged against the province of Massachusetts Bay; but, how much without Cause, is proved by the following Declarations of a person, the Truth of whose Evidence in their Favor, will not be questioned. Governor Bernard in his Speech on the 24th of April 1762, thus addresses the two Houses of Assembly--\""The Unanimity & Dis patch, with which You have complied with the Requisitions of his Majesty require my particular Acknowledgement, and it gives Me additional Pleasure to observe, that You have therein acted under no other Influence than a due sense of your Duty, both as Members of a general Empire, and as the Body of a particular province.\"" In another Speech on the 27th of May in the same Year, he says --\""Whatever shall be the Event of the War, it must be no small Satisfaction to us, that this province hath contributed its full share to the support of it. Every Thing that hath been required of it, hath been complied with; and the Execution of the powers committed to Me, for raising the provincial Troops, hath been as full and complete as the Grant of them. Never before were Regiments so easily levied, so well composed, and so early in the Field, as they have been this Year; the common people seemed to be animated with the Spirit of the General Court, and to vie with them in their Readiness to serve the King. \""The ample provision which has been already made, leaves Me nothing to ask for the immediate Service of the King.\"" (2) Such was the Conduct of the People of Massachusetts Bay, during  the last War. As to their Behaviour before that Period, it ought not to have been forgot in Great Britain, that not only on every Occasion, they had constantly & chearfully complied with the frequent royal Requisitions--but that chiefly by their vigorous Efforts, Nova Scotia was subdued in 1710, and Louisburgh in 1745. Foreign Quarrels being ended, and the domestic Disturbances that quickly succeeded on Account of the Stamp Act, being quieted by its Repeal, the Assembly of Massachusetts Bay transmitted an humble Address of Thanks to the King; and soon after pass'd a Bill for granting Compensation to the Sufferers in the Disorders occasioned by that Act. These Circumstances and the following Extracts from Governor Bernard's Letters in 1768 to the Earl of Shelburne, Secretary of State, clearly shew, With what (respect) grateful Tenderness they strove to deposite in Oblivion the unhappy occasion of the late Discords, and with what respectful Reluctance they endeavoured to escape other Subjects of future Controversy. \""The House (says the Governor) from the Time of opening the session to this Day, has shewn a Disposition to avoid all Dispute with Me; every thing having passed with as much Good humour as I could desire, except only their continuing to act in addressing the King, remonstrating to the Secretary of State, and employing a separate Agent. It is the importance of this Innovation, without any Wilfullness of my own, which induces me to make this Remonstrance, at a Time when I have a fair Prospect of having, in all other Business, nothing but good to say of the proceedings of this House.\"" Jan 21.1768.(3) \""They have acted in all things, even in their Remonstrance, with temper & Moderation; they have avoided some subjects of Dispute, and have laid a Foundation for removing some Causes of former Altercation.\"" Jan. 30. 1768. \""I shall make such a prudent & proper use of this Letter, as I hope will perfectly restore the peace & tranquility of this province. for which purpose considerable steps have been made by the House of Representatives.\"" Feb. 2.1768. The Vindication of the Province of Massachusetts Bay contained in these Letters, will have the greater Force, if it be considered, that they were written several months after the fresh Alarm given to the Colonies, by the Statutes past in the preceding Year. In this Place, it seems proper to take notice of the Insinuation in one of these Statutes, that the Interference of Parliament was necessary, to provide for \""defraying the Charge of the Administration of Justice, the support of Civil Government, and defending the King's Dominions in America. \"" As to the two first Articles of Expence, every Colony had made such provision, as by their respective Assembly the best Judges on  such Occasions, was thought expedient, & suitable to their several Circumstances. As to the last, it is well known to all men the least acquainted with American Affairs, that the Colonies established & have always defended themselves, & generally without the least assistance from Great Britain; and, that at the Time of her taxing them by the Statutes before mentioned, most of them were labouring under very heavy Debts contracted in the last War. So far were they from sparing their Money, when their Sovereign constitutionally ask'd their aids, that during the Course of that War, Parliament repeatedly made them Compensations for the Expences of those \""Strenuous Efforts,\"" which, consulting their Zeal rather than their Strength, they had cheerfully incurr'd. Severe as the Acts of Parliament before mentioned are, yet the Conduct of Administration has been equally injurious, and irritating to these devoted Colonies. (By an Order of the King, the Authority of) Under Pretence of governing them so many new Institutions so uniformly rigid & dan- gerous, have been introduc'd, as could have been expected only from incensed Masters, for collecting the Tribute or rather the Plunder of conquered Provinces. By an Order of the King, the authority of the Commander in Chief, & under him, of the Brigadiers general, in time of Peace, is rendered supreme in all the civil Governments in America; and thus an uncontroulable military Power is vested in Officers not known to the Constitution of these Colonies. A large Body of Troops & a considerable armament of ships of war, have been sent to assist in taking their Money without their consent. Expensive & oppressive Offices have been multiplied, and the Arts of Corruption industriously practised to divide & destroy. The Judges of the Admiralty & Vice Admiralty Courts, are im powered to receive their Salaries from the Effects to be condemn'd by themselves; and in the Commission to the Managers of the Customs, they are not required to apply to the Civil Magestrate, for Writs of Assistants, before they break open & enter Houses. (Salaries have been granted by the Crown to) Judges of Courts of Common Law have been made entirely dependant on the Crown for their Commissions (during Pleasure) & Salaries (have been granted by the King out of Money levied upon the People without their Consent). A Court has been established at Rhode Island for the purpose of taking Colonists to England to be tried. Humble & (dutiful) reasonable Petitions from the Representatives Of the People, have been frequently treated with Contempt; And Assemblies have been repeatedly and arbitrarily dissolved. From (a single) some few Instances it will sufficiently appear, on what Justice those Dissolutions have been founded.  The Tranquility of the Colonies having been again disturb'd, as has been mentioned, by the Statutes of the Year 1767, the Earl of Hillsborough, Secretary of State, in a Letter to Governor Bernard, dated April 22d. 1768, censures the \""presumption \"" of the House of Representatives, for \""resolving upon a Measure of so inflammatory a Nature as that of writing to the other Colonies, on the subject of their intended Representations against some late Acts of Parliament:\"" then declares, that, \""his Majesty considers this step as evidently tending to create unwarrantable Combinations, to excite an unjustifiable opposition to the constitutional Authority of parliament\""--and after wards adds--\""It is the King's Pleasure, that as soon as the General Court is again assembled, at the Time prescribed by the Charter, You should require of the House of Representatives, in his Majesty's Name, to rescind the Resolution which gave Birth to the circular Letter from the speaker, and to declare their Disapprobation of, and Dissent to that rash and hasty proceeding.\"" \""If the new Assembly should refuse to comply with his Majesty's reasonable Expectation, it is the King's Pleasure that You should immediately dissolve them.\"" This Letter being laid before the House, & the Resolutions not being rescinded according to Order, the assembly was dissolv'd. A Letter of a similar Nature was sent to other Governors, to procure Resolutions approving of the Conduct of the (House of) Represent- atives in Massachusetts Bay, to be rescinded also; & Houses of Rep- resentatives in other Colonies refusing to comply, Assemblies were dissolved. These Mandates spoke a Language, to which the Ears of English subjects had for several Generations been strangers. The Nature of Assemblies implies a power & Right of Deliberation. But these Commands proscribing the Exercise of Judgment on the propriety of the Requisitions made, left to the Assemblies only the Election between the dictated Submission or the threatened Punishment: A Punishment too (inflicted for) founded on no other Act, than such, as is deem'd innocent even in Slaves--that of agreeing in Petitions for Redress of Grievances that equally affect all. The hostile & unjustifiable Invasion of the Town of Boston, soon followed these Events in the same Year; tho that Town, the province in which it is situated, & all the Colonies, from Abhorrance of a Contest with their Parent State, permitted the Execution even of those Statutes, against which they so unanimously were complaining, remonstrating, and supplicating. Administration, (eager) determined to Subdue a Spirit of Free dom, which English Ministers should have rejoiced to cherish, (adopted the insidious Measure of combining) entered into a monopolising Combination with the East India Company, to send to this Continent vast Quantities of Tea, an Article on which Duties were  laid by a Statute, that in a particular Manner attack'd the Liberties of America & which therefore the Inhabitants of these Colonies had resolv'd not to import. The Cargo sent to South Carolina (& New York) was stored, & not allowed to be sold. Those sent to Philadel- phia, & New York, were not permitted to be landed. That sent to Boston, was destroyed by persons unknown, because the Government there, would not suffer it to be returned. On the Intelligence of these Transactions arriving in Great Britain, the public spirited Town last mentioned, was singled out for Destruction & it was determined, that the Province it belongs to, should partake of its Fate. In the last session of Parliament therefore, were past the acts for shutting up the Port of Boston, indemnifying the \""Murderers\"" of Inhabitants of Massachusetts Bay, and changing their chartered Constitution of (that Province) Government. To enforce the Acts, that Province is again invaded by a Fleet & Army. To mention these outrageous proceedings, is sufficiently to explain them. For tho it is pretended that the Province of Massachusetts Bay has been particularly disrespectful to Great Britain, Yet in truth the Behaviour of the People in other Colonies has been an equal \""Opposition to the Authority of Parliament.\"" No Step, however, has been taken against any of those Colonies. This artful behaviour conceals several Designs. It is expected, that the province of Massachusetts Bay will be (transported) iritated into some violent Actions, that may displease the rest of the Continent, or that may (be exaggerated to justify to) induce the People of Great Britain, to approve meditated Vengeance of an imprudent exasperated Ministry. If the unexampled Temper of that province shall disappoint this part of the Plan, it is hoped, the other Colonies will be so far intimidated, as to desert their (fellow sufferers) Brethren suffering in a Common Cause, and thus disunited, all may be subdued. To promote these (truly horrid Designs, Machinations,) Designs, another Measure has been pursued. In the Session of Parliament last mentioned, an Act was passed, for changing the Government of Quebec, abolishing the Assembly & trials by Jury, restoring the French Laws, establishing the Roman Catholic Religion, & extending the Limits, of that province so as to comprehend those vast Regions that lye adjoining to the northernly and westernly Boundaries of these Colonies. The authors of this arbitrary Arrangement flatter themselves, that the Inhabitants depriv'd of Liberty, & (enflamed by) artfully pro- voked against those of another Religion, will be proper Instruments for assisting in the oppressing of such as differ from them in Government & in Faith. From the Detail of Facts herein before recited, as well as from authentic Intelligence receiv'd, it is clear beyond a Doubt, that a Reso-  lution is form'd, & is now carrying into Execution, to extinguish the Freedom of these Colonies, (and reducing them into) by subjecting them to a despotic Government. At this unhappy Period, We have been authorized and directed to meet & consult together, for the Wellfare of our common Country. We accepted the important Trust with Diffidence but have endea- voured to discharge it with Integrity. Tho the (present) State of these Colonies would certainly justify other Measures, than We have advised, yet weighty Reasons determined us to prefer those which we have adopted. In the first place, it appeared to Us (an Action) a Conduct be coming the Character these Colonies have ever (uniformly) sustained, to perform even in the Face of the unnatural Distresses & imminent Dangers that surround them, every Act of Loyalty; and therefore, We were induced to offer once more to his Majesty, the Petitions of his faithful and oppressed subjects in America. Secondly, regarding with the tender affection which We knew to be so universal among our Countrymen, the People of the Kingdom, from which we derive our Original,(4) We could not (consent) forbear to regulate our Steps by an Expectation of (finding) receiving full (Satisfaction) Conviction, that the Colonists are equally dear to them. Between these provinces and that Body subsists the social Band, which We ardently wish never may be dissolv'd, and, which cannot be dissolved, untill their Minds shall become indisputably hostile, or their Inattention shall permit those who are thus hostile, to persist in prosecuting with the Powers of the Realm, the destructive Measures already operating against the Colonists; and in either Case, shall reduce the latter to such a situation, that they shall be compell'd to renounce every Regard, but that of Self preservation. Notwithstanding the Vehemence, with which Affairs have been impell'd they have not yet reach'd that fatal point. We (chuse not) do not incline to accelerate their Motion, already (alarmingly) suffici[ently] rapid. We have chosen a method of Opposition, that does not preclude a hearty Reconciliation with our Fellow Citizens on the other side of the Atlantic. We deeply deplore the urgent Necessity that presses Us to an immediate Interruption of our Commerce, that may prove injurious to them. We trust, that they will acquit Us of any unkind Intentions towards them, by reflecting, that, We subject ourselves to similar Inconveniences: that, We are (involved in such) driven by the Hands of Violence into unexperienced and unexpected public Convulsions: that, We are contending for Freedom, so often contended for by our Ancestors. The People of England will soon have an Opportunity of declaring their Sentiments concerning our Cause. In their Piety, (Virtue,) generosity, & Good sense, we repose high Confidence, and cannot,  upon a Review of past Events, be persuaded that they, the Defenders of true Religion, & the Assertors of the (Liberties of) Rights of Mankind, will take part against their affectionate protestant Colonists, in Favor of our open and their own secret Enemies whose Intrigues for several Years past, have been wholly exercis'd in Sapping the Foundations of civil & religious Liberty. Another Reason that engaged Us to prefer the (present) commercial Mode of opposition, arose from an Assurance that this Mode will prove efficacious, if it be persisted in with Fidelity & Virtue; and that your Conduct will be influenc'd by these laudable Principles cannot be questioned. Your own Salvation, and that of your posterity now depends upon Yourselves. You have already shewn (a due sense of the Blessings for which You are strugglin[g]) that you entertain a proper sense of the Injuries offered to you, & a just sense of the Blessings You are striving to retain. Against the temporary Inconveniences You may suffer from a Stoppage of Trade, You will weigh in the opposite Ballance, the endless Miseries You & your Descendants must endure from an established arbitrary Power. You will not forget the (Glory) Honour of your Country, that must (inevitably) from your Behaviour take its title in the Estimation of the World, to Glory or to shame; and You will, with the deepest Attention reflect, that if the peaceable Mode of Opposition recommended by Us, be broken and rendered ineffectual, as your cruel & haughty Enemies, from a contemptuous Opinion of your Firmness, insolently predict will be the Case, You must inevitably be (compell[ed]) reduc'd to chuse, either a more dangerous Contest, or a final and infamous Submission. (We cannot conclude this address) Motives thus cogent, arising from the emergency of your (Affairs) unhappy Condition, must excite your utmost Diligence & Zeal, to give all possible Strength & Energy to the Measures calculated for your Relief. But, We think our selves bound in Duty, to observe to You, that the schemes agitated against these Colonies have been conducted with such an Excess of Fury, that it appears probable to us, that some other Acts of violence may be committed in the approaching Winter or next Year. We judge it therefore prudent, that You should extend your Views to those Events that may happen and be in every Respect, as well prepared as You can be for every Contingency. Above all Things, we earnestly entreat You with Devotion of Spirit, Penitence of Heart, and Amendment of Life, to humble Yourselves and implore the (Assistance) Favor of Almighty God: & We fervently beseech his divine Goodness to take You into his gracious Protection.

183,dg001194,1774,Patrick Henry s Draft Address to the King,"""Patrick Henry's Draft Address to the King   [October 21?1774] (1) May it please your most excellent Majesty Graciously to receive the humble & dutifull address of your Majestys most loyal subjects the Representatives of all the American Colonys Situated between Nova Scotia & Georgia now met in general Congress. When we present ourselves before the Throne with hearts deeply impressed with a Sense of that Duty affection & Loyalty which we owe & Cordially tender to the person of your most sacred Majesty, we lament the necessity by which we are compelled to com plain of injurys of the most alarming nature. These Complaints are not the Voice of Faction, but the United Sense of North America. Several Acts & Resolutions of Parliament made since the begining of the year 1763 have violated the dearest rights & most essential privileges which belong to us as freemen & British Subjects. We mean the Acts made for raising a Revenue in America--for extend ing the Jurisdiction of the Courts of Admiralty beyond the ancient limits--The Resolutions of the two houses of Parliamt. & the Act declaring that persons who commit certain Crimes in America shall be tryed beyond the Seas--& The several Acts passed last session of OCTOBER 21, 1774  Parliamt. respecting the Town of Boston & Province of Massachusetts Bay & that for altering the Govermt. & extending the Limits of Canada.(2) These Acts & proceedings are fraught with mischief & destruction to America. Some of them take from us the power of giving & granting our own money because taxes are thereby imposed for raising a Revenue in America, and as the pretence for such interposition of Parliament is to provide a Fund for supporting the Goverment & the Administration of Justice therein, & for defending securing & protecting the Colonys, We do assure your Majesty that the Colony assemblys have made or are willing to make ample provision for defraying all the necessary expences of supporting Goverment & the administration of Justice in their respective Colonys: That our Militia if put upon a proper footing, which we are willng & desirous should be immediately done, would be sufficient for our defense in time of peace. And in case your Majesty should at any time be engaged in war, your Colonies are ready to grant supplys for raising any other forces that may be necessary.(3) By other Acts & extrajudicial Resolutions the parliament has attempted to take from us the darling privilege of Tryal by Jurys of the Vicinage & to send us far away from our Native Land to encounter a series of sufferings & Distress too great to be borne. How deplorable must be the Condition of that man who seized & shackled in America, must bid adieu to his native Country & embark for a distant one when the pains & sufferings of a tedious Imprisonment will not be alleviated by the assistance of Friends or the hope that Innocence will be acquitted. On the Contrary the unhappy sufferer far removed from the possibility of proving his innocence & from all that can minister to his Necessitys or soften his Distresses must Sink under the accumulated Misery & find no Asylum but in Death. The Town of Boston & Province of Massachusetts Bay present to our View a most alarming Example of Parliamentary Vengeance. With Greif & astonishment we behold those powers of Goverment which so long harmonized with America now formed into dangerous Efforts for her destruction. Judge Royal Sir what must be our feelings when we see our fellow subjects of that Town & Colony suffering a Severity of punishment of which the British History gives no Example, & the Annals of Tyranny can scarcely equal. And when we see in the Fate of this our sister Colony that which awaits us, we are filled with the most terrible apprehensions--Apprehensions which are heighten'd & increased almost to Despair, when we turn our Attention to the Quebec Act. In vain do your Majestys faithfull Subjects look around them for a ground to hope that they or their Posterity can be safe free or happy in the neighbourhood of a Goverment so much at variance with  the true Spirit of English liberty. The Religion of Rome bloody Idol- atrous & strongly inimical to Protestantism will ever stimulate its Votarys to attempts fatal to those who differ from them in Religious & Civil Policy. Strongly impressed with these Sentiments we chear fully contributed our blood & treasure to the conquest of that country in the late war confident that we should thereby change a dangerous & hostile neighbour into a British Province & strengthen the Protestant interest & the cause of Liberty. Our amazement therefore is indeed extreme to see these well-grounded hopes disappointed, & that Popery & the Laws of France have found Establishment & Patronage in a British Parliament. The local extent assigned for the Operation of this fatal scheme of Goverment is an additional Circumstance to make it dangerous & alarming to the ancient British Colonys. Thus encompassed with Injurys apprehensions & Dangers, your faithfull American Subjects look up to your Majesty for Assistance & Releif. We most earnestly entreat you Royal Sire to interpose your Royal Influence to procure us Redress of these our Greivances. We are distressed with the most Poignant feelings, by that prospect which the present System adopted by Parliament holds up to our view. Unworthy submission, or unjust Resistance are Equally far from US & abhorrent to our Ideas. Either would render unfit objects of yr. Majestys Paternal regards--Drive us not to Despair--Urge US not to the last extremity most gracious Sovereign. We can never submit to the Encroachments of the British Parliament. Compell us not therefore to that Situation in which All is Gloom & horror, & from whence no Ray of Peace or Comfort can be discern'd. All we ask is that we may be restored to that State in which America stood at the Close of the last War. We desire no new privileges. Restore us royal Sir our Ancient & indubitable rights & we are contented. We shall then return with Joy & Gladness to that friendly intercourse & mutually beneficial commerce so much to be desired by the mother Country & the Colonys, hut which has of late been so unhappily disturbed. Thus restored to peace & tranquility we shall bless the royal hand that was held forth for our Deliverance. We shall rejoice under the Dominion of a Prince to whom Allegiance Affection & Gratitude shall concur to bind us by their most sacred ties. Your Majestys faithfull Americans will ever be ready to offer their blood & treasure to Support your Majestys illustrious house. And we trust that no length of Time no distance of Situation or change of Circumstances shall ever efface the remembrance of that Signal interposition of yr. Majesty upon which we rely for Deliverance from the wicked At tempts of those Ministers whose Designs are fatal to the true interests of yr. Majesty & destructive to all that is dear to us.  ""

184,dg001195,1774,Richard Henry Lee s Draft Address to the King,"""Richard Henry Lee's Draft Address to the King   [October21? 1774] (1) May it please your most excellent Majesty Graciously to permit your dutiful Subjects the Representatives of your loyal People in North America to approach the Throne and humbly to entreat the royal attention to those Grievances, which have for ten years past, with increasing violence threatned danger and ruin to Antient Constitutional Rights which your Majesties faithful Subjects in this western world have long enjoyed under your Majesties royal Progenetors. The history of these Colonies, may it please your Majesty, is one continued proof of unshaken loyalty to their Sovereigns, of unremitting zeal for the glory and prosperity of Great Britain, to which, their active labors have much contributed. No rebellions, no traiterous dissaffections have ever disgraced their story, or disturbed the repose of the Mother Country. These truths may sufficiently prove to your Majesty, that nothing less than imminent dangers and most oppressive Grievances could now move a numerous people of such steady and persevering Loyalty. Such, may it please your Majesty, are certain Acts of your British Parliament passed in the 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th & years of your Majesties reign, which destroy every idea of property in your Majesties American dominions, and in many cases deprive the Subject of his antient, equitable, and legal trial by Jury, and unncessarily endanger his life, OCTOBER 21, 1774  by ordaining its trial in far distant Courts, where want of evidence and assistance of friends may conspire to destroy the most innocent of your Majesties subjects. We say unnecessarily may it please your Majesty, because your Majesties Courts, with compitent Laws, are here open to the punishment of all Offenders who shall dare to commit Treason, or disturb the quiet of Society. It is not to be wondered, may it please your Majesty, that apprehensions of distress and danger do greatly disturb your people in North America, when they see such extensive and unexampled Oppressions fixed by military force on many thousands of your Majesties brave and loyal people of the Massachusetts Bay, without their ever having been called Upon to answer, or heard in their defence, repugnant, as they have thought, to the practise of the just in all Ages. Added to these most alarming proceedings, we have the missfortune Great Sir, to see an arbitrary government and the Roman Catholic religion established in Canada, now so extended along the borders of the Colonies, as to comprehend the greater part of North America; a Religion equally destructive of the indepenc'y of Princes and the Civil and Religious liberties of Mankind, so fatally fixed on the ruin of Protestants, that the Laws of England have, since the Reformation carefully guarded against its admission into the British dominions. Sensible, may it please your Majesty, that the greatness and glory of the Sovereign are best sup ported by the freedom and happiness of his people, and devoted as your Majesties faithful American Subjects are to the Protestant succession in the House of Brunswick, and most earnestly wishing to preserve in its greatest purity the excellent Constitution of England as settled at the Revolution, they feel with the deepest affliction that their happiness and security can never exist with those violent and unconstitutional Councils which are ever ready to be suggested by Tory Counsellors whither in or out of place, Men, whose principles of Government, however artfully concealed, are at fatal enmity with Revolution principles and the Hanoverian Succession. May we be permitted Most gracious Sovereign to assure your Majesty that no machinations of such Men, or any other of your Majesties Enemies shall ever succeed, if they can be prevented by the fullest exertion of the lives and fortunes of your Majesties loyal and affectionate Subjects in North America. Unpractised in Courts and unused to dissemble, we most humbly pray your Majesty to pardon the freedom with which duty and loyalty to our Sovereign compels us to declare that our apprehensions of danger can never cease so long as the unwise and destructive Councils of the Lords Bute, Mansfield, and North are suffered to approach the Throne. The grievances of your Majesties faithful American Subjects are with great humility, presented, we hope, for the favorable attention of our Sovereign, the Father of all his People.

188,dg001199,1774,John Dickinson s Draft Address to the King,"""John Dickinson's Draft Address to the King   [October 22?1774] (1) To the King May it please your Majesty, We your Majesty's faithful Subjects, the Delegates (2) of the Colonies of New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay, Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Penn- sylvania, The Counties of New Castle Kent & Sussex on Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina & South Carolina, in General Congress met, by this, our humble Petition, beg Leave to represent the Grievances of your loyal People in America. By several Acts of Parliament made in the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth Years of your Majesty's Reign, Duties are imposed on the Inhabitants of these Colonies, for the Purpose of raising a Revenue, and the Powers of Admiralty Courts are extended beyond their antient Limits, whereby the Property of the said Inhabitants is taken from them without their Consent, the Trial by Jury in many civil Cases is abolish'd, enormous Forfeitures are incurr'd for slight Offences, vexatious Informers are exempted from paying Damages to which they are justly liable, and oppressive Security is required from Owners, before they are allowed to defend their Right. Resolution of Parlt. th [at] Col [onis] ts may be tried under 35 H. 8. Another Statute made in the twelfth Year of your Majesty's Reign, directs, that persons charged with committing any Offence therein described in any Place out of the Realm of Great Britain, may be indicted & tried for the same in any Shire or County within the said Realms whereby Inhabitants of these Colonies may in several capital Cases be deprived of a Trial by their Peers of the Vicinage. In the last Session of Parliament, an Act was past, for blocking up the Port of Boston; another for indemnifying \""Murderers\"" of Colonists in the Province of Massachusetts Bay, from legal Punishment, by ordering them to be carried to Great Britain for Trial; a third, for OCTOBER 22, 1774  altering the chartered Constitution of Government in that province; and a fourth, for extending the Limits of Canada, & establishing the Roman Catholic Religion, and an absolute Government on a French model,(3) throughout those vast Regions that border on the westernly and northernly Boundaries of the free, Protestant, English Settle ments.(4) To a Sovereign who \""glories in the Name of Briton,\"" the bare Recital of these Acts will justify the loyal Subjects who fly to the Foot of his Throne, and implore his Clemency for protection from them. From these Sources too hastily and unkindly opened have flowed these Distresses, Dangers, Fears & Jealousies that overwhelm your Majesty's dutiful Colonists with Afflictions; and We defy our most inveterate & subtle Enemies to trace the unhappy Differences be tween Great Britain & these Colonies from an earlier period or from other Causes than We have assigned. Had they proceeded on our Part from a restless Levity of Temper, the unjust Impulses of Ambition, or the artful Suggestions of Seditious Persons, We should merit the opprobious Terms frequently bestowed upon Us, by those We revere. But so far from promoting Innovations, We have only oppos'd them; and can be charged with no other Crime, than that of receiving Injuries, and being sensible of them. Had Almighty God been pleased to give Us our Existence in a Land of Slavery, the Sense of our Condition might have been mitigated by the Force of Education & Habit.(5) But Thanks be to his adorable Goodness, We were Born the Heirs of Freedom, and ever enjoyed our Right under the Auspices of your royal Ancestors, whose Family was seated on the British Throne, to secure a pious & gallant Nation from the Popery and Despotism, meditated by a superstitious, and inexorable Tyrant. Your Majesty justly rejoices, We are confident, that your Title to the Crown is thus founded on the Title of your People to Liberty; and therefore, We doubt not, but your royal Wisdom must approve the Sensibility, that teaches your subjects anxiously to guard the Blessing they received from Divine Providence, and thereby to prove the performance of that Compact, that elevated the illustrious House of Brunswick to the Dignity it now possesses. The Apprehensions of being degraded into a State of Servitude from the preeminent Rank of English Freemen, while our Minds retain the strongest Love of Liberty, and clearly foresee the Miseries preparing for our Posterity, excite Emotions in our Breasts which tho We cannot describe, We should not wish to conceal.(6) By giving this faithful Information, We do all in our Power to promote the great Objects of your royal Cares, the Tranquility of your Government and the Wellfare of your People. Our Duty to your Majesty, and Regard for the Preservation of  ourselves and our Posterity, the primary Obligations of Nature & of Society, command Us to entreat your royal Attention; and as Your Majesty enjoys the signal Distinction of reigning over Freemen, and therefore of being acquainted with their Language, We cannot ap- prehend our Address will be displeasing.(7) Your royal Indignation will rather fall, We hope, on those designing and dangerous Men, who (8) for several Years past incessantly employed to dissolve the Bonds of Society by (9) prosecuting the most desperate and irritating projects of Oppression, have at Length compell'd Us by the Force of accumulated Injuries too numerous & too severe to be any longer tolerable, to disturb your Majesty's Repose by our Complaints. These Sentiments are extorted from Hearts, that much more willingly would bleed in your Majesty's Service; yet so greatly have We been misrepresented, that a Necessity has been alledged of taxing Us, (10) to defray the Charge of the Administration of Justice, the support of Civil Government, and the Defence & Protection & Security of the Colonies. But We beg Leave to assure your Majesty, that such adequate Provision has been made for defraying the two first Articles of Expences as has been judged by the Legislatures of the several Colonies just & suitable to their respective Circumstances; and for the Defence Protection & Security of the Colonies, their Militias if properly regulated, as they earnestly desire may immediately be done, would be fully sufficient, at least in Time of Peace; and in Case of War, your faithful Colonists will be ready and willing as they ever have been, when constitutionally required, to demonstrate their Loyalty to your Majesty by exerting their most strenuous Efforts in granting Supplies and raising Forces. Knowing, that no Subjects in the British Dominions exceed them in affectionate Attachment to your Majesty's person, Family, & Government, they too dearly prize the Priviledge of expressing that Attachment by those proofs, that are honorable to the Prince who receives them and to the People that gives them, ever to resign it to any Body of Men upon Earth. Had they been permitted to enjoy in Quiet the Inheritance left them by their Forefathers, they would now have been peaceably, & cheerfully & usefully employed in recommending themselves by every Testimony of Devotion to your Majesty, & of veneration to their Parent State;(11) and tho now exposed to unexpected & unnatural Scenes of Distress by a Contention with that Nation in whose parental Guidance on all important affairs they have hitherto with filial Reverence constantly and implicitly trusted, and therefore they can derive no Instruction in their present unhappy Circumstances from any former Experience, and however successful their Enemies may be in bringing upon them fresh Censures and Misfortunes, yet no human Power can deprive them of the encouraging Consciousness, that they have acted as became free and honest Men and (whatever  Censures) or Misfortunes the artifices of their Enemies may bring upon them, they cannot he deprived of a encouraging Consciousness, that they have acted as became free and honest Men; and therefore they doubt not, but the Purity of their Intention and the Integrity of their Conduct will justify them at that grand Tribunal, before which all Mankind must submit to Judgment. Gracious Sovereign, We your Majesty's faithful subjects, presume not to request any Diminution of the Prerogative, nor the Grant of any new Right in our Favor. Your Majesty's Authority is essential to the due Government of the Colonies; and if the Grievances We suffer by Means of the several Statutes before mentioned are redress'd, We are well assured, that the former Harmony between Great Britain & the Colonies, so necessary to the Happiness of both, and so ardently wish'd for by the latter, will be restored. We therefore humbly beseech your Majesty, to use your royal Authority & Recommendation to procure our Relief.(12) That your Majesty may enjoy every Felicity, thro a long & glo- rious Reign, over loyal & happy Subjects, and that your Descendants may inherit your Prosperity & Dominions, till Time shall be no more, is and always will be our sincere & fervent Prayer.(13) We only ask for Peace, Liberty, and Safety. We presume not to sollicit any Diminution of the Prerogative, nor the Grant of any new Right in our Favor. The royal Authority and our subordinate Connection with Great Britain, We shall always carefully & zealously endeavour to support & maintain.(l4) Permit Us then, Gracious Sovereign, in the Name of all your faithful People in America, with the utmost Humility to implore You, for the Honor of Almighty God, whose pure Religion our Enemies are undermining; for your Glory, which can be advanced only by rendering your Subjects happy, and keeping them united; for the Interests of your Family, depending on an adherence to the Principles that enthroned it; for the Safety & Welfare of your Kingdoms & Dominions, threatened with almost unavoidable Dangers & Distresses; that your Majesty as the loving Father of your People connected by the same Bands of Law, Loyalty, Faith, and Blood, tho dwelling in various Countries, will not suffer the transcendent Relation formed by these Tyes to be violated, in uncertain Expectation of Effects, that if attained, never can compensate for the Calamities thro which they must be gained. We, therefore, most earnestly beseech your Majesty, that Your royal Authority and Interposition may be used for our Relief: and that a gracious and a present Answer may be, given to this Petition.(15) ""

No Learning --No Grace of Action or Utterance--but an honest Zeal. He told us several good Stories. One was, that he was once preaching in Virginia and said that those Ministers who taught the People that Salvation was to be obtained by good Works, or Obedience, were leading them to ruin.

194,dg001205,1774,John Dickinson s Draft Letter to Quebec,"""John Dickinson's Draft Letter to Quebec   [October 24-2671774] (1) To the Inhabitants of the Province of Quebec Friends & Fellow Subjects We the Delegates of the Colonies of New Hampshire &c (mentioning them in order) deputed by the Inhabitants of the said Colonies to represent them in a General Congress at Philadelphia in the Province of Pennsylvania, to consult together concerning the best Methods to obtain Redress of our afflicting Grievances, having ac- cordingly assembled, and taken into our most serious Consideration the State of public Affairs on this Continent, have thought proper to address Your Province as a Member therein deeply interested. When the Fortune of War after a gallant and glorious Resistance OCTOBER 24, 1774  against superior Numbers had incorporated You with the Body of British Subjects, We rejoiced in the truly valuable Addition both on our own and your Account, expecting, as Courage & Generosity are naturally united, our brave Enemies would become our (best) hearty Friends, and that the Divine Being would bless the Dispensations of his overruling Providence to You, by securing to You & your latest posterity, the inestimable advantages of a free British Consitution of Government, which it is the Priviledge of all British Subjects [to] enjoy. These Hopes were confirmed by the Proclamation issued in the Year 1763, plighting the public Faith for your full Enjoyment of those advantages therein solemnly promised. Little did We imagine, that any succeeding Ministers would so audaciously and cruelly abuse the royal Authority, as not only to with hold from You the irrevocable Rights to which You were thus justly entitled,(2) Rights purchased from arbitrary Monarchs by our Ances- tors, at the Expence of their Blood, but, with a detestable Cunning even to direct the Exercise of those Rights in such an incidious Manner, as might most effectually tend to prejudice You against the proffored Blessings, and incline You to think, that You only rejected a rough Casket belonging to others, while You should throw away inclosed Jewells above all Price, your own legal property, that your base Deceivers might profit by your innocent Error. But since We have liv'd to see the unexpected Time, when Ministers of this flagitious Temper have dared to violate the most sacred Compacts & obligations, and as You, educated under another Form of Government, have artfully been kept from discovering the unspeakable Worth of that Form You are now undoubtedly entitled to, We esteem it our Duty, for the weighty Reasons herein after mentioned, to explain to You, as well We can, the Nature of some of its most important Branches. \""In every human Society,\"" says the celebrated Marquis Beccaria, following the steps of the immortal Montesquieu in impressing sentiments of Humanity, \""there is an Effort continually tending to confer on one Part the height of Power and Happiness, and to reduce the other to the extreme of Weakness & Misery. The intent of good Laws, is to oppose this Effort, and to diffuse their Influence, universally, & equally.\"" These few Lines have intensely collected into a small Compass, the (Principles) Causes of almost all Civil Discords. Rulers stimulated by the pernicious \""Effort,\"" and Subjects, animated by the just \""Intent of opposing good Laws against it,\"" have that vast Variety of Dissensions, that fill the Histories of so many Nations. All these Histories demonstrate the Truths of this simple Position, that to live by the Will of one Man or sett of Men, is the production of Misery to  all Men. On the solid Foundation of this Principle, has been rear'd up the Fabrick of the British Constitution, with such a Strength, as for Ages to defy Time, Tyranny, Treachery, internal and foreign Wars: And upon this Model, tho on a smaller Scale, has been form'd the Constitution of each British Colony, and that also, (by an indissoluble Right vested in you are) with which by an unalienable Title You have been invested. The first grand Right under all these, is that, of the People having a Share in (the Government of themselves, By this, is secured to them) their own Government by their Representatives chosen by themselves and in Consequence thereof, being ruled by Laws which they themselves approve, not by Edicts of Men over whom they have no Controul. This is a Bulwark surrounding and (wholly) defending their property, which by their honest Cares and Labours they have acquired, so that no portions of it can legally be taken from them, but with their full & free Consent, when they in their Judgment deem it just & necessary to give them for public Services, and precisely direct the easiest, cheapest, and most equal Method, in which it shall be collected. The Influence of this Right extends still farther. If Money is wanted by Governors who have in any Manner oppressed the People, they may retain it, until their Greivances are redrest, & thus peaceably procure Relief, without trusting to despised Petitions, or disturbing their domestic Tranquility. The next great Right, is that of Trial by Jury.(3) This provides, that neither Life, Liberty, or property can be taken from the Possessor, until twelve of his Countrymen and Peers, clear of Objections, of his Vicinage, who from that Neighbourhood may reasonably be suppos'd to be acquainted with his Character and the Characters of the Witnesses,(4) upon a fair Trial and full Enquiry, face to face, in open Court, before (the assembled Country such of) as many of the People as chuse to attend, shall pass their impartial Sentence upon Oath, against him; a Sentence, that cannot injure him, without injuring their own Reputation, & probably their Interest also, as the Question may turn on Points, that in some Degree concern the general Welfare; and if it does not, their Verdict may form a Precedent, that on a similar Trial of their own, may militate against them. (The last Right We shall mention, relates to personal) Another Right relates merely to the Liberty of the person. If a Subject is seiz'd & imprisoned, tho by Government, he may by Virtue of this Right immediately obtain a writ term'd a Habeas Corpus from a Judge whose sworn Duty it is to grant it, and thereupon (be brought before him; and it is the Duty of the Judge instantly to discharge him, unless the Commitment is founded on Law.) procure any illegal Restraint to be inquired into & redress'd.  (The last Right We shall mention) A fourth Right is that of holding Lands by the Tenure of easy Rents, and not by the Tenure of rigorous and oppressive services frequently forcing the possessors from their Families & their Business to perform what ought to be done in all well regulated States, by Men hired for the Purpose. The last Right We shall mention, regards the Freedom of the Press. The Importance of this consists, besides the advancement of Truth, Science, Morality & art, in general, in its Diffusion of liberal Sentiments on the administration of Government, its ready Commu- nication of Thoughts between Subjects, & its consequential promotion of Union among them, whereby Oppressive Officers are sham'd or intimidated into a more honourable & just Mode of Conducting Af fairs. These are the invaluable Rights that form a considerable Part of that mild (and equitable) System of Government, that sending its equitable Energy thro all Ranks & Classes of Men, defends the poor from the rich, the weak from the powerful, the industrious from the rapacious, the peaceable from the violent, the Tenants from the Lords, and all from their Superiors. These are the Rights without which a people cannot be free & happy, & under the protecting & encouraging virtue of which, these Colonies have hitherto so amazingly flourish'd & increas'd, and which we are with one Mind resolved never to resign but with our Lives. These are the Rights to which You are also entitled, & ought at this Moment in perfection to (enjoy) exercise; and what is offered to You by the late Act of Parliament in their Place? Liberty of Conscience in your Religion? No. God gave it to You; and the temporal Powers with which You have been and are connected firmly stipulated for your Enjoyment of it. If Laws divine and human could secure it against the future despotic Caprices of the wickedest Men, it was secured before. Are the French Laws in civil Cases restored? It seems so. But observe the cautious Kindness of the Ministers who pretend to be your Benefactors. The Words of the Statute are--that those \""Laws shall be the Rule until they shall be varied or altered by any Ordinances of the Governor and Council.\"" Is the \""Certainty & Lenity of the criminal Law of England, & its Benefits & Advantages,\"" commended in the said Statute, & said to \""have been sensibly felt by you\"" secured to You and your Descendants? No. They too are subjected to arbitrary \""alterations\"" by the Governor & Council; and a Power is expressly reserved of appointing \""such Courts of criminal, civil and ecclesiastical Jurisdiction as shall be thought proper.\"" Such is the precarious Tenure of mere Will by which You hold your Lives & Religion. Have You an Assembly composed of worthy Men elected by Yourselves & in whom You can confide, to make Laws  for You, to watch over your Wellfare, & to direct in what quantity and manner, your Money shall be taken from you? No. The Powers of making Laws for you, are lodg'd in the Governor & Council, all of them dependant upon & removable at the Pleasure of a Minister. Be sides, by another late Statute, You are subjected to Excise Regulations, the Horror & detestation of all free States, thus wresting your property from You by the most odious of Taxes (These are the insulting Favors of a Ministry) and in the very Act altering your Government, and intended to flatter You, it is expressly declared that You \""Yourselves within your several Towns & Districts shall not assess, levy, & apply any Rates & Taxes within such Towns & Districts respectively, but for the inferior purposes of making Roads, & erect ing & repairing public Buildings, or for other local Conveniences.\"" Why this degrading Distinction? Ought not the honestly acquired property of Canadians to be as sacred as that of Britons & therefore dependant on their own voluntary Gifts & Grants? Have they not Sense enough to (manage) attend to other public Affairs than gathering Stones from one Place, & piling them up in another? Unhappy People! Who are not only injured but insulted; not only Ruin'd by your oppressors but trampled under their Feet; and after all deridingly told, that the whole is for your Good. Nay morel With such a superlative Contempt of your Understanding & Spirit, has an insolent Ministry presumed to think of you our respectable [. . .] fellow subjects, as firmly to persuade themselves, that your Gratitude for the Injuries & Insults they have recently offer'd to You, will engage You to take up arms, & render yourselves the ridicule & Detestation of the World, by becoming poor Tools in their Hands, to assist them in taking that Freedom from Us, which they have treacherously denied to You; the unavoidable Consequence of which Attempt, if successful, would be the Extinction of all hope of You or your posterity being ever restored to Freedom. What would your Countryman the immortal Montesquieu, (an Honor not only to his Nation but to Human Nature, say, were he living) have said to such a Plan of Domination? Hear his Words with an Intenseness of Thought suited to the (Magnitude) Importance of the Subject. \""In a free State, every Man, who is supposed a free Agent ought to be concern'd in his own Government: so the legislative should reside in the whole Body of the People--or their Representatiues.\"" \""The political Liberty of the subject is a Tranquility of Mind, arising from the opinion each person has of his Safety. In order to have this Liberty, it is requisite the Government be so constituted, as that one Man need not be afraid of another. When the power of making Laws and the power of executing them are united in the same persons, or in the same Body of Magistrates, there can be no Liberty, because Apprehensions may arise, least the  same Monarch or Senate should enact tyrannical Laws, to execute them in a tyrannical Manner.\"" \""The Power of Judging should be exercised by persons taken from the Body of the People, at certain Times of the year, and pursuant to a Form & Manner prescribed by Law (in order to erect a tribunal that should last only as long as Necessity requires.\"").\"" \""There is no liberty, if the power of judging be not separated from the legislative and executive Powers.\"" Apply these decisive Maxims sanctified by the Authority of a Name which all Europe reveres, to your own State. You have a Gov- ernor vested with the executive Powers or the Powers of Administra- tion. In him and in your Council, is lodg'd the Power of making Laws. You have Judges, who are to decide every Cause affecting your Lives, Liberty, or property. Here is indeed an Appearance of the several Powers being separated & distributed into different Hands for Checks one upon another, the (sole Method) only effectual Mode ever invented by the Wit of Man to promote their Freedom & Prosperity. But scorning to be illuded by a tinsel'd Outside, & exerting the natural Sagacity of French men, examine the specious Device, & You will find it to use an Expression of holy Writ, \""a painted sepulcre\"" for burying your Lives, Liberty & property. Your Judges, & your Legislative Council, as it is called, are dependant on your Governor; and he is dependant on [. . .] the Servants of the Crown in Great Britain. The legislative, executive, & judging Powers, all move on the nods of a Minister. Priviledges (& every) Immunity lasts no longer than his smiles. When he frowns, their feeble Forms dissolve. What can protect your property from taxing Edicts, & the rapacity of necessitous, & cruel Masters? Your persons from Letters de Cachet, Gaols, Dungeons, & oppressive Services? Your Lives & general Liberty from arbitrary & unfeeling Rulers? We defy You casting your View upon every side, to discover a single Circumstance promising the faintest Hope of Liberty to You, but an entire adoption into the Union of these Colonies. What advice would the truly great Man before mentioned give You,(5) if he knew, that We your numerous & powerful neighbours (& Friends), animated by a just Love of our invaded Freedoms & united by indissoluble Bonds of Affection & Interest, call'd upon You by every obligation of Regard for Yourselves and your Children, as We now do, to join Us in our righteous Contest, to make Common Cause with Us therein, and take a noble Chance, for emerging from a humiliating Subjection under Governors, Intendants, & military Tyrants, into the firm Rank & Condition of English Freemen, whose Custom it is deriv'd from their Ancestors, to make those tremble, who dare to think of making them miserable? His Language would be this--\""Seize, my beloved Countrymen the opportunity presented to You by Providence itself. You have been  conquered into Liberty, if you act as you ought. This Work is not of Man. You are a small People, compared to those whose open arms invite You into Fellowship. (They are at Your Doors. You must inevitably be their Friend.s or their Enemies. They are at Your Doors. Their Hostility must be incessant, unaltered, not to be guarded against. Great Britain is at a very [great] Distance. Her Fleets and Armies.

For their own Sakes, they never will desert or betray you. The Injuries of Boston, have rous'd every Colony to an Association, from Nova Scotia to Georgia. You are the only Link wanting to complete the bright & strong Chain of Union. Nature (intended you for the[. . .]) has join'd your Country to theirs. Do You join Your politicial Interests. Be assured, that the Happiness of a People inevitably depends on their Liberty, & their Spirit to assert it. The value & Extent of the (Blessin[gs]) advantages tendered to You are immense. Heaven grant, You may not discover them to be Blessings, as the unwise generally do, after they have bid an eternal Adieu.\"" (Be not alarm'd with false Fears of Differences in religious Sentiments. The united Body of Swiss Cantons is happily composed of Roman Catholic & Protestant States, & defy the World to hurt them.) We are too well acquainted with the Liberality of Sentiment distinguishing your Nation, to imagine, that Difference of Religon will prejudice You against a hearty Amity with Us.(6) You know that the transcendent Nature of Freedom elevates those who unite in her Cause, above all such low-minded Infirmities. The Swiss Cantons furnish a memorable proof of this Truth. Their union is compos'd of Roman catholic & protestant States, living in the utmost Concord & Peace with one another and thereby enabled ever since they bravely vindicated their Freedoms, to defy and defeat every Tyrant that has invaded them. We know, there are among You, & among all Societies, Men who prefer their own Interest to the Welfare of their Country. The Temper of such selfish persons renders them incredibly active in opposing all public spirited Measures, from an Expectation of being well rewarded for their sordid Industry, by their Superiors to whom those Measures are displeasing.(7)We doubt not, but these Men will throw in your Way every Objection & Difficulty, their partial Aims can forge or form. But We address the Body of the Canadian People, on a subject of the last Importance, not to one or another Class or Rank among them, but to the whole. You will therefore, We doubt not, be upon your Guard against those, who by their offices & Connections are led to pursue private Interests at the Expence of the general. All their glosses & Calumnies cannot depreciate with sensible & honest  Men, the laudable Cause in which We are already engaged, and re quest You to share. This Our Invitation asks You not to commence Acts of Hostility against the Government of our Common Sovereign. It is only that You will consult your own Glory & Welfare, and not suffer Your selves to be enveigled or intimidated by infamous Ministers so far as to become their Instruments, and plunge your Swords into our innocent Bosoms, that ardently wish You every kind of Liberty & Felicity, and will rejoice to embrace You a loving Brethren in one social Band, founded on the generous Principles of equal Liberty, & cemented by such an Exchange of endearing Offices as to render it perpetual. In Order to complete this highly desireable Union, We submit to your Consideration, whether it may not be expedient for You to meet together in your several Towns & Districts & (chuse Representatives) elect Deputies, who afterwards meeting in a provincial Congress, may chuse Delegates to represent your Province in the Continental Congress to be held at Philadelphia (in the Province of Pennsylvania) on the Day of 1775. In the present Congress beginning on the fifth Day of the last Month, and continued by adjournments to this Day, it has been with universal Pleasure and an unanimous Vote resolved, that You should be invited to accede to our Confederation, which has no other Objects, than the perfect Security of the natural & civil Rights of all the constituent Members according to their respective Circumstances, and the Preservation of a happy & lasting Connection with Great Britain on the great, & salutary & constitutional Principles herein before mentioned. For effecting these Purposes, We have addrest an humble & loyal Petition to his Majesty, praying Relief of our Grievances; and have associated to stop all Importations from Great Britain & Ireland after the first Day of next December, & all Exportations to those Kingdoms & the West Indies, after the tenth Day of next September, unless the said Grievances are redrest. That Almighty God may incline your Minds to approve our (just) equitable & necessary Measures, to add yourselves to Us, to put your Fate whenever You suffer Injuries you are determined to oppose not on the small Force of your single province, but on the consolidated Powers of North America, and may grarit to our joint Exertions an Event happy as our Cause is just, is the (sincere &) fervent Prayer of Us your sincere & affectionate Friends & Fellow Subjects.

200,dg001211,1774,Thomas Lynch to Ralph Izard,"""Thomas Lynch to Ralph Izard   Dear sir: Philadelphia, October 26, 1774. On my arrival here, I wrote you (1) the occasion of it. I now have the pleasure of enclosing to you a pamphlet, which contains the result.(2) There remains only an address to the Canadians and the pe- tition to the King, to complete all our works, and these will be soon printed in England; should they reach you abroad, please consider whether their being translated into French and Dutch, may not have a good effect, as we shall want supplies of woollens and other goods from them, in case our mother country, (as it is called,) continues her oppression. The New England men, continue a behavior truly heroic. Without rashness, or any tumultuous proceedings that belong to mobs, they oppose a steady, manly, cool and regular conduct, neither declining nor precipitatin, war. I saw a gentleman a few days ago, who was at Cambridge, when the men who had met to oblige the councillors and judges to resign their offices, received intelligence that Gage was marching his little army to attack them. He declares that this news occasioned not the least appearance of hurry or confusion. The men who were armed, prepared to receive their enemy; the unarmed, hasted home, and brought their arms. Their numbers being but little superior, shows they will not decline an equal combat. If so, where is England to find an army to encounter two hundred thousand of these same New Englanders, besides at least five hundred thousand others, in the rest of America, who have solemnly engaged in the same cause. I think I mentioned a little speech, made by an Assemblyman, (it is said of Virginia.) \""I will raise and support, one thousand men at my expense, as long as you shall want them, and march at their head, wherever you direct.\"" There are many such men in America.(3) I remember to have heard, that Amherst had told the King, that he would undertake to march five thousand men, from one end of the continent to the other, notwithstanding the opposition of all the inhabitants. If the story is true, his successor seems quite of a contrary opinion. Indeed, if the former took up that idea from the provincials, he will consider an army, formed out of the dregs of the people, as a very different thing from the yeomen of the country, acting voluntarily in the immediate defence of their liberty and property. I enclose a newspaper, to show the temper of the people of Maryland, as a specimen of that which prevails in all the colonies. In short, I think you may venture to pronounce that America, though most sincerely attached to England and desirous of a perpetual union, will, by force only, be brought to admit of domination; and they may learn from the case of Corsica what force to apply to America, OCTOBER 26, 1774  how it is to be sent here, and how supported when it is. Indeed, the notion is ridiculous and absurd. These middle colonies were suspected of great lukewarmness, but since we have been here, a great alteration is visible in that matter. I return this day to Carolina with Mrs. Lynch. With best regards to Mrs. Izard, I am, dear sir, &c.

204,dg001215,1774,John Dickinson to Arthur Lee,"""John Dickinson to Arthur Lee   Dear Sir, Philadelphia October 27th 1774 Yesterday the Congress broke up. You will immediately know their proceedings from Publications. Colonists have now taken such Ground, that Great Britain must relax, or inevitably involve herself in a Civil War, likely in all human probability to overwhelm her with a Weight of Calamities, in Comparison of which \""plus quam civilia bella,\"" the Contentions, between the Houses of York & Lancaster, or the Distractions of the last Century were gentle Misfortunes. A determined & unanimous Resolution animates this Continent, firmly & faithfully to support the Common Cause, to the utmost Extremity, in this great Sturggle for the Blessing of Liberty, that alone can render Life worth holding. I grieve for the Fate of a brave & generous Nation plung'd by a few profligate Men, into such Scenes of unmerited & inglorious Dis tress. Let her rouse her natural, noble Spirit--be true to herself, & of course be true to Us. Let her not so far adopt the base yet Visionary Schemes of Fools & Knaves, that She may think her Dignity concern'd to maintain the projects of those, whom her Justice commands her to punish. Give us the Butes, Mansfields, Norths, Bernards & Hutchinsons &c whose Falsehoods and Misrepresentations, have enflamed the People--Call not their Cause, the Cause of Great Britain--Throw all Errors & occasions of Dissatisfaction on their guilty heads. A new Ministry of such a Character, that England & America both can trust, may do great Things; Especially if a considerable Change be made at the next general Election. Why should Nations meet with hostile Eyes, because Villains & Ideots have acted like Villains & Ideots? I wish for peace ardently; but must say, delightful as it is, it will come more grateful by being unexpected. The first Act of Violence on the Part of Administration in America, or the Attempt to reinforce General Gage this Winter or next Year, will put the whole Continent in arms from Nova Scotia to Georgia. May God of his infinite Mercy grant a happy Event to these af flicting Agitations. [P.S.] It is suspected here, that a Design is regularly prosecuted by the Ministry, to make his Majesty dethrone himself, by the Calamities & Convulsions his Reign is likely to bring on his whole People.

205,dg001216,1774,John Dickinson to Josiah Quincy Jr,"""John Dickinson to Josiah Quincy, Jr.   My dear Sir, Fairhill Octr. 28th 1774 I should have answer'd your last Letter before You left Boston, if I had not imagined from what You said in it, that You must have sail'd before it could have reach'd that Place. I now congratulate You on the hearty Union of all America from Nova Scotia to Georgia in the Common Cause. The particulars, You are, no Doubt, acquainted with. The Congress broke up the Day before Yesterday; and if it be possible, the Return of the Members into their several Countries, will make the People still more firm. The most peaceable Provinces, are now animated; and a Civil War is un- avoidable, unless there be a quick Change of British Measures. The usual Events, no Question, will take place, if that happens--Victories & Defeats. But what will be the final Consequence? If she fails, immediate Distress, if not Ruin. If she conquers, Destruction at last. But from the best Judgement I can form, she will not wait long for her Fate. Several European Powers, it is probable, will fall on, as soon as she is entangled with Us. If they should not, what can she effect at 3000 Miles Distance against at least four hundred Thousand Freemen, fighting \""pro aris & Focis.\"" I cannot but pity a brave & generous Nation thus plung'd in Misfortunes by a few worthless persons. But, it may be said, how can she retract with Dignity, in the present Position of Affairs? I answer, her Dignity is not at all concern'd, unless it be, to punish those who have abused & betrayed her into Measures inconsistent with her Welfare. Is a Nation bound in Honor to support every mad or villain nous Step of a Ministry? It is mean to persist in Errors because We have committed them; but what is to be said of those, who talk of as serting their own dignity, by vindicating the Errors of others? The present Cause, is that of Bute, Mansfield, North, Bernard, Hutchincon &c not of Great Britain. Let her renounce their detestable projects, which point at her as their ultimate Object, and reconcile herself to her Children, while their Minds are capable of Reconciliation. \""Oh! for a warning Voice,\"" to rouse them to Conviction of this important Truth--that the Reconciliation depends upon the passing Moments--& that the Opportunity will in a short time be as irrevocably past as the Days beyond the Flood. Every Thing may yet be attributed to the Misrepresentations & Mistakes of Ministers; and universal Peace be establish'd throughout the British World, only by a general Acknowledgment of this Truth, that--half a dozen Men are Fools or Knaves. If their Character for Ability & Integrity is to be maintain'd by wrecking the whole Empire, Monsr. Voltaire may write an addition to the Chapter on the Subject of little Things producing great Events, that will be very entertaining to Readers. OCTOBER 28, 1774  As to your Complaint against an Expression in a late Letter, know, Dear Sir, I wrote in Agonies of Mind for my Brethren in Boston.(1) I trembled, least something might have happened, which I could not only forgive but applaud, but which might have been eagerly & basely seiz'd by others, as a Pretence for deserting them. This was the sense of Men in Philadelphia the most devoted to them. And under this Apprehension, We agreed to make use of the strongest Expressions. May the Father of Mercies bestow every Blessing upon You, is the fervent Prayer of, my dear Sir, your faithful & affectionate Friend John Dickinson ""

206,dg001217,1774,Edward Rutledge to Ralph Izard,"""Edward Rutledge to Ralph Izard   My Dear Sir: Chester, October 29, 1774 A moment's leisure gives me an opportunity of communicating to you the business we have transacted, which is briefly this. We have formed a bill of Rights, by which we insist, that no power on earth has a right to intermeddle with our internal polity; but that the Parliament of Great Britain, has, of necessity, a right to regulate trade. We have framed a list of grievances, and have formed an association, not to import any goods, &c., either from Great Britain or Ireland, until such grievances, as have arisen since the year '63, and are enumerated in such association, shall be redressed. We have further resolved, that, \""if a repeal of those laws, by which we are oppressed, does not take place, anterior to the 10th of September next, we will not export any commodity to Great Britain, Ireland or the West Indies, except rice to Europe.\""(1) It will take more wisdom than I am master of, to reconcile this plan to reason; for, upon the most mature deliberation, I disapprove of it. I have repeatedly held forth my testimony against it, as inexpedient and weak. I do not mean the bill of Rights; that I think well of, and offered it every support in my power: for I hold it as a clear truth, that they have no right to interfere in the regulation of our in OCTOBER 29, 1774  ternal polity, where we have a power within ourselves that is equal to the exigencies of our affairs; it being as ridiculous to suppose that there could be two complete legislatures, as that there should be two superior beings. But no good reason can be urged why we should be satisfied with a restoration of such rights only, as have been violated since the year '63, when we have as many others, as clear and indisputable, that will even then be infringed. Nor can any sufficient reason be assigned, why a non exportation should not be put on foot immediately, or a non-importation delayed, until we are ripe for a non-exportation, as, I suppose, that the more interested the people of Great Britain are in the colonies, the more property they have with us, the more desirous and industrious will they be to obtain a repeal of the oppressive acts. But I was very desirous that both of them should take place at an early day, and think a few months would have put everything to rights again. But to make the matter more absurd, we have come into a resolution not to export indigo. This, I was totally against. I proposed to stop all exportation--nothing short of that would satisfy me. I saw no reason why the inhabitants of this, and the neighboring colonies, should have full liberty to export their wheat and flour to every part of Europe, and that we should be restricted so much in our trade; for under the statute of Charles II., we could not carry rice to any part of the world, except to England and Scotland. It is true that, by some subsequent acts, we had liberty to carry it to other parts, but these were only temporary satutes; and the one which permits it to be carried to the south of Cape Finisterre, will expire with the present session of Parliament. Their commodities, not being enumerated, may be carried to any part of the globe. It was said, if they were in an advantageous situation, why not allowed the use of it? The answer is ready: because equality is the ba sis of public virtue. People who are affected but in speculation, and submit to all the hardships attending it, will not shut up their ports, while their neighbors, who are the objects of ministerial vengeance, enjoy, in a great degree, the benefits of commerce. Nor is the fact true, that Great Britain will not be distressed by withholding our trade to other parts of the world, for the wealth which is acquired by such trade, must go to our enemies. But to stop the exportation of indigo, is still more foolish; it is unequal, too, between the different parts of the province. St. Helena, is not well affected; the Georgians are disaffected. How easy will it be for the people, in that part of the province, to carry their commodity to that market. Again: if they give up the planting of indigo, what can they do? They can plant nothing else but provisions, which they can never dispose of, as the West India trade will be at an end.  But why stop; does it pay duty? No. It receives a bounty; it is useful, they say, in dying. Cannot these things be procured from the French? Yes. But if they could not, why shall we distress our own people, for no other purpose, than to oblige the people of England to weave white cloth, instead of blue? I had much more to say, but have not time. However, this I must add, that, if the acts are not repealed before May, at which time we are to have a new Congress, we shall certainly go much farther: for, submission never can, nor ever shall take place. Remember me to Mrs. Izard. I am just this moment setting out for Carolina. God bless you.

211,dg001223,1774,County Freeholders,"""County Freeholders   Gentlemen, New York 7th November 1774. When our common Liberties are invaded, our dearest Rights in Danger, and a whole Continent loudly called upon to defend and secure themselves against high handed Oppression: the Confidence resposed in us as Delegates of your respectable County is a distinguished Honour, which excites our most affectionate Esteem and demands our most grateful Acknowledgments. While we lament that our Talents are unequal to the most important Trust that ever was conferred, we have the Consolation to assure you that we have endeavoured to discharge the arduous Task NOVEMBER 7, 1774  with Zeal and Fidelity, with a fervent Regard to the Interest and Happiness of our Country: and a respectful Attention to what we conceived to be the Sentiments of our numerous Constitutents. It is with the greatest Satisfaction we reflect that while this Colony has been eminently conspicuous for Loyalty, for their Veneration for the parent State, and for the Support of just Government, it has never failed to exhibit the most solid Proofs of an inviolable Attachment to Constitutional Liberty: From repeated Testimonies of the Fortitude and patriotism of our Countrymen it is not to be questioned but that they will in this perilous Hour, when their Virtue and public Spirit are called forth to a glorious Trial, stand firm to their Engagements, and with unremitting Ardour and inflexible Integrity maintain the Association entered into by their Representatives. You Gentlemen in particular who have so chearfully and unanimously embraced the Expedient of a Continental Congress and appealed to them for the Redress of your Grievances and the preserva- tion of your Rights, will, we are confident, nobly disdain every sordid Advantage and temporary Convenience incompatible with a plan suggested by their united Councils. You will not hesitate to prefer to every other Consideration, the great purposes of rescuing Americans from the Chains of Despotism, and handing down to your posterity the inestimable Blessings which are only to be enjoyed in a free Gov ernment established on the Basis of Constitutional Liberty. It is our cordial Advice and most earnest Wish that our worthy Constituents of every Rank and Degree may zealously inculcate that Union and Harmony which can alone render tolerable the progress, and ensure the Success of this unhappy and much lamented Conflict with our parent State: A Conflict justified by the principles of self preservation and into which we are innocently plunged by the artful Wiles of an infatuated and tyrannical Ministry! Let us remember that Discord and Faction cannot fail of exposing us to the Contempt of our Enemies and the Reproaches of our Friends: that by overwhelming us in Anarchy and Confusion they must enfeeble and disappoint the best concerted Measures and that Nothing but a Spirit of Benevolence, mutual Forbearance and Liberality to the distressed, can soften the Calamities of this tempestuous Season and maintain that internal Tranquility which is at all Times desireable, but absolutely indispensible in this great Struggle for Freedom. Unable sooner to present you in one View with the Acts of Congress, it is with Regret that we have thus long been obliged to withold this mark of Respect, which we owe to our worthy Constitu- tents. The Copy inclosed (1) comprizes every proceeding except the petition to the King which cannot in point of Decorum be made pub lick until it has been laid before the Throne. The several Resolutions are too clear and explicite to require Illustration, you will therefore  be pleased to be refered to them for the Measures it is expected you will at this momentuous period adopt and religiously observe. Permit us only to add that the Recommendation of the Committee of Correspondence of this City in Favour of the distressed Inhabitants of the Town of Boston has received additional weight by one of the Resolutions of the Congress. Every Motive of Duty Humanity and Policy requires that we should at such a Juncture contribute to the Relief of a people suffering in a common Cause as the devoted Victims of Ministerial Vengeance; and we flatter ourselves that you will not be backward in setting an Example on this Occasion worthy of Imitation and Applause. We have the Honour to be with the greatest Esteem Gentlemen Your most obliged and most obedient humble Servants.(2) Phil. Livingston Isaac Low John Alsop Jas. Duane John Jay ""

212,dg001224,1774,Silas Deane to Samuel Adams,"""Silas Deane to Samuel Adams   Dear Sir Wethersfeild Novemr. 13th. 1774 I congratulate You on Your safe return and agreeable reception at Boston; but more particularly on the Acct. from Montreal which You doubtless have seen in Holts paper of last Week,(1) this seems like an Omen for good, that while we were preparing our address to the Inhabitants of Quebeck, They Themselves were taking stepps to pursue measures for releif but sir have We not been short in Two or three Articles at the Congress. You may remember I hinted at an Address to the inhabitants of the West Indies, & of Ireland, then and the oftener I have thought of it since the more I am confirmed in opinion of the propriety & expediency of such a measure, but it is now Too late, but the following is not, (Viz) To have the whole doings of the Congress, translated into the French, & German Languages You know there is an ostensible Reason, and a good one for NOVEMBER 13, 1774  it--To oblige the French in Canada, & the Germans in Pennsylvania &c. But at the same Time there may be another unnecessary to be publicly mentioned--The effects the Circulating of this Pamphlet in France, & Holland may have, on the Affairs of Great Brittain & on her Connections with those States, especially with her Creditors in the Latter. The sale of the impression would I am perswaded bear the expence of the translation &c. If You think this thought, worth pursuing, a Line to Philadelphia will effect it at once. The people in this Colony You know will pay the most sacred regard To the resolutions of the Congress but I cannot help expressing my apprehensions that the distresses of the people in Boston may increase faster than the supplies from the Country. The hand of Charity soon grows cold, and Too many call that Charity, which is nothing more, than a small part of an immense Debt they justly owe You, for suffering in their Cause. If my apprehensions are groundless You will forgive them on Account of the Cause, from whence they rise, but if otherways, I wish a more particular State of your Situation of Your past, & present sufferings was drawn up and circulated as well to silence those who endeavor to lessen them, in order to prevent, as farr as possible, any thing being done for You, as to stirr up those really well disposed, but too inattentive, to Your situation. Surely it will be false Modesty, to decline even asking, for what the Continent have Unanimously declared Your due. In any thing of this kind, in particular, as well as what more generally affects the great & Common Cause, You know You can command Me, to the utmost of my Narrow Abilities. The object before You, The Town of Boston must naturally engage all Your attention, otherways I would ask, and expect an Answer, whither Your people have any Thoughts of a Western extension. This Claim pursued in the only effectual Way, which is by actual Settlement, would effectually defeat the Quebec Bill, and open perhaps to Us, certainly to Our Posterity, in those fruitful Regions more peaceable retreats, than those We are Now contending for, as Men of Warr, and Armies cannot easily or perhaps possibly penetrate thither. Our People are increasing that Way fast, Two, or Three Thousand strong in fighting Men there already, & may in a few Years extend as farr as Lake Erie east End, which will open a most extensive Scene, & that not to very distant Years or Ages, but even in Our Days. But more immediately pressing Scenes demand Our present Attention, yet This, with Me, is one that ought not to be wholly Neglected. I have rambled beyond my intention but it may divert You, therefore make no Apology, but am With Complim[en] ts to Mr. Cushing, Mr. Jno. Adams, & Mr. Payne, Dear sir, Your most Obedt. & Very Hume. servt Silas Deane P.S. Having a Moments Leisure, I threw on paper, the outlines of a plan, drawn up sometime since, which is not Now before Me.  E N C L OS U R E Loose Thoughts on the Subject of the Western Lands Fort Detroit, situated between Lake Erie, and Lake Huron is in the same Latitude with Boston, this leads Me to conclude that the dividing Line between the province of Massachusetts Bay, and Con- necticut will run through the Lake Erie leaving about one third of it in Connecticut. Travellers give a most extraordinary Acct. of the Lands on the Banks of that Lake, & on the Rivers running into it. The pass of Niagara is very much the Key to the Western Lakes if You consider the passage that way as going through the lake Ontario, but the purchase which the Connecticut people have made of the Natives begins on the Western bank of the Delaware and extends West One Hundred & Twenty Miles the width of the Colony. Consequently, it will nearly reach, the South East Corner, of That Lake which is said to be a very fine situation, it certainly must be as good a Stand, as any in America, for the Waters of this Lake, or Streams communicating with it afford Water Carriage, except about Ten Miles by the Falis & rapids quite to Quebec Northward, & with about the same Land Carriage You get into the Waters of the Ohio Southward, and Westward as farr as Travellers have explored, which is more than One Thousand Miles. It is proposed in the Spring as soon as Travelling is any way tolerable, to explore Westward from where Our People are settled, the Country, as farr as to This Lake, and if practicable make a purchase of the Natives, of a Tract of Land, sufficient for a Large Settlement on the Shores Thereof. The purchase of the Natives may be easily effected, and as to having Liberty of the Superintendant, it will hereafter be of no Consequence at all, nor indeed do I consider it of any at present, as it may very easily be made appear that The [foretended?] Treaties & Negotiation, of the late Sir William Johnson with these Tribes was never any thing more than a Covering for an iniquitous, & lucrative traffic in which the Natives, and the Crown, were both of them deluded, & plundered. The Natives never had on their part, the most distant Idea, that the Crown of Great Brittain ever assumed a right, to controll them, in the disposal of their property. They are too free, & too jealous a people not To take the alarm, at the least pretensions of this Nature. The presents they annually received, were to Them, &c still are, direct proofs To the Contrary, for how could they conceive that the Crown should pay a Subsidy to them for past, & in earnest for future services, and at the same Time exert the last degree of absolute sovereignty over them. But waving this, as quite one side, the immediate object, it is proposed, that on such purchase being made, a Number of Settlers, at least one Thousand strong should instantly  move on to the Land, with every Necessary, for carrying on, and supporting their plantation. Such a Body will be sufficient to Awe the Natives, in case, they are Uneasy, and as to the Government of Quebec, or the Crown of Great Brittain, They will be too remote, to occasion much Difficulty from them, and as to the Natives, it must ever be, the invariable policy, of the Settlers, to Treat Them with such humanity, and hospitality, that it shall be their Interest To be Friendly. It is proposed that One Thousand persons join in this Adventure at first, each of Which, shall advance Twenty shilling, toward defraying the Expences of the adventure. This sum shall be laid out in Goods proper for the Indian Trade & committed to the Care, of Three trusty, able persons to Transport thither in the best manner, & to lay out, in a purchase of the Natives if to be obtained, if Not, the effects, their expences deducted, to be returned to the Subscribers, but the purchase made, each subscriber shall be obliged to send one able bodied Man to settle thereon within One year after or forfeit his Right. The purchase shall if practicable be made half within the Massachusetts & half within the Connecticut Grants, but the Adventurers shall not consider themselves within either, further than meerly for ostensible purposes but they shall form a Government of their Own, as nearly as local Circumstances will admit, similar, to the first Confederations or Common Wealths in these New England Colonies. The Contiual accession to this Settlement will soon render it important, even, if No extraordinary pains are taken, to transport Inhabitants thither. But will it not be the very best policy to open Our Doors wide, and use every means, in Our power, to invite the poor, industrious Inhabitants of Scotland, Ireland &c to come in and join Us, and with but little incouragement they will flock over in Numbers, and soon render it important. This, or some such plan, will most effectually defeat the design of the Quebec Bill, which if not broke thro' & defeated in some shape or other, will be the most fatally mischeivous to the British Colonies of any Bill ever framed by the Ministry, or that may possibly ever enter into their Hearts To conceive of. The extending & fixing Settle ments of protestants Westward will not only bring about this wish'd for event, but will be in future Days Our greatest Strength & Security. Another Tier as I may say of Colonies settled back of Us will be, an inexhaustible resource to Us, &c render Us humanely speaking in vincible though the united Powers of the whole World should attack Us. Look at a Map, & see, the situation of the Countries between 40.° & 45.° through the Continent. This is the New England Inheritance, as fairly secured for them, by their Ancestors, as any one Acre they Now possess, and once well settled with Our People, & their descendants, will give Law, not to North & South America alone, but to the World if they please. This will, & must be the most indepen-  dant Country on the Globe, inland Seas or Lakes, and Rivers ex tending quite across the Continent in those parallels, and the Western extremity lands Us at the very Door, of the Treasures of the East, and The South. If the Contemplation of these future events give Us pleasure every effort of Ours to ripen them if successful, in degree realizes them. This can hardly be called the pleasure of the imagination only, but rather the pleasure of anticipating great, & important realities, & such as are hastening on, & in the arrival of which, the happiness of Mankind is most deeply interested.

213,dg001225,1774,William Hooper to James Duane,"""William Hooper to James Duane   My dear Sir Philadelphia Nov. 22. 1774 After a cold disagreeable Journey I arrived here on Saturday evening last. I cannot leave this place without expressing my gratitude for the many Civilities I received from yourself &c your Friends in New York. It will give me the greatest pleasure to have it in my power hereafter in Carolina or elsewhere to be useful to you or them. I find no material change in the political System of Philadelphia since I left it. The same patriotick fervor still kindles in the breasts of the Inhabitants and urges them to a strict adherence to the measures which the Grand Continental Congress has taught them are to produce the salvation of themselves & their posterity in time, and such is the faith of some of these political patients that they are willing to extend the blessed Influence to all Eternity. God bless the Congress Surely they were inspired! I have surprized every person with whom I have conversed with the candid representation I have made of the political Creed of the New Yorkers and their firm and steady resolution strictly to adhere to the proceedings of the Congress. They view it as a kind of Change which required the immediate and almighty interposition to effect-they call it miraculous & begin to augur favourably of the cause in which they are embarked from Heaven having thus signally discovered its approbation of it in the conversion & reformation which it has thus worked in your Countrymen. Strange that you have been so flagrantly misrepresented. I am perfectly sincere when I say that NOVEMBER 22, 1774  your Province has been cruelly misrepresented--but it is a Consolation to you that it has been by a set of men who would have treated a second Saviour in the same manner if he had encountered the li- centiousness of their Religion as their politicks. I have been informed since I came here that the Pamphlet enti- tled, The friendly address to the Americans &c has thro a mistaken zeal of the people been prevented from being publickly sold in this City;(1) Strange Infatuation that while we contend with enthusiastick ardor for the liberty of the press ourselves that we should with such an intolerating spirit deny it to others. It is a strange freedom that is confined to one side of a Question! Doctrines in politicks that will not bear a freedom of discussion carry with them more than a suspicion of being erroneous, and I am confident that the world will not be so easily gulled in these as in the unquestionable mysteries of Church faith. They will take the freedom to think for themselves, & even to condemn what will not upon a fair dispassionate enquiry stand the test of solid reason & sound Criticism. I do not mean to insinuate that the Pamphlet referred to has merit. I think it the most trifling performance that the publick have yet been insulted with. The Author has wrote to the passions--to inflame & mislead weak minds. He has conjured up the Horrors of a Civil War to affright the timid. It will at once discover the disingenuity of the Author when We find him asserting that the American contention is as to the Quantum of the Taxation not the mode of imposing it. Be that as it will, Neglect would be his greatest punishment. Let him speak in obscurity, Persecution is what he covets. This poor son of the Church is aiming at promotion & he knows the dirty Channels thro which in the present administration it flows. It argues a weak mind to contend with a clergyman, it is a squabble with the other Sex. Genl Lee has prepared an answer to it which you will soon see.(2) He is on the wing for Maryland whither He is invited to observe the military maneuvers of 500 Militia lately incorporated there. They have destroyed a Cargo of Tea in So. Carolina. We leave this on Thursday. In Carolina I flatter myself I shall hear from you.

There are many Names in your List of Committee Men, which I had not the Pleasure of knowing, but there are Abilities, Virtues, and Spirit enough, in those whom I knew very well, to secure the good Behaviour, of any Committee which could I think be chosen in Your & my beloved City. The Letter to Quebec, Shall be faithfully & Speedily forwarded. Our Provincial Congress, and the Committee of Correspondence in Boston, have had under Consideration, various Planns, for opening a Communication, with Several Parts of that Province. You kindly inquire What We are doing or Suffering? You will See, by a Printed Pamphlet, which I will Send you as soon as it is out, what our Provincial Congress, has been doing. I.e. you will see in Part; not all. Our People, thro the Province, are every where learning the military Art--exercising perpetually--So that, I Suppose, if occasion should require, an Army of, Fifteen Thousand Men from this Province alone, might be brought into the Field in one Week. The Difficulties We Suffer, however for want of Law and Government, are innumerable. A total Stagnation of Law, & Commerce almost. No Man can pay his just Debt, because he can get no Business to do, by which he can earn any Money, and if he has ever So much due to him he cant get a Shilling of it from his Debtors. We are trying by a Thousand Experiments, the Ingenuity as well as Virtue of our People. The Effects are Such as would divert you. Imagine, 400,000 People, without Government, or Law, forming themselves in Companies, for various Purposes, of Justice, Policy, & War. You must allow for a great deal of the ridiculous, much of the Melancholly, and Some of the Marvellous. I must not be particular, because my Letter, may miscarry. I have some Times wished, Since my Return, that We had fallen in, totis Viribus, with the Motion, made by Mr Ross and Seconded by Mr Galloway, that this Province Should be left to her own Discretion, with Respect to Government and Justice, as well as Defence.(2)Our Provincial Congress had in Contemplation, Some Sublime Con DECEMBER 12, 1774  ceptions, which would in that Case have been carried rapidly into Execution. Your Account of the Generals intended Journey to Maryland gave me great Pleasure. I hope the whole Continent will, provide themselves, at this Time with Arms and Skill. No Country ought ever to be without Either. The intuitive, the holy, the decisive Spirit, mentioned in a late Phyladelphia Paper, cannot avoid recollecting at this Time, my Friend, that the Grecian Commonwealths, were the most heroic Confederacy, that ever existed. The politest, bravest, & wisest of Men. Their Sculptors, Painters, Architects, Poets, Physicians, Criticks, Historians, Phylosophers, orators, Warriors, and Statesmen, were the brightest ornaments of their whole Species, and Examples for Imitation to all succeeding Generations. The Period of their Glory, was from the Defeat of Xerxes to the Rise of Alexander. Let Us not be enslaved, my dear Friend Either by Xerxes, or Alexander. The Town of Boston, is like Zion in Distress--Seneca's Virtuous Man, Struggling with Adversity. Spectaculum dignum ad quod respiciat Deus--Suffering amazing Loss, but determined to endure Poverty and Death, rather than betray America and Posterity. Be pleased to present my most respectfull Compliments and gratefull Acknowledgements, to Mr Dickinson, Thompson &c &c &c I have not Time to name them all--I mean almost the whole City of Philadelphia. I should have written to you, long before this, If I had not been prevented by an Inflammation in my Eyes, So violent that I have not been able to write, or read. Pray, write me, as often as possible, and let me know, how, the fourth Resolution in our Bill of Rights, is relished and digested, among the Choice Spirits along the Continent. I had more Anxiety about that than all the rest. But I find it is extreamly popular here. Our Provincial Congress have approved and adopted it, in Strong Terms. They consider it, as a great Point gained. They think it has placed our Connection with G. B. on its true Principles, and that there is no danger from it to Us, and there is quite as much allowed to her, as Either Justice or Policy require. ""

This Step from which [. . .] no certain Conclusion can be drawn of the Intention of Government with respect to America is differently spoke of according to the parties Men are engaged in, their [fears?] &c.

From all the latest Letters I have heard of, the Tide of popular Opinion is changing in favor of America, but I am afraid Governmt. will not be wise enough to remove intirely the Grounds of Jeolesy and Contention, but like Quacks in Politicks endeavour to still the present Clamour by an Adoption of temporary Expedients. The Candidates for London &c. signed a Kind of Test by which they promise their Endeav[ou]rs to shorten parliamts., exclude placemen, repeal the Boston Acts, the Act for Trial in England of those who offend in America, and I think the Quebec Bill, and it is said the Test is running pretty generally through England. If so England may yet enjoy a healthy Constitution and America be restored to her Rights. I shall hope for a virtuous independt.

With this View I entered into Engagements, with several Gentlemen of the late Congress, to transmit to them every Thing of Importance, which occurr'd in this Colony: and in return, to receive All interesting Intelligence, from Their several Governments. And, I shall be vastly happy, in opening a Correspondence with You, in the same Manner. The Letter from Lord Dartmouth,(1) & the Copy of the Kings Order in Council (Copies of which are enclosed) were brought by the Scarborough, recieved by Express on Wednesday Evening last, and next DECEMBER 14, 1774  Morning laid before the Genl. Assembly. They immediately ordered Copies of them to be sent to Mr. Cushing to be communicated to the Provincial Congress They ordered the Cannon at our Fort, (which was not tenable) to be sent to Providence where it will be safe & ready for service, 200 bbls of Powder and a proportionate quantity of Lead & Flints & several Companies of Light Infantry, Fusiliers, Hunters &c. were established, the Militia was ordered to be disciplined & the Commanding Officers impowerd to March our Troops to the Assistance of any Sister Colony. The Spirit and Ardor with which All this was done Gave Me the highest pleasure and I hope the Moment the other Colonies receive this intelligence they will proceed in the same spirited Manner. For this Ministry appear to be determined to Commence Hostilities against Us & Unless we are provided with Arms &c. We shall be an easy Prey to them, but if properly Arm'd and disciplined can certainly defend and secure our several Colonies. The Idea of taking up Arms against the parent State is shocking to Us, who still feel the strongest Attachment to our sovereign and the warmest Affection & Veneration for our Brethren in Britain. And may God in his infinite Mercy grant that We may never be driven to that fatal extremity but if We must either become Slaves or fly to Arms I shall not and I hope No American will hesitate one Moment which to chuse. For All the Horrors of a Civil War and even Death itself in any form whatever will be infinitely preferable to Slavery, which in one word comprehends Poverty Misery Infamy and every Species of Ruin & Distruction. I have inclosed You A Copy of the Resolves of our Genl. Assembly upon the report of their Delegates. The Polite Manner in which the other Gentn. of the Congress are mentioned I hope will be acceptable. The people are Universally satisfied with the proceedings of the Congress, and determined to Adhere to the Association, even the Merchants who suffer most by discontinuing the Slave Trade, Assure Me They shall most punctually conform to that Resolve and the Country in general is vastly pleased with it. The Other Copy contains the Appointment & Instructions of the new Delegates.(2) The power of Appointing Time & Place I thought Absolutely necessary, for the small Pox and many other Things may make it necessary to change both. The Power of Adjourning is equally necessary for a new Congress cannot be chosen under a considerable Time. Whilst this is doing the public may Suffer almost irreparable Injuries. An Adjournment may prevent any thing of this kind and be Attended with no inconveniences but a trifling Expence. Some Gentn. were of opinion that if our grievances were redressed Another Congress would be unnecessary but I am of a different opinion, many regulations of Commerce Manufactures &c may be made for the general good of the Colonies. And should the Ministry  be disposed to make any new Attempts upon Us Nothing would so effectually prevent their taking Place as our continuing firmly united & being ever on our Guard. For these Reasons I proposed an Annual Congress. Upon the whole Our Powers, I think, are very full And I heartily wish that those of all the other Delegates may be so. For the more Uniform and full the Powers of the several Delegates Are, the more Scope they will have for exerting their abilities in the Service of their Country. We may then debate with Freedom, resolve with Wisdom & Unanimity & execute with firmness whatever the Interest & happiness of our Country require. If any Amendments occur to You, be kind enough to favour Me with them & I doubt not but they will be readily Adopted. I am greived to tell You that the Distresses of those brave People of Boston increase. Many w ho have hitherto supported themselves are now forced to apply to the Public. May the Colonies Continue their generous Donations & may Heaven grant them a speedy Deliverance. Please to make my Compliments to the Speaker Mr. Biddle, Mr. Mifflin and the other Gentn. who were Delegates with Us, & to the Secy with my particular thanks for a Journal extraordinary, & present my most respectful regards to Your good Lady. I am with very great Esteem and Regard, Dear Sir Your most obedient humble Servant Sam Ward P.S. I have not had time to communicate this Intelligence to Mary land.

219,dg001231,1774,Samuel Ward to Richard Henry Lee,"""Samuel Ward to Richard Henry Lee   Dear Sir Westerly 14th Decr. 1774 As it is of the greatest Importance that every Colony should have the earliest Notice of the hostile Intentions of Administration I have enclosed You Copies of Lord Dartmouths Letter & the Order received with it.(1) Our Genl. Assembly immediately ordered Copies of them to be sent to Mr. Cushing to be communicated to the provincial Congress. They then ordered the Cannon at Fort George (which was not tenable) to be sent to Providence where they will be safe and ready for Service, 200 bbls. of Powder, a proportionate quantity of Lead & Flints & several Pieces of brass Cannon for the Artillery Compy. were order'd to be purchased, a Major (General (an officer never before chosen in the Colony) was appointed, several independent Companies of light Infantry Fusiliers, Hunters &c were formed, the Militia was order'd to be disciplined & the Commanding Officers empowered to march the Troops to the Assistance of any Sister Colony. The Spirit & Ardor with which all this was done gave Me ineffable Pleasure and I heartily wish that the other Colonies may proceed in the same spirited Manner for I fear the last Appeal to Heaven must now be made & if We are unprepared We must be undone. The Idea of taking up Arms against Great Britain is shocking but if We must become Slaves or fly to Arms I shall not hesitate one Moment which to chuse for all the Horrors of civil War & even Death itself in every Shape is infinitely prefarable to Slavery which in one Word comprehends every Species of Distress Misery Infamy & Ruin. I have enlosed the Resolve of our Assembly upon the Report of their Delegates. The polite Notice taken of all the Gentn. of the Congress I hope will be acceptable; You may rely upon a most punctual Adherence to the Association in this Colony. The other Copy contains the Appointment and Instructions of the new Delegates. The Power of appointing Time & Place for holding a Congress I thought absolutely necessary for the small Pox & many other Things may make it inconvenient to sett at Philadelphia. The Power of adjourning is equally necessary for it will take much Time to chuse new Members & in the interim the Public may suffer the greatest Mischiefs & the trifling Expence of Meeting is the only Objection. It was supposed by some Gentn. that if our Grievances were redressed this Winter there would be no Necessity of another Congress. I am of a different Opinion. Many new Regulations of Commerce Manufactures &c, may be adopted for the general Good of the Colonies and should the Ministry be inclined to make any new Attempts upon Us our being united & on our Guard would be the most probable Means of preventing them. For these Reasons I proposed an an- DECEMBER 14, 1774  Portrait of Samuel Ward DECEMBER 16, 1774  nual Congress; upon the whole our Powers are full & I wish all the Delegates may have such that being free from all Restraints We may deliberate with Freedom, resolve wisely & execute with Firmness whatever the Necessities of our Country may require. The Distresses of the Town of Boston increase greatly. Many who have till lately supported themselves are now forced to apply to the public, eighteen or twenty Petitions are sometimes recd. in a Day. May the generous Donations of the Colonies continue until God in Mercy relieves them. Be kind enough to present my most respectful Compliments to your worthy Collegues & to your good Lady & Family & ever remember Me as one who is With the greatest Esteem & Regard Dear Sir Your most obedient humble Servant Sam: Ward P.S.

Annapo. 16 Decr. 1774 My Time and Attention has been much taken up since I left you with my Business in my Profession and what I think less entertaining Meetings of the People Committees, Conventions, &c. I now inclose you the Proceedgs of the last,(1) and though I do not imagine the Resolutions of the Congress are agreeable to every Individual of our Province yet I believe all are so well convinced of the Necessity of Unanimity that we shall have no Trouble at all to execute the Association or by degrees to go any Length that may be necessary to defend the Rights of America. We shall probably have no Assembly till the Spring; that may not be the Case with all the Colonies and if a Congress is thought at Home to be unconstitutional or what is more likely the Ministry intend to treat with the several Assemblies seperately to avail themselves of a hoped for Disunion or Differences in the Claims of Right I imagine several Assemblies will be called especially in those Colonies where the People in general are the most strongly attached to the Mother Country. You and I, I believe, thought much alike and were equally distressed on particular Points but as Things are now circumstanced if the Proceedgs of the Congress come before the Assemblies I am afraid a Disapprobation of any Article might be of infinite Mischief to our Cause. I shall be glad of your Sentiments on this truly delicate point and if your Assembly should sit that you'd take the DECEMBER 16, 1774  Portrait of Thomas Johnson DECEMBER 28, 1774  Trouble to furnish me with your proceedg it may be a Matter of Consequence to be well advised of it.

221,dg001233,1774,John Adams to James Burgh,"""John Adams to James Burgh?   Sir Braintree Decr. 28. 1774. I have had the Honour of receiving from you a most (valuable) desirable Present, in two Volumes of Political Disquisitions.(1) The very polite and obliging manner in which this Present was conveyed to me demands my gratefull Acknowledgments. But the Present itself is invaluable. I cannot but think those Disquisitions, the best Service, that a Citizen, could render to his Country, at this great and dangerous Crisis, when the British Empire Seems ripe for destruction, and tottering on the Brink of a Precipice. If any Thing can possibly open the Eyes of the Nation and excite it to exert itself, it must be such a Sight of its Danger, and of the imperceptible Steps, by which it ascended to it. I have contributed somewhat to make the Disquisitions more known and attended to in several Parts of America, and they are held in as high Estimation by all my Friends as they are by me. And the more they are read the more eagerly and generally they are Sought for. We have pleased ourselves in America, with Hopes, that the Publication of these Disquisitions, the Exertions of the other Friends of Virtue and Freedom in England, together with the Union of Sentiment and Conduct of America, which appears by the Proceedings of the Congress of Phyladelphia, would have had their full operation and Effect upon the Nation, during the Fall and Winter, while the People were canvassing for Elections, and that in Spight of Bribery, Some alteration in the House of Commons for the better might have been made. But the Sudden Dissolution of Parliament and the impatient Summons for a new Election, have blasted all these Hopes. We now see plainly, that every Trick and Artifice of Sharpers, Gamblers DECEMBER 28, 1774  and Horse Jockies is to be played off against the Cause of Liberty in England and America: and that no Hopes are to be left for Either but in the Sword. We are in this Province Sir, at the Brink of a civil War. Our Alva, Gage, with his fifteen Mandamous Councillers, are Shutt up in Boston, afraid to Stir, afraid of their own Shades, protected with a Dozen Regiments of Regular Soldiers, and strong Fortifications, in the Town, but never moving out of it. We have No Council, No House, No Legislature, No Executive. Not a Court of Justice, has Sat Since the Month of September--Not a debt can be recovered, nor a Trespass redressed, nor a Criminal of any kind, brought to Punishment. What the Ministry will do next, is uncertain--inforce the Act for altering our Govt. [it] cannot. All the Regiments upon the Establishment, wd not do it--for Juries will not serve, nor Represent. Whatever Alva and his Troops may think of it, it has required great Caution and Delicacy in the Conduct of Affairs, to prevent their Destruction. For my own Part I have bent my chief Attention to prevent a Rupture, and to impress my Friends with the Importance of preventing it. Not that I think the Lives of 5 or 10 thousand Men, tho my own should be one of them, would not be very profitably Spent, in obtaining a Restoration of our Liberties. But because I know, that those Lives would never go unrevenged, and it would be vain ever to hope for a Reconcilation with great Britain afterwards. Britains would not easily forgive the Destruction of their Brethren. I am absolutely certain that New England men never would that of theirs. Nor would any Part of America ever forget or forgive, the destrucion of one New England man in this Cause. The Death of 4 or 5 Persons, the most obscure, and inconsiderable that could have been found upon the Continent, on the 5th March 1770 has never yet been forgiven by any Part of America. What then would be the Consequence of a Battle in which, many Thousands must fall of the best Blood, the best Families, Fortunes, Abilities and moral Characters in the Country? America, never will Submit to the Claims of Parliament and Administration. New England alone has 200,000 fighting Men. And all in a Militia, established by Law, not exact Soldiers, but all used to Arms.(2) ""

222,dg001234,1774,James Duane to Samuel Chase,"""James Duane to Samuel Chase   Dear Sir New Yorke 29t. Decembr 1774 I am greatly obliged to you for communicating so early the important Transactions of your provincial Congress. In the publick Letter from the New York Committee to your Committee of Correspondence you will see the Footing on which this delicate Business rests with Us. The Members of our Assembly live so dispersed that I am a Stranger to their (political Creed) Feelings at this alarming Crisis, and the Gentlemen of that House who are in Town seem either not to have formed decisive Sentiments or to act on the Reserve till they try the pulses of their Brethren. The time swiftly approaches when they must declare themselves & take a conclusive part and to you or our Friend Mr. Johnson I shall faithfully communicate the result of their deliberations. My Conjectures can give you no useful Information and I am sure they will be readily dispensed with. The Step you have taken which will be called an Assumption of the Militia into your own hands is certainly of a very serious nature and here it produces great Anxiety.(1) It is observed that it is the first publick Act out of the pale of New England which indicates a prepa- ration for war & denounces its near Approach; & Men make a wide distinction between the calm & deliberate Resolutions of Maryland remote from the Scene of Action, & the Conduct of those who more immediately engaged in it have their passions roused & their Appre- hensions stretched to a painful Pitch of Anxiety. You may be assured that the seizing & dismantling Fort William & Mary by the Inhabitants of New Hampshire & removing the Cannon & military Stores to an interior Town in that province occasions far less agitation than the Issue of your Convention.(2) My principal alarm is that those Measures will inflame the Ardor of our Friends in Boston and precipitate an Attack on the King's Troops. It is beyond all doubt with me that this is what is wished for by a vindictive Ministry. In that way they may hope to subdue us by the Strength of their Arms: whereas if we coud maintain a pacific and defensive Conduct Success must unquestionably crown our Efforts & reward our Fortitude. What have we to fear but the uncertain issue of War? The Ministry have in my opinion spent their malice in enacting that cruel project of Shutting up the port of Boston. But this brings them very little nearer to the Object they aim at than they were at first setting out. They have cut off its trade & greatly oppressed Individuals: but the province is still at Liberty to pursue its Commerce with the usual vigour and success. They have Blockaded the Harbour with a Fleet & filled the Town with Troops but the generous Contributions of the Colonies and the immense Sums diffused by so great an Armament will upon the whole rescue this devoted people from intolerable Distress.(3)Calami- DECEMBER 29, 1774  tous as is their situation it is in such Events to be preferred to the Horrors and the uncertain issue of a civil war. The other branches of ministerial Tyranny must fall of themselves. A new form of Government cannot be imposed without their own Consent. There can be no Court without Suitors & Jurors: no Legislature without the lower House. The Authors of this despotic plan may threaten, they may re double their Fleets & Armies & call those of Russia &c, at which I shoud not be surprized, to their Assistance, but unless we begin the attack or give them Reasons which will satisfy the world; in declaring us to be in Rebelion they will not, they dare not shed one drop of American blood. In the mean time can the people of England suffer patiently the Loss of their trade & all this accumulated Expence? Will they not when they feel clamour for a change of Measures? They will Let us but act with wisdom and Temper, avoid the Imputation of commencing hostilities & persevere with Virtue and Fortitude in our Association and all will yet be well without recurring to the last Extremity in which Victory itself however decided must be destructive. I think you may rely that the Inhabitants of this province will adhere to the Association with inflexible Integrity. That they will give it all the Time & opportunity to operate that can be desired; & if pacific Measures finally prove ineffecutal that they never will surrender up their Liberties. At the same time as far as my Information extends they are universally of your opinion that the Right of regulating our Trade bona fide, as the Basis of an accommodation ought to be ceded in the most express terms. The Maryland Arguments in which you had so great a share on this essential point were unanswerable. They were never attempted to be answered: yet unhappily they produced no Conviction. Tell me then my dear Sir how a plan of Union is to be adopted which will be acceptable in every Colony? You have not I see altered your Opinion; If the Question comes to be proposed to you in your Legislative Capacity do you think you will? If not is it reasonable to expect that this Colony will at once recede from what they have always laid down as a fundamental Principle of their Constitution. For my part I candidly confess that had this cardinal point been properly ascertained on a great occasion I shoud have been much more happy than I am at present. Finding it would not be yielded in any Terms which could give Satisfaction or even elude Suspicion, I listend to a certain plan (4) which chiefly on that Account made a deep Impression. I have not yet been fortunate enough to hear any objections against it which weigh in my Judgment. I ask the favour of you who were averse to it, & will not determine but on good Grounds to state them. In the mean time suffer me to explain the Light in which it strikes me. The plan is calculated to secure to every Colony its own exclusive internal Legislation & form of Gov  ernment; Except in matters which respect Great Britain & the Colonies jointly, such for instance as War &c Commerce. The new Council were to have no authority; and in all cases the Representatives of the people were to be vested with a complete negative. Thus far we shoud secure the first & capital Right of all free subjects; to be bound by no Laws without their prior Consent. But why it is said ought the parliament of England to participate in this great Council? I conceive for two Reasons, first that there may be but one supreme head in the State to conduct Events which regard the whole Empire & upon which its very Existence may depend, secondly because it is just that Great Britain shoud be guarded against all attempts of the Sovereign to unite with one part of the Empire, which must seem to [be] the most important, to oppress or injure her. It has been objected that this Plan by introducing these additional Assemblies is repugnant to the Constitution. I answer that Colonization is a new Case unprovided for by the Constitution: & it is therefore necessary to remedy the Defect by a new system founded on general principles of Liberty. It is further objectd that it is highly dangerous & by giving [. . .] (5) may be exposed to corruption; to this it is answered that our Assemblies at present [. ] (6) prove that there can be no Society without Confidence & that the direction of the Council may be so contrived as effectually to silence the Fears of seduction. You are already master of my sentiments on this plan & I may express my Thoughts with Freedom but I woud not have you to understand that I think it perfect in its present rude form & much less that I am so fond of it as to recommend it to our Assembly for Adoption. This however I must observe that if the right of regulating Trade is to be rejected or pared away to nothing some Plan of Union must be seriously thought of. That our different Assemblies will be called upon by Government for their respective Systems, I make no question: any more than I doubt that delegates even from our Congress woud have been respectfully receivd by Government if they would have suggestd any fit & reasonable Scheme for terminating our unhappy Dissentions amicably. I entreat you my dear Sir and the other delegates appointed for your Colony to take this Subject into serious Consideration. If you cannot approve of something like the above mentioned plan devise one which you will support. Think in Time of the Conditions of Union to which you will accede; & communicate them with Candour. This may be of the most important consequence to this Colony & to the Common Cause. We are among those that are thought most strongly attached to the parent State; & probably from us will first be demanded a System of Union. We therefore stand in need of Information; at least we ought to know the Sentiments of some of the Colonies, and I exclusively have my Eye upon those whose politics I think the most consistent & rational. I am afraid I have tired you  with this long disquisition but remember that you have twice pressed me to communicate my thoughts with Freedom, and I am encouraged from a Sense of duty as well as the Expectation of a rich exchange by expecting from you the same fraternal Candour. I am with great Esteem Dear Sir Your most Obedient Humble Servant Jas. Duane ""

223,dg001235,1774,James Duane to Thomas Johnson,"""James Duane to Thomas Johnson   My dear Sir New York 29th Decemr 1774 I have Just finished a long Letter to Mr Chase in Answer to one with which he was pleased to honour me. To avoid Repetition I have requested him to submit it to your Perusal. Addicted like you to a close Attention to the Duties of my profession I have ever avoided both from the want of Inclination & Leisure an active part in politics. Unhappily for my Repose the alarming state of our publick affairs & the Acts of my Countrymen oblige me at once to plunge into the midst of a Tempest which I find myself unable to direct. For the Association I am under no Concern the universal Acquiescence of the people having exceeded my most sanguine Expectation. But the approaching Session of our General assembly gives me the most painful Solicitude. The Necessity of maintaining an Union of Sentiment & Conduct with our Sister Colonies on the one hand & on the other the DECEMBER 29, 1774  dread of a civil War which I fear they will think sufficient Care has not been taken to prevent most powerfully operate on their Minds & distract their Councils. I tremble for the Event. If they pursue a Middle path, assume a Resolution to maintain their Rights with Fortitude and at the same time hold up a plan of Accommodation & Union, they must tread upon Thorns, expose themselves to Suspicion & Distrust & perhaps yield up points which their Sister Colonies will not approve. It is a great Misfortune that altho' I have carefully watchd the Temper of the Congress I am myself yet to learn what System will content a Majority of the Colonies; & conscientously Declare I can give them no New precise Information. It seems it was not a Subject fit to be determin'd by the united Councils of the Colonies & yet as you Justly remark every Colony will too probably be acted upon distinctly, & reduced to the necessity of declaring the Conditions on which they will accede to an Union & close this unnatural Breach which threatens the Empire with a Dissolution. The people here however misrepresented are sincerely devoted to the Cause of Liberty. And tho' they are ungenerously condemned in other colonies [. . .] they will not suffer the press to be restraind, nor a decent Freedom of speech to be controled. These Indulgences in part proceed from a proper sense of Liberty. Under this advantage It is not difficult for a Man of Observation to discern the General Opinion on important & popular subjects. It seems to be agreed here that every pacific & persuasive Expedient ought to be tried before a Recourse to Arms can be Justified; and accordingly the petition to the King as well as the Association are highly approved. Here they conclude we ought to rest till Time is given for the Operation of these Solitary Measures on the Success of which they greatly rely. If we proceed to Extremities the principal Burthen of a War they think will fall upon New England without any effectual Succor from their Neighbours & they cannot be persuaded that undisciplind & destitute of competent Artilery Ammunition, or Authority to enforce the Acts of War or [the Means] of defence these Colonies will long be able to maintain a Conflict with the formidable power of Great Britain. And if they shoud be subdued all is lost, & for an Age we must submit to the imperious Dictates of our Conquerors. They at the same time consider our Eastern Neighbours as highly irritated, impatient under severe and unmerited Sufferings, and so ready to rush into war that they are constrain'd by no other Consid- eration than a Respect to the advice of their Sister Colonies. The En- terprize of our New Hampshire Friends against Fort William & Mary; the Seizure of the Cannon & Ammunition, and their removal into an interior Town, which some Construe to be repugnant to the Spirit of that Resolution of the Congress which restrains the Massachusetts from offering Violence to the King's property, they conceive  to be a strong Indication of the Impetuosity of our Eastern Brethren. They therefore conclude it to be impolitic to inflame their Ardour or stimulate them to Action by military preparations in other Colonies. Besides it is apprehended that if such preparations shoud become general it will afford the ministry an opportunity of representing us as in a State of actual Hostility and of inciting against Us the passions, prejudice & the Vengence & Resentmt of the whole nation, frustrating all our moderate Councils, and extinguishing every Hope of Accommodation. These seem to be the prevailing Sentiments of a people who have engaged in this Contest with unusual Calmness & Deliberation, and who [. . .] it in all its Stages with a fixd & pensive Attention. And under such Impressions you will naturally imagine that they will enter into Measures which may be ascribed to a hostile and unconciliating Spirit with Caution and Reluctance. But notwithstanding all I have said you may rest fully assured that the most tremendous prospect will never intimidate them into mean Submissions or an unworthy Surrender of an Atom of their Liberties; however great their Attachment to England & Monarchy, & their desire of peace & Tranquillity. I have endeavored to give you a proof of my Candour and sincere Intention to encourage that friendly Correspondence which at so important a period may be of some Use to the Cause of our Country. The proceedings of our General Assembly shall be faithfully communicated with every Occurrence which may serve to explain the Temper & Views of a Colony whose Situation is upon many Accounts truly critical. I expect the same Friendship on your part & shall study to deserve it. Be pleased to accept my Thanks for your obliging favour accompanying the Resolves of your provincial Congress & believe me to be with very great Regard Dear Sir Your most obedient hum Servt J. D. ""

224,dg001236,1774,Joseph Galloway to Samuel Verplanck,"""Joseph Galloway to Samuel Verplanck?   Dear Sir. Trevois Decembr. 30th 1774 Your obliging Favor of the 17th Instant waited here, untill my Return from the Assembly; I shoud have answerd it sooner had not some particular Engagements which I coud not well postpone, prevented. You request that I wou'd give you my \""Sentiments occasionally on the State of our Public Affairs.\"" (1) Did you consider either the Danger or the Difficulty of the Task? You did not. The Land you live in, DECEMBER 30, 1774  where the Times so well described by Tacitus--\""when you may think what you please, and speak what you think,\"" prevail, affords no Ground for the Suspicion. But here, I often mourn to see that Country which ever since its Settlement has been deemed the first in the World for virtuous Liberty; where Agriculture, elegant and beneficial Improvements, Philosophy, and all the liberal Arts and Sciences have been nursed and ripen'd to a Degree of Perfection astonishing to Mankind; where Wisdom and sound Policy droping from the Lips of venerable Sages have ever sustaind their due Authority, kept the li- centious in Awe, & even renderd them Subservient to their own & the Public Welfare; and where Freedom, Peace and Order have always equally triumphed over those Enemies to human Happiness, Oppresion and Licentiousness, now governed by the barbarian Rule of ambitious Fools and impolitic Madmen, to whose Fury Candor, Honor, [and] Virtue are equally liable to fall a Sacrifice. Nor did you Consider the Difficulty. For while such Scenes of Confusion & Distraction maintain the Ascendant in America; a lawless Power established in most of the Colonies, to which the regular Magistracy of the Constitutional one in some places reluctantly, and in others willingly, submit--the invaluable Liberty of the Press destroyd--America arming in the East and West in Opposition to her Parent State, and that State sending over Fleets and Troops to support her ancient Authority, it seems scarcely in the Power of the wisest of Men to pick out principles upon which Prudence woud justify him in risquing his Judgment on Public Affairs. But however these Things may be, seeing you request it, I will not only now, but occasionally, run the Hazard, under a Confidence that my Sentiments, however mistaken or erroneous, will be safe when deposited in the Bosoms of my Friends.(2) From a View of all the Facts as well before as since the year 1763, I have no Doubt but the Dispute between the two Countries is now near its Crisis, and will be soon settled, more to the Advantage of both than had it been longer postponed. And whether it be deter mined by Arms or otherwise, Great Britain will never give up her Supreme Authority in any Case or Circumstance whatever. Because a Surrender of it will be a yielding up the Colonies to themselves, and casting so many Members out of the Circle of her Jurisdiction, and consequently depriving herself of the Power of deriving, with any kind of Certainty, the least Benefit from them; there being, as yet, Nothing ever invented, in the forms of any Kind of Government, which can give the State the necessary Command over its Members but the Legislative Authority. It is this which cements the Whole together in one Politic Body, and enables that Body to compell every Part of it to act in Concert for the general Good. Nor can she, in my Opinion, upon any good Policy, suffer it to be in the least impaired,  as that woud be weakening a System, by a division of its principles and their Operations upon the Preservation of which entire, its whole Strength materially depends. A Conduct of this kind is therefore so inconsistant with the Principles of all Governmts, her own Interest and Welfare, and the Power and Dignity she holds among Nations, that I have ever thought it, the greatest of all Absurdities in America to expect it.(3) But, it seems, America is of a different Opinion, and beleives, if I may judge from her Conduct, that G. Britain will yield up the only Principle of Union which can form them into one State; and she has accordingly resolved on the Part she will Act. The Language she hold[s] up to the World is--\""That the Colonies are entitled to a free and exclusive Power of Legislation in their several Provincial Legislatures, subject only to the Negative of the Crown.\"" The Parliament is not even to retain the Power of repealing a Law of the Colonies. But, out of their mere Grace & Favor, they \""Consent to the Operation of\"" [not to the Power of making] \""such Acts of Parliament as are\"" [not shall be hereafter] \""bona fide restrained to the Regulation of our external Commerce.\""(4) And yet this is to be done if it be possible to do it, which many will doubt, \""for the purpose of Securing the Commercial Advantage of the whole Empire to the Mother Country, and the Commercial Benefits of its respective Members.\"" But how the Commercial Benefits of the whole Empire can be secured to the Mother Country and at the Same Time to its American Members, I think will puzzle a Casuist to determine. Here we have American Claims and Pretensions. Thus the Issue is join'd between the two Countries--The one asserting her Supremacy in all Cases whatever, and the other denying it in all. And the Measures, which the latter seems determind to pursue in Maintenance of her Claims, are already carrying into Execution. They are, a Refusal of all Commercial Connection, and if that should not succeed, Opposition to the Exercise of Parliamentary Jurisdiction by Arms, if necessary. When these Facts shall appear, beyond a Doubt, to the grand Council of the Nation; when they find that the Claims of the Colonies are evidently the Claims of Independency, will it not strike them with the most alarming Apprehensions, and in all Probability induce them to exert their whole Strength to Suppress a Spirit so dangerous to their future Welfare, if not to their Existence as an independant Nation, shoud their whole Strength be necessary for the Purpose? That she will do this, unless some unforeseen Event shall intervene to pre vent it, seems more than probable from her former Conduct, which has been more firm and uniform than many imagined. Before the last War G. Britain seemed little acquainted with the Value and Importance of America. The Intercourse between them during that Period opened her Eyes, and placed the Colonies before them in their most  alluring Forms. And therefore she was determined to preserve an Object which was of such great Consequence to her, and which she had retaind at the Expence of so much Blood and Treasure. With this View G. Britain has maintained, ever since, at her own Expence, a Military Force in most of the Commercial Cities in America. But it was not her Design to retain America meerly for the sake of expend ing her own Strength in Protecting her. Her Views were rational and therefore went farther. They were to add Strength & Dignity and a farther security to the British Empire. And therefore she expected that the Colonies, as Members of the State, shoud, as they certainly ought, contribute their just and reasonable Proportion of Aids, towards those important Ends. She well knew that this was the primary and essential Duty of every Member of a Society. But having found from all the Experience which the last War afforded, that the Colonies neither did, nor were in a Capacity from their Disunion, to comply with this rational Obligation upon any princple of Justice either in respect to themselves or the Mother State, the Parliament passed the Stamp Act. This Act, tis true, was soon after repealed, but that repeal was occasioned more by the State of Parties at that Time at Court, than any Alteration of Sentiment in the British Legislature respecting their Right, or to the Measures taken for that Purpose by America. Of this Truth the Declaratory and sundry other Subsequent Act [s] are full proof. But shoud any one doubt, after considering these Proofs of a Resolution in the British Government to maintain its Legislative Authority over us at all Adventures let him consider its Conduct in Respect to the Duty on Tea, the Manner of sending that Commodity to the Colonies for Sale, the Plan & firm Measures Concerted and pursued to enforce the Act--The Boston Port Bill-the one for the Alteration of their Government--The Act for trial of American Offenders &c and I think they must remove every Doubt which either Hope or Ignorance or Inattention to the Facts may have raised. The Parliament is now sitting--The proceedings of the American Congress with the Resolves of all the Provincial Congresses and County Committees are before them. The Spirit of American Independency breathing throughout all of them will be painted in the strongest oratorial Colours, and the Necessity for vigorous and firm Measures to subdue it urged with Success, and Supplies granted to carry them into effectual Execution. Fleets and Troops will cross the Atlantic early in the Spring: the one to take Care of the Ports and Coasts the other to secure the Dependency of the Commercial Cities in America. These purposes effected, the Experience of Ages informs us that the internal Parts of a Country dependant on Commerce for its Health, and in many Respects for the Conveniencies and Comforts of Life cannot hold out long. The Stopage of our Trade,  which, perhaps will be but a small Part of the Business of those Fleets & Troops will alone throw America into Convulsions insupportable. The Merchant without Trade, the Mechanics without Employ, and the Farmer without a Sale for his Produce, will feel a new Distress and one as intolerable as new. They will then, and not before, enquire for themselves into the Cause of their Misfortunes, and that Enquiry in all Probability will lead them to a Submission. But shoud the Force of the Mother Country be exerted against us, how little will all the threatened Opposition of the American Congress avail? Where are their Fleets or Armies? There are Men, but where their discipline--their Veteran Officers, their Arms or Ammunition, their Money, or their Power to form and enforce the Execution of a Plan of Opposition to the Valour and Strength of one of the most Powerful Nations in the World? All the Art, Sophistry and Heroism of the greatest American Heroes to be found in a late Convention will not be able to sustain the Shock nor raise the Sinking Spirits of the deluded People. This is only a light shaded Picture of the Distress in which, I have been long apprehensive, the rash and violent Proceedings of the Short-sighted American Politicians woud involve their Country. I have therefore opposed them whenever I met them in my Small sphere of Public Life; and used my utmost Endeavours to prevail on America to pursue a safer and more rational Conduct. The Plan of Negotiation wou'd have been, in my Opinion the Plan of Safety; it woud have led us into the Harbour of Liberty--to a firm & solid Establishment of our Rights, and to an Union with the Mother State upon Principles of permanent Freedom. Nor wou'd it have been a difficult task for the late Congress to have taken this Ground, had their Principles disposed them to an Union with the British Government. The Materials are always at Hand to a Person acquainted with the History of the Colonies--their Connection with G. Britain and the Principles of the English Constitution. The History of the Colonies afford abundant Proof that they are, and can be considered in no other Light than Members of the British Government. The Territory was discovered by Sebastian Cabot, authorised for that Purpose by Henry the 7th, Sovereign Trustee of the English State, under the Great Seal--the Seal of the State--or the Seal of the King Lords and Commons.(5)The Intent of the Discovery was to increase the Territory, extend the Commerce and add to the Wealth and Power of the State. The Charters of Settlement have been all granted in the same Manner under the Authority of the Great Seal and by the subsequent Kings in their Politic, not private, Capacity, and as the Sovereign Representative of the politic Body of the whole State. In many of them the Purposes before mentioned are declared to be the Objects and Designs of the Grants. There is no Exemption in any of them,  save one, and that is a partial Exemption from the Legislative Authority of the Parliament: and had there been such an Exemption in all of them it woud have been an Excess of the Royal Authority & void. The Colonies being thus clearly the Property of the English Government they have been settled by its Subjects chiefly emigrating from its Bowels & owing Allegiance and Obediance to it. During the Infancy of their Settlement and to this Day they have been fosterd and Protected under its Guardianship and Power; and have ever Submitted to the Legislative Authority as well in Matters of Internal and external Taxation as internal Police untill the Commencement of the present Dispute. This is a just Epitome of Facts too well supported by authentic Documents and History to be denied. Upon what Reason or Policy then can the Colonies deny the Authority of the British State, refuse to be represented in its Parliament, and decline to make Proposals of some Kind of a Political Union between the two Countries? Surely upon none. For while we stand upon this Ground the wisest among us are bewilderd. All the Attempts which have been made by our greatest Patriots, to settle a Line of Parliamentary Jurisdiction, or to point out an Existing American Constitution have proved unsatisfactory and indeed truly ridiculous, and stand opposed by the following Solemn Truths. That the Territory upon which we are Settled is the Right and Property of the State whose Jurisdiction we deny. That we settled under its Licence and Authority. That the great Design of our Settlement was to increase the Wealth Strength and Dignity of the Nation. That we have been ever Protected by its Wealth and Power. That we are truly Members of the Empire and owe Allegiance to its Supreme Head. And further when we look into the Nature of Civil Society, and trace the Principles upon which all Governments ever were established, we find that none ever did, or can in the Nature of Things, exist, without a Supreme Legislative Authority exercising a complete and full Jurisdiction over every Member and part of it. And Yet such is the Folly, may I not say the Frenzy of America that, in the Face of these glaring Facts and this universally acknowledged Principle, she seems determined to set up for Herself, plunge into Rebellion and subject her People to all the Horrors of a civil War, in which she must be infallibly subdued, rather than Petition for or negotiate an Union with Britain, upon Grounds which woud secure to Her the full Rights and Liberties of a Government which is allowed by all Authors to be the most excellent in the World for securing the Happiness of its People. Here, as a Friend to America, and as a Person interested in her Welfare and deeply Affected with the Prospect of her Distress, I condemn the late Measures as untenable and altogether insupportable. I have ever thought, that a Political Union, between the two  Countries founded on the Principles of the English Constitution, which shoud secure, to the Mother State a regular and faithful Discharge of the reasonable Duties of the Colonies, and to the Colonies those Antient Rights and that Freedom which their Ancestors enjoyd in Britain, was what America ought to ask and all she ought to desire. To obtain this Union is certainly more the Interest of America than Great Britain.(6) The latter supported her Dignity as a Nation for many centuries before America was known, and yet has immense wealth and Power of her own, and besides is connected with the most Potent States in Europe, whose Interest it wd. be to Support her were the Colonies annihilated. But in what situation are the Colonies with out an Union with G. Britain. They are weak in themselves, and many of them hold an Enemy within their own Bowels ready to destroy them. With Respect to each other, they are in a perfect State of Nature, destitute of any Supreme Authority among themselves either to decide their Disputes, or to compel them to act in Concert for their Common Safety. Their different Forms of Government--Productions of Soil--and Views of Commerce, their different Religions --Tempers and private Interests--their Prejudices against, and Jealousies of, each other--all have, and ever will, from the Nature and Reason of things, conspire to create such a Diversity of Interests Inclinations, and Decisions, that they never can unite together even for their own Protection. In this Situation Controversies founded in Interest, Religion or Ambition, will soon embrue their Hands in the Blood of each other, when the Authority of G. Britain ceases to exist over them; or they will become an Easy Prey to every foreign Invader. You will now enquire how is this Union to be obtained, Since the Parliament will not hear the Petitions of the Colonies? Great Pains have been taken to delude the good People of America into a Belief, that his Majesty and the two Houses of Parliament have refused to hear the reasonable Petitions of the Subject and with too much Success. (7) Tis true the Parliament has treated with Neglect perhaps Contempt, the American Petitions when they Spoke Nothing but the Language of Independency, when they denied the Authority of the Supreme Legislature, and a Capacity in the Colonies to be represented in Parliament, without proposing any other System of Polity to bring them within the Circle of Members of the State. Shoud a Child take Umbrage at the Conduct of a Parent, and deny his Authority over him, tell him he was not his father nor woud he consider himself as his Child on any Terms, wou'd the Parent Listen to such undutiful Language or woud he not immediately exercise his parental Authority to bring his Child to Reason & Duty? But let the Americans take up another Language and Act upon rational Principles and we have Reason to know that we shall be heard and attended to. Let us in our  Petitions tell them that we see the Necessity of a Supreme Legislature over every Member of the State--That we acknowledge, the Colonies are Members of the British Government. But as by our Settling and improving a Desart Wilderness we have greatly increased the Commerce Wealth and Power of the Nation and thereby thrown Ourselves out of the Circle of the Liberties of that Government, we ought in all Equity to be restored to them. That the English Government is founded in Freedom--That this Freedom depends on its particular Constitution, in which it is and ever was essential and fundamental, that the Landed Interest, or the Freeholders of every Part of its Territory shoud be represented in and participate the Supreme Legislative Authority. That this Priviledge it is alone, which distinguishes British Subjects from the Slaves of the most despotic Govern ments. And therefore that we most ardently desire to be restored to this invaluable Right and all other Priviledges of the British State, upon such Grounds as best suit our local Circumstances. A Petition of this kind, so reasonable and just and so well established on the Principles of their own Government, attended with such a Plan of Union as shoud be wisely digested, and carried to the Parliament by one or more Delegates of each Colony must have been heard and at tended to; must have divided the Nation in our Favor, created us in numerable Friends, by whose Weight and Influence and the Rectitude of our Cause we shoud have obtained a full Redress of our Grievances and a permanent System of Union with the Mother State upon Principles of Liberty and Safety. Had this Controversy been of the first Impression, I shoud not be surprized to find the American Politician so much at a Loss for Facts and Principles so often changing their Ground and so bewildered in all their Arguments. (8) But as the Case of America and the dispute thence arising is not Novel in the English Government, I confess I know not whether to attribute the Incertainty--the Fickleness of their Conduct to a total Ignorance of the Merits, or to a Design of throwing off all Political Connections with the Mother State. However this may be, it is most certain that Precedents of the like Dispute and the Remedy by which they were happily reconciled are not wanting The Principality of Wales, the Palatine of Chester, and the Bishoprick of Durham labourd under the like Grievances and were for many Years bound by the Authority of Parliament without being there represented. Great Discord and Sedition flowed from this slavish Distinction between the Subjects of the same State. The injured Inhabitants of those Districts severally and at distant Periods pursued for their Relief the same Remedy I have before pointed out. The Equity and Justice of their Claims and their Right to participate the supreme Power which held an universal Controul over their Conduct, and Authority to bind them in Matters of so much Importance as  Life Liberty &c property were so irresistably solid, that they became upon their several Petitions vested with all the Rights & Liberties of the English Government and particularly with that of a Share in the Legislative Council. When H. 3. conquered Calais and settled it with English Subjects; it was held so inconsistent with English Freedom that the Legislative Authority should extend to a Member of the State which held no Share in it, that they were incorporated in the British Government and vested with the same great and important Priviledge. These apposite Precedents, affording such solid Grounds of lasting Redress before the Eyes of the American Politician, what Infatuation coud possess them not to pursue them with such variation as best suited the local Circumstances of their Country? However this is not done. And I fear we have foolishly and wantonly lost the only Opportunity Providence will ever lay before US. The fatal Declaration of Independency and the Manifestoes containing the frantic Resolutions of maintaining it by Arms are gone forth, and even sounded in the Ears of the British Lion. He is before this Time roused--and unless the Mercy & Nobility of his Nature shoud mingle Liberty with his Power, into what ineffable Misery and Distress must America be involved. Thus I have, in Haste given you my Sentiments in the Abstract Shoud they in any Degree contribute to your Amusement or that of any of our Friends it will give me Pleasure. Beleive me, always, with unfeigned Esteem, Dear Sir, your obliged and most Obedient Servant Jos. Galloway ""

You say, \""you do not altogether acquiesce with . . . explicit approbation our Assembly have given to the Proceedings of the Con- gress.\"" In this you do not much differ in opinion from me, as I totally disagree with them in all, and think they have not taken one foot of that ground which they should have taken. When I went to the Assembly and found they had approved of the measures of the Congress so fully, and had appointed me one of the Delegates at the next, I very explicitly told them, that I entirely disapproved of them.(2) I did so in Congress and continued yet of the same opinion and that I might not appear to undertake the Execution of measures which my judgement and conscience disapproved I could not serve them as a Delegate at the ensuing Congress. And yet I could not prevail in persuading them to a new appointment in my stead. The conduct of this Assembly in this Respect has given great uneasiness to many. The men of Property begin to think & speak their JANUARY 14, 1775  Sentiments, and I hope will in a little time take that Lead which their Consequence entitle them to. But I conclude this will not be the case until the measures of Parliament are known, and they can hope to be protected in their upright conduct. A Committee has been appointed for this County by a few warm People of neither Property or significance among us. But I think they have found it so contrary to the sense of the Country that they will not attend the Provincial Congress.

Mrs & Miss Galloway unite with me in our best Compliments to Mrs. Verplanck. Mrs. Galloway enjoins me not to forget as I did in my last to request Mrs. Verplanck to propose her compliments to Mrs. Ludlow, and return her grateful thanks for the very acceptable and plentiful present of Roots. Miss Galloway has received the gloves, with which she is extremely pleased, particularly with the work on the Back, for which she is much obliged to Mrs. Verplanck. The china is arrived safe.

Since Galloway did not take his seat until the 13th, he had not participated in the debate on the consideration of the proceedings. From December 22 to 24, the assembly debated instructions for the delegates elected to attend the Second Congress in May 1775, but final action on the instructions was postponed to the February 1775 session.

They are laughed at by every Man of sense here. Gentn here know better the  May 12, 1775  state of Britain and America. But I can tell them, for their Comfort, that Britain has neither Troops nor Money, to engage in a twenty Years War with all North America.
