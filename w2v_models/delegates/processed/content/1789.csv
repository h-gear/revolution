 Dr. Sir Philadelphia 27. May [17]87 New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Virginia, North & South Carolina were represented on Friday; and the convention proceeded to appoint Genl.

 Dear Sir: New York, 5th January, '89. Your favor of the 11th ult. came to hand three days ago. The post in cold weather seems to move slowly. I am very glad that the subject of the new Constitution is to be again before the citizens of North Carolina.(1) Presuming that the same cause that prevented your attendance at the last meeting of the Assembly will prevent you from attending at the next Convention and Assembly, I shall, in such case only, assure the inhabitants of Edenton of my readiness to serve them; but if you can make it convenient to attend as the representative of that town, which I heartily wish, I shall offer to serve some of the counties as delegate in the Convention only. I have, as you may believe, the business much at heart, and wish to add my small mite to the endeavors of our friends. January 5, 1789  Mrs. Williamson,(2) who has at this instant been inquiring to whom I am writing, and been informed that I am writing to an inhabitant of Edenton, who is a particular friend, and one of the best men, as well as best lawyers in America, says that either of these circumstances would induce her to present you with her compliments, but all of them united engage her to request that I would present you with a tender of her esteem, &c. Hu. Williamson. MS not found; reprinted from McRee, Iredell Correspondence, 2:248. 1 Following North Carolina's rejection of the federal Constitution in August, a call for a second state convention was adopted November 30, 1788, although it did not actually convene until November 16, 1789. 2 For Williamson's recent marriage, see John Dawson to James Madison, January 29?, note 7.

 Dr Sir New York Jan 10 1789. I did myself the pleasure of writing you sometime ago(1) which letter I hope you have received as it contained the agreable information of the good health of all of your relations and acquaintances whom I knew, since then I have had the satisfaction of being introduced to a number of valuable characters, and amongst them though at the head in my opinion is Mr. Jay, from some cause unknown to my self I had ever entertained the highest estimation of the Ability and Principle of this gentleman. Neither his Official writings nor his conversation gave me room to think this predilection misplaced. The most happy talent in the distribution of his Subjects, the closest reasoning and the most impartial Reports combine to render him the most proper person for the Office which he holds, and on seing him and hearing him speak (the purity of his language excepted) could I believe the transmigration of souls. I could readily distinguish the same Spirit and appearance which belonged to and inspired a Hamden and a Pym. The Politicks of this State are at present particularly interesting. The spirit of Party might be said to rage here. The Senate and house of Representatives, now sitting at Albany, are devided in sentiment upon the mode of choosing Senators and Electors, the Senate have a FOEderal majority of four in twelve, the other house an Anti--;FOEderal majority of eight in thirty two. The latter are for choosing the abovementioned persons according to the principle of the State Constitution. The Senate stickle for the appointment of one Senator and half  January 10, 1789  of the Electors. In the one case they will devide and consequently almost render useless their representation. In the other the vote of the State will be entirely and invariably opposed to the New Government. The Men of character, ability and FOEderal principles in this City expect and hope that the Senate will not yield, in which case the probability is, that they will neither appoint Senators or Electors, and even this is here considered as being better than the suffering of the unacommodating Anti-FOEderal spirit to commix with the Government. This is certainly a subject of considerable import both as it respects the State and the Union. As it respects the State, because it has established a System of party gover[n]ment which most certainly will tinge every transaction unconnected or not with the New Government, and as it relates to the Union, because it will snagg into their consideration the question so much disliked of the powers which are vested in their Representatives of direction, the Times, Manners and places of holding and conducting elections. A Question of the most forbidding aspect and of the most painfull tendency. This interesting business will be, soon, or rather is decided upon already. Although no intelligence has been here received of it, in a few days we shall hear its issue and as I cannot delay the dispatch of this letter, I will do myself what I am apprehensive the writing to you can alone make the pleasure of informing you of it by the next opportunity. You doubtless wish to hear whether we have made a Congress and what we are like to do. The backwardness of the neighbouring Members hath hitherto prevented us from forming a house, although we expect it daily. Should we be able to proceed to business, a question of considerable importance will I imagine be gone into upon the subject of an agreement relating to the delivery of Fugitives on our part and that of Spain. I had a conversation with Mr Jay a few days ago on this point and he seems to make not the leastdoubt, but that Don D. de Gardoqui will treat upon this seperately from a general treaty. This to us would be as important in its consequences as it was unexpected on my part. This is so generally spoken of that I do not think it improper to speak of to you. You will do me the favor to say nothing about it, if you perceive an impropriety. I meant to have said something more but the opportunity presses and I have but time to request my most respectful compliments to Mrs Kean and to assure you, With how much Sincerity I am Your Humble Servt, Robt Barnwell ""

 Dear Sir New York 24th Jany 1789 Having read the inclosed more than once as you may conclude from its Dress, I verily thought that I had forwarded it to you long since for it contains some good Funnical Remarks. If it has not hitherto appeard in Edenton be so good as hand it to the Govr. after you have had your Laugh. The Genl. Assembly of this State after spending near 2 months in pure wrangling, during which Time many of them have had the felicity to make a clear saving of one Dlr per day, have at length agreed to divide the state into six Election Districts for the choice of Representatives in the new Congress.(1) They cannot yet agree about the mode of chusing Senators. The House of commons want to have all Antis & the Senate wish to have at least one of the Congress Senators a federal Man.  Some Time ago I wrote you that in Case our State should agree to try the Effects of a new Convention I should be glad to take a Seat in the same if chosen. There can be no great Harm in saying that Edenton may be more effectively represented both in Convention & Assembly than by its present Member. To the best of my Recollection the Convention sits very near the Time when the superiour Court of Newbern sits. I have nevertheless some Hope that there is not an absolute Interference and that you will be able to represent our Town in the Convention though probably not in the Assembly. I am very indifferent about whether I am in the Assembly or not, my Object is the Convention but I would also of choice serve in the Assembly also, for if the Constitution is adopted some interesting Business comes on before the Assembly. If you can serve Edenton in both Capacities, so much the better for the public & in that Case I shall offer for one of the Counties in Convention only and I think the competition for that particular Office will not be very great. If you can serve for the Convention only, I shall be glad to serve the Town in the Assembly & shall offer to serve one of the Counties, as in the otherCase, in Conven- January 24, 1789  tion. I have not yet determined for which of the Counties I should offer with greatest Prospect of Success. If Captn. Collins should not be disposed to serve for Tyrrell or if his Business should make it inconvenient for him to attend I presume that with the Interest of the Lake Company I might secure an Election for the Convention in that County. In our own County of Chowan the double Representation will doubtless engage the chief competition but there will probably be sundry Candidates even for the two additional Seats in the Convention. I shall thank you for your advice on the whole of this Business. Be pleased present Mrs Iredell & the other Ladies in your Family with my Respects & believe me to be with great Esteem, Dr sir, Your obedt servt., Hu Williamson ""

 Sir, New York, 26th Jan'y, 1789. I had the honor of writing you a very few lines shortly after my arrival.(1) Mr. Gorham having arr'd since,(2) we have five states, and every reason to expect there will be seven in a week or ten days. The State of New York have not yet appointed Senators; nor does it appear probable they will appoint this Session. The day of electing Representatives, I am assured is fixed on the 2d Tuesday in March; as the Government is appointed to meet on the 4th, they probably will be some days unrepresented in the house rep's. This may be favourable to the removal of Congress. In a conversation last Night with Mr. Gorham, I find he and Mr. Philips,(3) who purchased of Massachusetts, all the lands between the line of pre-emption and the western bounds of New York, are of opinion that the words of the New York cession to Congress do not operate a transfer of the lands east of Erie to Congress, and of course that the jurisdiction remains in New York and that the property is vested in them under the grant of New York to Massachusetts---;'Tis certain that the grant or cession of New York discovers a considerable deficiency of Geographical information, which you will easily see, Sir, by recurring to it. The substance is that New York is to continue her South line along our North line to the end of the latter and so far beyond it as to throw a particular part of the Western Waters (the western Bend of Lake Ontario), 20 miles east of a line to be run from the extremity of the South line aforesaid to the 45th degree of N. Latitude. It is now ascertained, that the 20 miles east of the place in contemplation will be contained within a line that will fall far on this side Erie. The question  January 26, 1789  will be, what will be the Consequence of this geographical Error? My opinion on a slight examination is, that it will leave our purchase good. Mr. Gorham seems desirous, if the law proves theirs to sell to Pennsylvania, but it is necessary that we remember their doctrine deprives us of the Jurisdiction, for New York most probably will not part with it. I think it proper to add further that Mr. Gorham raised a question, whether the grant of the Jurisdiction to Penns'a by Congress was valid. These loose hints, Sir, upon so important a point are not fit in form, at least, for the public Eye, but it is necessary, that you, and the other superior characters in our government should be apprized of the difficulty which is attempted to be raised. The purchase made of the Indians by Mr. Gorham & Co., (part of their whole purchase of the state) begins at our 82d mile stone, and runs along our N. line to the 124th, and then runs due N. to the great Fork of the Genesee river. The tract of country is about 42 miles E. & W., & about 70 miles N. & S., computed to contain 2 millions of acres, divided into Townships of 6 miles Squares about one hundred in number. Of these Townships 35 are sold lying on the N.E. quarter principally, the remainder being on the Genesee River. Those on our line are yet unsold. It appears clear to me that the most accessible Market for this part of their purchase must be down the Tioga, which renders the settlement of that country a beneficial thing to us in regard to commerce, as it evidently is also in regard to defence from the Indians. They sell in specie from 14d to 18d lawful per acre, with the Townships only run out, so that the expence of subdividing remains. The accounts of the situation of the King of Great Britain renders his death, at this moment, highly probable, and his restoration to any vigor of mind or body (if he should live), almost impossible. A dropsical disease, accompanyed with symptoms of excessive taint in his blood, and with disorder inhis mind, has invaded his whole muscular system. The derangement of the funds of England, whose public credit has been most ingeniously and wonderfully extended, as her debts became alarmingly great, appears to me a very probable Consequence of a change of Kings with its usual consequences a change of Ministers, principles and systems. By letters of the 21st of Novem., from Bristol, the British King was not dead at that time.

14880,dg025349,1789,Tench Coxe to James Madison,"""Tench Coxe to James Madison
 Dear Sir, New York 27th. Jany 1789. I have been here about a Fortnight during which time we have not made a Congress. So. Carolina, Virga, Pennsa, N. Jersey, & Massachussets are represented. There is one Member from each of the States of Rhode Island, N. Carolina & Georgia, but none from New Hampshire, Connecticut, N. York, Delaware or Maryland. I very much wish we may make a house in a week or ten days, as I think the Appearance in Europe, & perhaps even here, of the old Congress being in full operation and tranquilly yielding the seats to the new would have a good effect. The misrepresentations in Europe have been extremely gross, and must have an unfavorable effect upon Emigration in the poorer ranks of life. Col. Wadsworth has been mentiond as President. I respect him much, but I wish to give appearance to the old System by a Character of rather more celebrity. Mr. Adams would meet my Judgment better than any member of the present house. The principal Objection is his Absence, which I fear will deprive him of his chance. The federal business in Pennsa. is happily closed. Our Electors, & Senators are all federal, & seven of our Reps.(1) ---;the eighth is a German, so that I doubt not he will feel the influence of the federalism of his countrymen which is actual, and he will also I think, from being rather fond of public office, feel the federalism of the state. His Sentiments were doubting if not opposed to the Constitution. He is a man of private virtue, some Patriotism & judgment, and not ignorant of the Affairs of Pennsylvania. In our state politics he has been a constitutionalist latterly a mild one, that is a prudent politician. The State of New York still retain their impressions against the Constitution. They still decline to elect Senators upon legislative principles, and I think an absence of two of the Senate is, from Appearances determined on to avoid the precedent of conceding their due legislative independence. They will have two antifdlts, and no Merchant ontheir Senate. Massachussets & Pennsa. alone have attended to mercantile character in the Senate,(2) which will assist in obviating the Objections to the commercial powers of that body. This is in favor of the Constitution, but possibly not so favorable to the interests of the Union as if there were five or six merchants. The practice under the Constitution will, in my opinion, be more agreeable to the Opposition in many other particulars than their leaders are aware of. In this particular instance it is fortunate that our Senator is a man of extensive political information, and landed property and, tho a practical Merchant, a friend to a pretty free System of Trade. I do not think the most captious agriculturist in the Senate will find Mr. Morris tenacious of any principle that will be injurious to the landed interest. January 27, 1789  The election of New Jersey for Electors is federal.(3) This with the choice of their Senators augurs well with regard to the reps. I do not find any doubt that there will be two fedts. among them, most probably three and I think very probably four. The federalism of Jersey, and its obligations and inducements to adhere to the union & a vigorous system of federal politics, will be a pretty strong Security for the good Conduct of her Representatives. The re-election of a federalist for a Senator by New Hampshire is a symptom of the continuance of the Acquiescence of that State in the Constitution. Mr. Wingate I mean in the room of Mr. Bartlett.(4) I find too they think of Mr. Adams as V.P. which also shews there is no violent discontent. There are good Symptoms also in the Elections so far as known here. Massachussetts seems also to evince feelings equally favorable, and Connecticut still more. I understand however from Dr. Johnson that the latter State mean to remove all their Senators & reps. from all state offices. This tho merely from general republican reasons will probably lose us an individual or two of the Senate & house of Reps. Mr. Ellsworth, and I think Mr. Sherman are of the state Judiciary. They will be great losses to the government, if they adhere to their state Appointments. Delaware has given us federalists altogether, and I believe Maryland.(5) From this detail, of wch. I presume you knew the greater part before I think the Government will be well supported from the North side of the Powtowmack, even in the house of Reps. New York by her districts will have two federalists & very able ones I hope. The Election of Virga. is an Object of great Anxiety with me---; not that I hope or fear much, for I presume the ticket will have a very moderate portion of federalism. But, Sir, when [I] examine the list of representatives & see how few are yet returned and how few are likely to be returned to that house, who are able to take the lead in a scene of that kind Iconfess I feel some apprehensions about the advantages the opposition may gain from the Speakers of your state, and the greatest solicitude lest we should be deprived of that support which your ticket may give us. I most sincerely hope this will find your own election secured. The Senate was in my mind not the place in which the cause required you to be in any point of view, but one that there seemed little probability that your legislature would favor the pretensions of any federalist unless they would elect you. Your election would be a gain therefore, wch. could not perhaps be otherwise secured, but the Senate was never the place where my fears rested. I therefore felt little regret at the issue of the choice by your state.(6) The house of Representatives is a scene of the utmost importance.(7) If happily conducted little is to be feared---;if it proves unfriendly great talents---;great exertions---;great public estimation in favor of our leading friends will be necessary to prevent the most serious evils---;if it cannot   be induced to countenance the constitution the unanimity of the Senate would, under present circumstance avail but little. The election of the President seems likely to be unanimous. It is perhaps the greatest personal point that will ever occur in this Country, that it be secure---;and I feel the most cordial satisfaction in considering it beyond all hazard. The Office of V.P. seems destined for Mr. Adams, who will have nearly all Pennsa, Delaware & New England, probably Jersey. Mr. Rutlege I understand will be pushed by S. Carolina, and Mr Jay who is the only candidate besides that is talked off [of] will have but little support in this Matter left. He appears to have no Views himself. Tho well qualified for more important station than the proper Duties of the VP. render that yet I think it would be wrong to draw him for the Office of foreign affairs. Our treaties are all unformed---;he alone knows the whole Negociations---;he is among the very few who have been in the way of qualifying themselves for foreign negociation. He is much esteemed in Pennsa. but her votes & influence would be exerted against him in the present state of the question on the seat of Government. Mr. Adams is esteemed by the people---;has high ideas of Government---;is a friend to property---;will take the feelings of New England with him---;has been used to the forms of legislative & diplomatic business---;he is a man of a pure private Character, & has knowledge & abilities beyond the proper duties of a V.P. which indeed are not very important. He will lose few votes, I think from the North side of Maryland (where also he is seriously thought of) but from an apprehension that he may outrun the genl. or hazard the election of the latter. This tho in my mind a very small hazard indeed I am pleased to observe is foreseen, and will be attended to. Mr. Dawson assures me this letter will reach you if sent to the Office at Fredericksburg which is the Reason of my sending that way. I am with very greattruth, dear Sir, yr. respectful & aff. h.

A Sufficient number of Delegates to form a Congress not being convened, I thought it my Duty to consult those who are here,(2) on the answer proper to be given to that Part of your Letter which respects Conolly.(3) They are of opinion with me, That a watchful Eye should be kept over him; and if found chargeable with the Practices you mention (either within your Jurisdiction, or that of one of the States) that he should be apprehended, and delivered to the State in which the offences may be committed, together with the Evidence of them---;but if the offences should be committed within your Jurisdiction, it will be best to detain him until Congress shall give orders on the Subject. There not being any fOEderal Tribunal, nor general Laws for defining and punishing Treason against the united States---;nor a congress sitting, nor likely soon to be convened, are Reasons for leaving such offenders to the Judicatures of the States in which their offences may be committed, until the new Governmt. shall be in operation.

 Dear Sir Jany 29th 1789 I have recd. your favors per the post to which I shall attend.(1) I shall immediately forward Mr. Adams's letter and do what you wish to Col. Smith who requested it of me.  It will be proper that Mr. Clymer & Mr. Fitzsimons know that I have discovered that there is some idea of attempting to declare their seats in the State legislature vacant on accot. of their election to the fed. house.(2) This information must not be extended far as coming from me. Mr. Wilson I think should be consulted. The argument is Clearly in favor of their right to their present seats---;they are only representatives in Congress elect, when sworn in there their present seats will be vacated. The Senators of New York will lessen their Majority of fed[eralis]ts. I think by two voluntary absences, and obtain by that method two Senators for Congress among whom there will be neither federalism nor mercantile knowlege most probably. I think the cause appears in a good way. There will be a pretty large portion of federalism in the house of reps. This state I think will certainly have two fedsts. and the chance is of more from the favorable mode of electing. It was strange in the Opposition to consent to this mode, but Quam [...] Jurdere &ca.

 Dear sir [January 29? 1789](1) Since I wrote you(2) nothing worthy your attention has presented itself; We have now six states on the floor viz Massachusetts-bay, New York, New Jersey, Pennylvania, S. Carolina and Virginia; and a member from Rhode Island, North Carolina & Georgia---;another member from Rhode Island is on his way and one from N.C. in Pennylvania. Connecticut, you know can come in at any time; we therefore expect in three or four days to have nine states represented. Colo Wardsworth, I think will be chosen President. I have lately receivd an address from the convention of Kentucky, respecting the navigation of the Mississippi;(3) this will be laid before Congress on their meeting; you are well aware of the difficulties which will attend this business; especially as there will not be more than nine states represented, some of which are in favour of the surrender of the river to Spain, in which number I am sorry to include South Carolina. The business of Colo Morgan, with the Court of Spain,(4) which you mentiond to me at Philadelphia I find much more important than I at first apprehended; in my opinion it will prove an interesting era in the American history & furnisheth many arguments for U. States insisting on the free navigation of the Mississippi. I have lately seen some letters from Hutchins, and there remains not a dout but the emigrations to the New Madrid will be very great. How long these neighbours will prove friendly to Spain, or how soon she will have cause to repent of her policy is very doutful, & can only be determind by time. We are told, & I presume you heard it before you left this that a negociation is on foot between France & Spain by which New Orleans & the Floridas are to be exchan[ge]d for some of the French Islands. Shoud this event take place, and France pursues that line of policy which she has hitherto observd, it may prove highly beneficial to our western country, as well as to that Kingdom. No packet is yet arrivd from Europe. Privateaccounts say that Mr. Fox is gone up to the house of Lords, as Lord Holland. In consequence of a dispute which has taken place, & which has continued for three weeks between the two houses of assembly it is expected that there will not be any Senators to the New Government, appointed by this State. The house of delegates, in which there is a  January 29, 1789  large majority unfriendly to the Govert. wish to make the choice by Joint ballot, and the Senate insist, that one nominated by them shall be elected. How this dispute will end I cannot say, but expect the fear of the seat of Govert. being removd from this place will induce both sides to be less obstinate than otherwise they woud be.(5) We hear from Massachusetts, that in their late election, only one person, (Mr Thacher) was chosen, their act requiring a majority of the whole to make good an appointment.(6) This game may continue for some time, as the friends on all sides will become warmer, & the second election is not confind to the two Candidates who had the most votes, but is on the same plan, as the first.  Williamson, from N.C. was marrid a few days since to a Miss Apthorp, a beautiful girl, about twenty two.(7) She appears much pleasd with her bargain---;may she never repent. The Marchioness charges me to present her best wishes to you. Yr. Friend, J Dawson ""

 Sir New York. January 29th, 1789. Accept my grateful thanks for your friendly letter of the 14 Int. which I received by yesterdays Post. The states of Massachusetts bay, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia and South Carolina are now represented,(1) and altho they do  January 29, 1789  not make a congress, yet I consider it encumbent on me to communicate to the Executive of our State, some transactions which have come to my Knowledge. I have receivd an address to Congress from the Convention of Kentucky on the subject of the navigation of the Mississippi, coverd by a letter from the President.(2) This will be presented at the earliest moment, & in answer to the Presidents letter I have observd that it cannot, with propriety, be acted on by the present Congress, as there will not be more than nine states represented, some of which have ever been in favour of the surrender of that river to Spain. Colo Morgan, who was in treaty with Congress for a large tract of land, on the Mississippi, being disgusted at some conditions annexd to the ordinance, which he thought illiberal, has enterd into a plan with Mr. Gardoqui, the Spanish minister at this place, for settling a large tract of land, to be bounded by the parellel of Cape Cinque Homme on the North; the parellel of the mouth of St. Francis's river on the South; the Mississippi river on the East, and extending West two degrees of latitude, containing a country as fine in Soil and superior in trade to any in America.(3) This transaction, I consider of the most interesting nature, and on which will probably produce a remarkable Era in the American history, as a door will be opend through which the United States will loose many thousands of her best citizens. We have certain information that Morgan has already enterd into engagements with the most respectable characters, and the most useful farmers and tradesmen to go to New Madrid with him on the next year and a number of judicious people are gone with him to reconnoiter and survey the lands, on a plan far superior to that of Congress; and to lay out ground for a large city, as nearly opposite the mouth of the Ohio, as they shall judge expedient---;added to these circumstances the most sound assurances of freedom in religious matters---;a free navigation of the Mississippito New Orleans clear of all duties and taxes; besides being entitled to all the commercial priviledges which the citizens of New Orleans enjoy in any of the King of Spain's rich dominions, are inducements sufficient to draw the attention of the industrious and enterprising---;and altho the lands on the Ohio and its branches are very fine and productive, what benefit can be drawn from them more than a bare subsistance? without a market for their productions and consequently without commerce, the best inhabitants on these waters will emigrate to the equally good lands on the West side of the Mississippi, when peculiar priviledges will induce them to oppose other nations having the same advantages; hence discontents will arise at Kentucky &c against the goverment of the United States; a seperation will ensue and commercial and other treaties will be formd between Spain and the Western Anglo Americans for their mutual advantage and security. January 29, 1788  On yesterday the Secretary of foreign affairs laid before the attending members of Congress a letter from the Governor of the Western Territory, which containd information interesting to the Union in general and particularly to the state of Virginia.(4) The Gov. writes, that he has information on which he can depend that a Colo Conolly, who renderd himself fully conspicuous during the late war, has lately come from Detroit to Louisville---;that the apparent object of his Journey is the settlement of some private accompts, but that he has good reason to believe that he is employd to Lord Dorchester, (from whom he has lately receivd a pension of £200 Stg in addition to his half pay) to induce the people of Kentucky either to form a Connection [with] Great Britain, or to commit hostilities on the Spaniards---;that he has written to a number of persons, and has made some communications to Genl. Morgan. You will readily perceive, sir, that for the want of a Congress and a fOEderal tribunal, we coud do nothing decisive in this business. We however advisd the Secretary to write to Gov. St. Clair, and to advise him to keep a strict eye over Conolly, and if he found his suspicions well grounded to have him apprehended and delverd to the State in which he shoud be taken---;and to be careful to have his papers &c securd, as it woud probably bring on a national discussion. I doubt not but you before this have receivd the information which I now give, and have taken proper steps to secure Mr. Conolly, if the above mentiond suspicions are well founded. I, however, considerd it as my duty to make the communication especially as I think the business more properly belongs to a state, rather than the Continent---;these circumstances will, I trust, render any apology for the length of this letter, unnecessary. It still remains doubtful whether any Senators will the [be] appointed by this state; both houses adhering to their principle. They have however divided the state into districts for the choiceof members to the lower house, and have not made residence necessary. With sentiments of respect & esteem, I have the honour to be, Yr. Excellencys Most Ob hum Sert, J Dawson. ""

 Sir New York Jany 31st. 1789. I beg to be informed by the first opportunity about the mode in which the state of Pennsylvania settled with the Militia. I have some reason to belive that some of the states have paid or charge the usual pay of a soldier, with every necessary allowance in Money or certificates to make up the Depreciation. If our Accounts are not so stated we shall suffer & the settlement will be unequal and unjust. Messrs. Gorham, Phelps, Livingston & Co have effected Sales of 36 Townships (part of the grant of New York to Massachusetts[)] at 14 to 18 & even 22d per Acre, specie. It is supposed the Emigrants to this state in 1789 will be 5,000 men, women & children. They are peopling very fast indeed, but in all other respects, are in my Opinion far behind us. Their exports, tho they employ as much tonnage as we are not above £550,000 our Specie. Our flour is in quantity 3 times theirs---;and their wheat more than ours. If you could favor me with a list of the exports of Pennsa. for 1787 and for 1788 I should be much obliged to you. I hope our State will pursue the business of roads & take up that of improving rivers. The Susquehannah, Delaware & Schuylkill should be attended to this Summer, if it were only to appoint people to explore.

Five States only are represented in Congress altho I think it cannot be many days before we have seven & perhaps nine States. You are frequently enquired after & will be soon expected. When I did myself the honor to write you last(1) I took the liberty to solicit your interest for the appointment to be Clerk of the Senate, And as I have encouragment from my friends of success, I hope you will excuse my reiterating the subject.

 Mr. Kollock, New York, February 1, 1789 The following it is desired may find admission into your paper. To a person desirous of passing quietly through life with as little show and parade as possible, wishing rather to deserve esteem, than to obtain applause, any address to the public respecting himself, must be disagreeable, and, in some cases improper; yet in others, not only excusable but a duty. A charge, however false, which remains uncontra- February 1, 1789  dicted is readily believed. Every man in public life must expect to pass through ill, as well as good report, and though his calumniators are often too insignificant to merit a reply, or even occasion any resentment, yet it may sometimes happen otherwise. At present I am attacked, not openly in the public prints that I have heard of, but in a secret manner by letters, certificates, &c. sent privately into every part of the state, containing gross misrepresentations, and the most palpable falshoods, in order to prejudice the minds of the citizens against me at the coming election, and prevent my being appointed to a confidential trust: A trust of so much importance to the citizens of New-Jersey, that a diffidence of my abilities to execute it in a proper manner to their advantage, forbids any attempt of mine to push myself into it. It is however my duty, as well in private as in public life, to remove every unjust and illiberal charge against me, more especially, as in the present case, when coming from persons who, if they had a disposition for it, might render useful services to the community; I need not name them, they are characters well known in Jersey, as is also the cause of their clamours which may be considered as very remote from their regard to the interest of the citizens of the state. Those letters and certificates I have mentioned though intended as private stabs, from their number and circulation are become public and very notorious. One of their insinuations is that I am antifOEderal, and an enemy to the new government. The charge of antifOEderalism is of so general and undefined a nature, that had it not been followed by that of an enemy to the government, I should not have thought it worthy of notice, as that epithet is frequently given to all those who dare venture to suspect the least defect in the Constitution, in which is included by far the greatest part of the inhabitants of the United States: How far this charge is applicable to me, I leave the impartial publicto judge. That I used every means in my power in the different stations I filled, to obtain an efficient government, is well known and cannot be denied. When the plan of the new government appeared, I found it not such as I had wished and expected; I perceived, as I supposed, some parts of it bearing too hard upon the liberties of the people, and giving some unnecessary powers to those who were to administer it: This I never scrupled to mention when my opinion was desired. Notwithstanding my dislike to some parts, considering the situation the United States was in, and the provision made in the Constitution for amendments, I cheerfully gave my assistance to send it to the states for their consideration,(1) judging that New-Jersey, from its local situation and circumstances, could not with propriety reject it, notwithstanding its imperfections; presuming at the same time, that the new Congress would endeavor to amend it as soon as other important business for putting the government into operation would admit. This I yet hope and expect will, in a proper time, be effected in   Congress, but not by a future general convention, which would be inexpedient and dangerous to the union by leaving us without government for years to come. The story so industriously propogated, that I made offers to, and used endeavours with the Convention of Jersey to prevent their ratifying the Constitution, is so far from being true, that I never exchanged one word to my remembrance or belief, with any one member of our Convention on the subject of the Constitution, until long after its ratification, or ever wrote to one of them upon that subject; nor did I use any means whatever tending to a rejection of it, which I had a right to do if I thought proper, when the Constitution was under consideration; a right which I trust I shall at all times, if necessary, exercise without fear or scruple, when our liberties are the subject of deliberation. This in brief, as near as I can state, it is the sum total of my antifOEderalism and enmity to the new government, if any are pleased to call it such. One of my opposers, in concurrence as I am told with others, has gone so far as to obtain or fabricate [a certificate](2) which has been circulated through the state, certifying, that I had tendered state securities in discharge of a debt, there being a law for that purpose in certain cases; a silly charge if true, too trifling to be noticed, were it not that great things are expected from it by its publishers. The truth after all is, that I never was possessed of such a kind of certificate as the law authorized a tender of, and that I never by myself or by any other person, either tendered or offered a certificate of any kind in payment of a debt, or for sale, except for the purchase of land over the Ohio.  Another insinuation of those civil gentlemen, my opposers (from which they draw an inference that I shall promote dessentions in the government) is, that I am opposed to a certain gentleman(3) which it is expected will be the highest officer in the government: A gentleman high in my estimation,and who in preference to all others, I wish may have the appointment to that important station. This insinuation, I am told, is founded upon a supposed transaction in Congress many years ago, which I have good reason to believe never happened, and which I never heard any intimation of till a few months past. In addition to the above, my letters are taken up and secreted, or the direction altered, and sent a contrary way to what was intended; in order to prevent a seasonable discovery of the nefarious practices of my enemies. From this short statement of facts, which duty obliges me to make, the public will judge what kind of gentlemen I have to contend with; I shall not however, at this time, make any remarks upon their illiberal and indecent conduct, but leave them to such farther measures as they may think proper to pursue; they will no doubt continue very busy, and should they confine themselves to truth, or alledge that I have not abilities equal to the important trust of a representative, I   shall not contend with them. It is strange they should attempt to propogate falshoods about me, when, from the errors I have probably committed in a long course of public service, one would imagine they might have mustered up truths sufficient to publish to my disadvantage. I must not conclude without observing, that the present is an important crisis; a new <<united> untried(4) government is to be put into operation, every thing under providence, depends upon the persons who are to conduct it; for unless wisdom and cool deliberation direct our councils, dissentions will probably arise that may end in our final ruin; which may Heaven prevent, is the sincere prayer of the public's Most obedient and humble servant,  Abra. Clark Mr. Kollock, Since I delivered you a piece for publication,(5) respecting certain matters propogated about me, in New-Jersey, I have been informed from such authority that I cannot doubt the truth of it, that it is announced in a public paper printed in Trenton, that I had declined serving as a representative to the new Congress. As I have not seen the paper, I am ignorant in what manner it is published, whether by a letter forged in my name, or information given by way of intelligence; be it in either way, it is wholly unauthorised, and void of truth, and is a new piece of villainy proceeding from the same source as the former, which I have taken notice of. Is this the way a certain gentleman,(6) once filling a high station, is to be brought forward in the election? And is he, (as may be expected from the connection) of the same principles with the chief author of the false reports against me? If so, and our representatives in general should be of the same cast, the commonality may indeed be brought to the state he supposes they ought to be. This I request you will insert in your paper, in contradiction to the report of my declining; in doing which you will oblige, Sir, Your humble servant, Abra. Clark(7) Reprinted from Shepard Kollock's NewJersey Journal (Elizabethtown), February 4, 1789. Clark's letters also appeared in the February 10 issue of both Francis Childs' New York Daily Advertiser, and Shelly Arnett's New Brunswick, N.J., Brunswick Gazette and Weekly Monitor. 1 That is, when Congress resolved September 28, 1787, to send the new Constitution to the states .

 Dear Sir, New York, 1st Feb. 1789 In addition to the letter Council will receive from our delegation,(1) I think it may be useful to give you some further information. As there is not yet a Congress, and there is not a certainty of seven states, I would submit the propriety of applying to the Secy. for foreign affairs to write to the Governor of Canada, for permission to enter the British country to make the necessary astronomical observations, & for information whether Mr. Ellicott can have the necessary supplies of provisions, boats &c., from the British posts. Mr. Gorman(2) of Massachusetts, who is among the purchasers of the cession of property by New York, to that State, is of opinion that difficulties might arise if our Geographers name (Capt. Hutchins and Jonson)(3) should appear, as he is considered by them in the light of an officer leaving their service in time of war. It may be well therefore if any thing sould prevent Mr. Ellicotts going, to keep this Circumstance in mind. I find among the papers of Congress an application from Capt. Hutchins to them in June last,(4) to take up this Business, which would have been done in a few days, but when our delegates were prepared, there ceased to be a quorum of States. The delay of this matter till the new Government meets, will throw it into the great Mass of objects that will go before them. I therefore think it will be very proper that we apply to Mr. Jay, if council approve the step without the least delay. From a variety of very important considerations respecting the western Territories of the United States, I would strongly recommend to the Government of Pennsylvania, the intersection of the County of Northumberland by a land & water communication leading to lake Erie this year. This improvement is in itself so proper and necessary that it should be done on that ground alone, but the probable course of Events in the South western country, renders it highly advisable to move in it this spring.

February 2, 1789  Tench Coxe to Benjamin Rush Dear Sir New York Feb. 2d. 1789. I enclose you a letter handed to me by Mr. John Livingston, which he informed me you were to deliver to Mr. McClay. It appears next to certain New York will not appoint Electors.(1) If they have Senators they will possess neither federalism nor mercantile Talents, nor does it appear probable that they will have one mercantile man in their representation. Thus the execution of the plan of Governmental laws, that there is no danger in comu[nica]ting commercial Arrangements to a bare Majority. New England I have some reason to believe will be unanimous for Mr. Adams. Jersey & Maryland are yet undecided about him. They wish no other man, but fear to hazard the General's election. I congratulate you on the determination of the Maryland Election. Things look well. I do not fear that we shall have an influencial Congress, federalists. I wish you would suggest to the gentlemen in Government the propriety of putting the inside of the state house in repair & of furnishing such Apartments as want it. Would it be possible to take out the floor between the Assembly Chamber & the room above so as to give it an airy appearance & to admit of a Gallery or pillars. Please to ascertain the height of the ceilings of each room. The house of reps. room here is 36 feet, & 2 more into the vault is 38 feet high. Over the Gallery which is only on the South side, is another Gallery for the Senate. I wish you would talk to some of our most active & zealous Gentlemen at once. Our citizens ought to be very attentive to the Gentlemen, who come thro our place to the New Congress---;which please also to mention---;also to their ladies. Tis in this point alone New York injures & exceeds us. I have been trying to ascertain the defects, that appear in practice, in the New York corporation, but I cannot find any body who has considered it with that view. How different a people are my fellow Citizens. It will take New York half acentury to equal us in the sensible Modes of life & in politics & science, even if we stand still. I see every day here the dangers and inconvenience of a want of information among the people at large. The want of federalism in this State arises principally from the Want of Knowlege among her Yeomanry. I therefore strongly recommend the establishment of free Schools in all the Counties (the city having already done it) and particularly among that invaluable body of our people the Germans.   I see my fellow Citizens have done me the honor to elect me again to the Manufacturing Board, which I shall stick to closely for. I daily see its advantages. Mr. Bingham ought to have been complimented with a Vice Presidents chair. I mentioned it before. I came away & hoped it would have been attended to. I wrote fully to Col. Smith and enclosed your letter for Braintree. That matter is all in a train to do well. I have been not inactive. I thank you much for that part of the letter that relates to me. Was not Genl. Stewart(2) a candidate for the Manufacturing Board, I think I have seen certain Symptoms of such a desire. I beg the favor of your not republishing any part of my letters, for in conversation I often must use the same Ideas & Language.

 Dear Sir New York Feb. 12th. 1789 I have your favor of the 5th and am glad to find our Electors will all attend.(1) I am convinced Jersey & Connecticut have thrown away a few votes from Mr Adams, andgiven him the rest and that Genl. W. will have the united voice of a free people---;a transcendant honor infinitely beyond the proudest triumphs of ancient times. Mr. Scotts resignation is very unfortunate and will probably let in Mr. Finlay(2) unless there is more sense of danger & greater exertion than I hope for. The federalists alas are men and discover sad proofs of it. Mr. Scott never having been sworn in was only a rep. elect. I am therefore clear the state legislature is competent without a writ from the fed. Government. I hope they will proceed in that way. I am content about the Effects of the publications---;and that perfectly---;but while the freedom of speaking, writing and acting remains I shall find myself at liberty to pursue the public interests in my own  February 12, 1789  way. I trust my exertions in favor of this great cause have produced upon its issue as good effects as I ever hoped from them. I know they have injured my private interest materially. The public end I consider as obtained, and my duty calls me to pay better attention to my private concerns. Seriously entertaining these opinions I can dispense with powers & honors of a seat that would render me a slave & put me in a very responsible situation. I have solid reasons to assert my popularity has not been injured throughout the Union by the intemperance or injustice of my Enemies. I have very much to disclose to you on public men & public things when frequent Meetings shall give me the opportunity. In the mean time I continue to love you & my country. Mr. Adams will undoubtedly be V Prest. Mr. Jay (entre nous) would not have objected I think---;and is not without views of a higher situation at a future day. A good use may be made of this in the Business of the Government. I have seen Mr Miller who is to call on me this day at One OClock, when I shall deliver your pacquet, & inform of your introduction to Mr. Dilly. The Ship will sail on Sunday. I wish Mr. Scott may be persuaded to serve. His resignation is unfortunate. Tho I think we shall do very well even if Finlay gets in as things now appear. The King of England remains insane and the regency seems very like to agitate the two houses extremely. Mr. Fox's doctrine is very wild, and equally dangerous to all future incumbents in the Sovereignty---;to the lords & to the commons of GB. You may be assured that the sober, the opulent and the patriotic part of the Nation are extremely uneasy at the prospect of his governing the prince. The private letters are very clear & full on this point. I cannot help thinking the present moment an awful one to the English Nation---;and one in which wisdom in America may be an infinite gain.  The accot. of the Germans I have had reprinted. It gives great pleasure hereto see so much of the History [of] that invaluable body of our Citizens. I have spoken to a member of the German Society to send a number of copies thro each of their Members to Europe. Baron Steuben is their president, and I mean to wait upon him for the purpose. So far as the Germans have emigrated to this continent human happiness has been uniformly increased. Let us labor steadily & vigorously then in the prosecution of a measure which the soundest policy dictates, & benevolence & virtue commands. I am, dr. Sir, your affectionate frd., Tench Coxe ""

 Dear Sir, 12th. Feby. 1789 at N York I wish to be informed on the following questions. Did the State of Pennsylvania become paymaster for all bona fide debts which should be brought against the Estates of persons attainted as far as the amount of the Sales should go? Those Estates having been sold for depreciated paper did the State obligate herself to discharge those debts in good money?(1) After that I shall take the liberty to ask after my friends, how does the Assembly go on---;are they of one mind or are they a monster with one body and a multifarious head. I have improved much this winter in commerce and manufactures---;they have been standing dishes with us---;although generally brought cold to table. Oh Philadelphia! thou source of light and parent of genius; if better Stars had directed my birth, I should have breathed that happy air I should have opened my eyes in a land of light. I should have been entitled to the patrimony or at least a dividend---;but alass! I am a half blood. Comparisons are always odious, but I must be indulged in comparing an old weather beaten Soldier worn down With misfortunes and battles---;with the fine gentleman from behind the counter, an adept in urbanity and perfectly skilled in the polite art of bow making. To be a little serious, we are really taught to believe that there is neither genius nor information out of Philadelphia. I intended to have asked two short questions and you see where I have wandered. Give my best respects to Mrs Nicholson and the other Ladies of my acquaintance.

 Dear Sir New York 12th Feby. 1789 Yours of 22nd ult came to hand by yesterdays Post. Mrs Dawson & her Daughter, whom I have just seen & to whom I delivered the message you sent, are in good Health and request me to present you and Family with their Respects. Mrs. Williamson says she considers herself flattered by the Wish that you and two or three other respectable Gentlemen have expressed of seeing her an Inhabitant of Edenton which by the way is the Place she has marked for her Residence but she says she is afraid that your Expectations may be founded on some Descriptions of her Qualities that are the Children of Flattery. I have written to sundry Friends that I shall offer for Edenton both in Assembly & Convention if you cannot serve, but, if you can serve the Town in Assembly then I will offer for some County in Convention only. Your Letter states a fact of which I was afraid viz that the courts will prevent you from serving in the Assembly. I think it probable that I may be at Home at or before the Election. Some farther Evidence as I take it respecting the Object of my late Appointmt. must be collected in the State which may require the attendance of Col. Thomas or myself.(1) Should this be the Case I shall try to come as I wish at the same Time to make some Arrangements for the settlement of my Family. By the Way I wish my growing attachment to domestic Life may not become too strong. I do not wish ever to possess that absolute Apathy and want of concern for the Interest of the Nation which I have often blamed in others on whose services their Country had a Claim.

 Sir New York Feby 15th 1789 When I had last the honor of exchanging some letters with you on the Subject of the improvements in Pennsa. you expressed a wish to be informed of their progress in future. The road from Tacona, (a mountain about 80 miles due north of Philada. & 20 miles West of Walpack Ferry on Delaware) to our common Boundary has been judiciously cut quite to our common boundary, which it strikes a few perches(1) West of the 5th mile stone. We have the best reason to believe it will be very soon joined to the road a little further North in your state. About ten miles South of our boundary this road branches to Tioga, wch. passage is cut also---;the latter route is 62 miles, the former 70. The Tioga road for 15 miles at the E. end was found to be injudiciously cut, wherefore a branch road was immediately opend from a place Ten miles lower down the first on Tacona road to the place on the Tioga road where Salt Lick Creek crosses it, and this will be made fit for waggons very early this Year. The state has sold in Consequence of these roads to which £1,000 paper (worth 2,000 Dollars) was given, about 250,000 Acres of land---;about 100 New Engd. families have since bought or leased of the state or landholders, and are preparing to move and the attention of our swarming Counties has been considerably diverted from Kentucky & February 15, 1789  Niagara. Encouraged by those Circumstances the state is now instituting further improvements of the same kind on that Quarter & extending their Views to a land & water Communication to lake Erie through our state, & to lake Ontario through the Tioga and the several lakes that give rise to the Seneca River. The enclosed Message from our Executive will shew you something of the business, which you will better comprehend when I inform you that the Swetard is a fine branch of Susquehannah & the Tulpohochen of Schuylkill, which approach without art or expence within 20 miles. The Navigation of the Delaware is another Object of Government & two very judicious Committees of landholders have been appointed to push that business, and the North portage, which is connected with it. Several other Objects of the same kind are in contemplation to all of which a reasonable pecuniary aid will be given by the legislature---;as also by the exertions of the landholders. Pennsylvania is influenced by two Considerations in this business, one of which ought also to influence your state---;and the other Affords very cogent reasons for exertions on your part. Our Government & people are alarmed at the great Emigrations to the Kentucky, Ohio & British lands. They see that laws cannot be made to restrain it, and if it were just to make them, that they could not be executed. They think therefore that it is indispensibly necessary to counterwork that Movement by every equitable measure. Opening roads thro the heart of our new Country, and thus exposing our unsettled Millions to the Eyes of these Emigrants, carrying conveniencies, knowlege and religion to their Doors by judicious and moderate expenditures. In the second place we find that in pursuing this plan a new field of commerce is opened to us from the inattention of our Neighbours. The fur trade of lakes Erie & Ontario now go through the waters of S Laurence to the ports of Grt. Britain when they might be diverted by New York into herchannels. The interests of the Union impel us to bring it into our state. The interests of Pennsylvania induce us to divert it from yours. I speak plainly, Sir, which is best in Matters of so much importance. Tis our wish, that you reach a common cause with us in competing with Kentucky & Niagara for settlers, & with Great Britain for the fur trade. Tis also our wish that you enter into a liberal Competition with us for that trade & for the commerce of those great tracts that lie on the Waters of Susquehannah and Delaware. As Pennsylvanians we should not say thus much, but as Citizens of two very congenial states & members of the same confederacy tis best to be open and make common cause when there is an Absolute common interest. I have the honor of being, Sir, your mo. respectf. h. Servt.,  Tench Coxe(2) February 21, 1789  [P.S.] A bill is now pending (and it is believed will pass) in our legislature to enable Aliens to purchase & hold lands in Pennsa. ""

 Dear sir New York 26th Feby. 1789 We have just received Letters from the western Country by which we  March 1, 1789  learn that a Treaty is concluded in behalf of the U.S. by Govr. Sinclair with numerous Tribes of Indians viz the Wiandots, Delawares, Chippeways, Ottowas, Potawatimas, Munsees, Sacs, and part of the Six Nations.(1) 27 Chiefs signed the Treaty. As this Treaty defeats the Hopes of Brant the half Blood who is so bitter an Enemy & so much attached to the British and has for some Time been attempting to form a general Indian-Confederacy, there is great Reason to hope that our western settlers will partake of the Benefits of this Treaty, for the Cherokees and Creeks have been invited to confederate and in Hopes of such Union it is more than probable that they have been the more turbulent. To the best of my Recollection The general Assembly at their session in Fayette Ville in the Year 1786 appointed Commissioners Genls. Rutherford, Person and some third Person were to review the Claims supposed to have been improperly settled by McCulloch, Hamford & Macken and make the proper Deductions &c. I am not informed that those Commissioners have finished or begun their work. Is it not absolutely necessary that they should finish those Accounts? Our State has a good Claim for Mony advanced or paid the Continental Line of the Army but we cannot with a good Grace charge all the Claims as good ones that were allowed by the Commissioners last mentioned after what has been published respecting that extraordinary Business. But some of the Claims were doubtless good and the State should not suffer the Loss of all. I submit to your Consideration whether the public Interest does not require that the Revisal of those Accounts be made as soon as possible.

Smith should have left Massachussetts: and since I have taken this liberty, Sir, I will do myself the pleasure to add such information as I conceive it may be any pleasure to you to receive. The returns from Virginia are recd. as far as nine, of whom six are friendly, three unfriendly to the Constitution. The Kentucky District is unknown. Hence it appears that the Dispositions of Virginia to the Constitution have become more favorable. March 1, 1789  Private letters from S. Carolina confirm the probability of their running Mr. Rutlege as Vice president, but I have great pleasure, Sir, in congratulating you on the certainty of the election of a much more acceptable and proper character to that honorable Appointment. A vessel from Georgia while I write brings information that Genl. Washington & you would have the votes of the presidential Electors, & that their reps. will probably be all federalists. There seems no doubt that John Lawrence Esqr. and Ezra LHomedieu Esqr. will represent the two southern districts of this state, tho it is uncertain whether any other person, friendly to the constitution will be carried in the other four Districts. Our last Advices render it doubtful whether the legislature will concur in any mode of electing Senators, but tis probable you will have later Advices than ours from Albany. A law of great importance has passed in Pennsa. altering the nature of tenures. Any foreigner, not being at the time of purchase an enemy, may buy & hold lands in our state. In order to make this deviation from the feudal system safely, the law confines this right to the ensuing three years. There are yet 8 Millions of Acres of land to be sold by our state. Many of these great tracts are finely situated, & of extraordinary quality. The following Gentlemen are arrived here. Of the federal Senate Messrs. Langdon, Wingate, Strong, Johnson, Ellsworth; and of the house of representatives Messrs. Thatcher, Gilman, Leonard, Gerry, Ames, Huntingdon, Tucker. Several others are mentioned by them, as to be here on the 3d. The Jersey Election is not yet closed. There seems no doubt of their being well disposed as all the candidates are known to be friendly to the constitution, except one whom I know pretty well & from whom I have no fears. With wisdom & temper, Sir, our prospects appear very comfortable, and I feel a very firm confidence that those indispensable qualities of good Governors will not bewanting.

 Sir New York 9th March 1789 On the 4th inst. according to appointment sundry Members of the new Congress viz eight Senators and fourteen of the House of Representatives met at the public Buildings in this City;(1) Since that Time the Members of the old Congress have not attempted to form a House; some of them are in the new Congress, the Remainder are chiefly gon[e] Home. You will observe by the printed Journal(2) that we have not, during the Winter, been able to form a Congress of seven States; whence it has not been in my Power to bring forward the Instruction which the last general Assembly of our State were pleased to give their Delegates.(3) It is true that seven States have been represented in Congress at one Time or another during the last three Months viz New Hampshire, Massachusets, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia & South Carolina but N. Hampshire, N York & N Jersey never chanced to be present together. The attending Members in general to whom I communicated the Purport of our Instructions were of the Opinion that the Request of the State should be granted and if I had been so fortunate as to have a Collegue I have no Doubt but that we should have obtain'd full Permission for the State to deliver in the Remainder of its Claims. Whatever Inclination I may have had occasionally to borrow a Holyday I have it in my Power to assure you, that from the Time I received the Instructions of the State, I have not been absent from the Chamber of Congress a single day at the usual Time of meeting, lest the forming of a Congress should chance to be prevented and the Interest of the State suffer by such Absence. In Case the Board of Commissioners shall refuse to receive any new Vouchers or Claims that may be offered by the State I shall think it my  March 11, 1789  Duty to petition the new Congress on that Subject, but at present I do not think that we shall find any difficulty in having the whole of our Claims examined. I formerly took the Liberty to mention that the Eastern States had very large Claims for Bounties in the recruiting Service. I have lately examined their Accounts and on some future Occasion shall give you the particulars. You will observe that the Members of the new Congress hitherto arrived are chiefly from the Eastward & I presume that a House will be formed and several Officers chosen before the southern Members arrive.

Those who feel for the honor and are solicitous for the happiness of this country are pained to the heart at the dilatory attendance of the members ap- March 21, 1789  pointed to form the two houses, while those who are averse to the new constitution, and those who are unfriendly to the liberty, and, consequently, to the happiness and prosperity of this country, exult at our languor and inattention to the public concerns, and flatter themselves that we shall continue, as we have been for some time past, the scoff of our enemies. It is now almost three weeks since the day appointed for the meeting of the two houses and for commencing the operations under the new constitution, and there are not enough arrived to form either house and to count the ballots, to see who is elected President or Vice-President.(1) What must the world think of us? But what in particular mortifies me in respect to you is that there is every reason to believe your absence will alone, on Monday next, prevent the Senators from forming a house,(2) and at the same time there is reason to believe there will be a sufficient number to form the House of Representatives, so that the eyes of the continent will be turned on you, and all the great and important business of the Union be at a stand because you are not here. I must therefore, as a friend, intreat you to lay aside all lesser concerns and private business, and come on immediately. When the house is full, as your distance from home will not be great, and as the conveyance by the stage is easy, safe, and rapid when the roads are good, you may, I doubt not, obtain leave to return and settle any business you may leave unfinished.

 Dear Sir New York 23 March 1789 Inclosed is a Letter(1) which you will be so good as forward to Col. Thomas. I have informed him that as the Board of Commissioners have been sitting some Time and the public Papers from our State and Virginia are come to Hand I should be glad to see him here, that by seeing what is done and comparing our Charges with those of other States we may determine Whether any thing remains to be done. Perhaps it may be necessary to make an Application to the new Congress on the Subject of remaining Claims but of this I can form no March 30, 1789  Opinion before Col. Thomas shall arrive. Possibly we may find that other Proofs or Vouchers should be collected in the State in this Case I shall attempt that Labour in the Summer. As I have already been longer from Home than I expected when I left Edenton, it can not be doubted that I wish to devote a few days to private Concerns. I would not borrow so much as a Week from the Service of the State and I never have been charged with truanting. Hitherto I consider myself in the Service of the State as a Member of Congress & shall continue so to do till the new Government is in Operation, hence I claim the Right of franking Letters,(2) but in the mean while I attend diligently on the Board of Commissioners to see if possible whether a thorough acquaintance with the Charges of other States cannot be of some Use to us in the statement of our own. There is a Report in Town that the King of Spain is dead---;one of his Sons & that son's Wife certainly are dead of the small Pox, at least Mr Gardoqui is in Mourning on that Account. If the King is dead we shall soon find other measures pursued respecting the Mississippi. On this Subject I have some Information that I cannot venture to commit to Paper without a Cypher. It is a Subject that so deeply concerns our State or many of its Citizens that I never lose Sight of it, and hope, on some Occasion to be able to shew that on this Head, I have done the State some Service. I have the Honour to be, with the utmost Consideration, Dear Sir, Your most obedt servt., Hu Williamson ""

 Sir New York 30th March 1789. By a Vessel from Wilmington I received a Letter dated the 13th Inst. in which is the following Paragraph viz \""The French Consul of this State(1) who you know resides here informs me that no Vessel from North Carolina will in future be admitted to enter any Port in the French West Indies unless they clear from the Port where he is to wit Wilmington.\"" Though I had no Instructions on this Head I conceived that such a Measure should not be passed over without diligent Attention since it is probable that more than three fourths of our Vessels bound for the French West Indies pass out by Oc[r]acoke & to oblige those Vessels to call at Wilmington would be insufferable. The present Situation of our State is doubtless some what singular as we are not formally in the Union and have no Claims under Treaty  March 30, 1789  to definite Privileges. In the mean Time knowing that the State is considered by foreigners as growing into much Importance and that they take for granted that we shall presently confederate I presumed that the Representations of a Delegate from North Carolina would not be neglected. Accordingly I prepared a Memorial on the Subject of the late Regulation which I put into the Hands of the Minister of France.(2) I also stated at some Length to the consul general of France(3) my Objections to that Measure. I shall not trouble you with a Transcript of those Papers for I am sure you will do me the Justice to believe that as a public Servant I endeavoured not to commit the Honour of the State. I must however observe in general that I never had Occasion to converse with those Gentlemen on any Subject respecting the commercial Interest of our State but they seemed desirous to meet our Wishes by promoting our Interest. With Respect to the Regulation in Question I have the Satisfaction to observe that you need not apprehend being troubled with the Complaints of our Merchants on that Subject. Our Trade will be permitted to move in its usual Channel till a better one can be formed and I think the Time is not very far distant when the Citizens of our State must profit considerably by commercial Regulations to which the Court of France will probably agree. With the utmost Consideration, I have the Honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient and very humble Servant, Hu Williamson ""

 Dear Sir New York April 7. 1789 I cannot express the anxiety I feel on the determination I had taken to retire to private life while so many of my friends whom I love & esteem express such an earnest desire that I should continue in a public line. I am afraid they rate my abilities too high. Sure I am they rate them much higher than I do myself and more than they deserve. But such as they are to shew that I am not unwilling to devote them to the public service I will make this proposition: that the keeping of the  April 14, 1789  great seal with the duties thereto annexed & to be annexed, and the custody & care of the papers which belonged to the late Congress be committed to me, this office to be made the depository of the acts, laws and archives of Congress; that the same salary be continued to me which the late Congress granted me & my stile be Secretary of the Senate and of the United States or Congress; & that besides necessary clerks, I be allowed a deputy who, if it be the pleasure of the Senate, may be nominated or appointed by themselves to do the ordinary business of the house, so that I may not be under the necessity of attending except on special occasions and when the great business of the nation is under deliberation.

In pursuance of the orders I received from the Senate,(1) I left New York on Tuesday, the 7th of the present month; and though much impeded by tempestuous weather, bad roads, and the many large rivers I had to cross, yet, by unremitted diligence I reached Mount Vernon, the seat of his excellency General Washington, on Tuesday, the 14th, about 12 o'clock. I found his excellency at home; and after communicating to him the object of my mission and the substance of my instructions, I took an opportunity, on the day of my arrival, to address him as follows: \""Sir, the President of the Senate, chosen for the special occasion, having opened and counted the votes of the electors in the presence of the Senate and the House of Representatives, I was honored with the commands of the Senate to wait upon your excellency with the information of your being elected to the office of President of the United States of America.

Whatever may have been my private feelings and sentiments, I believe I cannot give a greater evidence of my sensibility for the honor they have done me, than by accepting the appointment. \""I am much affected by this fresh proof of my country's esteem and confidence, that silence can best explain my gratitude---;while I realize April 24, 1789  the arduous nature of the task which is conferred on me, and feel my inability to perform it, I wish(3) there may not be reason for regretting the choice.

His progress was retarded by the tender and affectionate leave which his neighbors and friends took of him; by the congratulatory addresses which he was obliged to receive by the way; and by the testimonies of public esteem and joy, to which it was necessary for him to pay attention, in the several States through which he passed; but that this might occasion as little delay as possible, he commenced his journey every morning at sun-rise, continued it incessantly throughout the day, and supported the fatigues of it, eight days successively, till he reached this place.(4) His happy and safe arrival here yesterday having terminated my commission, I submit my conduct in the execution of it to the judgment of the Senate, and have the honor to be, with great esteem and respect, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant, Charles Thomson MS not found; reprinted from Walter Lowrie, et al., eds., American State Papers: Documents, Legislative and Executive, of the Congress of the United States, 38 vols.

 Dear Sir, New York 27th. April. 1789. With this you will receive Copies of the Laws of sundry States which  April 27, 1789  have been forwarded according to a Recommendation of Congress(1) for the use of the Legislature of Our State. I am not informed whether our State has returned like Copies of its Laws for the information of the Legislatures of other States. On Thursday next the President of the United States G. Washington is to take the Oath and enter upon the Duties of his Office. The new form of Government will then have commenced and my privilege of Franking Letters as a Member of Congress will probably be disputed.(2) I should then apply myself wholly to the Business of the public Accounts but some Weeks must elapse before the Commissioners of the United States can make any progress. One member of that Board has just taken his seat in Congress as a Representative from Georgia (Mr. Baldwin) and by a special Vote of Congress any two of the Board are not allowed to act, unless the third is present. A third Commissioner must therefore be appointed by the President(3) and he is not Authorised to make such appointment, untill Congress shall have taken Measures for that purpose and as the Revenue System engages all their Attention at present some time must necessarily pass before the third Commissioner can be ready to Act; in the mean while I propose to visit N. Carolina and to collect some Evidence of which I think we may avail ourselves considerably in the settlement of our Accounts. I am the more convinced of the usefulness of such Evidence from the Rules that the Board of Commissioners have already laid down for their General Government respecting the claims of particular States. However attentive I have been to the Board of Commissioners you observe that I have hitherto considered myself a Member of Congress by which I might the better avail myself of any oppertunity to serve the State by having access to all the Public Offices &c. It is obvious that the Revenue System now before Congress must inevitably press with much weight on the Commerce of N. Carolina. The Duty of one Dollar per Hhd. on lime iscalculated for the Meridian of Rhode Island and that on Spermaceti Candles, Cheese and Malt will have the like Operation: hitherto N. Carolina has been treated with more respect; they have only talked of duties on Naval Stores & Corn, I will try if possible to beg the Indulgence of another year. The Foreign Tonnage Duty of half a Dollar per Ton must nip our trade, suppose that 500 Vessels clear annually from N. Carolina for other States in the Union, and the Number is much greater, these Vessels at 40 Tons must pay Ten Thousand Dollars Tonnage: by such a Tax the Value of our produce must be reduced; for we have not the Monopoly. In the mean time, I do not see any means by which this particular Grievance can be escaped or procrastinated. It is a Measure that would be of great use to us, if we were in the Union by promoting Ship building. I have the Honor &c, Hu Williamson April 30, 1789  ""

 Sir Office of Secretary of Congress, May 16th. 1789. On the 5th of April 1781 An Ordinance was passed for establishing  May 16, 1789  Courts for the trial of Piracies and felonies committed on the high Seas.(1) By this Act it is Ordained that all who commit any piracy or felony on the high Seas, or who are charged as Accessories, shall be enquired of, tried & judged by grand & pettit Juries. And the Justices of the supreme or superior Courts of Judicature, and the Judge of the Court of Admiralty of the respective States, or any two or more of them are constituted and appointed Judges for hearing & trying such offenders. That upon indictment, such order, process, judgment & execution shall be used, had, done & made, to and against every such person so being indicted, as against robbers, murderers, or other felons for robbery, murder, or other felony done upon land, as by the laws of the State (in which the trial shall be held) is accustomed. And the trial of the offence if denied by the Offender, shall be had by twelve lawful Men of the county, district or precinct---;And such as shall be convicted of any such offence by verdict, confession or otherwise in the said Court, shall have & suffer such pains of death, losses of land, goods & chattles, or other punishment, and by the same Authority, as if they had been convicted and attainted of any robbery, felony or other of the said offences done upon the land, & shall be utterly excluded the benefit of Clergy, where the same is taken away or not admitted for such like offence within the body of a county, or on land where such trial shall be had. A doubt having arisen whether from the words for establishing the Courts, a Court for the trial of piracy, &c, might not be held without the Judge of the Admiralty, and this being brought before Congress, An Ordinance was passed on the 4th of March 1783 to remove this doubt.(2) By this it was ordained that on all causes to be commenced a Judge of the Admiralty should be one of the Court. Thus the business rested under the late Congress. It may be proper however to observe that on the 6th Sepr. 1785in pursuance of a motion of Mr Pinckney,(3) the Secy for foreign Affairs was directed to report to Congress a draft of an Ordinance for instituting a Court for the punishment of piracies and felonies committed on the high Seas in the same manner in all the States. In consequence of this order the Secy made a report on the 29th of the same Month, of which I enclose a copy.(4) On the 1st May 1786 this report was referred to a committee of five,(5) and this Committee was renewed on the 12th Feby. 1787, at which time it consisted of Mr Dane, Mr Johnson, Mr Kean, Mr King & Mr Benson,(6) but they never reported.
