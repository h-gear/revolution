pensylvania obtained full credit. deleware rendered little service kind maryland none none mentioned. states majority may object admitting new charges quota national debt must considerably increased nothing added credit. mentioned difficulties may arise obtaining credit amount militia services help refering act cession passed last general assembly though see journals great diversity opinions

measures use cautions last spring indicated. may duty mention incidents charges occured appear little importance occasion less trouble. congress several states haste adjourn 3d june last could obtain vote appointing commissioners treat peace southern indians though plan treaty weeks prepared committee. 4 indian war break neglect western inhabitants state would among chief sufferers. consider political military virtues brave citizens live mountain recollect great measure indebted one greatest actions atchieved late war little hurt want attention safety. massachusets late hour put r claim

strange connecticut accepted virginia cession yielded land congress without disputing title might tried foederal court tho claims congress court instituted indifferent judges. 5 another event great importance drawn attention public since adjournment. rhode island said rejected 5 per cent impost great majority assembly. impost shall finally lost north carolina bad prospect able pay quota national

prospects. well known georgia done little service war obtained extensive territory manner bounds settled peace. might yield united states least 63 millions acres retaining extent 300 miles sea. share cession could prevailed make concert would think equal greater part remains us give. different considerations mentioned may add situation indian expeditions. may recollect 22d october 1782 delegates honor express excellency hopes cession western territory take place would certain conditions first `` whole expence indian expeditions shall pass account quota continental expences.\ `` 11th september year delegates expressed uneasiness officially informed expedition going indians authorised apply congress approbation pensylvania time might pass service acct. approbation obtained whole expeditions good part militia service continues state expence. perceive great part late general assembly viewed subject different light doubtless reason omitted stipulation mentioned conditions amount seem thought militia services whether pointed tawney white savages ought pass continental account. ever case cost us much trouble obtain credit. observe three measures greatly interested promoting viz rhode island georgia agree 5 per cent impost georgia cede part territory expences indian expeditions paid united states. western territory belonging state managed promote several interests. last mentioned may doubtless secure. immediately complete cession shall give power making advantageous terms shall loose argument may bring others adopt foederal measures hand sell remains territory western inhabitants whatever inconveniences may suffer loose prospect becoming seperate state quota state doubled though shall hardly means paying half present quota case give means making terms power adopting better measures better present. situation critical. perhaps consistent prudence sound policy make pause. whatever shall finally appear honor true interest state may done 12 months hence well. may wrong things undone. among acts last assembly one empowering congress final settlement proportion state bear whole expences war foreign loan excepted adopt principles may seem without wholy governed rule laid 8th article confederation. 6 appears expectation state congress would come settlement allot state portion pay national debt foreign loan excepted quota state might discharge could least balance quota. doubtless delegates press settlement nothing could fortunate state measure warmly opposed states vacant lands question already agitated. reason pretty clear states may refuse divide national debt. according present allotments maryland one states vacant territory would pay 94 dollars every thousand north carolina would pay 72. soon vacant territory shall located surveyed quota according existing rule would near 148. need say georgia would pay 200 whose quota hour 10 quota maryland must decrease encreasing. however ungenerous may seem think burthening posterity national debt throwing half round neck infant states rising tother side mountains people ashamed cherish sentiments kind. letter massachusets observe congress still haunted old continental money. justice sound policy require manes get repose. massachusets called 40 millions quota discovers near 30 millions remaining hands individual citizens. excellency may wonder made discovery find much
